<text>The Wolfe Tones are an Irish rebel music band that incorporate Irish traditional music in their songs. Formed in 1963, they take their name from Theobald Wolfe Tone, one of the leaders of the Irish Rebellion of 1798, with the double meaning of a wolf tone; a sound that can affect instruments in the string family of the orchestra.

==History==
===1963–1964: Formation===
The origins of the group date back to August 1963, where three neighbouring children from the Dublin suburb of Inchicore, Brian Warfield, Noel Nagle, and Liam Courtney, had been musical friends from childhood. In August 1964, Brian&#x27;s brother Derek Warfield joined the band, and in November 1964 Tommy Byrne replaced Courtney, creating the band&#x27;s most recognizable line-up, which would last for nearly 37 years until January 2001.

===1964–2001===
In 1995, Derek Warfield released a solo studio album entitled &quot;Legacy&quot; as he was still eligible to record under his own name. With Derek on vocals and mandolin, the music on this album was performed by a new band, although he was still touring with the Wolfe Tones. Derek&#x27;s solo releases continued annually until 2006.

===2001–present===
The Wolfe Tones continued to tour as a three-piece band.

In 2022–2024, the band played shows in the Olympia Theatre, Dublin, the INEC Ireland, Broadway (Manhattan) in New York, the Atheneum Chicago and Electric Picnic.

However, they announced their retirement in 2023, with a 60th-anniversary tour to conclude their career. As well as gigs in the US, the band played concerts at Galway Airport, Castlebar, Co. Mayo and in the 3Arena, with the band&#x27;s advertised final gig taking place in Dublin on 13 October 2024.

On 23 August 2024, the band released a final single, &quot;Goodbye to All Our Friends&quot;.

Despite the 3Arena show being advertised as the bands final gig, the band announced two shows at Thomond Park in Limerick for July 2025, as well as a gig in Liverpool.

== Notable works ==

The song &quot;Irish Eyes&quot; was written by Brian Warfield as a paean for his mother Kathleen who died of cancer the year prior to its release. A song about emigration to London entitled &quot;My Heart is in Ireland&quot; became a number 2 hit for the band. The song &quot;Celtic Symphony&quot; was written by Warfield in 1987 for the centenary of Celtic Football Club. Other songs written by the group include &quot;Joe McDonnell&quot;, a song about the life and death of the Provisional IRA member Joe McDonnell, who was the fifth person to die on the 1981 Hunger Strike; and &quot;The Protestant Men&quot;, a song about notable Protestant Irish nationalists. The band also covered &quot;The Streets of New York&quot;, written by Liam Reilly from Bagatelle who was inspired by stories of the Tones&#x27; friendship with the NYPD.

Footballer James McClean attracted criticism when he tweeted that he listened to their rendition of The Broad Black Brimmer before a match, a song in which a son learns of how his father was killed in fighting for the IRA. He was told by club manager Martin O&#x27;Neill to refrain from using Twitter.

In 2002, after an allegedly orchestrated e-mail campaign by fans to &quot;try and mess it up&quot; their rendition of &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot; by Thomas Osborne Davis was voted the number one song of all time in a BBC World Service poll. The BBC hosts an artist&#x27;s page for the band that includes excerpts of their songs.

The band&#x27;s 1982 hit Admiral William Brown pays homage to the Irish-born Argentine sailor William Brown.

In January 2020, the band&#x27;s version of &quot;Come Out Ye Black and Tans&quot; reached No. 1 on the Ireland and UK iTunes charts, following criticism of the Irish government&#x27;s planned commemoration of the RIC, as part of its &#x27;Decade of Commemoration&#x27;. As a result of this, on 10 January, the song entered the Irish Singles Chart at No. 33 and also debuted at No. 1 in the Scottish Singles Chart.

<text>Altona is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hobsons Bay local government area. Altona recorded a population of 11,490 at the .

Altona is a large suburb consisting of low density residential in the south-eastern half and mixed industry in the north-western half. A feature of the suburb is Altona Beach, which is one of only two swimming beaches in the western suburbs (the other being Williamstown Beach). 

Altona takes its name from the then-independent German city of Altona which is today a borough of Hamburg.

==History==

Prior to arrival of Europeans, the Altona area was home to Kurung-Jang-Balluk Aboriginal people, of the Woiwurrung clan.

Altona was first permanently settled in 1842, with the construction of The Homestead by Alfred Langhorne. The name &#x27;Altona&#x27; first appeared on maps in 1861. It was named by Frederick Taegtow, a German who hailed from Altona, then a town just outside of Hamburg. Taegtow believed that coal was to be found in the area, and in 1881 he formed the Williamstown (Taegtow) Prospecting Company. From 1886, housing in the Altona and Merton Street estates was sold, and by 1901 the Victorian Government owned an explosives reserve in the west of Altona.

On 20 February 1911, J. J. Hammond flew the first cross country flight between towns in Australia from Altona Bay to Geelong in Victoria, and on 23 February, also at Altona Bay, he undertook the first powered passenger flight in Australia.

Coal mining formed the basis of the local economy from 1908 to 1919. However, this was brought to an end in 1930 when open cut mining was developed in the Latrobe Valley.

By 1918 the population was sufficient to justify a Post Office which opened on 14 January 1918.

Following the Second World War Altona received a large influx of immigrants, primarily from the Mediterranean, Central Europe and a smaller number from the Middle East.

From 1862 Altona was a town in the Shire of Werribee, but in 1957, the Altona Riding of the Shire, which included Altona itself as well as Altona North and Altona Meadows, was severed, and became the City of Altona in 1968. This was merged into the City of Hobsons Bay in June 1994 under local government amalgamations undertaken by the Kennett government.

==Politics==
On 24 June 2010, Altona became home to Australia&#x27;s first female prime minister, Julia Gillard, a then resident of Altona. Gillard was voted in by the governing Australian Labor Party to replace Kevin Rudd as its leader, making her Australia&#x27;s 27th Prime Minister.

==Population==

According to the , there were 10,762 people in Altona, with 64.6% of Altona residents born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.8%, New Zealand 2.3%, Malta 2.1%, India 1.7% and Italy 1.6%. 73.3% of residents only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 2.3%, Maltese 2.2%, Mandarin 1.7%, Vietnamese 1.3% and Greek 1.3%. The most common responses for religion in were No Religion 33.2%, Catholic 30.5% and Anglican 8.9%.

==Parks and gardens==

Altona has many significant parks and gardens, including some important environmental conservation areas and wetlands along the shores of Port Phillip. These are also used by visitors and residents recreationally and include a long promenade along the bay. Notable areas include:
* Kororoit Creek
* Cherry Lake
* Altona Coastal Park
* Truganina Coastal Parklands

==Education==

Altona has four primary schools consisting of Altona Primary School, Seaholme Primary School, Altona College (a merger between the former Altona Secondary College and Altona West Primary School) and St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic Primary School. The secondary schools include Mount St. Joseph Girls&#x27; College and Altona College (Altona Secondary College changed its name in 2007 to Altona P-9 College, then in 2019 included years 10-12).

Altona has a library branch, which contains the Environmental Resources Centre. This centre provides the community with access to media related to environmental initiatives in Hobsons Bay, including Industry Environment Improvement Plans from local industry.

==Culture==

The Altona Beach Festival is a free event held annually at the Logan Reserve precinct, (located on the Esplanade and includes the Logan Reserve parklands, part of Pier Street and the Esplanade), to promote and celebrate Hobsons Bay and the western suburbs. The festival includes a twilight street parade, beach market, double-decker bus tour, professional entertainers, RAAF fly-overs and fireworks off the Altona Pier.

The Altona Beach Festival was previously known as the Bayside Festival and also Operation Recreation, and some residents still refer to it by one of these names. The 30th anniversary of the festival was held in 2007. It enjoyed a brief period of heightened prominence in 2002 when it was featured on the Channel 9 travel program Postcards in a segment hosted by Geoff Cox. Scouts Australia is a major feature of the parade and the many community activities that take place close to the beach front.

The Altona City Theatre is a production company based in the Altona Civic Theatre, producing two major musicals and a smaller pantomime annually. The pantomime coincides with the Bayside Festival and was originally intended as an outlet for young directors.

Scouts Australia has two groups in Altona. The 1st Altona Scout Group runs from the Scout Hall. The 4th Altona Scout Group are located at the Pines, an old camp owned by the City of Hobsons Bay.

==Sport==
Altona is home to many sporting clubs including Australian rules football, soccer, hockey, basketball, cricket and lacrosse. Melbourne Ballpark is a baseball complex in the west of Altona.

Altona is represented by many sporting teams, including the Altona Magic soccer team which competes in the Victorian State League Division 1, the third tier in Australia behind the A-League and the Victorian Premier League. Altona City SC plays in Victorian State League Division 2 N/W.

Altona has an Australian Rules football team competing in the Western Region Football League.

The Altona Roosters complete in the Victorian Rugby League, and play home games at Loft Reserve, in neighbouring Newport.

Golfers play at the course of the Kooringal Golf Club on Wilga Avenue.

The area of Altona beach directly west of Altona Pier is one of Melbourne&#x27;s most popular spots for kitesurfing.

==Transport==
===Trains ===
Altona has two railway stations; Altona and Westona, both of which are on the Altona Loop. This is one of the two lines that runs between Newport and Laverton stations (the other being a Newport direct Express to Laverton track that operates along the former Geelong railway line, located along the northern boundary of Altona). Early morning and late night services to Werribee, as well as all weekend services, run via the Altona loop. At other times, the Altona loop is serviced by Laverton services.

===Bus===
* Route 411: Laverton station to Footscray (via Altona Meadows and Altona)
* Route 412: Laverton station to Footscray (via Altona Meadows and Altona)
* Route 415: Laverton station to Williamstown (via Altona)
* Route 903: Altona to Mordialloc (SMARTBUS Service)
* Route 944: City to Point Cook (Night Bus Service)

===Other===
The Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail, a shared path for cyclists and pedestrians, follows the coast through Altona. It links up with a path around Cherry Lake. Most major roads have on-road cycleways.

==Industry==

Local industry includes petrochemical storage, manufacturing and distribution. The Altona Petrochemical Complex was established in the early 1960s, utilising feedstocks from the nearby Altona Refinery, and later the Bass Strait gas fields, to produce a wide range of products for the chemical and plastics industry. The complex grew to become the largest petrochemical installation in the southern hemisphere and included major global chemical companies such as Dow Chemicals, Union Carbide, Hoechst, BF Goodrich and BASF. This was a major environmental concern to residents in the 1970s and 1980s. Strict environmental controls and local projects involving industry, government and environmental groups have reduced these concerns, cleaning up coastal areas that were once neglected.

The Toyota Australia Altona Plant is located in the neighbouring suburb of Altona North. The plant built Camrys and Aurions, 80% of which were for the world market. The plant was closed in 2017.

==Notable people==

Julia Gillard was an Altona resident while serving as Australia&#x27;s 27th Prime Minister.

Adrian Tantari, Queensland politician,
and Lauren Edwards, British Labour Party MP for Rochester and Strood, were born in Altona.

<text>Laverton established in 1886, is a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Hobsons Bay and Wyndham local government areas. Laverton recorded a population of 4,760 at the 2021 census.

It was home to the RAAF Base (RAAF Williams), and covers in the suburb of Laverton. Laverton was originally established to support the greater rate of flying and maintenance activities after the formation of the RAAF in 1921. Many homes in the surrounding area were colloquially called the “cabbage patch”, in reference to the boom of young families after the return of soldiers from WWII. Fences in the area also used to be low (below ) to originally form a shared community with no fence at the front. This style has recently been changed particularly on the main arterials throughout Laverton with higher fences being built in line with local council building policies. The military airfield at RAAF Williams, Laverton was decommissioned and has now been developed into a new suburb – Williams Landing.
The Laverton base and airfield was established by the Royal Australian Air Force on 01 March 1926, and is the third oldest RAAF base in Australia. Home to No. 1 Aircraft Depot between 1926 and 1994, Laverton has also housed flying units, Support and Training Command Headquarters, No. 6 RAAF Hospital and training and administrative functions. The airfield was officially closed in 1996 and subsequently sold for suburban housing development.

Laverton Swim and Fitness Centre (LSFC), originally called Laverton Memorial Swimming Pool, was proudly funded by the residents and Werribee Shire council (who owned the suburb of Laverton prior to 2014 handover to Hobsons Bay City Council). It opened in June 1976 and was dedicated to those who had served in various conflicts in which Australia had been involved. A WWII memorial plaque was installed, however removed or possibly stolen and is to be replaced with an identical plaque in 2022. A petition was launched by Laverton Residents in 2020, in support by Wetlands Ward Councillors as part of their campaign to be voted in, however a decision by the previous council in 2021 was made to close the pool, supported by the Wetlands Ward councillors in 2022, to instead build a new state-of-the-art pool in the neighbouring suburb of Altona Meadows for $60m as part of the Western Aquatic Strategy 2019-2030. The feasibility of this project to break ground at the new site of Bruce Comben Reserve, Altona Meadows - is to be reviewed by February 2023.

Other notable Laverton facilities are the Woods Street Art Space, The Hub community Centre and many up and coming new restaurants and cafes with upgrades planned to support the growth of the suburb (7,500 by 2031 up from approximately 4,700 as per 2021 census).

Laverton is home to the Melbourne Ballpark state baseball stadium, which hosts several national events each year, including home games of the Melbourne aces who compete in the Australian Baseball League. The facility resides on what is known as the Altona Meadows side of the M1 freeway.

Laverton is connected to the Werribee railway line at Laverton station and Aircraft station.

Laverton is serviced by a network of primary and secondary state arterial roads, including major arterials such as the Princes Freeway, where there is an entry ramp via Point Cook Road (Aviation Road), and 5 exits into and out of Laverton.

Replacement of the railway crossing with a bridge at Aircraft station was finished in 2019 and future potential works to reroute traffic from and to Point Cook Road, which is predominantly used by city bound Point Cook residents travelling by vehicle.

<text>Newport is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hobsons Bay local government area. Newport recorded a population of 13,658 at the 2021 census.

Newport is approximately 10 minutes by car from Melbourne via the West Gate Freeway or a 20-minute train journey from Flinders Street.

==History==

The Yalukit-willam people of the Boon-wurrung Country are the traditional owners of land known as Newport, with a well researched connection to the area beyond 30,000 years. First contact came with European sealers (1803–1834) and followed a pattern of violence typical across Australia at the time. In 1835, the arrival of John Batman saw a treaty established and a period of relative peace. However, despite this the plight of the Australian Aborigines was dire, as they were increasingly denied ownership and access to their lands.

European settlement began in Newport at what was then called Williamstown Junction around 1862, with a Telegraph Office and Post Office by 1869. It was renamed Newport in 1881. The Newport Railway Workshops played a key role in the development of the suburb, formerly the main workshops of the Victorian Railways. The workshops are just south of the Newport railway station. The Newport Power Station is another feature of the suburb, the chimney of which remains one of the tallest towers in Melbourne at 183 metres. The original coal-fired generators were replaced in 1981 with a single 510MW gas-fired generator and operates during peak-load periods.

==Today==

Newport is home to people of a diverse mix of ethnic, social and economic backgrounds. It has a Mosque, a Baptist church, Catholic schools, tattoo parlours, Asian and Italian restaurants, sports clubs, boutique wine bars and an RSL. It has 12 playgrounds within just 5 km2. The Substation community arts centre provides a hub for local live music performances, art exhibitions, community events and the monthly artists market. The Newport Railway Museum opens to the public on weekends, with a collection that includes many locomotives and carriages built at the Newport Railway Workshops. The Newport Folk Festival is held each year in June. Major natural features of the suburb include the Newport Lakes, Greenwich Bay and the Sandy Point Conservation area. Fishing, bike riding, skateboarding, kayaking and boating are popular local activities.

==Recreation==

Newport Lakes Park is a bushland oasis created from a former bluestone quarry. The park is 33 hectares in size and has been extensively revegetated using native plants, with over 200 species of plants and 85 species of birds recorded here.

Regular events include the annual Substation Contemporary Art Prize, the Carpark Fiesta, the monthly Artists&#x27; Market, the Koori Night Market, children&#x27;s theatre, Westside Circus, dance classes, life-drawing, public forums, an art exhibition program across 5 gallery spaces and a diverse range of performance including cabaret, comedy, jazz and contemporary music.

<text>Spotswood is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hobsons Bay local government area. Spotswood recorded a population of 2,820 at the .

The suburb is bounded by the Newport–Sunshine freight railway line in the west, the West Gate Freeway in the north, the Yarra River in the east and the Burleigh Street in the south.

Spotswood was named after John Stewart Spotswood, who was one of the first farmers who owned much of the area in the 1840s.

==History==

Spottiswoode Post Office opened on 1 February 1882 and was renamed Spottiswood around 1903 and Spotswood around 1906.

==Locality==

Spotswood is known for the Victorian Science Museum, known as Scienceworks. Scienceworks is near the old sewage pumping station of Spotswood, constructed in 1897. This location was also used as the police headquarters in &quot;Mad Max&quot; and for the Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Harvie Krumpet&quot;.

==Film==

Spotswood was the setting of the eponymous Australian film, &quot;Spotswood&quot;, made in 1990–1991, released in 1992, starring Anthony Hopkins. Most of the scenes in Spotswood were shot in the suburb, but the moccasin factory is fictional and doesn&#x27;t exist in Spotswood; the factory scenes in the movie were shot in the old sewage pumping station. Moccasins are a derogatory stereotype for the western suburbs of Melbourne; implying a lack of class, culture and sophistication even though they are commonly used elsewhere in Australia. The suburb was the main location in the clay animation short-film &quot;Harvie Krumpet&quot;.

==Transport==

Spotswood railway station is served by train services on the Werribee and Williamstown lines. Several bus routes also traverse the suburb. 

==Sport==

<text>Williamstown is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, south-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hobsons Bay local government area. Williamstown recorded a population of 14,407 at the 2021 census.

==History==
===Indigenous history===
Indigenous Australians occupied the area long before maritime activities shaped the modern historical development of Williamstown. The Yalukit-willam clan of the Kulin nation were the first people to call Hobsons Bay home. They roamed the thin coastal strip from Werribee to Williamstown/Hobsons Bay.

The Yalukit-willam were one clan in a language group known as the Bunurong, which included six clans along the coast from the Werribee River, across the Mornington Peninsula, Western Port Bay to Wilsons Promontory.

The Yalukit-willam referred to the Williamstown area as &quot;koort-boork-boork&quot;, a term meaning &quot;clump of she-oaks&quot;, literally &quot;She-oak, She-oak, many.&quot;

===Colonial exploration and settlement===
In November 1835, Captain Robson Coltish, master of the barque &quot;Norval&quot; sailed from Launceston, then crossing Bass Strait with a cargo of 500 sheep and 50 Hereford cattle which had been consigned by Dr. Alexander Thomson. After reaching the coastline of Port Phillip, Captain Coltish chose the area now known as Port Gellibrand, as a suitable place to unload his cargo.

When Governor Richard Bourke and Captain William Lonsdale visited the emergent settlement at Port Phillip in 1837, they both felt the main site of settlement at Point Gellibrand would emerge at the estuary and they renamed it William&#x27;s Town after King William IV, then the English monarch. It served as the Settlement of Port Phillip&#x27;s first anchorage and as the centre for port facilities until the late 19th century.

Williamstown was initially considered along with the sites that became known as Geelong and Melbourne for the capital of the new colony at Port Phillip. Although Williamstown offered excellent proximity to anchorage, Melbourne was ultimately chosen due to its abundance of fresh water. Wiliamstown remained an important port of the new colony, and the first streets of old William&#x27;s Town were laid out in 1837 with that in mind.

The first land sales in the area took place in 1837. A 30-metre stone jetty was built by convict labour in 1838 where Gem Pier now stands. That same year a ferry service between Melbourne and Williamstown was established aboard the steamer &quot;Fire Fly&quot;. It was used to convey passengers, as well as sheep and cattle from Tasmania.
The first lighthouse, a wooden one with an oil-burning beacon at the top, was erected at Point Gellibrand in 1840. In that same year a water police superintendent was appointed to Williamstown. Williamstown remains the present-day home of the Victorian Water Police.

A bluestone lighthouse was built in 1849–50 to replace the original wooden one. It only operated as a lighthouse until 1860, when a Pile Light was built and anchored off Shelly Beach, after which it served as a time ball tower.

===Victorian gold rush and wheat boom===

Williamstown had been a primitive settlement until the Victorian gold rush of the 1850s, but after the gold seekers began to arrive, many from the tin mines of Cornwall, and many more from the Californian gold fields, the settlement&#x27;s growth was phenomenal. The first Williamstown Post Office opened on 1 March 1850.

Australia&#x27;s first telegraph line began operating between Melbourne and Williamstown on 3 March 1854. At this time, the timeball was moved to the Telegraph Station at Point Gellibrand. The &quot;Williamstown Chronicle&quot;, the first Victorian suburban newspaper, was established in 1854. The Williamstown Freemasons chapter was also established in 1854.

Fort Gellibrand was built in 1855 during the Crimean War, to guard against a possible Russian invasion.

The first lightship to mark the reef off Point Gellibrand was the former barque &quot;New Constitution&quot; which the Government purchased in October 1856 for £1050. It took up station on 25 July 1859. In May 1860, tenders were called for construction of a new lightship off Point Gellibrand. The new lightship consisted of two white lights of equal height, apart, and was shown from a temporary anchor in 4.5 fathoms of water. This lightship guarded Gellibrand&#x27;s Point reef from 1861 until 1895.

Williamstown Post Office (the oldest post office building still standing in Victoria) and a Mechanics Institute were built in 1860. By 1861 Williamstown had 13 slips for boat repairs and building, and pier accommodation for 40 vessels. In 1864, the town boundaries of Williamstown were expanded to take in Newport and Spottiswoode, later to become Spotswood. Piped water from Yan Yean water supply subsequently arrived, allowing more rapid growth.

The Williamstown Racing Club, founded in 1864, was once one of the senior thoroughbred racing clubs in Victoria. Built in 1872, the Williamstown Racecourse, with its large and elaborately decorated grandstand facing out to the sea, was considered one of the finest in Australia. The Williamstown Football Club, an Australian rules football club was formed in 1864.

===CSS Shenandoah incident of 1865===
The Confederate States Navy warship CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, which had successfully attacked several Union ships in the Indian Ocean, sailed into Hobsons Bay on the afternoon of 25 January 1865.

An 1871 hearing at the International Court in Geneva awarded damages of £820,000 against Britain to the US government for use of the port at Williamstown by the CSS &quot;Shenandoah&quot;.

===Victoria&#x27;s major cargo port===
Between 1857 and 1889, the main railway workshops of the Victorian Railways were at Point Gellibrand, and at their height covered 85% of Point Gellibrand. Imported steam locomotives were assembled at the Williamstown Workshops. After 1889 the extensive workshops were moved to nearby Newport.

The Alfred Graving Dock is historically significant as the first graving dock in Victoria and the third in Australia at that time, for its role in the development of the shipping industry in Port Phillip, for its continuous use as a Dockyard since its completion and for association with William Wardell during his term as Inspector General of the Public Works Department.

Williamstown Baptist Church was officially founded in 1868, though a congregation had begun to form eight years earlier in response to an advertisement in the &quot;Williamstown Chronicle&quot; dated Saturday, 24 November 1860. Baptismal services were performed at the back beach at Williamstown from 1861 through to 1868, the first being performed 10 March 1861 by the Rev. David Rees of South Yarra. The Oddfellows&#x27; Hall was rented for services from December 1868. The Presbyterian schoolroom in Cecil Street was later used, followed by the Temperance Hall from April 1870. The Tabernacle, now the Church of Christ on Douglas Parade, was used after this. In January 1876 services reverted to the Oddfellows&#x27; Hall. In 1884 the Baptist Church building on Cecil Street was officially opened.

In 1873, the Royal Yacht Club of Victoria, founded in May 1853 as the Port Phillip Yacht Club, moved to its present site at 120 Nelson Place, adjacent to Gem Pier.

Williamstown North Primary School was established in 1874 and in that same year part of the market reserve was purchased from the Williamstown Council by the Education Department in order to build the Williamstown Primary School No. 1183.

The Williamstown CYMS football club was formed in 1886 and remains one of the oldest sporting clubs in Australia.

The Hobsons Bay Yacht Club, situated on Nelson Place at the end of Ferguson Street and adjacent to the pier.

The Yacht Club Hotel was built in 1892 at 207 Nelson Place, a site previously occupied by an iron-framed &#x27;wooden&#x27; hotel called the Lord Clyde. It was owned by Carlton and West End Breweries, later the Carlton Brewery Ltd.

The Williamstown Hospital opened in 1894 when the community responded to the increasing risk of accidents from a busy port, the railway workshops and the growing industrial area of Newport, Spotswood and Footscray to establish Melbourne&#x27;s first suburban public general hospital.

Williamstown Central Tennis Club is on a site at the corner of Ferguson Street and Melbourne Road.

The Williamstown Lacrosse Club was founded in 1898 at a meeting in the Williamstown Baptist Sunday School called by Arthur Whitley (son of the Minister). Arthur Whitley became the first Captain and Fred Scott the first secretary.

===20th century===
Williamstown Pier railway station was opened on 8 January 1905. The station existed primarily to serve the Williamstown docks precinct and was the terminus of the Williamstown line.

In 1906, one of the largest undertakings attempted by ship repairers in Australia was successfully accomplished at the Williamstown Dockyard. SS &quot;Peregrine&quot;, a 1,660 GRT vessel of the Howard Smith Line, was lengthened amidships by . This was perhaps the first jumboising operation undertaken in Australia.

The Williamstown Hospital was expanded with the addition of the Male Ward in 1911 and the Female Ward in 1917.

Heidelberg School impressionist artist Walter Withers painted numerous landscapes of Williamstown around 1910, at a time when fellow Heidelberg School impressionist artist Frederick McCubbin was also painting the Williamstown landscape. Between 1909 and 1915, McCubbin visited Williamstown on numerous occasions and produced sketches and watercolours of the foreshore and the old shipyards. He also produced a major oil painting of the Williamstown docks in 1915.
Williamstown was proclaimed a City on 17 May 1919. Construction of the Williamstown Town Hall on Ferguson Street commenced a year earlier in 1918, but it was not officially opened until 1927.

The Williamstown and Newport Anglers Club was formed in 1933 and rented premises at 221 Nelson Place, moving next door to 223 in March 1935. In August 1939, the club was granted a site on the Esplanade and in 1941 a clubhouse was opened. A jetty and slipway were built the following year.

In 1934, the bluestone time ball tower (the former lighthouse) was extended by with a circular brick tower on top. The extension was then painted with a coat of aluminium paint and it was re-established as a lighthouse due to the loss of singularity against the light of the City behind the Point Gellibrand Pile Light. It was electric, gave a green and red light, had a visibility of and operated as a lighthouse from 1934 to 1987.

Also in 1946, nine Williamstown residents met to form the Williamstown Little Theatre Movement. Through the 1950s and 1960s, Williamstown Little Theatre had several homes in Williamstown; from the Mechanic&#x27;s Institute to the Williamstown Town Hall Supper Room and the former Missions to Seamen building in Nelson Place. In 1967 the theatre company moved into its current venue, a converted bakery on Albert Street.

In 1948, an electoral redistribution saw Williamstown included in the new Australian Federal electoral Division of Gellibrand, named after Joseph Tice Gellibrand (1786–1836).

The Pile Light anchored off Shelly Beach in 1860 was destroyed in 1976 when it was hit by the &quot;Melbourne Trader&quot;, a vessel of 7,000 tonnes. The force of the collision snapped the piles at waterline area, the light was sheared off its piles at water level, pushed sideways, and was left hanging precariously on several of the remaining piles.

The Urban Land Authority developed 60 hectares of the estate for housing and related commercial and community activities. Residential allotments were progressively released for sale from May 1991. The historic armoury building of the old rifle range was preserved, refurbished and is now as a funeral home set in a large formal garden.

The remaining 50 hectares was reserved for the protection of the surrounding environmentally sensitive area. This area, now known as the Jawbone Flora and Fauna Reserve consists of open grasslands for passive recreation, two wetland lakes, the saltmarsh and mangrove conservation area, Wader Beach and the Kororoit Creek.

<text>Roy Beggs Jr (born 3 July 1962) is an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) politician, serving as a Mid and East Antrim Councillor for the Larne Lough DEA since 2023. Beggs served as a Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly from 2011 to 2016, and 2020 to 2022. He was a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) for East Antrim from 1998 to 2022.

==Political career==

Beggs was first elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly for East Antrim at the 1998 election, where he topped the poll. 

At the 2001 local elections, he was elected to Carrickfergus Borough Council, representing the Knockagh District. 

During this period, he had been elected as Chairman of the District Policing Partnership and vice-chairman of the Local Strategic Partnership and of the Community Safety Partnership.

Beggs was re-elected to the Assembly at the 2003 election, with 16.7% of first-preference votes. 

At the 2007 Assembly election, Beggs was elected on the 12th count with 10.2% of first-preference votes.

Beggs did not seek re-election as a councillor in the 2011 local elections, but did retain his Assembly seat in the Assembly election held the same day. 

Following this, Beggs was elected as a Deputy Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly. He served as a member of the Assembly&#x27;s Social Development Committee, Public Accounts Committee, Health Committee, Environment Committee, Finance Committee, Deputy Chairman of the Agriculture Committee and Regional Development Committee. He is the Ulster Unionist Party spokesperson on Social Development.

Beggs was the Ulster Unionist candidate for East Antrim at the 2015 UK General election, where he came second to the incumbent MP, Sammy Wilson, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). 

He lost his seat to Danny Donnelly of the Alliance Party in the 2022 Assembly election.

In the 2023 local elections, Beggs was elected onto Mid and East Antrim Borough Council as his party’s representative for the Larne Lough District.

==Personal life==
Beggs is the son of the politician Roy Beggs, who was the UUP Member of Parliament (MP) for East Antrim from 1983 to 2005.

In 2003, Beggs succeeded in having Irish rebel music removed from the in-flight entertainment of Aer Lingus airplanes. He complained of the &quot;blatant promotion of militant, armed republicanism&quot; on a music channel during a flight from Dublin to Boston after seeing that Derek Warfield had a radio channel dedicated to his music. Beggs, it was the same as &quot;the speeches of Osama Bin Laden being played on a trans-Atlantic Arabian airline.&quot; Aer Lingus removed the material from their flights, stating: &quot;It is something that should not have been on board and we removed it immediately we became aware of it.&quot;

<text>The Nigerian Civil War (6 July 1967 – 15 January 1970), also known as the Biafran War, was fought between Nigeria and the Republic of Biafra, a secessionist state which had declared its independence from Nigeria in 1967. Nigeria was led by General Yakubu Gowon, and Biafra by Lieutenant Colonel Chukwuemeka &quot;Emeka&quot; Odumegwu Ojukwu. The conflict resulted from political, ethnic, cultural and religious tensions which preceded the United Kingdom&#x27;s formal decolonisation of Nigeria from 1960 to 1963. Immediate causes of the war in 1966 included a military coup, a counter-coup, and anti-Igbo pogroms in the Northern Region. The pogroms and the exodus of surviving Igbos from the Northern Region to the Igbo homelands in the Eastern Region led the leadership of the Eastern Region (whose population was two-thirds Igbo) to conclude that the Nigerian federal government would not protect them and that they must protect themselves in an independent Biafra.

Within a year, Nigerian government troops surrounded Biafra, and captured coastal oil facilities and the city of Port Harcourt. A blockade was imposed as a deliberate policy during the ensuing stalemate which led to the mass starvation of Biafran civilians. During the years of the war, there were about 100,000 overall military casualties, while between 500,000 and 2 million Biafran civilians died of starvation.

Alongside the concurrent Vietnam War, the Nigerian Civil War was one of the first wars in human history to be televised to a global audience. In mid-1968, images of malnourished and starving Biafran children saturated the mass media of Western countries. The plight of the starving Biafrans became a &quot;cause célèbre&quot; in foreign countries, enabling a significant rise in the funding and prominence of international non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Biafra received international humanitarian aid from civilians during the Biafran airlift, an event which inspired the formation of Doctors Without Borders following the end of the war. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were the main supporters of the Nigerian government, while France, Israel (after 1968), and some other countries supported Biafra. The United States&#x27; official position was one of neutrality, considering Nigeria as &quot;a responsibility of Britain&quot;, but some interpret the refusal to recognise Biafra as favouring the Nigerian government.

The war highlighted challenges within pan-Africanism during the early stages of African independence from colonial rule, suggesting that the diverse nature of African people may present obstacles to achieving common unity. Additionally, it shed light on initial shortcomings within the Organization of African Unity. The war also resulted in the political marginalization of the Igbo people, as Nigeria has not had another Igbo president since the end of the war, leading some Igbo people to believe they are being unfairly punished for the war. Igbo nationalism has emerged since the end of the war, as well as various neo-Biafran secessionist groups such as the Indigenous People of Biafra and Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra.

==Background==

===Ethnic division===
This civil war can be connected to the colonial amalgamation in 1914 of the British Northern Protectorate, Lagos Colony, and Southern Nigeria Protectorate, which was intended for better administration due to the proximity of these protectorates. However, the change did not take into consideration the differences in the culture and religions of the people in each area. Competition for political and economic power exacerbated tensions.

Nigeria gained independence from the United Kingdom on 1 October 1960, with a population of 45.2 million made up of more than 300 differing ethnic and cultural groups. When the colony of Nigeria was created, its three largest ethnic groups were the Igbo, who formed about 60–70% of the population in the southeast; the Hausa-Fulani of the Sokoto Caliphate, who formed about 67% of the population in the northern part of the territory; and the Yoruba, who formed about 75% of the population in the southwest. Although these groups have their homelands, by the 1960s, the people were dispersed across Nigeria, with all three ethnic groups represented substantially in major cities. When the war broke out in 1967, there were still 5,000 Igbos in Lagos.

The semi-feudal and Muslim Hausa-Fulani in the north were traditionally ruled by a conservative Islamic hierarchy consisting of emirs who in turn owed their ultimate allegiance to the Sultan of Sokoto, whom they regarded as the source of all political power and religious authority. Apart from the Hausa-Fulani, the Kanuri were another dominant majority Muslim ethnic group that had key figures in the war. They made up about 5% of Nigeria&#x27;s population and were the dominant ethnic group in the north-east. They historically successfully resisted the Sokoto Caliphate during the 19th-century through their millennium-long Kanem-Bornu empire. The southernmost part of the region known as the Middle Belt had large Christian and Animist populations. Through missionary activities and the &#x27;Northernisation&#x27; policy of the Regional Government, the sub-region had a significant Eurocentric-educated population. Several key figures on the Nigerian side of the war came from this sub-region, such as Yakubu Gowon and Theophilus Danjuma, both of whom were Christians.

The Yoruba political system in the southwest, like that of the Hausa-Fulani, also consisted of a series of monarchs, the &quot;Oba&quot;s. The Yoruba monarchs, however, were less autocratic than those in the north. The political and social system of the Yoruba accordingly allowed for greater upward mobility, based on acquired rather than inherited wealth and title.

In contrast to the two other groups, Igbos in the southeast lived in autonomous, democratically organised communities. Unlike the other two regions, decisions within the Igbo communities were made by a general assembly in which men and women participated. Considering this participation by women in this civil war, the study &quot;Female fighters and the fates of rebellions: How mobilizing women influences conflict duration&quot; by Reed M. Wood observed that there was a longer duration of wars between rebel groups and the number of women that participated within the conflict at hand. In discussing the correlation between conflicts of longer duration and a high rate of participation of women, the study suggests that gender norms and the general ways in which &quot;an armed group recruits as well as who it recruits may subsequently influence its behaviors during the conflict and the manner in which the conflict unfolds.&quot;

The differing political systems and structures reflected and produced divergent customs and values. The Hausa-Fulani commoners, having contact with the political system only through a village head designated by the emir or one of his subordinates, did not view political leaders as amenable to influence. Political decisions were to be submitted to. As with many other authoritarian religious and political systems, leadership positions were given to persons willing to be subservient and loyal to superiors. A chief function of this political system in this context was to maintain conservative values, which caused many Hausa-Fulani to view economic and social innovation as subversive or sacrilegious.

In contrast to the Hausa-Fulani, the Igbos and other Biafrans often participated directly in the decisions which affected their lives. They had a lively awareness of the political system and regarded it as an instrument for achieving their personal goals. Status was acquired through the ability to arbitrate disputes that might arise in the village, and through acquiring rather than inheriting wealth. The Igbo had been substantially victimised in the Atlantic slave trade; in the year 1790, it was reported that of 20,000 people sold each year from Bonny, 16,000 were Igbo. With their emphasis upon social achievement and political participation, the Igbo adapted to and challenged colonial rule in innovative ways.

These tradition-derived differences were perpetuated and perhaps enhanced by the colonial government in Nigeria. In the north, the colonial government found it convenient to rule indirectly through the emirs, thus perpetuating rather than changing the indigenous authoritarian political system. Christian missionaries were excluded from the north, and the area thus remained virtually closed to European cultural influence. By contrast, the richest of the Igbo often sent their sons to British universities, with the intention of preparing them to work with the British. During the ensuing years, the northern emirs maintained their traditional political and religious institutions, while reinforcing their social structure. At the time of independence in 1960, the north was by far the most underdeveloped area in Nigeria. It had an English literacy rate of 2%, as compared to 19.2% in the east (literacy in Ajami, local languages in Arabic script, learned in connection with religious education, was much higher). The west also enjoyed a much higher literacy level, as it was the first part of the country to have contact with western education and established a free primary education program under the pre-independence Western Regional Government.

In the west, the missionaries rapidly introduced Western forms of education. Consequently, the Yoruba were the first group in Nigeria to adopt Western bureaucratic social norms. They made up the first classes of African civil servants, doctors, lawyers, and other technicians and professionals.

Missionaries were introduced at a later date in eastern areas because the British experienced difficulty establishing firm control over the highly autonomous communities there. However, the Igbo and other Biafran people actively embraced Western education, and they overwhelmingly came to adopt Christianity. Population pressure in the Igbo homeland, combined with aspirations for monetary wages, drove thousands of Igbos to other parts of Nigeria in search of work. By the 1960s, Igbo political culture was more unified and the region relatively prosperous, with tradesmen and literate elites active not just in the traditionally Igbo east, but throughout Nigeria. By 1966, the traditional ethnic and religious differences between northerners and the Igbo were exacerbated by new differences in education and economic class.

===Politics and economics of federalism===
The colonial administration divided Nigeria into three regions—North, West and East—something which exacerbated the already well-developed economic, political, and social differences among Nigeria&#x27;s different ethnic groups. The country was divided in such a way that the North had a slightly higher population than the other two regions combined. There were also widespread reports of fraud during Nigeria&#x27;s first census, and even today population remains a highly political issue in Nigeria. On this basis, the Northern Region was allocated a majority of the seats in the Federal Legislature established by the colonial authorities. Within each of the three regions the dominant ethnic groups, the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, respectively formed political parties that were largely regional and based on ethnic allegiances: the Northern People&#x27;s Congress (NPC) in the North; the Action Group in the West (AG); and the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC) in the East. Although these parties were not exclusively homogeneous in terms of their ethnic or regional make-up, the disintegration of Nigeria resulted largely from the fact that these parties were primarily based in one region and one tribe.

The basis of modern Nigeria formed in 1914 when the United Kingdom amalgamated the Northern and Southern protectorates. Beginning with the Northern Protectorate, the British implemented a system of indirect rule of which they exerted influence through alliances with local forces. This system worked so well, Colonial Governor Frederick Lugard successfully lobbied to extend it to the Southern Protectorate through amalgamation. In this way, a foreign and hierarchical system of governance was imposed on the Igbos. Intellectuals began to agitate for greater rights and independence. The size of this intellectual class increased significantly in the 1950s, with the massive expansion of the national education program. During the 1940s and 1950s, the Igbo and Yoruba parties were in the forefront of the campaign for independence from British rule. Northern leaders, fearful that independence would mean political and economic domination by the more Westernized elites in the South, preferred the continuation of British rule. As a condition for accepting independence, they demanded that the country continue to be divided into three regions with the North having a clear majority. Igbo and Yoruba leaders, anxious to obtain an independent country at all costs, accepted the Northern demands.

However, the two Southern regions had significant cultural and ideological differences, leading to discord between the two Southern political parties. Firstly, the AG favoured a loose confederacy of regions in the emergent Nigerian nation whereby each region would be in total control of its own distinct territory. The status of Lagos was a sore point for the AG, which did not want Lagos, a Yoruba town situated in Western Nigeria (which was at that time the federal capital and seat of national government) to be designated as the capital of Nigeria, if it meant loss of Yoruba sovereignty. The AG insisted that Lagos must be completely recognised as a Yoruba town without any loss of identity, control or autonomy by the Yoruba. Contrary to this position, the NCNC was anxious to declare Lagos, by virtue of it being the &quot;Federal Capital Territory&quot; as &quot;no man&#x27;s land&quot;—a declaration which as could be expected angered the AG, which offered to help fund the development of another territory in Nigeria as &quot;Federal Capital Territory&quot; and then threatened secession from Nigeria if it didn&#x27;t get its way. The threat of secession by the AG was tabled, documented and recorded in numerous constitutional conferences, including the constitutional conference held in London in 1954 with the demand that a right of secession be enshrined in the constitution of the emerging Nigerian nation to allow any part of the emergent nation to opt out of Nigeria, should the need arise. This proposal for inclusion of right of secession by the regions in independent Nigeria by the AG was rejected and resisted by NCNC which vehemently argued for a tightly bound united/unitary structured nation because it viewed the provision of a secession clause as detrimental to the formation of a unitary Nigerian state. In the face of sustained opposition by the NCNC delegates, later joined by the NPC and backed by threats to view maintenance of the inclusion of secession by the AG as treasonable by the British, the AG was forced to renounce its position of inclusion of the right of secession a part of the Nigerian constitution. Had such a provision been made in the Nigerian constitution, later events which led to the Nigerian/Biafran civil war may have been avoided. The pre-independence alliance between the NCNC and the NPC against the aspirations of the AG would later set the tone for political governance of independent Nigeria by the NCNC/NPC and lead to disaster in later years in Nigeria.

Northern–Southern tension manifested firstly in the 1945 Jos riots and again on 1 May 1953, as fighting in the Northern city of Kano. The political parties tended to focus on building power in their own regions, resulting in an incoherent and disunified dynamic in the federal government.

In 1946, the British divided the Southern Region into the Western Region and the Eastern Region. Each government was entitled to collect royalties from resources extracted within its area. This changed in 1956 when Shell-BP found large petroleum deposits in the Eastern region. A Commission led by Sir Jeremy Raisman and Ronald Tress determined that resource royalties would now enter a &quot;Distributable Pools Account&quot; with the money split between different parts of government (50% to region of origin, 20% to federal government, 30% to other regions). To ensure continuing influence, the British government promoted unity in the Northern bloc and secessionist sentiments among and within the two Southern regions. The Nigerian government, following independence, promoted discord in the West with the creation of a new Mid-Western Region in an area with oil potential. The new constitution of 1946 also proclaimed that &quot;The entire property in and control of all mineral oils, in, under, or upon any lands, in Nigeria, and of all rivers, streams, and watercourses throughout Nigeria, is and shall be vested in, the Crown.&quot; The United Kingdom profited significantly from a fivefold rise in Nigerian exports amidst the post-war economic boom.

==Independence and First Republic==
Nigeria gained independence on 1 October 1960, and the First Republic came to be on 1 October 1963. The first prime minister of Nigeria, Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, was a northerner and co-founder of the Northern People&#x27;s Congress. He formed an alliance with the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons party, and its popular nationalist leader Nnamdi &quot;Zik&quot; Azikiwe, who became Governor General and then President. The Yoruba-aligned Action Group, the third major party, played the opposition role.

Workers became increasingly aggrieved by low wages and bad conditions, especially when they compared their lot to the lifestyles of politicians in Lagos. Most wage earners lived in the Lagos area, and many lived in overcrowded dangerous housing. Labour activity including strikes intensified in 1963, culminating in a nationwide general strike in June 1964. Strikers disobeyed an ultimatum to return to work and at one point were dispersed by riot police. Eventually, they did win wage increases. The strike included people from all ethnic groups. Retired Brigadier General H. M. Njoku later wrote that the general strike heavily exacerbated tensions between the Army and ordinary civilians and put pressure on the Army to take action against a government which was widely perceived as corrupt.

The 1964 elections, which involved heavy campaigning all year, brought ethnic and regional divisions into focus. Resentment of politicians ran high, and many campaigners feared for their safety while touring the country. The Army was repeatedly deployed to Tiv Division, killing hundreds and arresting thousands of Tiv people agitating for self-determination.

Widespread reports of fraud tarnished the election&#x27;s legitimacy. Westerners especially resented the political domination of the Northern People&#x27;s Congress, many of whose candidates ran unopposed in the election. Violence spread throughout the country, and some began to flee the North and West, some to Dahomey. The apparent domination of the political system by the North, and the chaos breaking out across the country, motivated elements within the military to consider decisive action.

In addition to Shell-BP, the British reaped profits from mining and commerce. The British-owned United Africa Company alone controlled 41.3% of all Nigeria&#x27;s foreign trade. At 516,000 barrels per day, Nigeria had become the tenth-biggest oil exporter in the world.

Though the Nigeria Regiment had fought for the United Kingdom in both the First and Second World Wars, the army Nigeria inherited upon independence in 1960 was an internal security force designed and trained to assist the police in putting down challenges to authority rather than to fight a war. The Indian historian Pradeep Barua called the Nigerian Army in 1960 &quot;a glorified police force&quot;, and even after independence, the Nigerian military retained the role it held under the British in the 1950s. The Nigerian Army did not conduct field training, and notably lacked heavy weapons. Before 1948, Nigerians were not allowed to hold officer&#x27;s commissions, and only in 1948 were certain promising Nigerian recruits allowed to attend Sandhurst for officer training while at the same time Nigerian NCOs were allowed to become officers if they completed a course in officer training at Mons Hall or Eaton Hall in England. Despite the reforms, only an average of two Nigerians per year were awarded officers&#x27; commissions between 1948 and 1955 and only seven per year from 1955 to 1960. At the time of independence in 1960, of the 257 officers commanding the Nigeria Regiment which became the Nigerian Army, only 57 were Nigerians.

Using the &quot;martial races&quot; theory first developed under the Raj in 19th-century India, the colonial government had decided that peoples from northern Nigeria such as the Hausa, Tiv, and Kanuri were the hard &quot;martial races&quot; whose recruitment was encouraged while the peoples from southern Nigeria such as the Igbos and the Yoruba were viewed as too soft to make for good soldiers and hence their recruitment was discouraged. As a result, by 1958, men from northern Nigeria made up 62% of the Nigeria Regiment while men from the south and the west made up only 36%. In 1958, the policy was changed: henceforward men from the north would make up only 50% of the soldiers while men from the southeast and southwest were each to make up 25%. The new policy was retained after independence. The previously favoured northerners whose egos had been stoked by being told by their officers that they were the tough and hardy &quot;martial races&quot; greatly resented the change in recruitment policies, all the more as after independence in 1960 there were opportunities for Nigerian men to serve as officers that had not existed prior to independence. As men from the southeast and southwest were generally much better educated than men from the north, they were much more likely to be promoted to officers in the newly founded Nigerian Army, which provoked further resentment from the northerners. At the same time, as a part of Nigerianisation policy, it was government policy to send home the British officers who had been retained after independence by promoting as many Nigerians as possible, until by 1966 there were no more British officers. As part of the Nigerianisation policy, educational standards for officers were drastically lowered with only a high school diploma being necessary for an officer&#x27;s commission while at the same time Nigerianisation resulted in an extremely youthful officer corps, full of ambitious men who disliked the Sandhurst graduates who served in the high command as blocking further chances for promotion. A group of Igbo officers formed a conspiracy to overthrow the government, seeing the northern prime minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, as allegedly plundering the oil wealth of the southeast.

===Military coups===
On 15 January 1966, Major Chukuma Kaduna Nzeogwu, Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna, and other junior Army officers (mostly majors and captains) attempted a coup d&#x27;état. The two major political leaders of the north, the Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa and the Premier of the northern region, Sir Ahmadu Bello were killed by Major Nzeogwu. Also murdered was Bello&#x27;s wife and officers of Northern extraction. The President, Sir Nnamdi Azikiwe, an Igbo, was on an extended vacation in the West Indies. He did not return until days after the coup. There was widespread suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters had tipped him and other Igbo leaders off regarding the pending coup. In addition to the killings of the Northern political leaders, the Premier of the Western region, Ladoke Akintola and Yoruba senior military officers were also killed. This &quot;Coup of the Five Majors&quot; has been described in some quarters as Nigeria&#x27;s only revolutionary coup. This was the first coup in the short life of Nigeria&#x27;s nascent second democracy. Claims of electoral fraud were one of the reasons given by the coup plotters. Besides killing much of Nigeria&#x27;s elite, the Coup also saw much of the leadership of the Nigerian Federal Army killed with seven officers holding the rank above colonel killed. Of the seven officers killed, four were northerners, two were from the southeast and one was from the Midwest. Only one was an Igbo.

This coup was, however, not seen as a revolutionary coup by other sections of Nigerians, especially in the Northern and Western sections and by later revisionists of Nigerian coups. Some alleged, mostly from Eastern part of Nigeria, that the majors sought to spring Action Group leader Obafemi Awolowo out of jail and make him head of the new government. Their intention was to dismantle the Northern-dominated power structure but their efforts to take power were unsuccessful. Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi, an Igbo and loyalist head of the Nigerian Army, suppressed coup operations in the South and he was declared head of state on 16 January after the surrender of the majors.

In the end though, the majors were not in the position to embark on this political goal. While their 15th January coup succeeded in seizing political control in the north, it failed in the south, especially in the Lagos-Ibadan-Abeokuta military district where loyalist troops led by army commander Johnson Aguyi-Ironsi succeeded in crushing the revolt. Apart from Ifeajuna who fled the country after the collapse of their coup, the other two January Majors, and the rest of the military officers involved in the revolt, later surrendered to the loyalist High Command and were subsequently detained as a federal investigation of the event began.

Aguyi-Ironsi suspended the constitution and dissolved parliament. He abolished the regional confederated form of government and pursued unitary policies favoured by the NCNC, having apparently been influenced by NCNC political philosophy. He, however, appointed Colonel Hassan Katsina, son of Katsina emir Usman Nagogo, to govern the Northern Region, indicating some willingness to maintain cooperation with this bloc. He also preferentially released northern politicians from jail (enabling them to plan his forthcoming overthrow). Aguyi-Ironsi rejected a British offer of military support but promised to protect British interests.

Ironsi fatally did not bring the failed plotters to trial as required by then-military law and as advised by most northern and western officers, rather, coup plotters were maintained in the military on full pay, and some were even promoted while awaiting trial. The coup, despite its failures, was seen by many as primarily benefiting the Igbo peoples, as the plotters received no repercussions for their actions and no significant Igbo political leaders were affected. While those that executed the coup were mostly Northern, most of the known plotters were Igbo and the military and political leadership of Western and Northern regions had been largely bloodily eliminated while the Eastern military/political leadership was largely untouched. However, Ironsi, himself an Igbo, was thought to have made numerous attempts to please Northerners. The other events that also fuelled suspicions of a so-called &quot;Igbo conspiracy&quot; were the killing of Northern leaders, and the killing of the Brigadier-General Ademulegun&#x27;s pregnant wife by the coup executioners. Among the Igbo people, reaction to the coup was mixed.

Despite the overwhelming contradictions of the coup being executed by mostly Northern soldiers (such as John Atom Kpera, later military governor of Benue State), the killing of Igbo soldier Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Unegbe by coup executioners, and Ironsi&#x27;s termination of an Igbo-led coup, the ease by which Ironsi stopped the coup led to suspicion that the Igbo coup plotters planned all along to pave the way for Ironsi to take the reins of power in Nigeria.

Colonel Odumegwu Ojukwu became military governor of the Eastern Region at this time. On 24 May 1966, the military government issued Unification Decree #34, which would have replaced the federation with a more centralised system. The Northern bloc found this decree intolerable.

In the face of provocation from the Eastern media which repeatedly showed humiliating posters and cartoons of the slain northern politicians, on the night of 29 July 1966, northern soldiers at Abeokuta barracks mutinied, thus precipitating a counter-coup, which had already been in the planning stages. Ironsi was on a visit to Ibadan during their mutiny and there he was killed (along with his host, Adekunle Fajuyi). The counter-coup led to the installation of Lieutenant-Colonel Yakubu Gowon as Supreme Commander of the Nigerian Armed Forces. Gowon was chosen as a compromise candidate. He was a Northerner, a Christian, from a minority tribe, and had a good reputation within the army.

It seems that Gowon immediately faced not only a potential standoff with the East, but secession threats from the Northern and even the Western region. The counter-coup plotters had considered using the opportunity to withdraw from the federation themselves. Ambassadors from the United Kingdom and the United States, however, urged Gowon to maintain control over the whole country. Gowon followed this plan, repealing the Unification Decree, announcing a return to the federal system.

===Persecution of Igbo===
After the January coup, Igbos in the North were accused of taunting their hosts on the loss of their leaders. A popular example was Celestine Ukwu, a popular Igbo musician, who released a song titled &quot;Ewu Ne Ba Akwa&quot; (Goats Are Crying) apparently mocking the late Ahmadu Bello. These provocations were so pervasive that they warranted the promulgation of Decree 44 of 1966 banning them by the military government.

The first president of Nigeria Nnamdi Azikiwe who was away during the first coup noted:Some Ibo elements, who were domiciled in Northern Nigeria taunted northerners by defaming their leaders through means of records or songs or pictures. They also published pamphlets and postcards, which displayed a peculiar representation of certain northerners, living or dead, in a manner likely to provoke disaffection.From June through October 1966, pogroms in the North killed an estimated 10,000 to 30,000 Igbo, half of them children, and caused more than a million to two million to flee to the Eastern Region. 29 September 1966 became known as &#x27;Black Thursday&#x27;, as it was considered the worst day of the massacres.

Ethnomusicologist Charles Keil, who was visiting Nigeria in 1966, recounted:

The pogroms I witnessed in Makurdi, Nigeria (late Sept. 1966) were foreshadowed by months of intensive anti-Igbo and anti-Eastern conversations among Tiv, Idoma, Hausa and other Northerners resident in Makurdi, and, fitting a pattern replicated in city after city, the massacres were led by the Nigerian army. Before, during and after the slaughter, Col. Gowon could be heard over the radio issuing &#x27;guarantees of safety&#x27; to all Easterners, all citizens of Nigeria, but the intent of the soldiers, the only power that counts in Nigeria now or then, was painfully clear. After counting the disemboweled bodies along the Makurdi road I was escorted back to the city by soldiers who apologised for the stench and explained politely that they were doing me and the world a great favor by eliminating Igbos.Professor of History Murray Last, who was in Zaria city on the day after the first coup, describes his experience on that day: And the day after the coup – January 16th 1966 – there was initially so much open relief on the ABU campus that it shocked me. It was only later, when I was living within Zaria city (at Babban Dodo), that I encountered the anger at the way Igbo traders (and journalists) were mocking their Hausa fellow traders in Zaria&#x27;s Sabon Gari over the death of their &#x27;father&#x27;, and were pushing aside various motorpark workers elsewhere, telling the Hausa that the rules had now all changed and it was the Hausa who were now the underlings in market or motorpark.The Federal Military Government also laid the groundwork for the economic blockade of the Eastern Region which went into full effect in 1967.

==Breakaway==

The deluge of refugees in Eastern Nigeria created a difficult situation. Extensive negotiations took place between Ojukwu, representing Eastern Nigeria, and Gowon, representing the Nigerian Federal military government. In the Aburi Accord, finally signed at Aburi, Ghana, the parties agreed that a looser Nigerian federation would be implemented. Gowon delayed announcement of the agreement and eventually reneged.

On 27 May 1967, Gowon proclaimed the division of Nigeria into twelve states. This decree carved the Eastern Region in three parts: South Eastern State, Rivers State, and East Central State. Now the Igbos, concentrated in the East Central State, would lose control over most of the petroleum, located in the other two areas.

On 30 May 1967, Ojukwu declared independence and renamed the entire Eastern Region &#x27;the Republic of Biafra&#x27;.

The Federal Military Government immediately placed an embargo on all shipping to and from Biafra—but not on oil tankers. Biafra quickly moved to collect oil royalties from oil companies doing business within its borders. When Shell-BP acquiesced to this request at the end of June, the Federal Government extended its blockade to include oil. The blockade, which most foreign actors accepted, played a decisive role in putting Biafra at a disadvantage from the beginning of the war.

Although the very young nation had a chronic shortage of weapons to go to war, it was determined to defend itself. Although there was much sympathy in Europe and elsewhere, only five countries (Tanzania, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Zambia, and Haiti) officially recognised the new republic. The United Kingdom supplied heavy weapons and ammunition to the Nigerian side, officially to preserve the multi-ethnic country it had created but also to preserve the supply of Nigerian oil to the United Kingdom and to protect the investments of Shell-BP. The Biafra side received arms and ammunition from France, even though the French government denied sponsoring Biafra. An article in &quot;Paris Match&quot; of 20 November 1968 claimed that French arms were reaching Biafra through neighbouring countries such as Gabon. The heavy supply of weapons by the United Kingdom was the biggest factor in determining the outcome of the war.

Several peace accords were held, with the most notable one held at Aburi, Ghana (the Aburi Accord). There were different accounts of what took place in Aburi. Ojukwu accused the federal government of going back on their promises while the federal government accused Ojukwu of distortion and half-truths. Ojukwu gained agreement to a confederation for Nigeria, rather than a federation. He was warned by his advisers that Gowon did not understand the difference and would renege upon the agreement.

When this happened, Ojukwu regarded it as both a failure by Gowon to keep to the spirit of the Aburi agreement and a lack of integrity on the side of the Nigerian Military Government in the negotiations toward a united Nigeria. Gowon&#x27;s advisers, to the contrary, felt that he had enacted as much as was politically feasible in fulfilment of the spirit of Aburi. The Eastern Region was very ill-equipped for war, outmanned and outgunned by the Nigerians, but had the advantages of fighting in their homeland, support of most Easterners, determination, and use of limited resources.

The United Kingdom, which still maintained the highest level of influence over Nigeria&#x27;s highly valued oil industry through Shell-BP, and the Soviet Union supported the Nigerian government, especially by military supplies.

The Nigerian Army in 1967 was completely unready for war. The Nigerian Army had no training or experience of war on the operational level, still being primarily an internal security force. Most Nigerian officers were more concerned with their social lives than military training, spending a disproportionate amount of their time on partying, drinking, hunting and playing games. Social status in the Army was extremely important and officers devoted an excessive amount of time to ensure their uniforms were always immaculate while there was a competition to own the most expensive automobiles and homes. The killings and purges perpetuated during the two coups of 1966 had killed most of the Sandhurst graduates. By July 1966, all of the officers holding the rank above colonel had been either killed or discharged while only 5 officers holding the rank of lieutenant colonel were still alive and on duty. Almost all of the junior officers had received their commissions after 1960 and most were heavily dependent on the more experienced NCOs to provide the necessary leadership. The same problems that afflicted the Federal Army also affected the Biafran Army even more whose officer corps was based around former Federal Igbo officers. The shortage of experienced officers was a major problem for the Biafran Army, made worse by a climate of paranoia and suspicion within Biafra as Ojukwu believed that other former Federal officers were plotting against him.

==War==
Shortly after extending its blockade to include oil, the Nigerian government launched a &quot;police action&quot; to retake the secessionist territory. The war began in the early hours of 6 July 1967 when Nigerian Federal troops advanced in two columns into Biafra. The Biafra strategy had succeeded: the federal government had started the war, and the East was defending itself. The Nigerian Army offensive was through the north of Biafra led by Colonel Mohammed Shuwa and the local military units were formed as the 1st Infantry Division. The division was led mostly by northern officers. After facing unexpectedly fierce resistance and high casualties, the western Nigerian column advanced on the town of Nsukka, which fell on 14 July, while the eastern column made for Garkem, which was captured on 12 July.

===Biafran offensive===
The Biafrans responded with an offensive of their own. On 9 August, Biafran forces crossed their western border and the Niger river into the MidWestern state of Nigeria. Passing through the state capital of Benin City, the Biafrans advanced west until 21 August, when they were stopped at Ore in present-day Ondo State, east of the Nigerian capital of Lagos. The Biafran attack was led by Lt. Col. Banjo, Yoruba man, with the Biafran rank of brigadier. The attack met little resistance and the MidWestern state was easily taken over. This was due to the pre-secession arrangement that all soldiers should return to their regions to stop the spate of killings, in which Igbo soldiers had been major victims. The Nigerian soldiers who were supposed to defend the MidWestern state were mostly Igbo from that state and, while some were in touch with their Biafran counterparts, others resisted the invasion. General Gowon responded by asking Colonel Murtala Mohammed (who later became head of state in 1975) to form another division (the 2nd Infantry Division) to expel the Biafrans from the MidWestern state, to defend the border of the Western state and to attack Biafra. At the same time, Gowon declared &quot;total war&quot; and announced the Federal government would mobilise the entire population of Nigeria for the war effort. From the summer of 1967 to the spring of 1969, the Federal Army grew from a force of 7,000 to a force of 200,000 men organised in three divisions. Biafra began the war with only 230 soldiers at Enugu, which grew to two battalions by August 1967, which soon were expanded into two brigades, the 51st and 52nd which became the core of the Biafran Army. By 1969, the Biafrans were to field 90,000 soldiers formed into five undermanned divisions together with a number of independent units.

As Nigerian forces retook the MidWestern state, the Biafran military administrator declared it to be the Republic of Benin on 19 September, though it ceased to exist the next day. The present country of Benin, west of Nigeria, was still named Dahomey at that time.

Although Benin City was retaken by the Nigerians on 22 September, the Biafrans succeeded in their primary objective by tying down as many Nigerian Federal troops as they could. Gen. Gowon also launched an offensive into Biafra south from the Niger Delta to the riverine area, using the bulk of the Lagos Garrison command under Colonel Benjamin Adekunle (called the Black Scorpion) to form the 3rd Infantry Division (which was later renamed as the 3rd Marine Commando). As the war continued, the Nigerian Army recruited amongst a wider area, including the Yoruba, Itshekiri, Urhobo, Edo, Ijaw, etc.

===Nigerian offensive===
The command was divided into two brigades with three battalions each. The 1st Brigade advanced on the axis of the Ogugu–Ogunga–Nsukka road while the 2nd Brigade advanced on the axis of the Gakem–Obudu–Ogoja road. By 10 July 1967, the 1st Brigade had conquered all its assigned territories. By 12 July the 2nd brigade had captured Gakem, Ogudu, and Ogoja. To assist Nigeria, Egypt sent six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers flown by Egyptian air crews. The habit of the Egyptians to bomb Red Cross hospitals together with schools, hospitals, and marketplaces did much to earn Biafra international sympathy.

Enugu became the hub of secession and rebellion, and the Nigerian government believed that once Enugu was captured, the drive for secession would end. The plans to conquer Enugu began on 12 September 1967. On 4 October, the Nigerian 1st Division captured Enugu. Ojukwu was asleep in the Biafran State House when the federal troops attacked and narrowly escaped by disguising himself as a servant. Many Nigerians hoped that Enugu&#x27;s capture would convince the Igbos&#x27; traditional elite to end their support for secession, even if Ojukwu did not follow them. This did not occur. Ojukwu relocated his government without difficulty to Umuahia, a city positioned deep within traditional Igbo territory. The fall of Enugu contributed to a brief destabilisation of Biafran propaganda efforts, as the forced relocation of personnel left the Ministry of Information disorganised and the federal force&#x27;s success undermined previous Biafran assertions that the Nigerian state could not withstand a protracted war. On 23 October the Biafran official radio declared in a broadcast that Ojukwu promised to continue resisting the federal government, and that he attributed the loss of Enugu to subversive actions.

Nigerian soldiers under Murtala Mohammed carried out a mass killing of 700 civilians when they captured Asaba on the River Niger. The Nigerians were repulsed three times as they attempted to cross the River Niger during October, resulting in the loss of thousands of troops, dozens of tanks and equipment. The first attempt by the 2nd Infantry Division on 12 October to cross the Niger from the town of Asaba to the Biafran city of Onitsha cost the Nigerian Federal Army over 5,000 soldiers killed, wounded, captured or missing. Operation Tiger Claw (17–20 October 1967) was a military conflict between Nigerian and Biafran military forces. On 17 October 1967 Nigerians invaded Calabar led by the &quot;Black Scorpion&quot;, Benjamin Adekunle, while the Biafrans were led by Col. Ogbu Ogi, who was responsible for controlling the area between Calabar and Opobo, and Lynn Garrison, a foreign mercenary. The Biafrans came under immediate fire from the water and the air. For the next two days Biafran stations and military supplies were bombarded by the Nigerian air force. That same day Lynn Garrison reached Calabar but came under immediate fire by federal troops. By 20 October, Garrison&#x27;s forces withdrew from the battle while Col. Ogi officially surrendered to Gen. Adekunle. On 19 May 1968 Port Harcourt was captured. With the capture of Enugu, Bonny, Calabar and Port Harcourt, the outside world was left in no doubt of the Federal supremacy in the war. Biafran propaganda always blamed military defeats on &quot;saboteurs&quot; within the ranks of the Biafran officer, and both officers and the other ranks were encouraged to denounce suspected &quot;saboteurs&quot;. Throughout the war, Biafran officers were far more likely to be executed by their own side than by the Federal Army as Ojukwu conducted purges and had officers who were merely accused of being &quot;saboteurs&quot; taken out and shot. Ojukwu did not trust the majority of the former Federal Igbo officers who had rallied to Biafra and saw them as potential rivals, thus leading to murderous purges that led to most of them being executed. Furthermore, Ojukwu needed scapegoats for Biafra&#x27;s defeats and death was the usual punishment for Biafran officers who lost a battle. Out of a fear of a coup, Ojukwu created several units such as the S Brigade commanded by himself and the 4th Commando Brigade commanded by the German mercenary Rolf Steiner that existed outside of the regular chain of command. Barua wrote that Ojukwu&#x27;s leadership, especially his frequent executions of his own officers had a &quot;disastrous impact&quot; on the morale of the Biafran officer corps. The executions of officers also made it difficult for the Biafran officers to acquire the necessary experience to conduct military operations successfully as Barua noted the Biafran Army lacked both the &quot;continuity and cohesion&quot; to learn from the war.

===Control over oil production===
Oil exploration in Nigeria was pioneered by the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company in 1937. In a bid to control the oil in the eastern region, the Federal government placed a shipping embargo on the territory. This embargo did not include oil tankers. The leadership of Biafra wrote to Shell-BP demanding royalties for the oil that was being explored in their region. After much deliberation, Shell-BP decided to pay Biafra the sum of 250,000 pounds. The news of this payment reached the Federal government, which immediately extended the shipping embargo to oil tankers. The Nigerian government also made it clear to Shell-BP that it expected the company to pay all outstanding oil royalties immediately. With the stalling on the payment for Biafra, the government instructed Shell-BP to stop operations in Biafra and took over from the company.

Towards the end of July 1967, Nigerian federal troops and marines captured Bonny Island in the Niger Delta, thereby taking control of vital Shell-BP facilities. Operations began again in May 1968, when Nigeria captured Port Harcourt. Its facilities had been damaged and needed repair. Oil production and export continued, but at a lower level. The completion in 1969 of a new terminal at Forçados brought production up from 142,000 barrels/day in 1958 to 540,000 barrels/day in 1969. In 1970, this figure doubled to 1.08 million barrels/day. The royalties enabled Nigeria to buy more weapons, hire mercenaries, etc. Biafra proved unable to compete on this economic level.

==International involvement==

=== United Kingdom ===
The United Kingdom had planned to maintain and expand its supply of cheap high-quality oil from Nigeria. Therefore, it placed a high priority on maintenance of oil extraction and refining operations. The war broke out just a week before the Six-Day War in the Middle East, forcing oil tankers from the Middle East to use the long route around the Cape of Good Hope, thereby increasing the cost of Middle Eastern oil. In turn, this increased the importance of Nigerian oil to the United Kingdom, because Nigerian oil was cheaper than Persian Gulf oil. Initially, when it was unclear which side would prevail, the United Kingdom took a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach before opting decisively for Nigeria. Nigeria had a navy of only six vessels, the largest of which was a frigate; an air force of 76 planes, none of which were fighters or bombers; and an army of 7,000 men with no tanks and a shortage of officers with command experience. Though Biafra was likewise similarly weak, the two sides appeared evenly matched at the beginning of the war, and Nigerian victory was by no means considered preordained.

The United Kingdom backed the Federal Government but, when the war broke out, cautioned them not to damage British oil installations in the East. These oilworks, under the control of the Shell-BP Petroleum Development Company (jointly owned by Shell and BP), controlled 84 per cent of Nigeria&#x27;s 580,000 barrels per day. Two-thirds of this oil came from the Eastern region, and another third from the newly created Mid-West region. Two-fifths of all Nigerian oil ended up in the United Kingdom. In 1967, 30 per cent of the oil being imported into the United Kingdom came from Nigeria.

Shell-BP therefore considered carefully a request by the Federal Government that it refuse to pay the royalties demanded by Biafra. Its lawyers advised that payment to Biafra would be appropriate if this government did in fact maintain law and order in the region in question. The British government advised that paying Biafra could undermine the goodwill of the Federal Government. Shell-BP made the payment, and the government established a blockade on oil exports. Forced to choose a side, Shell-BP and the British government threw in their lot with the Federal Government in Lagos, apparently calculating that this side would be more likely to win the war. As the British High Commissioner in Lagos wrote to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs on 27 July 1967:

Ojukwu, even victorious, will not be in a strong position. He will require all the international help and recognition he can get. The Federal Government would be much better placed both internationally and internally. They would have a cast iron case for the severest treatment of a company which has subsidised a rebel, and I feel fairly convinced they would press their case to the lengths of cancelling the Company&#x27;s concessions and nationalising their installations. I conclude, therefore, if the company does change its mind and asks the British Government for advice, the best that could be given is for it to clamber hastily back on the Lagos side of the fence with cheque book at the ready.&quot;

Shell-BP took this advice. It continued to quietly support Nigeria through the rest of the war, in one case advancing a royalty of £5.5 million to fund the purchase of more British weapons.

It was not until Federal forces captured the ocean oil terminal at Bonny on 25 July 1967 that the British Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to back Nigeria with military aid. After the Federal victory at Bonny, Wilson summoned David Hunt, the British high commissioner to Nigeria, for a meeting at 10 Downing Street in early August 1967 for his assessment of the situation. Hunt&#x27;s view that the Federal forces were the better organised and would win because they could draw upon a greater population led Wilson to side with Nigeria.

During the war, the United Kingdom covertly supplied Nigeria with weapons and military intelligence and may have also helped it to hire mercenaries. After the decision was made to back Nigeria, the BBC oriented its reporting to favour this side. Supplies provided to the Federal Military Government included two vessels and 60 vehicles.

In the United Kingdom, the humanitarian campaign around Biafra began on 12 June 1968, with media coverage on ITV and in &quot;The Sun&quot;. The charities Oxfam and Save the Children Fund were soon deployed, with large sums of money at their disposal.

===France===
France provided weapons, mercenary fighters, and other assistance to Biafra and promoted its cause internationally, describing the situation as a genocide. President Charles de Gaulle referred to &quot;Biafra&#x27;s just and noble cause&quot;. However, France did not recognise Biafra diplomatically. Through Pierre Laureys, France had apparently provided two B-26s, Alouette helicopters, and pilots. France supplied Biafra with captured German and Italian weapons from World War II, sans serial numbers, delivered as part of regular shipments to Ivory Coast. France also sold Panhard armoured vehicles to the Nigerian federal government.

French involvement in the war can be viewed in the context of its geopolitical strategy (&quot;Françafrique&quot;) and competition with the British in West Africa. Nigeria represented a base of British influence in the predominantly French-aligned area. France and Portugal used nearby countries in their sphere of influence, especially Ivory Coast under President Félix Houphouët-Boigny, as waystations for shipments to Biafra. To some extent, also, France repeated its earlier policy from the Congo Crisis, when it supported the secession of the southern mining province Katanga.

Economically, France gained incentives through oil drilling contracts for the &quot;Société Anonyme Française de Recherches et d&#x27;Exploitation de Pétrolières&quot; (SAFRAP), apparently arranged with Eastern Nigeria in advance of its secession from the Nigerian Federation. SAFRAP laid claim to 7% of the Nigerian petroleum supply. In the assessment of a CIA analyst in 1970, France&#x27;s &quot;support was actually given to a handful of Biafran bourgeoisie in return for the oil. &quot; Biafra, for its part, openly appreciated its relationship with France.

France led the way, internationally, for political support of Biafra. Portugal also sent weapons. These transactions were arranged through the &quot;Biafran Historical Research Centre&quot; in Paris. French-aligned Gabon and Ivory Coast recognised Biafra in May 1968. On 8 May 1968, De Gaulle personally contributed 30,000 francs to medicine purchases for the French Red Cross mission. Fairly widespread student-worker unrest diverted the government&#x27;s attention only temporarily. The government declared an arms embargo but maintained arms shipments to Biafra under cover of humanitarian aid. In July the government redoubled its efforts to involve the public in a humanitarian approach to the conflict. Images of starving children and accusations of genocide filled French newspapers and television programs. Amidst this press blitz, on 31 July 1968, De Gaulle made an official statement in support of Biafra. Maurice Robert, head of &quot;Service de Documentation Extérieure et de Contre-Espionnage&quot; (SDECE, the French foreign intelligence service) African operations, wrote in 2004 that his agency supplied the press with details about the war and told them to use the word &quot;genocide&quot; in their reporting.

France declared &quot;Biafra Week&quot; on 11–17 March 1969, centred on a 2-franc raffle held by the French Red Cross. Soon after, de Gaulle terminated arms shipments, then resigned on 27 April 1969. Interim president Alain Poher fired General Jacques Foccart, the lead coordinator of France&#x27;s Africa policy. Georges Pompidou re-hired Foccart and resumed support for Biafra, including cooperation with the South African secret service to import more weapons.

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union strongly backed the Nigerian government, emphasising the similarity with the Congo situation. Nigeria&#x27;s need for more aircraft, which the United Kingdom and the United States refused to sell, led Gowon to accept a Soviet offer in the summer of 1967 to sell a squadron of 17 MiG-17 fighters. The British-trained Nigerian military tended to be distrustful of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet ambassador in Lagos, Alexander Romanov, a gregarious and friendly man as well as a shrewd diplomat, established an excellent rapport with Gowon and persuaded him that accepting Soviet weapons would not mean subjection to the Soviet Union. The first MiG-17s arrived in Nigeria in August 1967 together with some about 200 Soviet technicians to train the Nigerians in their use. Though the MiG-17s turned out to be too sophisticated for the Nigerians to use properly, requiring Egyptian Air Force pilots to fly them, the Soviet-Nigerian arms deal turned out to be one of the turning points of the war. Besides establishing an arms pipeline from the Soviet Union to Nigeria, the possibility that the Soviet Union would gain greater influence in Nigeria led the United Kingdom to increase its supply of arms to maintain its influence in Lagos while ruling out the possibility of either the United States or Britain recognising Biafra.

The Soviet Union consistently supplied Nigeria with weapons, with the diplomatic disclaimer that these were &quot;strictly for cash on a commercial basis&quot;. In 1968, the USSR agreed to finance the Kainji Dam on the Niger (somewhat upriver from the Delta). Soviet media outlets initially accused the British of cynically supporting the Biafran secession, then had to adjust these claims later when it turned out that the United Kingdom was, in fact, supporting the Federal Government.

One explanation for Soviet sympathy with the Federal Military Government was a shared opposition to internal secessionist movements. Before the war, the Soviets had seemed sympathetic to the Igbos. But Soviet Prime Minister Alexei Kosygin stated to their chagrin in October 1967 that &quot;the Soviet people fully understand&quot; Nigeria&#x27;s motives and its need &quot;to prevent the country from being dismembered.&quot;

Reportedly, the war substantially improved Soviet-Nigerian diplomatic and trade relations, and Moskvitch cars began to make appearances around Lagos. The USSR became a competitive importer of Nigerian cacao.

===China===
Because the Soviet Union was one of Nigeria&#x27;s leading supporters, supplying arms on a generous scale, China, having recently become rivals with the Soviets in the Sino-Soviet split, declared its support for Biafra. In its first major statement on the war in September 1968, the Xinhua Press Agency stated the People&#x27;s Republic of China fully supported the justified struggle for liberation of the people of Biafra against the Nigerian government supported by &quot;Anglo-American imperialism and Soviet revisionism&quot;. China supported arms to Biafra via Tanzania, supplying arms worth some $2 million in 1968–1969.

===Israel===
From early on, Israel perceived that Nigeria would be an important player in West African politics and saw good relations with Lagos as an important foreign policy objective. Nigeria and Israel established a linkage in 1957. In 1960, the United Kingdom allowed the creation of an Israeli diplomatic mission in Lagos, and Israel made a $10 million loan to the Nigerian government. Israel also developed a cultural relation with the Igbos based on possible shared traditions. These moves represented a significant diplomatic success given the Muslim orientation of the northern-dominated government. Some northern leaders disapproved of contact with Israel and banned Israelis from Maiduguri and Sokoto.

Israel did not begin arms sales to Nigeria until after Aguyi-Ironsi came to power on 17 January 1966. This was considered an opportune time to develop this relationship with the federal government. Ram Nirgad became Israeli ambassador to Nigeria in January. Thirty tons of mortar rounds were delivered in April.

The Eastern Region began seeking assistance from Israel in September 1966. Israel apparently turned down their requests repeatedly, although they may have put the Biafran representatives in contact with another arms dealer. In 1968, Israel began supplying the Federal Military Government with arms—about $500,000 worth, according to the US State Department. Meanwhile, as elsewhere, the situation in Biafra became publicised as a genocide. The Knesset publicly debated this issue on 17 and 22 July 1968, winning applause from the press for its sensitivity. Right-wing and left-wing political groups, and student activists, spoke for Biafra. In August 1968, the Israeli Air Force overtly sent twelve tons of food aid to a nearby site outside of Nigerian (Biafran) airspace. Covertly, Mossad provided Biafra with $100,000 (through Zurich) and attempted an arms shipment. Soon after, Israel arranged to make clandestine weapons shipments to Biafra using Ivory Coast transport planes. The nations of sub-Saharan Africa tended to support the Arabs in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute by voting for resolutions sponsored by Arab states at the United Nations. A major goal of Israeli diplomacy was to wean the African states away from the Arab states and given the way that the majority of African nations supported Nigeria, Israel was loath to antagonise them by supporting Biafra too overtly.

===Egypt===
President Gamal Abdel Nasser dispatched pilots of the Egyptian Air Force to fight for Nigeria in August 1967, flying the recently arrived MiG-17s. The tendency of Egyptian pilots to indiscriminately bomb Biafran civilians proved counterproductive in the propaganda war as the Biafrans did their best to publicise cases of civilians killed by the Egyptians. In the spring of 1969, the Nigerians replaced the Egyptian pilots with European pilots who proved to be considerably more competent.

===United States===
The civil war began while the United States was under the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson, who was officially neutral in regard to the civil war, with U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk stating that &quot;America is not in a position to take action as Nigeria is an area under British influence&quot;. Strategically, U.S. interests aligned with the Federal Military Government, although there was considerable popular public sentiment in support of Biafra. The U.S. also saw value in its alliance with Lagos, and sought to protect $800 million (in the assessment of the State Department) worth of private investment.

The neutrality was not universally popular, and a pro-Biafra lobby emerged within the United States to pressure the U.S. government to take a more active role in assisting Biafra. The American Committee to Keep Biafra Alive was an organization founded by American activists to inform the American public of the war and sway popular opinion towards Biafra. Biafra became a topic in the 1968 United States presidential election and on 9 September 1968, future Republican president Richard Nixon called for Lyndon B. Johnson to take action in helping Biafra, stating:
Until now, efforts to relieve the Biafran people have been thwarted by the desire of central government of Nigeria to pursue total and unconditional victory and by the fear of the Ibo people that surrender means wholesale atrocities and genocide. But genocide is what is taking place right now—and starvation is the grim reaper.

Both Biafran officials and the U.S. pro-Biafra lobby hoped the election of Richard Nixon would change U.S. foreign policy regarding the war. However, when Nixon became president in 1969, he found there was little he could do to change the established stance aside from calling for another round of peace talks. According to American political theorist Ernest W. Lefever, the U.S. providing official support to Biafra would have resulted in hostility from not only Nigeria, but also other African nations who supported Nigeria in the war, who had successfully argued to the United Nations that the war was an internal affair that the U.N. should not be involved with. The Vietnam War served as another obstacle to a possible U.S. intervention in Biafra. Despite this, Nixon continued to personally support Biafra.

Himself a Jew who escaped persecution from Nazi Germany, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger compared the Igbo people to Jews in a memoriam written to U.S. President Richard Nixon, stating:
Ultimately, this did not prevent Kissinger from stating that Nigerian unity was in the best interest of the west. Gulf Oil Nigeria, the third major player in Nigerian oil, was producing 9% of the oil coming out of Nigeria before the war began. Its operations were all located offshore of the federally controlled Mid-Western territory; therefore it continued to pay royalties to the federal government and its operations were mostly undisrupted.

===Canada===
At the request of the Nigerian government, Canada sent three observers to investigate allegations of genocide and war crimes against the Nigerian military. Major General W.A. Milroy was joined by two other Canadian officers in 1968, and the Canadian contingent remained until February 1970.

===Rest of Africa===
Biafra appealed unsuccessfully for support from the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), the precursor to the African Union. The OAU, bound by its charter to oppose any secession from a member state, denounced Biafra&#x27;s attempt to secede from Nigeria. Equally bound by its charter to refrain from interference in the internal affairs of its member states, the OAU took no further action. Countries such as Ethiopia and Egypt vocally supported the Nigerian government&#x27;s policies in order to prevent inspiring revolts within their own borders. However, Biafra received the support of African countries such as Tanzania, Zambia, Gabon and Ivory Coast. Rhodesian pilots smuggled weapons and money into Biafra, which Rhodesian intelligence chief Ken Flower claimed was part of the operations of Rhodesia&#x27;s Central Intelligence Organisation.

===Foreign mercenaries===
Outmatched by Nigeria&#x27;s superior firepower, Biafra hired foreign mercenaries for extra support. Mercenaries with prior experience fighting in the Congo Crisis were eagerly drawn to Biafra. German mercenary Rolf Steiner was placed in charge of the 4th Commando Brigade of the Biafran Armed Forces and commanded 3,000 men. Welsh mercenary Taffy Williams, one of Steiner&#x27;s subordinates, was in command of one hundred Biafran fighters. Steiner&#x27;s other subordinates were a mixture of adventurers consisting of the Italian Giorgio Norbiato; the Rhodesian explosive expert Johnny Erasmus; the Scotsman Alexander &quot;Alec&quot; Gay; the Irishman Louis &quot;Paddy&quot; Malrooney; the Corsican Armand Iaranelli who had been able to enlist in the Foreign Legion by pretending to be Italian; and a Jamaican bartender turned mercenary who called himself &quot;Johnny Korea&quot;. Polish-Swiss pilot Jan Zumbach formed and commanded a ragtag air force for Biafra. Canadian pilot Lynn Garrison, Swedish pilot Carl Gustaf von Rosen, and Rhodesian pilot Jack Malloch served as leaders of Biafran air operations, attacking Nigerian forces and also supplying weapons and food aid. Portuguese pilots also served in the Biafran Air Force, transporting weapons from Portugal to Biafra. Steiner established a brown water navy by converting some Chris-Craft Boats into gun boats, which turned out to be successful in launching surprise raids for weapons and supplies.

It was hoped that employing mercenaries in Nigeria would have impact similar to that experienced in the Congo, but the mercenaries proved largely ineffective since the Nigerian military received much more professional and adequate training compared to the Congolese militias. Despite some initial successes (such as Operation OAU), over half of the 4th Commando Brigade was wiped out by Nigerian forces during the disastrous Operation Hiroshima of 15–29 November 1968, resulting in Steiner experiencing depression and a nervous breakdown, leading to his eventual expulsion and replacement by Taffy Williams. Although Nigeria appeared to be a tougher opponent, commentators observing the war noted that the remaining mercenaries appeared to have developed a personal or ideological commitment to Biafra&#x27;s cause, which is a rare trait for mercenaries. Belgian mercenary Marc Goosens, who was killed by defensive Nigerian forces in a suicide mission during Operation Hiroshima, was reportedly motivated to return to Africa after a dispute with his girlfriend. Goosens was photographed in the moments before and after his death. Steiner claimed to have fought for Biafra for idealistic reasons, saying the Igbo people were the victims of genocide, but the American journalist Ted Morgan mocked his claims, describing Steiner as a militarist who simply craved war because killing was the only thing he knew how to do well. Journalist Frederick Forsyth quotes Taffy Williams speaking highly of his Biafran subordinates, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen a lot of Africans at war. But there&#x27;s nobody to touch these people. Give me 10,000 Biafrans for six months, and we&#x27;ll build an army that would be invincible on this continent. I&#x27;ve seen men die in this war who would have won the Victoria Cross in another context&quot;.

After the war, Philip Effiong, the chief of the Biafran general staff was asked by a journalist about the impact of the mercenaries on the war, his reply was: &quot;They had not helped. It would had made no difference if not a single one of them came to work for the secessionist forces. Rolf Steiner stayed the longest. He was more of a bad influence than anything else. We were happy to get rid of him.&quot;

==Biafra surrounded==

From 1968 onward, the war fell into a form of stalemate, with Nigerian forces unable to make significant advances into the remaining areas under Biafran control due to stiff resistance and major defeats in Abagana, Arochukwu, Oguta, Umuahia (Operation OAU), Onne, Ikot Ekpene, etc. But another Nigerian offensive from April to June 1968 began to close the ring around the Biafrans with further advances on the two northern fronts and the capture of Port Harcourt on 19 May 1968. The blockade of the surrounded Biafrans led to a humanitarian disaster when it emerged that there was widespread civilian hunger and starvation in the besieged Igbo areas.

The Biafran government reported that Nigeria was using hunger and genocide to win the war, and sought aid from the outside world. Private groups in the US, led by Senator Ted Kennedy, responded. No one was ever held responsible for these killings.

In September 1968, the federal army planned what Gowon described as the &quot;final offensive&quot;. Initially the final offensive was neutralised by Biafran troops by the end of the year after several Nigerian troops were routed in Biafran ambushes. In the latter stages, a Southern Federal Military Government offensive managed to break through. However, in 1969, the Biafrans launched several offensives against the Nigerians in their attempts to keep the Nigerians off-balance starting in March when the 14th Division of the Biafran army recaptured Owerri and moved towards Port Harcourt, but were halted just north of the city. In May 1969, Biafran commandos recaptured oil wells in Kwale. In July 1969, Biafran forces launched a major land offensive supported by foreign mercenary pilots continuing to fly in food, medical supplies and weapons. Most notable of the mercenaries was Swedish Count Carl Gustav von Rosen who led air attacks with five Malmö MFI-9 MiniCOIN small piston-engined aircraft, armed with rocket pods and machine guns. His Biafran Air Force consisted of three Swedes: von Rosen, Gunnar Haglund and Martin Lang. The other two pilots were Biafrans: Willy Murray-Bruce and Augustus Opke. From 22 May to 8 July 1969 von Rosen&#x27;s small force attacked Nigerian military airfields in Port Harcourt, Enugu, Benin City and Ughelli, destroying or damaging a number of Nigerian Air Force jets used to attack relief flights, including a few MiG-17&#x27;s and three of Nigeria&#x27;s six Ilyushin Il-28 bombers that were used to bomb Biafran villages and farms on a daily basis. Although the Biafran offensives of 1969 were a tactical success, the Nigerians soon recovered. The Biafran air attacks did disrupt the combat operations of the Nigerian Air Force, but only for a few months.

In response to the Nigerian government using foreigners to lead some advances, the Biafran government also began hiring foreign mercenaries to extend the war. Only German-born Rolf Steiner, a lieutenant colonel with the 4th Commandos, and Major Taffy Williams, a Welshman, would remain for the duration. Nigeria deployed foreign aircraft, in the form of Soviet MiG17 and Il28 bombers.

===Humanitarian crisis===


The September massacres and subsequent Igbo withdrawal from northern Nigeria was the basis for the initial human rights petition to the UN to end genocide and provided a historical link to Biafran claims of genocide during the Nigerian civil war. Awareness of a mounting crisis rose in 1968. Information spread especially through religious networks, beginning with alerts from missionaries. It did not escape the notice of worldwide Christian organisations that the Biafrans were Christian and the northern Nigerians controlling the federal government were Muslim. Among these Christian efforts were the organisation Joint Church Aid and Caritas, the latter aligned with various international Catholic aid groups. The famine was a result of the blockade that the Nigerian government had imposed on the Eastern region in the months leading up to secession. Frederick Forsyth, then a journalist in Nigeria and later a successful novelist, observed that the main problem was kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency. Prior to the civil war, the main source of dietary protein was dried fish imported from Norway, which was supplemented by local hogs, chicken and eggs. The blockade prevented imports, and local protein supplies were quickly depleted: &quot;The national diet was now almost 100% starch.&quot;

Many volunteer bodies organised the Biafran airlift which provided blockade-breaking relief flights into Biafra, carrying food, medicines, and sometimes (according to some claims) weapons. More common was the claim that the arms-carrying aircraft would closely shadow aid aircraft, making it more difficult to distinguish between aid aircraft and military supply aircraft.

The American Community to Keep Biafra Alive stood apart from other organisations by quickly creating a broad strategy for pressuring the American government into taking a more active role in facilitating relief. Former Peace Corps volunteers who had recently returned from Nigeria and college students founded the American Committee in July 1968. The Peace Corps volunteers stationed in the Eastern Region developed strong friendships and identified as Igbo which prompted them to help the Eastern Region.

One of the characters assisting Count Carl Gustav von Rosen was Lynn Garrison, an ex-RCAF fighter pilot. He introduced the Count to a Canadian method of dropping bagged supplies to remote areas in Canada without losing the contents. He showed how one sack of food could be placed inside a larger sack before the supply drop. When the package hit the ground the inner sack would rupture while the outer one kept the contents intact. With this method many tons of food were dropped to many Biafrans who would otherwise have died of starvation.

Bernard Kouchner was one of a number of French doctors who volunteered with the French Red Cross to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. The Red Cross required volunteers to sign an agreement, which was seen by some (like Kouchner and his supporters) as being similar to a gag order, that was designed to maintain the organisation&#x27;s neutrality, whatever the circumstances. Kouchner and the other French doctors signed this agreement.

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the Nigerian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. Kouchner also witnessed these events, particularly the huge number of starving children, and when he returned to France, he publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. With the help of other French doctors, Kouchner put Biafra in the media spotlight and called for an international response to the situation. These doctors, led by Kouchner, concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political / religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims. They formed the &quot;Comité de Lutte contre le Génocide au Biafra&quot;, which in 1971 became &quot;Médecins Sans Frontières&quot; (Doctors Without Borders).

The crisis brought about a large increase in prominence and funding of non-governmental organisations (NGOs).

===Media and public opinion===
Media and public relations played a central role in the war, due to their influence on morale at home and the dynamics of international involvement. Both sides relied heavily on external support. Biafra hired the New York public relations firm of Ruder and Finn to lobby American public opinion. However, it was not until Biafra hired the Geneva public relations Markpress in January 1968 that significant international sympathy was won. Markpress was headed by an American public relations executive, William Bernhardt, who was paid 12,000 Swiss francs per month for his services, and who expected a share of Biafra&#x27;s oil revenues after the war. Markpress&#x27;s portrayal of the war as a struggle for freedom by the Catholic Igbos against the Muslim-dominated north won the support of Catholic opinion all over the world, especially in the United States. Besides portraying the war as a Christian-Muslim conflict, Markpress accused the Federal government of waging genocide against the Igbos, a campaign that was extremely effective as pictures of starving Igbos won the sympathy of the world.

Media campaigns focused on the plight of the Biafrans intensified internationally in the summer of 1968. By the Biafran leadership and then around the world, the pogroms and famine were classified as genocide and compared to The Holocaust; hypothetical Judaic origins of the Igbos were used to bolster comparisons with Jews in Germany. In the international press, Igbo refugee camps were compared to Nazi extermination camps.

Humanitarian appeals differed somewhat from place to place. In the United Kingdom, humanitarian aid used familiar discourses of imperial responsibility; in Ireland, advertisements appealed to shared Catholicism and experiences of civil war. Both of these appeals channelled older cultural values into support for the new model of international NGOs. In Ireland, public opinion identified intensely with Biafra as most of the Catholic priests working in Biafra were Irish who naturally sympathised with the Biafrans, who they saw as fellow Catholics struggling for independence. The Irish journalist John Hogan who covered the war noted: &quot;The threat of famine, combined with an independence struggle, had an almost irresistible political and emotional impact on Irish public opinion, which became hugely supportive of the regular airlifts, via the off-shore Portuguese island of São Tomé, of food and medical supplies to the beleaguered infant republic&quot;. The use of famine as a conscious tactic by the Federal government who wanted to starve Biafra into submission provoked parallels with the Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s while many Irish people saw a parallel with Igbo struggle for independence with their own independence struggle. The pro-Biafra British journalist Frederick Forsyth started covering the war in the summer of 1967 for the BBC, became angry at the pro-Nigeria stance of the British government and resigned in protest in September 1967. Returning as a freelance journalist in 1968, Forysth worked closely with the Irish Holy Ghost Fathers to collect information about the famine, and whose dispatches from Biafra had an immense impact on British public opinion. 

In Israel, the Holocaust comparison was promoted, as was the theme of threat from hostile Muslim neighbours.

The Biafran war presented Westerners with the notion of starving African children. The Biafran famine was one of the first African disasters to receive widespread media coverage, enabled by the proliferation of television sets. The televised disaster and the rising NGOs mutually enhanced each other; NGOs maintained their own communications networks and played a significant role in shaping news coverage.

Biafran elites studied Western propaganda techniques and released carefully constructed public communications in an intentional fashion. Biafran propagandists had the dual task of appealing to international public opinion, and maintaining morale and nationalist spirit domestically. Political cartoons were a preferred medium for publicising simple interpretations of the war. Biafra also used push polling to insinuate messages about Nigeria&#x27;s inherent bloodthirstiness. Novelist Chinua Achebe became a committed propagandist for Biafra, and one of its leading international advocates.

On 29 May 1969, Bruce Mayrock, a student at Columbia University, set himself ablaze at the premises of the United Nations Headquarters in New York, to protest what he viewed as a genocide against the people of Biafra. He died of his injuries the following day. On 25 November 1969, musician John Lennon returned the MBE he had awarded by Queen Elizabeth II in 1964 in protest against British support for Nigeria. In his letter to the Queen returning the MBE, Lennon wrote: &quot;Your Majesty, I am returning this in protest against Britain&#x27;s involvement in the Nigeria-Biafra thing, against our support of America in Vietnam, and against Cold Turkey slipping down the charts. With love. John Lennon.&quot;

==Kwale oilfield incident==
In May 1969 a company of Biafran commandos raided an oil field in Kwale and killed 11 Saipem workers and Agip technicians. They captured three Europeans unhurt and then at a nearby Okpai Field Development Biafran commandos surrounded and captured 15 more expatriate personnel. The captives included 14 Italians, three West Germans and one Lebanese. It was claimed that the foreigners were captured fighting alongside Nigerians against Biafran troops and that they assisted Nigerians in constructing roads to aid them in their operations against Biafra. They were tried by a Biafran court and sentenced to death.

This incident caused an international uproar. In the month that followed Pope Paul VI, the governments of Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States of America mounted concerted pressure on Biafra. On 4 June 1969, after receiving a personal direct mail from the Pope, Ojukwu pardoned the foreigners. They were released to the special envoys sent by the governments of Ivory Coast and Gabon and left Biafra.

==End of the war==
With increased British support, the Nigerian federal forces launched their final offensive against the Biafrans once again on 23 December 1969, with a major thrust by the 3rd Marine Commando Division. The division was commanded by Col. Olusegun Obasanjo (who later became president twice), which succeeded in splitting the Biafran enclave into two by the end of the year. The final Nigerian offensive, named &quot;Operation Tail-Wind&quot;, was launched on 7 January 1970 with the 3rd Marine Commando Division attacking, and supported by the 1st Infantry division to the north and the 2nd Infantry division to the south. The Biafran towns of Owerri fell on 9 January, and Uli on 11 January. Only a few days earlier, Ojukwu fled into exile by plane to the Ivory Coast, leaving his deputy Philip Effiong to handle the details of the surrender to General Yakubu Gowon of the Federal Army on 13 January 1970. The surrender paper was signed on 14 January 1970 in Lagos and thus came the end of the civil war and renunciation of secession. Fighting ended a few days later, with the Nigerian forces advancing into the remaining Biafran-held territories, which was met with little resistance.

After the war, Gowon said, &quot;The tragic chapter of violence is just ended. We are at the dawn of national reconciliation. Once again we have an opportunity to build a new nation. My dear compatriots, we must pay homage to the fallen, to the heroes who have made the supreme sacrifice that we may be able to build a nation, great in justice, fair trade, and industry.&quot;

==Legacy==

===Atrocities against the Igbos===

The war cost the Igbos a great deal in terms of lives, money and infrastructure. It has been estimated that up to one million people may have died due to the conflict, most from hunger and disease caused by Nigerian forces. More than half a million people died from the famine imposed deliberately through blockade throughout the war. Lack of medicine also contributed. Thousands of people starved to death every day as the war progressed. The International Committee of the Red Cross in September 1968 estimated 8,000 to 10,000 deaths from starvation each day. The leader of a Nigerian peace conference delegation said in 1968 that &quot;starvation is a legitimate weapon of war and we have every intention of using it against the rebels&quot;. This stance is generally considered to reflect the policy of the Nigerian government. The federal Nigerian army is accused of further atrocities including deliberate bombing of civilians, mass slaughter with machine guns, and rape.

===Igbo nationalism===

The first generation of Igbo nationalism began to develop in the immediate aftermath of the war.

===Ethnic minorities in Biafra===
Ethnic minorities (Ibibio, Ijaw, Ogoni and others) made up approximately 40% of the Biafran population in 1966. The attitude of ethnic minorities in Biafra towards the conflict were initially divided early in the war, having suffered the same fate as Igbos in the North held the same fear and dread as Igbos. However, actions by Biafra authorities suggesting they favoured the Igbo majority turned these attitudes negative. Great suspicion was directed towards ethnic minorities and opponents of Biafra, with &#x27;combing&#x27; exercises conducted to sift these communities for saboteurs, or &#x27;sabo,&#x27; as they were commonly branded. This brand was widely feared, as it generally resulted in death by the Biafran forces or even mobs. The accusations subjected entire communities to violence in the form of killings, rapes, kidnapping and internments in camps by Biafran forces. The Biafran Organization of Freedom Fighter (BOFF) was a paramilitary organisation set up by the civil defence group with instructions to suppress the enemy, and engaged in &quot;combing&quot; exercises in minority communities.

Minorities in Biafra suffered atrocities at the hands of those fighting for both sides of the conflict. The pogroms in the north in 1966 were indiscriminately directed against people from Eastern Nigeria. Despite a seemingly natural alliance between these victims of the pogroms in the north, tensions rose as minorities, who had always harboured an interest in having their own state within the Nigerian federation, were suspected of collaborating with Federal troops to undermine Biafra. The Federal troops were equally culpable of this crime. In the Rivers area, ethnic minorities sympathetic to Biafra were killed in the hundreds by federal troops. In Calabar, some 2000 Efiks were also killed by Federal troops. Outside of the Biafra, atrocities were recorded against the residents of Asaba in present-day Delta State by both sides of the conflict.

===Genocide question===
Legal scholar Herbert Ekwe-Ekwe and other academics argued that the Biafran war was a genocide, for which no perpetrators have been held accountable. Critics of this position acknowledge that starvation policies were pursued deliberately and that accountability has not been sought for the 1966 pogroms, but suggest that claims of genocide are incongruous with the fact that the Igbo were not exterminated after the war ended, alongside other arguments such as a lack of clarity surrounding Nigerian intentions and that Nigeria was fighting to retain control of Biafra and its people rather than to expel or exterminate them. Biafra made a formal complaint of genocide against Igbos to the International Committee on the Investigation of Crimes of Genocide, a Paris-based NGO of international lawyers, which concluded that the actions undertaken by the Nigerian government against the Igbo amounted to a genocide. With special reference to the Asaba Massacre, jurist Emma Okocha described the killings as &quot;the first black-on-black genocide&quot;. Ekwe-Ekwe places significant blame on the British government for their support of the Nigerian government, which he argued allowed for their depredations against the Igbo to continue.

===Reconstruction===
Accusations were made of Nigerian government officials diverting resources meant for reconstruction in the former Biafran areas to their ethnic areas. Military government continued in power in Nigeria for many years, and people in the oil-producing areas claimed they were being denied a fair share of oil revenues. Laws were passed mandating that political parties could not be ethnically or tribally based; however, it has been hard to make this work in practice.

Igbos who ran for their lives during the pogroms and war returned to find their positions had been taken over; and when the war was over the government did not feel any need to re-instate them, preferring to regard them as having resigned. This reasoning was also extended to Igbo-owned properties and houses. People from other regions were quick to take over any house owned by an Igbo, especially in the Port Harcourt area. The Nigerian Government justified this by terming such properties abandoned. This, however, has led to a feeling of an injustice as the Nigerian government policies were seen as further economically disabling the Igbos even long after the war. Further feelings of injustice were caused by Nigeria changing its currency, so that Biafran supplies of pre-war Nigerian currency were no longer honoured. At the end of the war, only N£20 was given to any easterner regardless of the amount of money he or she had had in the bank. This was applied irrespective of their banking in pre-war Nigerian currency or Biafran currency. This was seen as a deliberate policy to hold back the Igbo middle class, leaving them with little wealth to expand their business interests.

===Fall of Biafra and restoration attempts===

On 29 May 2000, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that President Olusegun Obasanjo commuted to retirement the dismissal of all military persons who fought for the breakaway state of Biafra during the Nigerian civil war. In a national broadcast, he said that the decision was based on the principle that &quot;justice must at all times be tempered with mercy.&quot;

Biafra was more or less wiped off the map until its resurrection by the contemporary Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra. Chinua Achebe&#x27;s last book, &quot;There Was a Country: A Personal History of Biafra&quot;, has also rekindled discussion of the war. In 2012, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) separatist movement was founded, led by Nnamdi Kanu. In 2021, tensions between IPOB and the Nigerian government escalated into the violent Orlu Crisis, with IPOB declaring that the &quot;second Nigeria/Biafra war&quot; had begun. The separatists vowed that this time, Biafra would win.

=== South East Freedom Fight ===
Nnamdi Kanu&#x27;s ascent to prominence and the meteoric rise of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is a complex narrative deeply intertwined with the socio-political fabric of Nigeria. Kanu, a charismatic and outspoken leader, gained attention through his vocal advocacy for the rights of the Igbo people and the call for an independent state of Biafra in southeastern Nigeria. His platform, IPOB, emerged as a formidable force, rallying support both within Nigeria and among the Igbo diaspora globally. The movement tapped into deep-seated grievances stemming from historical injustices, marginalization, and perceived neglect of the Igbo ethnic group within the Nigerian state. Kanu&#x27;s ability to leverage social media and online platforms amplified his message, resonating with a significant segment of the Igbo population disillusioned with the Nigerian government. Despite facing legal challenges and government crackdowns, Kanu&#x27;s influence continued to grow, symbolizing a resurgence of Biafran identity and aspirations for self-determination within Nigeria&#x27;s complex political landscape.

=== Intergenerational impacts ===
According to a 2021 study, &quot;War exposure among women [in the Biafran war] results in reduced adult stature, an increased likelihood of being overweight, earlier age at first birth, and lower educational attainment. War exposure of mothers has adverse impacts on next-generation child survival, growth, and education. Impacts vary with age of exposure.&quot;

<text>The Cowboy Artists of America (CAA) is an exclusive organization of artists that was founded in 1965. It was founded in 1965 by four prominent western artists, Joe Beeler, Charlie Dye, John Hampton and George Phippen, who have all since died. Since its inception, the exclusive organization of artists has always been dedicated to portraying the lifestyles of the cowboy and the American West, both as it was and as it endures. The CAA was founded in 1965 in Sedona, Arizona and held its first art show in 1966 at the Cowboy Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. In 1973, the annual event moved to the Phoenix Art Museum. In April 2011, the museum announced that it would no longer host the event.

In 2015, the CAA&#x27;s 50th anniversary exhibition was to be held at the Scottsdale Museum of the West in Scottsdale, Arizona.

The artists&#x27; works, highly sought after by western collectors, often fetch high prices. As an example, Howard Terpning&#x27;s &quot;Cooling Off the Hard Way&quot; sold for $305,000 at the 2003 Santa Fe Art Auction.

==Members==
As of 2015, the CAA had cumulatively had 77 artists as members. Notable members have included:
*Joe Beeler (1931-2006)
* Harley Brown
*Charlie Dye
*Phil Epp

*George Phippen
*Tom Ryan

<doc id="632188" wikidata="Q1357081" url="?curid=632188" title="Ted Neeley">
<text>Teddie Joe Neeley (born September 20, 1943) is an American singer, actor, musician, composer, and record producer. He is known for portraying the title role in the 1973 film adaptation of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, for which he was nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and has reprised numerous times.

Neeley considers himself a baritone, and is known for his extremely wide vocal range and rock screams—notably the G above high C (G5) in &quot;Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)&quot; from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Neeley was born in Ranger, Texas. He signed his first record deal in 1965, at age 22, with Capitol Records. He and his group, The Teddy Neeley Five, recorded an album titled &quot;Teddy Neeley&quot;. They played the club circuit for years, and their name (on a marquee) appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Dragnet 1967&quot;. In 1968, Neeley starred in the Los Angeles productions of Larry Norman&#x27;s rock musicals &quot;Alison&quot; and &quot;Birthday for Shakespeare&quot;, with Norman and Richard Hatch. Then, in 1969, Neeley played the lead role of Claude in both the New York and Los Angeles productions of &quot;Hair&quot;. He also appeared on the controversial, unaired episode of &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; that prompted CBS to cancel the series.

==Jesus Christ Superstar==
Neeley&#x27;s work with Tom O&#x27;Horgan, the director of &quot;Hair&quot;, led to him being called when O&#x27;Horgan was hired to stage &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; for Broadway in 1971. Neeley originally auditioned for the role of Judas, seeing it as a great opportunity to play a character few understand.

However, when Ben Vereen was chosen for the role, Neeley signed on as chorus and also became the understudy for Jesus Christ. This particular opportunity led to his taking on the title role in the Los Angeles stage version (which played at the Universal Amphitheatre in 1972), after receiving a standing ovation during a performance earlier in the tour. Castmate and close friend Carl Anderson was touring also as an understudy for Judas.

After performing the title role in the stage production of &quot;Tommy&quot; at the Aquarius Theatre in Hollywood in 1973, Neeley was led to reprise the title role in the film version of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, directed by Norman Jewison, alongside Anderson as Judas. In 1974, he received nominations for his performance in the film at the 31st Golden Globe Awards for &quot;Best Actor in a Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy&quot; and &quot;New Star Of The Year—Actor&quot;.

==Post-JCS: music, television, and theatre==

In 1974, fresh from the success of &quot;Superstar&quot;, Neeley released a solo album, &quot;1974 A.D.&quot; (1974), and played the role of Billy Shears in The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road&quot; in New York. From then on, he was a frequent musical guest star on network variety programs such as &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot;, &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; [as lead singer in The Teddy Neeley Five], &quot;Sonny and Cher&quot; and &quot;A Touch of Gold&quot;, and as a guest actor in films such as &quot;The Shadow of Chikara&quot; (1977) and &quot;Hard Country&quot; (1981), network dramas during the 1970s and 1980s, such as &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot;.

The specter of &quot;Superstar&quot; continued to loom large over Neeley&#x27;s career. In the late 1970s, he reprised his performance in the title role for two regional productions in California, both under the auspices of the California Youth Theatre organization. The first reunited him with his Broadway and film co-stars Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman (as Judas and Mary Magdalene).

Among his other credits, Neeley composed music for and appeared in Director Robert Altman&#x27;s film &quot;A Perfect Couple&quot; (1979) and performed the music for the TriStar feature film &quot;Blame It on the Night&quot;, NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot;, and &quot;The Big Blue Marble&quot; for the Children&#x27;s Television Network. He also wrote music for and starred in &quot;Cowboy Jack Street&quot;, at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles.

At the same time, Neeley provided his abilities as singer, songwriter, vocal arranger, and producer to albums and to appearances by such artists as Nigel Olsson, Tina Turner, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams, Disco Tex and the Sex-O-Lettes, Ray Charles, Richie Havens, The Kinks, Ben Vereen, Bo Diddley, Keith Carradine, and Meat Loaf.

He worked with songwriter Michael Rapp, who wrote such hit concept albums as &quot;Ulysses: The Greek Suite&quot;, &quot;The Ring&quot; and &quot;The Enchanter&quot; exclusively for showcasing Neeley&#x27;s vocal talents. In the late 1970s, he returned to live performance, now with his band, Pacific Coast Highway.

==Return to the stage==

Twenty years after first playing the role, Neeley gained renewed success in reprising the lead role of Jesus in the 1990s touring company of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, with Carl Anderson also once again co-starring as Judas. Other notable leads included Stevie Wonder&#x27;s former wife Syreeta and Irene Cara of &quot;Fame&quot; as Mary, and Dennis DeYoung of Styx as Pilate. Originally planned as a three-month tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the motion picture, the &quot;A.D. Tour&quot; went on to become the longest running revival in North American theater history. From 1992 to 1997, the successful tour enabled Neeley the opportunity to reprise his role over 1,700 times.

In 1999, Neeley reunited with Michael Rapp for a new project, a rock musical entitled &quot;Rasputin&quot;, a story about the fall of the Romanov dynasty as seen through the eyes of Alexei, heir to the throne and friend to the &quot;mad monk&quot; (a role played by Neeley).

In addition to playing the title role, he produced a one-night showcase production (in 1999) and concept album (released in 2002) of the show. He followed this up in 2000 by performing the role of Willie Moore in the world premiere of &quot;Murder in the First&quot;, presented by the Rubicon Theatre Company of California. That same year he served as the sound consultant for their production of the Harry Chapin revue &quot;Lies and Legends&quot;.

In 2004, Neeley worked with RTC once again, appearing as Lucky in the Rubicon Theatre Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, which was the centerpiece of their BeckettFest.

In August 2006, Neeley was asked to perform the title role in &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; live in concert for a one-night-only benefit at the Ricardo Montalbán Theatre in Hollywood, California. Produced and directed by Gary Goddard, this production reunited him with several of his former co-stars from the original Broadway cast and 1973 film (Ben Vereen, Yvonne Elliman, Barry Dennen) and also paired him with current celebrities (Jack Black as Herod and Clint Holmes as Simon).

Immediately following the Superstar Benefit in Hollywood, Neeley began headlining another production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;. It was originally billed by some as his national &quot;farewell&quot; tour, but Neeley disavowed the claim and the tour became known as the new &quot;A.D. Tour&quot;.

The tour was supposed to last through 2007, but it was extended into 2010. Carl Anderson, who was originally slated to reprise his role as Judas, died in 2004 of leukemia. Corey Glover, lead singer of the rock band Living Colour, co-starred as Judas early in the tour. Glover left the show to rejoin Living Colour in June 2008, and actor James Delisco took over the Judas role, along with several new cast members for the third (2009) leg of the tour.

On the fourth and final leg (2009–2010), Judas was played by John Twiford. Several other cast members returned for the fourth leg including Darrel R. Whitney (Caiaphas) and Matthew G. Myers (Simon/Judas Understudy). The tour ended in Boston, Massachusetts, on May 9, 2010.

==Current projects: film, stage, and music==
In 2012, following successful stage tours, film and television work, Neeley continued his childhood dream of singing in a rock and roll band. He hit the road with &quot;The Little Big Band&quot; and the first stop was a benefit concert for the performing arts program at the high school in Virginia where Carl Anderson began his career. Neeley had a cameo role as a slave tracker in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2012 Academy Award-winning film &quot;Django Unchained.&quot; While on location in the swamps of Louisiana, Neeley was inspired for the &quot;Tracker&#x27;s Chant&quot; which was included in the soundtrack for the film. In 2013, Neeley went back into the recording studio to record his album &quot;Workin&#x27; for the Words&quot;. A digitally re-mastered production of his &quot;1974 A.D.&quot; original vinyl album, distributed as a CD called &quot;Ted Neeley 1974 A.D. / 2013 A.D.&quot; was later released.

Later in 2013, in celebration of the 40th Anniversary of the film &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, Neeley toured the US screening the digitally re-mastered DCP print of the film. The screening events included a pre-screening audience Q&amp;A and post-film meet and greet with appearances by the principal cast members including Barry Dennen (Pontius Pilate), Yvonne Elliman (Mary Magdalene) and Larry Marshall.

Neeley&#x27;s EP &quot;Rock Opera&quot; was released in April 2014. &quot;Rock Opera&quot; includes songs from &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and &quot;Tommy&quot;, along with vocal collaborations with friends and &quot;Superstar&quot; co-stars, including Yvonne Elliman in their duet &quot;Up Where We Belong&quot;, and with the late Carl Anderson, featured in the re-imagined &quot;God&#x27;s Gift To The World&quot;. The EP also includes a live on-stage performance of &quot;Gethsemane&quot;. Produced by Frank Munoz (Ace Frehley&#x27;s &quot;Anomaly&quot;, Jason Newsted&#x27;s &quot;Metal&quot;), &quot;Rock Opera&quot; was available on iTunes and his web site.

In the spring of 2014, Neeley was invited to Rome to perform as Jesus in the Peep Arrow Production of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot;, directed by Massimo Romeo Piparo. The show also featured Italian rock band Negrita on stage during the performances along with a 12-piece orchestra. The show ran for a few months in Rome and it went on to tour in Italy through May 2015. In the summer of 2014, Neeley played the role of &quot;The Publicist&quot; in Darren Lynn Bousman and Terrance Zdunich&#x27;s film &quot;Alleluia! The Devil&#x27;s Carnival&quot;. The film had its world premiere in Hollywood at the Egyptian Theatre on August 11, 2015.

<text>Ruffian (April 17, 1972 – July 7, 1975) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who won ten consecutive races, including the Acorn, Mother Goose and Coaching Club American Oaks, then known as the American Triple Tiara. She was in the lead at every point of call in every race she ever ran and set new stakes records in each of the eight stakes races she won. Her dominating wins caused her to be named the American Champion filly at both ages two and three. In July 1975, she entered a highly anticipated match race with Kentucky Derby winner Foolish Pleasure, in which she broke down. Surgery was attempted but Ruffian reacted poorly and exacerbated the injuries while coming out of anesthesia. As a result, she was euthanized.

Ruffian was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1976. &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine ranked her as the top filly or mare of the twentieth century in their list of the top 100 American racehorses of the 20th century, and number 35 overall. Her story was told in the 2007 film &quot;Ruffian&quot; and numerous books.

==Background ==
Ruffian was foaled on April 17, 1972, at Claiborne Farm near Paris, Kentucky. She was bred by Stuart S. Janney Jr. and Barbara Phipps Janney, owners of Locust Hill Farm in Glyndon, Maryland. Janney, a cousin of prominent horseman Ogden Mills Phipps, later became the chairman of the Bessemer Trust. Ruffian was sired by Reviewer, a son of the Phipps family&#x27;s great sire Bold Ruler, and out of the Native Dancer mare Shenanigans. She was trained by Frank Y. Whiteley Jr.

Ruffian was a dark bay filly, often described as black or near-black. She stood high, then considered quite large for a filly. Sportswriter Joe Hirsch called her the most imposing juvenile filly he&#x27;d ever seen. William Nack, author of &quot;Ruffian: A Racetrack Romance&quot;, wrote, &quot;She looked like an outside linebacker.&quot; Ruffian used her early speed, size and strength to intimidate competition.

==Racing career==

===Two-year-old season===

Ruffian made her debut at Belmont Park on May 22, 1974, in a -furlong maiden special weight race, going off at odds of 4–1 in a field of ten. Breaking from post position nine, she went straight to the front while running the first quarter-mile in 22 seconds. She continued to open up her lead while rounding the turn, completing the half-mile in 45 seconds flat. She eventually won by 15 lengths and tied the track record in a time of 1:03 flat.

On June 12, Ruffian faced stiffer company in the -furlong Fashion Stakes, including two other undefeated fillies, Copernica and Jan Verzel. Despite the step up in class, Ruffian went off as the 2-5 favorite based on her earlier win. She again went to the lead with an opening quarter of 22 seconds with Copernica lengths back. The margin remained the same through the half mile, run in 0:45, but Ruffian started to open up in the stretch. The final margin was lengths to Copernica, with Jan Verzel a further 13 lengths back in third. Ruffian equaled her own track record of 1:03.

Ruffian made her third start on July 10 at Aqueduct Racetrack in the Astoria Stakes over a distance of furlongs. Facing only three rivals, she went off as the 1-10 favorite with no show betting allowed. She established an early lead while running the first quarter in 0:21. Despite being eased in the final strides, she won by nine lengths in a time of 1:02, setting a new stakes record. She was just one-fifth of a second off the track record set by Raise A Native.

Her next start at Monmouth Park on July 27 in the Grade I Sorority Stakes would prove a greater challenge as she faced another top class filly called Hot n Nasty, who like Ruffian had already earned multiple stakes wins. Ruffian went off as the 3-10 favorite with Hot n Nasty at 2–1. Ruffian broke a step slow but soon took the early lead, setting a &quot;brutally fast&quot; pace of 0:21 for the first quarter and 0:44 for the half. Hot n Nasty stayed in touch though and actually got a head in front near the top of the stretch. For the first time, jockey Jacinto Vásquez hit Ruffian with the whip. Ruffian responded by inching back into the lead, then finally drew away to win in a stakes record time of 1:09 for six furlongs. Hot n Nasty was lengths back in second and the third place horse was 22 lengths behind.

The day after the race, Ruffian came down with a heavy cough. Vásquez also believed she had popped a splint in the race, which, although not a serious injury, was painful enough to take the edge off of most horses.

On August 23 at Saratoga Race Course, Ruffian entered the Spinaway Stakes at a distance of six furlongs. Going off at odds of 1–5 in a field of four, she was never challenged in a gate-to-wire win of lengths. Her time of 1:08 broke the stakes record that had been set at Belmont Park in 1945 on the old Widener straight course. Secretariat&#x27;s trainer, Lucien Laurin, said, &quot;As God is my judgment, this filly may be better than Secretariat!&quot; Another trainer said that she could have won either division of that year&#x27;s Hopeful Stakes, Saratoga&#x27;s most prestigious race for colts, by twenty lengths. It was the fastest time ever run by a two-year-old, colt or filly, at Saratoga.

Ruffian was entered in the Frizette Stakes on September 26 but was scratched on the day of the race due to a high temperature. Whitely then considered running her against colts in the Champagne Stakes but she went off her feed and ran another fever. Veterinarian James Prendergast detected a hairline fracture of her right hind ankle, ruling her out for the rest of the year. Whiteley was later interviewed about the fracture and asked if it were true that it happened during the Spinaway. He answered, &quot;It did happen during the race, she was just a couple of strides from the wire.&quot; When asked why he thought Ruffian had not shown any signs of being hurt until later, he replied, &quot;She is a very tough filly, and doesn&#x27;t like to show any weaknesses.&quot;

Ruffian missed the rest of the two-year-old season but her five wins were sufficient to earn her the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Filly. Ruffian was also voted the 2-year-old &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; by &quot;Turf &amp; Sport Digest&quot; as well as the 1974 &quot;Filly 2 year old Champion&quot; [Reference: &quot;Turf &amp; Sport Digest&quot; January 1975. Front Cover and full article page 24,25,26.]

===Three-year-old season===
Ruffian started her three-year-old campaign on April 14 in a six-furlong allowance race at Aqueduct. Despite the long layoff, she was the prohibitive 1-10 favorite in a field of five. She took the lead after a few strides, then ran the opening quarter-mile in 23 seconds flat and the half in 0:45. She won by lengths in a time of 1:09

She followed up with a victory in the Comely Stakes at Aqueduct on April 30, winning despite a poor start by lengths. Her time of 1:21 for 7 furlongs set a new stakes record and was just a second off Dr. Fager&#x27;s track record. Going off at odds of 1-20 (the legal minimum), she created a minus pool of $36,064.

Ruffian was then targeted at the so-called Triple Tiara, the filly equivalent of the American Triple Crown. At the time, the series consisted of the Acorn Stakes, Mother Goose Stakes and Coaching Club American Oaks. In the Acorn Stakes on May 10 at Aqueduct, Ruffian was the 1-10 favorite. She was expected to face eight other fillies, but her two main rivals scratched before the race. Ruffian quickly went to the lead and won by lengths in a stakes record time of 1:34 for one mile. &quot;What can you say?&quot; asked Vásquez. &quot;She&#x27;s just great and runs so easy. She had no competition.&quot;

On May 31, Ruffian entered the Mother Goose Stakes at Aqueduct as the 1-10 favorite in a field of seven. The start was marred when the filly to Ruffian&#x27;s right, Dan&#x27;s Commander, threw her rider. Ruffian was not disturbed and took the lead, running the first quarter-mile in a relatively slow 0:24. Running at her own pace, she completed the half in 0:47 while leading by lengths then completed three-quarters in 1:11 with a two-length lead. Turning into the stretch, she started to draw away and eventually won by lengths while setting a new stakes record of 1:47 for nine furlongs. &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything but ride&quot;, said Vásquez.

In the Coaching Club American Oaks on June 21 at Belmont Park, she was again made the 1-10 favorite despite racing for the first time at a distance of miles. She opened up a 6 length lead on the backstretch but the field closed on her during the far turn, getting as close as 1 length. In the stretch, Ruffian again pulled away to win by lengths over Equal Change, with the third place horse a further nine lengths back. Her time of 2:27 tied the stakes record.

Ruffian was undefeated in her first ten races, covering distances from to , with an average winning margin of 8 lengths. She set stakes records in each stakes race she entered.

==== Final race and death ====
Ruffian&#x27;s eleventh race was run at Belmont Park on July 6, 1975. It was a match race between her and that year&#x27;s Kentucky Derby winner, Foolish Pleasure. Her connections had been asked about running her against colts since early in her career, and Whiteley thought that the Travers Stakes at Saratoga in August would be a good opportunity. &quot;Prove the point one time and that&#x27;ll be it,&quot; he had said in May. &quot;I don&#x27;t want to put too much pressure on her.&quot; However, Janney felt obligated to enter in the July match race due to media and public expectations. He told Whiteley that such a race was inevitable and it would be best to do so on her home track. In the past, the horses had shared the same jockey: Jacinto Vásquez. Vásquez chose to ride Ruffian in the match race, believing her to be the better of the horses; Braulio Baeza rode Foolish Pleasure. The &quot;Great Match&quot; was heavily anticipated and attended by more than 50,000 spectators, with an estimated television audience of 20 million.

As Ruffian left the starting gate, she hit her shoulder hard before straightening herself. The first quarter-mile (402 m) was run in 22 seconds, with Ruffian ahead by a nose. Little more than later, Ruffian was in front by half a length when she changed leads, followed by a crack audible to both jockeys. Both of the sesamoid bones in her right foreleg had snapped. Vasquez tried to pull her up, but the filly would not stop. She went on running, pulverizing her sesamoids, ripping the skin of her fetlock and tearing her ligaments until her hoof was flopping uselessly. Vasquez said it was impossible for him to stop her. She still tried to run and finish the race. Video showed Ruffian was startled by a bird in the infield and took a bad step.

Ruffian was immediately attended to by a team of four veterinarians and an orthopedic surgeon, and underwent an emergency operation lasting twelve hours, during which she had to be revived twice after she stopped breathing. When the anesthesia wore off after the surgery, she thrashed about wildly on the floor of a padded recovery stall as if still running in the race. Despite the efforts of numerous attendants, she began spinning in circles on the floor. As she flailed about with her legs, she repeatedly knocked the heavy plaster cast against her own elbow until the elbow, too, was smashed to bits. The vet who treated her said that her elbow was shattered and looked like a piece of ice after being smashed on the ground. The cast slipped, and as it became dislodged it ripped open her foreleg all over again, undoing the surgery. The medical team, knowing that Ruffian would probably not survive more extensive surgery for the repair of her leg and elbow (much less the long period of stall rest required after surgery), euthanized her shortly afterward at 2:25 a.m. on July 7.

&quot;It was unfortunate we were in a learning period at the time&quot;, said her surgeon Dr. Edward Keefer in 2000. &quot;Vets are really doing a hell of a job now and have improved tremendously in their knowledge and how to handle these catastrophic occurrences.&quot;

====Burial====
At around 9p.m. on July 7, 1975, after the day&#x27;s races concluded at Belmont Park, Ruffian&#x27;s remains were buried in a private ceremony in the infield. Her nose was pointed towards the finish line.

In August 2023 it was announced that Ruffian&#x27;s remains were exhumed from her grave at Belmont Park and reinterred in Marchmont Cemetery at Claiborne Farm in Kentucky where she was born. The decision was made by Stuart Janney III (the son of Ruffian&#x27;s owner) after consultation with the New York Racing Association and Claiborne, as Ruffian&#x27;s grave was located directly on the footprint of where Belmont was in the process of constructing a one-mile synthetic racetrack. Janney expressed hope that more members of the public would be able to pay their respects to Ruffian in her new resting place.

==Aftermath==

Ruffian&#x27;s breakdown and death led to a public outcry for more humane treatment of racehorses. As it is natural for horses to thrash and kick when coming out of anesthesia, a &quot;recovery pool&quot; was developed so that they awaken suspended in warm water and don&#x27;t re-injure themselves. Medications such as corticosteroids for inflammation and pain management came into common use. However, while helping the horses in the short term, the increased use of medications at the track had a disadvantage, as many more horses were raced while injured. The average number of starts per year steadily declined, though this may also be attributable to economic factors.

Ruffian&#x27;s breeding may be considered at least partly to blame for her broken leg; her sire, Reviewer, suffered three breakdowns in his racing career. After his fourth and last breakdown, which occurred while in his paddock, he had to be euthanized after surgery. Shenanigans, Ruffian&#x27;s dam, was euthanized following intestinal surgery on May 21, 1977, when she broke two legs while recovering from anesthetic. Ruffian&#x27;s damsire, Native Dancer, is considered by some to be the purveyor of &quot;soft boned&quot; genetics, primarily through his brilliant but unsound son Raise a Native. Inbreeding to Raise a Native may have been a factor in the later breakdown of Eight Belles.

Later research by Susan Stover showed that catastrophic breakdowns were most often preceded by smaller stress fractures, though the fracture Ruffian experienced as a two-year-old was in a different leg. To help prevent similar tragedies, the industry has directed research into improved early detection, surgical techniques and rehabilitation methods.

==Legacy==

Ruffian posthumously earned the 1975 Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Filly. In 1976, she was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine ranked her 35th in its list of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century; she is the highest-rated filly (or mare) on the list. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; included her as the only non-human on their list of the top 100 female athletes of the century, ranking her 53rd.

In the summer of 1975, folk singer Joan Baez dedicated a version of the song &quot;Stewball&quot; to Ruffian.

Since 1976, the Ruffian Handicap has been run in Ruffian&#x27;s honor. Until 2009, the race had been held at Belmont Park (on Long Island, New York), but it was moved upstate to Saratoga Race Course in 2010. In 2014, the Ruffian Handicap was moved back to Belmont Park.

The Ruffian Equine Medical Center, now known as Cornell Ruffian Equine Specialists, opened on May 26, 2009. It cost $18 million to build and is located outside Gate 8 of Belmont Park. The facility offers a wide range of services ranging from acute care for race related injuries to preventative care and farrier consultations.

Ruffian has many nicknames, such as &quot;Queen of the Fillies&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Century&quot;, &quot;Queen of Racing&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Track&quot;, &quot;Filly of the Century&quot;, &quot;The Super Filly&quot;, the &quot;Black Terror&quot; and more. Several books about her have been published, including &quot;Ruffian, Burning from the Start&quot;, &quot;Ruffian, A Racetrack Romance&quot;, &quot;Ruffian: Horse Racing&#x27;s Black Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Licorice Daughter, My Year with Ruffian&quot;.

In Lexington, Kentucky, the road into the Masterson Station Park is named &quot;Ruffian Way&quot; and a monument in her honor can be found inside the park. It reads, &quot;This memorial erected in memory of Ruffian, dark bay thoroughbred filly. We were young when she died, too young to remember her with the greats of other eras. Yet to love grace and perfection is ours because we are human and none felt her loss more painfully than we. The Children of Lexington – 1975&quot;

In Japan, the horse owner club is named after the horse, as the founder, , is said to have met the horse when he was training in the United States.

==Breeding==
Ruffian was by Reviewer, a talented racehorse who was injured in each of the three seasons he raced. In a short career at stud, he sired two outstanding fillies, Ruffian and Revidere, but failed to sire a son capable of continuing his line.

Ruffian&#x27;s dam Shenanigans earned three wins in 22 starts for the Janneys, then became an outstanding broodmare. In addition to Ruffian, Shenanigans produced graded stakes winner and important sire Icecapade, the talented filly Laughter, who went on to become a producer of several stakes winners, and Buckfinder, another stakes winner and good sire. Shenanigans was named the 1975 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year.

<text>The brown-capped babbler (Pellorneum fuscocapillus) is a member of the family Pellorneidae.

==Distribution==
The brown-capped babbler is an endemic resident breeding bird in Sri Lanka. Its habitat is forest undergrowth and thick scrub. This species, like most babblers, is not migratory, and has short rounded wings and a weak flight.

==Ecology==
This babbler builds its nest on the ground or in a hole, concealed in dense masses of foliage. The normal clutch is two or three eggs.

==Description==

The brown-capped babbler is a smallish to medium-sized babbler, at including its long tail. It is brown above and rich cinnamon below. It has a dark brown crown.

Brown-capped babblers have short dark bills. Their food is mainly insects. They can be difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer, but like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and their characteristic calls are often the best indication that these birds are present.

==Behavior==
Brown-capped babblers are usually believed to occur in pairs. Male birds make a distinctive call (&quot;pretty dear&quot;) to attract other birds. Breeding season occurs during the first half of the year, during which time males exhibit territorial behavior.

==In culture==

In Sri Lanka, this bird is known as &quot;parandel-kurulla&quot; (translates to &#x27;dried-grass(colored) bird&#x27;) or &quot;redi diang&quot; (onomatopoeic in origin) in Sinhala language. Brown-capped babbler appears in a 4 rupee Sri Lankan postal stamp,

==Subspecies==
Three subspecies found.
*&quot;P. f. babaulti&quot; - low country dry zone
*&quot;P. f. fuscocapillus&quot; - hill country
*&quot;P. f. scotillum&quot; - low country wet zone

<doc id="632196" wikidata="Q174279" url="?curid=632196" title="Lanyard">
<text>A lanyard is a length of cord, webbing, or strap that may serve any of various functions, which include a means of attachment, restraint, retrieval, activation, and deactivation. A lanyard is also a piece of rigging used to secure or lower objects aboard a ship.

== Origins ==

The earliest references to lanyards date from 15th century France: &quot;lanière&quot; was a thong or strap-on apparatus.
Bosun&#x27;s pipe, marlinspike, and small knives typically had a lanyard consisting of a string loop tied together with a diamond knot. It helped secure the item and gave an extended grip over a small handle.

In the French military, lanyards were used to connect a pistol, sword, or whistle (for signaling) to a uniform semi-permanently. Lanyards were used by mounted cavalry on land and naval officers at sea. A pistol lanyard can be easily removed and reattached by the user, but will stay connected to the pistol whether it is drawn for use or it is placed into a holster for carrying.

In the military, lanyards of various colour combinations and braid patterns are worn on the shoulders of uniforms to denote the wearer&#x27;s qualification or regimental affiliation. In horse regiments, lanyards were worn on the left, enabling a rider to pull a whistle from the left tunic pocket and maintain communication with his troop. Members of the British Royal Artillery wear a lanyard which originally held a key for adjusting the fuzes of explosive shells.

== Functions ==

*An attachment lanyard is a light duty tether worn around the neck, shoulder, wrist or attached to the belt as a sling to conveniently carry items such as keys or identification cards, or as a safety harness to prevent accidental dropping of valuable handheld items such as a camera.
* A restraint lanyard is a safety lanyard used by construction workers, such as a lineman.
* A retrieval lanyard is a nylon webbing lanyard used to raise and lower workers into confined spaces, such as storage tanks.
* An activation lanyard is a lanyard used to fire an artillery piece or arm the fuze on a bomb leaving an aircraft.
* A deactivation lanyard is a dead man&#x27;s switch, where pulling a lanyard free will disable a dangerous device.

== Styles and materials ==
The style, design or material used will vary depending on end-purpose of the lanyard. Lanyard materials include polyester, nylon, satin, silk, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), braided leather or braided paracord.

=== Common styles ===
* Polyester imprinted lanyards
* Nylon imprinted lanyards
* Tube imprinted lanyards
* Dye-sublimated lanyards or full-color lanyards

=== Accessory for electronics ===
Lanyards are widely used with small electronic devices such as cameras, MP3 players and USB flash drives to prevent loss or dropping. Electronics designed to take a lanyard usually have a small through-hole built into a corner or edge of the case or anchored to the frame of the device; the corresponding lanyard generally has a loop of thread on the end that is attached to that hole with a simple knot, usually a cow hitch. Some earphones incorporate the audio signal into the lanyard, meaning it doubles up as headphone cords as well. The Wii Remote wrist strap is a form of lanyard, keeping the device attached to a player&#x27;s arm during the often vigorous movements involved in its use.

=== Badge or identification holder ===
Lanyards are commonly used to display badges, tickets or ID cards for identification where security is required, such as businesses, corporations, hospitals, prisons, conventions, trade fairs, and backstage passes used in the entertainment industry. Such lanyards are often made of braided or woven fabric or split with a clip attached to the end. A plastic pouch or badge holder with at least one clear side is attached to the lanyard with the person&#x27;s name badge or ID card. Occasionally, small items like business cards, pens or tools can be placed behind the badge for easy access. Lanyards can also be used as keychains, particularly in situations where keys can easily be lost, such as gyms, public pools and communal showers.

In these cases, lanyards may be customised with the related name and/or logo of the event, business, or organisation. Lanyards can feature a variety of customisation techniques including screen-printing, Jacquard loom weaving, heat transfer, and offset printing.

=== Safety strap ===
Lanyards are also often attached to dead man&#x27;s switches or &quot;kill switches&quot; on dangerous machinery, such as large industrial cutting or slicing machines, vehicles, jet-skis or trains, and exercise treadmills, so that if the operator suddenly becomes incapacitated, their fall will pull on the lanyard attached to their wrist, which will then pull the switch to immediately stop the machine or vehicle.

Some law enforcement officers and members of the military utilise specialised lanyards to keep sidearms from falling to the ground during missions.

Many ID card lanyards have a built-in feature known as a &quot;breakaway&quot; closure. Breakaway lanyards release when pulled or when pressure is applied. This prevents choking or hanging. Lanyards with a breakaway feature are most often used in hospitals and healthcare clinics, schools, nursing homes, child care facilities, and factories that require employees to operate machinery.

=== Lineman lanyards ===
Lineman lanyards are used by lineworker utility and other workers to prevent falls, although similar straps are also used recreationally by mountain climbers. This type of lanyard will have a section of heavy-duty nylon strapping attached to a metal ring or carabiner which tightens around an attachment point. The strap may be a fixed length or adjustable, and will attach to the wearer to support them against a fixed object or pole.

=== Uniform accessories ===
Certain lanyards are still worn on uniforms as decorations similar to an aiguillette or fourragère. Among these are the Orange Lanyard in the Military William Order of the Netherlands and the German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship.

A white lanyard has formed part of the uniform of Britain&#x27;s Royal Artillery (RA) since the end of the 19th century. Originally a simple cord carrying a fuse key, the braided and whitened lanyard became the recognised distinction of a Gunner. The distinction was extended to women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service attached to RA units during World War II. Certain battalions descended from the Durham Light Infantry wore green lanyards to denote their past links with the regiment, whose uniform had a dark green facing colour from 1903 onwards.

Royal Naval Rating wear a white lanyard when dressed in No. 1 uniform, the origin of the lanyard was to carry a pouch of gunpowder for the cannon.

<text>Lasus of Hermione () was a Greek lyric poet of the 6th century BC from the city of Hermione in the Argolid. He is known to have been active at Athens under the reign of the Peisistratids. Pseudo-Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;De Musica&quot; credits him with innovations in the dithyramb hymn. According to Herodotus, Lasus also exposed Onomacritus&#x27;s forgeries of the oracles of Musaeus. Lasus is recorded to have written a now lost treatise on music, of which very little is known.

<text>George Mamishisho Lamsa () (August 5, 1892 – September 22, 1975) was an Assyrian author. He was born in Mar Bishu in what is now the extreme east of Turkey. A native Aramaic speaker, he translated the Aramaic Peshitta Old and New Testaments into English. He popularized the claim of the Assyrian Church of the East that the New Testament was written in Aramaic and then translated into Greek, contrary to academic consensus.

==Life==
Lamsa fled from the Ottoman Empire during the 1910s during World War I, initially settling in South America. In the 1920s, he immigrated to the United States, where he lived for the rest of his life. He studied at the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria, Virginia and at Dropsie College in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On September 22, 1975, he died in Turlock, California.

==History and views==
Lamsa was a member of the Assyrian Church of the East, a Syriac church that uses the Peshitta as its Bible. Some of the modern Assyrian people speak a modern form of the classical Syriac language called Northeastern Neo-Aramaic. The Peshitta was written in classical Syriac, a dialect of Middle Aramaic, which is in turn a Semitic language. The language spoken in the first century would have been Old Aramaic, like the Judeo-Aramaic language, while Ancient Aramaic like Biblical Aramaic was used in Old Testament times.

Lamsa was a strong advocate of a belief traditionally held by part of that Church; that the Aramaic New Testament of the Peshitta was the original source text, and that the Greek texts were translated from it. According to Lamsa, &quot;Aramaic was the colloquial and literary language of Palestine, Syria, Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, from the fourth century B. C. to the ninth century A. D.&quot; This view of the Assyrian Church regarding the Language of the New Testament is rejected by mainstream scholarship, but Lamsa&#x27;s views won support among some churches such as The Way.

Lamsa further claimed that while most of the Old Testament was written in Hebrew, the original was lost and the present Hebrew version, the Masoretic text, was re-translated from the Peshitta.

Lamsa produced his own translation of the Bible in the form of &quot;The Holy Bible from Ancient Eastern Manuscripts&quot;, which is commonly called the &quot;Lamsa Bible&quot;.

===Translation of Matthew 19:24 with the word &#x27;rope&#x27;, instead of &#x27;camel&#x27;===
The Aramaic word for &#x27;camel&#x27; is written identically to the word for &#x27;rope.&#x27; Matthew 19:24, according to Lamsa, is correctly translated as, &#x27;It is easier for a rope to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.&#x27;

===Translation of &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani&quot;===
A notable difference between Lamsa&#x27;s translation and other versions of the New Testament occurs in the fourth of the Words of Jesus on the cross – &quot;Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani&quot;. That is regarded by more conservative scholars as a quotation in Aramaic of the opening of Psalm 22, which in English is &quot;My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?&quot; It is similar to how the psalm appears in the Aramaic Peshitta Old Testament and it appears in earlier Aramaic Targums. Lamsa believed that the text of the Gospels was corrupt and that it is not a quotation but should read /&quot;Eli, Eli, lemana shabaqthani&quot;, which he translates as: &quot;My God, my God, for this I was spared!&quot; An accompanying footnote in Lamsa&#x27;s English version of the Bible says Jesus&#x27;s meaning was &quot;This was my destiny.&quot;

Aramaic grammars and dictionaries, including CAL and Payne Smith, disagree with Lamsa&#x27;s assertion about Jesus&#x27; last words, as the word שבקתני [&quot;shvaqtani&quot;] in Aramaic is the &quot;perfect 2nd person singular&quot; form of the verb שבק [&quot;shvaq&quot;] which means &quot;to leave, to leave s.t. left over, to abandon,&quot; or &quot;to permit&quot; with the 1st person singular pronoun affixed. That would, in turn, cause the phrase to translate as &quot;why have you left me?&quot; &quot;why have you let me be?&quot; &quot;why have you abandoned me?&quot; or &quot;why have you permitted me?&quot;

== Reception ==

Where many scholars hold that the sources of the New Testament and early oral traditions of fledgling Christianity were indeed in Aramaic, the Peshitta appears to have been strongly influenced by the Byzantine reading of the Greek manuscript tradition and is in a dialect of Syriac that is much younger than the one that was contemporary to Jesus.

Critics of Lamsa assert that he, like many other native Aramaic-speakers, extend the semantic areas of words beyond the evidence of existent texts.

Bruce Chilton, scholar and prominent Aramaicist, has said:

&quot;A still less defensible tendency confuses Aramaic of the first century with Syriac, a different form of the language. The approach of George Lamsa, who used the Peshitta Syriac version as an index of replicating Jesus’ teaching in Aramaic, has been taken up and popularized by Neil Douglas-Klotz. This approach willfully perpetuates a basic confusion of language, since Aramaic and Syriac come from different centuries and areas (although they are closely related Semitic languages), and is based on uncritical treatment of the Peshitta, a Syriac version of the Gospels.&quot;

Neil Douglas-Klotz, former chair of the Mysticism Group of the American Academy of Religion, defends Lamsa and points out that the differences between the 1C Palestinian Aramaic and the Syriac of the Peshitta are minimal concerning the roots of the key words that Jesus must have used:

&quot;Aramaic Christians of all branches today use the version called the Peshitta, meaning “simple” or “straight.” It is in an Aramaic dialect called Syriac; however, all the major words that Jesus must have used are the same in his slightly earlier Palestinian Aramaic.&quot;

In 1989, the Christian Evangelical apologetics research ministry Christian Research Institute asserted in a published review that several of Lamsa&#x27;s theological positions and interpretations were not supported by the Bible. The review concludes by saying:

&quot;On the surface, Lamsa appears to be a revealer of biblical truth and culture and a friend of evangelical Christianity. Closer study, however, has revealed that Lamsa promotes metaphysical, not evangelical teachings which have led him to inaccurate interpretations and translations of portions of the Bible. As an ambassador of Nestorian, not biblical culture, Lamsa became a cultic figure in his own right.&quot;

Neil Douglas-Klotz makes the case that one needs to take into account both the way of knowing (epistemology) and psychology of ancient Semitic languages in order to properly interpret the words of a prophetic figure:

&quot;In ancient times, people knew everything by its context. They heard practical things in a practical way. They heard the words of a prophet or shaman on many possible levels if they had “ears to hear.” The ancient Semitic languages suited themselves to this multi-levelled understanding. They employ a root-and-pattern system in which individual letters and sounds each have meaning and then combine with one another to create new meanings... Later, Semitic grammar developed, and grammarians began to limit the basic root of meaning into set combinations of two or three letters. The ancient Semitic way was freer and more open; individual letters combined and recombined like notes in a jazz suite. From this creative process arises the multi-levelled translation and rendering of sacred texts called &quot;midrash&quot; in the early Jewish tradition, and &quot;ta’wil&quot; in the Islamic one.&quot;

William M. Branham, evangelist and personal friend to Lamsa has said:

&quot;To our gratification we find the words in both amazingly the same so that there is no difference actually in content or doctrine. We may even conclude that God has allowed these newly discovered manuscripts and recent publications of already known scripts to come before us to prove the authenticity of what we already had. And we find that though translators may fight each other, scripts do not.&quot;

Edwin Yamauchi was particularly critical of Lamsa&#x27;s adherence to Assyrian Church traditions about the Peshitta, in particular since the Peshitta is written in a later eastern dialect of Aramaic removed from the western dialect spoken in Judea at the time of Jesus. 

It is in fact Lamsa’s faith in the dogma of the Assyrian Church of Iraq which he grandiosely calls “the Church of the East” which serves as the basis of his conviction in the superiority of the Syriac Peshitta Version…. The Syriac of the Peshitta is not the language of coastal Syria around Antioch, which was evangelized in the first century A.D., but of the area in the interior around Edessa, one hundred fifty miles from the coast, which was evangelized between A.D. 116 and 216…. No one but an unquestioning adherent of “The Church of the East” would subscribe to the legendary account of the apostolic roots of the Edessene church. In the light of the claims advanced by Lamsa for Syriac, it should be underlined that Syriac is an eastern and not a western dialect of Aramaic, and indeed that it is “a form of Aramaic that emerges toward the beginning of the third century A.D.”

<text>Tormore distillery is a Speyside single malt Scotch whisky distillery located approximately 1 km south of the River Spey. Its water source is the Allt an Torra Mhoir Burn.

It is currently not open to the public

== History ==
The Tormore distillery construction began in 1958 and was completed in 1960.

Designed by Alexander Cullen with input from Sir Albert Richardson for Long John International, it is a listed building, and one of the most architecturally striking distilleries. The building is made of granite, has copper rotors and a clock which plays four different Scottish songs each quarter of an hour. A village of workers houses were built in the same style, which was up for sale in its entirety in 2004, for offers over £550,000. The topiary hedges in the garden are also clipped to the shape of a bell or still.

In 1972, the distillery was expanded from four to eight stills. These were converted to be heated by wood chips in 1984, a by-product of area&#x27;s forestry. Long John was absorbed by Whitbread &amp; Co in 1975, and the distillery was acquired by Allied Distillers Ltd the same year. The Tormore distillery has been controlled by Pernod-Ricard since they purchased Allied Domecq in 2005 and until it was sold to Elixir Distillers in 2022.

A time capsule in the shape of a pot-still is buried in the forecourt, which is intended to be opened in 2060. It contains glasses and a tregnum of Long John, the original owners’ own blended whisky.

==Bottlings==
Tormore&#x27;s malt whisky is currently sold in 14 and 16 year aged versions. There are also independent bottlings from Signatory Vintage, Cadenhead&#x27;s, Blackadder, That Boutique-y Whisky Company, Douglas Laing&#x27;s Xtra Old Particular and Provenance. The whisky is described as &quot;A smooth, nutty whisky which sometimes has a pear-like or melony character&quot; by Royal Mile Whiskies.

<text>The dark-fronted babbler (Dumetia atriceps) is an Old World babbler found in the Western Ghats of India and the forests of Sri Lanka. They are small chestnut brown birds with a dark black cap, a whitish underside and pale yellow iris. They forage in flocks in the undergrowth of forests constantly making calls and uttering alarm calls when disturbed.

==Taxonomy==

The dark-fronted babbler was formally described in 1839 by the English naturalist Thomas Jerdon under the binomial name &quot;Brachypteryx atriceps&quot;. He specified the range as Thrissur, Wadakkancherry, Coonoor and the Wayanad of southwest India. The type locality was restricted to Wayanad by Hugh Whistler in 1935. The dark-fronted babbler was formerly placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Rhopocichla&quot;. It was moved to &quot;Dumetia&quot; with the tawny-bellied babbler based on the results of a large molecular phylogenetic study published in 2019. The genus &quot;Dumetia&quot; was introduced in 1852 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth. The genus name is from Latin &quot;dumetum&quot;, &quot;dumeti&quot; meaning &quot;thicket&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;atriceps&quot; combines the Latin &quot;ater&quot; meaning &quot;black&quot; with &quot;-ceps&quot; meaning &quot;-capped&quot; or &quot;-headed&quot;.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;D. a. atriceps&quot; (Jerdon, 1839) – west to south India
* &quot;D. a. bourdilloni&quot; (Hume, 1876) – southwest to south India
* &quot;D. a. siccata&quot; (Whistler, 1941) – north, east Sri Lanka
* &quot;D. a. nigrifrons&quot; (Blyth, 1849) – southwest Sri Lanka

==Description==
The dark-fronted babbler measures 13 cm including its square-tipped tail. It is brown above and white below. The two subspecies in the Western Ghats have black hoods, but the two Sri Lankan races have this reduced to a dark bandit mask. The pale yellow iris stands in contrast. The subspecies in the southern Western Ghats &quot;bourdilloni&quot; has a duller sooty-black hood, browner underside and the upper parts are more olive. The nominate form found north of the Palghat Gap has the hood dark black. In Sri Lanka, the subspecies &quot;siccata&quot; is found in the lower elevation while &quot;nigrifrons&quot; is found in the wet zone. The former has more olive on the upperparts while the later is rufescent on the upperparts.

==Behaviour and ecology==

Babblers have a weak flight and are residents within their range. They forage in parties and clamber up vegetation and when disturbed, they tend to drop from the topmost perches of the bush into the undergrowth. Their typical habitat is undergrowth in forest or on the edge of forests in more open growth. Their food is mainly insects. They can be difficult to observe in the dense vegetation they prefer, but like other babblers, these are noisy birds, and their characteristic rattling &quot;churr&quot; alarm calls are often the best indication that these birds are present. They often join mixed-species foraging flocks.

The breeding season is May to July. This babbler builds its nest low down in a bush, the nest being a ball of leaves, often of bamboo. The nest looks like some dry leaves stuck in a bush with the opening on the side. The normal clutch is two eggs. They are also said to construct dormitory nests within which birds may sometimes roost. These dormitory nests are not lined.

<text>Nicolas Gombert (c. 1495 – c. 1560) was a Franco-Flemish composer of the Renaissance. He was one of the most famous and influential composers between Josquin des Prez and Palestrina, and best represents the fully developed, complex polyphonic style of this period in music history.

==Life==
Details of his early life are sketchy, but he was probably born around 1495 in southern Flanders, probably between Lille and Saint-Omer, possibly in the town of La Gorgue. German writer and music theorist Hermann Finck wrote that Gombert studied with Josquin; this would have been during the renowned composer&#x27;s retirement in Condé-sur-l&#x27;Escaut, sometime between 1515 and 1521.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nugent/Jas, Grove online&quot;&gt;Nugent/Jas, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;

Gombert was employed by the emperor Charles V as a singer in his court chapel in 1526 and possibly as a composer as well. Most likely he was taken on while Charles was passing through Flanders, for the emperor traveled often, bringing his retinue with him, and picking up new members as he went. A document dated 1529 mentions Gombert as &quot;magister puerorum&quot; (&quot;master of the boys&quot;) for the royal chapel. He and the singers went with the emperor on his travels throughout his holdings, leaving records of their appearances in various cities of the empire. These visits were musically influential, in part because of Gombert&#x27;s stature as a musician; thus the travels of Charles and his chapel, as did those of his predecessor Philip I of Castile with composer Pierre de la Rue, continued the transplantation of the Franco-Flemish polyphonic tradition onto the Iberian Peninsula. At some point in the 1530s Gombert became a cleric and probably a priest; he received benefices at several cathedrals, including Courtrai, Lens, Metz, and Béthune. He remained in the Imperial chapel as &quot;maître des enfants&quot; (&quot;master of the children&quot;) until some time between 1537 and 1540, being succeeded by Thomas Crecquillon and later Cornelius Canis. Even though he held this very position at the Imperial chapel, he never officially received the title of &quot;maître de chapelle&quot; – music director – which was a title given to both Adrien Thibaut and Crecquillon. While serving in this position, he likewise unofficially held the position of court composer, arranging numerous works commemorating the key happenings during Charles&#x27; life.

In 1540 during the height of his career, he vanished from chapel records. According to a contemporary physician and mathematician Jerome Cardan, writing in &quot;Theonoston&quot; (1560), in 1540 Gombert was convicted of sexual contact with a boy in his care and was sentenced to hard labor in the galleys. The exact duration of his service in the galleys is not known, but he was able to continue composing for at least part of the time. Most likely he was pardoned sometime in or before 1547, the date he sent a letter along with a motet from Tournai to Charles&#x27; &quot;gran capitano&quot; Ferrante I Gonzaga. The &quot;Magnificat&quot; settings preserved uniquely in manuscript in Madrid are often held to have been the &quot;swansongs&quot; that according to Cardan won his pardon; according to this story, Charles was so moved by these Magnificat settings that he let Gombert go early. An alternative hypothesis (Lewis 1994) is that Cardan was referring to the highly penitential First Book of four-part motets; however, in neither case is it clear how Gombert was able to compose while rowing in the galleys as a prisoner.

It is not known how long Gombert lived after his pardon or what positions, if any, he held; his career faded into relative obscurity after he was freed. He may have retired to Tournai, spending the final years of his life as canon there. Bracketing dates for his probable death are 1556 and 1561; in the former year Finck mentioned that he was still living, and in 1561 Cardan wrote that he was dead, without giving details.

==Music and style==
Adrian Willaert and Nicolas Gombert are generally recognized as the exemplars of the late Franco-Flemish school, before the center of Renaissance art-music moved to Italy. A Fleming, Willaert relocated to Italy and along with the originally Flemish composer Orlando di Lasso brought the Franco-Flemish style of simultaneously dense and lyrical counterpoint to Italy. Like Willaert, Gombert brought the polyphonic style to its highest state of perfection; if imitation is a common device in Josquin, it is integral in Gombert.

Gombert&#x27;s style is characterized by dense, inextricable polyphony. Extended homophonic passages are rare in his sacred works, and he is particularly fond of imitation at very close time intervals, a technically very difficult feat (although he only rarely wrote strict canon). He preferred the lower voice ranges instead of the four voices (SATB) which were the most common voicings for pieces at the time, such as five and six parts in mostly male registers. Gombert, unlike his predecessor and mentor, Josquin des Prez, used irregular numbers of voice entries and avoided precise divisions of phrases, resulting in a less-punctuated, more continuous sonic landscape. Syncopations and cross-accents are characteristic of his rhythmic idiom, giving ictus to his otherwise seamless, enduring lines.

Harmonically, Gombert&#x27;s compositions stressed the traditional modal framework as a baseline, but especially in dense textures of six or more voices, he wrote polymodal sections wherein a subset of voices would sing the lowered pitches of F or B while another subset would sing the raised pitches of F or B: a D major and D minor chord or a G major and a G minor chord might be simultaneously sounded . Melodic motion in one voice that, to retain melodic and harmonic coherence with the other voices, employed &quot;musica ficta&quot;, or an extended set of pitches from the basic modal framework, was very prominent in his musical stylings. The false relations, usually between an F and an F or a B and B, create a dissonance that Gombert employed for emotional effect while adhering to traditional rules of counterpoint.

Exemplary among Gombert&#x27;s formally perfect pieces that employ cross-relations are his six-voice motet on the death of Josquin, &quot;Musae Jovis&quot;, with its clashing semitones, and occasional root-position triads a tritone apart., and his six-voice chanson &quot;Tous les Regretz&quot;.

Out of the ten masses that Gombert composed, nine survive complete. The chronology of the masses is not known, but an approximate order can be deduced from stylistic characteristics. Two musical characteristics, sequence and ostinato, that were rare in Gombert’s later works, are present in his earlier masses &quot;Quam pulchra es&quot; and &quot;Tempore paschali&quot;.

The motet was Gombert&#x27;s preferred form, and his compositions in this genre not only were the most influential part of his output, but they show the greatest diversity of compositional technique. His motets, alongside those of Adrian Willaert and Jacobus Clemens non Papa, stand out from the rest of the Flemish motet composers. Familiar characteristics of motets of the preceding generation, such as ostinato, canon, cantus firmus, and double texts, are unusual in Gombert&#x27;s style, excepting where he used aspects of the previous generation&#x27;s style as an homage, such as in his motet on the death of Josquin, &quot;Musae Jovis&quot;. When considering texts for his motets, Gombert obtained his inspiration from Scripture – such as the Psalms – as opposed to the liturgy of the Roman Catholic church. He was less attentive to textual placement and clarity than to the overall expressive sonority.

Gombert&#x27;s eight settings of the &quot;Magnificat&quot;, which may have won him his pardon, are among his most famous works. Each is written in one of the church modes, and consists of a cycle of short motets, with the individual motets based on successive verses of the Magnificat text.

Some of Gombert&#x27;s works are for unusually large vocal ensembles, including 8, 10, and 12 voices. These works are not polychoral in the usual sense, or in the manner of the Venetian School in which the voices were spatially separated; rather, the voice sub-groupings change during the pieces. These large ensemble compositions include an eight-voice &quot;Credo,&quot; the 12-voice &quot;Agnus&quot; from the &quot;Missa Tempore paschali&quot;, and 10- and 12- voice settings of the &quot;Regina caeli&quot;. In comparison with the northern Italian &quot;cori spezzati&quot; style, Gombert’s multi-voice works were not antiphonal. Instead of dividing forces consistently, Gombert frequently changed the combinations of voice groups. These vocal pieces contained more direct repetition, sequence and ostinato than his other music.

His secular compositions – mostly &quot;chansons&quot; – are less contrapuntally complex than his motets and masses, but more so than the majority of contemporary secular pieces, especially the &#x27;Parisian&#x27; chanson. During the middle of the sixteenth century, Gombert received credit for several of the Parisian chansons, but later studies have discovered that he was not the sole &#x27;Nicolas&#x27; of those secular pieces but many were actually by Nicolas de La Grotte or Guillaume Nicolas. Authors of the texts used in many chansons, a genre in which Gombert excelled, were mostly anonymous. He turned to older verse, often of a folkish type, with typical subject matter including unhappy love, farewells, separations, infidelities and the like. Many of these chansons appeared in lute and vihuela arrangements, with their wide geographical distribution showing their immense popularity.

His surviving works include 10 masses, about 140 motets, about 70 chansons, a canción (probably written when he was in Spain), a madrigal, and a handful of instrumental pieces.

==Influence==
Gombert was one of the most renowned composers in Europe after the death of Josquin des Prez, as can be seen by the wide distribution of his music, the use of his music as source material for compositions by others, including Orlando di Lasso and Claudio Monteverdi. Printers paid singular attention to him, issuing for example, editions consisting solely of his works – most print editions at the time were anthologies of music by several composers. Although highly admired by his contemporaries, the next generation of Franco-Flemish composers mostly wrote in a more simplified style. Part of this was an inevitable stylistic reaction to a contrapuntal idiom which had reached an extreme, and part of this was due to the specific dictates of the Council of Trent, which required that text be understandable in sacred, especially liturgical, music – something which is next to impossible for a composer to achieve in a dense imitative texture.

While most composers of the next generation did not continue to write vocal music using Gombert&#x27;s method of pervasive imitation, they continued to use this contrapuntal texture in instrumental works. Forms such as the &quot;canzona&quot; and &quot;ricercar&quot; are directly descended from the vocal style of Gombert; Baroque forms and processes such as the fugue are later descendants. Gombert&#x27;s music represents one of the extremes of contrapuntal complexity ever attained in purely vocal music.

<text>Hadrosaurus (; ) is a genus of hadrosaurid ornithopod dinosaurs that lived in North America during the Late Cretaceous Period in what is now the Woodbury Formation in New Jersey about 83.6 to 77.9 Ma. The holotype specimen was found in fluvial marine sedimentation, meaning that the corpse of the animal was transported by a river and washed out to sea. Some fossils are found in the Tar Heel/Coachman Formation.

They were large animals ranging from and . Most of the preserved elements are very robust, unusual traits in hadrosaurs. &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; were ponderously built animals equipped with keratinous beaks for cropping foliage and a specialized and complex dentition for food processing.

Hadrosaurus foulkii, the only species in this genus, is known from a single specimen consisting of much of the skeleton and parts of the skull. The specimen was collected in 1858 from the Woodbury Formation in New Jersey, US, representing the first dinosaur species known from more than isolated teeth to be identified in North America. Using radiometric dating of bivalve shells from the same formation, the sedimentary rocks where the &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; fossil was found have been dated at some time between 83.6 and 77.9 million years ago. In 1868, the only known specimen became the first-ever dinosaur skeleton to be mounted. In 1991, &quot;H. foulkii&quot; became the official state dinosaur of New Jersey.

==History of discovery==

In 1838, John Estaugh Hopkins was digging in a marl pit (on a small tributary of the Cooper River in Haddonfield, New Jersey, and part of the Campanian-age Woodbury Formation) when he uncovered large bones. He put them on display at his home, also in Haddonfield. In 1858, the bones sparked the interest of a visitor, William Parker Foulke, who dug out the rest of the bones from the marl pit in the same year. The excavation site, known as the &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot; Leidy Site, is now a National Historic Landmark.

Foulke contacted paleontologist Joseph Leidy, and together they recovered eight teeth from the maxillar and dentary areas, dental battery fragments, left maxilla fragments, three partial dorsal vertebrae, 13 caudal centra, including an almost complete middle caudal vertebra. Other fragments included a partial right coracoid, left humerus, left radius, left ulna, left ilium, right ischium, right partial pubis, the left hindlimb composed by the femur, tibia, fibula with metatarsals II and IV and the first pedal phalanx from the third digit. Foulke and Leidy studied the fossils together and, in 1858, Leidy formally described and named &quot;Hadrosaurus foulkii&quot; in honor of his collaborator. While originally a portmanteau of Haddonfield, the location of its discovery with the accepted suffix for dinosaurs -saurus, the name &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was scientifically justified as deriving from the Greek , , meaning &quot;bulky&quot; or &quot;large&quot;, and , , meaning &quot;lizard&quot;. The name was an additional play on words by Leidy since it translates from Greek as &quot;Foulke&#x27;s big lizard&quot;.

Leidy recognized that the bones were from a dinosaur because of their similarity to those of &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, discovered in England some decades before but, at the time, the skeleton of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was one of the most complete dinosaur skeletons known. Leidy&#x27;s monograph &quot;Cretaceous Reptiles of the United States&quot;, describing &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; more completely, and with illustrations, was written in 1860, but the American Civil War delayed its publication until 1865.

Leidy reconstructed &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; as a biped, in contrast to the view at the time that such dinosaurs were quadrupedal. The entire skeleton was completely assembled in 1868 by a team including English sculptor and naturalist Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins and was put on display at Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences. It was the first-ever mounted dinosaur skeleton. When the skeleton was first put together, it was displayed with a plaster skull sculpted by Hawkins. Many other artists have recreated &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; with skulls from other, related species such as &quot;Gryposaurus&quot; and &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot;. A statue of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot;, sculpted by Haddonfield resident John Giannotti, now stands in the center of the town of Haddonfield, commemorating its discovery there. Thanks to Joyce Berry and her fourth-grade classes (1988–1991) at Strawbridge Elementary School in Haddon Township, New Jersey, the &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was named the state dinosaur of New Jersey in 1991. It is one of the most celebrated dinosaurs ever and is of great historic importance. The skeleton is usually kept out of sight in the Academy&#x27;s collections. However, from November 22, 2008, to April 19, 2009, a fully assembled cast of the skeleton, and an exhibit about the science and culture surrounding the dinosaur&#x27;s discovery, was open to the public.

==Description==
&quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; were large-sized animals growing up to and weighing as much as . According to Prieto-Márquez, &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; can be distinguished in having a shortened pectoral crest that is slightly over 40% of the total humeral length, a deltopectoral crest that is developed from the humeral shaft causing the laterodistal border to display a broad lateral facet, a lower greatest point of the supraacetabular crest located above lateral edge from the rear to the bottom on the posterior tuberosity of the ischial peduncle of the ilium, a shortened supraacetabular crest from the front to the rear with its breadth being half the length of the middle iliac plate.

As in most hadrosaurs, the forelimbs were not as heavily built as the hindlimbs, but were long enough to be used in standing or movement. The holotype specimen was a relatively large animal at the time of death with a femur and tibia. Most of the preserved elements feature a marked robust composition with the fibula being one of the most robust among hadrosaurs.

==Classification==

Despite the fact that the family Hadrosauridae has &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; as its type genus, the skeleton lacks a skull and was long viewed as too incomplete to compare to other hadrosaurs for classification purposes, leading most scientists to consider it a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;, or dubious name. However, a re-evaluation of the fossil material in 2011 noted several distinct characteristics of the skeleton that could allow the genus &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; and species &quot;H. foulkii&quot; to remain in use as valid taxa.

&quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; has also traditionally served as the basis for a large subfamily called Hadrosaurinae, which was seen as a group of largely crestless hadrosaurs related to the crested subfamily Lambeosaurinae. However, the changing view of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; classification in relation to other hadrosaurs has led some scientists to rename these subfamilies. In a 2008 study, &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was found to be more primitive than either lambeosaurines or other &quot;hadrosaurines&quot;, and not a particularly close relative of classic &quot;hadrosaurines&quot; such as &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Saurolophus&quot;. As a result of this, the name Hadrosaurinae was restricted to &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; alone, and the subfamily comprising the traditional &quot;hadrosaurines&quot; was renamed the Saurolophinae.

Below is a simplified cladogram recovered by Ramírez-Velasco &quot;et al.&quot; in 2012 in their description of &quot;Huehuecanauhtlus&quot;. This topology was recovered using an extensive sampling of 60 hadrosauroid species, and two outgroup taxa, which were scored based on 287 morphological traits, and included data from two recent redescriptions of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; by Prieto-Márquez &quot;et al.&quot; (2006) and Prieto-Márquez (2011).


==Paleobiology==

In 2003, Rothschild and colleagues performed a study looking for epidemiology of tumors in dinosaurs. Evidence of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer and osteoblastoma were discovered in specimens of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; by analyzing dinosaur vertebrae using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including &quot;Brachylophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Edmontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Gilmoreosaurus&quot;, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; and other hadrosaurs. The tumors were only found on caudal vertebrae and they may have been caused by environmental factors or genetic inheritance.

==Paleoecology==
The holotype of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was found in marine sediments, which suggests the skeleton was transported by a river and then deposited in the Cretaceous sea. The &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; remains all persist to the Woodbury Formation. Through the radiometric dating of bivalve shells known from the formation, the sedimentary rocks where the holotype specimen of &quot;Hadrosaurus&quot; was found have been dated from 80.5 million to 78.5 million years ago. However, a more accurate date make range from 83.6 to around 77.9 mya.

<text>In computer science, compare-and-swap (CAS) is an atomic instruction used in multithreading to achieve synchronization. It compares the contents of a memory location with a given value and, only if they are the same, modifies the contents of that memory location to a new given value. This is done as a single atomic operation. The atomicity guarantees that the new value is calculated based on up-to-date information; if the value had been updated by another thread in the meantime, the write would fail. The result of the operation must indicate whether it performed the substitution; this can be done either with a simple boolean response (this variant is often called compare-and-set), or by returning the value read from the memory location (&quot;not&quot; the value written to it), thus &quot;swapping&quot; the read and written values.

==Overview==
A compare-and-swap operation is an atomic version of the following pseudocode, where denotes access through a pointer:

 function cas(p: pointer to int, old: int, new: int) is
 if *p ≠ old
 return false
 *p ← new
 return true

This operation is used to implement synchronization primitives like semaphores and mutexes, as well as more sophisticated lock-free and wait-free algorithms. Maurice Herlihy (1991) proved that CAS can implement more of these algorithms than atomic read, write, or fetch-and-add, and assuming a fairly large amount of memory, that it can implement all of them. CAS is equivalent to load-link/store-conditional, in the sense that a constant number of invocations of either primitive can be used to implement the other one in a wait-free manner.

Algorithms built around CAS typically read some key memory location and remember the old value. Based on that old value, they compute some new value. Then they try to swap in the new value using CAS, where the comparison checks for the location still being equal to the old value. If CAS indicates that the attempt has failed, it has to be repeated from the beginning: the location is re-read, a new value is re-computed and the CAS is tried again. Instead of immediately retrying after a CAS operation fails, researchers have found that total system performance can be improved in multiprocessor systems—where many threads constantly update some particular shared variable—if threads that see their CAS fail use exponential backoff—in other words, wait a little before retrying the CAS.

===Example application: atomic adder===
As an example use case of compare-and-swap, here is an algorithm for atomically incrementing or decrementing an integer. This is useful in a variety of applications that use counters. The function performs the action , atomically (again denoting pointer indirection by , as in C) and returns the final value stored in the counter. Unlike in the pseudocode above, there is no requirement that any sequence of operations is atomic except for .

 function add(p: pointer to int, a: int) returns int
 done ← false
 while not done
 value ← *p // Even this operation doesn&#x27;t need to be atomic.
 done ← cas(p, value, value + a)
 return value + a

In this algorithm, if the value of changes after (or while!) it is fetched and before the CAS does the store, CAS will notice and report this fact, causing the algorithm to retry.

===ABA problem===

Some CAS-based algorithms are affected by and must handle the problem of a false positive match, or the ABA problem. It is possible that between the time the old value is read and the time CAS is attempted, some other processors or threads change the memory location two or more times such that it acquires a bit pattern which matches the old value. The problem arises if this new bit pattern, which looks exactly like the old value, has a different meaning: for instance, it could be a recycled address, or a wrapped version counter.

A general solution to this is to use a double-length CAS (DCAS). E.g., on a 32-bit system, a 64-bit CAS can be used. The second half is used to hold a counter. The compare part of the operation compares the previously read value of the pointer &quot;and&quot; the counter, with the current pointer and counter. If they match, the swap occurs - the new value is written - but the new value has an incremented counter. This means that if ABA has occurred, although the pointer value will be the same, the counter is exceedingly unlikely to be the same (for a 32-bit value, a multiple of 232 operations would have to have occurred, causing the counter to wrap and at that moment, the pointer value would have to also by chance be the same).

An alternative form of this (useful on CPUs which lack DCAS) is to use an index into a freelist, rather than a full pointer, e.g. with a 32-bit CAS, use a 16-bit index and a 16-bit counter. However, the reduced counter lengths begin to make ABA possible at modern CPU speeds.

One simple technique which helps alleviate this problem is to store an ABA counter in each data structure element, rather than using a single ABA counter for the whole data structure.

A more complicated but more effective solution is to implement safe memory reclamation (SMR). This is in effect lock-free garbage collection. The advantage of using SMR is the assurance a given pointer will exist only once at any one time in the data structure, thus the ABA problem is completely solved. (Without SMR, something like a freelist will be in use, to ensure that all data elements can be accessed safely (no memory access violations) even when they are no longer present in the data structure. With SMR, only elements actually currently in the data structure will be accessed).

===Costs and benefits===
CAS, and other atomic instructions, are sometimes thought to be unnecessary in uniprocessor systems, because the atomicity of any sequence of instructions can be achieved by disabling interrupts while executing it. However, disabling interrupts has numerous downsides. For example, code that is allowed to do so must be trusted not to be malicious and monopolize the CPU, as well as to be correct and not accidentally hang the machine in an infinite loop or page fault. Further, disabling interrupts is often deemed too expensive to be practical. Thus, even programs only intended to run on uniprocessor machines will benefit from atomic instructions, as in the case of Linux&#x27;s futexes.

In multiprocessor systems, it is usually impossible to disable interrupts on all processors at the same time. Even if it were possible, two or more processors could be attempting to access the same semaphore&#x27;s memory at the same time, and thus atomicity would not be achieved. The compare-and-swap instruction allows any processor to atomically test and modify a memory location, preventing such multiple-processor collisions.

On server-grade multi-processor architectures of the 2010s, compare-and-swap is cheap relative to a simple load that is not served from cache. A 2013 paper points out that a CAS is only 1.15 times more expensive than a non-cached load on Intel Xeon (Westmere-EX) and 1.35 times on AMD Opteron (Magny-Cours).

==Implementations==
Compare-and-swap (and compare-and-swap-double) has been an integral part of the IBM 370 (and all successor) architectures since 1970. The operating systems that run on these architectures make extensive use of this instruction to facilitate process (i.e., system and user tasks) and processor (i.e., central processors) parallelism while eliminating, to the greatest degree possible, the &quot;disabled spinlocks&quot; which had been employed in earlier IBM operating systems. Similarly, the use of test-and-set was also eliminated. In these operating systems, new units of work may be instantiated &quot;globally&quot;, into the global service priority list, or &quot;locally&quot;, into the local service priority list, by the execution of a single compare-and-swap instruction. This substantially improved the responsiveness of these operating systems.

In the x86 (since 80486) and Itanium architectures this is implemented as the compare and exchange (CMPXCHG) instruction (on a multiprocessor the prefix must be used).

As of 2013, most multiprocessor architectures support CAS in hardware, and the compare-and-swap operation is the most popular synchronization primitive for implementing both lock-based and non-blocking concurrent data structures.

The atomic counter and atomic bitmask operations in the Linux kernel typically use a compare-and-swap instruction in their implementation.
The SPARC-V8 and PA-RISC architectures are two of the very few recent architectures that do not support CAS in hardware; the Linux port to these architectures uses a spinlock.

===Implementation in C===
Many C compilers support using compare-and-swap either with the C11 codice_1 functions, or some non-standard C extension of that particular C compiler, or by calling a function written directly in assembly language using the compare-and-swap instruction.

The following C function shows the basic behavior of a compare-and-swap variant that returns the old value of the specified memory location; however, this version does not provide the crucial guarantees of atomicity that a real compare-and-swap operation would:
int compare_and_swap(int* reg, int oldval, int newval)
 ATOMIC();
 int old_reg_val = *reg;
 if (old_reg_val == oldval)
 *reg = newval;
 END_ATOMIC();
 return old_reg_val;


codice_2 is always returned, but it can be tested following the codice_3 operation to see if it matches codice_4, as it may be different, meaning that another process has managed to succeed in a competing codice_3 to change the reg value from codice_4.

For example, an election protocol can be implemented such that every process checks the result of codice_3 against its own PID (= newval). The winning process finds the codice_3 returning the initial non-PID value (e.g., zero). For the losers it will return the winning PID.

This is the logic in the Intel Software Manual Vol 2A:
bool compare_and_swap(int *accum, int *dest, int newval)
 if (*accum == *dest) {
 *dest = newval;
 return true;
 } else {
 *accum = *dest;
 return false;
}
==Extensions==
Since CAS operates on a single pointer-sized memory location, while most lock-free and wait-free algorithms need to modify multiple locations, several extensions have been implemented.

; Double compare-and-swap (DCAS): Compares two unrelated memory locations with two expected values, and if they&#x27;re equal, sets both locations to new values. The generalization of DCAS to multiple (non-adjacent) words is called MCAS or CASN. DCAS and MCAS are of practical interest in the convenient (concurrent) implementation of some data structures like deques or binary search trees. DCAS and MCAS may be implemented however using the more expressive hardware transactional memory present in some recent processors such as IBM POWER8 or in Intel processors supporting Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX).
; Double-wide compare-and-swap: Operates on two adjacent pointer-sized locations (or, equivalently, one location twice as big as a pointer). On later x86 processors, the CMPXCHG8B and CMPXCHG16B instructions serve this role, although early 64-bit AMD CPUs did not support CMPXCHG16B (modern AMD CPUs do). Some Intel motherboards from the Core 2 era also hamper its use, even though the processors support it. These issues came into the spotlight at the launch of Windows 8.1 because it required hardware support for CMPXCHG16B.
; Single compare, double swap: Compares one pointer but writes two. The Itanium&#x27;s cmp8xchg16 instruction implements this, where the two written pointers are adjacent.
; Multi-word compare-and-swap: Is a generalisation of normal compare-and-swap. It can be used to atomically swap an arbitrary number of arbitrarily located memory locations. Usually, multi-word compare-and-swap is implemented in software using normal double-wide compare-and-swap operations. The drawback of this approach is a lack of scalability.
; Persistent compare-and-swap: Is a combination of persist operation and the normal compare-and-swap. It can be used to atomically compare-and-swap a value and then persist the value, so there is no gap between concurrent visibility and crash visibility. The extension solves the read-of-non-persistent-write problem.

<text>Colin McGinn (born 10 March 1950) is a British philosopher. He has held teaching posts and professorships at University College London, the University of Oxford, Rutgers University, and the University of Miami.

McGinn is best known for his work in philosophy of mind, and in particular for what is known as new mysterianism, the idea that the human mind is not equipped to solve the problem of consciousness. He has written over 20 books on this and other areas of philosophy, including &quot;The Character of Mind&quot; (1982), &quot;The Problem of Consciousness&quot; (1991), &quot;Consciousness and Its Objects&quot; (2004), and &quot;The Meaning of Disgust&quot; (2011).

In 2013, McGinn resigned from his tenured position at the University of Miami after a graduate student accused him of sexual harassment. His resignation touched off a debate about the prevalence of sexism and sexual harassment within academic philosophy.

==Early life and education==
McGinn was born in West Hartlepool, a town in County Durham, England. Several of his relatives, including both grandfathers, were miners. His father, Joseph, left school to become a miner but put himself through night school and became a building manager instead. McGinn was the eldest of three children, all boys. When he was three, the family moved to Gillingham, Kent, and eight years later to Blackpool, Lancashire. Having failed his 11-plus, he attended a technical school in Kent, then a secondary modern in Blackpool, but did well enough in his O-levels to transfer to the local grammar school for his A-levels.

In 1968, McGinn began a degree in psychology at the University of Manchester, obtaining a first-class honours degree in 1971 and an MA in 1972, also in psychology. In 1972, he was admitted to Jesus College, Oxford, initially to study for a Bachelor of Letters postgraduate degree. He switched to the Bachelor of Philosophy (BPhil) postgraduate programme on the recommendation of his advisor, Michael R. Ayers. In 1973, McGinn received the university&#x27;s John Locke Prize in Mental Philosophy; one of the examiners was A. J. Ayer. He received his BPhil in 1974, writing a thesis under the supervision of Ayers and P. F. Strawson on the semantics of Donald Davidson.

==Teaching career==
===Posts===
McGinn taught at University College London for 11 years, first as a lecturer in philosophy (1974–84), then as reader (1984–85). In 1985, he succeeded Gareth Evans as Wilde Reader in Mental Philosophy at the University of Oxford, a position he held until 1990. He held visiting professorships at the University of California, Los Angeles (1979), University of Bielefeld (1982), University of Southern California (1983), Rutgers University (1984), University of Helsinki (1986), City University of New York (1988) and Princeton University (1992). In 1990, he joined the philosophy department at Rutgers as a full professor, working alongside Jerry Fodor.

In 2006, he joined the University of Miami as Professor of Philosophy and Cooper Fellow.

===Sexual harassment complaint===
McGinn resigned his position at the University of Miami in January 2013, effective at the end of the calendar year, after a graduate student complained that he had been sexually harassing her, including by text and email. These documents have since been released and include explicit references to McGinn&#x27;s desire to have sex with the student. He denied any wrongdoing.

Represented by Ann Olivarius, the student complained in April 2014 to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that the university had mishandled the case. She filed a lawsuit in October 2015 against the university, McGinn, and Edward Erwin, another philosophy professor at the University of Miami. The complaint accused McGinn of sexual harassment, civil assault, and defamation, and Erwin of defamation. It alleged that the university had violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (which requires that women have equal access to education) by failing to investigate the student&#x27;s complaint adequately or protect her from retaliation, including from McGinn on his blog before his resignation came into effect. McGinn&#x27;s lawyer, Andrew Berman, said that McGinn denied the claim. The lawsuit was settled in October 2016. All parties are prohibited from disclosing the terms of the settlement.

The incident triggered a debate about the extent to which sexism remains prevalent in academia, particularly in academic philosophy, and the effect on students and teachers of harassment and harassment-related complaints.

In 2014, East Carolina University offered McGinn a visiting professorship but university administrators later rescinded the offer. McGinn blamed the sexual-harassment allegations for East Carolina&#x27;s decision.

In 2024, McGinn wrote: &quot;I have existed in a state of professional cancellation for over ten years now. Before that I had normal access to teaching positions, publishers, conferences, professional contacts, and so on. Not anymore.&quot;

==Writing==
===Philosophy of mind===
McGinn has written extensively on philosophical logic, metaphysics, and philosophy of language, but is best known for his work in philosophy of mind. He is known in particular for the development of the idea that human minds are incapable of solving the problem of consciousness, a position known as new mysterianism. In addition to his academic publications on consciousness, including &quot;The Character of Mind&quot; (1982), &quot;The Problem of Consciousness&quot; (1991) and &quot;Consciousness and Its Objects&quot; (2004), he has written a popular introduction, &quot;The Mysterious Flame: Conscious Minds in a Material World&quot; (1999).

Owen Flanagan introduced the term &quot;new mysterians&quot; in 1991 (named after the band Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians) to describe McGinn&#x27;s position and that of Thomas Nagel, first described in Nagel&#x27;s &quot;What Is It Like to Be a Bat?&quot; (1974). McGinn introduced his position in &quot;Can We Solve the Mind-Body Problem?&quot; (&quot;Mind&quot;, 1989), and in &quot;The Problem of Consciousness&quot; (1991), arguing that the human mind is incapable of comprehending itself entirely. Mark Rowlands writes that the 1989 article was largely responsible for reviving the debate about phenomenal consciousness, or the nature of experience. McGinn argued in the paper for the idea of cognitive closure:

Although human beings might grasp the concept of consciousness, McGinn argues that we cannot understand its causal basis: neither direct examination of consciousness nor of the brain can identify the properties that cause or provide the mechanism for consciousness, or how &quot;technicolour phenomenology [can] arise from soggy grey matter.&quot; Thus, his answer to the hard problem of consciousness is that the answer is inaccessible to us.

New, or epistemological, mysterianism is contrasted with the old, or ontological, form, namely that consciousness is inherently mysterious or supernatural. The new mysterians are not Cartesian dualists. The argument holds that human minds cannot understand consciousness, not that there is anything supernatural about it. The mind-body problem is simply &quot;the perimeter of our conceptual anatomy making itself felt.&quot; McGinn describes this as existential naturalism.

===Animal rights===
McGinn is a supporter of animal rights, calling our treatment of non-humans &quot;deeply and systematically immoral.&quot; His position is that we make the mistake of seeing the non-human only in relation to the human, because of &quot;species solipsism&quot;: the farmer sees animals as food, the pet owner as companions for humans, the activist as victims of humans, the evolutionary biologist as &quot;gene survival machines.&quot; But &quot;their &quot;esse&quot; is not human &quot;percipi&quot;&quot; – &quot;The rhino looks at us with the same skewed solipsism we bring to him,&quot; McGinn writes, &quot;and surely we do not want to be as limited in our outlook as he is.&quot; He argues that &quot;we need to improve our &quot;manners&quot;&quot; toward animals by recognizing that they have their own lives, and that those lives ought to be respected.

===Novels and articles===
McGinn has regularly contributed reviews and short stories to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and has written occasionally for &quot;Nature&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;. He has also written two novels, &quot;The Space Trap&quot; (1992) and &quot;Bad Patches&quot; (2012).

==Radio and television==
In 1984, McGinn discussed John Searle&#x27;s Reith lectures on BBC Radio Three with Searle, Richard Gregory and Colin Blakemore. The next year, he and Sir Andrew Huxley debated animal rights with Bernard Williams as the moderator. He was interviewed for Jonathan Miller&#x27;s 2003 documentary miniseries &quot;&quot;, later broadcast as &quot;The Atheism Tapes&quot; (2004), and published an article titled &quot;Why I am an Atheist&quot;. He has also appeared in 11 episodes of &quot;Closer to Truth&quot; hosted by Robert Lawrence Kuhn, discussing consciousness, personal identity, free will, and materialism.

<text>The &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot; (or simply &quot;The Four&quot;) were four judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit who, during the late 1950s, became known for a series of decisions (which continued into the late 1960s) crucial in advancing the civil and political rights of African Americans.

== History ==
In their most famous cases, they were opposed by fellow Fifth Circuit judge Ben Cameron, an avowed white supremacist. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (the limits of its jurisdiction since October 1, 1981), but also Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone. 

&quot;The Four&quot; were Richard T. Rives, Elbert Parr Tuttle (who served as Chief Judge from 1960-67), John R. Brown (who succeeded Tuttle as Chief Judge), and John Minor Wisdom. All but Rives were liberal Republicans; Rives was a Democrat and friend of Supreme Court justice Hugo Black.

The jurisprudence of the group led to expansion of the rights granted in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; to other areas of society, such as employment, integration, and voting rights. Since Brown did not specify the mechanisms for desegregation, it was crucial that lower federal courts such as the Fifth Circuit expanded civil rights law. In several court cases, such as &quot;Louisiana v. United States&quot;, the court struck down &quot;race neutral&quot; laws that functionally denied African Americans their rights due to unequal application. In response, the judges faced major backlash from their communities, who were largely against integration and civil rights for African Americans. The judges received many phone threats and had their personal property destroyed or vandalized.

==Quote==
&quot;The Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination. The criterion is the relevancy of color to a legitimate government purpose.&quot;

—Judge John Minor Wisdom, writing for the majority in &quot;United States v. Jefferson County Board of Education&quot;, 1966.

<text>Naval Air Station Glenview or NAS Glenview was an operational U.S. Naval Air Station from 1937 to 1995. Located in Glenview, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, the air base primarily operated training aircraft as well as seaplanes on nearby Lake Michigan during World War II. Reconfigured as a Naval Air Reserve base following World War II, NAS Glenview supported Naval Air Reserve, Marine Air Reserve/4th Marine Aircraft Wing, and U.S. Army Reserve 244th Aviation Group as well as an active duty Coast Guard Air Station.

==History==

===Pre-military history===
The base was originally built by the Curtiss Flying Service and intended to be the hub of Chicago&#x27;s air service. When the field was dedicated as Curtiss Field on 20 October 1929, it was home to the largest hangar built to that time, Hangar One. Hangar One, one of the most advanced hangars at the time, included many innovations which were considered state-of-the-art in its time. A one gigacandela electric light was erected which allowed for airfield activity in the dark. A system of carefully designed sliding doors created dividers for storage and zone heating. Glassed-in galleries allowed passengers the opportunity to watch the mechanics at work on the ground floor. A passenger-friendly restaurant and lounge were opened in the upper levels. A loudspeaker system informed the passengers of the flight arrivals and departures. The final cost for the airfield and Hangar One was $3 million in 1930. By adjusting the price for inflation, the relative cost in 2017 would equate to about $44.8 million. It was widely believed to be one of the Midwest&#x27;s finest airports.

In 1930, the National Air Races took place at Curtiss-Reynolds Airport/Curtiss Field and in 1933 the International Air Races took place there in conjunction with the Century of Progress. Such aviation luminaries as Charles Lindbergh, Wiley Post, Jimmy Doolittle and Art Chester attended. In 1934, Post tried to set an aviation altitude record from Curtiss. By 1938, civilian and military operations both operated from the field, but in 1940 it was sold to the United States Navy.

===Military presence===

====U.S. Navy====
Reduced military budgets between World War I and World War II forced the War Department and the Navy Department to place increased emphasis on Reserve and National Guard manpower, with many of the facilities for the personnel of these organizations located in major metropolitan areas, given their status as centers of civilian employment. One course pursued by the U.S. Navy was to establish a series of Naval Reserve Air Bases (NRABs), the third one of which was established near Chicago adjacent to the then-Naval Training Station Great Lakes. Reservists initially flew and maintained seaplanes from shore facilities on Lake Michigan and a small field at Naval Training Station Great Lakes. These facilities eventually became inadequate for newer and larger aircraft entering the Fleet in the 1930s, and it was recommended that the NRAB be relocated to Curtiss-Reynolds Airport/Curtiss Field. This recommendation was approved and military construction at Curtiss Field began on 4 January 1937, followed by an official dedication as NRAB Chicago on 28 August For the next three years, the air station&#x27;s primary role was elimination training for students seeking appointments as Naval Aviation Cadets (NAVCADs). Those students meeting the required standards were later transferred to NAS Pensacola, Florida for further flight training. By 1941, with the United States&#x27; entry into World War II appearing imminent, it was apparent to the naval leadership in Washington DC that the primary flight training facilities concentrated at and around NAS Pensacola would not be able to accommodate the needed expansion in Naval Aviation. As a result, naval planners opted to transfer primary flight training to multiple Naval Reserve Air Bases around the country and use NAS Pensacola for advanced training. NRAB Chicago was selected to be the first base in this program as a proof of concept. A subsequent construction program of 121 work days resulted in of new concrete being poured for runways, taxiways and ramps, while new hangars and other administrative and support buildings were also constructed and completed by late November 1942. On 1 January 1943, NRAB Chicago was redesignated as NAS Chicago. By 1944, &quot;Chicago&quot; was deleted from the air station&#x27;s title and the installation renamed NAS Glenview.

Nearly 9,000 aviation cadets for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard received their primary flight training at NAS Glenview during World War II, which represented over 800,000 flight hours and over 2 million takeoffs and landings. Later during the war, NAS Glenview also hosted advanced training in Fleet combat aircraft, primarily for carrier qualification in Lake Michigan aboard the Chicago-homeported training aircraft carriers USS Sable (IX-81) and USS Wolverine (IX-64) of the 9th Naval District Carrier Qualification Training Unit (CQTU).

Following the end of World War II, NAS Glenview discontinued its role as a primary training base and became headquarters for the newly formed Naval Air Reserve Training Command (NAVAIRESTRACOM) in 1946. NAVAIRESTRACOM&#x27;s primary responsibility was the oversight of numerous reserve naval air stations throughout the US where experienced Naval Aviators, enlisted Naval Aircrewmen, and maintenance personnel from World War II could affiliate as Naval Reservists and maintain their aviation proficiency should their skills be needed for future conflicts. These skills were readily proven when squadrons and personnel were mobilized and recalled back to active duty during the Korean War and the Berlin Crisis. Each base also had an assigned Naval Air Reserve Training Unit (NARTU), which until a reorganization of the Naval Air Reserve in 1970, actually &quot;owned&quot; all assigned aircraft. One of the better units based at NAS Glenview in the post-World War II period was Attack Squadron 725 (VA-725), part of NARTU Glenview until 1970, when it was redesignated as Attack Squadron 209 (VA-209) and became part of Carrier Air Wing Reserve TWENTY (CVWR-20) from 1970 to 1972. Initially flying the A-4B Skyhawk, the squadron later transitioned to the A-4L Skyhawk. From 1967 to 1972, part of VA-725-&quot;cum&quot;-VA-209 also operated as the &quot;Air Barons&quot;, a Naval Air Reserve precision flight demonstration team that augmented the U.S. Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, the &quot;Blue Angels&quot;, and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s demonstration squadron, the &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, at air show locations other than those where the &quot;Blue Angels&quot; or &quot;Thunderbirds&quot; were performing on a given weekend during the air show season. Both VA-209 and the &quot;Air Barons&quot; were disestablished in 1972. 
During the latter half of the Cold War from 1970 until 1990, and continuing on from the post-Cold War period until 1995, NAS Glenview was primarily the home of two Naval Air Reserve patrol squadrons, Patrol Squadron SIXTY (VP-60) and Patrol Squadron NINETY (VP-90). Initially equipped with the P-2 Neptune, both later transitioned to the P-3A Orion, followed by another transition the P-3B Orion maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. These aircraft were home based at NAS Glenview and manned by a combination of full-time active duty Training and Administration of the Reserve (TAR) personnel and part-time Selected Naval Reservists (SELRES). Training activities were conducted from NAS Glenview and the patrol squadrons routinely deployed overseas for anti-submarine warfare operations against Soviet submarines and surface ships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean or for other operations in the Caribbean.

Another Naval Air Reserve squadron at NAS Glenview was Fleet Logistics Support Squadron FIFTY-ONE (VR-51), operating the C-118 aircraft and later C-9B Skytrain II aircraft, providing operational support airlift and transport of military personnel and cargo worldwide. VR-51&#x27;s noteworthy service included support of US military operations in Lebanon and Grenada during the 1980s and between the US and multiple bases in Southwest Asia during Operations DESERT SHIELD / DESERT STORM in the 1990s.

Through the mid-1990s, NAS Glenview was also home to twenty-seven Naval Air Reserve reinforcing/sustaining augmentation units, to include two patrol squadron augmentation units containing additional P-3 flight crews in an active flying status that also routinely flew VP-60 and VP-90 aircraft, as well as oversight of Naval Air Reserve training programs and associated reinforcing/sustaining units at Naval Air Reserve Center (formerly Naval Air Station) Twin Cities, Minnesota, the latter facility now part of Minneapolis-Saint Paul Joint Air Reserve Station.

Before its closure due to a 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision, the base was also used as a staging area and departure point for aircraft participating in the annual Chicago Air &amp; Water Show. Following the 1993 BRAC decision, VP-60 and VP-90 were also slated for disestablishment and their respective P-3B aircraft either distributed to other Reserve patrol squadrons, identified for transfer to NATO and Allied military forces under the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, or retired and mothballed. VR-51 was also disestablished concurrent with VP-60 and VP-90, with its C-9B aircraft similarly distributed to other VR squadrons or mothballed. In November 1997 a new squadron using the designation VR-51 was established as a Naval Air Reserve squadron at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii, where it currently operates C-20G Gulfstream IV aircraft. The majority of NAS Glenview&#x27;s Naval Reserve reinforcing/sustaining units were also disestablished, with their reserve personnel either retiring from the Navy or transferring to other Regular Navy or Naval Reserve commands/units at other bases.

====U.S. Marine Corps====
The air station was also home to Marine Corps aircraft. In 1959, the Marine Corps Reserve established the Marine Helicopter Transportation Squadron 776 (HMR-776) at NAS Glenview with HUP-2 helicopters. The squadron was redesignated as Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron 776 (HMM-776) in 1962 and changed aircraft to the CH-34D. In 1972, the squadron was redesignated for the last time to Marine Light Helicopter Squadron 776 (HML-776) and changed aircraft to the UH-1E which was eventually upgraded to the UH-1N. This unit was deployed in 1991 in support of Operation Desert Storm and returned to NAS Glenview 10 months later. HML-776 was deactivated in 1994. NAS Glenview was also home to the 4th Marine Aircraft Wing&#x27;s Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 234 (VMGR-234 and its KC-130F and KC-130T Hercules aircraft until 1994, when the squadron was permanently relocated to NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas as part of the BRAC-mandated closure of NAS Glenview.

====U.S. Army====
The Fort Sheridan, IL Flight Detachment (FSFD) relocated its C-12, U-21 and UH-1 aircraft from Fort Sheridan&#x27;s Haley Army Airfield near Highwood, IL to NAS Glenview in 1978. Operating from NAS Glenview&#x27;s Hangar 1, the active duty Army Flight Detachment provided U.S wide executive transport flight operations to U.S. Army Recruiting Command, Military Enlistment Processing Command, Fourth U.S. Army, USARMR V and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers - Chicago District which were all headquartered at Fort Sheridan.

The Fort Sheridan Flight Detachment operated until the closure of Fort Sheridan, IL in 1991.

====U.S. Coast Guard====
Coast Guard Air Station Chicago was commissioned as a tenant activity on the northwest corner of NAS Glenview in March 1969 and equipped with HH-52 Seaguard helicopters. Primarily a search and rescue (SAR) activity for the Great Lakes, Air Station Chicago was the primary U.S. Coast Guard aerial SAR unit for southern Lake Michigan, responsible for the waters from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Muskegon, Michigan and south to Gary, Indiana.

In April 1995, Coast Guard Air Station Traverse City gained operational responsibility for what was CGAS Chicago. Renamed Coast Guard Air Facility Glenview, the station remained on the base during NAS Glenview&#x27;s BRAC closure process and consisted of a multipurpose hangar, office facility and public works building. Air Facility Glenview staged one of Air Station Traverse City&#x27;s HH-65A Dolphin helicopters with two full crews during the busy search and rescue season from April through mid-November. However, CGAF Glenview subsequently ceased operations on 15 November 1996 and its operations eventually relocated to the current Coast Guard Air Facility Waukegan, Illinois.

===1993 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission Decision===
Towards the end and following the end of the Cold War, BRAC Commissions were established to shed what the Department of Defense and the U.S. Congress considered to be excess military units and infrastructure. The 1993 BRAC identified NAS Glenview for closure no later than 30 September 1995, along with corresponding inactivation or transfer of its assigned squadrons and other units.

===Post-BRAC===
On 29 June 1998, the Navy transferred the last segment of the closed Naval Air Station Glenview (BRAC 1993) from Navy ownership to private ownership, with the Village of Glenview, Illinois and the Local Reuse Authority (LRA) taking possession of over 90% of the closed and transferring portion of the base. The first transfer occurred in September 1997, with the remaining 10% transferred in October 1999. This last 10% contained the remaining sites that required some form of remedial environmental action. The 90% milestone was because the operational closure of the base occurred in September 1995, just two years after the base was selected for closure during BRAC 1993 (aka &quot;BRAC III&quot;). Since then, much of the base property had been idle. The new use plan for the base was different from the previous airfield use, with much of the land and facilities seeing extensive demolition and redevelopment. The importance of the redevelopment effort was significant. NAS Glenview was located in the geographic center of the Village of Glenview and contained 15% of the landmass. Once redevelopment planners decided not to use the existing infrastructure as an airfield, alternate plans were developed. The resulting plan called for a &quot;mixed use&quot; scenario providing open space and public land, senior and residential housing, recreational and sports areas, mixed retail areas, a business park with an area used as a &quot;prairie reserve&quot;, and a new railroad station. Since the existing air base infrastructure had to be demolished to make room for a new supporting infrastructure, it was important for the LRA to develop the base in systematic stages.

Removed were 1 million cubic yards of concrete, 1.5 miles of runways and 108 former Department of Defense buildings. In their place is The Glen, a 1,121 acre mixed-use district, with new homes, offices, and retail space, although the control tower and Hangar 1 have been preserved as a historic building. Hangar 1, including the control tower, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998 as building #98001357. However, according to the Glenview Hangar One Foundation, 85% of Hangar One was dismantled even following efforts by the foundation and the U.S. Navy to preserve historical buildings.

The crash occurred after a possible stall at around , during a wing-over. The plane crashed into a landfill just north of Willow Road to avoid surrounding residential areas. All four crew members aboard perished.
*On 16 August 1986, a U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon piloted by Capt Vince Aamato, USAF, lost power at 15,000 feet and was guided to a safe landing at NAS Glenview by Jeff McCoy, an air traffic controller at O&#x27;Hare.
*On 3 March 1991, a U.S. Navy CT-39G Sabreliner crashed into a residential area at Dewes Street during a visual approach to NAS Glenview. All three crew members aboard perished. As the jet approached the street, the pilot turned the plane such that the wings were perpendicular to the street in &quot;knife-blade&quot; fashion. The jet crashed into the center of the street, and the only damage on the ground was fire damage to the front of 2 houses and a few trees were burned. The village established a scholarship fund for the survivors of the crew.

<text>Elbert Parr Tuttle (July 17, 1897 – June 23, 1996) was the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit from 1960 to 1967, when that court became known for a series of decisions crucial in advancing the civil rights of African Americans during the civil rights movement. A Republican from Georgia, he was among the judges that became known as the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot;. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (its jurisdiction ), but also Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone.

==Education and early career==

Tuttle was born in Pasadena, California. In 1906, his family moved to Hawaii where he attended Punahou School. In October 1910, he and his brother Malcolm built and flew the first glider in Hawaii.

Tuttle graduated from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1918 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Tuttle was the editor in chief of The Cornell Daily Sun. He was also the founder of the Beta Theta chapter of Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity at Cornell and was a member of the Sphinx Head Society. He then fought in World War I in the United States Army Air Service from 1918 to 1919.

Tuttle received a Bachelor of Laws from Cornell Law School, where he served as editor-in-chief of the &quot;Cornell Law Quarterly&quot;, in 1923. He was a reporter for the &quot;New York Evening World&quot; for several years while attending law school.

==Later career==

After graduating from law school, he moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to practice law with the law firm of Sutherland, Tuttle &amp; Brennan from 1923 to 1953 (the firm is now Eversheds Sutherland). Tuttle worked on tax litigation and also did &quot;pro bono&quot; work, including with the American Civil Liberties Union, and took on numerous civil rights cases.

Tuttle served as a colonel in the United States Army from 1941 to 1946, in World War II, declining a desk job. He was severely injured after engaging in hand-to-hand combat in Okinawa on the island of Ie Shima. He was awarded numerous medals for his service including the Purple Heart with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Bronze Service Arrowhead. Tuttle retired as a brigadier general and was often called &quot;The General&quot; by those who worked closely with him. After the War, Tuttle became more involved in politics, working with the Republican Party because of his opposition to segregation, which he associated mostly with southern Democrats. He was a general counsel for the United States Department of the Treasury from 1953 to 1954.

==Federal judicial service==

Tuttle was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on July 7, 1954, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, to a new seat authorized by 68 Stat. 8. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on August 3, 1954, and received his commission the next day. He served as Chief Judge from 1960 to 1967 and was a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1961 to 1967. He assumed senior status on June 1, 1968. He was reassigned by operation of law to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on October 1, 1981, pursuant to 94 Stat. 1994. His service terminated on June 23, 1996, due to his death in Atlanta.

===Georgia gubernatorial election dispute===

In the aftermath of the disputed 1966 Georgia gubernatorial election between Democrat Lester Maddox and Republican Bo Callaway, Tuttle joined Judge Griffin Bell, later the United States Attorney General, in striking down the Georgia constitutional provision requiring that the legislature chose the governor if no general election candidate receives a majority of the vote. The judges concluded that a malapportioned legislature might &quot;dilute&quot; the votes of the candidate with a plurality, in this case Callaway. Bell compared legislative selection to the former County Unit System, a kind of electoral college formerly used in Georgia to select the governor but invalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Bell and Tuttle granted a temporary suspension of their ruling to permit appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court and stipulated that the state could resolve the deadlock so long as the legislature not make the selection. In a five-to-four decision known as &quot;Fortson v. Morris&quot;, the high court struck down the Bell-Tuttle legal reasoning and directed the legislature to choose between Maddox and Callaway. Two liberal justices, William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas, had argued against legislative selection of the governor, but the court majority, led this time by Hugo Black took the strict constructionist line and cleared the path for Maddox&#x27;s ultimate election.

==Honors==

The Elbert P. Tuttle U.S. Court of Appeals Building was named in his honor in 1989. For his work in civil rights cases in the South, Tuttle received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1981. He has a star on Atlanta&#x27;s International Civil Rights Walk of Fame.

<text>RPG is a high-level programming language for business applications, introduced in 1959 for the IBM 1401. It is most well known as the primary programming language of IBM&#x27;s midrange computer product line, including the IBM i operating system. RPG has traditionally featured a number of distinctive concepts, such as the program cycle, and the column-oriented syntax. The most recent version is RPG IV, which includes a number of modernization features, including free-form syntax.

==Platforms==
The RPG programming language originally was created by IBM for their 1401 systems. IBM later produced implementations for the 7070/72/74 and System/360; RPG II became the primary programming language for their midrange computer product line, (the System/3, System/32, System/34, System/38, System/36 and AS/400). There have also been implementations for DEC VAX, Sperry Univac BC/7, Univac system 80, Siemens BS2000, Burroughs B700, B1700, Hewlett Packard HP 3000, the ICL 2900 series, Honeywell 6220 and 2020, Four-Phase IV/70 and IV/90 series, Singer System 10 and WANG VS, as well as miscellaneous compilers and runtime environments for Unix-based systems, such as Infinite36 (formerly Unibol 36), and PCs (Baby/400, Lattice-RPG).

RPG II applications are still supported under the VSE and z/OS operating systems, Unisys MCP, Microsoft Windows and OpenVMS.

==History==
===Background===
Originally developed by IBM in 1959, the name &quot;Report Program Generator&quot; was descriptive of the purpose of the language: generation of reports from data files. FOLDOC accredits Wilf Hey with work at IBM that resulted in the development of RPG. FARGO (Fourteen-o-one Automatic Report Generation Operation) was the predecessor to RPG on the IBM 1401.

Both languages were intended to facilitate ease of transition for IBM tabulating machine (Tab) unit record equipment technicians to the then-new computers. Tab machine technicians were accustomed to plugging wires into control panels to implement input, output, control and counter operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Tab machines programs were executed by impulses emitted in a machine cycle; hence, FARGO and RPG emulated the notion of the machine cycle with the program cycle. RPG was superior to and rapidly replaced FARGO as the report generator program of choice.

IBM later implemented RPG(7070-RG-902), but not FARGO, on the IBM 7070/72/74.

The alternative languages generally available at the time were Assembler, COBOL or FORTRAN. Assembler and COBOL were more common in mainframe business operations (System/360 models 30 and above) and RPG more commonly used by customers who were in transition from tabulating equipment (System/360 model 20).

===RPG II===

&quot;RPG II&quot; was introduced about 1969 with the System/3 series of computers. It was later used on System/32, System/34, and System/36, with an improved version of the language. RPG II was also available for larger systems, including the IBM System/370 mainframe running DOS/VSE (then VSE/SP, VSE/ESA, and z/VSE). ICL also produced a version on its VME/K operating system.

In the early days of RPG, its major strength was the &quot;program cycle&quot;. A programmer would write code to process an individual record, and the program cycle would execute the change against every record of a file, taking care of the control flow. At that time each record (individual punched card) would be compared to each line in the program, which would act upon the record, or not, based upon whether that line had an &quot;indicator&quot; turned &quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;. The indicator consisted of a set of logical variables numbered 01–99 for user-defined purposes, or other smaller sets based upon record, field, or report processing functions. The concept of level breaks and matching records is unique to the RPG II language, and was originally developed with card readers in mind. The matching record feature of the cycle enabled easy processing of files having a header-to-detail relationship. RPG programs written to take advantage of the program cycle could produce complex reports with far fewer lines of computer code than programs written in COBOL and other business-centric languages. 
The program File Specifications, listed all files being written to, read from or updated, followed by Data Definition Specifications containing program elements such as Data Structures and dimensional arrays, much like a &quot;Working-Storage&quot; section of a COBOL program. This is followed by Calculation Specifications, which contain the executable instructions. Output Specifications can follow which can be used to determine the layout of other files or reports. Alternatively files, some data structures and reports can be defined externally, mostly eliminating the need to hand code input and output (&quot;I/O&quot;) specifications.

===RPG III===

&quot;RPG III&quot; was created for the System/38 and its successor the AS/400. RPG III significantly departed from the original language, providing modern structured constructs like IF-ENDIF blocks, DO loops, and subroutines. RPG III was also available for larger systems including the IBM System/370 mainframe running OS/VS1. It was also available from Unisys for the VS/9 operating system running on the UNIVAC Series 90 mainframes.

Since the introduction of the IBM System/38 in 1979 most RPG programmers discontinued use of the cycle in favor of controlling program flow with standard looping constructs, although IBM has continued to provide backward compatibility for the cycle.

====DE/RPG====
&quot;DE/RPG&quot; or Data Entry RPG was exclusively available on the IBM 5280 series of data-entry workstations in the early &#x27;80s. It was similar to RPG III but lacking external Data Descriptions (DDS) to describe data(files) like on the System/38 and its successors. Instead, the DDS part had to be included into the RPG source itself.

====RPG/400====

&quot;RPG/400&quot; was effectively RPG III running on AS/400. IBM renamed the RPG compiler as &quot;RPG/400&quot; but at the time of its introduction it was identical to the RPG III compiler on System/38. Virtually all IBM System/38 products were rebranded as xxx/400 and the RPG compiler was no exception. RPG III compiled with the RPG/400 compiler offered nothing new to the RPG III language until IBM began development of new operation codes, such as SCAN, CAT and XLATE after several years of AS/400 availability. These enhancements to RPG III were not available in the System/38 version of RPG III.

=== RPG IV and ILE RPG===

&quot;RPG IV&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;RPG ILE&quot;, was released in 1994 as part of the V3R2 release of OS/400 (now known as IBM i). 
With the release of RPG IV, the RPG name was officially no longer an initialism. RPG IV offered a greater variety of expressions within its Extended Factor-2 Calculation Specification and, later in life, its free-format Calculation Specifications and Procedure syntax.
RPG IV in the Integrated Language Environment framework is known as ILE RPG, and user guides explain the nuances of both. RPG IV and ILE RPG are supported by IBM in the current IBM i platform.

In 2001, with the release of OS/400 V5R1, RPG IV offered greater freedom for calculations than offered by the Extended Factor-2 Calculation Specification: a &quot;free-format&quot; text-capable source entry, as an alternative to the original column-dependent source format. The &quot;/FREE&quot; calculation did not require the operation code to be placed in a particular column; the operation code is optional for the EVAL and CALLP operations; and syntax generally more closely resembles that of mainstream, general-purpose programming languages. Until November 2013, the free format applied exclusively to the calculation specifications. With the IBM i V7R1 TR7 upgrade to the language, the &quot;/free&quot; and &quot;/end-free&quot; calculations are no longer necessary, and the language has finally broken the ties to punched cards.

IBM Rational Developer for i (RDi), an Eclipse-based Integrated Development Environment, is recommended by IBM for RPG development. The Source Entry Utility (SEU) text editor is no longer recommended for RPG development, and development ceased after IBM i 6.1. Other legacy developer tools include CODE/400 (based on IBM WorkFrame/2) and VisualAge for RPG.

====Continuing language enhancements====

IBM continues to enhance the RPG language via software releases and intra-release “technology refreshes” (TRs). More built-in functions (BIFs) have been added. It has the ability to link to Java objects, and IBM i APIs; it can be used to write CGI programs with the help of IBM&#x27;s Cgidev2 Web toolkit, the RPG Toolbox, and other commercial Web-enabled packages. Even with the changes, it retains a great deal of backward compatibility, so an RPG program written 37 years ago could run today with little or no modification.

The SQL precompiler allows current RPG developers to take advantage of IBM&#x27;s cost-based SQE (SQL Query Engine). With the traditional F-Spec approach a developer had to identify a specific access path to a data set, now they can implement standard embedded SQL statements directly in the program. When compiled, the SQL precompiler transforms SQL statements into RPG statements which call the database manager programs that ultimately implement the query request.

The RPG IV language is based on the EBCDIC character set, but also supports UTF-8, UTF-16 and many other character sets. The threadsafe aspects of the language are considered idiosyncratic by some as the compiler team has addressed threads by giving each thread its own static storage, rather than make the RPG run-time environment re-entrant. This has been noted to muddle the distinction between a thread and a process (making RPG IV threads a kind of hybrid between threads and processes).

In 2010, IBM launched &quot;RPG Open Access&quot;, also known as &quot;Rational Open Access: RPG Edition&quot;. It allows new I/O handlers to be defined by a programmer - enabling data to be read from and written to sources which RPG does not provide inbuilt support for.

==Data types==
RPG supports the following data types.

Note:The character in the &quot;data type&quot; column is the character that is encoded on the Definition Specification in the column designated for data type. To compare, in a language like C where definitions of variables are free-format and would use a keyword such as int to declare an integer variable, in RPG, a variable is defined with a fixed-format Definition Specification. In the Definition Specification, denoted by a letter D in column 6 of a source line, the data type character would be encoded in column 40. Also, if the &quot;data type&quot; character is omitted, that is, left blank, the default is A if no decimal positions are specified, P when decimal positions are specified for stand-along fields, and S (ZONED) when decimal positions are specified within a data structure.

==Example code==
The following program receives a customer number as an input parameter and returns the name and address as output parameters.
This is the most primitive version of RPG IV syntax. The same program is shown later with gradually more modern versions of the syntax and gradually more relaxed rules.
The same program using free calculations available starting in V5R1:
Assume the ARMSTF1 example table was created using the following SQL Statement:
create table armstf1
(arcnum decimal(7,0),
 arname char(30),
 aradd1 char(30),
 aradd2 char(30),
 arcity char(25),
 arstte char(2),
 arzip char(10))
The same program using free calculations and embedded SQL:

As of V7R1 of the operating system, the above program would not necessarily need the prototype in a separate file, so it could be completely written as:

 H main(GetCustInf)
 D ARMSTF1 E DS
 P GetCustInf B
 D GetCustInf PI extpgm(&#x27;CUS001&#x27;)
 D inCusNo like(arCNum) const
 D outName like(arName)
 D outAddr1 like(arAdd1)
 D outAddr2 like(arAdd2)
 D outCity like(arCity)
 D outState like(arStte)
 D outZip like(arZip)
 /free
 exec sql select arName, arAdd1, arAdd2, arCity, arStte, arZip
 into :outName, :outAddr1, :outAddr2, :outCity, :outState,
 :outZip
 from ARMSTF1
 where arCNum = :inCusNo
 fetch first 1 row only
 with CS
 use currently committed;
 /end-free
 P GetCustInf E

Lastly, if you apply the compiler PTFs related Technology Refresh 7 (TR7) to your 7.1 operating system, then the above program can be coded completely in free-form, as follows:

 ctl-opt main(GetCustInf);
 dcl-ds ARMSTF1 ext end-ds;
 dcl-proc GetCustInf;
 dcl-pi *n extpgm(&#x27;CUS001&#x27;);
 inCusNo like(arCNum) const;
 outName like(arName);
 outAddr1 like(arAdd1);
 outAddr2 like(arAdd2);
 outCity like(arCity);
 outState like(arStte);
 outZip like(arZip);
 end-pi;
 exec sql select arName, arAdd1, arAdd2, arCity, arStte, arZip
 into :outName, :outAddr1, :outAddr2, :outCity, :outState,
 :outZip
 from ARMSTF1
 where arCNum = :inCusNo
 fetch first 1 row only
 with CS
 use currently committed;
 return;
 end-proc;

<text>John Minor Wisdom (May 17, 1905 – May 15, 1999), one of the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot;, and a Republican from Louisiana, was a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit during the 1950s and 1960s, when that court became known for a series of crucial decisions that advanced the goals of the Civil Rights Movement. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (its jurisdiction since October 1, 1981), but also Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone.

==Early life and education==

Wisdom was born on May 17, 1905, in New Orleans, Louisiana, and graduated from the Isidore Newman School. In 1925, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia. In 1929, he received a Bachelor of Laws from Tulane University Law School, graduating first in his class.

== Early career ==
Wisdom was a United States Army lieutenant colonel from 1942 to 1946. He was in private practice of law in New Orleans from 1929 to 1957. He was an adjunct professor of law at Tulane University from 1938 to 1957. As a young man, he was a Democrat, but he left that party in reaction to what he perceived as the corrupt administration of Governor Huey Pierce Long, Jr. As the Republican National Committeeman from Louisiana, Wisdom was instrumental in securing the nomination of Dwight D. Eisenhower at the 1952 Republican National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. Wisdom was also credited for helping Eisenhower to win Louisiana in the 1956 general election, the first time Louisiana had voted Republican in 80 years.
==Federal judicial service==

In what was seen as a reward for his services, Wisdom was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on March 14, 1957, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Wayne G. Borah. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on June 26, 1957, and received his commission the next day. He was a member of the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) from its creation in 1968 and was the Panel’s chairman from 1975 until 1978. He served on the Special Court created under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act starting in 1975, becoming Presiding Judge from 1986, when Judge Henry Friendly retired, until 1996 when the Special Court was dissolved. He assumed senior status on January 15, 1977. His service terminated on May 15, 1999, due to his death in New Orleans.

From 1947 to 1972 John Minor Wisdom lived at Brevard-Rice House, 1239 First Street, in New Orleans Garden District.

==Honors==

President Bill Clinton awarded Wisdom the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993. On May 25, 1994, the Fifth Circuit&#x27;s headquarters in New Orleans was renamed the John Minor Wisdom U.S. Court of Appeals Building.

===Legacy===

Upon his death, Wisdom left all of his writings, papers, and a variety of other personal effects, to Tulane University Law School, which now displays them in the law school building, Weinmann Hall. He also left a sizable collection of his personal Mardi Gras memorabilia to the University of New Orleans.

Wisdom is one of the subjects of the book &quot;Unlikely Heroes&quot; by Jack Bass, about the Southern Federal judges who helped implement the desegregation of the South. A full-length biography, &quot;Champion of Civil Rights: Judge John Minor Wisdom&quot;, was written by Professor Joel William Friedman of Tulane Law School, and was published in January 2009 by Louisiana State University Press.

==Quote==

&quot;The Constitution is both color blind and color conscious. To avoid conflict with the equal protection clause, a classification that denies a benefit, causes harm, or imposes a burden must not be based on race. In that sense the Constitution is color blind. But the Constitution is color conscious to prevent discrimination being perpetuated and to undo the effects of past discrimination. The criterion is the relevancy of color to a legitimate government purpose.&quot;

: - Wisdom, writing for the majority in &quot;U.S. v. Jefferson County Board of Education&quot;, 372 F.2d 836 (1966).

<doc id="632244" wikidata="Q3851554" url="?curid=632244" title="The Master's University">
<text>The Master&#x27;s University is a private non-denominational Christian university in Santa Clarita, California.

== History ==
The college was founded in 1927. It was originally named Los Angeles Baptist College and Seminary. In 1961, it moved to Newhall in Santa Clarita, California. In 1985, John MacArthur became the school president; the name was changed to The Master&#x27;s College, hoping to appeal to a wider evangelical audience. In 2016, the school underwent another name change and became The Master&#x27;s University. In June 2019 John MacArthur stepped down as president and became chancellor and John Stead, a faculty member since 1970, became the interim president. In 2020, Sam Horn became president of The Master&#x27;s University and Seminary. John Stead in his 50th year at TMU took the role of Senior Vice President. Dr. Abner Chou now serves as the Interim President of TMUS.

== Academics ==
The university consists of seven schools offering bachelor&#x27;s degrees and master&#x27;s degrees, including several bachelor&#x27;s degrees that are offered fully online. The associated seminary offers a Bachelor of Theology (Th.B.) for those with an associate degree, master&#x27;s degrees, and Doctor of Ministry (D.Min.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees.

In addition to its biblical studies program, the university offers a one-year, intensive Bible training program known as &quot;The Master&#x27;s Institute&quot; resulting in a Bible certificate. The university has an extension campus, Israel Bible Extension (IBEX) in the Jerusalem vicinity.

The university&#x27;s schools are the School of Biblical Studies, Pearl C. Schaffer School of Education, John P. Stead School of Humanities, Paul T. Plew School of Music, School of Online Education, School of Business &amp; Communication, School of Science, Mathematics, Technology &amp; Health.

=== Accreditation ===

The university has been accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (now the WASC Senior College and University Commission) since 1975. In July 2018, it was placed on probation. WASC reported a lack of qualified leadership and &quot;a climate of fear, intimidation, bullying, and uncertainty&quot; among faculty and staff as reasons for the probation. Probation was lifted in November 2020.

The school is a member of the Association of Christian Schools International. The schools also holds Evangelical Council for Financial Accountability (ECFA) accreditation. The School of Music is also accredited by the National Association of Schools of Music.

=== LGBT discrimination ===

The university prohibits &quot;homosexuality or bisexual conduct&quot; by students in its student handbook. The university may legally expel LGBT students because it has a religious exemption from anti-discrimination laws. Chancellor John MacArthur has spoken and written at length in university publications about the threat he perceives from the gay agenda, asserting that &quot;biblical love excludes homosexuality because of its sinfulness.&quot;

The Master&#x27;s University is ranked among the worst American schools for LGBT students by LGBTQ Nation and Campus Pride.

== Athletics ==
The Master&#x27;s athletic teams are called the Mustangs. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Golden State Athletic Conference (GSAC) for most of its sports since the 2001–2002 academic year; while its men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s swimming &amp; diving teams compete in the Pacific Collegiate Swim and Dive Conference (PCSC).

The Master&#x27;s compete in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (outdoor) and volleyball; while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, beach volleyball, cross country, golf, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Soccer===
Curtis Lewis, head coach of the women&#x27;s soccer team, won the NAIA Women&#x27;s Soccer Coach of the Year Award in 2008. In 2009, Jim Rickard won the NAIA Men&#x27;s Soccer Coach of the Year Award.

<text>John Robert Brown (December 10, 1909 – January 23, 1993) was a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in 1950s and 1960s, one of the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot; pivotal in the civil rights movement.

==Education and career==

Born on December 10, 1909, in Funk, Nebraska, Brown received an Artium Baccalaureus degree in 1930 from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln and a Juris Doctor in 1932 from the University of Michigan Law School. Brown entered private practice in Houston and Galveston, Texas from 1932 to 1955, except for 1942 to 1946, when he served as a Major in the United States Army during World War II. He was employed at the law firm of Royston Rayzor and specialized in admiralty law.

==Federal judicial service==
Brown was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 25, 1955, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Robert Lee Russell. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 22, 1955, and received his commission on July 27, 1955. He served as Chief Judge and as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1967 to 1979. He assumed senior status on July 20, 1984. He was the last federal appeals court judge in active service to have been appointed to his position by President Eisenhower. His service terminated on January 23, 1993, due to his death in Houston.

===Fifth Circuit Four===
Brown became known as one of the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot;—Brown, Elbert Tuttle, Richard Rives, and John Minor Wisdom—so called because of a series of decisions crucial in advancing the civil rights of African-Americans. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (its jurisdiction as of 1981), but also Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and the Panama Canal Zone.

===Role in split of the old Fifth Circuit===
During his service as Chief Judge, Brown was crucial to the administrative actions splitting the new Eleventh Circuit (Alabama, Georgia and Florida) from the Old Fifth Circuit which included those states up to September 1981, leaving the current Fifth Circuit with Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.

==Honors==
The Judge John R. Brown Admiralty Moot Court Competition was established shortly before Brown&#x27;s death and is now held annually, sponsored by the University of Texas School of Law. The Judge Brown Admiralty Collection at the O&#x27;Quinn Law Library at the University of Houston Law Center is named in Brown&#x27;s honor.

<text>Richard Taylor Rives (January 15, 1895 – October 27, 1982) was an American lawyer and judge. A native of Alabama, he was the sole Democrat among the &quot;Fifth Circuit Four,&quot; four United States circuit judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in the 1950s and 1960s that issued a series of decisions crucial in advancing the civil and political rights of African-Americans. At that time, the Fifth Circuit included not only Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas (its current jurisdiction), but also Alabama, Georgia, and Florida (which were subsequently split off into the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit), and the Panama Canal Zone.

==Ancestry==
He is a descendant of Robert Ryves (Reve) of Dorset.

==Early and family life==

Born in Montgomery, Montgomery County, Alabama, on January 15, 1895, to William Henry Rives (1854-1922) and his wife, the former Alice Bloodworth Taylor (1856-1943), Rives had five siblings. A maternal great-great-grandfather had served as the first Baptist minister in Montgomery. Three of his great-great-great-great grandfathers had served in the American Revolutionary War: Captain William Sanford (1734-1806) had carried dispatches to France before settling in Georgia, Major John Mason (1716-1785) had acted as Justice of Sussex County, Virginia during that time, and Private James McLemore (1718-1800) had also served the Revolutionary cause in Granville County, North Carolina. Both sides of his family had operated large plantations using enslaved labor before the American Civil War.

Rives attended the public high school in Montgomery and graduated as valedictorian of his class. He then won a tuition scholarship and began studies at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. However, Rives also had to borrow money for living expenses from his sister, so he withdrew from the university after a year and began working for Wiley Hill, an attorney practicing in Montgomery whose family plantation had shared a border with the Rives&#x27; plantation before the American Civil War. Rives would later receive honorary degrees from the University of Notre Dame in 1966 and Cumberland Law School at Samford University in 1975.

==Early career, military service and family life==

After reading law, Rives passed the Alabama bar examination in 1914, although just 19 years old. He was in private practice in Montgomery, Alabama, from 1914 to 1916. During World War I, Rives joined the Alabama National Guard, then served in the United States Army (1916 to 1919; commissioned a first lieutenant in 1917). While stationed in Macon, Georgia, Rives met Jessie H. Daugherty. They married soon after he left the Army, and would have four children, although two died as infants. Rives&#x27;s relationship with his son and namesake Richard Rives Jr. (1922-1949) would later greatly affect his attitudes toward racial discrimination. His son had attended the University of Exeter in England and Harvard University in Massachusetts, then become severely ill while serving in the Pacific theater during World War II. Based on his own reading and discussions with African American soldiers hospitalized with him, the younger Rives determined to confront issues involved in what many Southerners called &quot;the race question.&quot; He also went to the University of Michigan Law school, advised his father to read Gunnar Myrdal&#x27;s treatise and planned to join the family law firm, but died in an auto accident in 1949. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1973, Rives in 1976 married Martha Blake Thigpen Frazer, but they had no children.

==Career==

In 1919 Rives returned to private practice in Montgomery after his World War I service, and became involved in politics and the Democratic Party during the New Deal. He directed the 1942 gubernatorial campaign of Bibb Graves, who died before the election. Rives served as president of both the Montgomery County and state bar associations. In 1951, he successfully appeared before the United States Supreme Court on behalf of the Alabama Public Service Commission, and the court reversed a lower federal court&#x27;s ruling that had allowed the Southern Railway Company to discontinue much local service in the state, deciding such was a state rather than federal matter. He was a close friend of United States Senator then Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black, as well as of Alabama Senators John Sparkman and Lister Hill. 

==Federal judicial service==

Rives was nominated by President Harry S. Truman on April 12, 1951, to a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated by Judge Leon Clarence McCord. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 1, 1951, and received his commission on May 3, 1951. He served as Chief Judge and as a member of the Judicial Conference of the United States from 1959 to 1960. He assumed senior status on February 15, 1966. Rives was reassigned by operation of law to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit on October 1, 1981, pursuant to 94 Stat. 1994. His service terminated on October 27, 1982, due to his death.

===Civil rights cases===

The Fifth Circuit supervised federal district judges in six southern states. By the time of the United States Supreme Court rulings concerning desegregation in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, the other &quot;Fifth Circuit Four&quot; judges had all been appointed by Republican President Dwight Eisenhower: Elbert P. Tuttle of Atlanta, Georgia, John Minor Wisdom of New Orleans, Louisiana, and John Robert Brown of Houston, Texas. All shared a quiet passion against injustice. Rives and his colleagues became actively involved in racial desegregation after state officials became involved in Massive Resistance. He also became involved in cases concerning bus desegregation, legislative redistricting and jury selection.

==Death and legacy==

Rives died at home in Montgomery, age 87 on October 27, 1982, after a long illness.

Rive&#x27;s granddaughter, United States District Judge Callie V. Granade, of the Southern District of Alabama. Granade struck down Alabama&#x27;s prohibition on same-sex marriage, a decision eventually affirmed by the United States Supreme Court.

<doc id="632258" wikidata="Q5479859" url="?curid=632258" title="Francine Patterson">
<text>Francine &quot;Penny&quot; Patterson (born February 13, 1947) is an American animal psychologist. From 1972 onwards, she taught a modified form of American Sign Language, which she called &quot;Gorilla Sign Language&quot; (GSL), to a gorilla named Koko. The scientific validity of Patterson&#x27;s claims about the extent of Koko&#x27;s language mastery has been widely rejected in linguistic and other specialist circles.

==Early life and education==
Patterson is the second oldest of seven children and daughter of C. H. Patterson, a professor of psychology, and Frances Spano Patterson. She was born in Chicago and moved with her family to Edina, Minnesota, when she was young, and then to Urbana, Illinois. Her mother died of cancer when Patterson was a freshman in college and the youngest of her siblings was just five years old. This triggered her interest in developmental psychology, a theme which pervaded much of her later work.

Patterson earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree in psychology at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1970. She attained her Ph.D. in 1979 from Stanford University, with her dissertation &quot;Linguistic Capabilities of a Lowland Gorilla&quot;, on teaching sign language to Koko and Michael, another Western lowland gorilla, who died in 2000.

==Career==

Patterson is the president and research director of The Gorilla Foundation. The foundation was founded with her longtime research colleague Ronald Cohn and Barbara F Hiller in 1978 using monetary support from a Rolex Award. The Gorilla Foundation had been trying to move from its current home in Woodside, California, to Maui, Hawaii. Patterson is an adjunct professor of psychology at Santa Clara University and a member of the Board of Consultants at the Center for Cross Cultural Communication in Washington, D.C. She is the Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;Gorilla&quot; journal.

Patterson and her work with Koko are the subject of Barbet Schroeder&#x27;s 1978 feature-length documentary &quot;&quot;. She is also an author of nonfiction works, including &quot;The Education of Koko&quot;, &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot;, &quot;Koko-Love!: Conversations With a Signing Gorilla&quot;, and &quot;Koko&#x27;s Story&quot;. All of these books deal with her personal experiences with Koko.
Patterson&#x27;s work has garnered controversy. Multiple allegations, made by former employees, said that she would routinely show her nipples to Koko and demand that other employees, both female and male, present their nipples to the gorilla. These demands never occurred with important donors. A sexual harassment lawsuit over this matter was settled out of court.

<doc id="632264" wikidata="Q1140514" url="?curid=632264" title="Provo (movement)">
<text>Provo was a Dutch counterculture movement in the mid-1960s that focused on provoking violent responses from authorities using non-violent bait. It was preceded by the nozem movement and followed by the hippie movement. Provo was founded, on 25 May 1965, by Robert Jasper Grootveld, an anti-smoking activist, and the anarchists Roel van Duijn and Rob Stolk. The term was used for the movement as a whole and for individual members. Provo was officially disbanded on 13 May 1967.

==Magazine==
12 July 1965 the first &quot;Provo&quot; magazine was published. It contained the &quot;Provo manifesto&quot;, written by Roel van Duijn, and reprinted recipes for bombs from a nineteenth-century anarchist pamphlet. The magazine was eventually confiscated.

In &quot;Provo&quot; #12, the magazine was described as

a monthly sheet for anarchists, provos, beatniks, pleiners, scissors-grinders, jailbirds, simple simon stylites, magicians, pacifists, potato-chip chaps, charlatans, philosophers, germ-carriers, grand masters of the queen&#x27;s horse, happeners, vegetarians, syndicalists, santy clauses, kindergarten teachers, agitators, pyromaniacs, assistant assistants, scratchers and syphilitics, secret police, and other riff-raff. Provo has something against capitalism, communism, fascism, bureaucracy, militarism, professionalism, dogmatism, and authoritarianism. Provo has to choose between desperation, resistance and submissive extinction. Provo calls for resistance wherever possible. Provo realises that it will lose in the end, but it cannot pass up the chance to make at least one more heartfelt attempt to provoke society. Provo regards anarchy as the inspirational source of resistance. Provo wants to revive anarchy and teach it to the young. Provo is an image.
==The White Plans==

The political wing of the Provos won a seat on the city council of Amsterdam, and developed the &quot;White Plans&quot;. The most famous of those is the &quot;White Bicycle Plan&quot;, which aimed to improve Amsterdam&#x27;s transport problem. Generally the plans sought to address social problems and make Amsterdam more liveable.

List of the White Plans:

* White Bicycle Plan: initiated by Luud Schimmelpenninck, the plan proposed the closing of central Amsterdam to all motorised traffic, including motorbikes, with the intention of improving public transport frequency by more than 40% and to save two million guilders per year. Taxis were accepted as semi-public transport, but would have to be electrically powered and have a maximum speed of 25 m.p.h. The Provos proposed one of the first bicycle sharing systems: the municipality would buy 20,000 white bikes per year, which were to be public property and free for everybody to use. After the plans were rejected by the city authorities, the Provos decided to go ahead anyway. They painted 50 bikes white and left them on streets for public use. The police impounded the bikes, as they violated municipal law forbidding citizens to leave bikes without locking them. After the bikes had been returned to the Provos, they equipped them all with combination locks and painted the combinations on the bicycles. (The song &quot;My White Bicycle&quot; by the English psychedelic rock band Tomorrow, later covered by Nazareth and by Nigel Planer, was inspired by the White Bicycle plan.)
* White Chimney Plan: proposed that air polluters be taxed and the chimneys of serious polluters be painted white.
* White Women Plan: proposed a network of clinics offering advice and contraceptives, mainly for the benefit of women and girls, and with the intention to reduce unwanted pregnancies. The plan was for girls of sixteen to be invited to visit the clinic, and advocated for schools to teach sex education. The White Women Plan also argued that it is irresponsible to enter marriage as a virgin.
* White Chicken Plan: a proposal for the reorganization of the Amsterdam police (called &quot;kip&quot; in Dutch slang, meaning &quot;chicken&quot;). Under the plan, the police would be disarmed and placed under the jurisdiction of the municipal council rather than the burgemeester (mayor). Municipalities would then be able to democratically elect their own chief of police. The Provos intended for this revised structure to transform the police from guard to social worker.
* White Housing Plan: sought to address Amsterdam&#x27;s acute housing problem by banning speculation in house building, and by promoting the squatting of empty buildings. The plan envisioned &quot;Waterlooplein&quot; as an open-air market and advocated abandoning plans for a new town hall.
* White Kids Plan: proposed shared parenting in groups of five couples. Parents would take turns to care for the group&#x27;s children on a different day of the week.
* White Victim Plan: proposed that anyone having caused death while driving would have to build a warning memorial on the site of the traffic collision by carving the victim&#x27;s outline one inch deep into the pavement and filling it with white mortar.
* White Car Plan: a car-sharing project proposed by &quot;Schimmelpennink&quot; featuring electric cars which could be used by the people. It was later realised in a limited fashion as the Witkar system from 1974 until 1986.

==End==
Tensions with the police peaked in June 1966, when the construction worker Jan Weggelaar died during a demonstration. A strike was called by construction workers and large numbers of workers and their sympathisers, including Provos, marched through Amsterdam. Demonstrators fought the police in the streets (on the Dam and Damrak) and attacked the offices and vehicles of &quot;De Telegraaf&quot;.

At the same time, the Provos participated in left-wing student protests against the Vietnam War. Demonstrations were banned, resulting in an increase in their size and popularity. The police responded with increasing force, and by mid-1966 hundreds of arrests were made every week. Police brutality led to increasing sympathy for the Provos and the anti-war demonstrators among the general public. An official investigation into the crisis was opened.

These events eventually led to the dismissal of Amsterdam&#x27;s police chief, H. J. van der Molen, in 1966 and the resignation of mayor Gijsbert van Hall in 1967. After van Hall had been removed, Grootveld and Rob Stolk (printer of &quot;Provo&quot; magazine) decided to end Provo. Stolk said:
&quot;Provo has to disappear because all the Great Men that made us big have gone&quot;, a reference to Provo&#x27;s two arch-enemies, Van Hall and Van der Molen.

==Influence==
Many Provo groups emerged in other cities in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and New York. Stockholm staged an anti-nuclear war happening/action under the name Provies. In London a &quot;Death and Rebirth of International Times&quot; happening, after a police raid of the first UK underground paper, was seen as a Provo event.

<doc id="632271" wikidata="Q267913" url="?curid=632271" title="Formatting Objects Processor">
<text>Formatting Objects Processor (FOP, also known as Apache FOP) is a Java application that converts XSL Formatting Objects (XSL-FO) files to PDF or other printable formats.
FOP was originally developed by James Tauber who donated it to the Apache Software Foundation in 1999. It is part of the Apache XML Graphics project.

FOP is open source software, and is distributed under the Apache License 2.0.

==Current status==
The latest version of Apache FOP is 2.10. This is the seventeenth stable release.

==Major limitations==
Most important elements added in XSL-FO 1.1 (flow maps, table markers, indexes. etc.) are not available 

In addition, older XSL-FO 1.0 features are still not fully supported including automatic table layout, floats and more.

==Input support==
Apache FOP supports embedding a number of image formats in the XSL-FO (through the codice_1 element). These include:

* SVG
* PNG
* Bitmap BMP
* PostScript (as EPS)
* JPEG
* Some TIFF formats.

Apache FOP implements the codice_2 element with some limitations. In versions prior to 2.0, external graphics objects were limited to being drawn inline or in a block with no wrapped text.

==Output formats==
Apache FOP supports the following output formats:

* PDF (best output support), including PDF/X and PDF/A with some limitations
* ASCII text file facsimile
* PostScript
* Direct printer output (PCL)
* AFP
* RTF
* Java2D/AWT for display, printing, and page rendering to PNG and TIFF

In progress:
*MIF
*SVG

<text>Ronald Herbert Cohn (November 11, 1943 – September 16, 2022) was an American zoologist who was a long-time research collaborator of psychologist Francine Patterson in her work in training Koko the gorilla in the use of American sign language. He documented much of Koko&#x27;s life on film and on camera, and is credited as the illustrator for the children&#x27;s books &quot;Koko&#x27;s Kitten&quot;, &quot;Koko-Love!: Conversations With a Signing Gorilla&quot;, and &quot;Koko&#x27;s Story&quot;. One of his photos of Koko was featured on the cover of &quot;National Geographic&quot; in 1978 and 1985.

At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, he received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1965, his master&#x27;s degree in zoology in 1967, and his Ph.D. in biology in 1971.

After receiving his PhD, Cohn worked as a cell biologist at the Stanford Departments of Medicine and Pediatrics. He did research in genetic engineering and membrane structure. He is credited with discovering that adult cells make hyaluronic acid from glucosamine, which led the way to glucosamine being used to treat arthritis.

Cohn co-founded The Gorilla Foundation with Patterson and Barbara F Hiller in 1971.

Cohn died at his home in Redwood City, California, on September 16, 2022, at the age of 78.

<doc id="632275" wikidata="Q523532" url="?curid=632275" title="Tapwave Zodiac">
<text>The Tapwave Zodiac is a mobile entertainment console and personal digital assistant. Tapwave announced the system in May 2003 and began shipping in October of that same year. The Zodiac was designed to be a high-performance mobile entertainment system centered on video games, music, photos, and video for 18- to 34-year-old gamers and technology enthusiasts. By running an enhanced version of the Palm Operating System (5.2T), Zodiac also provided access to Palm&#x27;s personal information management software and many other applications from the Palm developer community. The company was based in Mountain View, California.

The Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB) for US$299, and Zodiac 2 (128MB) for US$399. Some of the game titles for the product included &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; (Activision); &quot;Mototrax&quot; (Activision); &quot;SpyHunter&quot; (Midway); &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot; (EA/MDM); &quot;Doom II&quot; (id Software); &quot;Golden Axe III&quot; and &quot;Altered Beast&quot; (Sega); &quot;Warfare Incorporated&quot; (Handmark); and &quot;Duke Nukem Mobile&quot; (3D Realms/MachineWorks).

Due to insufficient funding and strong competitive pressure from the PlayStation Portable (PSP) from Sony (which was pre-announced at E3 on May 16, 2003, and shipped in North America on March 24, 2005), and the DS from Nintendo (released on November 21, 2004), Tapwave sold the company to an undisclosed multibillion-dollar corporation in Asia in July 2005.

The Zodiac console garnered strong product reviews and received many industry awards including &quot;Popular Science&quot;″s Best of What&#x27;s New Award, &quot;Stuff&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 10 Gadgets of the Year, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine&#x27;s Fetish Award, CNET&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Choice Award, &quot;PC World&quot;″s 2004 Next Gear Innovations Award; &quot;PC Magazine&quot;″s 1st Place Last Gadget Standing at CES; &quot;Handheld Computing&quot; magazine&#x27;s Most Innovative PDA of 2003; &quot;Time&quot; magazine Best Gear of 2003; and the &quot;Business Week&quot; Best Products of 2003.

==Primary features==
===Music, images, and video===
An MP3 music player is included in the system&#x27;s applications, and allows the creation of custom playlists using drag-and-dropping of files. MP3 music files can be played from either SD slot, or the internal memory of the device. MP3 files can also be used as alarms, along with conventional Palm OS alarms.

Photos (JPEG or PNG format) could be downloaded to the device using the Palm Desktop software or loaded onto SD cards, and could be shared and made into a slideshow (with background music) on the device.

The bundled video player on the device, Kinoma, would only play videos in a proprietary format, converted using the Kinoma Producer software (which supported conversion of MPEG1, MPEG4, QuickTime, AVI and DivX). The software however was limited in its conversion abilities, enticing users to pay for the full version. It has been suggested that this difficulty in converting video for the device diminished the Zodiac&#x27;s success. Several aftermarket DivX and XviD players have been developed (such as the TCPMP), and, at the time of bankruptcy, Tapwave were working on an update to supply MPEG-4 hardware decoding.

===Device design===
Due to the metal construction of the Zodiac, the device was seen to be more solid than other PDAs. However, on some models the adhesive on the shoulder buttons failed, and occasionally the screen was scratched by the screen cover when grit entered. Furthermore, due to the insecure clip holding the stylus, they could be knocked loose and potentially lost. Some alternative cases solved this problem with their own stylus holder.

===Compatibility===
The Zodiac is a Palm OS 5-compatible device, and most software compatible with Palm OS 5 runs without issue. In particular, most Palm OS 5-compatible games play on the Zodiac. Tapwave also provided proprietary APIs to allow developers to take advantage of the Zodiac&#x27;s graphics and sound hardware. A great deal of freeware and shareware games and emulators are therefore available. For example, there are versions of &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Hexen II&quot;, and &quot;Heretic&quot; as well as versions of emulators such as UAE, ScummVM, and LJZ/LJP, a multi-system emulator. There have also been attempts to emulate PlayStation games onto the Zodiac, the most successful emulator being PPSX. It is, however, nowhere near completion and many games are not playable yet.

===Battery===
The device has a total battery life of about 3 hours when using video, backlight+screen and CPU-intensive tasks, and while running as a dedicated audio player it is closer to 6 hours. The original battery was a 1500mAh Li-Ion; third party replacements with 2000mAh capacity are still available from some manufacturers.

===Software===
The Zodiac used a modified version of the Palm OS, designated version 5.2T. The main navigation menus consisted of 8 radially-arranged choices selected using either the touchscreen or thumbstick. It also came with the Palm OS Productivity Suite (containing a calendar, to do list etc.), an eBook reader, the Wordsmith word processor and the powerOne graphing application. It came bundled with two games, &quot;AcidSolitare&quot; (by Red Mercury) and &quot;Stunt Car Extreme&quot; (by Vasara Games).

===Models===
The Zodiac console was initially available in two models, Zodiac 1 (32MB), and Zodiac 2 (128MB). The Zodiac 2 was $100 more expensive than the original Zodiac.

==Games==

Games which utilized some or all of the Zodiac&#x27;s hardware/software are incompatible with standard Palm OS devices. This does exclude platforms outside of Palm OS (e.g., Doom II is also out for PC, but the Zodiac version listed here won&#x27;t run on standard Palm OS handhelds). This list also excludes standard Palm OS games which are also available for Zodiac handhelds, which were either identical or slightly improved on Zodiac, called &quot;Zodiac tuned&quot; (e.g. a game available for standard Palm OS only has the extra features of vibration and shoulder buttons as extra usable buttons when played on Zodiac).

Some of the games were never released due to the discontinuation of the Zodiac in July 2005. However, the testing builds of some of these games were leaked and are playable.

<doc id="632277" wikidata="Q225459" url="?curid=632277" title="Königsberg Cathedral">
<text>Königsberg Cathedral (; ) is a Brick Gothic-style monument in Kaliningrad, Russia, located on Kneiphof island in the Pregolya river. It is the most significant preserved building of the former city of Königsberg, which was largely destroyed in World War II.

Dedicated to the Virgin Mary and St. Adalbert of Prague, it was built as the see of the Prince-Bishops of Samland in the 14th century. Upon the establishment of the secular Duchy of Prussia, it became the Lutheran Albertina University church in 1544. The spire and roof of the cathedral burnt down after two RAF bombing raids in late August 1944; reconstruction started in 1992, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

==History==
===14th century to World War II===
A first smaller Catholic cathedral was erected in the Königsberg Altstadt between 1297 and 1302. After the Samland bishop Johann Clare had acquired the eastern part of Kneiphof island from the Teutonic Knights in 1322, he and his cathedral chapter had a new see built at the site and ensured its autonomy by a 1333 treaty with Grand Master Luther von Braunschweig.

The construction is considered to have begun about 1330. The original building in Altstadt was subsequently demolished and materials from it were used to build the new cathedral on Kneiphof. The soil on which the cathedral was built was marshy, and so hundreds of oak poles were put into the ground before the construction of the cathedral could begin. After a relatively short period of almost 50 years, the cathedral was largely completed by 1380, while works on the interior frescoes lasted until the end of the 14th century.

The choir contained murals from the 14th and 15th centuries, late Gothic wood carvings, and medieval monuments in the Renaissance style, the chief of which was a statue of Albert, Duke of Prussia, carved by Cornelis Floris de Vriendt in 1570.

The cathedral originally had two spires. The spires (one north and one south) overlooked the entrance (west side) of the cathedral. In 1544, the two spires were destroyed by fire. The south spire was rebuilt, but the north spire was replaced by a simple gable roof. In 1640, a clock was built underneath the rebuilt spire, and from 1650 the famous Wallenrodt Library, donated by Martin von Wallenrodt, was situated underneath the gable roof.

In 1695, an organ was installed in the cathedral. In the 19th century, the organ was restored and then renewed.

On 27 September 1523, Johann Briesmann gave the first Lutheran sermon in the cathedral. From then on, until 1945, the cathedral remained Protestant. Also Polish-language church services were held there from the 16th to the 18th century.

Albert, Duke of Prussia, and some of his relatives, as well as other dignitaries, were buried in the cathedral.

===Pre–World War II photos===
===World War II===
Königsberg was the capital of East Prussia from the Late Middle Ages until 1945, and the easternmost large German city until it was conquered by the Soviet Union near the end of World War II.

In late August 1944, British bombers carried out two-night raids on Königsberg. The first raid, on 26/27 August, largely missed the city, but the second raid, on 29/30, destroyed most of the old part of Königsberg (including Kneiphof), and the cathedral was hit. The part of the cathedral directly underneath the spire (today&#x27;s Lutheran chapel) is where 20 to 25 citizens of Königsberg survived during the second air raid. During reconstruction in 1992, hundreds of skeletons, mostly of children, were discovered under tons of rubble in that area. These were German children murdered by Soviet troops in 1945.

===Post–World War II===

After the war, the cathedral remained a burnt-out shell and Kneiphof was made into a park with no other buildings. Before the war, Kneiphof had many buildings. One of the buildings was the first Albertina University building, where Immanuel Kant taught, which was situated next to the east side of the cathedral. New construction nearby includes the House of Soviets.

Shortly after Kaliningrad was opened to foreigners in the early 1990s after the fall of the Soviet Union, work began to reconstruct the cathedral. In 1994, a new spire was put in place using a helicopter. In 1995, a new clock was put in place. The clock has four bells (1,180 kg, 700 kg, 500 kg &amp; 200 kg), all cast in 1995. The clock chimes every quarter of an hour. On the hour, the clock chimes by playing the first notes of Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5, followed by monotonic chiming to indicate the hour. Between 1996 and 1998, work was done to construct the roof. Work was also done to put in stained glass windows.

One problem during the reconstruction was the subsidence of the cathedral which had happened over time. Even during German times, the subsidence had been evident.

In 2007–2008, a marble epitaph of 17th-century Polish princely magnate Bogusław Radziwiłł and his wife Anna Maria was renovated with funds from the Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage.

Today, the cathedral has two chapels—one Lutheran, the other Russian Orthodox—as well as a museum. The cathedral is also used for concerts.
==Kant&#x27;s tomb==
The tomb of the philosopher Immanuel Kant, the &quot;Sage of Königsberg&quot;, is today in a mausoleum adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral. The mausoleum was constructed by the architect Friedrich Lahrs and was finished in 1924 in time for the bicentenary of Kant&#x27;s birth. Originally, Kant was buried inside the cathedral, but in 1880 his remains were moved outside and placed in a neo-Gothic chapel adjoining the northeast corner of the cathedral. Over the years, the chapel became dilapidated before it was demolished to make way for the mausoleum, which was built on the same spot, where it is today.

On 27 November 2018, Kant&#x27;s tomb and statue near Immanuel Kant Baltic Federal University were vandalised with pink paint by unknown assailants, who also scattered leaflets glorifying Rus&#x27; and denouncing him as a &quot;traitor&quot;. The incident was apparently connected with a vote to rename Khrabrovo Airport, where Kant was in the lead for a while, prompting Russian nationalist resentment.

<doc id="632302" wikidata="Q3087188" url="?curid=632302" title="Frederick Ogilvie">
<text>Sir Frederick Wolff Ogilvie FRSE (7 February 1893 – 10 June 1949) was a British broadcasting executive and university administrator, who was Director-General of the BBC from 19 July 1938 to 26 January 1942, and was succeeded by joint Directors-General Cecil Graves and Robert Foot. He also served as Vice-Chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast from 1934 to 1938. He was knighted by King George VI on 10 June 1942.

==Early life and education==
Ogilvie was born in February 1893 in Valparaíso, Chile, the youngest son of Mary Ann (née Wolff) and William Maxwell Ogilvie, an engineer from Harrow Weald in northwest London. His parents were of Scottish descent. Ogilvie was educated at Packwood Haugh School and Clifton College, before beginning studying for a Literae humaniores degree at Balliol College, Oxford in 1911. From the beginning of his undergraduate studies, he displayed an interest in economics.

Having gained first class in his Honour Moderations exams, Ogilvie&#x27;s studies were interrupted by the start of the First World War. He enrolled in the army two days after the announcement of war, joining as a second lieutenant in the 4th Bedfordshire Regiment. Posted to France, he sustained serious injuries in the Battle of Hill 60 in April 1915, losing his left arm. Despite his injury, he continued in military service, rising to the rank of captain by the time of his demobilization in 1919. He returned to Balliol and completed a modified version of his degree.

==Career==

===Academics===
In the autumn term of 1919, he was appointed as an economics lecturer at Trinity College, Oxford, becoming a fellow of the college the following year. In 1926, he was appointed Chair of Political Economy at the Management School of Economics at Edinburgh University. He later acted as an economic advisor to a group of Conservative MPs.

In 1929 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Sir Edmund Taylor Whittaker, Ralph Allan Sampson, Adam Mitchell Hunter and John Edwin MacKenzie.

Ogilvie was one of the first British economists to recognise the significance of tourism. He wrote on this subject in his book &quot;The Tourist Movement&quot; (1933), outlining how more expenditure on tourism could bring about faster growth in that area. He also contributed articles on economics and tourism to Chambers&#x27;s Encyclopaedia. His other academic writings included contributions to the &quot;Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, as well as journals such as &quot;The Economic Journal&quot;, &quot;The Scottish Historical Review&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;.

Alongside his interest in tourism, Ogilvie had a concern for Scottish economic matters. He was a member of the chamber of commerce in Edinburgh, as well as other trade organisations from 1927, and in the 1930s was a government advisor on issues relating to youth unemployment and adult education. Between 1932 and 1934, he was a member of the governing body for Edinburgh University.

In 1934, he became vice-chancellor of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, where he also served as Professor of Political Economy. He continued at the university for four years.

===Broadcasting===
Ogilvie became the second Director-General of the BBC in 1938, following John Reith, who had been instrumental in the early development of the corporation. He served in this position until early 1942, but made little impact at the BBC, although an exception was recruiting Lindley Fraser to head the BBC&#x27;s German service, where Fraser developed a large German audience throughout the war. Historian Asa Briggs described Ogilvie&#x27;s period in office as &quot;short, stormy and in some ways calamitous&quot;. R. C. Norman, who was chair of the BBC when Ogilvie was appointed, later described him as having every ability &quot;except that of being able to manage a large organization, the one quality which was indispensable&quot;. Ogilvie resigned in 1942, and received a knighthood the same year.

===Later life and death===
Between 1943 and 1945, Ogilvie worked for the British Council. In 1944, he considered becoming the editor for a national newspaper, but instead became principal of Jesus College, Oxford. He made a much greater mark in this role than at the BBC, being able to draw on his experience and personal contacts to further the growth of the college. From 1945, he became the chair of the Tin Box Wages Council, which had been set up to regulate wages within the tin box industry. He continued in both of these roles until his death in 1949 in London. Queen&#x27;s University named one of its blocks of student accommodation after him.

==Personal life==
Ogilvie had an interest in music from his childhood and became significantly involved in the Oxford Bach Choir, of which he spent some time as chairman of the committee. He also had a passion for outdoor pursuits.

In 1922, he married Mary Helen Macaulay, the daughter of Alexander Beith Macaulay, who was professor of apologetics and systematic theology at Trinity College, Glasgow. They had three sons. The oldest James Willam, was killed in an accident while climbing the Matterhorn. Another, Robert Maxwell Ogilvie, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, becoming a fellow of Balliol College in 1957.

Four years after his death, Lady Ogilvie became principal of St Anne&#x27;s College, Oxford. She died in 1990, aged 90.

<text>Alison Louise Kennedy (born 22 October 1965) is a Scots writer, academic and stand-up comedian. She writes novels, short stories and non-fiction, and is known for her dark tone and her blending of realism and fantasy. She contributes columns and reviews to European newspapers.

==Biography==
Kennedy was born in Dundee to Edwardene Mildred, a teacher, and Robert Alan Kennedy, a psychology lecturer. Her parents divorced when she was 13. She attended the fee-paying High School of Dundee and went on to study for a BA Hons in Theatre Studies and Dramatic Arts at the University of Warwick.

From 1987 to 1989, Kennedy was a community arts worker for Clydebank District Council. She then went on to a role as writer-in-residence for Hamilton and East Kilbride Social Work Department from 1989 to 1991. Her work there won a special Social Work Today Award in 1990. From 1989 to 1995 she worked on Project Ability, a Glasgow-based visual arts organisation. In 1995 she was a part-time lecturer at the University of Copenhagen.

In 2009, she donated the short story &quot;Vanish&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, four collections of stories written by 38 authors. Her story was published in the &quot;Air&quot; collection. In 2016, her novel &quot;Serious Sweet&quot; was long-listed for the Booker Prize.

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, she signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

In 2020 she began contributing a column on her views of Brexit to the German daily paper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot;.

Kennedy currently lives in the Scottish Highlands, having moved from Wivenhoe and has been an associate professor in Creative Writing at the University of Warwick since 2007, having previously taught creative writing at the University of St Andrews from 2003 to 2007.

<text>Captain Sir Cecil George Graves (4 March 1892 – 12 January 1957) was joint Director-General of the BBC with Robert Foot from 26 January 1942 to 6 September 1943.

==Early life==
The son of Charles L. Graves and Alice Grey, the eldest sister of Viscount Grey of Fallodon, Graves was educated at Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt, (like his predecessor Reith) and then at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

==Career==
Graves was a scout commissioned into the Royal Scots from Sandhurst in 1911. He served with the British Expeditionary Force in France, from August 1914, and was one of the first to be taken as a prisoner of war, on 26 August 1914, spending the rest of the Great War in a German prison camp. After the war, he served at the War Office in the Intelligence Branch of the Imperial General Staff from 1919 to 1925, when he left the British Army.
He joined the BBC as an administrator in 1926, was Assistant Director of Programmes from 1929 to 1932, then Empire Service Director, 1932–1935, Controller of Programmes, 1935–1938, Deputy Director-General, 1938–1942, and in 1942 succeeded Frederick Ogilvie (jointly with Robert Foot) as Director-General. Graves retired from the corporation in September 1943 due to ill health, leaving Foot to be sole Director-General. Graves was also a member of the Arts Council of Great Britain and the Broadcasting Council of Scotland (now known as Audience Council Scotland).

==Family==
In 1921, Graves married Irene Helen Bagnell, a daughter of H. W. J. Bagnell, of the Indian Civil Service, and they had two sons. The eldest, Michael, was an RAF Spitfire Squadron leader who took part in the battle of Malta in which he was awarded a DFC. He fought in the D Day invasion and took part in the first ever flight of operational jets. After the war he was a jet pilot for Rolls-Royce and then Westland of Yeovil. In 1949 Michael was killed aged 28 while test flying a Wyvern.

==Honours==
*Military Cross
*Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, 1939
*Grand Officer of the Order of Orange Nassau, Netherlands

<doc id="632312" wikidata="Q15891674" url="?curid=632312" title="Storm cellar">
<text>A storm shelter or storm cellar is a type of underground bunker designed to protect the occupants from severe weather, particularly tornadoes. They are most frequently seen in the Midwest (&quot;Tornado Alley&quot;) and Southeastern (&quot;Dixie Alley&quot;) United States where tornadoes are generally frequent and the low water table permits underground livings.

==Average storm shelter==
An average storm cellar for a single family is built close enough to the home to allow instant access in an emergency, but not so close that the house could tumble on the door during a storm, trapping the occupants inside. This is also the reason the main door on most storm cellars is mounted at an angle rather than perpendicular with the ground. An angled door allows for debris to blow up and over the door, or sand to slide off, without blocking it, and the angle also reduces the force necessary to open the door if rubble has piled up on top. The floor area is generally around , with an arched roof like that of a Quonset hut, but entirely underground. In most cases the entire structure is built of blocks faced with cement and rebar through the bricks for protection from the storm. Doing so makes it nearly impossible for the bricks to collapse. New ones are sometimes made of septic tanks that have been modified with a steel door and vents. Some new shelters are rotationally molded from polyethylene.

Most storm cellars are accessible by a covered stairwell, and at the opposite end of the structure there can be conduits for air that reach the surface, and perhaps a small window to serve as an emergency exit and also to provide some light. Storm cellars, when connected to the house, may potentially compromise security.

Fully enclosed underground storm shelters offer superior tornado protection to that of a traditional basement (cellar) because they provide separate overhead cover without the risk of occupants being trapped or killed by collapsing rubble from above. For this reason they also provide the only reliable form of shelter against &quot;violent&quot; (EF4 and EF5) tornadoes which tend to rip the house from its foundation, removing the overhead cover which was protecting the occupant.

There are several different styles of storm cellars. There are the generic underground storm/tornado cellar, also called storm or tornado shelters, as well as the new above-ground safe rooms. A &quot;cellar&quot; is an underground unit, but for the sake of the specified use of a &quot;storm cellar&quot; to protect one from high-wind storms, it seems relevant to mention saferooms. There are two basic styles of underground storm cellars. One is the &quot;hillside&quot; or &quot;embankment&quot; and the other is the &quot;flat&quot; ground.

One other style of shelter is the under garage. While similar to other underground shelters, its main difference is that it is installed in a garage rather than outside. Having it installed in the garage allows access to it without having to go outside during a storm. It is sometimes not an option to have a shelter installed outside either due to insufficient space, or local ordinances.

=== Hillside/embankment shelters ===
Hillside or embankment models are usually installed in one of two ways. It can be installed in an existing hill/embankment or dirt is built up around a freestanding unit, forming a hill around it. The door can be set at an angle or vertically. There can be steps leading into the unit, or it can be installed to where the floor is level with the ground outside. The embankment storm cellar can be made from concrete, steel, fiberglass, or any other structurally sound material or composite and is usually installed in a hill or embankment, leaving only the door exposed. In some situations, they can hold an entire neighborhood or town as with a community shelter. More often, they are built to hold one or two families, specified as a residential shelter. All underground &quot;storm or tornado&quot; shelters must be properly anchored.

=== Above ground shelters ===
Above ground shelters are used in many areas of the country and by a wide variety of homeowners and businesses. Groundwater tables may make it impossible to install or build a shelter below ground, elderly or people with limited mobility may be unable to access a below ground shelter, or people may have significant phobias pertaining to below ground sheltering. FEMA P-320, Taking Shelter from the Storm: Building a Safe Room for Your Home or Small Business (2014) and ICC/NSSA Standard for the Design and Construction of Storm Shelters provide engineering and testing requirements to ensure that above ground shelters manufactured to the published specifications will withstand winds in excess of (EF5 tornado). Above ground shelters may be built of different materials such as steel reinforced concrete or 1/8&quot; 10 ga. hot rolled steel and may be installed inside a home, garage, or outbuilding, or as a stand-alone unit. These types of shelters are typically prefabricated and installed on a home site or commercial location. Walls can be provided which form a deflector baffle entry so that the path of the storm debris must touch two impact resistant surfaces before it penetrates into the protected area of the occupants.

Wind engineering specialists from Texas Tech University&#x27;s National Wind Institute have done extensive research that concludes that sheltering in an above ground storm shelter that meets the engineering criteria outlined in FEMA Pub. 320 and 361 and ICC/NSSA Standard for the Design and Construction of Storm Shelters is as safe as seeking below ground shelter during massive EF4 and EF5 tornadoes. TTU engineer Joseph Dannemiller presented the research findings at a TEDxTexasTechUniversity symposium in February 2014.

===Below-ground shelters ===
The below-ground shelters are designed so that the door is flat with the ground and can be made from any one of the materials previously described. This unit is put in a hole deep enough to cover the bottom section, and then the excavated dirt is filled in around the top and packed down. Storm shelters must be designed, built, tested, and installed properly for them to meet any of the US FEMA-320, FEMA-361, ICC-500, NPCTS (National Performance Criteria for Tornado Shelters), or ICC/NSSA Standards.

=== Geolocation services ===
Many storm shelter manufacturers include geolocation services or incorporate GPS technologies to assist in ensuring recovery from the shelter after a storm or other catastrophic event. In addition, shelter owners may opt to incorporate their own geolocation services in their shelter. Shelter owners can provide their shelter&#x27;s GPS coordinates to an emergency response center that is linked to a nationwide severe weather notification system. If a storm occurs, the emergency response center places a phone call to the shelter owner and then secondary contacts, lastly contacting local emergency response if unable to contact the shelter owner.

==Additional uses==

Functionally underground bunkers, storm cellars are readily provisioned as bomb shelters and/or fallout shelters (although they are not usually dug as deeply or equipped with filtered ventilation, respectively). Too, since their underground construction makes them steadily cool and dark, storm cellars on farmsteads in the Midwest and elsewhere have traditionally used as root cellars to store seasonal canned goods for consumption during the winter.

<text>Robert William Foot (7 June 1889 – 2 April 1973) was Director-General of the BBC, first jointly with Cecil Graves from 26 January 1942 to 6 September 1943 and then solely until he resigned on 31 March 1944. Before joining the BBC, Foot was a general manager at Gas Light and Coke Company. After being succeeded by William Haley, he became Chairman of the Mining Association.

==Life and career==
Foot was born in 1889 and educated at Winchester College. He started his career in 1912 as a solicitor in Calcutta, India, working for the firm of Orr, Dignam and Company. During the First World War, he served in Belgium and France with the Royal Field Artillery. He was mentioned in dispatches on two occasions, and later received an OBE and Military Cross for his service.

In 1919, he began working for the Gas Light and Coke Company, appointed by David Milne Watson. From 1928 to 1941, he held the position of General Manager.

During the Second World War, he acted as a government advisor on organisation within the BBC. In 1942, he was appointed joint Director-General with Cecil Graves. The following year, Graves retired due to poor health, and Foot served as sole Director-General. He was not well-suited to the role and left the post in 1944.

Succeeded by William Haley, Foot became chairman of the Mining Association of Great Britain. He also later served as president of the British Coal Utilisation Research Association. Foot believed that nationalization was a bad idea. During his tenure at the Mining Association, he visited many mines personally to better understand miners&#x27; issues. In 1945, he published &quot;A Plan for Coal&quot;.

In 1947, he was promoted to President of the Mining Association, a position he held until 1952. He also served as the chairman for Powell Duffryn Technical Services and Wankie Colliery Company, and director of Barclays and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group. After a short time in South Africa, Foot retired in England. He was a member of the court of assistance of the Worshipful Company of Haberdashers. He died aged 83 in Whitehanger Nursing Home, Haslemere, Surrey in 1973. He was married, with two sons and one daughter.

<text>Marie Firmin Bocourt (19 April 1819 – 4 February 1904) was a French zoologist and artist.

As a young man, he worked as a preparateur for the zoologist Gabriel Bibron (1805–1848), later serving as a museum artist. In 1861, he was sent to Thailand (then called Siam), where he explored the fauna and brought back an important collection of specimens.

He collaborated with Auguste Duméril (1812–1870) on a series called &quot;Mission scientifique au Mexique et dans l&#x27;Amérique Centrale&quot;, a result of Bocourt&#x27;s scientific expedition to Mexico and Central America in 1864–1866, in one part during the French Intervention in Mexico led by Napoleon III. Auguste Duméril died in 1870, and the project was continued by Bocourt with assistance from Léon Vaillant (1834–1914), François Mocquard (1834–1917) and Fernand Angel (1881–1950). With Vaillant, he published a study on fishes, &quot;&quot;Études sur les poissons&quot; &quot;, that was included in &quot;Mission scientifique au Mexique et dans l&#x27;Amérique Centrale&quot;.

As an artist, he specialized in engravings, doing portraits of contemporary people as well as zoological illustrations.
==Taxa named in honor of Bocourt==

<text>The SAMOS (misidentified as Satellite and Missile Observation System) or SAMOS-E program was a relatively short-lived series of reconnaissance satellites for the United States in the early 1960s, also used as a cover for the initial development of the KH-7 GAMBIT system. Reconnaissance was performed with film cameras and television surveillance from polar low Earth orbits with film canister returns and transmittals over the United States. SAMOS was first launched in 1960 from Vandenberg Air Force Base.

SAMOS was also known by the unclassified terms Program 101 and Program 201.

== History ==
=== Background ===

==== WS-117L and costs ====
SAMOS started as part of the WS-117L satellite reconnaissance and protection program of the United States Air Force in 1956. In May 1958, the Department of Defense directed the transfer of the WS-117L program to ARPA. Significant parts of the SAMOS development program were SAMOS-E (optical reconnaissance), SAMOS-F (ELINT Ferret reconnaissance).

In FY1958, WS-117L was funded by the Air Force at a level of US$ 108.2 million (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ). For SAMOS, USAF, and ARPA spent a combined sum of US$82.9 million in FY1959 (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ) and US$163.9 million in FY1960 (inflation adjusted US$ billion in ).

==== CORONA and SAMOS ====

During this period, the rival CORONA program, which saw its first launch in February 1959, began operation. SAMOS emerged as a more advanced satellite with additional capabilities that due to its larger mass would be launched on the Atlas-Agena booster instead of the Thor-Agena. While CORONA took photographs and returned them to Earth in a film capsule, SAMOS would instead electronically scan its film and beam images down by radio link.

While CORONA began flying in 1959, the reliability of the program for its first three years was abysmal and a backup reconnaissance program was needed. Moreover, the fear of the &quot;missile gap&quot; with the Soviet Union was very great, with space successes and boasts by Soviet politicians seeming to hint that the USSR not only had a large arsenal of nuclear missiles on hand, but were quite willing to use them. The US ballistic missile arsenal in 1960 consisted of a handful of Atlas ICBMs that were exposed to Soviet attack, took a long time to prepare for launch, and whose test flight record did not inspire much confidence. The Thor and Jupiter IRBMs stationed in the UK, Italy, and Turkey were not much of an improvement, also their bases could be attacked by Soviet bombers. Intelligence on Soviet missile activities was considered vital, but the only viable option, U-2 reconnaissance flights, had been halted by the Gary Powers shootdown in May 1960. Unbeknownst to the Pentagon, Soviet missiles were deployed in far smaller numbers than generally believed and their reliability was no better than any US missile. The initial SAMOS satellites were known as Program 101 and were merely a test model designed to verify the operability of the photo-optical camera system.

==== Name and secrecy ====
&quot;Samos&quot; was the name of a Greek island and the name was picked with the belief that nobody would associate it with reconnaissance. However, a mistaken rumor later emerged that the name was an acronym for &quot;Satellite And Missile Observation System&quot;. President Eisenhower was adamant about cultivating the image that the US space program was only for peaceful purposes. The Air Force for a while managed to create the fiction that Discoverer was a series of scientific satellites, but SAMOS&#x27;s real purpose was known from the beginning, and efforts to not link it to Discoverer were made. Although the existence and mission purpose of SAMOS was publicly acknowledged until the fall of 1961, the Air Force did not release detailed information about the satellites or exactly what they were doing during their missions.

=== SAMOS 1 ===

SAMOS 1 launch took place from PALC 1-1 (Point Arguello Launch Complex - later absorbed into the main launch center at Vandenberg Air Force Base) at 20:34 GMT on 11 October 1960, using Atlas LV-3 Agena-A vehicle 57D and Agena 2101. The Atlas lifted smoothly and steered downrange, as the weather was clear and cloudless, visibility was excellent and the launch vehicle could be seen until after booster section separation. Initial jubilation at the successful launch turned to dismay when the real-time telemetry readouts showed that the nitrogen pressure gas for the Agena-A&#x27;s attitude control jets was gone. Without this, the stage could not be stabilized for ignition so that after separation from the Atlas, the Agena-A was left with no attitude control. Telemetry indicated an erratic attitude rate and abnormal gimbaling of the Bell XLR-81 engine. The Agena-A burn lasted 123 seconds, slightly longer than nominal, but tracking stations in VAFB, Kodiak Island, and Hawaii found no indication that orbit had been achieved, and it was concluded that the vehicle had reentered and broken up over an unknown point in the Pacific Ocean. The postflight analysis also found that the Atlas guidance system had malfunctioned in flight, due to either a failure of the rate beacon or waveguide antenna, but the guidance system was not telemetered so an exact cause could not be determined. The guidance system was unable to generate any steering or programmed engine cutoff commands, however, backup signals from the missile programmer managed to ensure a proper flight path and on-time engine cutoff. The Agena-A malfunction was traced to a technician installing a pad umbilical release lanyard improperly, which resulted in the Agena-A nitrogen quick fill line being ripped out at liftoff. Film and photographs of the launch clearly showed the gas escaping. At Agena engine ignition, the performance was also below normal, suggesting damage to the pneumatic system as well.

The major objective of the SAMOS 1 mission was to determine the engineering feasibility of obtaining ground observation capability from an orbiting satellite. It launched on 11 October 1960 at 20:34 GMT from the Pacific Missile Range in Point Arguello, California. The first stage separated at 249.9 seconds after liftoff. The Agena-A second stage ignited at 506.7 seconds and cutoff at 629.3 seconds, as planned, but a loss of nitrogen gas pressure had disrupted the guidance and control systems at 123 seconds, resulting in poor trajectory and failure to orbit the payload. Tracking telemetry was lost prior to the Agena-A ignition, so the exact trajectory was unknown. SAMOS 1 was the first satellite in the series SAMOS launched by the US Air Force from Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard an Atlas Agena-A rocket. It was a first-generation photo surveillance satellite intended to radio relay images back to Earth but loss of nitrogen gas pressure disrupted the guidance and control systems, causing a second stage failure. No data were returned. The payload comprised photographic and related test equipment, telemetry, radiation, tracking, and command instrumentation. The payload was housed in the Agena second stage. The entire stage was designed to go into orbit. The stage, including payload and casing, had a planned orbital mass of 1,845 kg. It was a 6.7 meter high, 1.5-meter diameter cylinder. The first stage was a modified Atlas ICBM. The full rocket was 30.2 m high with a base diameter of 3.05 m and a liftoff mass of approximately 124 000 kg.

=== SAMOS 2 ===
SAMOS 2 was launched on 31 January 1961, on Atlas 70D and Agena 2102. Unlike with SAMOS 1, the weather was foggy and gray, and the pad was not even visible from the blockhouse. This time, everything worked perfectly and SAMOS 2 achieved orbit. The F-1 ferret system was tested first, followed by the E-1 electro-optical cameras, which transmitted images of approximately 30.5 m of resolution. On-orbit 21, ground controllers sent the command to jettison the F-1 antenna, which was partially obstructing the camera, in the hopes of even better images. However, something went disastrously wrong when all telemetry signals from SAMOS 2 ceased. It was believed that the separation mechanism for the F-1 antenna had caused the partial or complete disintegration of the satellite vehicle. SAMOS 2 remained in orbit until it decayed into the atmosphere on 21 October 1971.

SAMOS 2 was launched from the Pacific Missile Range at 20:24:00 GMT, into a near-circular polar orbit of 474 x 557 km, 94.97 min of revolution, and 97.4° of inclination, to determine the capability for making observations of space, the atmosphere, and the nature of the globe from satellites. The 1 860 kg spacecraft was a cylinder 6.7 m long and 1.5 m in diameter, and it comprised the entire Agena-A second stage. Included in the instrumentation were photographic and associated test equipment, acoustical (Microphone Density Gauge) micrometeorite detection apparatus, a plasma probe, and an electric field meter. The computer on board was digital-to-analog. Telemetry, tracking, and command equipment completed the payload. Details about the satellite&#x27;s transmitter were not announced. A conical nose cap detached from the satellite casing and remained in orbit. The expected lifetime of the satellite was 15 years, and the expected lifetime of the nose cap was 12 years.

The next attempt did not take place for seven months, because of the switch to the larger Agena-B second stage that could be restarted in orbit and the operational Program 101A satellites, which had a more advanced camera system with better resolution and a wider field of view. SAMOS satellites after SAMOS 2 also sported a large &quot;mushroom cap&quot; nose cone, as early plans had envisioned flying a crewed capsule similar to Project Mercury.

=== SAMOS 3 ===

The SAMOS 3 launch was a complete disaster. SAMOS 3 lifted from PALC 1-1 on 9 September 1961 at 00:00:00 GMT, was a US Air Force first-generation photo surveillance satellite with 7 instruments on board but the Atlas LV-3 Agena-B booster&#x27;s engines shut down after the rocket had ascended about 29 cm and it fell back onto the pad in an enormous fireball. Postflight investigation found that an umbilical on PALC 1-1 had not detached on time, resulting in the booster being switched from internal to external power, but since the power umbilicals on the pad had already detached, the result was a complete loss of electrical power to all Atlas systems. The accident necessitated improved procedures to umbilical lanyard installation, and modifications to the launcher system to prevent the hold-down arms from releasing the launch vehicle until all umbilicals had detached.

After SAMOS 3, it was decided to abandon the Program 101/101A satellites entirely and switch to a more conventional film recovery capsule, since the one successful mission had not proven the viability of the electro-optical camera system. While the 101/101A satellites separated from the Agena-B in orbit, the 101B would remain attached and would use it for orbital maneuvers and also deorbiting the film capsule at the end of the mission.

Several more 101/101A satellites were either completed or in a state of partial completion when the program was called off, but the problem of how to dispose of them was never satisfactorily solved. Most were left mothballed in warehouses or scrapped. There was talk of giving the camera systems to NASA for the planetary probe program, but they were of doubtful value for taking photographs of the Moon. The Agena stages that could not be repurposed for other programs were scrapped.

The 101B satellites were originally intended to use an encrypted communications system out of paranoia that the Soviets could not only intercept transmissions, but even reprogram the satellite to land on their territory. Unlike CORONA, the 101B satellites would land with the complete camera system, not just the film capsule, and the Pentagon and State Department dreaded the consequences of a landing on Soviet territory. Ultimately, the encrypted communication requirement was dropped in October 1961, a mere month before the first 101B satellite launched.

As it turned out, PALC 1-1 was not seriously damaged by the explosion of SAMOS 3&#x27;s booster and repair work only consisted of plumbing and electrical equipment, replacing the launcher mechanism, and cleaning and repainting. By 29 October, the pad was fully restored to working condition.

=== SAMOS 4 ===

On 22 November 1961 at 00:00:00 GMT, SAMOS 4, the first Program 101B satellite, was a US Air Force first-generation photo surveillance satellite, lifted off. Extensive efforts were made to ensure mission success, such as X-ray testing for bad transistors and super-clean propellant tanks. Unfortunately, the launch was another failure, albeit less dramatic than SAMOS 3. The Atlas suffered a guidance malfunction at T+245 seconds into launch that resulted in loss of pitch control, as well as improper booster and sustainer cutoff signals. Booster jettison happened a few seconds early, while the sustainer engine burned to LOX depletion. The booster pitched up about 160° at SECO, leaving the Agena oriented in the wrong direction for orbital insertion, so when its engine fired, it drove SAMOS 4 into the Pacific Ocean instead of orbit.

It was believed that the improper pitch signals on SAMOS 4&#x27;s launch vehicle had been caused by the accidental separation of a heat shield covering the retrorockets on the Atlas equipment pods. This would have caused aerodynamic heating of the pitch gyro, and the failure was extremely similar to an incident that occurred during the launch of MIDAS 4 a month earlier, and it led to redesigned heat shields over the retrorockets. The guidance system tracking beacon had also failed in flight, causing the absence of programmed BECO/SECO commands.

SAMOS 4 was the first fully top-secret DoD space mission, as President Kennedy had issued an executive order putting all DoD space programs under strict secrecy. The Air Force announcement said nothing other than that a satellite had been launched on 22 November from PALC 1-1 on an Atlas-Agena B vehicle. SAMOS 4&#x27;s failure to orbit also went unannounced, although since the Air Force never confirmed that it reached orbit, space program observers quickly guessed that the launch was not a success.

The next two Program 101B satellites contained several technical improvements, such as more sophisticated telemetry and control/communications systems and improved cameras.

=== SAMOS 5 ===

SAMOS 5 was launched on 22 December 1961 at 19:12:00 GMT, was a first-generation, low-resolution photo surveillance spacecraft, once again with nothing but a brief statement by the Air Force about a launch taking place aboard an Atlas-Agena B from PALC 1-1. Space program observers noted that this time around, the Air Force statement did report the satellite as having attained orbit. Indeed, it did, but the Atlas malfunctioned yet again. This time, the sustainer engine did not cut off on schedule and continued operating until LOX depletion, putting the satellite into a high orbit, which resulted in the deorbit maneuver failing (although given that reentry would have taken place over densely-populated New England, this was not necessarily a bad thing). The reentry command had activated all systems in the satellite, quickly draining the batteries. With the loss of electrical power, the parachutes could not be deployed during reentry, and also since the retrorockets had been expended during the failed deorbit maneuver, SAMOS 5 would only leave orbit once it decayed naturally. Without the parachutes or retrorockets, the capsule&#x27;s descent would be far too fast for air recovery to be possible, but it could still easily survive reentry and land almost anywhere. The spent Agena-B stage reentered over Indonesia on 31 December, and it was calculated that reentry of the satellite itself would happen on 6 January 1962.

When 6 January 1962 came, the indications were that SAMOS 5 impacted somewhere in northwestern Canada. A US Air Force search party attempted to obtain Canadian permission to search the suspected area, but were unable to explain exactly what they were looking for. The Canadian authorities were suspicious that a B-52 aircraft had accidentally lost a nuclear warhead somewhere, and since this was not an easily resolved matter, the search was called off. Later on, a pair of U-2 reconnaissance aircraft searched the suspected area, but failed to locate any satellite debris.

=== SAMOS 6 ===

SAMOS 6 was launched on 7 March 1962 at 19:12:00 GMT, finally had no booster problems, in part due to modifications made to the Agena-B after lessons learned from previous missions, but a series of erroneous ground commands caused the satellite to deplete its attitude control gas. When the Agena stage fired for the deorbit maneuver, SAMOS 6 was launched into a high orbit. In July 1963, fifteen months later, the satellite was on the verge of reentry. With the electrical system dead for months, there was again no chance of an air recovery of the capsule, but it could still survive reentry. However, it was calculated that impact would occur in the Arabian Sea and in all likelihood, the cold ocean water would crack the heat shield and cause it to sink. No attempt was made to recover SAMOS 6, which did apparently land in the Arabian Sea. At this point, the idea of the recoverable capsule was abandoned and the electro-optical system put back into use. It proved no more successful than before and after another five SAMOS launches, the program was terminated.

By the end of 1962, when the last SAMOS satellite flew, only the CORONA program had managed to return usable reconnaissance images. The photos obtained by SAMOS 2 back at the start of 1961 were considered little more than curiosities, their resolution too low for reconnaissance. The Lanyard program had by this time emerged as a successor to SAMOS, and by 1962, CORONA was at last reaching operational status.

In addition, aside program was operated during this period (Program 102) which launched a modified SAMOS on the Thor-Agena B with no cameras at all, but instead electronic monitoring equipment for detecting Soviet missile launches — what could be described as an early ELINT satellite. Four of these were launched from 1962 to 1963 with one failure when the first satellite&#x27;s Agena-B failed to restart in orbit. The standard SAMOS apparently also carried ELINT subsatellites that remained attached to the Agena-B stage.

Like most early space programs, SAMOS had goals that exceeded what contemporary technology was capable of, and the launch vehicles used to orbit it were nearly as marginal as the satellite itself. Digital photography was not attempted successfully until the KH-11 satellites came online in the late 1970s.

== Vehicle missions ==
From October 1960 to November 1962, at least 11 launch attempts were made. Portions of the program are still considered classified information. It is believed that the program was cancelled because the imagery produced was poor. The program was operated by the United States Air Force, but was overshadowed by the CIA CORONA program.
At least two different generations of the satellite were made, and at least four different types of cameras were used. Early on, the idea was to use frame readout cameras that would take a picture and send the scanned image via radio to ground stations on Earth. This system was apparently troublesome, so the program also developed a photographic film return system where the camera and used film would be ejected and be retrieved as it floated down through the atmosphere by parachute. Film-return satellites would remain the standard until the KH-11 satellite with digital imaging capability emerged in the 1970s.

== Equipment ==

SAMOS satellites used four types of cameras. The E-1 and E-2 cameras used the readout method. Little is known about the E-3 type of camera, which was eventually cancelled. It likely had higher resolution, and may have been superseded by the later E-6. An E-4 camera was initially planned for relatively low-resolution mapmaking purposes, but it was cancelled with the functionality being taken up by the KH-5 (Argon) satellite. The E-5 and E-6 were panoramic format film cameras that appeared in later launches, but only a few were used. The E-5 would later be called upon in the short-lived KH-6 (Lanyard) program.

E-1 camera, particularly the unique system of developing and scanning the film on orbit, was later adopted by Kodak for NASA moon cartographic Lunar Orbiter program.

Some satellites were equipped with so-called Ferret devices, for &quot;ferreting&quot; information by spying on electronic communication. A more modern term for that activity would be Signals Intelligence. Toward the end of the program, satellites were only being launched with Ferrets, without any cameras. Two Ferret systems were created, designated F-1 and F-2.

Some additional payloads were sometimes on board, mostly scientific devices for learning more about the space environment so that future satellites could be better-designed for spaceflight. The satellites as launched varied in mass from 1,845 to 1,890 kilograms.

== Orbit ==
SAMOS 2 was the first satellite to enter a Sun-synchronous orbit.

== Recovery by Soviets ==
Sergei Khrushchev wrote in his memoirs about the partial recovery of what he believed was a SAMOS satellite, except the date, was the winter before the program started. A second capsule was apparently recovered in early 1961, although the device had been disassembled by local farmers, exposing film and preventing the Soviets from determining the satellite&#x27;s capabilities. It may or may not have been a SAMOS.

<doc id="632323" wikidata="Q5192552" url="?curid=632323" title="CueCat">
<text>The CueCat, styled :CueCat with a leading colon, is a cat-shaped handheld barcode reader designed to allow a user to open a link to an Internet URL by scanning a barcode. The devices were given away free to Internet users starting in 2000 by the now-defunct Digital Convergence Corporation.

By year-end 2001, barcodes were no longer distributed for the device, and scanning with the device using its original software no longer yielded results. However, third-party software can decode the lightweight encryption in the device, allowing it to be used as a general-purpose wand-type barcode reader. The CueCat can read several common barcode types, in addition to the proprietary CUE barcodes which had been promoted by Digital Convergence.

==Description==
The CueCat was named CUE for the unique bar code which the device scanned and CAT as a wordplay on &quot;Keystroke Automation Technology&quot;. It enabled a user to open a link to an Internet URL by scanning a barcode — called a &quot;cue&quot; by Digital Convergence — appearing in an article or catalog or on some other printed matter. In this way, a user could be directed to a web page containing related information without having to type in a URL. The company asserted that the ability of the device to direct users to a specific URL, rather than a domain name, was valuable. In addition, television broadcasters could use an audio tone in programs or commercials that, if a TV was connected to a computer via an audio cable, acted as a web address shortcut.

The CueCat was connected to computers in the same way as a keystroke logger, as a &quot;keyboard wedge&quot;, interposer, or pass-through between the keyboard PS/2 jack and the motherboard PS/2 port. Because of USB-PS/2 compatibility, USB-PS/2 adapters may be optionally used. A native USB version of the CueCat scanner hardware was also produced, but fewer of them were made before all manufacturing of the hardware was discontinued.

== Marketing ==

The CueCat patents are held by Jeffry Jovan Philyaw, who changed his name to Jovan Hutton Pulitzer after the failure of CueCat. Belo Corporation, parent company of the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; and owner of many TV stations, invested US$37.5 million in Digital Convergence, RadioShack $30 million, Young &amp; Rubicam $28 million, and Coca-Cola $10 million. Other investors included General Electric, and E. W. Scripps Company. The total amount invested was $185 million.

Each CueCat cost RadioShack about $6.50 to manufacture. 

Starting in late 2000 and continuing for about a year, advertisements, special web editions, and editorial content containing CueCat barcodes appeared in many US periodicals, including &quot;Parade&quot;, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;Wired&quot;. &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; and other Belo-owned newspapers printed the barcodes next to major articles and regular features like stocks and weather. Commercial publications such as &quot;Adweek&quot;, &quot;Brandweek&quot;, and &quot;Mediaweek&quot; employed the technology. The CueCat bar codes also appeared in select Verizon Yellow Pages, providing advertisers with a link to additional information. 

For a time, RadioShack printed these barcodes in its product catalogs, and distributed CueCat devices through its retail chain to customers at no charge. &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine mailed out the first 830,000 CueCats as gifts to their subscribers, since the magazine was starting to print CRQ (&quot;See Our Cue&quot;) barcodes in their magazine. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine mailed over 500,000 of the free devices as gifts to their subscribers. Each publisher private-branded the CueCat hardware they sent to their mailing list.

==User experience==
Installation of software and hardware, configuration, and registration took around an hour. Registration required the user&#x27;s name, age, and e-mail address, and demanded completion of a lengthy survey with invasive questions about shopping habits, hobbies, and educational level. Then users could scan bar codes on groceries, bar codes on books, and custom bar codes in ads in magazines, newspapers, Verizon Yellow Pages, and RadioShack catalogs. The &quot;:CRQ&quot; software then used that unique serial number from the device to return a URL which directed the user&#x27;s browser to the sponsored website. It also created a permanent advertisement-displaying taskbar on the user&#x27;s computers, and could log the web-surfing habits associated with a user&#x27;s real name and email address.

==Reception==
In &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Walter Mossberg criticized CueCat: &quot;In order to scan in codes from magazines and newspapers, you have to be reading them in front of your PC. That&#x27;s unnatural and ridiculous.&quot; Mossberg wrote that the device &quot;fails miserably. Using it is just unnatural.&quot; He concluded that the CueCat &quot;isn&#x27;t worth installing and using, even though it&#x27;s available free of charge&quot;. Joel Spolsky, a computer technology reviewer, also criticized the device as &quot;not solving a problem&quot; and characterized the venture as a &quot;feeble business idea&quot;.

The CueCat is now widely described as a commercial failure. It was ranked twentieth in &quot;The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time&quot; by &quot;PC World&quot; magazine in 2006. The CueCat&#x27;s critics said the device was ultimately of little use. Joe Salkowski of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote, &quot;You have to wonder about a business plan based on the notion that people want to interact with a soda can&quot;, while Debbie Barham of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; quipped that the CueCat &quot;fails to solve a problem which never existed&quot;. In December 2009, the popular gadget blog &quot;Gizmodo&quot; voted the CueCat the #1 worst invention of the decade of the &quot;2000s&quot;. In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included it on a list of &quot;The 50 worst Inventions&quot;, adding that people didn&#x27;t accept &quot;the idea of reading their magazines next to a wired cat-shaped scanner&quot;.

The CueCat device was controversial, initially because of privacy concerns about its collection of aggregate user data. Each CueCat has a unique serial number, and users suspected that Digital Convergence could compile a database of all barcodes scanned by a given user and connect it to the user&#x27;s name and address. For this reason, and because the demographic market targeted by Digital Convergence was unusually tech-savvy, numerous websites arose detailing instructions for &quot;declawing&quot; the CueCat — blocking or encrypting the data it sent to Digital Convergence. Digital Convergence registered the domain &quot;digitaldemographics.com&quot;, giving additional credence to privacy concerns about the use of data.

==Security breach==
According to Internet technologist and Interhack founder Matt Curtin, each scan delivered the product code, the user&#x27;s ID and the scanner&#x27;s ID back to Digital Convergence.

The data format was proprietary, and was scrambled so the barcode data could not be read as plain text. However, the barcode itself is closely related to Code 128, and the scanner was also capable of reading EAN/UPC and other symbologies, such as Priority Mail, UPC-A, UPC-E, EAN-13, EAN-8, 2-of-5 interleaved, CODABAR, CODE39, CODE128, and ISBN. Because of the weak obfuscation of the data, meant only to protect the company under DMCA guidelines (like DVD-Video&#x27;s Content Scramble System), software for decoding the CueCat&#x27;s output quickly appeared on the Internet, followed by a plethora of unofficial applications.
&quot;:CRQ&quot; (&quot;see our cue&quot;), the desktop software, intercepted the data from both the keyboard and the CueCat, before passing it on to the operating system. Versions for both Windows 32-bit or Mac OS 9 were included. Users of this software were required to register with their ZIP code, gender, and email address. This registration process enabled the device to deliver relevant content to a single or multiple users in a household.

Privacy groups warned that it could be used to track readers&#x27; online behavior because each unit has a unique identifier. Belo officials said they would not track individual CueCat users but would gather anonymous information grouped by age, gender and ZIP code.

In September 2000, security watchdog website Securitywatch.com notified Digital Convergence of a security vulnerability on the Digital Convergence website that exposed private information about CueCat users. Digital Convergence immediately shut down that part of their website, and their investigation concluded that approximately 140,000 CueCat users who had registered their CueCat were exposed to a breach that revealed their name, email address, age range, gender and zip code. This was not a breach of the main user database itself, but a flat text file used only for reporting purposes that was generated by ColdFusion code that was saved on a publicly available portion of the Digital Convergence web server.

This failure was given a multi-citation Octopus TV &quot;Failure Award&quot; regarding brands that failed to take off and were hacked.

== Aftermath ==
Digital Convergence responded to this security breach by sending an email to those affected by the incident claiming that it was correcting this problem and would be offering them a $10 gift certificate to RadioShack, an investor in Digital Convergence.

The company&#x27;s initial response to these hacks was to assert that users did not own the devices and had no right to modify or reverse engineer them. Threats of legal action against the hackers swiftly brought on more controversy and criticism. The company changed the licensing agreement several times, adding explicit restrictions, apparently in response to hacker activity. Hackers argued that the changes did not apply retroactively to devices that had been purchased under older versions of the license, and that the thousands of users who received unsolicited CueCats in the mail had neither agreed to nor were legally bound by the license.

No lawsuit was ever brought against &quot;hackers&quot;, as this tactic was not employed to go after specific users or the hacker community, but to show &quot;reasonable assertion&quot;. This would prevent another corporation from developing integrated software within an operating system or browser, which could take over the device and circumvent the :CRQ supervisory software and the revenue model that Digital Convergence desired.

In May 2001, Digital Convergence fired most of its 225-person workforce.

In September 2001, Belo Corporation, CueCat investor and owner of newspapers and TV stations, who had sent at least 200,000 free CueCats to its readers, wrote off their $37.5 million investment, and stopped using CueCat technology with newspapers&#x27;s editions, notably &quot;The Press-Enterprise&quot;, &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, and &quot;The Providence Journal&quot;.

Investors in CueCat lost their $185 million. Technology journalist Scott Rosenberg called the CueCat a &quot;Rube Goldberg contraption&quot;, a &quot;massive flop&quot;, and a &quot;fiasco&quot;.

== Awards ==
In 2001, &quot;Computerworld&quot; named CueCat as a Laureate in the Media Arts &amp; Entertainment category.

In 2001, &quot;Software and Information Industry Association&quot; named Digital Convergence Corp.&#x27;s :CRQ Technology as Best Reference Tool.
== Surplus liquidation ==
In June 2005, a liquidator offered two million CueCats for sale at $0.30 each (in quantities of 500,000 or more).

Once available for free, the device can now be found on sale at eBay for prices ranging from $5 to as much as $100.

== Open source ==
Hobbyists have reverse-engineered the firmware, software, and the customer database. Other unrelated companies sold and supported surplus new CueCats as low-cost barcode scanners for use with their software, such as the Readerware library cataloging utility. Eventually, the widespread availability of barcode scanner smartphone apps made the CueCat&#x27;s capabilities mostly superfluous.

<text>A transit of Venus takes place when Venus passes directly between the Sun and the Earth (or any other superior planet), becoming visible against (and hence obscuring a small portion of) the solar disk. During a transit, Venus is visible as a small black circle moving across the face of the Sun.

Transits of Venus reoccur periodically. A pair of transits takes place eight years apart in December (Gregorian calendar) followed by a gap of 121.5 years, before another pair occurs eight years apart in June, followed by another gap, of 105.5 years. The dates advance by about two days per 243-year cycle. The periodicity is a reflection of the fact that the orbital periods of Earth and Venus are close to 8:13 and 243:395 commensurabilities. The last pairs of transits occurred on 8 June 2004 and 5–6 June 2012. The next pair of transits will occur on 10–11 December 2117 and 8 December 2125.

Transits of Venus were in the past used to determine the size of the Solar System. The 2012 transit has provided research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.

== Conjunctions ==
The orbit of Venus has an inclination of 3.39° relative to that of the Earth, and so passes under (or over) the Sun when viewed from the Earth. A transit occurs when Venus reaches conjunction with the Sun whilst also passing through the Earth&#x27;s orbital plane, and passes directly across the face of the Sun. Sequences of transits usually repeat every 243 years, after which Venus and Earth have returned to nearly the same point in their respective orbits. During the Earth&#x27;s 243 sidereal orbital periods, which total 88,757.3 days, Venus completes 395 sidereal orbital periods of 224.701 days each, which is equal to 88,756.9 Earth days. This period of time corresponds to 152 synodic periods of Venus.

A pair of transits takes place eight years apart in December, followed by a gap of 121.5 years, before another pair occurs eight years apart in June, followed by another gap, of 105.5 years. Other patterns are possible within the 243-year cycle, because of the slight mismatch between the times when the Earth and Venus arrive at the point of conjunction. Prior to 1518, the pattern of transits was 8, 113.5, and 121.5 years, and the eight inter-transit gaps before the AD 546 transit were 121.5 years apart. The current pattern will continue until 2846, when it will be replaced by a pattern of 105.5, 129.5, and 8 years. Thus, the 243-year cycle is relatively stable, but the number of transits and their timing within the cycle vary over time. Since the 243:395 Earth:Venus commensurability is only approximate, there are different sequences of transits occurring 243 years apart, each extending for several thousand years, which are eventually replaced by other sequences. For instance, there is a series which ended in 541 BC, and the series which includes 2117 only started in AD 1631.

== History of observation of the transits==
Ancient Indian, Greek, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Chinese observers knew of Venus and recorded the planet&#x27;s motions. Pythagoras is credited with realizing that the so-called morning and evening stars were really both the planet Venus. There is no evidence that any of these cultures observed planetary transits. It has been proposed that frescoes found at the Maya site at Mayapan may contain a pictorial representation of the 12th or 13th century transits.

The Persian polymath Avicenna claimed to have observed Venus as a spot on the Sun. There was a transit on 24 May 1032, but Avicenna did not give the date of his observation, and modern scholars have questioned whether he could have observed the transit from his location; he may have mistaken a sunspot for Venus. He used his alleged transit observation to help establish that Venus was, at least sometimes, below the Sun in Ptolemaic cosmology, i.e., the sphere of Venus comes before the sphere of the Sun when moving out from the Earth in the then prevailing geocentric model.

=== 1631 and 1639 transits===
The German astronomer Johannes Kepler predicted the 1631 transit in 1627, but his methods were not sufficiently accurate to predict that it could not be seen throughout most of Europe. As a consequence, astronomers were unable to use his prediction to observe the event.

The first recorded observation of a transit of Venus was made by the English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks from his home at Carr House in Much Hoole, near Preston, on 4 December 1639 (24 November O.S.). His friend William Crabtree observed the transit from nearby Broughton. Kepler had predicted transits in 1631 and 1761 and a near miss in 1639. Horrocks corrected Kepler&#x27;s calculation for the orbit of Venus, realized that transits of Venus would occur in pairs 8 years apart, and so predicted the transit of 1639. Although he was uncertain of the exact time, he calculated that the transit was to begin at approximately 15:00. Horrocks focused the image of the Sun through a simple telescope and onto paper, where he could observe the Sun without damaging his eyesight. After waiting for most of the day, he eventually saw the transit when clouds obscuring the Sun cleared at about 15:15, half an hour before sunset. His observations allowed him to make a well-informed guess for the diameter of Venus and an estimate of the mean distance between the Earth and the Sun (). His observations were not published until 1661, well after Horrocks&#x27;s death. Horrocks based his calculation on the (false) presumption that each planet&#x27;s size was proportional to its rank from the Sun, &quot;not&quot; on the parallax effect as used by the 1761 and 1769 and following experiments.

=== 1761 transit===

In 1663, the Scottish mathematician James Gregory had suggested in his &quot;&quot; that observations of a transit of Mercury, at widely spaced points on the surface of the Earth, could be used to calculate the solar parallax, and hence the astronomical unit by means of triangulation. Aware of this, the English astronomer Edmond Halley made observations of such a transit on 28 October O.S. 1677 from the island of Saint Helena, but was disappointed to find that only Richard Towneley in the Lancashire town of Burnley, Lancashire had made another accurate observation of the event, whilst Gallet, at Avignon, had simply recorded that it had occurred. Halley was not satisfied that the resulting calculation of the solar parallax of 45&quot; was accurate.

In a paper published in 1691, and a more refined one in 1716, Halley proposed that more accurate calculations could be made using measurements of a transit of Venus, although the next such event was not due until 1761 (6 June N.S., 26 May O.S.). In an attempt to observe the first transit of the pair, astronomers from Britain (William Wales and Captain James Cook), Austria (Maximilian Hell), and France (Jean-Baptiste Chappe d&#x27;Auteroche and Guillaume Le Gentil) took part in expeditions to places that included Siberia, Newfoundland, and Madagascar. Most of them observed at least part of the transit. Jeremiah Dixon and Charles Mason succeeded in observing the transit at the Cape of Good Hope, but Nevil Maskelyne and Robert Waddington were less successful on Saint Helena, although they put their voyage to good use by trialling the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.

Venus was generally thought to possess an atmosphere prior to the transit of 1761, but the possibility that it could be detected during a transit seems not to have been considered. The discovery of the planet’s atmosphere has long been attributed to the Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov, after he observed the 1761 transit from the Imperial Academy of Sciences of St. Petersburg. The attribution to Lomonosov seems to have arisen from comments made in 1966 by the astronomy writer Willy Ley, who wrote that Lomonosov had inferred the existence of an atmosphere from his observation of a luminous arc. The attribution has since then been questioned.

===1769 transit===

For the 1769 transit, scientists travelled to places all over the world. The Czech astronomer Christian Mayer was invited by the Russian empress Catherine the Great to observe the transit in Saint Petersburg with Anders Johan Lexell, while other members of the Russian Academy of Sciences went to eight other locations in the Russian Empire under the general coordination of Stepan Rumovsky. King George III of the United Kingdom had the King&#x27;s Observatory built near his summer residence at Richmond Lodge, so that he and the Astronomer Royal, Stephen Demainbray, could observe the transit. Hell and his assistant János Sajnovics travelled to Vardø, Norway. Wales and Joseph Dymond went to Hudson Bay to observe the event. In Philadelphia, the American Philosophical Society erected three temporary observatories and appointed a committee led by David Rittenhouse. Observations were made by a group led by Dr. Benjamin West in Providence, Rhode Island, Observations were also made from Tahiti by Captain James Cook and Charles Green at a location still known as Point Venus. 

D&#x27;Auteroche went to San José del Cabo in what was then New Spain to observe the transit with two Spanish astronomers (Vicente de Doz and Salvador de Medina). For his trouble he died in an epidemic of yellow fever there shortly after completing his observations. Only 9 of 28 in the entire party returned home alive. Le Gentil spent over eight years travelling in an attempt to observe either of the transits. Whilst abroad he was declared dead, and as a result he lost his wife and possessions. Upon his return he regained his seat in the French Academy and remarried. Under the influence of the Royal Society, the astronomer Ruđer Bošković travelled to Istanbul, but arrived after the transit had happened.

In 1771, using the combined 1761 and 1769 transit data, the French astronomer Jérôme Lalande calculated the astronomical unit to have a value of . The precision was less than had been hoped for because of the black drop effect. The value obtained was still an improvement on the calculations made by Horrocks. Hell published his results in 1770, which included a value for the astronomical unit of . Lalande challenged the accuracy and authenticity of observations obtained by the Hell expedition, but later wrote an article in &quot;Journal des sçavans&quot; (1778), in which he retracted his comments.

=== 1874 and 1882 transits===
Observations of the transits of 1874 and 1882 worked to refine the value obtained for the astronomical unit. Three expeditions—from Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States—were sent to the Kerguelen Archipelago for the 1874 observations. The American astronomer Simon Newcomb combined the data from the last four transits, and he arrived at a value of .

=== 2004 and 2012 transits===

Scientific organisations led by the European Southern Observatory organised a network of amateur astronomers and students to measure Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun during the transit of 2004. The participants&#x27; observations allowed a calculation of the astronomical unit (AU) of , which differed from the accepted value by 0.007%.

During the 2004 transit, scientists attempted to measure the loss of light as Venus blocked out some of the Sun&#x27;s light, in order to refine techniques for discovering extrasolar planets.

The 2012 transit of Venus provided scientists with research opportunities as well, in particular in regard to the study of exoplanets. The event additionally was the first of its kind to be documented from space, photographed aboard the International Space Station by NASA astronaut Don Pettit. The measurement of the dips in a star&#x27;s brightness during a transit is one observation that can help astronomers find exoplanets. Unlike the 2004 Venus transit, the 2012 transit occurred during an active phase of the 11-year activity cycle of the Sun, and it gave astronomers an opportunity to practise picking up a planet&#x27;s signal around a &quot;spotty&quot; variable star. Measurements made of the apparent diameter of a planet such as Venus during a transit allows scientists to estimate exoplanet sizes. Observation made of the atmosphere of Venus from Earth-based telescopes and the Venus Express gave scientists a better opportunity to understand the intermediate level of Venus&#x27;s atmosphere than was possible from either viewpoint alone, and provided new information about the climate of the planet. Spectrographic data of the atmosphere of Venus can be compared to studies of the atmospheres of exoplanets. The Hubble Space Telescope used the Moon as a mirror to study light from the atmosphere of Venus, and so determine its composition.

== Future transits ==
Transits usually occur in pairs, because the length of eight Earth years is almost the same as 13 years on Venus. This approximate conjunction is not precise enough to produce a triplet, as Venus arrives 22 hours earlier each time. The last transit not to be part of a pair was in 1396 (the planet passed slightly above the disc of the Sun in 1388); the next one will be in 3089.

After 243 years the transits of Venus return. The 1874 transit is a member of the 243-year cycle #1. The 1882 transit is a member of #2. The 2004 transit is a member of #3, and the 2012 transit is a member of #4. The 2117 transit is a member of #1, and so on. However, the ascending node (December transits) of the orbit of Venus moves backwards after each 243 years so the transit of 2854 is the last member of series #3 instead of series #1. The descending node (June transits) moves forwards, so the transit of 3705 is the last member of #2.

Over longer periods of time, new series of transits will start and old series will end. Unlike the saros series for lunar eclipses, it is possible for a transit series to restart after a hiatus. The transit series also vary much more in length than the saros series.

== Grazing and simultaneous transits ==
Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun during a transit. In this case it is possible that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen in some parts of the world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects are due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different points of view with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when the viewer opens the other eye and closes the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.

The simultaneous occurrence of transits of Mercury and Venus does occur, but extremely infrequently. Such an event last occurred on 22 September 373,173 BC and will next occur on 26 July 69,163, and again on 29 March 224,504. The simultaneous occurrence of a solar eclipse and a transit of Venus is currently possible, but very rare. The next solar eclipse occurring during a transit of Venus will be on 5 April 15,232.

== In popular culture ==
The Canadian rock band Three Days Grace titled their fourth studio album &quot;Transit of Venus&quot; and announced the album title and release date on June 5, 2012, the date of the last transit of Venus. The album&#x27;s first song, &quot;Sign of the Times&quot;, references the transit in the lyric &quot;Venus is passing by&quot;.

The progressive rock band Big Big Train have a song titled &quot;The Transit of Venus Across the Sun&quot;. It is the fifth track on their ninth album Folklore (Big Big Train album).

The Transit of Venus March was written by John Philip Sousa in 1883 to commemorate the 1882 transit.

<text>Toxicoscordion fremontii, known as the common star lily or Frémont&#x27;s deathcamas (after John C. Frémont) or star zigadene, is an attractive wildflower found on grassy or woody slopes, or rocky outcrops, in many lower-lying regions of California, southwestern Oregon, and northern Baja California.

Like other deathcamases, &quot;T. fremontii&quot; grows from a more or less spherical bulb, which in this species has a diameter of 20–35 mm. Its leaves can reach up to half a meter in length, but are typically half that length. They grow from the base of the plant. Flowers, which can be seen from March to June, grow in clusters. They have six petals (strictly, three petals and three very similar sepals), arranged symmetrically, giving rise to the name star-lily. Each flower is 1–4 cm across.

<text>Thing T. Thing, often referred to as just Thing, is a fictional character in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; series. The Addamses called it &quot;Thing&quot; because it was something that could not be identified, being originally an unseen creature in the original cartoons, but starting with the live-action television series it was settled to be a disembodied hand. It is known as &quot;Mãozinha&quot; (Little Hand) in Brazil, &quot;Cosa&quot; (Thing) in Spain, &quot;Dedos&quot; (Fingers) in Hispanic America, &quot;Mano&quot; (Hand) in Italy, &quot;La Chose&quot; (the Thing) in French-speaking countries, &quot;eiskaltes Händchen&quot; (icecold little hand) in German, &quot;Rączka&quot; (Small hand) in Polish, and &quot;Izé&quot; (Whatchamacallit, Thingamajig) in Hungarian.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;The Addams Family&quot; media===

(The) Thing was the creation of Charles Addams, who drew the Addams Family cartoons in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, beginning in the 1930s. The Thing first appeared in Addams&#x27;s 1954 book &quot;Homebodies&quot;. According to Phil Hore, Addams was inspired by Phil Harris&#x27;s 1950 novelty song &quot;The Thing&quot;. One of Addams&#x27; cartoons introduced a mysterious entity known only as The Thing, who was said to be too horrifying to be seen by human eyes. Compared to the adaptations, The Thing is actually a person of unknown origin, observing the household through slightly-opened doors and the balustrades, from around corners, and even beneath window sills with his face and hands clearly seen by the reader.

The 1964 television series greatly expanded Thing&#x27;s role compared to the cartoons. Thing was retconned as a disembodied forearm, since he occasionally emerged from his box at near-elbow length, and was usually played by Ted Cassidy, who also played the lugubrious butler Lurch. The two characters occasionally appeared in the same scene (in which case Thing would be played by a crew member, notably assistant director Jack Voglin). Thing customarily emerged from a series of boxes, one in each room in the Addams&#x27; mansion, and the mailbox outside. He occasionally emerged from behind a curtain, within a plant pot, the family wall safe, or elsewhere.

Since Cassidy was tall, using him to depict Thing caused great technical difficulties on the set of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. In many scenes he lay on his back on a wheeled trolley, below the line of sight of the cameras, and inserted his arm through the bottom of the box. Thing was usually a right hand, but Cassidy sometimes played him as left, simply to see if anyone would notice. Thing is credited as &quot;Itself&quot; at the end of each episode.

In the later films, thanks to advances in special effects, Thing (played by Christopher Hart&#x27;s hand) is able to emerge and run on his fingertips, much like a spider. In &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;, Thing is shown driving a car into Debbie to rescue Uncle Fester. After this, Fester gets into the car and Thing drives them off to the Addams Family Mansion, albeit erratically, frightening Fester in the process. This is also true for the 1998 series &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; where Thing was played by the hand of Canadian magician/actor Steven Fox. His classic box only appears in one episode of the series (the remake of &quot;Thing&#x27;s Romance&quot;); in others, he lives in a closet that has been modified as his own &quot;house-within-a-house&quot;.

In the musical, Thing only appears in the beginning, when he opens the curtain. He is played by a member of the ensemble. In the tour version, Pugsley carries Thing on a pillow at Wednesday and Lucas&#x27;s wedding while Thing holds the ring.

Thing appears in the 2019 animated film. He appears as a disembodied hand and wears a watch with an eye on it (perhaps used to see) in some scenes, he is also shown to have a foot fetish. Thing also appears in the 2021 animated film sequel, again with a &quot;watch&quot; with an eye, which is used at various times to express Thing&#x27;s feelings, such as exasperation with an eye roll.

Thing appears in the 2022 live-action Netflix original series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, portrayed by Victor Dorobantu. Makeup was used to enhance Thing&#x27;s appearance with stitches and marks. During filming, Dorobantu would be hidden while wearing a blue suit. Thing&#x27;s language was made up on the day of filming. A stand-in hand was used instead of Dorobantu for certain times. After each take, CGI was added to Thing and editors removed Dorobantu&#x27;s body and created a skin to cover the top of Thing&#x27;s wrist. Gomez puts him in charge of watching over Wednesday while she attends Nevermore Academy, only for Wednesday to force him to help her with solving the mysteries of the school and the town of Jericho.

===In other media===

In the PlayStation game Medievil (1998), the first few levels featured Thing-looking, disembodied hands going about the same way Thing does.

In December 2021, Thing appeared in advertisements for British furniture retailer DFS, as part of their &quot;find your thing&quot; campaign.

In 2024, an advertisement aired on the Italian television featured Thing, with a voice-over referencing directly the Addams family.

==Role in the series==

Thing&#x27;s many useful roles included fetching the mail, handing cigars to Gomez Addams and then lighting them, changing the channel on the Addams TV set, holding Morticia Addams&#x27;s wool while she knits, turning grapes into wine in under a minute, and turning over records on the phonograph (particularly when Gomez and Morticia dance the tango). It accompanies the family on drives by riding in the glove compartment, and in one episode, where Gomez appears in court, it emerged from Gomez&#x27;s briefcase. Thing and Grandmama are fond of arm-wrestling. In a flashback episode on how Gomez and Morticia met, it is revealed that Thing has been with the Addams family since Gomez himself was a child, suggesting Thing is the son of an earlier generation of hand-servants (see below). Thing, overall, acts as the straight man of the show.

Morticia is always very appreciative of Thing&#x27;s services, and her frequent &quot;&quot;Thank&quot; you, Thing&quot; is one of the best known lines of the series; Wednesday takes after her mother in also expressing gratitude for Thing&#x27;s assistance. Thing cannot talk, but it does sometimes snap its fingers to attract attention, and is also able to communicate by signaling in Morse code, writing, or with the help of the manual alphabet. This can be very disconcerting to visitors to the Addams&#x27; mansion; in a running gag in some episodes, a visitor to the Addams home, profusely grateful for some kindness of the Addamses&#x27;, enthusiastically shakes hands with everyone present—&quot;Thank you, Mr. Addams! Thank you, Mrs. Addams!&quot;—and is then offered a handshake by Thing. &quot;And thank &quot;you&quot;...&quot; begins the visitor, before realizing who and what he has been confronted with, recoiling in inarticulate shock, and fleeing the premises.

In one episode, Morticia gets goosed, and initially suspects Thing, who had been nearby moments earlier. However, Gomez immediately appears and admits responsibility, explaining: &quot;Thing just likes to hold hands&quot;.

==Other hands==
On the 1960s TV series, two similar hands were introduced in the episode &quot;Morticia Meets Royalty&quot;:

* Lady Fingers: A female &quot;handmaiden&quot; who was the servant of Aunt Millie, also known as Princess Millicent von Schlepp. When Millicent came to visit, Thing and Lady Fingers fell in love. Lady Fingers later returned in &quot;Halloween with the New Addams Family&quot;, as the handmaiden of Granny Frump and the 1998 series revival, as the handmaiden of Cousin Pretensia. Her name is a play on &quot;Ladyfinger (biscuit)&quot;.
* Esmerelda: Another female hand hired by Millicent after firing Lady Fingers. Esmerelda turned out to be a thief and Millicent rehires Lady Fingers.

In the episode &quot;Thing Is Missing&quot;, Gomez and Morticia find a portrait of Thing&#x27;s parents, a male hand and a female hand. The 1990s revived series implied the existence of other hands as well.

<text>The Cahora Bassa lake—in the Portuguese colonial era (until 1974) known as Cabora Bassa, from Nyungwe &quot;Kahoura-Bassa&quot;, meaning &quot;finish the job&quot;—is Africa&#x27;s fourth-largest artificial lake, situated in the Tete Province in Mozambique. In Africa, only Lake Volta in Ghana, Lake Kariba on the Zambezi upstream of Cahora Bassa, and Egypt&#x27;s Lake Nasser are bigger in terms of surface water.

==History==

===Portuguese period===
The Cahora Bassa System started in the late 1960s as a project of the Portuguese in the Overseas Province of Mozambique. Southern African governments were also involved in an agreement stating that Portugal would build and operate a hydroelectric generating station at Cabora Bassa (as it was then called in Portuguese) together with the high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system required to bring electricity to the border of South Africa. South Africa, on the other hand, undertook to build and operate the Apollo converter station and part of the transmission system required to bring the electricity from the South African-Mozambican border to the Apollo converter station near Pretoria. South Africa was then obliged to buy electricity that Portugal was obliged to supply.

During the struggle for independence, construction materials for the dam were repeatedly attacked in a strategic move by Frelimo guerrillas, as its completion would cause the lake to widen so much it would take very long to cross to the other side with their canoes. The dam began to fill in December 1974, after the Carnation Revolution in mainland Portugal and the independence agreement being signed. Mozambique officially became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975.

Until November 2007, the dam was operated by &quot;Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa&quot; (HCB) and jointly owned by Mozambique, with an 18% equity stake, and Portugal, which held the remaining 82% equity. On 27 November 2007, Mozambique assumed control of the dam from Portugal, when Portugal sold to Mozambique most of its 82 percent stake. Finance Minister Fernando Teixeira dos Santos said Portugal would collect US$950 million (€750 million) from the sale of its part of southern Africa&#x27;s largest hydropower project. Portugal kept a 15 percent stake, though it planned to sell off another 10 percent at a later stage to an investor that would be proposed by the Mozambican government. Portugal&#x27;s Prime Minister, José Sócrates, signed the agreement with the Mozambican government, during an official visit to Maputo. The agreement ended decades of dispute between Portugal and its former colony over the company, called &quot;Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa&quot;. The central disagreement was over the handling of the company&#x27;s estimated US$2.2 billion (€1.7 billion) debts to Portugal. Mozambican authorities argued they had not guaranteed the debt and therefore should not be liable for the payments.

===Independent Mozambique===

Mozambique became independent from Portugal on 25 June 1975. Since closure, the Zambezi, which is the fourth largest floodplain river in Africa, has received a far more regulated flow rate, but disastrous natural floods still occur. The 1978 flood caused 45 deaths, 100,000 people to be displaced and $62 million worth of damage.

According to engineering consultants, &quot;This was the first flood since completion of Cahora Bassa, and destroyed the widely held belief that the dam would finally bring flooding under full control&quot;. For further details of ecological problems caused by the dam, see the article on the Zambezi River.

During the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992) the transmission lines were sabotaged to the extent that 1,895 towers needed to be replaced and 2,311 refurbished over a distance of 893 km on the Mozambican side of the line.

In the 1990s, after the end of the civil war, &quot;Hidroeléctrica de Cahora Bassa&quot; (HCB) appointed South Africa&#x27;s Trans-Africa Projects (TAP) to perform the construction management, quality assurance and design support service for the rehabilitation of the project. TAP assisted HCB in awarding the construction contract to a joint venture company comprising Consorzio Italia 2000 and Enel, and a scheduled period of 24 months was set for the project. The lines in South Africa were damaged to a minor extent and only normal maintenance was required by Eskom to get these lines back in operation.

Work on the project started in August 1995. The line route in Mozambique passes through dense bush and difficult terrain from Songo to the South African border near Pafuri, with both servitudes infested with landmines from the Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992) that needed to be cleared before construction work could commence. Heavy, unseasonable rainfalls later affected the programme to such an extent that the first line could only be completed in August 1997 and the second in November that same year. During the refurbishment period, TAP developed and implemented various designs and construction methods to improve the overall programme schedules and project costs. In spite of the extreme conditions within which they had to refurbish and reconstruct these lines, the work was completed within schedule and with a limited budget. The lines have, since completion, been subject to numerous tests and energised to its full potential. About 1,100 people were employed during the peak periods of construction.

The rainfalls and severe flooding during February 2000 in the Limpopo River valley again caused considerable damage to both lines to the extent that about 10 towers collapsed and need to be reconstructed within the shortest possible timeframe to restore the power supply to South Africa. TAP was again entrusted by HCB with the engineering, procurement and construction management services. TAP managed to temporarily restore power supply through the one line while a more permanent solution could be carried out on the other line. The reconstructed line is used to carry the full line capacity. TAP had to implement unconventional construction techniques to recover temporary supply. The suspension towers next to the river crossing posed a significant challenge for a temporary power solution to obtain the required clearances of the 711 metre level terrain span.

On April 27, 2009 four foreign nationals were arrested for putting a &quot;highly corrosive&quot; substance into the lake in an alleged attempt to sabotage the power station. The arrested claimed to be a team from Orgonise Africa, placing orgonite pieces in the lake to improve the quality of etheric energy (life force) of the dam.

Since 2005, the area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.

==Related economic activities==
Most of the electricity generated by Cahora Bassa, which is located on the Zambezi River in western Mozambique, is sold to nearby South Africa. In 2006, Cahora Bassa transmitted about 1,920 megawatts of power, but the infrastructure is capable of higher production levels and the company had plans to almost double its output by 2008. In 1994 the total installed capacity in Mozambique was 2,400 MW of which 91% was hydroelectric.

A considerable kapenta fishery has developed in the reservoir. The kapenta is assumed to originate from Lake Kariba where it was introduced from Lake Tanganyika. Annual catch of kapenta in the Cahora Bassa dam in 2003 exceeded 10,000 tonnes.

=== Sharks ===
It is widely believed that there is a breeding colony of Zambezi sharks &quot;trapped&quot; inside the reservoir. As the bull shark is known to travel more than 100 km upstream, this phenomenon does not conflict with existing scientific and biological fact. Usually an ocean-dwelling species, bull sharks are perfectly capable of living in fresh water for their entire lifespan. Local tribes have indeed reported sightings (and attacks) by this isolated community of shark, although these have yet to be substantiated with hard evidence.

<doc id="632357" wikidata="Q1025799" url="?curid=632357" title="Kariba, Zimbabwe">
<text>Kariba is a resort town in Mashonaland West province, Zimbabwe, located close to the Kariba Dam at the north-eastern end of Lake Kariba, near the Zambian border. According to the 2022 Population Census, the town had a population of 27,600.

Located in the Zambezi Valley, Kariba is well known for its balmy climate and proximity to Lake Kariba, that draws in thousands of tourists all year round.

==History==
The pre-colonial population of the area were Tonga.

The town was established to house workers who were constructing the dam in the mid to late 1950s and was constructed by the contractor Costain. After the completion of the dam wall and the power station (Kariba South Power Station) quite a few impressive monuments were built in the early 1960s i.e. the Roman Catholic church located at the Kariba Heights (St. Barbara) and next to it the Pat McClean Theatre named after Patricia McClean a well known wealthy resident of Kariba Heights.

==Geography==
Kariba is located on Lake Kariba, a reservoir created by Kariba Dam on the Zambezi River. Kariba has three main suburbs: Mahombekombe, the older poorer lakeshore high density suburb, Nyamhunga the newer high density suburb and Kariba Heights, the wealthier hilltop suburb and location of the Operation Noah monument. As the name suggests the heights overlook the surrounding region and offer impressive views of Lake Kariba and the opposite lakeshore to the south.

The town has road links connecting it to Harare and to the border of Zambia. It is serviced by Kariba Airport, and has ferry service to Victoria Falls via Mlibizi Fishing camp.

==Economy==
Kariba town is the centre of the tourist industry for the Lake Kariba region. Kariba town provides accommodation in various hotels and lodges. There are two casinos in the town. Many of the attractions in Kariba for the tourist are water-based. Fishing, game-viewing and house-boating are the most popular activities. Tourists also visit the Kariba Dam wall and local crocodile farms.

The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority ZESA employs workers in the hydroelectric power station. Kapenta fishing is also an important industry, though it was affected by the nation-wide fuel shortages, and in the 2010s by drought.

ZB Bank Limited, a commercial bank, maintains a branch in Kariba.

===Challenges===
In the twenty-first century, the town of Kariba faced many of the nation-wide problems brought on by the depressed national economy, including lack of foreign currency. The town had difficulty in revenue collection. As a result, its fleet did not receive proper maintenance nor replacements, which was also true of its water and sewage system, which suffered chronic pump breakdowns. Kariba also continued to have a large number of unoccupied housing units, left over from the construction boom, units which generated no income.

The restructuring of industry in the early nineties, followed by Zimbabwe economic crisis in the 2000s, greatly impacted Kariba&#x27;s tourist potential. Many former visitors and residents were involved in trade and agriculture and the impact of the country&#x27;s crisis led to a decline in domestic tourism as much of the middle class, who were the mainstay of Kariba&#x27;s tourism industry began to emigrate. In addition a lack of investment in the city&#x27;s airport and infrastructure has seen the city fall behind to nearby destinations such as Livingstone and Victoria Falls, which offer easy access to Johannesburg, Dubai and London. Once ubiquitous, South African tourists increasingly prefer cheaper and more accessible destinations like Mauritius, Tofo Beach and Pemba. As a result, its population has stagnated to fewer than 30,000 inhabitants today.

Another challenge to the town, is the increasingly outdated infrastructure, particularly Kariba Dam. Years of under-investment threaten the longevity of the dam and its ability to generate power, posing a challenge to the economies of Zambia and Zimbabwe.

== Climate ==

Kariba has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw), with warm winters and very hot summers, and a marked drier season in the winter. Although it is relatively cooler than typical tropical places in the winter and does get occasional lows, Kariba nevertheless meets the minimum requirements to be in the savanna climate zone, making it one of few locations in Zimbabwe within this classification. The city&#x27;s low elevation by Zimbabwean standards, lakeside location, northern locality, and proximity to the Intertropical Convergence Zone shape its climate. Average winter high temperatures, from May to August, range from . July is the coolest month with an average daily temperature of . Low temperatures fall below about 10–15 nights during the winter season, after the passage of cold fronts from the south east that may sometimes produce winter precipitation.

<text>Lake Kariba is the world&#x27;s largest artificial lake and reservoir by volume. It lies upstream from the mouth of the Zambezi river on the Indian Ocean, along the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe. Lake Kariba was filled between 1958 and 1963 following the completion of the Kariba Dam at its northeastern end, flooding the Kariba Gorge on the Zambezi River.
The Zimbabwean town of Kariba was built for construction workers on the lake&#x27;s dam, while some other settlements such as Binga village and Mlibizi in Zimbabwe and Siavonga and Sinazongwe in Zambia have expanded to house people displaced by the damming of the river.

==Physical characteristics==
Lake Kariba is over long and up to in width. It covers an area of and its storage capacity is . The mean depth of the lake is ; the maximum depth is . It is the world&#x27;s largest man-made reservoir by volume, four times as large as the Three Gorges Dam. The enormous mass of water is believed to have caused induced seismicity in the seismically active region, including over 20 earthquakes of greater than 5 magnitude on the Richter scale.

The lake has several islands, including Maaze Island, Mashape Island, Chete Island, Sekula, Sampa Karuma, Fothergill, Spurwing, Snake Island, Antelope Island, Bed Island, and Chikanka.

==Ecology==

During the filling-up phase of the lake, the water was high in nutrients coming from decomposing, inundated vegetation, creating a thick layer of fertile soil on land that became the lake bed. As a result, the ecology of Lake Kariba is vibrant. A number of fish species have been introduced to the lake, notably the sardine-like kapenta (transported from Lake Tanganyika), which now supports a thriving commercial fishery. Other inhabitants of Lake Kariba include Nile crocodiles and hippopotamuses.

Gamefish, particularly tigerfish, which was among the indigenous species of the Zambezi river system, now thrive on the kapenta, which in turn encourages tourism. Both Zambia and Zimbabwe are now attempting to develop the tourism industry along their respective coasts of Lake Kariba.

Fish eagles, cormorants and other water birds patrol the shorelines, as do large numbers of elephants and other big game species including lion, cheetah, leopard, buffalo and a myriad of smaller plains game species. The southern Matusadona National Park was once a haven for black and white rhinoceros, but recent poaching activity has dramatically reduced their numbers.

==Protected areas==
The portion of Lake Kariba which falls within Zimbabwe has been designated a recreational park within the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Estate.

<doc id="632362" wikidata="Q929389" url="?curid=632362" title="Haftara">
<text>The haftara or (in Ashkenazic pronunciation) haftorah (alt. haftarah, haphtara, ) &quot;parting,&quot; &quot;taking leave&quot; (plural form: &quot;haftarot&quot; or &quot;haftoros&quot;), is a series of selections from the books of &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; (&quot;Prophets&quot;) of the Hebrew Bible (&quot;Tanakh&quot;) that is publicly read in synagogue as part of Jewish religious practice. The &quot;haftara&quot; reading follows the Torah reading on each Sabbath and on Jewish festivals and fast days. Typically, the &quot;haftara&quot; is thematically linked to the &quot;parashah&quot; (weekly Torah portion) that precedes it. The &quot;haftara&quot; is sung in a chant. (Chanting of Biblical texts is known as &quot;ta&#x27;amim&quot; in Hebrew, &quot;trope&quot; in Yiddish, or &quot;cantillation&quot; in English.) Related blessings precede and follow the haftara reading.

The origin of haftara reading is lost to history, and several theories have been proposed to explain its role in Jewish practice, suggesting it arose in response to the persecution of the Jews under Antiochus IV Epiphanes which preceded the Maccabean Revolt, wherein Torah reading was prohibited, or that it was &quot;instituted against the Samaritans, who denied the canonicity of the Prophets (except for Joshua), and later against the Sadducees.&quot; Another theory is that it was instituted after some act of persecution or other disaster in which the synagogue Torah scrolls were destroyed or ruined, as it was forbidden to read the Torah portion from any but a ritually fit parchment scroll, but there was no such requirement about a reading from Prophets, which was then &quot;substituted as a temporary expedient and then remained.&quot; The Talmud mentions that a &quot;haftara&quot; was read in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hurcanus, who lived c. 70 CE, and that by the time of Rabbah bar Nahmani (the 3rd century) there was a &quot;Scroll of Haftarot&quot;, which is not further described. Several references in the Christian New Testament suggest this Jewish custom was in place during that era.

==History==
No one knows for certain the origins of reading the haftara, but several theories have been put forth. The most common explanation, accepted by some traditional Jewish authorities is that in 168 BCE, when the Jews were under the rule of the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes, they were forbidden to read the Torah and made do with a substitute. When they were again able to read the Torah, they kept reading the &quot;haftara&quot; as well. However, this theory was not articulated before the 14th century, when it was suggested by Rabbi David Abudirham, and has several weaknesses.

An alternative explanation, offered by Rabbis Reuven Margolies and Samson Raphael Hirsch (except where otherwise identified, this is the Hirsch cited throughout this article), is that the haftara reading was instituted to fight the influence of those sects in Judaism that viewed the Hebrew Bible as consisting only of the Torah.

However, all offered explanations for the origin of reading the haftara have unanswered difficulties.

Certainly the haftara was read — perhaps not obligatorily nor in all communities nor on every Sabbath — as far back as circa 70 CE: The Talmud mentions that a &quot;haftara&quot; was read in the presence of Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, who lived at that time. The Christian Bible indicates that readings from the Prophets - but not necessarily a fixed schedule - was a common part of the Sabbath service in Jerusalem synagogues even earlier than 70 CE.

==Who reads the &quot;haftara&quot;==
Only one person reads the haftara portion. This differs from the procedure in Torah reading, wherein the text is divided into anywhere from three to seven portions, which may be read by one person or divided amongst several.

The haftara is traditionally read by the &quot;maftir&quot;, or the last person to be called up to the Torah scroll.

Traditions varied or evolved with regard to which person could read the haftara. As an indication that, perhaps to make clear that the haftara reading was not the same status as the Torah reading, a minor (i.e., a boy not yet bar mitzvah age) was permitted to chant the haftara (at least on an ordinary Sabbath), and there were even communities where the haftara reading was reserved exclusively for minor boys. In recent centuries, Ashkenazi bar mitzvah boys, (now an adult) will read at least the &quot;maftir&quot; portion and the haftara. In some other communities, the haftara could only be read by one who had participated in the Torah reading (in some practices, the &quot;maftir&quot; - the last man to have read from the Torah), or even the whole congregation would read the haftara to themselves from the available &quot;humashim&quot; - this evidently to avoid embarrassing a reader who might make a mistake.

Rabbi Yosef Karo (16th century) reported that for many years there were no set haftarot: the &quot;maftir&quot; chose an appropriate passage from the &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;. Over time, certain choices became established in certain communities; in contemporary Jewish observance one may not choose his own haftara, explained Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, as that would run against accepted custom. Rabbi Karo&#x27;s explanation, however, helps to explain why communities have varying customs regarding what to read as haftara.

==What form of the text is read==
Unlike the Torah portion, the haftara is, nowadays, normally read from a printed book. This may be either a Tanakh (entire Hebrew Bible), a Chumash (or &quot;Humash&quot;; plural: Chumashim)) (volume containing the Torah with haftarot) or, in the case of the festivals, the prayer book; there are also books containing the haftarot alone in large print. Even when a scroll of haftara readings is used, that scroll - unlike the Torah scroll - is occasionally made of paper and may include such embellishments as the vowel points and &quot;trope.&quot;

However, according to most halakhic decisors (&quot;posqim&quot;), it is preferable to read the haftara out of a parchment scroll, and according to a small minority of posqim (mainly the followers of the Vilna Gaon), such a parchment scroll is an absolute requirement. This may take various forms.
* According to some older traditions, the haftarot were read out of a special scroll containing just the selections of the Prophetic Books which were used in actual haftarot; this was known as a &quot;Sifra De&#x27;aftarta&quot; (ספרא דאפטרתא), and can still be found in a few communities today, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic; in some communities the scroll is made of paper. These scrolls sometimes contain vowel points and te`amim (cantillation signs), and sometimes do not.
*However, the Vilna Gaon instituted that haftarot be read only from scrolls which contained the full text of a Prophetic Book (e.g., full text of Joshua, or full text of Judges, or full text of Isaiah), just as a Torah scroll contains the full text of the Pentateuch. These scrolls are written in accordance with the laws of writing Torah scrolls, and thus - in the opinion of the Vilna Gaon - do not contain vowel points or cantillation signs. Such scrolls are used for the reading of the haftarot in many, perhaps most, Lithuanian-style yeshivot, and in a number of Ashkenazic synagogues, especially in Israel. Some say that if such a scroll is unavailable the entire congregation must read the haftara for themselves, silently or in a murmur, from books rather than the &quot;maftir&quot; reciting aloud from something other than a scroll.

It would seem that the initial resistance to using a printed book has diminished as the technology of printing, and therefore the accuracy and characteristics of the printed books, has improved. There were opinions that a haftara scroll should not be stored in the holy ark, but other opinions (such as Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef) were that it was permitted; however the haftara scroll is not decorated in the manner of the Torah scrolls but may be given distinctive (and inferior, such as copper) decorations.

==Blessings==
Blessings both precede and follow the haftara reading. One reason the reading of the haftara is a special honor is because of the voluminous blessings that accompany the reading. These blessings are derived from the minor (and uncanonical) Talmudic tractate &quot;Massekhet Soferim&quot; - also called, simply, &quot;Soferim&quot;, which dates back to the 7th or 8th century CE. But it is possible that these blessings, or at least some of them, date from before the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. At least some haftara blessings were in use by the second century. The blessings are read by the person designated to read the haftara portion; the blessing before the haftara is read in the tune of the haftara. The Sephardic practice is to recite, immediately after the text of the haftara and before the concluding blessings, the verse of Isaiah 47:4 (&quot;Our Redeemer! The Lord of Hosts is his name, the Holy Lord of Israel!&quot;). The blessings following the haftara are standard on all occasions the haftara is read, except for the final blessing, which varies by date and is omitted on some days.

There are five blessings, one before, and the others after, the haftara reading. These blessings may go back as far as the haftara ritual itself. It will be immediately noticed that the haftara has more, and longer, blessings than the reading of the Torah itself; it is plausible that the reading from the Prophets was given this distinction in order to emphasize the sacred nature of the Prophetic books in the face of Samaritan rejection. If the haftara is read by the &quot;maftir&quot;, then he had already recited two blessings for the Torah reading and the five haftara blessings means he has recited a total of the significant number of seven blessings. The first blessing is not recited until the Torah scroll has been rolled shut, so that the roller may listen without distraction. And, similarly, the haftara text itself - whether a book or a scroll - remains open on the lectern until after the final haftara blessing is concluded. The blessings have changed but only a little over the centuries, the current text apparently coming from the late 11th century &quot;Machzor Vitry&quot;, with slight differences from the texts perpetuated in the tractate Massekhet Soferim (possibly 7th or 8th century), and the writings of Maimonides, dating back to the 12th century.

The first blessing, chanted before the haftara portion read, uses the same melody as the haftara chant itself, also in minor mode. For this reason, many prayerbooks print this first blessing with the cantillation marks used in the Bible itself for the books of the Prophets, possibly the only instance of a non-biblical text to be equipped with such marks. This initial blessing is only two verses, but both begin with blessing God, yet are not interrupted by an intervening Amen.

The blessings are as follows: The first blessing precedes the reading:
&lt;poem&gt;Blessed are you, &quot;Lord&quot;   [YHVH], our God, King of the universe,
Who has chosen good prophets,
And was pleased with their words spoken in truth.

Blessed are you, &quot;Lord&quot;, who has chosen the Torah, and his servant Moses,
And his people Israel,
And the prophets of truth and righteousness.
:::[&quot;congregation&quot;: Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;

This is a somewhat free translation from the poetic Hebrew text which is roughly the same in both Ashkenazic and Sephardic prayerbooks. The blessing is printed in one paragraph and read continuously by the cantillist with only an etnachta between sentences. The first blessing is straight from the minor tractate Massekhet Soferim, chapter 13, paragraph 7. The first verse praises God, &quot;who has chosen good prophets&quot; (presumably distinguished from false prophets not called by God), the second verse is one of the few places in the Sabbath liturgy that mentions Moses, also chosen by God as were the prophets. &quot;Pleased with &quot;their&quot; words&quot; because, while Moses wrote the Torah of words dictated verbatim by God, the prophets were each speaking their own words, which won Divine approval after they were spoken. In this context, &#x27;Israel&#x27; means world Jewry wherever they may be.

Immediately after the last word of the haftara has been read, many Sefardic, Mizrahi, and Italic congregations traditionally recite two Bible verses, which are then repeated by the maftir:
&lt;poem&gt;Our Redeemer - &quot;the Lord&quot; of Hosts is his name - the holy one of Israel.
Blessed be &quot;the Lord&quot; forever. Amen and Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;

The blessings that follow the reading of the haftara are chanted in the pentatonic scale.

The second blessing follows the end of the Prophetic reading:
&lt;poem&gt;Blessed are you, &quot;Lord&quot;, our God, King of the universe,
Rock of all the worlds, righteous through all eras,
The trustworthy God, who says and does, who speaks and fulfills,
For all his words are true and just.

Trustworthy are you, &quot;Lord&quot;, and trustworthy are your words,
And not a single one of your words is recalled as unfulfilled,
Because you are God, king, trustworthy.
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;, the God who is trustworthy in all his words.
:::[&quot;congregation&quot;: Amen.]&lt;/poem&gt;

Again, this is straight from Massekhet Soferim, paragraphs 8 and 10; Paragraph 9 set out a congregational response which seems not to have been adopted; after the first verse the congregation would rise and say &quot;Faithful are you &quot;Lord&quot; our God, and trustworthy are your words. O faithful, living, and enduring, may you constantly rule over us forever and ever.&quot; This response apparently was in use in antiquity - the Jews of the eastern diaspora would recite this while seated, the Jews of Eretz Yisrael would stand. This practice appears to have ceased during the Middle Ages: it is not in Amram&#x27;s prayerbook of the 9th century although a phrase of it [&quot;Trustworthy are you &quot;Lord&quot; our God, living and enduring forever&quot;, right after &quot;words are true and just&quot;] is in the &quot;Mahzor Vitry &quot;, (ca. 1100), but in the 18th century Rabbi Jacob Emden criticized its omission. The second half of the blessing echoes Isaiah 45:23 and 55:11.

The third blessing follows immediately:
&lt;poem&gt;Be merciful to Zion, because it is the home of our life,
And save the downtrodden soon, in our own days.
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;, who makes glad the children of Zion [&quot;or:&quot; makes Zion to rejoice in her children].
:::[&quot;congregation&quot;: Amen.]&lt;/poem&gt;
Very similar to Massekhet Soferim, paragraph 11, which begins &quot;Comfort [&quot;Nahem&quot;, instead of &quot;rahem&quot; ], &quot;Lord&quot; our God, Zion your city...&quot;   and ends &quot;who comforts the children of Zion.&quot; Zion means Mount Zion, the hill in Jerusalem on which the Temple stood, although it had been destroyed centuries before this blessing was composed. It is possible that Mount Zion is mentioned formerly to deliberately refute the Samaritans, who centered their devotion to Mount Gerizim instead of Mount Zion. Instead of &quot;save&quot; (&quot;toshiya&quot;) the downtrodden, Massekhet Soferim has &quot;avenge&quot; (&quot;tenikum&quot;), which is used in the Yemenite version of the blessing. By the time of Amram Gaon (9th century) and Saadiah Gaon (10th century), as well as &quot;Mahzor Vitry&quot; (ca. 1100), &#x27;be merciful&#x27; had replaced &#x27;comfort&#x27; - but &#x27;avenge&#x27; was still part of the text—and into the last century was still part of both Romaniot and Yemenite versions. It has been suggested that &quot;save&quot; replaced &quot;avenge&quot; in so many communities because of Christian and Moslem censorship or intimidation.

The fourth blessing follows immediately:
&lt;poem&gt;Make us glad, &quot;Lord&quot;  our God,
with the Prophet Elijah, your servant,
and with the kingdom of the house of David, your anointed,
May he arrive soon and bring joy to our hearts.
Let no stranger sit upon his throne,
Nor let others continue to usurp his glory.
For you swore by your holy name that through all eternity his lamp will never go dark.
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;, shield of David.
:::[&quot;congregation&quot;: Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;

This is virtually identical to the text in Massekhet Soferim, paragraph 12, until the last line. Before the second &quot;Blessed are you&quot;, Soferim contains the line: &quot;And in his days may Judah be made safe, and Israel to dwell securely, and he shall be called, &#x27; is our vindicator&#x27;.&quot; This line remained in Romaniot liturgy. Instead of &quot;Shield of David&quot;, Soferim has &quot;who brings to fruition the mighty salvation of his people Israel.&quot; But by the 3rd century, &quot;shield of David&quot; was the text in use, predating Soferim. &quot;He&quot; and &quot;his&quot; refer to the Messiah, a descendant of King David. The lines &quot;let no stranger sit on his throne&quot; and &quot;others continue to usurp his glory&quot; might date back to the earliest Talmudic times, when the Hasmoneans and Herodians, rather than true descendants of the royal house of David, were rulers of the Holy Land.

The fifth (final) blessing follows immediately:
&lt;poem&gt;For the Torah reading, and for the worship service, and for [the reading from] the Prophets,
And for this Sabbath day [&quot;or:&quot; for this (&quot;holiday&quot;)], which you have given us, &quot;Lord&quot; our God,
For holiness and for respite, for honor and for splendor,
For all of this, &quot;Lord&quot; our God,
We gratefully thank you, and bless you.
May your name be blessed by every living mouth,
Always and forever.
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;, who sanctifies the Sabbath.
:::[&quot;congregation&quot;: Amen.]
&lt;/poem&gt;

This is from paragraph 13 of Soferim, which does not contain the phrase &quot;by every living mouth&quot;, and which concludes with &quot;who sanctifies Israel and the Day of [holiday name].&quot; Amram Gaon and Maimonides concluded with &quot;who rebuilds Jerusalem,&quot; but this appears to have been discarded by all factions. This final blessing is modified for the various festivals and holidays. In all traditions that last phrase, &quot;who sanctifies the Sabbath&quot;, is replaced by the appropriate substitute when the occasion is something other than an ordinary Sabbath, if a holiday falling on a Sabbath the phrasing is &quot;And for this Sabbath day and for this day of this...&quot; (if not on a Sabbath, then merely &quot;and for this day of ...&quot;); e.g. (for Passover) &quot;Festival of Matzos&quot;, (on Shavuos) &quot;Festival of Shavuos&quot;, (on Succos) &quot;Festival of Succos, (on Shemini Atzeres or Simhas Torah) &quot;Festival of the Assembly&quot;, (on Rosh Hashana) &quot;Day of Remembrance&quot;, (on Yom Kippur) &quot;Day of Atonement&quot;, - but it appears from Kol Bo (14th century) that Yom Kippur is the only fast day with a name and therefore this final blessing is not recited at all on other fast days, such as Gedaliah or Esther or Tisha B&#x27;Av, since they have no such names that can be inserted into the blessing - and then the festival version of the blessing concludes:
&lt;poem&gt;
 &quot;... which you have given us, &quot;Lord&quot; our God, [(&quot;on Sabbaths&quot;) for holiness and respite,]
     for gladness and joy [&quot;on Yom Kippur this is replaced with&quot;: for pardon, forgiveness, and atonement],
     for honor and splendor.
For all this &quot;Lord&quot; our God we thank you and praise you.
May your name be blessed by every living mouth, always and forever.
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;, who sanctifies [the Sabbath and] Israel and the Festivals.&quot;
&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;And on Yom Kippur, replace the last line with&quot; :
&lt;poem&gt;
Blessed are you &quot;Lord&quot;,
     the King who pardons and forgives our sins and the sins of his people, the family of Israel,
     and who removes our iniquities year after year,
King over all the earth, who sanctifies [the Sabbath,] Israel, and the Day of Atonement.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Customs==
In ancient times the haftara, like the Torah, was translated into Aramaic as it was read, and this is still done by Yemenite Jews. The Talmud rules that, while the Torah must be translated verse by verse, it is permissible to translate other readings (such as the Haftara) in units of up to three verses at a time.

Haftarot must have something in common with the day. On an ordinary Sabbath, this would mean that they have something in common with the Torah reading. However, the connection can be quite vague; the relevance for the parashah Bamidbar (addressing a census of Israel) is that the haftorah beginning that the people of Israel will be numerous like the sand of the sea.

The Talmud also says that the haftara should be at least 21 verses in length, to match the minimal Torah reading, but if the &quot;topic finished&quot; (&quot;salik inyana&quot;) applies this requirement is not necessary. Thus, the haftara for Ki Teitzei for Ashkenazim and Sephardim is only 10 verses; and the haftara for Miketz is, for Ashkenazim and Sephardim only 15 verses, and for Italian Jews only 14 verses. The Tosefta mentions a haftara in antiquity (before the 2nd century CE) that was just one verse, namely Isaiah 52:3, and some others that were only four or five verses. 

Another rule is that the haftara reading should not end on a macabre or distressing verse, and therefore either the penultimate verse is repeated at the very end or else verses from elsewhere are used as a coda, such as with the haftara for Tzav (Ashkenazim and Sephardim skip ahead in the same prophet to avoid concluding with the description of the dire fate of the wicked, a total of 19 verses; Chabad and Yemenite also skip ahead to avoid concluding with a different disquieting verse, a total of 16 verses; Karaites and Romaniote go back and repeat the penultimate verse, promising the reappearance of Elijah, rather than end with the word &quot;desolation&quot; - and the same applies when most communities read that haftarah on &quot;Shabbat Hagadol&quot; ). Among the consistent characteristics is that entire verses are read; never is only a part of a verse read.

In antiquity there was no prescribed list of haftara readings for the year, although the Talmudic literature (including the Midrash and Tosefta) does report some recommendations for specific holidays. It would appear that, in antiquity, the choice of portion from the Prophets was made &quot;ad hoc&quot;, without regard for the choice of previous years or of other congregations, either by the reader or by the congregation or its leaders; this is evidenced by recommendations in Talmudic literature that certain passages should not be chosen for haftara readings, which indicates that, to that time, that a regular list for the year&#x27;s readings did not exist. Further evidence of the lack of an ancient authoritative list of readings is the simple fact that, while the practice of reading a haftara every Sabbath and most holy days is ubiquitous, the different traditions and communities around the world have by now adopted differing lists, indicating that no solid tradition from antiquity dictated the haftara selections for a majority of the ordinary Sabbaths.

==Cantillation==
The &quot;haftara&quot; is read with cantillation according to a unique melody (not with the same cantillation melody as the Torah). The tradition to read &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; with its own special melody is attested to in late medieval sources, both Ashkenazic and Sephardic. A medieval Sephardic source notes that the melody for the &quot;haftarot&quot; is a slight variation of the tune used for reading the books of Nevi&#x27;im in general (presumably for study purposes), and Jews of Iraqi origin to this day preserve separate &quot;Neviim&quot; and &quot;Haftara&quot; melodies.

Note that although many selections from Nevi&#x27;im are read as &quot;haftarot&quot; over the course of the year, the books of Nevi&#x27;im are &quot;not&quot; read in their entirety (as opposed to the Torah). Since Nevi&#x27;im as a whole is not covered in the liturgy, the melodies for certain rare cantillation notes which appear in the books of Nevi&#x27;im but not in the &quot;haftarot&quot; have been forgotten. For more on this, see Nevi&#x27;im.

As a generality, although the Torah was chanted in a major key (ending in a minor key), the haftara is chanted in a minor key (as is the blessing before the reading of the haftara) and ends in a pentatonic mode (and the blessings following the haftara reading are also pentatonic).

The Haftarot for the morning of Tisha b&#x27;Av, and for the Shabbat preceding it, are, in many synagogues, predominantly read to the cantillation melody used for the public reading of the Book of Lamentations, or &quot;Eicha.&quot; In the German tradition, the Haftara for the morning of Tisha b&#x27;Av, as well as the Torah reading then, are read without cantillation at all, but rather with a melancholic melody.

Leonard Bernstein employed the Haftara cantillation melody extensively as a theme in the second movement (&quot;Profanation&quot;) of his Symphony No. 1 (&quot;Jeremiah&quot;).

==On Sabbath afternoon==
Some Rishonim, including Rabbenu Tam, report that a custom in the era of the Talmud was to read a haftara at the &quot;mincha&quot; service each Sabbath afternoon — but that this haftara was from the &quot;Ketuvim&quot; rather than from the &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot;. Most halachic authorities maintain that that was not the custom in Talmudic times, and that such a custom should not be followed. In the era of the Geonim, some communities, including some in Persia, read a passage from &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; (whether or not in the form of a haftara) Sabbath afternoons. Although this practice is virtually defunct, most halachic authorities maintain that there is nothing wrong with it.

Rabbi Reuven Margolies claims that the now-widespread custom of individuals&#x27; reciting Psalm 111 after the Torah reading Sabbath afternoon derives from the custom reported by &quot;Rabbenu&quot; &quot;Tam&quot;. Louis Ginzberg makes the analogous claim for the custom of reciting Psalm 91 in &quot;Motza&#x27;ei Shabbat&quot;.

==As a &quot;B&#x27;nai Mitzvah&quot; ritual==
In many communities the &quot;haftara&quot; is read by a Bar Mitzvah or Bat Mitzvah at his or her respective ceremonies, along with some, all, or, sometimes none of the Torah portion. This is often referred to, mainly in Hebrew schools and &quot;bar&quot; preparatory programs, as a &quot;haftara portion&quot;.

The reading of the &quot;haftara&quot; by the Bar Mitzvah is a relatively new custom, since it is not derived from either Bible nor Talmud. According to the Talmud, the lesson from the Prophets may be read by a minor (i.e., a boy younger than 13), if he is sufficiently educated to do it. A tradition that might have dated back to medieval times was that a boy would read the &quot;haftara&quot; on the Sabbath &quot;prior&quot; to his Bar Mitzvah, and on the day of his Bar Mitzvah read the portion from the Torah but not the &quot;haftara&quot;; this custom changed, in the United States, in the late 19th century or early 20th century, when the Bar Mitzvah would read both the Torah and &quot;haftara&quot; on the Sabbath immediately following his 13th birthday. The custom of the Bar Mitzvah reading the &quot;haftara&quot; is so recent that the appropriate procedure for a &quot;haftara&quot; reading when two boys are Bar Mitzvah on the same day is still unresolved.

==List of &quot;Haftarot&quot;==
The selections of haftarot readings for the various weeks and holy days of the year differs from tradition to tradition - Ashkenazic from Sefardic from Yemenite from Mizrachi, etc. And even within a tradition there is no one authoritative list, but a multitude of different lists from different communities and congregations, usually differing from each other by only one or two haftarot. A study of the antiquity of each of these lists, and how they differ from each other, is beyond the scope of this (or any other brief) article but may be most informative on the history (including the contacts and separations) of the various communities. The list compiled by Rabbi Eli Duker contains many historical customs that did not survive until the present day.

The selection from &quot;Nevi&#x27;im&quot; [the Prophets] read as the &quot;haftara&quot; is not always the same in all Jewish communities. When customs differ, this list indicates them as follows: &quot;A&quot;=Ashkenazic custom (&quot;AF&quot;=Frankfurt am Main; &quot;AH&quot;=Chabad; &quot;AP&quot;= Poland; APZ = Posen;); &quot;I&quot;=Italian custom; &quot;S&quot;=Sephardic and Mizrahi custom (&quot;SM&quot;=Maghreb [North Africa]; &quot;SZ&quot;= Mizrahi [Middle and Far East]); &quot;Y&quot;=Yemenite custom; &quot;R&quot;=Romaniote (Byzantine, eastern Roman empire, extinct) custom; and &quot;K&quot;=Karaite custom. In several instances, authorities did not agree on the readings of various communities.

Because, in the Diaspora, certain holy days and festivals are observed for an additional day, which day is not so observed in Eretz Yisrael, sometimes different haftarot are read simultaneously inside and outside Eretz Yisrael. On the converse, it is possible for a different Torah portion to be read in Israel and the Diaspora, but the same Haftarah.

:(According to the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, if Rosh Hodesh &quot;Elul&quot; - which has its own haftara, namely Isaiah 66 - coincides with Shabbat Re&#x27;eh, the haftara of Re&#x27;eh, not for Rosh Hodesh Elul, is read because the Seven Sabbaths of Consolation must not be interrupted. However, the Rama disagrees, and most Ashkenazic communities read the haftorah for Shabbat Rosh Chodesh, since it too has words of consolation. Some communities, such as Frankfurt am Main read the Haftorah for &quot;Machar Chodesh&quot; when Rosh Chodesh elul falls on Sunday.)

====&quot;Vayelech&quot; (31:1-30)====
:(It appears that Vayelech has no haftara portion of its own, because Vayelech either takes the haftara of Shabbat Shuvah or the haftara of Netzavim. If Shabbat Shuvah coincides with Haazinu, which usually happens, the parashah of Vayelech is shifted to the week of Netzavim; otherwise Vayelech falls between Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur and so the haftara for Shabbat Shuva is read. Several editions - e.g., Hirsch, Hertz, ArtScroll - have assigned the Shabbat Shuva reading as the customary haftara for Vayelech, some others - such as the IDF and JPS1985 - have no haftara listed specifically for Vayelech.)

===Special Sabbaths, festivals, and fast days===
In general, on the dates below, the haftarot below are read, even if that entails overriding the haftara for a Sabbath Torah portion. However, in certain communities, the first two haftarot below (that for Rosh Hodesh and that for the day preceding Rosh Hodesh) are replaced by the regular weekly haftara when the weekly reading is &quot;Masei&quot;(occurring in mid-summer) or later. Some of these occasions also have specific Torah readings, which (for A and S) are noted parenthetically.

*Sabbath coinciding with Rosh Hodesh, except Rosh Hodesh of the months of Adar, Nisan, Tevet, or (in some communities) Av or Elul; and except Rosh Hashanah
::(Torah reading: Numbers 28:9-15, acc to JPS, Hirsch, Soncino Chumash; Numbers 28:1-15, acc to Hertz, ArtScroll)

:*Y, AH: Isaiah 66:1–24 &amp; repeat 66:23
:*a few Djerba: Isaiah 66:5-24 &amp; repeat 66:23
*Sabbath coinciding with the day preceding Rosh Chodesh, (known as &quot;Machar Hodesh&quot; ), except Rosh Hodesh of the months of Nisan, Tevet, Adar, or (in most communities) Elul and except Rosh Hashanah
**First Samuel 20:18-42 (which begins, &quot;Tomorrow is the new moon...&quot;)
*** Fez (acc to Dotan): additionally read the regular Haftara.

[The holidays and special Sabbaths are listed in their usual sequence during the year, starting with &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; ]
*First day of &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; (Torah reading: Genesis chap. 21 and Numbers 29:1-6)
**A, S: First Samuel 1:1–2:20
**I, Y, AH (and A and S acc to Benisch): First Samuel 1:1–2:10
**R: First Samuel 2:1-2:21
**K: Joel 2:15-2:27
*Second day of &quot;Rosh Hashanah&quot; (Torah reading: Genesis chap. 22 and Numbers 29:1-6)
**A, AH, S, Y: Jeremiah 31:1–19 (Benisch begins at 31:2, because Benisch is referring to the non-Hebrew numeration of the book of Jeremiah)
**I: Jeremiah 31:1–20
**R: Jeremiah 31:19-31;29   (some R continue to verse 31:35)
**Baghdad: Jeremiah 30:25-31:19
*Fast of Gedaliah, afternoon haftara (there is no morning haftara)
**A, Y, AH, some S, some SM: Isaiah 55:6–56:8   (same as used on minchah of 9th of Av)
**I: Hosea 14:2–10
**(acc to Dotan, most Sephardic congregations have no haftara for Fast of Gedalia)
*Sabbath before &quot;Yom Kippur&quot; (&quot;Shabbat Shuvah&quot;) (Either Nitzavim-Vayeilech or Haazinu) 
**Hosea 14:2-10. Also, some communities add either Joel 2:15 (or 2:11)–27 or Micah 7:18–20. Hirsch says, because the Hosea reading ends on a sad note, A added the passage from Joel, S added the one from Micah. However, many communities nowadays add both these passages.
**R, (Y, acc to Jerusalem Crown): Hosea 14:2-10
**(acc to Hirsch as &quot;prevalent custom&quot;) A, S: Hosea 14:2-10, Micah 7:18-20, Joel 2:11-27 (Dotan notes that this is done in &quot;some communities&quot; although contrary to the halachic practice) (ArtScroll has Joel as second, Micah as last; Dotan notes this is used in &quot;a few communities&quot;, Hirsch says this is the practice in Eretz Yisrael.)
**(acc to Hertz) A, S: Hosea 14:2-10, Micah 7:18-20, Joel 2:15-27
**A (acc to Dotan, Koren, Hirsch, Jerusalem Crown, Lindo): Hosea 14:2–10, and Joel 2:15–27 (Benisch lists this as the A haftara for Haazinu)
**S (acc to Dotan, Koren, Hirsch, Benisch, Lindo, &amp; Jerusalem Crown), &amp; AH: Hosea 14:2–10, and Micah 7:18–20 
**The choice of the reading from Hosea is almost universal because its opening words are &quot;Shuvah Yisrael&quot; - &quot;Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God&quot;. &quot;Some few congregations&quot; (according to ArtScroll) read Isaiah 55:6–56:8 (the haftara associated with Vayelech and with the minchah of fast days) instead; this is also mentioned as one option in the Posen book. (Some lists or books have no specific entry for Shabbat Shuva, leading to the supposition that the haftara usually associated with the week&#x27;s parashah - usually Vayelech - is to be read; and some apply a more complex exchange of haftarot if there is - as often occurs - a Sabbath in the four days between Yom Kippur and the beginning of &quot;Sukkot&quot;;in which case that Sabbath is Parashat Haazinu.)
*&quot;Yom Kippur&quot;, morning haftara (Torah reading: Leviticus chap. 16 and Numbers 29:7-11)
**A, S, AH: Isaiah 57:14–58:14 (R begin at 57:15)
**Y, I: Isaiah 57:14-58:14 &amp; 59:20-21
*&quot;Yom Kippur&quot;, afternoon haftara (Torah reading: Leviticus chap. 18)

**I: Obadiah 1:21, the entire Book of Jonah, and Micah 7:18–20
*First day of &quot;Sukkot&quot; (Torah reading: Leviticus 22:26-23:44 and Numbers 29:12-16)

**Y, I: First Kings 7:51–8:16
*Sabbath of the intermediate days of &quot;Sukkot&quot; (&quot;Shabbat Hol Hamoed Sukkot&quot;) (Torah reading: Exodus 33:12-34:26 and the appropriate reading from Numbers 29)

**A, AH, I: Joshua 1:1–18
**S, Y: Joshua 1:1–9 (Y add verse 6:27) (some S follow this with the haftara used for a bridegroom [Isaiah 61:10-62:8].)
**R: First Kings 8:22–34 (this is the reading originally assigned by the Talmud for this day.)
*First (or only) Sabbath of &quot;Hanukkah&quot;
::(This haftara is recommended in the Talmud (&quot;Megillah&quot; 31a), in all traditions, includes Zechariah 3:2, which contains the very rarely used cantillation accent of &quot;mercha kefula&quot;, under &quot;zeh&quot; - &quot;this [burning stick]&quot;. It appears there was an ancient custom to read, or to read additionally, First Kings 7:51-8:21, describing the dedication of the first Temple.)
:*A, S, AH: Zechariah 2:14–4:7
:*Y: Zechariah 2:14–4:9 
*Second Sabbath of &quot;Hanukkah&quot;
**A, S, Y, I: First Kings 7:40–50 (this is also the A haftara for Vayakhel, which is also very seldom read (it&#x27;s only read in leap years when the preceding Rosh Hashanah was a Thursday) because it often coincides with Pekudei or with a special Sabbath, and in fact the two readings of this haftara will never occur in the same year.)
**R: First Kings 7:27–47
*Sabbath immediately preceding the second day of Adar (or of Second Adar) (Shabbat Shekalim): ° (Torah reading: Exodus 30:11-16)
**A, Y: Second Kings 12:1–17    (this is the selection recommended in the Talmud, &quot;Megillah &quot; 29b)
**S, AH: Second Kings 11:17–12:17 
**R, K: Ezekiel 45:12-46:5 (° The first of four Sabbaths preceding Passover. It occurs on the Sabbath that either coincides with the New Moon, or precedes the New Moon that occurs during the following week, of the month of Second Adar — or of Adar in an ordinary year. These four Sabbaths may be the oldest assigned haftarot, from Tosefta, &quot;Megillah&quot; ch.4.)

**No special haftara:   the usual haftara for that week&#x27;s parashah is read.

::(° If Rosh Hodesh Nisan coincides with Parashat Hahodesh, then the haftara for Hahodesh, not for Rosh Hodesh, is read because the obligation of this special parashah is greater. Dotan says that if Shabbat Hahodesh coincides with Rosh Hodesh, then S and SZ add to the Hahodesh haftara the first and last verses of the haftara of Rosh Hodesh [namely, Isaiah 66:1 &amp; 66:23], if Shabbat Hahodesh falls on the day before Rosh Hodesh, then they add the first and last verses of the haftara for the Eve of Rosh Hodesh [namely First Samuel 20:18 &amp; 20:42].)
*Sabbath immediately preceding Passover (&quot;Shabbat HaGadol&quot;)
**Malachi 3:4-24 &amp; repeat 3:23 
***Y, some AH, AF, some SM: read the regular haftara for that week°
::°The Levush records that &quot;some communities&quot; read the special haftara only when Erev Pesach falls on Shabbat Hagadol (meaning the first seder is celebrated that Saturday night) - which occurs infrequently, and &quot;other communities&quot; (practice of the Vilna Gaon, cited in Maase Rav) read the special haftara on Shabbat HaGadol only if Erev Pesach falls on another day of the week. Erev Pesach falls on Shabbat HaGadol in the spring of 1994, 2001, 2005, 2008, 2021, 2025, 2045, 2048, 2052, 2072, 2075, 2079, and 2099.

<doc id="632369" wikidata="Q79608" url="?curid=632369" title="Google Toolbar">
<text>Google Toolbar was a web browser toolbar for Internet Explorer, developed by Google. It was first released in 2000 for Internet Explorer 5 and above. Google Toolbar was also distributed as a Mozilla plug-in for Firefox from September 2005 to June 2011. On December 12, 2021, the software was no longer available for download, and the main website now redirects to a support page, though a page still exists with the original page design.

== Features ==
Google Toolbar resided above the browser&#x27;s tab bar and provided a search box to carry out web searches. Users could log into their Gmail accounts and access their email, saved bookmarks, and web history. It had tools such as AutoLink, AutoFill, Translation, and spell checker on all browsers. The pop-up blocker and word finder were restricted to Internet Explorer. Google Toolbar was often distributed through product bundling with a primary download.

=== Sidewiki ===
Google Sidewiki was launched on September 23, 2009, allowing users to make comments, which were visible to the public, on any web page. Google used ranking algorithms to determine comment relevancy and usefulness using criteria such as users voting up and down a comment and past contributions. Sidewiki was available for Internet Explorer and Firefox through Google Toolbar, the Google Chrome browser through an add-on, and for other browsers, like Safari, it was available as a bookmarklet.

Web site owners could not control Sidewiki comments, and there was no way for a web site to opt out of Sidewiki; however, Sidewiki was disabled on secure sites.

In September 2011, Google announced that it would discontinue Sidewiki.

=== My Location ===
My Location was a geolocation service which uses the location of Wi-Fi access points to determine the toolbar user&#x27;s location. This location was used to optimize search results based on where the user was located. Google Toolbar could also provide the geolocation data to third-party websites through the W3C Geolocation API.

=== AutoLink ===
Google Toolbar was criticized when the AutoLink feature was added to the toolbar because this new feature directed users to pre-selected commercial websites. For example, if it found a book&#x27;s ISBN on a webpage, it provided a link to Amazon&#x27;s product page for the particular book. Google said that the feature &quot;adds useful links&quot; and &quot;none of the companies which received AutoLinks had paid for the service.&quot;

=== Web caching ===
The desktop version of Google Toolbar showed the cached copy of any given search result, which was useful for slower Internet connections and benefitted by Google Web Accelerator until its discontinuation in 2008. This feature does not exist for the mobile version.

== Privacy ==
Google Watch has raised concerns about Google Toolbar&#x27;s possible threats to privacy, such as tracking of browsing patterns, automatic installation of updates without the user&#x27;s knowledge, and a privacy policy that can be revised without notice. The toolbar does not track personally identifiable surfing activities of the end user unless advanced features such as PageRank are specifically enabled by the user. It does track &quot;anonymous&quot; statistics, which can reveal a lot of information when correlated with other data, although similar criticisms could be made of Google&#x27;s online search engine.

== Google Compute ==
Google Compute was a separately downloadable add-on for the Google Toolbar which utilized the user&#x27;s computer to help the Folding@home distributed computing project, which studies disease-relevant protein folding and other molecular dynamics. It was founded in March 2002 by Google co-founder Sergey Brin. Functionally, it downloaded a small packet of work, performed calculations on it, and uploaded it back to Stanford University. Although it was limited in functionality and scope, it increased Folding@home&#x27;s participation from 10,000 up to about 30,000 active CPUs. The program ended in October 2005 in favor of the project&#x27;s official clients, and is no longer available for the Toolbar.

== Discontinuation ==
On December 12, 2021, Google Toolbar was quietly shut down by Google. The website redirected to Toolbar Support, stating the user should install Google Chrome instead, and showed instructions on how to uninstall Toolbar for those on Internet Explorer. Computers that still have Google Toolbar are not affected. It now redirects to Chrome Support.

<doc id="632370" wikidata="Q4351756" url="?curid=632370" title="Kapenta">
<text>The Tanganyika sardine is a term for two related species (Lake Tanganyika sardine, &quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot; and Lake Tanganyika sprat, &quot;Stolothrissa tanganicae&quot;), both of which are small, planktivorous, pelagic, freshwater clupeid originating from Lake Tanganyika in Zambia. They form the major biomass of pelagic fish in Lake Tanganyika and Lake Malawi, swimming in large schools in the open lake, feeding on copepods and potentially jellyfish. Their major predators are four species of &quot;Lates&quot; which are also endemic to Lake Tanganyika, and are related to (but not the same as) the Nile perch in Lake Victoria. All of these pelagic fish have suffered from overfishing in the last two decades.

The fish is known as kapenta or matemba in Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe, &quot;Ndagala&quot; or &quot;Lumpu” in Burundi and Isambaza in Rwanda.
(A related but different fish, known as dagaa or ndaga, is &quot;Rastrineobola argentea&quot;.)

&quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot; has been successfully introduced in both natural and artificial African lakes. Large kapenta fisheries now take place in the Lake Kariba (Zambia/Zimbabwe) and Cahora Bassa (Mozambique).

&quot;Limnothrissa miodon&quot; is usually around 10 cm long, its maximum length is 17 cm. &quot;Stolothrissa tanganicae&quot; is smaller at 7 cm (maximum 10 cm).

==Fishing==

This fish is caught at night using kapenta rigs; these rigs use LED lights or kerosene lamps to attract the fish to the rig. A dip net measuring roughly six metres in diameter and around 8 to 10 metres in length is then used to bring the fish up from anything from 40 metres (130 ft).

===Sustainability===
In recent years there has been a steady decline in the kapenta population. In order to maintain the kapenta population certain countries have made it illegal to fish for kapenta in shallow water (less than 20 metres), as the kapenta breed in this shallow water, and have introduced licences to control and monitor fishing.

==Food==
Kapenta is usually dried in the sun on a clean surface such as concrete slabs, rocks or netting. Drying on racks gives the best results. Drying takes one day or more, depending on the weather. Unfortunately, the kapenta season coincides with the rainy season when the fish congregates, and sundrying may not always be possible, causing post-harvest losses. These losses are mostly economical as lower-quality dried fish fetches a lower price. In the worst case the dried fish is used as chicken feed. Salting before drying is a solution: kapenta is salted at a ratio normally of 2.5 kg per 30 kg (1 lb per 12 lb) of fish, and dried in the hot Zambezi Valley sun. It is a highly important staple, providing refrigeration-free protein to people of Africa. A cup of dried kapenta will feed a family. Dried kapenta is preferred to the slightly bitter dried dagaa from Lake Victoria, but poor people will buy dagaa because of its lower price.

In Zimbabwe, dried kapenta fish are shallow-fried with onions, tomatoes and groundnut powder. They are eaten with the traditional staple cornmeal dish called isitshwala or sadza.

Fresh kapenta is also packed in plastic pouches and frozen. Frozen kapenta is popular but more expensive than dried kapenta. Fresh kapenta is not sold in markets, except in fishing villages.

In the 1960s and 1970s, some fishery development projects experimented with smoke-dried kapenta, salted or not, but this never caught on.

Marinated kapenta can be made from kapenta fillets put in vinegar with salt and kept in a refrigerator. After two or three days the vinegar is discarded and the fish is quickly rinsed with clean water. Then the fillets are put in a mix of olive oil, vinegar, sugar, garlic, chili peppers, and much parsley or celery. After another two or three days in the fridge, the marinated fillets are ready to eat.

It is an important bait fish for the African tigerfish (family Alestidae) and, although introduced in Kariba and Cahora Bassa, does not seem to have harmed the environment.

It is an important contributor to the economies of the areas it is caught in.

<text>Ibadi Islam (, ) is a school of Islam concentrated in Oman established from within the Kharijites. The followers of the Ibadi sect are known as the Ibadis or, as they call themselves, The People of Truth and Integrity ().

Ibadism emerged around 60 years after the Islamic prophet Muhammad&#x27;s death in AD 632 as a moderate school of the Khawarij movement, although contemporary Ibadis may object to being classified as Kharijites. Ibadis are smaller than the two largest Muslim denominations: Sunnis—who account for 90 percent of the Muslim world—and Shias.

Today, the largest of these communities is in Oman, where they constitute the majority. It is also practiced to a lesser extent in Algeria (Mzab), Tunisia (Djerba), Libya (Nafusa), and Tanzania (Zanzibar).

== History ==

===Background===
The Ibadis began as a moderate branch of the Kharijites, an Islamic sect that split from the Muhakkima and al-Haruriyya. These groups initially supported Ali during the First Fitna but turned away after rejecting arbitration at the Battle of Siffin in AD 657. From the Ibadis&#x27; perspective, the Muhakkimah were the only faction striving to restore the just Islamic Imamate, as it existed during the time of Abu Bakr, &#x27;Umar, the first six years of &#x27;Uthman&#x27;s rule, and the early years of &#x27;Ali before he accepted arbitration.

The Muhakkimah&#x27;s military efforts ended with their massacre by &#x27;Ali b. Abi Talib and his forces at the Battle of al-Nahr (37 H/AD 658), followed by another massacre at al-Nakhilah by the joint forces of Mu&#x27;awiyah and al-Hasan b. &#x27;Ali. After these events, the Umayyad rule became firmly established and focused on suppressing all forms of opposition. As a result, sympathizers of the Muhakkimah—referred to as &#x27;al-Muslimun&#x27; or &#x27;Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimin&#x27; in early Ibadhi literature—were forced to hide their faith and conduct their activities in secret.

Among the survivors of the Battle of al-Nahrawan were &#x27;Urwah b. &#x27;Udayyah and his brother Abu Bilal Mirdas. They continued their religious activities in Basrah, where they were known for their devotion and became leading members of the &#x27;Jama&#x27;at al-Muslimin&#x27;. Abu Bilal was particularly influential in Basrah and was one of three men who openly commented on the first sermon of Ziyad b. Abih when Ziyad was appointed governor of Basrah, Khurasan, and Sijistan by Mu&#x27;awiyah.

It is also recorded that Abu Bilal maintained close ties with Jabir b. Zaid, often spending significant time with him. Together, they visited &#x27;A&#x27;ishah and reproached her for her role in the Battle of the Camel. During this period, Jabir&#x27;s leadership of the Muhakkimah became well established. A learned and pious man from the al-Azd tribe—the same tribe as &#x27;Abdullah b. Wahb al-Rasibi, the last elected leader of the Muhakkimah—Jabir focused on intellectual activities. His scholarly approach allowed him to propagate and preserve Islamic teachings without arousing the suspicion of the Umayyad authorities. His position as a prominent mufti in Basrah provided him with cover and enabled him to form widespread connections with influential individuals across the Islamic world.

The Ibadi school eventually emerged as a moderate group in Basrah, grounded in the teachings of Jabir ibn Zayd, who, according to the Ibadis (perhaps posthumously), became their first imam. After the Battle of Siffin, the Kharijites engaged in ongoing conflicts with both Alid and Umayyad supporters, often inciting local rebellions against Umayyad rule. Following the Second Fitna in AD 680, the Kharijites split into four main groups with varying levels of extremism. One significant division was led by Ibn al-&#x27;Azraq, who introduced doctrines that were rejected by leaders such as Jabir b. Zaid and Abdullah b. Ibadh, who upheld the original principles of the Muhakkima, according to Ibadhi tradition.

===Kharijite split===
The Ibadi school of Kharijites emerged after the siege of Mecca in AD 683, during the second Muslim civil war. Abd Allāh ibn Ibāḍ was part of a group of Basran Kharijites, led by Nafi ibn al-Azraq, who initially supported the defenders of Mecca against the Umayyads. However, they became disillusioned when the Meccan Caliph, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr, refused to denounce the late Caliph Uthmān. Disappointed, they returned to Basra, where they were imprisoned by the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad.

When Basra overthrew Umayyad rule in support of Ibn al-Zubayr in late AD 683 or early 684, the Kharijite prisoners were freed. After their release, Ibn al-Azraq led many Kharijites to Ahvaz in Khuzestan, condemning the Basrans for supporting Ibn al-Zubayr and calling them &quot;polytheists.&quot; However, Ibn Ibāḍ stayed behind in Basra and defended those who remained. He argued that the Basrans were not polytheists but guilty only of &quot;ingratitude&quot; (kufr ni&#x27;ma), a lesser offense that allowed true Muslims to live among them.

Ibn Ibāḍ also opposed other Kharijite factions. He rejected the views of ʿAbd Allāh ibn al-Ṣaffār, founder of the Sufri sect, and clashed with Abū Bayhas, leader of the Bayhasiyya sect, whose views were closer to the radical doctrines of Ibn al-Azraq.

The Ibadis distanced themselves from more extreme Kharijite beliefs, particularly on two key issues:

# Khuruj (Revolt): Nafi ibn al-Azraq argued that hijrah (emigration) or khuruj (armed revolt) was mandatory and declared that Muslim opponents lived in &quot;lands of war&quot; (dar al-harb). He also labeled those who did not participate in revolt (al-qa&#x27;adah) as idolaters. In contrast, the Ibadis, following the early Muhakkimah doctrine, believed their Muslim opponents were &quot;infidels-in-gratitude&quot; (kuffar), not polytheists, and that hijrah was not obligatory. They allowed Muslims to live among their opponents and accepted that those who did not fight could still be considered supporters of the cause, with their inaction forgiven.
# Attitude Toward Muslim Opponents: The Azraqites took a harsh stance, viewing their Muslim opponents as idolaters, making it permissible to kill women and children, take captives, and seize property. They even forbade marrying their women or inheriting from them. In contrast, the Ibadis condemned these practices as violations of Islamic principles. Both Jabir ibn Zaid and Abd Allāh ibn Ibāḍ rejected these extremist views and opposed other radical Kharijite groups, such as the Sufriyah and Najdat, despite some differences between these groups and the Azraqites.

The Ibadis viewed the doctrines of Nafi and other extreme Kharijites as dangerous heresies (bida&#x27;a) and waged wars against them. Early Ibadhi writings, like the &quot;Sirah&quot; of Salim b. Dhakwan, reflect their opposition to extremism.

In Basra, a moderate Kharijite doctrine emerged under Jabir ibn Zayd, influenced by the teachings of Ibn Abbas. Missionaries spread this doctrine across the Caliphate, including to Oman, Yemen, Hadramawt, Khurasan, and North Africa. Despite their efforts, the Ibadi leaders in Basra practiced &quot;kitman&quot; (concealment of beliefs) to avoid persecution after the Umayyads retook control of the city under Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan in AD 691.

===Omani Imamate===
Jābir ibn Zayd was eventually recognised as the first Imam of the Ibadis although this was in a state of kitman. Ibn Zayd&#x27;s criticisms of the narrations of Muhammad&#x27;s companions formed the corpus of the Ibadi interpretation of Islamic law. The position of Ibadi Imam was elected, unlike the dynastic succession of the Sunnis and Shi&#x27;as, and was not exclusive, with individual communities encouraged to elect their Imam. These imams exercised political, spiritual and military functions.

In 745, Talib al-Haqq established the first Ibadi state in the Hadhramaut and succeeded in capturing Yemen in 746 from the Umayyad Caliphate. The Ibadi insurrection then spread to the Hejaz, with Abu Hamza al-Mukhtar conquering Mecca and Medina. In response, the Caliph Marwan II led a 4,000-strong army and routed the Ibadis first in Mecca, then in Sana&#x27;a in Yemen, and finally surrounded them in Shibam in the western Hadhramaut in 748, defeating and killing Abu Hamza and Ibn Yahya and destroying the first Ibadi state. Problems back in their heartland of Islamic Syria led the Umayyads to sign a peace accord with the Ibadis, who were allowed to retain a community in Shibam.

A second Ibadi state was established in Oman in 750, but fell to the newly formed Abbasid Caliphate in 752. Another Ibadi state was established in Oman in 793, surviving for a century until the Abbasid recapture in 893. However, Abbasid influence after reconquest was nominal and Ibadi imams continued to wield considerable power. Ibadi imamates were re-established in subsequent centuries. Ibadis still form the majority of the contemporary Omani population and the royal family of Oman are Ibadi.

===Further expansion===
Ibadi missionary activity was met with considerable success in North Africa. In 757, Ibadis seized Tripoli and captured Kairouan the next year. Driven out by the Abbasid army in 761, Ibadi leaders founded a state, which became known as Rustamid dynasty, in Tahart. It was overthrown in 909 by the Fatimid Caliphate. Ibadi communities continue to exist in the Nafusa Mountains in northwestern Libya, the island of Djerba in Tunisia, and in the M&#x27;zab in Algeria. In East Africa, they are found in Zanzibar. Ibadi missionary activity also reached Persia, India, Egypt, Sudan, Spain and Sicily, although Ibadis communities in these regions ceased to exist.

By the year 900, Ibadism had spread to Sindh, Khorosan, the Hadhramaut, Dhofar, the Imamate of Oman, Muscat, the Nafusa Mountains, and Qeshm, Hormozgan; by 1200, the sect was present in al-Andalus, Sicily, M&#x27;zab and the western part of the Sahel as well. In the 14th century, historian Ibn Khaldun made reference to vestiges of Ibadi influence in Hadhramaut, though the sect no longer exists in the region today.

== Views ==

Ibadis state that their school predates mainstream Islamic schools and some western non-Muslim writers agree. In particular, Donald Hawley&#x27;s view was that Ibadism should be considered an early and highly orthodox interpretation of Islam.

===Ibadi imamate and political theory===

Unlike the Sunni theory of the caliphate of the Rashidun, and the Shi&#x27;i notion of divinely appointed Imamate, the leaders of Ibadi Islam—called Imams—do not need to rule the entire Muslim world; Muslim communities are considered capable of ruling themselves. The Ibadis reject the belief that the leader of the Muslim community must be descended from the Quraysh tribe. (This differs from the Shia belief that ideally and eventually they will be ruled by the Mahdi, who will be descended from Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s Household (&quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot;)—Muhammad having been a member of the Quraysh tribe.) Rather, the two primary qualifications of an Ibadi imam are that he is the most pious man of the community and the most learned in &quot;fiqh&quot;, or Islamic jurisprudence; and that he has the military knowledge to defend the Ibadi community against war and oppression. In the Omani tradition, an imam who is learned in the Islamic legal sciences is considered &quot;strong&quot; (), and an imam whose primary skills are military without scholarly qualifications is considered &quot;weak&quot; (). Unlike a strong imam, a weak imam is obliged to consult the &quot;ulamāʾ&quot;, or community of scholars, before passing any judgement. A weak imam is appointed only at times of dire necessity, when the community is threatened with destruction.

Contemporary Ibadis uphold four &quot;states of the religion&quot; (), which are four different types of imams each appropriate to certain contexts. The &quot;Imam of secrecy&quot; is a learned scholar who &quot;rules&quot; in political quietism, practicing taqiyya to avoid persecution, in times when the Ibadi community cannot reveal itself openly. In some cases, a state of may be necessary even when there is no imam available. In this case, the Ibadi &quot;ulamāʾ&quot; takes over as surrogate rulers in place of the imam. This has been the case for most of the history of the North African Ibadis since the fall of the Rustumid imamate in 909, unlike their Omani coreligionists, who periodically reestablished imamates until 1958.

The second state, that of the &quot;Imam of exchange&quot;, are Ibadi imams who &quot;exchange&quot; their lives in the living world for a favorable place in the afterlife by engaging in military struggle (&quot;jihād&quot;) against an unbearable tyrannical authority with the goal of creating an Ibadi state. An example is the early Basran Kharijite leader Abu Bilal Mirdas, who was later held by the Ibadiyya to be a prototype of the &quot;Imam of exchange&quot;. A would-be cannot begin military action until they have found at least forty followers, as Abu Bilal had, willing to die for the cause; once the war has begun, the imam must continue to fight until there are only three followers remaining. A particularly ascetic lifestyle is required of the and his followers, as suggested in the following speech by Abu Bilal:

You go out to fight in the way of God desiring His pleasure, not wanting anything of the goods of the present world, nor have you any desire for it, nor will you return to it. You are the ascetic and the hater of this life, desirous of the world to come, trying with all in your power to obtain it: going out to be killed and for nothing else. So know that you are [already] killed and have no return to this life; you are going forward and will not turn away from righteousness till you come to God. If such is your concern, go back and finish up your needs and wishes for this life, pay your debts, purchase yourself, take leave of your family and tell them that you will never return to them.

The third state, that of the &quot;Imam of glory&quot;, are imams as active rulers of an Ibadi state. The first two caliphs Abu Bakr and Umar are considered ideal models of the . A ruling imam who sins must be removed from power; the Ibadi model for this is the assassination of the third caliph Uthman and the Kharijite revolt against Ali, both actions being viewed as legitimate resistance to a sinful ruler.

Finally, the state of the &quot;imam of defense&quot; involves appointing an imam for a predetermined period of time when the Ibadi community is under foreign attack. He is removed once the threat has been defeated.

===Views on other denominations===

Ibadis believe that all who profess the belief in oneness of God and belief in the prophethood of Muhammad as the last messenger are members of the Islamic community. It is the duty of Ibadis to correct those who differ with them in their beliefs. Only the righteous Ibadis, referred to as the &quot;people of uprightness&quot;, are worthy of being called &quot;Muslims&quot;. Non-Ibadi Muslims are termed the &quot;people of opposition&quot;. Nonetheless, non-Ibadi Muslims are still respected as fellow members of the &quot;ummah&quot; or wider Islamic community, who possess the various privileges accorded to Muslims in Islamic law and who Ibadis may intermarry with. All non-Ibadi Muslims and even Ibadi sinners are considered guilty of &quot;kufr&quot; (usually translated as &quot;unbelief&quot;), although contemporary Ibadis distinguish between &quot;kufr shirk&quot;, or religious disbelief, and &quot;kufr nifaq&quot;, or infidelity in the form of sinning. The term &quot;shirk&quot;—&quot;polytheism&quot; in conventional Islamic theology—has a wider use in Ibadi doctrine, where it is used to describe all forms of religious error beyond polytheism alone.

Classical Ibadi theologians have stated that only the will go to paradise, and that all sinning Ibadis as well as all non-Ibadis will be in hell forever. Ibadis traditionally reject Sunni beliefs that all Muslims in hell will eventually enter paradise, and hold that hell is eternal and inescapable for all humans who were not righteous Ibadis in life.

About the Shia, Abu Hamza al-Mukhtar said, &quot;As for these factions (of &#x27;Ali), they are a faction which has repudiated the Book of God to promulgate lies about Him. They have not left the people (of the community) because of their insight into religion (as we have), or their deep knowledge of the Qur&#x27;an; they punish crime in those who commit it, and commit it themselves when they get the chance. They have determined upon tumult and know not the way out of it. Crude in (their knowledge of) the Qur&#x27;an, following soothsayers; teaching people to hope for the resurrection of the dead, and expecting the return (of their Imams) to this world; entrusting their religion to a man who can not see them! God smite them! How perverse they are!&quot;

The notions of &quot;walayah&quot; &quot;affiliation&quot; and &quot;bara&#x27;a&quot; &quot;disassociation&quot; are central to the theology of Ibadi relations with non-Ibadi people. Only righteous Ibadis are considered worthy of friendship and association, whereas sinners and non-Ibadi Muslims are subject to dissociation, sometimes to the point of ostracism. Modern Ibadi scholars suggest that the duty of dissociation does not require rudeness or social avoidance, and that an Ibadi may have genuine affection for a non-Ibadi; nonetheless, &quot;an inner awareness of separation&quot; between upright Ibadis and non-Ibadis must be maintained. In practice, however, Ibadi Muslims have generally been very tolerant of non-Ibadi religious practice. During the period of , the duties of affiliation and disassociation are no longer valid.

Some have characterised the works of some Ibadi scholars as being particularly anti-Shi&#x27;ite in nature, and some state that Ibadi scholars, like al-Warjalani, held Nasibi views.

Ibadi beliefs remain understudied by outsiders, both non-Muslim and other Muslim. Ibadis have stated that whilst they read the works of both Sunnis and Shias, the learned scholars of those two sects never read Ibadi works and often repeat myths and false information when they address the topic of Ibadism without performing proper research.

===Theological viewpoints===
The development of Ibadi theology happened thanks to the works of scholars and imams of the community, whose histories, lives, and personalities are part of the Islamic history. Ibāḍī theology can be understood on the basis of the works of Ibn Ibāḍ, Jābir bin Zayd, Abū ‘Ubaida, Rabī‘ b. Ḥabīb and Abū Sufyān among others. Basra is the foundation of the Ibāḍī community. Various Ibāḍī communities were established in southern Arabia, with bases in Oman, North Africa, and East Africa.

In terms of scholastic theology, the Ibadi creed resembles that of the Muʿtazila in many aspects, except in the central question of predestination. Like the Muʿtazila and unlike the modern Sunni, the Ibadis believe that:

* Human knowledge of God is innate through the use of reason, rather than being learned. Therefore, a Quranic verse that appears to contradict with human reason must be metaphorically reinterpreted in the light of reason rather than being taken as fact. It is forbidden to decide matters of religious belief by &quot;taqlid&quot;, or deference to a clerical or otherwise human authority. This view is generally held among Sunni Muslims, too.
* The attributes of God are not distinct from his essence. Mercy, power, wisdom, and other divine attributes are merely different ways to describe the single unitary essence of God, rather than independent attributes and qualities that God possesses.
* Some Ibadis believe that the Quran was created by God at a certain point in time. While these Ibadis uphold the fact that &quot;essential speech&quot; is a way to describe his essence, they do not believe that the Quran is identical to this essence. To them, the Quran is simply a created indicator of his essence. This is in contrast to the Sunnis who believe that the Quran has always existed (it is uncreated). However historically earlier Ibadis believed that neither is the Qur&#x27;an created nor uncreated, and amongst contemporary Omani Ibadis some hold the Sunni position.
* Like Sunni Muslims, they interpret anthropomorphic references to God in the Quran symbolically rather than literally. Therefore, God does not actually have hands, a face, a throne, or other physical attributes, as he cannot be perceived by human senses and is not physical. They thus believe that Muslims will not see God on the Day of Resurrection, a belief shared with the Shi&#x27;a but not the Sunni. Similarly, Ibadis hold that the Scale on which God judges human deeds is metaphoric, as actions cannot be weighed.

But unlike the Mu&#x27;tazila, Ibadis follow the Ash&#x27;ari position of occasionalism, which holds that all events are caused directly by God and that what appear to be laws of causation, such as that a fire produces smoke, is only because God chooses to create fire, and then to create smoke. One Ibadi scholar has even stated that this single difference means that the Muʿtazila are more misguided than the Sunni.

===Ibadi jurisprudence===

The fiqh or jurisprudence of Ibadis is based on the same fundamental principles as Sunni and Shi&#x27;a juristic traditions, but the Ibadis reject &quot;taqlid&quot; or deference and stress the importance of &quot;ijtihad&quot;, or independent reasoning. Contemporary Ibadis hold that believers are allowed to follow incorrect opinions derived through &quot;ijtihad&quot; as long as they believe it to be true after having made an effort to arrive at the correct opinion; certain now-extinct Ibadi sects once held that those with incorrect opinions were disbelievers. Many early Ibadis rejected &quot;qiyas&quot; or deductive analogical reasoning as a basis for jurisprudence, but the importance of analogies is now widely accepted by Ibadi jurists.

Ibadis believe that the stage of the corresponds to Muhammad&#x27;s life in Mecca before the Hijrah, when no independent Muslim community existed that could enforce Islamic laws. Therefore, ḥudūd punishments are suspended under an , except the punishments for apostasy, blasphemy, and murder. Ibadis also do not hold Friday prayers in the absence of a legitimate ruling imam.

Like the Shi&#x27;a but not the Sunni, they do not allow a couple who has committed &quot;zināʾ &quot;(unlawful sex) to marry each other.

During the Ramadan fast, Ibadis require &quot;ghusl&quot; or full-body ablution to be undertaken prior to the beginning of the fast on that day if it is necessitated, otherwise the fast for that day is invalid. They hold that committing grave sins is a form of breaking the fast. When making up for missed days of fasting after Ramadan has ended, the Ibadis believe that the atonement fast must be consecutive, whereas both Sunnis and Shi&#x27;as believe that Muslims may atone for missed days by fasting for the required amount at any time, whether consecutive or nonconsecutive.

Like the Shi&#x27;a and some Maliki Sunnis, the Ibadis keep their arms at their sides rather than clasping the hands during prayer. During the noon and afternoon prayers, Ibadis recite solely al-Fātiḥah, the first chapter of the Quran, whereas other Muslims may recite other Quranic verses in addition. They also do not say &quot;ʾāmīn&quot; after the recitation of al-Fātiḥah. Ibadis shorten prayers when staying in foreign territory—even if they do so on a permanent basis—unless they choose to adopt the country as their new homeland; Sunnis generally hold that believers should return to the full prayer after a given number of days outside of home.

===Ibadi hadith===

The primary Ibadi collection of hadiths, or traditions and sayings attributed to Muhammad, is the twelfth-century &quot;Tartīb al-Musnad&quot;, comprising 1,005 hadiths. The &quot;Tartīb&quot; is divided into four books. The first two books are muttaṣil narrations by Jabir ibn Zayd, a student of Muhammad&#x27;s widow Aisha. The third book includes hadith transmitted by the eighth-century Kharijite scholar al-Rabi&#x27; bin Habib Al-Farahidi as preserved in the &quot;Jami Sahih&quot; collection, generally also from Jabir ibn Zayd. The fourth book consists of an appendix of saying and stories from later Ibadi scholars and imams.

Most of the Ibadi hadiths have a very short &quot;isnād&quot; or chain of transmission. They are claimed to be narrated from Jabir ibn Zayd to his student Abu Ubayda Muslim ibn Abi Karima and from the latter to al-Rabi&#x27;, who died in 786 after preserving his transmissions in the &quot;Jami Sahih&quot;. This was then reformulated into the &quot;Tartīb al-Musnad&quot; some four centuries later. John C. Wilkinson, an expert on Ibadism, states that this chain of transmission &quot;does not stand up to any close examination&quot;. It may be a fabrication to buttress the strength of the Ibadi school by making the Ibadis have the oldest collection of hadiths. Most Ibadi hadiths are found in the standard Sunni collections, bar a small group with Kharijite biases, and contemporary Ibadis often approve of the standard Sunni collections.

Unlike in Sunni and Shi&#x27;a Islam alike, the study of hadiths has not traditionally been very important in Ibadi Islam, especially in Oman where Sunni influence was weaker.

===Mysticism and Sufism===

Unlike traditional Sunni Islam but like the modern Salafist movement, Ibadis do not have Sufi orders and reject the veneration of saints. Historically, the views of Sufis were not well regarded in Ibadi literature, with Ibadi scholars like Al-Mundhiri writing anti-Sufi works.

However, mystical devotional practices reminiscent of Sunni Sufism were traditionally practiced by some other Ibadi scholars, to whom miracles were sometimes ascribed as with Sunni Sufis. Modern Ibadis disagree on the appropriateness of these practices within the Ibadi creed, with some considering them an undesirable non-Ibadi influence on the faith while others continue to practice and teach them.

===Views on early Islamic history===
Ibadis agree with Sunnis, regarding Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab as rightly-guided caliphs. They regard the first half of Uthman ibn Affan&#x27;s rule as righteous and the second half as corrupt and affected by both nepotism and heresy. They approve of the first part of Ali&#x27;s caliphate and (like Shī&#x27;a) disapprove of Aisha&#x27;s rebellion and Muawiyah I&#x27;s revolt. However, they regard Ali&#x27;s acceptance of arbitration at the Battle of Ṣiffīn as rendering him unfit for leadership, and condemn him for killing the Khawarij of &quot;an-Nahr&quot; in the Battle of Nahrawan. Modern Ibadi theologians defend the early Kharijite opposition to Uthman, Ali and Muawiyah.

In their belief, the next legitimate caliph and first Ibadi imam was Abdullah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi, the leader of the Kharijites who turned against Ali for his acceptance of arbitration with Muawiyah and was killed by Ali at Nahrawan. Ibadis believe that the &quot;genealogy of Islam&quot; () was transmitted by other individuals at Nahrawan, such as Ḥurḳūṣ ibn Zuhayr al-Saʿdī, and developed into Ibadi Islam, the true form of the faith.

==Wahbi school==

The Wahbi is considered to be the most mainstream of the schools of thought within Ibadism. The main reason the Wahbi strain has come to dominate within Ibadism is that most textual references that have been preserved can be attributed to Wahbi affiliated scholars.

===Texts===
The dating of early writings such as kutub al-rudud and siras (letters) written by Ibadis has led some analysts such as Salim al-Harithi to claim Ibadism as the oldest sect within Islam. However others suggest Ibadism only took on characteristics of a sect and a full-fledged madhab during the demise of the Rustamid Imamate.

===Terminology===
The term Wahbi is chiefly derived as an eponymous intimation to the teachings of Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi. Although the term Wahbi was initially considered superfluous as Ibadism was largely homogenous, its usage increased upon the advent of the Nukkari secession in order to differentiate the Wahbis from the off-shoot Ibadis. The most common epithet Wahbi Ibadi clerics enjoined their adherents to apply to themselves is the term &quot;ahl al-istiqama&quot; meaning &quot;those on the straight path&quot;. They rejected the usage of &quot;ahl al-sunnah&quot; as early usage assigned the term &quot;sunnah&quot; as the practise of Muawiyah cursing Ali ibn Abi Talib from the pulpits, although during the Umayyad era, this meaning changed.

== Demographics ==

Oman is the country with the most Ibadis; Ibadis and Sunnis make up equal numbers of Muslims (45% each), while Shia about 5%, in the population in Oman. There are roughly 2.72 million Ibadis worldwide, of which 250,000 live outside Oman.

Historically, the early medieval Rustamid dynasty in Algeria was Ibadi, and refugees from its capital, Tiaret, founded the North African Ibadi communities, which still exist in M&#x27;zab. The Mozabites, a Berber ethnic group in the M&#x27;zab valley, are Ibadis. Ibadism also exists elsewhere in Africa, particularly in Zanzibar in Tanzania, the Nafusa Mountains in Libya. They are also a minority in predominantly Sunni regions as the city of Ouargla and the island of Djerba.

The mainstream branch of Ibadism is Wahbi, although others include notable modern ones such as Nukkar and Azzabas.

<text>Reinsurance is insurance that an insurance company purchases from another insurance company to insulate itself (at least in part) from the risk of a major claims event. With reinsurance, the company passes on (&quot;cedes&quot;) some part of its own insurance liabilities to the other insurance company. The company that purchases the reinsurance policy is referred to as the &quot;ceding company&quot; or &quot;cedent&quot;. The company issuing the reinsurance policy is referred to as the &quot;reinsurer&quot;. In the classic case, reinsurance allows insurance companies to remain solvent after major claims events, such as major disasters like hurricanes or wildfires. In addition to its basic role in risk management, reinsurance is sometimes used to reduce the ceding company&#x27;s capital requirements, or for tax mitigation or other purposes.

The reinsurer may be either a specialist reinsurance company, which only undertakes reinsurance business, or another insurance company. Insurance companies that accept reinsurance refer to the business as &quot;assumed reinsurance&quot;.

There are two basic methods of reinsurance:
# Facultative Reinsurance, which is negotiated separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. Facultative reinsurance is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts in excess of the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer&#x27;s underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy, and is used for high-value or hazardous risks. 
# Treaty Reinsurance means that the ceding company and the reinsurer negotiate and execute a reinsurance contract under which the reinsurer covers the specified share of all the insurance policies issued by the ceding company which come within the scope of that contract. The reinsurance contract may obligate the reinsurer to accept reinsurance of all contracts within the scope (known as &quot;obligatory&quot; reinsurance), or it may allow the insurer to choose which risks it wants to cede, with the reinsurer obligated to accept such risks (known as &quot;facultative-obligatory&quot; or &quot;fac oblig&quot; reinsurance). These types of contracts are typically annual.

There are two main types of treaty reinsurance, &#x27;proportional and non-proportional, which are detailed below. Under &quot;proportional reinsurance,&quot; the reinsurer&#x27;s share of the risk is defined for each separate policy, while under &quot;non-proportional reinsurance&quot; the reinsurer&#x27;s liability is based on the aggregate claims incurred by the ceding office. In the past 30 years there has been a major shift from proportional to non-proportional reinsurance in the property and casualty fields.

== Functions ==
Almost all insurance companies have a reinsurance program. The ultimate goal of that program is to reduce their exposure to loss by passing part of the risk of loss to a reinsurer or a group of reinsurers.

=== Risk transfer ===
With reinsurance, the &quot;insurer&quot; can issue policies with higher limits than would otherwise be allowed, thus being able to take on more risk because some of that risk is now transferred to the re-insurer.

===Income smoothing===
Reinsurance can make an insurance company&#x27;s results more predictable by absorbing large losses. This is likely to reduce the amount of capital needed to provide coverage. The risks are spread, with the reinsurer or reinsurers bearing some of the loss incurred by the insurance company. The income smoothing arises because the losses of the cedent are limited. This fosters stability in claim payouts and caps indemnification costs.

=== Surplus relief ===
Proportional Treaties (or &quot;pro-rata&quot; treaties) provide the cedent with &quot;surplus relief&quot;; surplus relief being the capacity to write more business and/or at larger limits.

=== Arbitrage ===
The insurance company may be motivated by arbitrage in purchasing reinsurance coverage at a lower rate than they charge the insured for the underlying risk, whatever the class of insurance.

In general, the reinsurer may be able to cover the risk at a lower premium than the insurer because:

*The reinsurer may have some intrinsic cost advantage due to economies of scale or some other efficiency.
* Reinsurers may operate under weaker regulation than their clients. This enables them to use less capital to cover any risk, and to make less conservative assumptions when valuing the risk.
* Reinsurers may operate under a more favourable tax regime than their clients.
* Reinsurers will often have better access to underwriting expertise and to claims experience data, enabling them to assess the risk more accurately and reduce the need for contingency margins in pricing the risk
* Even if the regulatory standards are the same, the &quot;reinsurer&quot; may be able to hold smaller actuarial reserves than the cedent if it thinks the premiums charged by the cedent are excessively conservative.
* The reinsurer may have a more diverse portfolio of assets and especially liabilities than the cedent. This may create opportunities for hedging that the cedent could not exploit alone. Depending on the regulations imposed on the reinsurer, this may mean they can hold fewer assets to cover the risk.
* The reinsurer may have a greater risk appetite than the insurer.

=== Reinsurer&#x27;s expertise ===
The insurance company may want to avail itself of the expertise of a &quot;reinsurer&quot;, or the reinsurer&#x27;s ability to set an appropriate premium, in regard to a specific (specialised) risk. The reinsurer will also wish to apply this expertise to the underwriting in order to protect their own interests. This is especially the case in Facultative Reinsurance.

=== Creating a manageable and profitable portfolio of insured risks ===
By choosing a particular type of reinsurance method, the insurance company may be able to create a more balanced and homogeneous portfolio of insured risks. This would make its results more predictable on a net basis (i.e. allowing for the reinsurance). This is usually one of the objectives of reinsurance arrangements for the insurance companies.

== Types of reinsurance ==

===Proportional===
Under proportional reinsurance, one or more reinsurers take a stated percentage share of each policy that an insurer issues (&quot;writes&quot;). The reinsurer will then receive that stated percentage of the premiums and will pay the stated percentage of claims. In addition, the reinsurer will allow a &quot;ceding commission&quot; to the insurer to cover the costs incurred by the ceding insurer (mainly acquisition and administration, as well as the expected profit that the cedent is giving up).

The arrangement may be &quot;quota share&quot; or &quot;surplus reinsurance&quot; (also known as surplus of line or variable quota share treaty) or a combination of the two. Under a quota share arrangement, a fixed percentage (say 75%) of each insurance policy is reinsured. Under a surplus share arrangement, the ceding company decides on a &quot;retention limit&quot;: say $100,000. The ceding company retains the full amount of each risk, up to a maximum of $100,000 per policy or per risk, and the excess over this retention limit is reinsured.

The ceding company may seek a quota share arrangement for several reasons. First, it may not have sufficient capital to prudently retain all of the business that it can sell. For example, it may only be able to offer a total of $100 million in coverage, but by reinsuring 75% of it, it can sell four times as much, and retain some of the profits on the additional business via the ceding commission.

The ceding company may seek surplus reinsurance to limit the losses it might incur from a small number of large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the &quot;reinsurer&quot; (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedent would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require facultative reinsurance.

===Non-proportional===
Under non-proportional reinsurance the reinsurer only pays out if the total claim(s) suffered by the insurer exceed a stated amount, which is called the &quot;retention&quot; or &quot;priority&quot;. For instance the insurer may be prepared to accept a total loss up to $1 million, and purchases a layer of reinsurance of $4 million in excess of this $1 million. If a loss of $3 million were then to occur, the insurer would bear $1 million of the loss and would recover $2 million from its reinsurer. In this example, the insurer also retains any loss over $5 million unless it has purchased a further excess layer of reinsurance.

The main forms of non-proportional reinsurance are excess of loss and stop loss.

Excess of loss reinsurance can have three forms - &quot;Per Risk XL&quot; (Working XL), &quot;Per Occurrence or Per Event XL&quot; (Catastrophe or Cat XL), and &quot;Aggregate XL&quot;.

In per risk, the cedent&#x27;s insurance policy limits are greater than the reinsurance retention. For example, an insurance company might insure commercial property risks with policy limits up to $10 million, and then buy per risk reinsurance of $5 million in excess of $5 million. In this case a loss of $6 million on that policy will result in the recovery of $1 million from the reinsurer. These contracts usually contain event limits to prevent their misuse as a substitute for Catastrophe XLs.

In catastrophe excess of loss, the cedent&#x27;s retention is usually a multiple of the underlying policy limits, and the reinsurance contract usually contains a two risk warranty (i.e. they are designed to protect the cedent against catastrophic events that involve more than one policy, usually very many policies). For example, an insurance company issues homeowners&#x27; policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).

Aggregate XL affords a frequency protection to the reinsured. For instance if the company retains $1 million net any one vessel, $5 million annual aggregate limit in excess of $5m annual aggregate deductible, the cover would equate to 5 total losses (or more partial losses) in excess of 5 total losses (or more partial losses). Aggregate covers can also be linked to the cedent&#x27;s gross premium income during a 12-month period, with limit and deductible expressed as percentages and amounts. Such covers are then known as &quot;stop loss&quot; contracts.

===Risks attaching basis===
A basis under which reinsurance is provided for claims arising from policies commencing during the period to which the reinsurance
relates. The &quot;insurer&quot; knows there is coverage during the whole policy period even if claims are only discovered or made later on.

All claims from cedent underlying policies incepting during the period of the reinsurance contract are covered even if they occur after the expiration date of the reinsurance contract. Any claims from cedent underlying policies incepting outside the period of the reinsurance contract are not covered even if they occur during the period of the reinsurance contract.

===Losses occurring basis===
A Reinsurance treaty under which all claims occurring during the period of the contract, irrespective of when the underlying policies incepted, are covered. Any losses occurring after the contract expiration date are not covered.

As opposed to claims-made or risks attaching contracts. Insurance coverage is provided for losses occurring in the defined period. This is the usual basis of cover for short tail business.

===Claims-made basis===
A policy which covers all claims reported to an &quot;insurer&quot; within the policy period irrespective of when they occurred.

===Assumption===
Assumption reinsurance is a form of reinsurance whereby the reinsurer is substituted for the ceding insurer and becomes directly 
liable for policy claims. This ordinarily requires a notice and release from affected policyholders.

==Contracts==
Most of the above examples concern reinsurance contracts (treaty contracts) that cover more than one policy. Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as facultative reinsurance. Facultative reinsurance can be written on either a proportional or excess of loss basis. Facultative reinsurance contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. Facultative reinsurance is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by an outwards reinsurance manager, or other senior executive at the insurance company.

The reinsurer&#x27;s liability will usually cover the whole lifetime of the original insurance, once it is written. However the question arises of when either party can choose to cease the reinsurance in respect of future new business. Reinsurance treaties can either be written on a &quot;continuous&quot; or &quot;term&quot; basis. A continuous contract has no predetermined end date, but generally either party can give 90 days notice to cancel or amend the treaty for new business. A term agreement has a built-in expiration date. It is common for insurers and reinsurers to have long-term relationships that span many years. Reinsurance treaties are typically longer documents than facultative certificates, containing many of their own terms that are distinct from the terms of the direct insurance policies that they reinsure. However, even most reinsurance treaties are relatively short documents considering the number and variety of risks and lines of business that the treaties reinsure and the dollars involved in the transactions. They rely heavily on industry practice. There are not &quot;standard&quot; reinsurance contracts. However, many reinsurance contracts do include some commonly used provisions and provisions imbued with considerable industry common and practice.

==Fronting==

Sometimes insurance companies wish to offer insurance in jurisdictions where they are not licensed, or where it considers that local regulations are too onerous: for example, an insurer may wish to offer an insurance programme to a multinational company, to cover property and liability risks in many countries around the world. In such situations, the insurance company may find a local insurance company which is authorised in the relevant country, arrange for the local insurer to issue an insurance policy covering the risks in that country, and enter into a reinsurance contract with the local insurer to transfer the risks to itself. In the event of a loss, the policyholder would claim against the local insurer under the local insurance policy, the local insurer would pay the claim and would claim reimbursement under the reinsurance contract. Such an arrangement is called &quot;fronting&quot;. Fronting is also sometimes used where an insurance buyer requires its insurers to have a certain financial strength rating and the prospective insurer does not satisfy that requirement: the prospective insurer may be able to persuade another insurer, with the requisite credit rating, to provide the coverage to the insurance buyer, and to take out reinsurance in respect of the risk. An insurer which acts as a &quot;fronting insurer&quot; receives a fronting fee for this service to cover administration and the potential default of the reinsurer. The fronting insurer is taking a risk in such transactions, because it has an obligation to pay its insurance claims even if the reinsurer becomes insolvent and fails to reimburse the claims.

Many reinsurance placements are not placed with a single reinsurer but are shared between a number of reinsurers. For example, a $30,000,000 excess of $20,000,000 layer may be shared by 30 or more reinsurers. The reinsurer who sets the terms (premium and contract conditions) for the reinsurance contract is called the lead reinsurer; the other companies subscribing to the contract are called following reinsurers. Alternatively, one reinsurer can accept the whole of the reinsurance and then retrocede it (pass it on in a further reinsurance arrangement) to other companies.

Using game-theoretic modeling, Professors Michael R. Powers (Temple University) and Martin Shubik (Yale University) have argued that the number of active reinsurers in a given national market should be approximately equal to the square-root of the number of primary insurers active in the same market. Econometric analysis has provided empirical support for the Powers-Shubik rule.

Ceding companies often choose their reinsurers with great care as they are exchanging insurance risk for credit risk. Risk managers monitor reinsurers&#x27; financial ratings (S&amp;P, A.M. Best, etc.) and aggregated exposures regularly.

Because of the governance effect insurance/cedent companies can have on society, reinsurers can indirectly have societal impact as well, due to reinsurer underwriting and claims philosophies imposed on those underlying carriers which affects how the cedents offer coverage in the market. However, reinsurer governance is voluntarily accepted by cedents via contract to allow cedents the opportunity to rent reinsurer capital to expand cedent market share or limit their risk.
