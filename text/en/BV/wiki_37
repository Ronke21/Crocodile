<text>The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UT Southwestern or UTSW) is a public academic health science center in Dallas, Texas. With approximately 23,000 employees, more than 3,000 full-time faculty, and nearly 4 million outpatient visits per year, UT Southwestern is the largest medical school in the University of Texas System and the State of Texas.

UT Southwestern&#x27;s operating budget in 2021 was more than , and is the largest medical institution in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex (and therefore North Texas region), annually training about 3,800 medical, graduate, and health professions students, residents, and postdoctoral fellows. UT Southwestern Research Programs amounted to in 2022.

UT Southwestern&#x27;s faculty also provide services at Scottish Rite for Children, VA North Texas Health Care System, and other affiliated hospitals and community clinics in the North Texas region. Faculty and residents provide care in more than 80 specialties to more than 100,000 hospitalized patients, more than 360,000 emergency room cases, and oversee nearly 4 million outpatient visits a year, including more than in unreimbursed clinical services annually.

Through the major hospitals affiliated with UT Southwestern in the city of Dallas, the medical center also has a large presence throughout North Texas, including the cities of Coppell, Fort Worth, Frisco, Irving, and Plano.

UT Southwestern in Dallas has the largest medical residency program in the United States. In 2016, UT Southwestern began providing additional care through Southwestern Health Resources, a network combining the systems of Texas Health Resources and UT Southwestern. The network comprises 31 hospitals, 300 clinics, and more than 3,000 physicians and caregivers.

==History==
===Establishment and founding===
Under the leadership of Edward H. Cary and Karl Hoblitzelle, a group of Dallas citizens organized Southwestern Medical Foundation in 1939 to promote medical education and research in Dallas and the region. When Baylor University moved its school of medicine from Dallas to Houston in 1943, the foundation formally established Southwestern Medical College as the 68th medical school in the United States. Founded during World War II, the medical school was initially housed in a handful of abandoned barracks.

===Affiliation with University of Texas===
When a new state medical school was proposed after World War II, leaders of Southwestern Medical Foundation offered the college&#x27;s equipment, library, and certain restricted funds to the University of Texas System, provided the university would locate its new medical branch in Dallas. The Board of Regents accepted this offer, and in 1949 the college became Southwestern Medical School of The University of Texas. In 1954 the name was changed to The University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. The present campus site on Harry Hines Boulevard was occupied in 1955 upon the completion of the Edward H. Cary Building. This placed the medical school faculty next to the then-newly built Parkland Memorial Hospital.

In November 1972 the name and scope of the medical school were changed with its reorganization into The University of Texas Health Science Center at Dallas. This provided for coordinated but separate medical, graduate, and undergraduate components.

===Addition of Howard Hughes Medical Institute===
In 1986 the Howard Hughes Medical Institute opened a research facility on the campus. Its investigators also hold faculty positions in the basic science departments of the Medical School and Graduate School.

=== Name change and brand recognition===
In October 1987 the UT System Board of Regents approved changing the name of the health science center to The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. The Center consists of four degree-granting institutions: UT Southwestern Medical School, UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, UT Southwestern School of Health Professions, and UT Southwestern O&#x27;Donnell School of Public Health.

===Rapid physical expansion and growth===

Since the late 1960s the university has added more than 6 million square feet of new construction. The 60-acre South Campus includes 20 buildings housing classrooms, laboratories, offices, the extensive University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center Library, an auditorium, and a large outpatient center. Affiliated hospitals adjacent to the campus are Zale Lipshy Pavilion, Parkland Memorial Hospital, William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital, and Children&#x27;s Medical Center Dallas, and Children&#x27;s Medical Center Plano.

In 1987 the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation gave the university 30 acres (120,000 m2) near the South Campus for future expansion. A 20-year master plan for the site, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and John MY Lee and Partners, called North Campus, called for six research towers, a support-services building, an energy plant, and underground parking, in addition to the Mary Nell and Ralph B. Rogers Magnetic Resonance Center and the Moncrief Radiation Oncology Center.

Three research towers and an elevated campus connector, linking the South Campus with the North Campus, were completed in the 1990s. A fourth 14-story research tower was completed in 2005, followed by a 12-story research tower in 2011. In 1999 the university purchased an additional 50 acres from the MacArthur Foundation, and a portion was used to create an on-campus student-housing complex of 156 apartments. A second phase of 126 units opened in 2004. In 2008, the university purchased the 24-acre Exchange Park adjacent to the North Campus.

In 2008, UT Southwestern announced plans to open the BioCenter at Southwestern Medical District, a facility to commercialize university technologies and attract biotech companies to the area.

Also in 2008, UT Southwestern acquired the Exchange Park site and renamed it the Paul M. Bass Administrative and Clinical Center on the North Campus. The center was named in honor of Mr. Bass, chairman emeritus of the Southwestern Medical Foundation, who served in that role until 2008. With this property, the campus grew to 9 million square feet of laboratory, clinical, educational, and administrative space, covering 387 acres.

In 2009, the $186 million Biomedical Research Building (NL Building on the North Campus) opened. The building is the largest LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) silver-certified laboratory space in Texas. UT Southwestern opened its William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital on Dec. 6, 2014, along with the decommissioning of the 50-year-old St. Paul University Hospital. UTSW opened its Radiation Oncology center in 2017. In March 2022, a $100 million gift, made by the O’Donnell Foundation, endowed a new school of public health. It is the largest gift to any school of public health at a public university in the U.S.

In 2023, UT Southwestern announced a multi-billion dollar plan for a new pediatric campus for Children&#x27;s Medical Center Dallas to be built in 2031 adjacent to the main university hospital.

In 2022, UTSW kicked off construction of a 296 psychiatric hospital south of the current Children&#x27;s medical campus.

==Academics==
UT Southwestern is governed by the UT System Board of Regents. The Medical Center includes four degree-granting institutions/schools: UT Southwestern Medical School, UT Southwestern Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, UT Southwestern School of Health Professions, and UT Southwestern Peter O&#x27;Donnell Jr. School of Public Health. Throughout its history, UT Southwestern has graduated approximately 22,420 physicians and other professionals in all areas of medicine. In 2022 alone, UTSW faculty is training about 3,800 medical, graduate, and health professions students, residents, and postdoctoral fellows.

===UT Southwestern Medical School===
UT Southwestern admits approximately 230 students each year. The average MCAT score is 518, and undergraduate GPA in 2023 was 3.93. The acceptance rate for 2014 was 5.6%.

UTSW is one of the five least-expensive public medical schools and among the top 10 largest medical schools in the United States. The school&#x27;s tuition and fees are approximately $23,200 per year for in-state residents, being subsidized by the state of Texas. Admission is competitive and, by mandate of the state legislature, 90% of applicants admitted are from the state of Texas. Many out-of-state students earn competitive scholarships that make up the difference.

The Medical School&#x27;s curriculum emphasizes clinical experience and electives from the first year on. The curriculum comprises three periods:

*Pre-Clerkship
*Clerkship
*Post-Clerkship

The UTSW curriculum focuses on providing a foundation in biomedical sciences, training in clinical care, and opportunities for research. The Medical School features six Academic Colleges that function as small learning communities, each headed by a faculty mentor.

Along with the M.D. degree, UT Southwestern offers options for students to pursue combined degrees and to earn special graduation distinctions. The combined degrees include:

* M.D./Ph.D. (Called the Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP), this is one of fewer than 50 M.D./Ph.D. granting programs nationwide that receive financial support from the National Institutes of Health. It combines dissertation work in an area of biomedical science, leading to the Ph.D., along with clinical studies, leading to the M.D.)
* M.D./M.B.A. (This five-year program in conjunction with UT Dallas focuses on giving future physicians the skills for integrating medicine and business)
* M.D./M.P.H. (UT Southwestern and UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston offer students a university degree in each field at the end of their four-year M.D. program)
* M.D./M.S. (In Clinical Science. This program combines didactic training with a mentored clinical research project. The program concludes with submission and defense of a master&#x27;s thesis)

===Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences===

With an enrollment of more than 1,000 students (549 predoctoral and 484 postdoctoral), the Graduate School educates biomedical scientists, engineers, clinical researchers, and counselors. Programs lead to Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) and Master of Science (M.S.) degrees and, in some cases, non-degree certificates.

The Graduate School has 12 Ph.D. programs: Biological Chemistry; Biomedical Engineering; Cancer Biology; Cell and Molecular Biology; Clinical Psychology; Genetics, Development, and Disease; Immunology; Integrative Biology; Molecular Biophysics; Molecular Microbiology; Neuroscience; and Organic Chemistry.

In addition, a Master&#x27;s Degree and a certificate are offered in Clinical Science. Postdoctoral certificates are offered in Research, Advanced Research, Cancer, Educational Techniques, Obesity and Metabolism, and Scientific Management.

UT Southwestern runs a Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP) offering a combined M.D./Ph.D. degree. It is one of only 54 M.D./Ph.D. granting programs nationwide that receive financial support from the National Institutes of Health. The largest source of private support for UTSW&#x27;s program has been from H. Ross Perot.[10]

The clinical training curriculum includes coursework in the disciplines necessary to understand human disease at the level of cellular physiology and biochemistry. In addition, students practice clinical skills at UT Southwestern&#x27;s affiliated clinical training hospitals, including Parkland Memorial Hospital and William P. Clements Jr. University Hospital.

Following summer laboratory rotations, students choose one of 10 interdepartmental graduate programs and select a dissertation mentor from the UT Southwestern Graduate School faculty for training in intellectual and experimental strategies. During these years, the MSTP student functions as a graduate student in his or her laboratory while maintaining an awareness of clinical medicine through program activities.

Dissertation research culminates in results that significantly advance the state of biomedical knowledge.

===School of Health Professions===

About 340 students are enrolled in UT Southwestern&#x27;s School of Health Professions. The school confers a doctoral professional degree in Physical Therapy and master&#x27;s degrees in Clinical Nutrition, Physician Assistant Studies, Prosthetics-Orthotics, and Rehabilitation Counseling. The school also has a baccalaureate certificate program in Radiation Therapy.

The Physician Assistant program was founded in 1972. For the past five years, graduates have had a 100% first-time pass rate on the national certifying exam. Much of the training occurs at Parkland Hospital.[11]

===Peter O&#x27;Donnell Jr. School of Public Health===

The Peter O&#x27;Donnell Jr. School of Public Health is UT Southwestern&#x27;s newest school. The school was established in 2022.

===Academic Rankings===
==Leadership programs==

UT Southwestern Medical Center is one of seven health systems in the United States being recognized for its leadership development initiatives to internal employees.

==Library==
The Health Sciences Digital Library and Learning Center supports the information needs of UT Southwestern&#x27;s research, educational, and clinical activities. The Library and Learning Center maintains a large collection of electronic information resources, print archives, rare books, and materials concerning the history of medicine. It also offers assistance and training in using these resources. The library also has a small branch on the North Campus.[12]

== Research ==
UT Southwestern had a total research expenditure of $634.9 million in 2022. UT Southwestern scientists and physician researchers conduct investigations into cancer, stem cells, neuroscience, heart disease and stroke, arthritis, diabetes, and many other fields.

At the Peter O’Donnell Jr. Brain Institute on campus, investigators research the basic molecular workings of the brain, and their application to the prevention and treatment of brain diseases and injuries. The Institute covers neurodegenerative diseases; depression and psychiatric disorders; migraines; and spine, nerve, and muscle diseases. Also at the Institute are voice specialists, rehabilitation experts, and neuroimmunologists, plus basic and translational scientists in cellular and molecular neuroscience, neurobiology, regenerative medicine, neuro-engineering, imaging, and genetics.

Researchers at UTSW&#x27;s Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center, the only cancer center in North Texas with the National Cancer Institute&#x27;s &quot;comprehensive&quot; designation, are focusing on discovering drug-like chemicals that drive or inhibit cancer growth, and deciphering mechanisms in cell regulatory networks that go awry and contribute to cancer initiation and growth. Researchers in developmental biology, cancer biology, and stem cell biology work on how developmental processes contribute to cancer&#x27;s progress.

In 2011, the Children&#x27;s Medical Center Research Institute at UT Southwestern (CRI) was established as a joint venture between Children&#x27;s Health System of Texas and UTSW. Located on the UTSW campus, CRI is home to an interdisciplinary group of scientists and physicians pursuing research in regenerative medicine, cancer biology and metabolism.

UT Southwestern established the Hamon Center for Regenerative Science and Medicine in 2014 for research on fundamental mechanisms of tissue formation and repair, and to develop transformative strategies and medications for tissue regeneration.

Research at UTSW&#x27;s Texas Institute for Brain Injury and Repair focuses on brain injuries and conditions, including traumatic brain injury (TBI), stroke, and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The institute also promotes brain injury education and prevention.

Other research currently underway at UT Southwestern includes studies on:
* Aging and Alzheimer&#x27;s (Steven McKnight and colleagues identified a compound (P7C3) and demonstrated that it preserves newly created brain cells and boosts learning and memory. The study has led to further investigations into the mechanism by which P7C3 protects cells from dying and whether the compound might have any protective effect for various neurodegenerative diseases).
* Cancer/Biomarkers (John Minna and Adi Gazdar have spent the past 30 years elucidating the genetic changes associated with the development of lung cancer. Their work seeks to discover these changes and use them as biomarkers both to detect lung cancer earlier and to develop new therapies. Their approach is advancing personalized medicine, which aims to target the unique characteristics of an individual&#x27;s tumor with the best current therapies).
* Cancer/Stem Cells (A team led by Sean J. Morrison at CRI has identified the environment in which blood-forming stem cells survive and thrive within the body, an important step toward increasing the safety and effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation).
* Cardiology/Regeneration (Researchers, including Eric Olson and Hesham Sadek, have pinpointed a molecular mechanism needed to unleash the heart&#x27;s ability to regenerate. They found that microRNAs, tiny strands that regulate gene expression, contribute to the heart&#x27;s ability to regenerate up to one week after birth. Soon thereafter the heart loses the ability to regenerate. Identifying the heart&#x27;s natural regenerative on-off switch is a critical step toward developing eventual therapies for damage suffered following a heart attack. Olson&#x27;s lab has also used CRISPR/Cas9 methods to cure Duchenne muscular dystrophy in mice as a proof of principle for human gene therapy).
* Cholesterol (UT Southwestern researchers have identified nearly 30 disease-causing genes, including in 1983 the gene responsible for familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition that causes extremely high levels of cholesterol and heart attacks at an early age. That discovery by Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein contributed to the pair winning the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research uncovering the underlying mechanisms of cholesterol metabolism).
* Diabetes/Obesity (Philipp Scherer&#x27;s discovery of adiponectin, a hormone produced by fat, has helped transform the scientific concept of fat as an inert storage depot to that of an endocrine “organ” that exerts control over multiple organs. His studies have revealed adiponectin&#x27;s potent anti-diabetes effects of blocking glucose production in the liver and improving insulin sensitivity in muscle. Because adiponectin levels fall as fat levels rise, drugs that increase adiponectin may be effective in fighting diabetes and other obesity-related diseases).
* Human Genetics (Helen Hobbs and Jonathan Cohen are among the world&#x27;s leading experts on the genetic factors associated with lipid disorders. Their work, for which Hobbs received the 2016 Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences, has led to the development of a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, PCSK9 antibodies, for patients who do not tolerate or respond adequately to statins).
* Innate Immunity (Scientists led by Zhijian “James” Chen are exploring the mechanisms of signal transduction, namely how a cell communicates with its surroundings and within itself. They are focused on investigating how a cell detects harmful or foreign threats and mounts an appropriate response to restore homeostasis. Chen was elected to the National Academy of Sciences, for work including the cytoplasmic DNA sensor cGAS and its product cGAMP, a novel cyclic dinucleotide second messenger involved in innate immune response. Bruce Beutler received the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian lipopolysaccharide receptor complex that senses microbial infection and triggers septic shock. Beutler continues to identify components of the mammalian immune system through large-scale mouse mutagenesis screens conducted in the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense, which he leads).

<text>Vuk Drašković (, ; born 29 November 1946) is a Serbian writer and politician. He is the co-founder and former leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, serving as president from 1990 to 2024. He also served as the war-time Deputy Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in 1999 during the rule of Slobodan Milošević and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of both Serbia and Montenegro and Serbia from 2004 to 2007.

He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Law in 1968. From 1969 to 1980, he worked as a journalist in the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug. He was a member of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and worked as the chief of staff of the Yugoslav President Mika Špiljak.

==Early life and career==
Drašković was born in the small village of Medja in the Banat region to a family of settlers from Herzegovina. He was three months old when his mother, Stoja Nikitović, died.

His father, Vidak, remarried and had two more sons - Rodoljub and Dragan; and three daughters - Radmila, Tanja and Ljiljana with Dara Drašković, meaning that young Vuk grew up with five half-siblings.

Shortly after Vuk&#x27;s birth, the entire family went back to Herzegovina where he finished primary school in the village of Slivlje. He graduated high school in Gacko.

At his father&#x27;s insistence, Drašković considered studying medicine in Sarajevo; however, the city was too &quot;uptight and cramped&quot; for his liking, so he went to study law in Belgrade instead.
In 1968, Drašković participated in anti-bureaucratic student revolts in Yugoslavia. After Josip Broz Tito promised reforms, Drašković initiated people to dance the Kozaračko kolo at the Faculty of Law. Drašković was a member of the Communist Youth Organization and later joined the League of Communists of Yugoslavia.

Between 1969–78, he was involved with journalism. He first worked for the state news agency Tanjug as its African correspondent stationed in Lusaka, Zambia. He was discharged from his post after publishing misleading information regarding the Rhodesian Bush War, creating a diplomatic incident.

He then took a job as press adviser to the Yugoslav Union of Trade Unions (&quot;Savez Sindikata Jugoslavije&quot;) and then became editor-in-chief of &quot;Rad&quot;, a trade union paper. During his time as press adviser, Drašković spent some time as the personal secretary to the organisation&#x27;s president Mika Špiljak.

In 1981, Drašković published his first novel &quot;Sudije&quot; (Judges) which described a judge resisting political pressure.

In 1982, Drašković was expelled from the Communist party after he published his second novel &quot;Nož&quot; (Knife). The novel tells the story of a man who is raised as a Bosnian Muslim who comes to believe that Serbs killed his family, only to later learn that his ethnic heritage is Serbian and that his adoptive family was guilty of murdering his birth-family. The book caused controversy as it reignited divisive ethno-nationalist issues which Tito and the Communist Party tried to suppress. The party condemned and subsequently banned the book, which was also published in English. The book was made into a movie in 1999 entitled &quot;The Dagger&quot; or &quot;The Knife&quot; in English.

His novels &quot;Molitva 1–2&quot; (Prayer 1–2, 1985) and &quot;Ruski konsul&quot; (Russian consul, 1988) also explored the suffering of Serbs during World War II, while &quot;Noć generala&quot; (The General&#x27;s Nights) published in 1994 dealt with Draža Mihailović&#x27;s last days.

==Political career==
In March 1989, Drašković along with Mirko Jović and Vojislav Šešelj founded the Sava Association. The group dedicated itself to the protection of the Serbian language and the defense of Kosovo and Metohija. In the late 1980s, Drašković was in agreement with Šešelj&#x27;s sentiments about deporting Albanians from Kosovo and suggested that &quot;a special fund&quot; was needed &quot;to finance the repopulation of Kosovo by Serbs&quot;. However, Jović, Šešelj and Drašković disagreed with each other and their party split into three. The Sava Association became the Serbian National Renewal Party under the leadership of Jović in January 1990. Drašković founded the Serbian Renewal Movement (&quot;Srpski Pokret Obnove&quot;, SPO, a democratic nationalist party) in March, and then in February 1991 Šešelj created his Serbian Radical Party.

On 26 September 1990, Drašković declared that his armed &quot;volunteers&quot; would be willing to defend Krajina Serbs, and three days later in an interview with Delo, Drašković stated: &quot;Serbia must obtain all territories in what is today Herzegovina, Bosnia, Slavonia, Dalmatia, in these parts of Croatia where the Serbs made a majority of the population until 6 April 1941, when the Ustasha genocide against them began...Wherever the Serb blood was shed by the Ustashas knives, wherever there are our graves there are our borders&quot;. He also claimed that most Bosnian Muslims are &quot;burdened with Serbian origin&quot; and that &quot;they run away from themselves because they know that they are Orthodox and Serbs&quot;. The Serbian Renewal Movement (SPO) participated in the first post-communist democratic elections, held on 9 December 1990, but finished a distant second amidst the total blackout from the pro-Milošević state media. Following that failure Drašković kept pressure on Serbian President Slobodan Milošević via street protests, organizing mass demonstrations in Belgrade on 9 March 1991. The police intervened, and clashed with demonstrators with some damage to public buildings resulting in the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army being brought in. Clashes between police and protesters resulted in the deaths of a student and an officer, and injuries to over 200 people. Demonstrations ended after the government agreed to concessions.

Drašković became a leading opponent of Milošević. His fiery and emotional speeches earned him the moniker &quot;Czar of the Streets&quot;.

While Drašković was a nationalist, he also held pro-Western and anti-war views. His plan was to rapidly transform the biggest and most populous part of Yugoslavia (i.e. Serbia) according to Western standards so that eventual international involvement in the Yugoslav crisis would favour Serbian interests and produce a peaceful solution. His ideological opponents often cite his strong nationalist feelings (including attempting rehabilitation of Serb-nationalist Chetniks) as contradictory to his insistence on peaceful solutions. Political opponents have claimed Drašković&#x27;s political engagement at this early stage of his political career was full of inconsistencies and diametrically opposing views and actions. According to Drašković, his stance as pro-Western and peaceful never wavered, from the start of the political crisis in Yugoslavia. He insisted that a Serbian government should promote radical democratic shift, and renew traditional alliances with Western nations (including entry into NATO) as a way of preserving some form of Yugoslav confederation rather than pursuing direct confrontation with the Croats.

His party SPO organized a paramilitary unit called the Serbian Guard, led by former criminals such as Đorđe &quot;Giška&quot; Božović and Branislav &quot;Beli&quot; Matić. Božović died in Croatia in October 1991. Matić was killed by Milošević&#x27;s secret police in April 1991. Although Drašković initially claimed that this militia was an incitement to Serbian authorities to form a non-ideological national armed force other than the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army, he eventually distanced himself from the paramilitary formation altogether.

According to historian Dubravka Stojanović, while Drašković&#x27;s anti-war views were sincere, he also supported a nationalist program little different in its goals to those of Milošević, and he and his party were never able to reconcile these opposing currents.

His anti-war views came to the fore in mid to late 1991, particularly in November of that year when he wrote a passionate condemnation of the bloody siege of Vukovar in the Serbian daily &quot;Borba&quot;.

In early 1992, he called on all citizens of Bosnia to reject nationalism. In 1993, he and his wife Danica Drašković were arrested, beaten and sent to a high-security prison following street riots in Belgrade. His hunger strike, and international outrage over the situation, pressured the government to release the couple.

In 1996, SPO formed an opposition alliance &quot;Zajedno&quot; (&quot;Together&quot;) with the Democratic Party of Zoran Đinđić and the Civic Alliance of Serbia under Vesna Pešić, which achieved major successes in the local elections in November of that year, but later split.

Drašković&#x27;s SPO participated on its own at the September 1997 election, boycotted by his former partners despite an array of local electronic media outlets being in opposition hands.

In January 1999, SPO, a parliamentary party, was asked to join a coalition with Milošević&#x27;s Socialist Party of Serbia as tension with US and NATO increased, in order to use his influence with Western politicians. In early 1999, Drašković became the deputy prime minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He did so in response to Milošević&#x27;s appeal for national unity in the face of Albanian uprising in Kosovo and a looming confrontation with NATO. He was sacked by the Prime Minister Momir Bulatović on 28 April 1999.

There were two attempts to assassinate Drašković: on 3 October 1999 on the Ibar highway when four of his close associates were murdered, and on 15 June 2000 in Budva.

In 2005, Milorad Ulemek was sentenced to 40 years in prison for the murder of Đinđić and Ivan Stambolić and for the assassination attempt on Drašković in 2000.

===Post-Milošević===

In what he himself later termed &quot;a bad political move&quot;, Drašković kept his SPO out of the wide anti-Milošević Democratic Opposition of Serbia (DOS) coalition that formed in 2000; his candidate in the 24 September 2000 federal presidential elections, Vojislav Mihailović, achieved little success, and the SPO was unsuccessful in the subsequent parliamentary election which the DOS won overwhelmingly. Because of this, Drašković and his party were marginalized over the next three years.

In the fall of 2002, he attempted a comeback as one of eleven candidates in a Serbian presidential election; this election was later declared invalid due to low voter turnout. Despite a polished marketing campaign that saw Drašković change his personal appearance and tone down his fiery rhetoric, he ended up with only 4.5% of the total vote, well behind Vojislav Koštunica (31.2%) and Miroljub Labus (27.7%), both of whom moved on to the second-round runoff.

His next chance for political redemption came in late 2003. Fully aware of SPO&#x27;s weak political standing (as well as his own) after more than 3 years in political oblivion, Drašković entered his party into a pre-election coalition with New Serbia (NS), thus reuniting with old party colleague Velimir Ilić. Joining forces for the 2003 parliamentary election, they achieved limited success, but did manage to get into the coalition that formed the minority government (along with DSS, G17 Plus), providing it with critical parliamentary seats to keep the far-right radicals (SRS) at bay.

In the subsequent division of power, Drašković became foreign minister, a position he held until May 2007. In response to Montenegro&#x27;s vote for independence, Drašković called for a restoration of Serbia&#x27;s monarchy: &quot;This is an historic moment for Serbia itself, a beginning which would be based on the historically-proven and victorious pillars of the Serbian state and I am talking about the pillars of a kingdom.&quot;

In August 2010, Drašković argued in favour of changing the Serbian Constitution of 2006 to remove references to Kosovo as a part of Serbia because according to him &quot;Serbia has no national sovereignty over Kosovo whatsoever. All of Serbia knows that Kosovo is not really a province within Serbia, that it is completely beyond the control of the government and the state of Serbia&quot;.

==Personal life==
Drašković is married to Danica (née Bošković). The two met in 1968 during student protests.

<text>Stephen Dao Hui Hsu (born 1966) is an American physicist, startup founder, and former university administrator.

== Early life and education ==
Hsu was born and raised in Ames, Iowa. His father Cheng Ting Hsu (1923–1996), who was born in Wenling, Zhejiang, in what was then the Republic of China, was a professor of aerospace engineering at Iowa State University in Ames from 1958 to 1989. Stephen Hsu&#x27;s mother was also originally from China, and Hsu had a grandfather who served as a general in the National Revolutionary Army of the Chinese Kuomintang government. At age 12, Hsu took physics and mathematics courses at Iowa State while attending Ames High School.

Hsu received a B.S. from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1986 at age 19, and a Ph.D. from the University of California, Berkeley in 1991. After his doctorate, he was a Harvard Junior Fellow and Superconducting Super Collider Fellow from 1991 to 1994.
== Career ==
In 1995, he became an assistant professor at Yale University before moving to the University of Oregon in 1998, where he became a full professor of theoretical physics and director of the Institute of Theoretical Science. Hsu&#x27;s research has focused on a number of areas in particle physics and cosmology, including phase transitions in the early universe, the ground state of quark matter at high density, black holes and quantum information, minimum length from quantum gravity, dark energy, and quantum foundations.

In July 2012, Michigan State University named him vice president for research and graduate studies. At the time, &quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; and &quot;Lansing State Journal&quot; described the appointment as controversial, due to Hsu&#x27;s comments endorsing research into using genetic modification to increase human intelligence, and his blog posts describing human race categorization as biologically valid.

On June 10, 2020, the MSU graduate student union began calling for Hsu to be removed from the administrative position. The MSU student association also called for his removal, and multiple petitions were circulated, including a counter-petition. As of June 17, petitions for removal had 700 and 470 signatures, while the counter petition had over 970 signatures. On June 19, 2020 MSU president Samuel L. Stanley announced that Hsu had resigned as vice president, returning to a tenured faculty position. Hsu said that Stanley had requested his resignation, and that he did not agree with Stanley&#x27;s decision.

In 2000, Hsu went on leave from the University of Oregon to create Safeweb, an anonymizer service. In 2003, SafeWeb was acquired by Symantec for its SSL VPN technology.

Hsu is a founder of Genomic Prediction, a company that develops genetic testing for IVF embryos. Hsu has an interest in psychometrics and human genetic variation, which he writes about in his blog and in other publications.

In 2017, Hsu and five collaborators published a paper in &quot;Genetics&quot; on the use of lasso to construct genomic predictors of complex human traits (height, bone density, cognitive ability), using data from the UK Biobank. Their genotype height predictor estimated adult height within an accuracy of roughly one inch.

In 2018 his research group used the method on the same dataset to build genomic predictors for complex diseases such as hypothyroidism, (resistive) hypertension, type 1 and 2 diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, gallstones, glaucoma, gout, atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, asthma, basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, and heart attack. Outliers in risk score (e.g., 99th percentile) were shown, in out-of-sample validation tests, to have up to ten times the risk of ordinary individuals for the specific conditions. The predictors use as input information dozens to thousands of common SNPs measured for each individual.

He serves as scientific adviser to BGI (formerly Beijing Genomics Institute), and as a member of its Cognitive Genomics Lab.

<text>The Football League Super Cup (known for sponsorship reasons as the ScreenSport Super Cup) was a one-off football club competition held in England in the 1985–86 season. It was organised by the Football League and was intended as a form of financial and sporting compensation for the English clubs which had qualified for European competition in the previous season but had been banned from entering European tournaments by UEFA following the Heysel Stadium disaster. With the ban set to last into the foreseeable future, England&#x27;s clubs stood to lose a great deal of revenue, and would also have fewer opportunities to win silverware, so the Super Cup was established in order to hopefully offset at least some of this lost income, as well as offering additional competition for them.

The Football League&#x27;s original intention was to hold the Super Cup annually for the duration of the UEFA ban on English clubs (which ultimately turned out to be five years) but the competition was largely seen as a poor substitute for the glamour of European tournaments and offered nothing different from the two domestic knockout competitions that already existed, the FA Cup and League Cup. Consequently, it generated minimal interest from the clubs involved. With the competition&#x27;s final postponed until the beginning of the following season due to fixture congestion, the Super Cup was ultimately abolished after only one tournament had been held.

Interest in the competition was so low that the Football League initially failed to attract any form of sponsorship for it. Cable TV sports channel Screensport agreed to sponsor the tournament&#x27;s final in September 1986.

==Format==
The six clubs invited to participate, and the European competitions they would have qualified for, were:
* Everton (Football League champions, European Cup)
* Manchester United (FA Cup winners, European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup)
* Norwich City (League Cup winners, UEFA Cup)
* Liverpool (UEFA Cup)
* Tottenham Hotspur (UEFA Cup)
* Southampton (UEFA Cup)

To create a sufficient number of games, the teams played each other home and away in two groups of three teams, with three points awarded for a win and one point for a draw, with the top two teams in each group advancing to the semi-finals. Both the semi-finals and the final were held over two legs, home and away, which was perhaps another factor which may have contributed to the competition&#x27;s failure to attract much interest from the clubs participating, as the tournament did not offer the prospect of a day out at Wembley for the finalists.

==Competition history==
Merseyside rivals Liverpool and Everton won through to the final, but with both these clubs being involved in a battle for the league championship and both of them also reaching the FA Cup final (as well as Liverpool being involved in the semi-finals of the Football League Cup), fixture congestion became a problem, with Liverpool&#x27;s semi-final second leg having to be delayed until the final week of the season, two days before the FA Cup final. The English football season had to come to an end immediately following the FA Cup final due to the preparations for the imminent FIFA World Cup in Mexico (which many Everton and Liverpool players were to be involved in), which meant that there was no opportunity for the delayed Super Cup final to be played after the FA Cup final and that the Super Cup tournament could not be concluded before the 1985–86 season ended.

The absence of any conclusion of the Super Cup before the season&#x27;s end may have put paid to any possibility of a second Super Cup tournament being organised in the 1986–87 season, although the perceived failure of the inaugural competition and its unpopularity with the clubs made such an eventuality unlikely in any case. (If the 1986–87 Super Cup had been staged, it would have been contested by Liverpool, Everton, West Ham United, Manchester United, Sheffield Wednesday and Oxford United).

Ultimately the 1985–86 Super Cup final had to be held over until the following season and was finally played in September 1986, by which point the competition had finally attracted some sponsorship. Everton, however, fielded a virtual reserve team in the two-legged final (although they were in the middle of a genuine injury crisis) and Liverpool won the trophy 7–2 on aggregate. The games are remembered for Ian Rush&#x27;s impressive haul of five goals for Liverpool over the two games (although these goals are sometimes excluded from his official record-breaking Merseyside derby tally) and for Kevin Sheedy&#x27;s spectacular goal for Everton at Anfield, scored from a long-range free-kick at the Kop end. Having lost the League and Cup double to Liverpool the previous May, Everton later that season managed to pip Liverpool to the League Championship.

The Super Cup was not a success as it was unable to substitute for games against the best sides in Europe in prestigious UEFA competitions. Attendances were generally poor and the clubs involved apparently regarded the tournament as a pointless addition to the existing three national tournaments and a source of fixture congestion. Consequently, the Super Cup was abolished after only one season and it has not been held since. The competition is now largely forgotten.

==Similar competitions==
The Full Members&#x27; Cup, another Football League cup competition also launched in 1985 for similar reasons (to create additional competition, revenue and opportunity for silverware for English clubs, as well as a final at Wembley Stadium), fared marginally better and ran until 1992, often better remembered as the &quot;ZDS Cup&quot; due to that competition being sponsored by Zenith Data Systems. 
A similar competition to the Super Cup, the Mercantile Credit Centenary Trophy was played in the early weeks of 1988–89 to celebrate the league&#x27;s 100th birthday between the top eight Football League teams from the previous season. The competition, played over three rounds on a knock-out basis, was won by Arsenal.

<doc id="617928" wikidata="Q4807977" url="?curid=617928" title="Asphodel–Norwood">
<text>Asphodel–Norwood is a lower tier township municipality in Peterborough County in Central Ontario, Canada, with a 2021 population of 4,658. The land on which the township is situated is the traditional territory of the Mississauga, and became open to European colonization following its survey in 1820. The site that would become Norwood was settled in 1823, and it was incorporated as a village in 1878. The township, in its current form, was created in 1998 by the reunification of the village of Norwood with the surrounding township of Asphodel.

The terrain of the township is mostly short hills, with the southern boundary mostly defined by the Trent River. The symbol of the township is the trillium, which grows abundantly in the region. The presence of trillium also inspired early surveyor Richard Birdsall to name the region after a similar-looking wildflower native to England, the asphodel.

Hockey has formed a core part of township life, with minor league teams being formed as early as the 1920s. The annual Norwood Fair draws many visitors to the area.

==History==

The land in which Asphodel–Norwood is situated has been inhabited for millennia by the First Nations. By the time of the arrival of the first French explorers to the region, the land that is now the township, along with the rest of Central Ontario, was contested between the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat. This conflict ended with the destruction of a large Wendat village in 1649, which resulted in the departure of the remaining Wendat from what was to become Ontario. The Mississauga Nation migrated into the area in the following decades, and it was the Mississaugas that the British recognized as owners of the land that was to become Peterborough County. The British government, having recognized First Nation ownership of the land in the Royal Proclamation of 1763, began to treat with the Mississaugas to acquire these lands to open them to settlement. On 5 November 1818, Treaty No. 20 was signed in Hope Township, known as the Rice Lake Treaty, which in exchange for an annual annuity the Mississaugas surrendered nearly 2 million acres of land north of Rice Lake.

Zacheus Burnham had secured the contract from the colonial government to begin surveying the surrendered land. Burnham, in turn, hired Richard Birdsall to complete those surveys in his stead. In 1820 Birdsall completed the survey of the township. The abundance of trilliums Birdsall encountered while conducting the survey reminded him of the asphodels of his native England, and it is for these that the township was named. Birdsall was also one of the first Europeans to settle in Asphodel, establishing a homestead at lot 1, concession 1.

In 1841 the first semblance of municipal government in what was by now Canada West was created by the District Councils Act, which placed the administrative functions of the Districts of the Province of Canada with an elected council serving under a provincially-appointed Warden. That same year Asphodel became a part of the new Colborne District, and the first representative for Asphodel on the new District Council was Richard Birdsall. Local municipal government began with the passage of the Municipal Act of 1849, which first established local political positions and transformed townships from mere units of settlement into units of governance. Richard Birdsall then became the first Reeve, and represented Asphodel on the council of the new Peterborough County for two years until his death.

=== Norwood ===

In 1823, Joseph Keeler, a Major in the colonial militia during the War of 1812, was granted 500 acres of land in Asphodel along the Ouse River as a reward for his services. It was this site that would eventually become Norwood, though during the early decades it was known as Keeler&#x27;s Mill. In subsequent years Keeler expanded his property through purchasing neighbouring lots until it grew to a size of 2000 acres by 1836. That year, the mill complex was upgraded and expanded with additional machinery, and Keeler had part of his property divided into village lots. Keeler also changed the name of his settlement to Norwood, reflecting the colloquial appellation &quot;North woods&quot;. This new village quickly grew, with the first church built that year, and the first store the year after. The first school in Asphodel existed at Keeler&#x27;s Mill by 1832, four years prior to Keeler&#x27;s division of his property.

Norwood would steadily grow in prominence, and when the Municipal Act took effect in 1850, Norwood came to house the municipal government of Asphodel. It also came to hold some county offices, such as the Division Court which heard cases from the south-eastern corner of Peterborough County. In 1868 the farmers of the township, having organized themselves into the Norwood Agricultural Society, held the first exhibition in Norwood, which continues to be held annually and is now known as the Norwood Fair. On 1 January 1878 Norwood became incorporated as a village. This made Norwood independent of the township, and so the municipal government of the township moved to Westwood, though a dedicated administrative building there would not be built until 1883.

Historically, there was another community named Norwood, 100 km to the west, which was renamed to Greenwood in 1852.

=== Westwood ===

Despite being the closest site to the original colonial presence in the township, Westwood was the slowest of the Asphodel settlements to develop, with the first mill only being built there in 1832 by Thomas Walker. A second mill was constructed nearby in 1845, which helped the fledgling hamlet grow. By 1858 about 100 people called Westwood home. Walker operated the first post office in the township at his farmstead near his mill. As mentioned, when Norwood separated from the township in 1878, the municipal government for Asphodel was relocated to Westwood, with a municipal building being erected in 1883. Westwood remained the seat of the municipality until amalgamation in 1998.

=== Hastings ===

In 1810 James Crooks, a land speculator residing in Niagara, acquired a large stretch of property alongside the rapids in the Trent River in what was then Percy Township. By 1828 he had expanded this property across the river into Asphodel, and upon this land he built a mill. By 1835 Crooks divided his property, by this time known as Crooks Rapids, in village lots. The colonial government was keen on the creation of a canal system between the Bay of Quinte and Lake Simcoe, which today is known as the Trent-Severn Waterway, and from 1837 through to 1839 a dam and a lock system were constructed to allow watercraft to bypass the rapids. This construction, combined with the creation of a bridge over the river and the site being a point of convergence for Northumberland County&#x27;s road network, made Crooks Rapids into a transportation hub for the area and the settlement grew rapidly. On 1 April 1874 the settlement, which was bifurcated physically by the Trent and politically by the county line separating Peterborough and Northumberland, was incorporated as the Village of Hastings. The village chose to be tied to Northumberland County, and the north half of the village thus seceded from Peterborough County.

=== Amalgamation ===

In 1995 Ontario elected a Conservative government under Premier Mike Harris, who initiated a wave of municipal mergers known as amalgamations, which reduced the number of municipalities in the province by nearly half, from 850 to 444. As part of this amalgamation wave, on 1 January 1998 the Village of Norwood and the Township of Asphodel were merged to form the Township of Asphodel–Norwood, 120 years to the day from Norwood&#x27;s original separation from Asphodel. The township government moved back to Norwood, with the municipal office in Westwood becoming home to the local historical society.

== Geography ==

As is the case in the rest of Ontario, Asphodel–Norwood&#x27;s geography was sculpted by ice. The ice sheet which covered the region during the Wisconsin glaciation retreated approximately 12,000 years ago, and this retreated formed the geographic features of the township. The most prominent of these glacial land forms is the Peterborough Drumlin Field, which covers 2/3 of the township. The drumlins are teardrop shaped hills up to 50 metres high and up to 1 kilometre long. The drumlins are oriented in a northeastern direction reflecting the movement of the ice sheet. The northeast corner of the township is situated upon the Dummer Moraine. Moraines are buildup areas of rocks and soil pushed by glaciers as they move. The soil of the Dummer Moraine is characterized by the presence of an excessive amount of rocks and boulders. The Norwood esker is one of the longest and largest eskers in Peterborough County, with a total length of 32 kilometres. An esker is a ridge of sand and gravel formed within a glacier. The Norwood esker enters Asphodel–Norwood in the northeast corner, passes through Norwood, and continues on into Otonabee-South Monaghan where it terminates at Rice Lake.

Asphodel–Norwood has few major water features. The township is bounded by the Trent River for most of its southern boundary, and by Rice Lake in the southwest corner of the township. The only major river that passes through the township is the Ouse River. The main course of the Ouse has its headwaters in Douro-Dummer, and crosses into Asphodel–Norwood just to the north of Norwood, entering Norwood at the mill pond. The Norwood Mill Pond originated when Keeler dammed the Ouse to power his mill. From there it heads southwest to Westwood, turning south just east of said hamlet to join the Trent River. The West Ouse branch originates in Rotten Lake and enters Asphodel–Norwood 10 kilometres west of the main branch, heading in a generally southern direction towards and then through Westwood, after which it swings eastwards and joins the main branch.

===Communities===
The township of Asphodel–Norwood comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities such as Birdsall, Birdsall Station, Norwood and Westwood.

== Demographics ==

The town&#x27;s council includes a Mayor, Deputy-Mayor, and three councilors elected on the basis of one per ward. 

==Recreation==
Norwood has a modern single pad arena, a baseball diamond, a skateboard park, a children&#x27;s splash pad and a playground. The high school has soccer, rugby and football pitches. Norwood currently is home to the Norwood Vipers an OHA Sr. A hockey team. The town hockey teams are referred to as the Norwood Hornets.

===Minor hockey history===

The Norwood Hornets Minor Hockey Association (previously known as Norwood Minor Sports) has operated minor hockey programs for more than 80 years in the community of approximately 1,300.

The NMHA has operated out of three arenas since the Association&#x27;s inception in the 1920s. Originally the minor hockey programs skated in the Trent Valley League (TVL) holding games at the Spring Street Arena located north of Spring Street and south of Hwy. 7 (between Pine and Hwy.45). The Spring Street Arena was an outdoor facility that featured Norwood taking on TVL rivals such as neighboring Havelock, Hastings, Warsaw, Douro, Marmora and Keene.

In the mid-1950s, the G.A. Brethen Coliseum was built originally for use for the Norwood Fair, however, was converted into a hockey arena and was used until the year 2001 when the new Asphodel–Norwood Community Centre opened. Around this time, the Norwood programs participated in the Hastings &amp; District League against newer opponents such as Ennismore, Warkworth and Campbellford.

In the early 1980s, former National Hockey League (NHL) goaltender Marv Edwards settled in Norwood and implemented the Fundamentals In Action (FIA) skills development system. The program paid immediate dividends as the Hornets had unprecedented success from 1983 to 1992—winning seven (7) OMHA titles and participating in twelve (12) OMHA Finals between 1983 and 1994.

It was believed that much of Norwood&#x27;s minor hockey success was attributed to the Brethen Coliseum&#x27;s small, tight quarters. The ice surface was measured at 186 feet long by 72 feet wide. (NHL regulation ice is 200 x 85). The Coliseum&#x27;s ice was approximately 23% smaller than the traditional North American ice surface.

Norwood&#x27;s OMHA championship success over the years is one of the most successful among centres of its size (the DD and D classification) for communities under 5,000 residents.

The Hornets program has sent several players onto the various levels of Junior levels of hockey, however, the most notable was forward Fred Doherty who played professionally from 1908 until 1919, including stints in the Maritime Professional Hockey League and the National Hockey Association. After World War I, Doherty was called up to the Montreal Canadiens of the NHL and saw action in three games in the 1918–19 campaign for Montreal.

David Stewart, a key member of several OMHA championships in the mid-1980s, signed as a free agent with the Los Angeles Kings in 1992 after three years of major junior with the OHL&#x27;s Kingston Frontenacs. Stewart spent six years in the International Hockey League (IHL) and East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) playing for the Kings&#x27; farm teams in Phoenix, Toledo, Muskegon, Flint and Muskegon. Stewart&#x27;s final four professional seasons would be spent playing in Roanoke, Virginia, for the ECHL&#x27;s Roanoke Express. His efforts in Roanoke saw his jersey retired after just four years—only the 2nd jersey in Roanoke hockey history to be retired.

Today Stewart is settled in Norwood and operates the Norwood J.J. Stewart Motors Vipers OHA Senior A hockey team. Still playing at age 39, Stewart&#x27;s Vipers have competed in the Major League Hockey loop for the prestigious Allan Cup since 2006.

Greg Snetsinger, who was a defenceman on several of the same 1980&#x27;s Hornet teams, also went on to play four years of NCAA hockey at Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pennsylvania. Snetsinger graduated the Hornets and went on to play three seasons with the Lindsay Bears Jr. A. club before heading to the NCAA.

Mike Payne, a native of nearby Westwood, graduated Hornets programs at age 17 and played OHA Jr.B. for the Peterborough Roadrunners from 1987 to 1989 before playing four seasons for the University of Waterloo Warriors of the OUAA. While with the Roadrunners, Payne was a teammate of future NHLers, and Stanley Cup champions Darren McCarty and Jassen Cullimore.

The Norwood MHA also started girls hockey in the early-1990s and graduated Shanley White who played for the York University Lions of the OUAA and Heather Richardson to NCAA Division III women&#x27;s hockey at Colby College in Waterville, Maine.

After her playing days were over, Richardson went on to become one of the top women&#x27;s hockey referees in the world and officiated the 2010 Olympic Winter Games in Vancouver, BC. She was selected to be a lineswoman for the Gold Medal Final game between Canada and the US, a contest Canada won.

There have been numerous volunteers over the years who have donated their time to the Norwood Minor Hockey Association including Jim Lytle, who went on to be an OMHA Executive Member for 33 years. He was the goalie on the first OMHA finalist Bantam team in 1958.

The Hornets have had sixteen (16) O.M.H.A. Championships and seventeen (17) O.M.H.A. Finalists since 1958. 33 of Norwood&#x27;s OMHA Finals appearances came in a 27-year span from 1983 to 2010

==Education==
Norwood has four schools in three buildings. Norwood District Public School (elementary), St. Paul&#x27;s Elementary School (Catholic), Norwood Intermediate Public School (grade 8) and Norwood District High School. Norwood intermediate is now a wing of the High School.

<text>Jean Cavalier (28 November 1681 – 17 May 1740), was the Occitan Huguenot chief of the Camisards. He was born at Mas Roux, a small hamlet in the commune of Ribaute near Anduze, southern France.

==Early life==
His father, an illiterate peasant, had been compelled by persecution to become a Roman Catholic along with his family, but his mother brought him up secretly in the Protestant faith. In his boyhood he became a shepherd, and about his twentieth year he was apprenticed to a baker. Threatened with prosecution for his religious opinions he went to Geneva, where he spent the year 1701; he returned to the Cévennes on the eve of the rebellion of the Camisards, who by the murder of the Abbé du Chayla at Pont-de-Monvert on the night of 24 July 1702 raised the standard of revolt. Some months later he became their leader. He showed himself possessed of an extraordinary genius for war, and Marshal Villars paid him the high compliment of saying that he was as courageous in attack as he was prudent in retreat, and that by his extraordinary knowledge of the country he displayed in the management of his troops a skill as great as that of the ablest officers. Within a period of two years he was to hold in check Count Victor Maurice de Broglie and Marshal Montrevel, generals of Louis XIV, and to carry on one of the most terrible partisan wars in French history.

==Guerrilla==
He organised the Camisard forces and maintained the most severe discipline. As an orator he derived his inspiration from the prophets of Israel, and raised the enthusiasm of his rude mountaineers to a pitch so high that they were ready to die with their young leader for the sake of liberty of conscience. Each battle increased the terror of his name. On Christmas Day 1702 he dared to hold a religious assembly at the very gates of Alais, and put to flight the local militia which came forth to attack him. At Vagnas, on 10 February 1703, he routed the royal troops, but, defeated in his turn, he was compelled to find safety in flight. But he reappeared, was again defeated at Tour de Billot (30 April), and again recovered himself, recruits flocking to him to fill up the places of the slain.

By a long series of successes he raised his reputation to the highest pitch, and gained the full confidence of the people. It was in vain that more rigorous measures were adopted against the Camisards. Cavalier boldly carried the war into the plain, made terrible reprisals, and threatened even Nîmes itself. On 16 April 1704 he encountered Marshal Montrevel himself at the bridge of Nages, with 1000 men against 5000, and, though defeated after a desperate conflict, he made a successful retreat with two-thirds of his men. It was at this moment that Marshal Villars, wishing to put an end to the terrible struggle, opened negotiations, and Cavalier was induced to attend a conference at Pont d&#x27;Avne near Alais on 11 May 1704, and on 16 May he made submission at Nîmes. These negotiations, with the proudest monarch in Europe, he carried on not as a rebel but as the leader of an army which had waged an honourable war. Louis XIV gave him a commission as colonel, which Villars presented to him personally, and a pension of 1200 livres. At the same time he authorised the formation of a Camisard regiment for service in Spain under his command.

Before leaving the Cévennes for the last time he went to Alais and to Ribaute, followed by an immense concourse of people. But Cavalier had not been able to obtain liberty of conscience, and his Camisards almost to a man broke forth in wrath against him, reproaching him for what they described as his treacherous desertion. On 21 June 1704, with a hundred Camisards who were still faithful to him, he departed from Nîmes and came to Neu-Brisach (Alsace), where he was to be quartered. From Dijon he went on to Paris, where Louis XIV gave him audience and heard his explanation of the revolt of the Cévennes. Returning to Dijon, fearing to be imprisoned in the fortress of Neu-Brisach, he escaped with his troop near Montbéliard and took refuge at Lausanne.

But he was too much of a soldier to abandon the career of arms. He offered his services to the duke of Savoy, and with his Camisards made war in the Val d&#x27;Aosta. After the peace he crossed to England, where he formed a regiment of refugees which took part in the Spanish expedition under the earl of Peterborough and Sir Cloudesley Shovell in May 1705. At the battle of Almansa the Camisards found themselves opposed to a French regiment, and without firing the two bodies rushed one upon the other. Cavalier wrote later (10 July 1707): &quot;The only consolation that remains to me is that the regiment I had the honour to command never looked back, but sold its life dearly on the field of battle. I fought as long as a man stood beside me and until numbers overpowered me, losing also an immense quantity of blood from a dozen wounds which I received.&quot; Marshal Berwick never spoke of this tragic event without visible emotion.

On his return to England a small pension was given him and he settled at Dublin, where he published &quot;Memoirs of the Wars of the Cévennes under Col. Cavalier&quot;, written in French and translated into English with a dedication to Lord Carteret (1726). Though Cavalier received, no doubt, assistance in the publication of the &quot;Memoirs&quot;, it is nonetheless true that he provided the materials, and that his work is the most valuable source for the history of his life. He was made a general on 27 October 1735, and on 25 May 1738 was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Jersey. Writing in the following year (26 August 1739) he says: &quot;I am overworked and weary; I am going to take the waters in England so as to be in a fit condition for the war against the Spaniards if they reject counsels of prudence.&quot; He was promoted to the rank of major-general on 2 July 1739, and died in the following year. In the parochial register of St Luke&#x27;s, Chelsea, there is an entry: Burial A.D. 1740, 18 May, Brigadier John Cavalier.

There is a story which represents him as the fortunate rival of Voltaire for the hand of Olympe, daughter of Madame Dunoyer, author of the &quot;Lettres galantes&quot;. During his stay in England he married the daughter of Captain de Ponthieu and Marguerite de la Rochefoucauld, refugees living at Portarlington. Malesherbes, the courageous defender of Louis XVI, bears the following eloquent testimony to this young hero of the Cévennes: &quot;I confess,&quot; he says, &quot;that this warrior, who, without ever having served, found himself by the mere gift of nature a great general, this Camisard who was bold to punish a crime in the presence of a fierce troop which maintained itself by little crimes—this coarse peasant who, when admitted at twenty years of age into the society of cultivated people, caught their manners and won their love and esteem, this man who, though accustomed to a stormy life, and having just cause to be proud of his success, had yet enough philosophy in him by nature to enjoy for thirty-five years a tranquil private life—appears to me to be one of the rarest characters to be found in history.&quot;

<doc id="617930" wikidata="Q407290" url="?curid=617930" title="Nitrobenzene">
<text>Nitrobenzene is an aromatic nitro compound and the simplest of the nitrobenzenes, with the chemical formula C6H5NO2. It is a water-insoluble pale yellow oil with an almond-like odor. It freezes to give greenish-yellow crystals. It is produced on a large scale from benzene as a precursor to aniline. In the laboratory, it is occasionally used as a solvent, especially for electrophilic reagents. As confirmed by X-ray crystallography, nitrobenzene is a planar molecule.

==Production==
Nitrobenzene is prepared by nitration of benzene with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric acid, water, and nitric acid. This mixture is sometimes called &quot;mixed acid.&quot; The production of nitrobenzene is one of the most dangerous processes conducted in the chemical industry because of the exothermicity of the reaction (Δ&quot;H&quot; = −117 kJ/mol).

World capacity for nitrobenzene in 1985 was about 1,700,000 tonnes.

The nitration process involves formation of the nitronium ion (NO2+), followed by an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of it with benzene. The nitronium ion is generated by the reaction of nitric acid and an acidic dehydration agent, typically sulfuric acid:
:HNO3 + H+ NO2+ + H2O

==Uses==
Approximately 95% of nitrobenzene industrially produced is hydrogenated to aniline: 
:C6H5NO2 + 3 H2 → C6H5NH2 + 2 H2O
Aniline is a precursor to urethane polymers, rubber chemicals, pesticides, dyes (particularly azo dyes), explosives, and pharmaceuticals.

===Specialized applications===
Nitrobenzene is used to mask unpleasant odors in shoe and floor polishes, leather dressings, paint solvents, and other materials. Redistilled, as oil of mirbane, nitrobenzene had been used as an inexpensive perfume for soaps. It has been replaced by less toxic chemicals for this purpose. A significant merchant market for nitrobenzene is its use in the production of the analgesic paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen). Nitrobenzene is also used in Kerr cells, as it has an unusually large Kerr constant. Evidence suggests its use in agriculture as a plant growth/flowering stimulant.

===Organic reactions===
Aside from its conversion to aniline, nitrobenzene can be selectively reduced to azoxybenzene, azobenzene, nitrosobenzene, hydrazobenzene, and phenylhydroxylamine. It has been used as a mild oxidant in reactions like the Skraup quinoline synthesis.

==Safety==
Nitrobenzene is highly toxic (Threshold Limit Value 5 mg/m3) and readily absorbed through the skin.

Prolonged exposure may cause serious damage to the central nervous system, impair vision, cause liver or kidney damage, anemia and lung irritation. Inhalation of vapors may induce headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, cyanosis, weakness in the arms and legs, and in rare cases may be fatal. The oil is readily absorbed through the skin and may increase heart rate, cause convulsions or rarely death. Ingestion may similarly cause headaches, dizziness, nausea, vomiting and gastrointestinal irritation, loss of sensation/use in limbs and also causes internal bleeding.

Nitrobenzene is considered a likely human carcinogen by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and is classified by the IARC as a Group 2B carcinogen which is &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot;. It has been shown to cause liver, kidney, and thyroid adenomas and carcinomas in rats.

It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002), and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Cloudesley Shovell (c. November 1650 – 22 or 23 October 1707) was an English naval officer. As a junior officer he saw action at the Battle of Solebay and then at the Battle of Texel during the Third Anglo-Dutch War. As a captain he fought at the Battle of Bantry Bay during the Williamite War in Ireland.

As a flag officer Shovell commanded a division at the Battle of Barfleur during the Nine Years&#x27; War, and during the battle distinguished himself by being the first to break through the enemy&#x27;s line. Along with Admiral Henry Killigrew and Admiral Ralph Delaval, Shovell was put in joint command of the fleet shortly afterwards.

During the War of the Spanish Succession, Shovell commanded a squadron which served under Admiral George Rooke at the capture of Gibraltar and the Battle of Málaga. Working in conjunction with a landing force under the Earl of Peterborough, his forces undertook the siege and capture of Barcelona. He was appointed commander-in-chief of the Navy while at Lisbon the following year. He also commanded the naval element of a combined attack on Toulon, base of the main French fleet, in coordination with the Austrian army under Prince Eugene of Savoy in the summer of 1707. Later that year, on the return voyage to England, Shovell and more than 1,400 others perished in a disastrous shipwreck off the Isles of Scilly.

Along with his naval service, Shovell served as MP for Rochester from 1695 to 1701 and from 1705 until his death in 1707.

==Early career==
Born in Cockthorpe, the son of John Shovell, a Norfolk gentleman, and Anne Shovell (née Jenkinson), Shovell was born into a family &quot;of property and distinction&quot; which, although not poor, was by no means wealthy. He was baptised on 25 November 1650. The unusual first name of Cloudesley derives from the surname of his maternal grandmother Lucy Cloudisley, who was the daughter of Thomas Cloudisley (d. 1618) of Cley next the Sea, Norfolk.

He went to sea as a cabin boy in the care of a paternal relative, Admiral Sir Christopher Myngs, in 1663. After Myngs&#x27; death in 1666 he remained at sea in the care of Admiral Sir John Narborough. He set himself to study navigation, and, owing to his able seamanship and brave disposition, became a general favourite and obtained quick promotion. Promoted to midshipman on 22 January 1672, he was assigned to the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal Prince&quot;, flagship of the Duke of York, and saw action when a combined British and French fleet was surprised and attacked by the Dutch, led by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, at the Battle of Solebay off the Suffolk coast in May 1672, during the Third Anglo-Dutch War.

Promoted to master&#x27;s mate on 17 September 1672, Shovell transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Fairfax&quot; later that month and then moved to the third-rate HMS &quot;Henrietta&quot; in November 1672. He saw action again when a combined British and French fleet attempting to land troops in the Netherlands was repelled by a smaller Dutch force, again led by Admiral de Ruyter, at the Battle of Texel in August 1673. Promoted to lieutenant on 25 September 1673, he transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Harwich&quot; in 1675 and took part in an action against the pirate stronghold at Tripoli. Shovell led a surprise attack on the pirates, sinking a number of their ships in January 1676. For this action he received the sum of £80 from Narborough. Two months later he undertook a second raid against the pirates, for which he was awarded a gold medal from King Charles II. In a letter from the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys recorded the King&#x27;s satisfaction with Shovell&#x27;s actions; he transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Plymouth&quot; in May 1677 and was sent to the Mediterranean.
Promoted to captain 17 September 1677, Shovell was given command of the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Sapphire&quot;. He transferred to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Phoenix&quot; in April 1679 and returned to HMS &quot;Sapphire&quot; in May 1679 before transferring to the fifth-rate HMS &quot;Nonsuch&quot; in July 1680. He returned to HMS &quot;Sapphire&quot; again in September 1680 and then transferred to the sixth-rate HMS &quot;James Galley&quot; in April 1681, to the third-rate HMS &quot;Anne&quot; in April 1687 and to the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Dover&quot; in April 1688. Throughout this period Shovell was engaged in the defence of Tangier from Salé raiders.

Shovell transferred to the command of the third-rate HMS &quot;Edgar&quot; in April 1689 and saw action at the Battle of Bantry Bay in May 1689, when a French fleet tried to land troops in Southern Ireland to fight Prince William of Orange during the Williamite War in Ireland. After the battle, Commodore John Ashby and Shovell were knighted. He transferred to the third-rate HMS &quot;Monck&quot; in October 1689 and ordered to patrol the area between Ireland and the Isles of Scilly. In June 1690 he was commodore of a small squadron, which convoyed King William across St George&#x27;s Channel to Carrickfergus.

==Senior command==

Promoted to rear-admiral on 3 June 1690, Shovell hoisted his flag in the first-rate HMS &quot;Royal William&quot;. He provided naval support for Percy Kirke&#x27;s Capture of Waterford in July 1690 commanding the Irish Squadron. He commanded a division of the Red squadron at the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue in May 1692, in which Russell&#x27;s Anglo-Dutch fleet intercepted and defeated the French fleet under Tourville, on its way along the Channel to provide an escort for an invasion of England. At Barfleur Shovell&#x27;s flagship was the first ship to break through the enemy&#x27;s line, and in the latter stages of the battle he organised a fireship attack. He received a wound in the thigh during the action, which later incapacitated him during preparations for the attack which destroyed the French ships that had taken refuge at La Hogue. Along with Admirals Henry Killigrew and Ralph Delaval, Shovell was put in joint command of the fleet in January 1693. After the disastrous attack on the Smyrna convoy off Lagos, Portugal, in June 1693, all three admirals were dismissed from their joint command. Promoted to vice admiral on 16 April 1694, Shovell commanded a squadron on expeditions to Dieppe and Dunkirk, later in the year.

Shovell set up residence with his wife at May Place in Crayford in 1694 and was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester in 1695. He was responsible for the restoration of St. Paulinus&#x27; Church in Crayford and was a great benefactor to Rochester, providing at his own expense the fine decorated plaster ceilings in the Guildhall and the market bell, clock and decorated brick facade for the Butchers&#x27; Market (now the Corn Exchange). He was also Commissioner of the Sewers, responsible for the upkeep of the embankments of the Thames between Deptford and Gravesend. He did not stand for re-election to Parliament in December 1701.

==War of the Spanish Succession==

Promoted to full admiral on 6 May 1702, Shovell brought home the spoils of the French and Spanish fleets, which had been captured by Admiral George Rooke at the Battle of Vigo at an early stage of the War of the Spanish Succession, arriving in England in late 1702. After commanding a fleet dispatched to take troops to Lisbon in Spring 1703, he commanded a squadron which served under Rooke at the capture of Gibraltar in August 1704 and also repulsed the French fleet at the Battle of Málaga later that month. He was appointed a member of the council of the Lord High Admiral (an office vested at that time in Prince George of Denmark) in December 1704, appointed Rear-Admiral of England on 26 December 1704 and promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 13 January 1705.

He was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester again in 1705. In May 1705 he was given command of the Mediterranean Fleet in partnership with Earl of Peterborough. Peterborough&#x27;s forces undertook the siege and capture of Barcelona in September 1705. Shovell was given complete control of the Mediterranean Fleet while at Lisbon in November 1706. He commanded the naval element of a combined attack on Toulon, base of the main French fleet, in coordination with the Austrian army under Prince Eugene of Savoy in the summer of 1707. The allies failed to capture the city, but bombardment by Shovell&#x27;s forces panicked the French into scuttling their own fleet. Shovell was subsequently ordered to bring his fleet home in late October 1707.

==Death in the Scilly naval disaster==

While returning with the fleet to England after the campaign at Toulon, Shovell&#x27;s flagship, the second-rate HMS &quot;Association&quot;, struck the rocks near the Isles of Scilly at 8 pm on 22 October (2 November, by the modern calendar) 1707. HMS &quot;Association&quot; went down in three or four minutes, with none of the 800 men that were on board saved, according to sailors watching on the first-rate HMS &quot;St George&quot;. Four large ships, HMS &quot;Association&quot;, the third-rate HMS &quot;Eagle&quot;, the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Romney&quot; and the fire ship HMS &quot;Firebrand&quot; all sank.

With nearly 2,000 sailors lost that night, the Scilly naval disaster was recorded as one of the greatest maritime disasters in British history. The cause of the disaster has often been represented as the navigators&#x27; inability to accurately calculate their longitude, although no public discussion of the events specifically raising the question of longitude is known, prior to a pamphlet published on the eve of Parliament&#x27;s vote on the Longitude Act, seven years later.

Shovell&#x27;s body and those of both his stepsons were all found in Porthellick Cove on St Mary&#x27;s, almost from where his ship was wrecked. It was possible that Shovell left his flagship in one of its boats along with his two stepsons and the captain of HMS &quot;Association&quot;, Edmund Loades, and that they were drowned while trying to get to shore.

Shovell&#x27;s body was identified by the purser of the third-rate HMS &quot;Arundel&quot;, who knew the admiral well. It was identified by &quot;a black mole under his left ear, also by the first joint of one of his forefingers being broken inwards. He had likewise a shot in his right arm, another in his left thigh&quot;. Shovell was temporarily buried on the beach at Porthellick Cove. By order of Queen Anne the body was later exhumed and brought back in the fourth-rate HMS &quot;Salisbury&quot; to Plymouth, where it was embalmed by Dr James Yonge. It was later carried in state to London. During the journey from the West Country, large crowds turned out to pay their respects. He was interred in Westminster Abbey on 22 December 1707: his large marble monument in the south choir aisle was sculpted by Grinling Gibbons. Meanwhile, his two stepsons were buried in Old Town Church on St Mary&#x27;s.

Local legend has it that Shovell was alive, at least barely, when he reached the shore of Scilly at Porthellick Cove but was murdered by a woman for the sake of his priceless emerald ring, which had been given to him by a close friend, Captain James Lord Dursley. At that time, the Scillies had a wild and lawless reputation. It is claimed that the murder came to light only some thirty years later when the woman, on her deathbed, confessed to a clergyman to having killed the admiral and produced the stolen ring, which was sent back to Dursley. Several historians doubt the murder story as there is no indication that the ring was recovered and the legend stems from a romantic and unverifiable deathbed confession.

Another legend alleges that a common sailor on the flagship tried to warn Shovell that the fleet was off course but Shovell had him hanged at the yardarm for inciting mutiny. The story first appeared in the Scilly Isles in 1780, with the common sailor being a Scilly native, who recognized the waters as being close to home but was punished for warning the admiral. Some versions of the legend report that the sailor cursed Shovell to suffer a watery grave before his execution. While it is possible that a sailor may have debated the vessel&#x27;s location and feared for its fate (such debates were common upon entering the English Channel, as noted by Samuel Pepys in 1684), the story has been repeatedly discredited by naval scholars, who noted the lack of any evidence in contemporary documents and its fanciful stock conventions and dubious origins. After his death Shovell became a popular British hero.

==Family==
In 1691 Shovell married Elizabeth Hill, Lady Narborough (1661–1732), the widow of his former commander, Rear Admiral Sir John Narborough. Through her, he had two stepsons (Sir John Narborough, 1st Baronet, and James Narborough), who both entered naval careers and died, aged 23 and 22, at the sinking of HMS &quot;Association&quot; in October 1707. Shovell and his wife also had two daughters: Elizabeth and Anne. Elizabeth married Lord Romney, whilst Anne married John Blackwood.

== In popular media ==
Actor Jonathan Coy was cast as Shovell in the Channel 4 TV series, &quot;Longitude&quot; in 2000.

<text>Admiral Sir John Narborough (or Narbrough, c. 1640–1688) was an English naval commander. He served with distinction in the Anglo-Dutch Wars and against the pirates of the Barbary Coast. He is also known for leading a poorly understood expedition to Valdivia and Patagonia in 1670–1671. In the 1680s he was involved in the scavenging of wrecked Spanish treasure ships.

==Life==
===Early life===
Narborough was descended from an old Norfolk family. He married and had two surviving sons and a daughter by Elizabeth Hill, whose father was John Hill, a Commissioner of the Navy. After her husband&#x27;s death, Lady Narborough married Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell.

Narborough served as cabin boy to Christopher Myngs and his later cabin boy was Cloudesley Shovell. Narborough was promoted to lieutenant in 1664 and in 1666 to Captain, for gallantry in an action against the Dutch fleet off the Downs in June of that year.

===Expedition to Patagonia===
After the peace, he was chosen to conduct a secretive voyage in the South Seas. He set sail from Deptford on 26 September 1669, and entered the Straits of Magellan in October of the following year. In 1670 he visited Port Desire in Argentina and claimed the territory for the Kingdom of England. Having made landings at various points the expedition finally arrived to the heavily fortified Corral Bay on late December 1670. There the expedition established contact with the Spanish garrison whose commanders were highly suspicious of Narborough&#x27;s intentions despite England being at peace with Spain. The Spanish demanded and received four English hostages in exchange for allowing Narborough&#x27;s ship into the bay. Despite claiming to be in distress and in need of provisions the Spanish refused to give provisions given that the crews seemed to be in healthy condition and Narborough&#x27;s true intentions being unclear to them. Narborough then unexpectedly made the decision to leave, and his ship departed Corral Bay on 31 December. The four English hostages and a man known as Carlos Enriques were left behind and ended up in the prisons of Lima where they were subject to lengthy interrogations, as the Spanish struggled to find out the goal of Narborough&#x27;s expedition. Narborough returned home in June 1671 without achieving his original purpose. A narrative of the expedition was published at London in 1694 under the title &quot;An Account of several late Voyages and Discoveries to the South and North&quot;.

===Third Anglo-Dutch War, Barbary corsairs===
During the Third Anglo-Dutch War Narborough was second captain of the Lord High Admiral&#x27;s ship, . He conducted himself with conspicuous valour at the Battle of Sole Bay in May 1672, after the death in action of his superior, Sir John Cox, and won approbation. Shortly after he was promoted to rear-admiral and knighted. In 1675 he was sent to suppress the Barbary piracies, and by despatching gun-boats into the harbour of Tripoli at midnight and burning the ships, he induced the Dey to agree to a treaty. An account of the raid appears in the diary of a naval chaplain, Henry Teonge. The lieutenant responsible for the harbour burnings was Cloudesley Shovell, who later married Narborough&#x27;s widow. Shortly after returning, Narborough undertook a similar expedition against the Algerines.

===Commissioner of the Navy, treasure hunting and death===
In 1680 Narborough was appointed Commissioner of the Navy, an office he held until his death in 1688. During those years he was a patron to a treasure hunter from New England, invested in an expedition by William Phips to find wrecked Spanish treasure ships in the Caribbean, and sought for the support of Charles II and others in the venture. Phips&#x27;s first expedition, made in 1682 and funded by New England investors, was marginally successful. His second, in 1683–1685, was less successful, but gained valuable leads, and Narborough helped him to raise funds for a third expedition. Departing in September 1686, Phips located a valuable wreck in February 1687 and returned to England with treasure valued at over £200,000, which gained him approbation and a knighthood. After this success, Narborough decided to lead a follow-up expedition in the following year. Returning to the wreck, the English found it had been discovered by others. They recovered only about £10,000 of treasure before Narborough fell ill and died at sea in May 1688.
Narborough had bought the Knowlton Court estate, near Dover, from the executors of Sir Thomas Peyton, and so was buried in St Clement&#x27;s Church. His eldest son John was created a baronet in November 1688 (see Narborough Baronets) in honour of his father. Sir John died with his brother James and their stepfather Admiral Sir Cloudesley Shovell aboard during the Scilly naval disaster of 1707. Narborough&#x27;s widow is buried in St Paulinius&#x27;s Church, Crayford, where there is a memorial to her and her second husband. Narborough&#x27;s two sons were buried in the Old Town Church on St Mary&#x27;s, Isles of Scilly.

Knowlton Court passed to Narborough&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth, who had married Sir Thomas D&#x27;Aeth in 1701.

==Legacy==
Knowlton church has monuments to Sir John and to his sons. The latter depicts the grounding of the &quot;Association&quot;. Fernandina Island, westernmost in the Galapagos archipelago, was long named Narbrough or Narborough Island in his honour by the 17th-century buccaneer William Ambrosia Cowley.

<doc id="617943" wikidata="Q1608145" url="?curid=617943" title="Herbert Chitepo">
<text>Herbert Wiltshire Pfumaindini Chitepo (15 June 1923 – 18 March 1975) was a Zimbabwean politician and nationalist leader who led the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) until he was assassinated in March 1975. Although his assassin remains unidentified, the Rhodesian author Peter Stiff says that a former soldier of the British Special Air Service (SAS), Hugh Hind, was responsible.

Chitepo became the first black citizen of Rhodesia to become a barrister.

==Early years==
Chitepo was born in Watsomba village in the Mutasa District of Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe on 15 June 1923. His family came from the Manyika clan (Samanyika) of the Shona people. He was educated at St David&#x27;s Mission School, Bonda, St Augustine&#x27;s School, Penhalonga and then at Adams College, Natal, South Africa, where he qualified as a teacher in 1945. This was where he met Victoria Mahamba-Sithole, a South African whom he married in 1955.

==Early career==
After teaching for a year, he resumed his studies to graduate with a Bachelor of Arts from Fort Hare University College in 1949. He qualified as a barrister-at-law, and was called to the bar by Gray&#x27;s Inn. He was a research assistant at the School of Oriental and African Studies. He was the first African in Southern Rhodesia to qualify as a barrister. In 1954, Chitepo became Rhodesia&#x27;s second black lawyer after Prince Nguboyenja Khumalo son of King Lobengula (a special law was required to allow him to occupy chambers with white colleagues). On returning to Rhodesia in 1954, he practised as a lawyer and defended African nationalists such as Ndabaningi Sithole in court. In February 1960, he travelled to the US with support from the African-American Institute. In 1961, he served as legal adviser to Joshua Nkomo, founder of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU), at the Southern Rhodesia Constitutional Conference in London. In the same year, he was also appointed to the board of governors of Bernard Mizeki College along with Sir. W. C .R. Honey and Sir Robert Tredgold. The Southern Rhodesian government did not detain him, as he did not come out in the open as an official of the nationalist movement, and the regime also feared that he was too internationally well known to be locked up.

==ZANU==
In May 1962 ZAPU was banned because of militarism and Chitepo was persuaded to go into voluntary exile to escape possible detention. He became Tanganyika&#x27;s first African director of public prosecutions. The Ndabaningi Sithole and Joshua Nkomo factions of ZAPU split apart in July 1963. Nkomo&#x27;s supporters founded the PCC-ZAPU (later just called ZAPU again) and favoured a more militaristic approach. As the more moderate faction, Chitepo sided with Sithole and was elected chairman of ZANU (having defeated Nathan Shamuyarira) from its foundation. He held this post until 7 December 1974, when the Lusaka Accord was signed.

Both parties vied for domination but in 1964 both were banned and the leaders were all arrested. Both parties chose to leave the country and reorganise and form armies from outside Rhodesian borders, although they chose different countries to make their base. ZAPU based itself in the West and Zambia where it organised ZIPRA (the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army.) They allied with the Soviet Union and organised a vanguard of highly trained soldiers. ZANU, however, moved into Tanzania and then to Mozambique and set up ZANLA (Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army) which concentrated more on mobilising the masses in the countryside in a method pioneered by the Chinese.

In January 1966 Chitepo resigned as director of Public Prosecutions and moved to Zambia to concentrate on the armed struggle. He toured world capitals canvassing support for ZANU and for the enforcement of total economic sanctions against Rhodesia. With his friendly disposition, he was very effective and earned for ZANU international recognition and respect.

Sithole and others prepared a comprehensive document giving powers to Chitepo to lead ZANU while Rev. Sithole was in detention and specifically authorising him to carry out the armed struggle. Accordingly, Herbert Chitepo with the military supremo Josiah Tongogara from the Karanga ethnic community, organised and planned successful military guerilla attacks and underground activities in Rhodesia from 1966 onwards. In 1972, he coordinated war operations with FRELIMO and opened up the northeastern region of Zimbabwe as a new and effective war front.

==Death==
Chitepo died on 18 March 1975 in Lusaka, Zambia, when a car bomb, placed in his Volkswagen Beetle the night before, exploded. He and Silas Shamiso, one of his bodyguards, were killed instantly. Sadat Kufamadzuba, his other bodyguard, was injured. The explosion sent part of the car onto the roof of his house and uprooted a tree next door. Hours later one of his neighbours died of injuries he sustained in the explosion. ZANU at the time blamed the Rhodesian Security Forces.

Zambian president Kenneth Kaunda commissioned an inquiry into Chitepo&#x27;s death. Documents released in October 2001, placed the blame on ZANU infighting. However, in his biographical account, &quot;The Legend of the Selous Scouts&quot;, Lt Col Ronald Reid-Daly, officer commanding, Selous Scouts Regiment, Rhodesian Security Forces, clearly states that the Rhodesian Central Intelligence Organization (CIO) under the leadership of Director General Ken Flower, masterminded the assassination of Herbert Chitepo, subsequently planting documentary evidence blaming ZANU members.

&quot;The decision by Ken Flower ... to assassinate Herbert Chitepo, head of the ZANU War Council, now showed how badly Flower has misread the ZANU/ZANLA situation. The death of Chitepo purged ZANU of its many dissenting factions and a new and highly successful leader emerged. Robert Mugabe gave ZANLA the means to consolidate its efforts by providing ZANLA with an indispensable factor – unity.&quot; [pg. 173 &quot;The Legend of The Selous Scouts&quot;]

<doc id="617944" wikidata="Q919095" url="?curid=617944" title="Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance is an award presented at the Grammy Awards to recording artists for works (songs or albums) containing quality performances in the heavy metal music genre. The Grammy Awards is an annual ceremony, where honors in several categories are presented by The Recording Academy of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;. The ceremony was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards.

The Recording Academy recognized heavy metal music artists for the first time at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards (1989). The category was originally presented as Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental, combining two of the most popular music genres of the 1980s. Jethro Tull won that award for the album &quot;Crest of a Knave&quot;, beating Metallica, which were expected to win with the album &quot;...And Justice for All&quot;. This choice led to widespread criticism of The Recording Academy, as journalists suggested that the music of Jethro Tull did not belong in the hard rock or heavy metal genres. In response, The Recording Academy created the categories Best Hard Rock Performance and Best Metal Performance, separating the genres.

The Best Metal Performance category was first presented at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990, and was again the subject of controversy when rock musician Chris Cornell (lead vocalist for the band Soundgarden) was perplexed by the academy&#x27;s nomination of the band Dokken in this category. Metallica won in the first three years. The awards were presented for the song &quot;One&quot;, a cover version of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Stone Cold Crazy&quot;, and the album &quot;Metallica&quot;. During 2012–2013, the award was temporarily discontinued in a major overhaul of Grammy categories; all solo or duo/group performances in the hard rock and metal categories were shifted to the newly formed Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category. However, in 2014, the Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance category was split, returning the Best Metal Performance category and recognizing quality hard rock performances in the Best Rock Performance category.

The award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Metallica holds the record for the most wins in this category, with a total of seven. Tool has received the award three times. Black Sabbath, Nine Inch Nails, Ozzy Osbourne and Slayer have each received the award twice. The band Ministry holds the record for the most nominations without a win, with six, while the band Megadeth holds the record for most nominations before their first win, winning on their 10th nomination. Poppy is the only female solo artist to be nominated in the category, 30 years after the establishment of the category.

<text>Weather lore is the body of informal folklore related to the prediction of the weather and its greater meaning.

Much like regular folklore, weather lore is passed down through speech and writing from normal people without the use of external measuring instruments. The origin of weather lore can be dated back to primeval men and their usage of star studying in navigation. However, more recently during the Late Middle Ages, the works of two Greek philosopher-poets, Theophrastus of Eresus on Lesbos and Aratus of Macedonia, are known for shaping the prediction of weather. Theophrastus and Aratus collated their works in two main collections for weather lore: &quot;On Weather Signs&quot; and &quot;On Winds.&quot; These were used for helping farmers with harvest, merchants for trade and determining the weather the next day.

Astrology and weather lore have been closely interlinked for many years - with each planet often being associated with a weather state. For example, Mars is red and must therefore be hot and dry. Prevalent in ancient Roman thought, astrologists used weather lore to teach commoners of the star and cloud formations and how they can be used to see the future. From this, three main schools of weather lore thoughts developed during the Late Middle Ages as Astrology became more popular throughout Europe. One which related to winds and clouds and had some scientific basis. A second type connected with saints&#x27; days possessed doubtful validity but was quite popular nonetheless during the Middle Ages. A third type treated the behaviour of birds and animals, which has been found to be controlled more by past and present weather rather than to be a true indication of the future.

Before the invention of temperature measuring devices, such as the mercury thermometer, it was difficult to gather predictive, numerical data. Therefore, communities used their surroundings to predict and explain the weather in upcoming days.

Today, the majority of weather lore can be found in proverbs. However, much of the weather lore fantasy is still prevalent in today&#x27;s seasonal calendar, with mentions such as the annual saints&#x27; days, the passage of the months, and weather predictions made from animal behaviour. The creation of the astrological signs in Babylonian mythology can also be attributed to the study of stars and its association with weather lore.

==Occurrence of &quot;weather&quot;==
Weather can be defined as the constant shift in conditions relating to temperature, cloudiness, rainfall etc. at a particular time and place. A significant portion of weather occurs in Earth&#x27;s middle latitudes, between roughly 30° to 60° North and South.

A great percentage of the world&#x27;s population lives in the equatorial regions, but for the most part, these regions do not experience weather as it is understood by this definition. The Sahara in northern Africa, for instance, is almost uniformly hot, sunny and dry all year long especially due to the non-stop presence of high atmospheric pressure aloft, whereas weather trends on the Indian subcontinent and in the western Pacific, for instance, the monsoonal belt, occur gradually over the very long term, and the diurnal weather patterns remain constant.

Weather folklore, therefore, refers to this mid-latitude region of daily variability. While most of it applies equally to the Southern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere resident may need to take into account the fact that weather systems rotate opposite to those in the North. For instance, the &quot;crossed winds&quot; rule (see below) must be reversed for the Australian reader.

==Common proverbs==

=== When clouds look like black smoke ===
::&quot;When clouds look like black smoke&quot;
::&quot;A wise man will put on his cloak&quot;

Thick, moisture-laden storm clouds absorb sunlight. It gives them an appearance that somewhat resembles black smoke.

=== Red sky at night ===

::&quot;Red sky at night, shepherd&#x27;s delight.&quot;
::&quot;Red sky in the morning, shepherd&#x27;s warning.&quot;

(In a common variation, &quot;shepherd&quot; is replaced by &quot;sailor&quot;)

A red sky – in the morning or evening – is a result of high pressure air in the atmosphere trapping particles of dust or soot. Air molecules scatter the shorter blue wavelengths of sunlight, but particles of dust, soot and other aerosols scatter the longer red wavelength of sunlight in a process called Rayleigh scattering. At sunrise and sunset, the sun is lower in the sky causing the sunlight to travel through more of the atmosphere so scattering more light. This effect is further enhanced when there are at least some high level clouds to reflect this light back to the ground.

When weather systems predominantly move from west to east, a red sky at night indicates that the high pressure air (and better weather) is westwards. In the morning the light is eastwards, and so a red sky then indicates the high pressure (and better weather) has already passed, and an area of low pressure is following behind.

=== Low-pressure regions ===
::&quot;When the wind is blowing in the North&quot;
::&quot;No fisherman should set forth,&quot;
::&quot;When the wind is blowing in the East,&quot;
::&quot;&#x27;Tis not fit for man nor beast,&quot;
::&quot;When the wind is blowing in the South&quot;
::&quot;It brings the food over the fish&#x27;s mouth,&quot;
::&quot;When the wind is blowing in the West,&quot;
::&quot;That is when the fishing&#x27;s best!&quot;

In western European seas, this description of wind direction is an excellent illustration of how the weather events of an active low pressure area present themselves. With the approach of a low, easterly winds typically pick up. These gusty winds can be unpleasant for a number of reasons; they are often uncomfortably warm, dry, and dusty in the summer and bitterly cold in the winter. Northerly winds, which follow around a low, are cold and blustery. Sailing in conditions of northerly winds requires expertise and a boat capable of handling heavy waves. Southerly winds usually bring warm temperatures, and though they may not necessarily feed the fish, they do provide pleasant fishing weather. Wind and weather observations will be different for a low passing to the north of the observer than for one passing to the south. When a low passes to the north, the winds typically pick up from the east, swing to southerly (possibly accompanied by light precipitation, usually not) with the passage of the low&#x27;s warm front, and then switch to northwesterly or westerly as the cold front passes. Typically, if there is any heavy precipitation, it will accompany the passage of the cold front. When a low passes to the south, on the other hand, winds will initially pick up from the east, but will gradually shift to northerly. Overcast skies and steady precipitation often occur as the center of the low passes due south, but skies will clear and winds will gradually become westerly as the low moves off to the east. No observer will experience all the weather elements of a low in a single passage.

=== Calm conditions ===
:&quot;No weather is ill if the wind be still.&quot;

Calm conditions, especially with clear skies, indicate the dominance of a high pressure area. Because highs are broad regions of descending air, they discourage the formation of phenomena typically associated with weather, such as clouds, wind, and precipitation. Calm conditions, though, may also result from a circumstance known as &quot;the calm before the storm,&quot; in which a large thunderstorm cell to the west may be updrafting the westerly surface wind before it can arrive locally. This situation is readily identifiable by looking to the west – such an approaching storm will be close enough to be unmistakable. In winter, though, calm air and clear skies may signal the presence of an Arctic high, typically accompanied by very cold air, and it is difficult to imagine describing a temperature of –35 °C (–31 °F) as pleasant.

=== Ring around the Moon ===
::&quot;When halo rings the Moon or Sun, rain&#x27;s approaching on the run&quot;

A halo around the Sun or Moon is caused by the refraction of that body&#x27;s light by ice crystals at high altitude. Such high-level moisture is a precursor to moisture moving in at increasingly lower levels, and is a good indicator that an active weather system is on its way. Halos typically evolve into what is known as &quot;milk sky&quot;, when the sky appears clear, but the typical blue is either washed-out or barely noticeable. This high, thick cirrostratus cloud is a clear indicator of an approaching low. In the coldest days of winter, a halo around the Sun is evidence of very cold and typically clear air at and above the surface. But sun dogs are indicators that weather conditions are likely to change in the next 18 to 36 hours.

=== Humidity indicators ===
:&quot;When windows won&#x27;t open and the salt clogs the shaker,&quot;
:&quot;The weather will favour the umbrella maker!&quot;

Moisture in the air causes wood to swell, making doors and windows sticky, and salt is a very effective absorber of moisture. With a high level of moisture in the air, the likelihood of precipitation is increased. The magnesium carbonate and later calcium silicate in iodized salt acts as an anti-clumping agent in humid conditions, leading to Morton Salt&#x27;s umbrella girl logo and slogan &quot;When it rains, it pours&quot;.

=== Fog ===
:&quot;A summer fog for fair,&quot;
:&quot;A winter fog for rain.&quot;
:&quot;A fact most everywhere,&quot;
:&quot;In valley or on plain.&quot;
Fog is formed when the air cools enough that the vapour pressure encourages condensation over evaporation. In order for the air to be cool on a summer night, the sky must be clear, so excess heat can be radiated into space. Cloudy skies act like a blanket, absorbing and reradiating the heat, keeping it in. So if it is cool enough (and clear enough) for fog to form, it will probably be clear the next day. Winter fog is the result of two entirely different circumstances. Above the ocean or a large lake, air is typically more humid than above land. When the humid air moves over cold land, it will form fog and precipitation. (To the east of the North American Great Lakes, this is a common phenomenon, and is known as the &quot;lake effect.&quot;) In northerly climates, ice fog may form when the temperature drops substantially below freezing. It is almost exclusively an urban phenomenon, when the air is so cold that any vapor pressure results in condensation, and additional vapour emitted by automobiles, household furnaces, and industrial plants simply accumulates as fog.
=== Cloud movement ===
:&quot;If clouds move against the wind, rain will follow.&quot;

This rule may be true under a few special circumstances, otherwise it is false. By standing with one&#x27;s back to the ground-level wind and observing the movement of the clouds, it is possible to determine whether the weather will improve or deteriorate. For the Northern Hemisphere, it works like this: If the upper-level clouds are moving from the right, a low-pressure area has passed and the weather will improve; if from the left, a low pressure area is arriving and the weather will deteriorate. (Reverse for the Southern Hemisphere.) This is known as the &quot;crossed-winds&quot; rule. Clouds traveling parallel to but against the wind may indicate a thunderstorm approaching. Outflow winds typically blow opposite to the updraft zone, and clouds carried in the upper level wind will appear to be moving against the surface wind. However, if such a storm is in the offing, it is not necessary to observe the cloud motions to know rain is a good possibility. The nature of airflows &quot;directly at&quot; a frontal boundary can also create conditions in which lower winds contradict the motions of upper clouds, and the passage of a frontal boundary is often marked by precipitation. Most often, however, this situation occurs in the lee of a low pressure area, to the north of the frontal zones and convergence region, and does not indicate a change in weather, but rather, that the weather, fair or showery, will remain so for a period of hours at least.

=== Fallibility of lore===

One of the problems in testing the veracity of traditions about the weather is the wide variety to be found in the details of sayings and traditions. Some variations are regional, while others exhibit less of a pattern.

==== Empirical studies ====

One case where weather lore has been studied for reliability against actual weather observations is the Groundhog Day lore. It predicts that if the groundhog sees its shadow on this day (February 2), six weeks of winter remain. One analysis concluded the creature demonstrated no ability to predict. Other studies gave accuracy percentages, but differing figures. and some of the numbers were slightly better than hazarded guess (33% accurate), according to one source. In other words, there is no appreciable correlation between cloud cover on that day, and the imminence of springlike weather.

There are some meteorological bases suggested, but it is a fuzzy mechanism, and fixing a precise date compromises the effectiveness.

== Calendrical lore ==
There are weather lore marked by dates on the year&#x27;s calendar.

===January===
The Hispanic tradition of &quot;cabañuelas&quot; predicts the weather for the year based on the 12, 18 or 24 days of January or August.

===February===

There are weather lore around February 2, known as Candlemas, Brigid&#x27;s Day, or St. Blaise&#x27;s Day (St. Blaze&#x27;s Day). One French lore says that if it rains on Candlemas (&quot;Chandeleur&quot;) there will be forty more days of rain: &quot;Quand il pleut pour la Chandeleur, il pleut pendant quarante jours&quot;. Groundhog Day also falls on this day.

====Candlemas and animals====
Groundhog Day, observed in the U. S. and Canada, also falls on February 2 and is thought to derive from the Candlemas weather lore in Europe, particularly the German which features the badger as the predictor. An example of such German weather rhyme translates as:

:&quot;If the badger is in the sun at Candlemas,&quot;
:&quot;he will have to go back into his hole for another four weeks&quot;.

There are also French counterparts. One for Saint-Vallier in Lorraine states:
:&quot;If it is fair weather on Candlemas,&quot; 
:&quot;the bear returns to its cave for six weeks&quot;&quot;

And another from Courbesseaux says that if it is sunny on Candlemas the wolf returns to its cave for six weeks, and if not, for forty days.

In French Canada, it may be a marmot or groundhog (&quot;siffleux&quot;), bear, skunk, otter etc. which if it sees its shadow on Candlemas, causes winter to prolong for 40 days.

English traditional weather lore recites, 
&quot;If Candlemas Day be fair and bright
Winter will have another fight
If Candlemas Day brings cloud and rain
Winter won&#x27;t come again&quot;

===March===
====Lion and Lamb====

An English proverb describes typical March weather:

: &quot;March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb.&quot;

In the 19th century it was used as a prediction contingent on a year&#x27;s early March weather:

: &quot;If March comes in like a lion, it will go out like a lamb.&quot;

====March thunderstorms====
:&quot;When March blows its horn,&quot;
:&quot;your barn will be filled with hay and corn.&quot;

&quot;Blows its horn&quot; refers to thunderstorms. While March thunderstorms indicate that the weather is unusually warm for that time of year (thunderstorms can occur only with a sufficiently large temperature difference between ground and sky and sufficient amounts of moisture to produce charge differential within a cloud).

===July===
In the British Isles, Saint Swithun&#x27;s day (July 15) is said to forecast the weather for the rest of the summer. If St Swithun&#x27;s day is dry, then the legend says that the next forty days will also be dry: &quot;St.Swithin&#x27;s Day if thou be fair, &#x27;Twill rain for forty days no mair; St. Swithin&#x27;s Day if thou dost rain, For forty days it will remain.&quot;. If however it rains, the rain will continue for forty days.

There is a scientific basis to the legend of St Swithun&#x27;s day. Around the middle of July, the jet stream settles into a pattern which, in the majority of years, holds reasonably steady until the end of August. When the jet stream lies north of the British Isles then continental high pressure is able to move in; when it lies across or south of the British Isles, Arctic air and Atlantic weather systems predominate.

===August===
The Hispanic tradition of &quot;cabañuelas&quot; predicts the weather for the year based on the first 12, 18 or 24 days of January or August.

===November===
A Swedish proverb uses 30 November (St Andrew&#x27;s day, referencing the name day of Anders, a localised variant) as an indicator of the weather over Christmas (&quot;Anders slaskar, julen braskar&quot;, translation: Slushy Anders [St. Andrew&#x27;s day], frozen Christmas).

===Other feast days===
In France, Saint Medard (June 8), Urban of Langres (April 2), and Saint Gervase and Saint Protais (June 19) are credited with an influence on the weather almost identical with that attributed to St Swithun in England, while in Flanders there is St Godelieve (July 6) and in Germany the Seven Sleepers Day (June 27).

In Russia, the weather on the feast of the Protecting Veil is popularly believed to indicate the severity of the forthcoming winter.

There was an old proverb from Romagna that ran: &quot;Par San Paternian e&#x27; trema la coda a e&#x27; can.&quot; (&quot;On St. Paternian&#x27;s day, the dog&#x27;s tail wags&quot;). This Cervian proverb refers to the fact that the cold began to be felt around the saint&#x27;s feast day. A farmers&#x27; saying associated with Quirinus&#x27; feast day of March 30 was &quot;Wie der Quirin, so der Sommer&quot; (&quot;As St. Quirinus&#x27; Day goes, so will the summer&quot;).

The Ice Saints is the name given in German, Austrian, and Swiss folklore to a period noted to bring a brief spell of colder weather in the Northern Hemisphere under the Julian Calendar in May, because the Roman Catholic feast days of St. Mamertus, St. Pancras, and St. Servatus fall on the days of May 11, May 12, and May 13 respectively.

In Northern Spain, the four yearly periods of ember days (&quot;témporas&quot;) are used to predict the weather of the following season.

==Biological signs==
===Animal signs===
====Seagulls====
Sometimes the lore is concurrent with existing conditions, more than prediction, as in:
:&quot;Seagull, seagull sit on the sand.&quot;
:&quot;It&#x27;s never good weather when you&#x27;re on land.&quot;

Seagulls tend to sleep on the water. However, seagulls, like people, find gusty, turbulent wind difficult to contend with, and under such circumstances, the water is also choppy and unpleasant. Seagulls huddled on the ground may be a sign that the weather is already bad.

====Cows in pasture====

:&quot;A cow with its tail to the West makes the weather best,&quot;
:&quot;A cow with its tail to the East makes the weather least&quot;

Cows prefer not to have the wind blowing in their faces, and so typically stand with their backs to the wind. Since westerly winds typically mean arriving or continuing fair weather and easterly winds usually indicate arriving or continuing unsettled weather, a cowvane is as good a way as any of knowing what the weather will be up to for the next few hours.

====Pets eating grass====
:&quot;Cats and dogs eat grass before a rain.&quot;

While it is true that cats and dogs eat grass, it has nothing to do with the weather and is because cats and dogs are not exclusively carnivorous. Some researchers believe that dogs eat grass as an emetic when feeling ill.

==== Frogs ====

Centered in the German-speaking world, there was the belief that frogs could predict the weather. It grew from observing European tree frogs climb up vegetation in sunny weather, and led to frogs being held inside jars equipped with a small ladder. The term &quot;Wetterfrosch&quot; (&quot;weather frog&quot;) has survived as a humorous, if somewhat derogatory epithet for meteorologists, insinuating their predictions can not be trusted.

==== Leeches ====
Some early barometers used leeches in a jar to predict when a storm was coming. This is because leeches tend to climb and become agitated when low pressure is approaching. Ref 

===Plant signs===
====Onion skins====
:&quot;Onion skins very thin&quot;
:&quot;Mild winter coming in;&quot;
:&quot;Onion skins thick and tough&quot;
:&quot;Coming winter cold and rough.&quot;

This verse, and so many others like it, attempts to predict long-range conditions. These predictions have stood the test of time only because they rely on selective memory: people remember when they have predicted correctly and forget when predictions don&#x27;t hold. One possible factor which could provide these predictions with a thin edge of credibility is that there is some degree of consistency in weather from year to year. Drought cycles or El Niño winters are a perfect example of such circumstances. A pattern of cool summers and warm winters, for instance, can produce patterns in other natural events sensitive enough to be affected by changes in temperature or precipitation.

==Meteorological signs==
===Early-morning rain===
:&quot;Rain before seven, clear by eleven.&quot;

Late-night rains and early morning rains may simply be the last precipitation of a passing weather front. However, since fronts pass at night as often as they do in the day, morning rain is no predictor of a dry afternoon. However, this lore can describe non-frontal weather. Given sufficient surface heating, a late-day rainstorm may continue to develop into the night, produce early precipitation, then dissipate by late morning. This, though, is the exception rather than the rule. Only 40% of rain is produced by convective events – 60% is the result of a frontal passage.

<text>Roland Laporte (1675 – 14 August 1704), better known as Roland, was a Camisard leader who was born at Mas Soubeyran (Gard) in a cottage that has become the property of the Socité de l&#x27;Histoire du Protestantisme français and contains relics of the hero.

He was a nephew of Laporte, the Camisard leader, who was hunted down and shot in October 1702, and became the leader of a band of a thousand men which he formed into a disciplined army with magazines, arsenals and hospitals. For daring in action and rapidity of movement he was second only to Jean Cavalier. Both leaders in 1702 secured entrance to the town of Sauve under the pretence of being royal officers, burnt the church and carried off provisions and ammunition for their forces.

Roland, who called himself general of the children of God, terrorized the country between Nîmes and Alais, burning churches and houses, and slaying those suspected of hostility against the Huguenots, though without personally taking any part of the spoil. Cavalier was already in negotiation with Marshal Villars when Roland cut to pieces a Catholic regiment at Fontmorte in May 1704.

He refused to lay down his arms without definite assurance of the restoration of the privileges accorded by the Edict of Nantes. Villars then sought to negotiate, offering Roland the command of a regiment on foreign service and liberty of conscience, though not the free exercise of their religion, for his co-religionists. This parley had no results, but Roland was betrayed to his enemies, and on 14 August 1704 was shot while defending himself against his captors. The five officers who were with him surrendered, and were broken on the wheel at Nîmes. Roland&#x27;s death put an end to the effective resistance of the Cévenois.

<doc id="617962" wikidata="Q2491279" url="?curid=617962" title="Adán Sánchez">
<text>Adán Santos Sánchez Vallejo (April 14, 1984 – March 27, 2004), known professionally as Adán Chalino Sánchez in honor of his father, was a Mexican-American singer and composer. Like his father, he specialized in regional Mexican music.

==Biography==
Sánchez was born in Torrance, California, the son of singer Chalino Sánchez. He was eight years old when his father was kidnapped and killed in the Mexican state of Sinaloa in 1992. His father&#x27;s popularity skyrocketed after his death in 1992, giving way to a long series of compilation records, postmortem releases, and dedications. Raised by his mother in Paramount, California, he took up singing, adopting his father nickname, &quot;Chalino&quot;, and gained a strong local fan base among Mexican-American teenagers.

Sánchez recorded his first full-length album in 1994, entitled &quot;Soy el Hijo de Chalino&quot;, notable for the 10-year-old&#x27;s brash and assertive vocals; the album&#x27;s rousing title track evokes the style of celebrated singers from Mexico&#x27;s Golden Age. As he grew into his teens, the majority of Sánchez&#x27;s album titles began to revolve around the loss of his father, i.e., &quot;La Corona de Mi Padre&quot; and &quot;Homenaje a Mi Padre&quot;. He was also able to widen the genre&#x27;s popularity even further to teenage girls, thanks to his teen idol persona and focus on contemporary romantic ballads.

== Kodak Theatre concert ==
On March 20, 2004, Sánchez gave a concert and made history when he became the youngest headliner and first Regional-Mexican recording artist to sell out the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood. The songs he performed during his concert were &quot;Necesito un amor&quot; (I need a love), &quot;Morenita&quot; (Little brown one), &quot;Paloma negra&quot; (Black dove), &quot;Fui tan feliz&quot; (I was so happy), &quot;Y dicen&quot; (And they say), &quot;Me canse de morir por tu amor&quot; (I&#x27;m tired of dying for your love) and a medley of some of his father Chalino’s greatest hits, accompanied by images of him projected on large screens above the stage.

==Death==

One week after the concert, on March 27, 2004, Sánchez embarked on a promotional road-based tour through his father&#x27;s home state of Sinaloa, Mexico. He was on his way to a concert in Tuxpan, Nayarit, Mexico, on the highway between Rosario and Escuinapa, when the 1990 Ford LTD Crown Victoria, owned by his father, blew a tire. It was confirmed he was not wearing his seatbelt at the time the accident occurred. According to police, the driver lost control and the vehicle rolled into a ditch. The performer sustained severe head injuries and was found dead at the scene, 18 days shy of his 20th birthday. More than 10,000 fans filled the streets outside the Los Angeles church where his funeral Mass was held.

==Funeral and legacy==
Sánchez&#x27;s remains were returned to the United States, where his family scheduled a public wake on April 1, 2004, at the St. John of God Church in Norwalk, California. The event drew national media attention for sparking civil unrest in the neighborhood surrounding the church that evening. As Sánchez was not well known among English-speaking authorities, local law enforcement vastly underestimated his fan base, and they were unprepared when more than 15,000 young people jammed the streets to attend the service. As the day wore on, the crowd of mourners grew out of control—Police were brought in to disperse the crowd, wearing riot gear and carrying pellet guns. Their appearance incited anger among members of the crowd, who surged into the streets, overturning portable toilets and rocking cars. It was reported that Sánchez&#x27;s aunt Juanita Sánchez wept about the crowd&#x27;s behavior: &quot;Adán wouldn&#x27;t have wanted people to act like this. It just causes more pain to the family&quot;, she said.

In 2005, a memorial statue was built for Adán in front of La Que Buena radio station in Burbank, California.
== &quot;Always and Forever&quot; ==
In 2009, &quot;Always &amp; Forever&quot;, a stage play by Michael Patrick Spillers, dramatized the impact of Sánchez&#x27;s death on a group of young people in South Los Angeles. The play examines various aspects of Mexican-American culture (such as quinceañeras and Jesús Malverde).

<text>Jimo District (), formerly Jimo City (), is a District of Qingdao, Shandong.

==Location==

==History==
Jimo was established in the Eastern Zhou dynasty, at which time it was the second largest settlement in Shandong. The Siege of Jimo in 279 BC, otherwise unremarkable, is remembered for the ruse that ended it. Tian Dan was a general of the State of Qi who had just lost 70 cities to the Yan. When Jimo, their penultimate city, was under fire, he collected more than 1,000 oxen, tied sharp daggers to their ears, tied straw to their tails, and dressed them in colourful cloth to make them look like dragons. At dead of night the Qi set the tails alight and drove the oxen towards the enemy camp. The panicking enemy soldiers were wiped out, and the Qi regained all the lost cities.

=== German Colony and the Siege of Tsingtao ===
On the 6th of March, 1898, the city of Tsimo (Jimo) became part of the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory. By the time of the First World War, the Germans had set up a small outpost in Tsimo, which on the 13th of September, 1914, was taken by advancing Japanese cavalry during the Siege of Tsingtao. After its capture, Japanese cavalry and engineers alongside the 23rd Infantry Brigade would arrive at Tsimo on the 18th of September. During the siege, an airfield was built and by the 21st of September, Japanese Army Nieuport IV.Gs began operating from Tsimo in an unsuccessful attempt to bomb the German airfield and destroy the lone Rumpler Taube. After the end of the war, the Kiautschou Bay Leased Territory (along with Tsimo) was ceded to Japan and returned to the Chinese in 1922.

<text>The purple sunbird (Cinnyris asiaticus) is a small bird in the sunbird family. It occurs in parts of the Arabian peninsula and South and Southeast Asia. It has a fast and direct flight and can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird but often perches at the base of flowers. It feeds mainly on nectar and insects, especially when feeding young. The males can appear all black in harsh sunlight but the purple iridescence is visible on closer observation or under good light conditions. Females are olive above and yellowish below.

==Description==
The purple sunbird has a relatively short bill, a dark and short square ended tail with distinctive sexual dimorphism. Less than long they have a down-curved bill with brush-tipped tubular tongues that aid in nectar feeding. The male is glossy metallic bluish to purplish black on the upper parts with the wings appearing dark brown. The breeding male also has underparts of the same purplish black, but non-breeding males may show a central streak of black on yellow underparts. In the breeding plumage, the male can be confused with the syntopic Loten&#x27;s sunbird which has a long bill and a distinctive broad maroon band on the breast. Breeding males will sometimes show their yellow in displays. There is a patch of bright blue on the shoulder of breeding males. The maroon shine on the feathers of the collar around the neck is visible mainly during the breeding seasons.

Females are olive brown above with a yellowish underside. There is a pale supercilium beyond the eye. There is a darkish eye stripe. The throat and breast are yellow, becoming pale towards the vent. The outer tail feathers are tipped in white both in the male and female.
The young are just like females in plumage, however, the males get black feathers as they become adults. 
They are seen in pairs or small groups and aggregations may be found in gardens with suitable flowers. They feed mainly on nectar but also take fruits and insects. Groups of as many as 40 to 50 individuals have sometimes been noted.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is distributed widely from West Asia through the Indian subcontinent and into Southeast Asia. They are resident birds in most parts of their range and do not move large distances. They are found in thin forest and garden land, including those in dense urban areas. Local movements are, however, noted especially in the drier parts of northwestern India and Pakistan where they are said to arrive in large numbers before summer.

The nominate subspecies is distributed in India east of the desert region and south of the Himalayas extending to the west and south of India and Sri Lanka. It mainly inhabits the plains but going up to in southern India and up to in the Himalayas. The race &quot;brevirostris&quot; is found in the dry zone from the Arabian Peninsula into Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan until the dry zone of Rajasthan and Gujarat. These may, however, winter south near Goa. This form has a slight tinge of green in the pectoral yellow tufts. The race &quot;intermedius&quot; extends from the border of Orissa and Andhra Pradesh northwards into Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indochina.

The movements of the purple sunbird is not well understood. A male ringed in Bharatpur was recovered in Dehra Dun about to the north.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These birds are very vociferous and will call and will join to mob owls or other predators. The song is rapid rattle followed by ringing, metallic notes. Other call notes include a &quot;chwit&quot; or &quot;chwing!&quot; notes. The primary breeding season is before the Monsoons, April to June in northern India and January to June in Sri Lanka. While feeding they flick their wings. They rarely hover at flowers and usually perch to forage for nectar. They are important pollinators of some plant species such as &quot;Butea monosperma&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Woodfordia&quot; and &quot;Dendrophthoe&quot;. but they sometimes steal nectar by slitting flowers such as &quot;Hamelia patens&quot; at the base. They are known to feed on small berries such as those of &quot;Salvadora persica&quot; and cultivated grapes. Insects are sometimes caught by flycatching.

In courtship displays the male raises his head, fans his tail and flutters with partly open wings that expose the pectoral tufts and sings before the female. The nest is a pouch made of cobwebs, thin strips of vegetation, lichens and bark. The entrance hole on the side is often shaded by an overhanging projection. The nest is built almost entirely by the female. The nest material is not woven and most of it is held together by cobwebs. About five to ten days may be taken in the building of the nest. The inner cavity is expanded by the bird by opening its wing and turning around on the inside. In Sri Lanka and in southern India, it sometimes builds its nest by modifying and lining the cobweb structures formed by colonial or &#x27;social&#x27; spiders, &quot;Stegodyphus sarasinorum&quot; (Eresidae). Two eggs are usually laid. The nest is usually suspended from a low branch, often of thorny plants but are sometimes built close to human habitations, attached to wires or other man-made objects and even indoors in an unused toilet. Only the female incubates the eggs which hatch after 15 to 17 days. Males assist in feeding the chicks although females involve themselves to a greater extent, making more trips as the chicks get older.

Sunbirds have been known to live for nearly 22 years in captivity.

<doc id="617973" wikidata="Q2066668" url="?curid=617973" title="Domain name speculation">
<text>Domain name speculation, popular as domain investing, domain flipping or domaining in professional jargon, is the practice of identifying and registering or acquiring generic Internet domain names as an investment with the intent of selling them later for a profit.

The main targets of domain name speculation are generic words which can be valuable for type-in traffic and for the dominant position they would have in any field due to their descriptive nature. Hence generic words and phrases such as &quot;poker&quot;, &quot;insurance&quot;, &quot;travel&quot;, &quot;creditcards&quot;, &quot;loan&quot; and others are attractive targets of domain speculation in any top-level domain, the most popular of which is .com.

The speculative characteristics of domain names may be linked to news reports or current events. However, the effective period during which such opportunities exist may be limited. Quick turnaround in the resale of domains is often called &quot;domain flipping&quot;. Domain flipping may also involve the process of buying a valuable domain name and building a related website around it, all this with the objective of selling the domain and newly built website to an interested party.

==Concept==
Sometimes, domain name speculation involves finding domain names early in a market, particularly when a new top-level domain is launched, registering them and waiting until the market grows to sell them. Domains such as voice.com, sex.com, and fund.com have sold for millions of US dollars.

The COM top-level domain (or &#x27;TLD&#x27;) is the focus of most domain speculation activity as it is the largest TLD. Domain speculation occurs in other TLDs as well, such as NET and to a lesser extent in ORG, INFO, and BIZ. Of the Generic top-level domains, INFO is the most popular by registration volume compared to BIZ gTLD due to the low cost of initial registration and the recognizability of INFO as being an abbreviation of &quot;information&quot;.

Domain name speculation also occurs in country code top-level domains (ccTLDs) such as .uk, .de and .us. The German TLD consists of over 12 million domains. The UK&#x27;s domain has over 7.7 million domains registered according to Nominet&#x27;s domain registration statistics webpage, mainly in its commercial sub-domain co.uk. These TLDs are mature markets where good domain names may command high prices. The EU ccTLD is an example of what happens when speculative activity overtakes &quot;ordinary&quot; domain registrations. A combination of an inept registry (EURid) and excessive speculation by businesses exploiting a poorly structured regulatory framework meant that, according to EURid&#x27;s own statistics at the end of 2006, over 50% of the registrations could be considered at best speculative and at worst domain name warehousing.

Specialist and &quot;repurposed&quot; ccTLDs have also seen elements of domain name speculation. One of the best examples is that of the .tv ccTLD which has found the fact that &quot;TV&quot; is an abbreviation for the word television to be rather lucrative. The .mobi TLD is a good example of a specialist TLD in that it is specifically targeted at mobile phones and similar mobile technology. The operators of .mobi, mTLD, have reserved some of the premium generic words which will be auctioned off. The intent is to create a more level playing field for those interested in developing websites. The .mobi premium generic words and phrases list is a good example of the domain names that are at the heart of most early-market domain name speculation.

Domain name speculators, sometimes known as domainers or domain investors, also register domain names based on seemingly generic phrases such as &quot;propertyforsale&quot; in the hope that these domain names could be sold later to businesses. Some (but not all) domain name investors will try to stay away from domain names containing trademarks as this could be considered cybersquatting.

Some country code TLDs or sponsored TLDs will have what is referred to as an eligibility or nexus requirement to limit registration to specific geographical or national regions. However this does not deter domain name speculation as various options such as using a local agent or company to enable people to register domains in such TLDs exist and have been used.

==Evolution==
Domain name speculation has evolved with the expansion of the domain name system. Domain names were registered primarily for business purposes. In the 1990s, much of the ccTLD landscape had yet to appear, and the growing public awareness of the COM TLD was gathering momentum owing to the growth of the Dot-com bubble. This inevitably attracted the attention of those who saw potential value in domain names, and by this time many of the most valuable generic domain names, such as sex.com and business.com, had been registered. No clear legal position existed to distinguish domain name speculation and cybersquatting. Due to the open nature of most TLDs, anyone could register a domain name. This led to the development of the Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy in 1999.

==Distinction from cybersquatting==
A common accusation against domain name speculation is that it is cybersquatting. Cybersquatting is defined as registering, trafficking in, or using a domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The key element in this definition is that the intellectual property rights of another&#x27;s trademark are infringed by the cybersquatter. For a UDRP action to succeed one of the things that the complainant has to establish is that the domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights. Legitimate domain name speculation tends to steer clear of trademarks and concentrate on generic words and phrases as domains based on trademarks can be subject of UDRP actions by the trademark owners. As the number of registered domain names has increased, the number of UDRP cases has also increased. Trademark and service mark owners now use brand protection services that monitor TLDs for newly registered domains that potentially infringe on their trademarks. This is due in part to typosquatting, a form of cybersquatting where variations of the spelling of a brand&#x27;s domain will be registered in an attempt to profit from users mistyping the URL of the site they wish to visit.

Generic terms, such as the term &quot;salt&quot; when used in connection with sodium chloride, are not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing a product or service. This means that generic terms are generally not afforded any legal protection. The Canned Foods, Inc. v. Ult Search Inc. decision specifically deals with a case involving a generic term, &quot;Grocery Outlet&quot; and the domain name &quot;groceryoutlet.com&quot;. The decision contains the key sentence &quot;Generic terms receive no protection in US trademark law when they are used to label the goods and services that they describe.&quot;

Cybersquatting was first used as a legal term in March 1998 by a U.S. District Court in California in the case of &quot;Avery Dennison vs Sumpton&quot;. An early definition of the practice was given in &quot;Intermatic Inc. v. Toeppen&quot;, 947 F. Supp. 1227 (N.D. Ill. 1996). The definition was &quot;These individuals attempt to profit from the Internet by reserving and later reselling or licensing domain names back to the companies that spent millions of dollars developing the goodwill of the trademark.&quot;

As domain name speculation has evolved alongside the domain name system, the most memorable and shortest domains tend to be amongst those registered first in any TLD. For old TLDs like COM (introduced in 1985), these domains will be long gone and people registering their first domains are often frustrated at the lack of short and memorable domains in this and other mature TLDs.

One of the main problems concerning trademarks and domain names in unrestricted TLDs and gTLDs is that of trademarks in general: the rights of the trademark owner have to be asserted in order to protect the trademark. The trademark owner has to take legal action, typically a UDRP, to defend the trademark after the potentially infringing domain has been registered. The UDRP action has to follow a procedure of notifying the respondent, receiving a reply from the respondent, appointing an adjudication panel and awaiting a decision. The process can take two months or more and all costs (typically more than $1,000 even for a single domain) are borne by the complainant, while the infringing party stands to lose nothing except the registration fee (usually under $10) for the original domain and the registrar of the infringing name incurs no penalty at all.

The global and unrestricted nature of TLDs and gTLDs effectively means that anyone in any country can register a domain name in them regardless of whether they have any intellectual property rights in that name. With country code TLDs the jurisdiction is more clearly defined. The affected intellectual property rights owner would have to take a legal action, typically a UDRP case to transfer or cancel the domain unless the registrant is in the same jurisdiction as the affected intellectual property rights owner. In this case, local law may be sufficient as the action may be considered as common law tort of passing off.

==Primary market speculation==
The primary market for domain name speculation covers newly registered domain names that have not been registered before. Such domain names are often linked to news and current events. The launch of a new TLD encourages primary market speculation as domainers rush to register generic terms and also phrases that make a pun on the TLD name (domain hack). Other more organised domainers or domain name speculators register trademarks in advance of the launch of new TLDs specifically in order to register these short, memorable and potentially high value domains in the sunrise period of new gTLD launches. The Sunrise period is when intellectual property rights owners (trademark owners etc.) can register their trademark in the new gTLD in advance of the gTLD being opened for general registrations. In the last three years the main new TLDs launched were .eu ccTLD, .mobi TLD and .asia sTLD. All of these had landrush periods of varying success.

== Secondary market speculation ==
The secondary market for domain names covers previously registered domain names that have not been renewed by registrants or are available for resale. Sometimes these &quot;dropped&quot; domain names can be more valuable due to their having had high-profile websites associated with them. They will have links from other websites and could still have users searching for the websites because of these links. Others can be valuable because of the generic nature of the domain name or the length of the domain name, with two and three character names being the most sought after.

The business of registering the domain names as they are deleted by the registries is known as &quot;drop catching&quot;. It is a highly competitive business. The main operators in this business typically set up a number of front companies as registrars. VeriSign, in the case of TLDs COM and NET, allows each registrar a slice of the resources that may be used to register dropped domains. VeriSign drops domains in a random order, giving registrars only a vague idea of the particular drop time of a particular domain. Sometimes a group of drop registrars often work in confederation to increase their possibility of registering a dropped domain immediately after it is deleted by the registry. If the domain is caught by a confederation of registrars attempting to fulfill a domain backorder, then whichever domain registrar caught the domain will register it to the entity who backordered the domain. If the newly reregistered domain is captured by a company that has no customers who backordered it, the domain may be auctioned to the highest bidder by the registrar who captured it or an auction intermediary. The time between a drop and a capture is often measured in seconds or fractions thereof.

Some registrars do not allow domains to drop in the normal fashion, instead introducing an intermediary (e.g., Snapnames and Namejet) that auction the domain prior to their deletion. If nobody buys the domain at auction, it will pass through the normal deletion process.

==Domain name speculation and the rise of Pay per click websites==
Cybersquatting has a clear legal definition, but this definition tends to be lost when people open a webpage with only pay per click (&#x27;PPC&#x27;) advertising. It is often assumed that such a domain is &quot;cybersquatted&quot;, especially when the person is searching for the domain in order to register it.

The ease with which PPC revenue could be derived from parked domains effectively created a situation where domains were being registered purely for their type-in traffic. Many of exact phrases that people were searching for in search engines were being registered for the sole purpose of serving PPC advertising. The COM TLD grew from 23,662,001 registered domains 1 January 2003 to 80,759,835 registered domains as of 1 January 2009. While part of that increase in the number of registered domain names is due to the increase in ecommerce and business conducted online, some of the increase is due to the ease of generating revenue from PPC and type-in traffic. Domain tasting, a practice by which millions of domains would be registered for a limited period (the five-day Add Grace Period during which a domain could be deleted without the registrar effectively having to pay a registration fee to ICANN) and only those generating sufficient revenue from PPC advertising would be retained, also served to increase the number of domains registered. This practice involved domain name registrars being created purely for the purpose of domain tasting. The situation became so bad in 2007 that ICANN was forced to take action. In June 2008 ICANN added a provision to its Fiscal Year 2009 budget to limit the number of domains that a registrar could delete using the Add Grace Period before having to pay the ICANN fee. The effect of this was to massively curtail the number of domains deleted in .com and .net during the Add Grace Period. From June 2008 to April 2009, AGP deletions fell by 99.7%.

The March 2006 Verisign Domain Brief stated that out of approximately 57.37 million COM and NET websites spidered, 26% were single page websites, 60% were multipage websites and 14% had no associated websites. Numerically, the number of single page websites was approximately 14.91 million. The single page websites include under-construction, brochure-ware and parked pages in addition to online advertising revenue generating (PPC) parked pages.

The latest statistics for domain name usage quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief for June 2009 states that of the 92 million COM and NET domain names, 24% of these domains have one page websites, 64% have multipage websites and 12% have no associated websites. In purely numerical terms, those single page websites would account for approximately 22 million COM and NET websites. The survey quoted in the Verisign Domain Brief does not explain the methodology or provide anything other than a summary of the results. However this is effectively a rise in single page websites of just over 7 million websites.

Some hosters such as Godaddy have their own domain parking systems and allow unused domains to be parked with the registrant receiving a share of the PPC revenue earned. Other hosters have similar systems.

<doc id="617976" wikidata="Q316827" url="?curid=617976" title="Louis-François de Boufflers">
<text>Louis François de Boufflers, Duke of Boufflers (10 January 1644 – 22 August 1711) was a prominent French soldier in the age of Louis XIV of France. He was created count of Cagny (modern Crillon) and duke of Boufflers and named marshal of France. He was famed for his excellent defensive leadership during the sieges of Namur and Lille, next to his conduct during the Battle of Malplaquet.
==Biography==
Louis-François was born at Crillon in Oise on 10 January 1644. He entered the army and saw service in 1663 at the Siege of Marsal, becoming colonel of dragoons in 1669. In the conquest of Lorraine (1670), he served under the &quot;Marshal de Créqui&quot;. In the Dutch Republic, he served under Henri de la Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, Vicomte de Turenne, frequently distinguishing himself by his skill and bravery; and when Turenne was killed by a cannon shot in 1675, he commanded the rear-guard during the retreat of the French army. He was already a brigadier, and in 1677 he became &quot;maréchal de camp&quot;.

He served throughout the campaigns of the time with increasing distinction, and in 1681 became lieutenant-general. He commanded the French army on the Moselle, which opened the War of the Grand Alliance with a series of victories. On 15 October 1688, he took the important fortress Mainz, the &quot;Aureum caput regni&quot;, with 20,000 soldiers, then he led a corps to the Sambre, and reinforced François Henri de Montmorency, Duke of Piney on the eve of the Battle of Fleurus (1690).

In 1691, he acted as lieutenant-general under the king in person; and during the investment of Mons he was wounded in an attack on the town. He was present with the king at the siege of Namur in 1692, and took part in the victory of Steinkirk. For his services he was raised in 1692 to the rank of Marshal of France, and in 1694 was made a duke. In 1693, he married Catherine Charlotte de Gramont.

In 1694, he was appointed governor of French Flanders and of the town of Lille. He was besieged in Namur in 1695, and only surrendered to his besiegers after he had lost 8,000 of his 13,000 men. In the conferences which terminated in the Peace of Ryswick he had a principal share.

During the following war (the War of the Spanish Succession) in 1702 Boufflers attempted to capture Nijmegen and to save Kaiserswerth, but this was unsuccessful. The next year he led a Franco-Spanish force at the Battle of Ekeren. In 1708, when Lille was threatened with a siege by John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugène of Savoy, Boufflers was appointed to the command, and made a most gallant resistance of three months.

He was rewarded and honoured by the king for his defence of Lille, as if he had been victorious. It was indeed a species of triumph; his enemy, appreciating his merits, allowed him to dictate his own terms of capitulation. In 1708 he was made a peer of France. In 1709, when the affairs of France were threatened with the most urgent danger, Boufflers offered to serve under his junior, Claude Louis Hector de Villars, Marshal-Duke of Villars, and was with him at the Battle of Malplaquet. Here he displayed the highest skill, and after Villars was wounded he conducted the retreat of the French army without losing either cannon or prisoners. He died at Fontainebleau on 22 August 1711.

==Personal life==
He married Catherine Charlotte de Gramont, daughter of Antoine Charles de Gramont, Duke of Gramont. They had one son, Joseph Marie de Boufflers, Duke of Boufflers (22 May 1706 - 2 July 1747). Louis-François&#x27; daughter, Louise Antoinette Charlotte, married his cousin, Charles François de Boufflers.

==Titles==
Louis-François bore several titles, but was generally known as the &#x27;. He is also known as the &#x27; (&quot;Duke of Boufflers&quot;) and (&quot;Count of Cagny&quot;).

<doc id="617979" wikidata="Q2118693" url="?curid=617979" title="Regional Representative Council">
<text>The Regional Representative Council (, DPD; alternatively translatable as the House of Regions or the House of Regional Representatives or the Senate of Indonesia), is one of two parliamentary chambers in Indonesia. Together with the House of Representatives ([[Regional Representative Council|DPR]]), it makes up the Indonesian national legislative body, the &quot;Majelis Permusyawaratan Rakyat&quot; ([[Regional Representative Council|MPR]]). Under Indonesia&#x27;s constitution, the authority of the DPD is limited to areas related to regional governments and can only propose and give advice on bills to the DPR. Unlike the DPR, the DPD has no direct law-making power. Its members are usually called senators instead of DPD members.

==History==
The idea of regional representation in parliament was initially accommodated in the original version of the 1945 Constitution, with the concept of &quot;Utusan Daerah&quot; (Regional Representatives) in the MPR, along with &quot;Utusan Golongan&quot; (Group Representatives) and members of the DPR. This is regulated in Article 2 of the constitution, which states that &quot;&quot;The MPR consists of members of the DPR plus representatives from regions and groups, according to the rules established by law&quot;.&quot; This loose arrangement was then further regulated by various laws and regulations.

In the Constitution of the United States of Indonesia enacted in 1949, the idea was realized in the form of &quot;Senat Republik Indonesia Serikat&quot; (Senate of the United States of Indonesia), representing the states and working side by side with the DPR.

As a replacement for &quot;Utusan Daerah&quot;, the DPD was created by the third amendment to the 1945 Constitution enacted on 9 November 2001 in a move towards bicameralism. The DPD does not have the revising powers of an upper house like the United States Senate. Article 22D restricts the DPD to dealing with bills on &quot;regional autonomy, the relationship of central and local government, formation, expansion and merger of regions, management of natural resources and other economic resources, and Bills related to the financial balance between the centre and the regions.&quot;

The International Foundation for Electoral Systems conducted a tracking survey in the Indonesian legislative elections in 2004 which showed that not all voters knew how to vote for candidates for the new Regional Representative Council, or were even aware of its existence. The first 128 elected DPD members were sworn in for the first time on 1 October 2004.

The DPD is not a true upper house, because the power of the DPD is relatively weak compared to the older chamber, the DPR, notably, it has no direct law-making or the power to veto bills. According to Indonesian constitutional scholar Jimly Asshiddiqie, the relative weakness of the DPD was a result of a compromise in the committee responsible for the constitutional amendment. The reformist faction wanted a strong second chamber in addition to the existing DPR to strengthen checks and balances, but the conservative faction opposed this.

== Membership ==
Article 22C of the Constitution says that all members of the DPD are elected through the same legislative election every five years, along with the members of the House of Representatives. The total number of senators is limited so that it does not exceed one-third of that of DPR. Each of the 38 provinces of Indonesia elect 4 members to the DPD, for a total of 152. At the inaugural 2004 legislative election, there were 32 provinces resulting in 128 senators, but as new provinces have been created the number of senators has been increased in subsequent elections. The number of senators were 132 starting in 2009, 136 starting in 2014, and 152 starting in 2024.

Senators are elected on a non-partisan basis using single non-transferable voting. However, many candidates in the 2004 election had links to the parties represented in the House of Representatives, the &quot;Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat&quot; or DPR. The senators elected to the Council represent the interests of their provinces, therefore the DPD can be seen as a reform of the &quot;utusan daerah&quot; (regional representatives) of the MPR during the Suharto era, which was appointed to the MPR at the president&#x27;s discretion.

==Powers and structure==
The DPD can propose regional bills to the House of Representatives and its senators must be heard on any regional bill proposed by the said House.

<doc id="617991" wikidata="Q1754283" url="?curid=617991" title="Vickers Warwick">
<text>The Vickers Warwick was a British twin-engined bomber aircraft developed and operated during the Second World War that was primarily used in other roles. In line with the naming convention followed by other RAF heavy bombers of the era, it was named after a British city or town, in this case Warwick. The Warwick was the largest British twin-engined aircraft to see use during the Second World War.

The Warwick was designed and manufactured by Vickers-Armstrongs during the late 1930s. It was intended to serve as a larger counterpart to the Vickers Wellington bomber. The two aircraft share similar construction and design principles but development of the Warwick was delayed by a lack of suitable engines. Its first flight was on 13 August 1939 but delays to its intended powerplant and by the time adequate engines were available, it was obsolete.

The Warwick entered production during 1942 and squadron service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Barely a dozen aircraft were built as bombers. The type was used by RAF Transport Command as a transport, and by RAF Coastal Command as an air-sea rescue and maritime reconnaissance aircraft. The Warwick was also operated by the Polish Air Forces in exile in Great Britain and the South African Air Force. A civil operator, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), also operated a handful of transport Warwicks.

==Design and development==
===Origins===

In October 1932, the British industrial conglomerate Vickers-Armstrongs tendered for the Air Ministry Specification B.9/32, which called for the development of a twin-engined medium bomber. During late 1934, when the company was already developing their Type 271 to meet Specification B.9/32, Vickers received a draft requirement for a larger bomber. The draft specification developed into Air Ministry Specification B.1/35, which sought a twin-engined heavy strategic bomber. It was intended to make use of more powerful engines, of , that were being developed, to enable the bomber to be faster and carry a heavier bomb load than the earlier B.3/34. Among the requirements of Specification B.1/35 was a speed of no less than while flying at , a range of while carrying of bombs, and the engines were to be furnished with variable-pitch propellers.

It was designed in parallel with the smaller Wellington, both aircraft having been derived from the Vickers Type 271 design, developed for Specification B.9/32. By the end of July 1935, the Air Ministry was considering eight designs. These included Vicker&#x27;s proposal, the Type 284, powered by a pair of Bristol Hercules engines, which exceeded the specifications. Vickers received an order for a prototype on 7 October 1935, while the Air Ministry also ordered prototypes from Armstrong Whitworth (the AW.39, a development of the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley) and Handley Page (the HP.55). These alternative designs were cancelled before being built, as Handley Page and Armstrong Whitworth switched to work on newer specifications released for medium (P.13/36) and heavy (B.12/36) bombers.

===Changes and redesigns===
As Specification B.1/35 was to be a heavier complement to Specification B.9/32, it was initially thought that there would be no need for a mock-up. On 14 March 1936, in light of major design changes being submitted, production of a complete mock-up was authorised. Around the same time, it was decided to allocate the Vickers 284 type number to the project, while the redesigned B.9/32 (which would become the Wellington) became the Vickers 285. As a consequence of the relaxation of the restrictions imposed by the 1932 Geneva Disarmament Conference, the weight of the Vickers 284 and 285 expanded gradually, until the 285 approached the original specified weight for Specification B.1/35.

During 1936, Specification B.1/34 was modified to require the aircraft to carry more fuel and a heavier bombload. During January 1937, the Rolls-Royce Vulture liquid-cooled X engine was named as the alternative powerplant of the Vickers 284 and it was adopted in late 1938. The Vulture, which had also been intended for the rival Avro Manchester, was subsequently determined to be unlikely to be available in sufficient numbers for the Warwick, as well as being unreliable, and on 2 July 1937, an order for a second prototype was placed the Air Ministry as insurance against the failure of the Vulture.

The second prototype (&quot;L9704&quot;) was designed for the Napier Sabre engine but development was slow, and production capacity was urgently required for the Hawker Typhoon fighter. &quot;L9704&quot; was instead fitted with the Bristol Centaurus radial engine. Other aspects of the design proved troublesome, such as the gun turrets and official doubts over the geodetic airframe structure, the latter having been used on several previous designs by British aircraft designer Barnes Wallis.

In February 1939, development beyond the pair of prototypes was cancelled because of difficulties with the Vulture engine but this was reversed the following January. In late June 1939, following the completion of a high-level review and an update of programme data, work resumed. While Vickers chose to continue with the project, official doubts, over slow progress caused by work on the Wellington and the lack of suitable engines, led to a growing official expectation that the design would be surpassed by later aircraft.

===Into flight===
On 13 August 1939, the first prototype (serial &quot;K8178&quot;), powered by Vulture engines, made its first flight from Brooklands, with test pilot Joseph &quot;Mutt&quot; Summers at the controls but the test flight only lasted for a few minutes due to a failed carburettor linkage. The smaller Wellington had flown three years earlier and had already been in production for 18 months by then. When fully equipped, the calculated all-up weight of the first prototype was , almost double the weight given by Vickers in their initial tender for the design. Flight tests with the prototype revealed it to be slow, underpowered and unable to maintain altitude on one engine.

The second prototype flew on 5 April 1940 with Centaurus engines and incorporated improvements to its design, such as a re-designed elevator, to improve handling. There was a definite improvement in performance and it was claimed that the second prototype was faster than a Hawker Hurricane, at certain altitudes. While the Centaurus-powered prototype was more promising, development was at an early stage. In October 1939, it was proposed that it be redesigned as a four-engined aircraft, with either Rolls-Royce Merlin XX or Bristol Hercules HE7SM engines but after some study, the idea was discarded as it reduced range and payload.

Another proposal used the American Pratt &amp; Whitney Double Wasp radial engine. Performance projections showed similar performance to the Hercules III-powered Wellington but with a significantly greater payload and the engines were also available due to the cancellation of contracts previously placed by the French. The second prototype was converted to use the R-2800-S14A4-G engines and was flown in July 1941. The Double Wasp installation was inferior to the Centaurus but was ordered regardless.

On 3 January 1941, an initial production order was placed for 250 Warwicks, consisting of 150 Double Wasp-powered Mk.I aircraft and 100 Centaurus-powered Mk.IIs, with deliveries to commence in November that year. It was at this point that the proposed aircraft was officially named in accordance with the Air Ministry&#x27;s practice of naming bombers after British towns and cities and with Vickers using &#x27;W&#x27; as the initial letter to indicate the designs of Barnes Wallis.

===Production===
The large initial production contract came despite the need to resolve troubles with the Centaurus engine. The Double Wasp engine, with a three-bladed diameter Hamilton Standard propeller, became the usual powerplant. Due to the time it took for the Double Wasps to reach Vickers in Britain from Pratt &amp; Whitney in the U.S., delays were unavoidable. During 1941, the second prototype flight tested a modified tail to improved handling. The prototype was fitted with production engines and propellers however this revealed problems with engine ignition, which was resolved with a revised booster coil. The Warwick was subject to considerable study to keep it relevant to the rapidly changing circumstances of the conflict, and it was out of this process that a work towards standardised production was made.

Due to persistent engine shortages and a change in policy, only 16 of the planned 150 Warwick bombers were completed. Even as the first bomber was nearing completion at Weybridge, the type was failing to meet Air Staff requirements for bomber aircraft. Bombers were being expected to carry much greater bombloads further, and a decision had been made to re-equip RAF Bomber Command exclusively with a new generation of four-engine bombers. Just as the earlier, and now obsolescent Wellington was being relegated to secondary roles, the Warwick was used for general reconnaissance (long range anti-submarine patrols), air-sea rescue, operational crew training and as a transport, where its obsolescence wasn&#x27;t as much of a problem.

By January 1943, 57 Warwick Mk.Is had been completed, when it was decided that they would be used primarily as transports and air-sea rescue aircraft. During mid-1943, a Warwick Mk.I was converted to become the Warwick Mk.II prototype with the principal difference being the installation of Centaurus IV engines. 219 Warwick Mk.I aircraft were completed, with the last 95 of these fitted with R-2800-47 engines.

In 1942, an order for 14 Warwick transports, the &quot;Vickers 456&quot; Warwick C.Mk.I was made for British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), a civil operator. Operational requirements were for the carriage of mail, freight and passengers between Bathurst in South Africa and Cairo in Egypt, complementing BOAC&#x27;s flying boat operations between England and Bathurst. The order was met by converting existing B.Mk.Is, by removing military equipment, fairing over gun turret openings, adding cabin windows, a freight floor, long-range fuel tanks and exhaust stack flame dampers for night flights.

The Warwick used Barnes Wallis&#x27; geodetic airframe construction pioneered in the Wellesley. In this system, a network of intersecting structural members made from duralumin were covered by wired-on fabric. The load was distributed across the structure, providing great redundancy in the event of damage, at the expense of complexity of construction.

==Operational history==
The first production Warwick B Mk.I was delivered to the RAF for testing at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment, Boscombe Down on 3 July 1942. This first aircraft was lost when fabric panels on the wings came loose on 28 January 1942. The second production Warwick took its place in flying trials but on 18 February 1943, it too was destroyed, by a fire which began in the starboard engine.

Only 16 aircraft were delivered as bombers, as by this time more capable four-engined heavy bombers such as the Short Stirling and Handley Page Halifax were in service. Those Warwicks that were delivered in the bomber configuration saw little use as such, instead being used to investigate various kinds of equipment and technical matters, including navigational equipment, engine performance, role suitability, and air-dropped lifeboats. It soon became clear that the Warwick, with its spacious fuselage and long range, would be well suited to utility roles. In January 1943, the Air Staff decided that the Warwick would serve as the predominant aircraft for transport and air-sea rescue.

Early testing showed the Warwick to be under-powered and with severe handling problems, especially when flown on one engine. Stability and control trials commenced with the third production Warwick, which yielded acceptable handling during single engine operations when fitted with a triangular extension ahead of the fin. The Double Wasps fitted to early models were unreliable while later versions fitted with the Centaurus engine had better performance but the handling problems were never completely solved.

Warwick &quot;BV243&quot; was converted into a transport for trials. An additional 13 Mk.Is were converted on the production line as C Mk.I transports for BOAC. BOAC&#x27;s Warwicks were used briefly on its Middle East services before being transferred back to RAF Transport Command in 1944. One hundred similar aircraft were built for the RAF as Warwick C Mk.IIIs, and entered service with 525 Squadron in June 1944, with three more squadrons operating the Warwick III. They were mainly used in the Mediterranean theatre, as the vulnerability of the fabric skinning to high temperature and humidity stopped plans to operate the Warwick in the Far East, and remained in use until retired in 1946.

The remainder of the first batch of 250 Warwicks were used by RAF Coastal Command for anti-submarine reconnaissance. From 1943, Warwicks were fitted with the Mk.IA airborne lifeboat and used for air-sea rescue. The lifeboat, designed by yachtsman Uffa Fox, laden with supplies and powered by two motors, was aimed with a bomb-sight to be dropped under parachute near ditched air crew from an altitude of about . Warwicks were credited with rescuing crews from a wide variety of contemporary aircraft both in the English Channel and the North Sea.

Only 235 of the production order for 525 Warwick Mk.V were completed, most of which went directly into storage in 1944. In early 1945, some examples of this stored variant was issued to 179 Squadron, stationed at RAF St Eval. Four Warwick GR Mk.Vs crashed on test flights from Brooklands during the first half of 1945. The first of these was PN773 which suffered an engine failure on take-off on 2 January and was skilfully force-landed close to St Mary&#x27;s Church in Byfleet and was later repaired and flown again. A propeller blade from this 1945 accident survives in the Brooklands Museum collection. The Warwick Mk.V was also operated by 17 and 27 Squadrons of the South African Air Force.

<text>The purple-rumped sunbird (Leptocoma zeylonica) is a sunbird endemic to the Indian Subcontinent. Like other sunbirds, they are small in size, feeding mainly on nectar but sometimes take insects, particularly when feeding young. They can hover for short durations but usually perch to lap nectar from flowers. They build a hanging pouch nest made up of cobwebs, lichens and plant material. Males are contrastingly coloured but females are olive above and yellow to buff below. Males are easily distinguished from the purple sunbird by the light coloured underside while females can be told apart from males by their whitish throats.

==Description==

Purple-rumped sunbirds are tiny, at less than long. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations for nectar feeding. Purple-rumped sunbirds are sexually dimorphic. The males have a dark maroon upperside with a blue-green crown that glistens at some angles, bright green shoulder patch and violet/purple rump patch which is generally hidden under the wings. The underparts are whitish with dark throat, maroon breast band and purple/violet patch in the throat which is visible in some angles. The iris is generally reddish in color. In the Western Ghats, it can overlap in some areas with the crimson-backed sunbird but the male of that species has reddish upperparts, a broader breast band and generally darker eyes. The female has a white throat followed by yellowish breast. The upperside is olive or brownish. The uppertail coverts are black and a weak supercilium may be visible. The nominate subspecies from Sri Lanka has a more bluish violet throat whereas the Indian form &quot;flaviventris&quot; (two other proposed populations &quot;whistleri&quot; from Maddur in Karnataka and &quot;sola&quot; from Pondicherry are subsumed) has a more pinkish tinge.

Their call is &quot;ptsiee ptsit, ptsiee ptsswit&quot; or a sharp twittering &quot;tityou, titou, trrrtit, tityou...&quot;.

==Distribution==
The purple-rumped sunbird is a common resident breeder in southern India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. It is found in Gujarat to the west (possibly a recent expansion) and extending into Assam (Hailakandi) or Meghalaya in the east. Records from Myanmar are not certain. This species is found in a variety of habitats with trees, including scrub and cultivation and is usually absent from dense forest.

==Behaviour and ecology==

They breed through the year and may have two broods, but mainly during the monsoons. The nest is made up of fine plant fibres, cobwebs and is studded on the exterior with lichens, bark pieces, flying seeds and other materials. The nest is constructed by the female alone although the male may fly alongside her. The nest is lined with soft fibres such as from the fuzz covering the seeds of &quot;Calotropis&quot;. The nest is placed on the end of branch and the entrance usually faces a bush. Nests may sometimes be built close to buildings or under open porches. The female stays in the nest at night a couple of day before laying the eggs. The clutch consists of two eggs which are generally oval, pale greenish and white with spots and streaks, becoming more dense at the broad end. Sometimes, eggs may be plain grey without markings as well. When collecting cobwebs they are often seen at windows of homes, a time when they also sometimes end up tapping the window, possibly at their own reflection. The eggs are usually laid in the morning. The eggs are incubated by both the male and female. The incubation period varies from 14 to 16 days. The chicks fledge in about 17 days and continue to be fed by the male for a few days. Helpers, females or possibly juveniles from the previous brood may sometimes assist the parents in feeding the young. Old nests are sometimes reused. Cases of nests being parasitised by the grey-bellied cuckoo are known. In one case the cuckoo was fed by an adult sunbird as well as an adult common tailorbird.

They pollinate the flowers of many plant species such as &quot;Bruguiera&quot;, &quot;Woodfordia&quot;, &quot;Hamelia&quot; and &quot;Sterculia&quot;. They tend to perch while foraging for nectar and do not hover as much as the syntopic Loten&#x27;s sunbird. It has been noted that they maintain special scratching posts, where they get rid of pollen and nectar sticking to their head. When the flowers are too deep to probe, they sometimes pierce the base of the flower and rob the nectar, an action termed as &quot;nectar theft&quot; since the flower&#x27;s primary purpose of attracting pollinators is foiled. They sometimes visit open crop fields and take honeydew exuded by leafhoppers.

Sunbird may indulge in dew-bathing, or bathing by sliding over drops of rain collected on large leaves.

Like most birds they harbour specific protozoa species in their blood. A species &quot;Haemoproteus raymundi&quot; has been described from a specimen from Goa but the identification and taxonomic placement of this malaria-like protozoan is disputed.

<text>Charles-Jean-Melchior, Marquis de Vogüé (18 October 182910 November 1916) was a French archaeologist, diplomat, and member of the Académie française in seat 18.

== Biography ==
Born in Paris as the eldest son of Léonce de Vogüé, Melchior de Vogüé was schooled at the École spéciale militaire de Saint-Cyr and at the École Polytechnique. In 1849, he was attached to the French Embassy in St. Petersburg.

After his father&#x27;s arrest during the French coup of 1851, de Vogüé gave up diplomacy to focus on archaeology and history in Syria and Palestine. Named as a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1868, he continued to publish scholarly journal articles on churches in the Holy Land, the Temple of Jerusalem, and Central Syria.

He was a prominent agrarian and President of the Société des agriculteurs de France.

After the fall of the Second French Empire, President Adolphe Thiers appointed him as Ambassador of France to Constantinople in 1871, then to Vienna in 1875.

==Family==
Melchior de Vogüé was the father of 6 children, including Marthe de Vogüé.

He was the uncle of fellow academician Eugène-Melchior de Vogüé, who served concurrently for a few years in seat 39 from 1888. His grandson, Jean Alexandre Melchior de Vogüé, was married to the French writer and businesswoman Hélène Marie Henriette Jaunez.

<doc id="618005" wikidata="Q7444698" url="?curid=618005" title="Sector-Wide Approach">
<text>Sector-Wide Approach (SWAp) is an approach to international development that &quot;brings together governments, donors and other stakeholders within any sector. It is characterized by a set of operating principles rather than a specific package of policies or activities. The approach involves movement over time under government leadership towards broadening policy dialogue; developing a single sector policy (that addresses private and public sector issues) and a common realistic expenditure program; common monitoring arrangements; and more coordinated procedures for funding and procurement.&quot; (World Health Organization, World Health Report 2000).

SWAp&#x27;s are represented in the basic principles of programme-based approaches (PBAs), which must form 66% of aid from signatories to the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. While research in sectors, such as in agriculture, demonstrate improvements in process and dialogue there is a debate over whether these results are substantial enough to justify the investment. This concern has created a fatigue amongst certain policymakers. SWAp principles are also threatened by shifts in the source of international aid, with the growing importance of Brazil, China and NGOs such as the Gates Foundation.

== Criticisms ==
The problem of implementing the sector wide approaches (SWAPs) is the top-down policy, which is the most common cause of the aid ineffectiveness (aiding democracy abroad - Thomas Carothers)

=== SWAps in Agriculture ===
Specifically in agriculture SWAp has produced very limited increases in aid effectiveness. Problems include:
# narrow ownership;
# a failure to coordinate all relevant sector players;
# excessive emphasis on systems, processes and institutional capacity-building initiatives has made service delivery a secondary concern while turning SWAps into expensive experiments.
These problems are argued by researchers at the Overseas Development Institute to be caused by a variety of political, institutional and operational factors. 
* Political factors: SWAps sought to address aid management concerns (e.g. aid fragmentation and donor harmonisation), but this has created a donor-centred processes which often fails to involve the recipients. Furthermore, even if all parties are involved, ideological differences of policy priorities complicate the ability to create a combined approach based on consensus.
* Institutional factors: typically SWAps in the agricultural sector are managed by Ministries of Agriculture. However, in most countries, the ministries fail to mobilise other actors relevant to the agricultural sector and hence to a sector-wide approach. There is also a tendency for ministries of agriculture to adopt an interventionist approach to policy and resist influence from outside the ministry. 
* Operational factors: processes and systems are implemented without reference to &#x27;local realities&#x27;. This leads to a focus on systems development and institutional capacity-building and less on the actual services delivered.

<text>was a Japanese explorer of Central Asia.

==Biography==
He made three trips to Central Asia between 1902 and 1910, all financed by Count Otani. Although he travelled as a priest of the Jōdo Shinshū sect, he was suspected by British and Russian Intelligence of being an officer of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

Tachibana was instrumental in delivery of the part of Dunhuang manuscripts to Japan in 1912.

&quot;For more details of Tachibana&#x27;s expeditions, see Expeditions of Count Otani&quot;.

<doc id="618009" wikidata="Q464643" url="?curid=618009" title="Stabbing">
<text>A stabbing is penetration or rough contact with a sharp or pointed object at close range. &quot;Stab&quot; connotes purposeful action, as by an assassin or murderer, but it is also possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from slashing or cutting in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim&#x27;s body, rather than being drawn across it.

Stab wounds is the specific form of penetrating trauma to the skin that results from stabbing.
Stabbings have been common among gangs and in prisons because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective.
Stabbing has also been used in terrorism.

==Epidemiology==
In 2013, about 8 million stabbings occurred worldwide.

In the US in 2020, 9% of the 22,429 homicides involved a sharp instrument; of these a larger proportion of females used a sharp instrument (13%) versus males (8.2%).

==History==
Stabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to assassinate a number of distinguished historical figures, such as Second Caliph Umar and Roman dictator Julius Caesar and emperor Caligula.

In Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in ritual suicide is known as &quot;seppuku&quot; (more colloquially &quot;hara-kiri&quot;, literally &quot;belly-cutting&quot; since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a &quot;second&quot; who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.

==Mechanism==
The human skin has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a small kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the fuller, an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as &quot;blood grooves&quot;. The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, internal bleeding is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin&#x27;s elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.

Death from stabbing is caused by shock, severe blood loss, infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the heart and/or lungs.

==Medical treatment==

Although previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery laparotomy, it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable. In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indicating a serious injury. If the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, then laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.

==Autopsy examination==
When someone who has sustained a stab wound dies, the body is autopsied and the wound is inspected by a forensic pathologist. Such examination can yield valuable information about the weapon used to produce the injury. From the external appearance and internal findings, the pathologist will usually be able to offer opinion about the dimensions of the weapon including the width and minimum possible length of the blade. It is possible to determine whether the weapon was single edged or double edged.

Sometimes factors like the taper of the blade and movement of knife in the wound can also be determined. Bruises or abrasions may give information about the guard.

<doc id="618030" wikidata="Q17107747" url="?curid=618030" title="Herman (comic strip)">
<text>Herman is a comic strip written and drawn by Jim Unger. While the daily ran as a single panel with a typeset caption, it expanded every Sunday as a full multi-panel strip with balloons.

== Publication history ==
Unger&#x27;s brother Bob was a major influence on the &quot;Herman&quot; comic. &quot;Herman&quot; was syndicated from 1975 to 1992, when Unger retired, running for 18 years in 600 newspapers in 25 countries.

In 1990, &quot;Herman&quot; became the first newspaper cartoon syndicated in East Germany. Shortly afterward, Unger produced a new book, &quot;Herman: Over the Wall&quot;. He joked, &quot;Six months later the (Berlin) Wall came down; I think that&#x27;s what did it.&quot;

On 2 June 1997, &quot;Herman&quot; returned to syndication with a mix of classic strip reprints and occasional new material under the United Media umbrella. &quot;It gives me the opportunity to bring them up to date and to introduce Herman to a new generation,&quot; Unger said in the 31 May 1997, edition of the &quot;Detroit News&quot;. He did not expect to return to full-time cartooning but planned to add new material.

Unger died in 2012; reruns of &quot;Herman&quot; continue to run on Andrews McMeel Syndication&#x27;s GoComics website, via the Newspaper Enterprise Association.

==Characters and story==
The eponymous Herman is actually anybody within the confines of the strip—a man, a woman, a child, any animal or even an extraterrestrial. All characters are rendered in Unger&#x27;s unique style as hulking, figures with pronounced noses and jaws, and often sport comically understated facial expressions.

An earlier strip, &quot;Herman&quot;, created by Clyde Lamb, published from 1949 through 1966, had no relation to Unger&#x27;s strip.

==Themes==
While there is no apparent continuity to the daily panels, there are several recurring themes:
*Married life: Wife: &quot;What would you rate me as? A 10? 9? 8? 7? 6? 5? 4, 3? (pause) Not 2!&quot; Husband: &quot;Keep going.&quot;
*Bad cooking: A woman tells her husband, &quot;I made you a meat pie and the dog ate it,&quot; to which the husband replies, &quot;I&#x27;ll miss the dog.&quot;
*Strange neighbours: A television comes crashing through the wall. Outside, a man yells &quot;You missed!&quot;
*The elderly: &quot;There&#x27;s an elephant on TV, and Grandma&#x27;s throwing peanuts at it!&quot;
*Animals: One penguin to another. &quot;We&#x27;d have arrived earlier, but our iceberg hit a ship.&quot;
*Children in school: &quot;Don&#x27;t drag your fingernails on the chalkboard, Wilson,&quot; a teacher with shattered glasses and standing-up hair says.
*Intelligent babies: A man enters the baby&#x27;s room with a bottle. &quot;It&#x27;s about time! Another five minutes, and I&#x27;d have died of thirst!&quot;
*Restaurants: A waiter dumps the customer&#x27;s food on the tablecloth. &quot;Terribly sorry about this, but we&#x27;re short of plates.&quot;
*Life in prison: Two prisoners have been caught cutting the bars from their cell window. &quot;We found it quite stuffy in here, warden.&quot;
*Art: A painting depicts a single half-circle at the bottom of the canvas: &quot;This one&#x27;s called &#x27;Here Comes the Sun.&#x27;&quot;
*Hunting and fishing: A hunter with a rifle realizes he has just blown the landing gear off of an airborne 747.
*People with bizarre ailments or injuries: A man in the hospital has a surgical scar covering his torso&#x27;s perimeter. &quot;It took us a while to find your appendix,&quot; the doctor explains.
*Encounters with extraterrestrial life: A UFO has been pulled over for speeding. &quot;Ignorance of the law is no excuse, buddy!&quot;
*Ordinary people thrust into bizarre situations: A man on a modern-day park bench encounters a Viking, who asks &quot;Is the war still on?&quot;
*Being overweight: An overweight man stands on a bathroom scale, and asks his wife, &quot;What do you mean the needle&#x27;s broken off?&quot;
*Mispronounced words: A sheriff&#x27;s deputy brings the sheriff a cat. The sheriff says &quot;I said &#x27;Round up a POSSE!&#x27;.&quot;
*Courts: A judge does not know that the defendant he is speaking to is a plywood cutout. &quot;You have been found guilty of forgery.&quot;
*Strange inventions: A man has a giant showerhead over his house. &quot;I get a good deal on fire insurance.&quot;
*Medical: Doctor tells overweight patient &quot;Walk two miles per day, but not on Morning Glory Circle.&quot;

Several collections of the comic strip were printed.

==Awards==
Unger received the National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Newspaper Panel Cartoon Award for 1982 and 1987 for his work on the strip.

<text>Aonio Paleario (c. 1500July 3, 1570) was an Italian Christian termed a &quot;reformer&quot;.

==Life==
He was born about 1500 at Veroli, in the Roman Campagna. Other forms of his name are Antonio Della Paglia, A. Degli Pagliaricci.

In 1520 he went to Rome, where he entered the brilliant literary circle of Leo X. When Charles of Bourbon stormed Rome in 1527, Paleario went first to Perugia and then to Siena, where he settled as a teacher of Greek and Hebrew.

In 1536 his didactic poem in Latin hexameters, &quot;De immortalitate animarum&quot;, was published at Lyon. It is divided into three books, the first containing his proofs of the divine existence, and the remaining two the theological and philosophical arguments for immortality based on that postulate. The whole concludes with a rhetorical description of the occurrences of the Second Advent.

In 1542 the Inquisition made his tract &quot;Della Pienezza, sufficienza, et satisfazione della passione di Christo&quot;, or &quot;Libellus de morte Christi&quot; (The Benefit of Christ&#x27;s Death), the basis of a charge of heresy, from which, however, he successfully defended himself. In Siena he wrote his &quot;Actio in pontifices romanos et eorum asseclas&quot;, a vigorous indictment, in twenty testimonia, against what he now believed to be the fundamental error of the Roman Church in subordinating Scripture to tradition, as well as against various particular doctrines, such as that of purgatory; it was not, however, printed until after his death (Leipzig, 1606).

In 1546 he accepted a professorial chair at Lucca, which he exchanged in 1555 for that of Greek and Latin literature at Milan. Here about 1566 his enemies renewed their activity, and in 1567 he was formally accused by Fra Angelo, the inquisitor of Milan. He was tried at Rome, condemned to death in October 1569, and executed in July 1570.

==Works==

An edition of his works (&quot;Ant. Palearii Verulani Opera&quot;), including four books of &quot;Epistolae&quot; and twelve &quot;Orationes&quot; besides the &quot;De immortalitate&quot;, was published at Lyon in 1552; this was followed by two others, at Basel, and several after his death, the fullest being that of Amsterdam, 1696. A work, entitled &quot;Benefizio di Cristo&quot; (&quot;The Benefit of Christ&#x27;s Death&quot;), has been attributed to Paleario on insufficient grounds. Lives by Gurlitt (Hamburg, 1805); Young (2 vols., London, 1860); Bonnet (Paris, 1862).

Churchill Babington, vicar of Cockfield, Suffolk published an English translation of &quot;Benefizio di Cristo&quot; in 1855.

Aonio Paleario is the subject of a 2014 novel &quot;A Dream of Shadows&quot; by Diana M. DeLuca. This novel was awarded two first place awards by Reader Views annual literary contest n the categories of Spiritual Fiction and Best in the Rocky Mountain region 2014.

<doc id="618037" wikidata="Q751962" url="?curid=618037" title="Crimson-backed sunbird">
<text>The crimson-backed sunbird or small sunbird (Leptocoma minima) is a sunbird endemic to the Western Ghats of India. Like other sunbirds, they feed mainly on nectar although they take insects, especially to feed their young. They are tiny birds that are resident and are found in forests but are particularly attracted to gardens at the edge of the forest where people grow suitable flower-bearing plants. They usually perch while taking nectar.

==Description==
Crimson-backed sunbirds are tiny, even by sunbird standards, and are only 8 cm long. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations for nectar feeding.

The adult male is velvety red on the mantle and wing coverts and there is a broad red breast band. The crown is shiny green and there are pink-violet patches on the throat and rump. The underside from the breast below is yellowish. There is a black edge to the bib that separates the yellow of the underside. The larger purple-rumped sunbird can appear very similar but this sunbird has a darker maroon on the upper side while the flanks and vent are whitish. The eclipse plumage (non-breeding) of the male has more olive on the head and velvet red is restricted to the lower mantle and wing coverts. The female is olive-brown but the rump is distinctly red. They are attracted to flower-rich gardens at the edges of forests or plantations.

The calls include short &quot;chik&quot; calls and longer &quot;chee-chee-which-chee&quot;.

==Behaviour and ecology==

The crimson-backed sunbird is an endemic resident breeder in the Western Ghats of India. The peak nesting season is December to March, but has been known to nest in nearly all months of the year in the southern Western Ghats. Two eggs are laid in a suspended nest on a thin drooping branch of low tree, fern frond or shrub. Both the male and female take part in nest building with the interior mainly built by the female. The eggs are mainly incubated by the female but males may involve themselves in feeding the young. The incubation period is about 18–19 days.

These birds are important pollinators of some plant species.

Males establish and defend feeding territories on flower bearing shrubs and trees. Plants such as &quot;Helixanthera intermedia&quot; which had a lot of nectar were defended more vigorously. 
Being small birds they may be killed by attack from insects like praying mantises too.

Although resident in many areas, they may make altitudinal movements in response to rains. In some areas they move to the foothills during the monsoons and move to the higher regions after the rains.

<doc id="618044" wikidata="Q1474574" url="?curid=618044" title="Taṇhā">
<text> (from Pāli; ) is an important concept in Buddhism, referring to &quot;thirst, desire, longing, greed&quot;, either physical or mental. It is typically translated as craving, and is of three types: &quot;kāma-taṇhā&quot; (craving for sensual pleasures), &quot;bhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving for existence), and &quot;vibhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving for non-existence).

&quot;Taṇhā&quot; appears in the Four Noble Truths, wherein arises with, or exists together with, &quot;dukkha&quot; (dissatisfaction, &quot;standing unstable&quot;) and the cycle of repeated birth, becoming and death (&quot;saṃsāra&quot;).

In the Theravāda Abhidhamma teachings, &quot;taṇhā&quot; is equivalent to the mental factor &quot;lobha&quot; (attachment).

==Etymology and meaning==
&quot;Taṇhā&quot; is a Pali word, derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word &quot;tṛ́ṣṇā&quot; (तृष्णा), which originates from the Proto-Indo-Iranian , which is related to the root &quot;tarś-&quot; (thirst, desire, wish), ultimately descending from Proto-Indo-European &quot;*ters-&quot; (dry). 

The word has the following Indo-European cognates: Avestan &quot;taršna&quot; (thirst), Ancient Greek &quot;térsomai&quot; (to dry), Lithuanian &quot;troškimas&quot; (thirst, desire), Gothic &quot;þaursus&quot; (dry), Old High German &quot;durst&quot; (thirst), English &quot;thirst&quot;. The word appears numerous times in the Samhita layer of the Rigveda, dated to the 2nd millennium BCE, such as in hymns 1.7.11, 1.16.5, 3.9.3, 6.15.5, 7.3.4 and 10.91.7. It also appears in other Vedas, wherein the meaning of the word is &quot;thirst, thirsting for, longing for, craving for, desiring, eager greediness, and suffering from thirst&quot;.

==Relation to &quot;dukkha&quot;==
In the second of the Four Noble Truths, the Buddha identified as arising together with &quot;dukkha&quot; (unease, &quot;standing unstable&quot;).

&quot;Taṇhā&quot;, states Walpola Rahula, or &quot;thirst, desire, greed, craving&quot; is what manifests as suffering and rebirths. However, adds Rahula, it is not the first cause nor the only cause of &quot;dukkha&quot; or &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, because the origination of everything is relative and dependent on something else. The Pali canons of Buddhism assert other defilements and impurities (&quot;kilesā&quot;, &quot;sāsavā dhammā&quot;), in addition to taṇhā, as the cause of Dukkha. &quot;Taṇhā&quot; nevertheless, is always listed first, and considered the principal, all-pervading and &quot;the most palpable and immediate cause&quot; of &quot;dukkha&quot;, states Rahula.

&quot;Taṇhā&quot;, states Peter Harvey, is the key origin of &quot;dukkha&quot; in Buddhism. It reflects a mental state of craving. Greater the craving, more is the frustration because the world is always changing and innately unsatisfactory; craving also brings about pain through conflict and quarrels between individuals, which are all a state of &quot;dukkha&quot;. It is such &quot;taṇhā&quot; that leads to rebirth and endless &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, stated Buddha as the second reality, and it is marked by three types of craving: sensory, being or non-existence. In Buddhist philosophy, there are right view and wrong view. The wrong views, it ultimately traces to &quot;taṇhā&quot;, but it also asserts that &quot;ordinary right view&quot; such as giving and donations to monks, is also a form of clinging. The end of &quot;taṇhā&quot; occurs when the person has accepted the &quot;transcendent right view&quot; through the insight into impermanence and non-self.

Both appropriate and inappropriate tendencies, states Stephen Laumakis, are linked to the fires of &quot;taṇhā&quot;, and these produce fruits of &quot;kamma&quot; thereby rebirths. Quenching and blowing out these fires completely, is the path to final release from &quot;dukkha&quot; and &quot;saṃsāra&quot;, in Buddhism. The Pali texts, states David Webster, repeatedly recommend that one must destroy &quot;taṇhā&quot; completely, and this destruction is necessary for &quot;nirvāṇa&quot;.

 is also identified as the eighth link in the twelve links of dependent origination. In the context of the twelve links, the emphasis is on the types of craving &quot;that nourish the karmic potency that will produce the next lifetime.&quot;

==Types==
The Buddha identified three types of &quot;taṇhā&quot;:
* &quot;Kāma-taṇhā&quot; (sensual pleasures craving): craving for sense objects which provide pleasant feeling, or craving for sensory pleasures. Walpola Rahula states that &quot;taṇhā&quot; includes not only desire for sense-pleasures, wealth and power, but also &quot;desire for, and attachment to, ideas and ideals, views, opinions, theories, conceptions and beliefs (&quot;dhamma-taṇhā&quot;).&quot;
* &quot;Bhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving for being): craving to be something, to unite with an experience. This is ego-related, states Harvey, the seeking of certain identity and desire for certain type of rebirth eternally. Other scholars explain that this type of craving is driven by the wrong view of eternalism (eternal life) and about permanence.
* &quot;Vibhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving for non-existence): craving not to experience unpleasant things in the current or future life, such as unpleasant people or situations. This sort of craving may include attempts at suicide and self-annihilation, and this only results in further rebirth in a worse realm of existence. This type of craving, states Phra Thepyanmongkol, is driven by the wrong view of annihilationism, that there is no rebirth.

== Cessation of &quot;taṇhā&quot; ==
The third noble truth teaches that the cessation of &quot;&quot; is possible. The &quot;Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta&quot; states:
: Bhikkhus, there is a noble truth about the cessation of suffering. It is the complete fading away and cessation of this craving [&quot;taṇhā&quot;]; its abandonment and relinquishment; getting free from and being independent of it.

Cessation of can be obtained by following the Noble Eightfold Path. In Theravada Buddhism, the cessation results from the gaining of true insight into impermanence and non-self. The &#x27;insight meditation&#x27; practice of Buddhism, states Kevin Trainor, focuses on gaining &quot;right mindfulness&quot; which entails understanding three marks of existence - &quot;dukkha&quot; (suffering), &quot;anicca&quot; (impermanence) and &quot;anatta&quot; (non-self). The understanding of the reality of non-self, adds Trainor, promotes non-attachment because &quot;if there is no soul, then there is no locus for clinging&quot;. Once one comprehends and accepts the non-self doctrine, there are no more desires, i.e. &quot;taṇhā&quot; ceases.

==&quot;Taṇhā&quot; versus &quot;chanda&quot;==
Buddhism categorizes desires as either &quot;taṇhā&quot; or &quot;chanda&quot;. &quot;Chanda&quot; literally means &quot;impulse, excitement, will, desire for&quot;.

Bahm states that &quot;chanda&quot; is &quot;desiring what, and no more than, will be attained&quot;, while &quot;taṇhā&quot; is &quot;desiring more than will be attained&quot;. However, in early Buddhist texts, adds Bahm, the term &quot;chanda&quot; includes anxieties and is ambiguous, wherein five kinds of &quot;chanda&quot; are described, namely &quot;to seek, to gain, to hoard, to spend and to enjoy&quot;. In these early texts, the sense of the word &quot;chanda&quot; is the same as &quot;taṇhā&quot;.

Some writers such as Ajahn Sucitto explain &quot;chanda&quot; as positive and non-pathological, asserting it to be distinct from negative and pathological &quot;taṇhā&quot;. Sucitto explains it with examples such as the desire to apply oneself to a positive action such as meditation. In contrast, Rhys Davids and Stede state that &quot;chanda&quot;, in Buddhist texts, has both positive and negative connotations; as a vice, for example, the Pali texts associate &quot;chanda&quot; with &quot;lust, delight in the body&quot; stating it to be a source of misery.

&quot;Chanda&quot;, states Peter Harvey, can be either wholesome or unwholesome.

==Relation to the three poisons==
 (desire) can be related to the three poisons:
* &quot;Avijjā (avidyā)&quot; or &quot;moha&quot; (ignorance), the root of the three poisons, is also the basis for &quot;taṇhā&quot;.
* &quot;Rāga&quot; (attachment) is equivalent to &quot;bhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving to be) and &quot;kāma-taṇhā&quot; (sense-craving).
* &quot;Dosa (dveṣa)&quot; (aversion) is equivalent to &quot;vibhava-taṇhā&quot; (craving not to be).

According to Rupert Gethin, &quot;taṇhā&quot; is related to aversion and ignorance. Craving leads to aversion, anger, cruelty and violence, states Gethin, which are unpleasant states and cause suffering to one who craves. Craving is based on misjudgement, states Gethin, that the world is permanent, unchanging, stable, and reliable. 

For example, in the first discourse of the Buddha, the Buddha identified &quot;taṇhā&quot; as the principal cause of suffering. However, his third discourse, the &quot;Fire Sermon&quot;, and other suttas, the Buddha identifies the causes of suffering as the &quot;fires&quot; of &quot;rāga&quot;, &quot;dosa&quot; (&quot;dveṣa&quot;), and &quot;moha&quot;; in the &quot;Fire Sermon&quot;, the Buddha states that &quot;nirvāṇa&quot; is obtained by extinguishing these fires.

<doc id="618046" wikidata="Q706575" url="?curid=618046" title="E-Rotic">
<text>E-Rotic is a Eurodance duo act formed in 1994 by German record producer David Brandes. The act is best known in Europe for the hits &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot; and &quot;Fred Come to Bed&quot;. E-Rotic originally consisted of German born singer Lyane Leigh (real name Liane Hegemann) and American rapper Richard Allen Smith (a.k.a. Ras-Ma-Taz). The act is known for its extensive use of sexual themes in its songs and music videos.

==Band history==

===1994–95: Formation and &quot;Sex Affairs&quot;===
Brandes knew Leigh from their Xanadu days, active from 1989 to 1992, where they were both members and one half of the group. In 1994, Brandes released a solo song &quot;Helpless Dancer&quot; with Leigh on guest vocals, before American-born Ras-Ma-Taz joined them to create E-Rotic. Together they scored the charts with their first three chart topping singles &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot;, which peaked #45 in the UK Singles Chart and #4 in the Dutch Single Chart, &quot;Fred Come to Bed&quot;, #3 in the German Single Chart, and &quot;Sex on the Phone&quot;, #2 in Austria, followed by their debut studio album &quot;Sex Affairs&quot;. Next to E-Rotic, Brandes continued, forming other dance projects, such as Apanachee in 1995 with Lydia Madajewski on vocals, who would later also become E-Rotic&#x27;s studio lead singer in 2000.
===1996–1997: &quot;The Power of Sex&quot;, &quot;Sexual Madness&quot; and departure of Raz-Ma-Taz===
After the fourth single release &quot;Willy Use a Billy... Boy&quot;, released in 1995 and peaked #5 in Austria, later in November 1995, both members left the band, due to a disagreement between Leigh and producer Brandes, who were quickly replaced by artists Jeane (Jeanette Macchi-Meier) and briefly Terence D&#x27;Arby (not to be confused with Terence Trent D&#x27;Arby), who himself again was replaced by Ché Jouaner. Thus it has been later revealed, that Brandes was the rapper on all E-Rotic releases, except on the first album, where he shared raps with Raz-Ma-Taz, such on &quot;Take My Love&quot;, and Leigh still had to continue to provide vocal work for E-Rotic&#x27;s four follow up studio albums &quot;The Power of Sex&quot;, &quot;Sexual Madness&quot;, the Abba cover album &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; until 1999 to the Kiss Me studio album due to her contract. Also, raps on their first single &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot; were not done by Smith or Brandes, but instead were done by Marcus Thomas (aka Deon Blue) who would later join Pharao. Meanwhile, Leigh, and Ras-Ma-Taz, formed their own band S.E.X. Appeal in 1996. &quot;He promised me a lot of things during my E-Rotic time, but never was willing to keep his promises. One of these promises was to produce a mixed video, with both cartoon and real people. We were never shown in the videos and so we had problems with our concerts, cause no-one really knew us as persons,&quot; Leigh revealed. On 27 June 1996, the group&#x27;s second studio album &quot;The Power of Sex&quot; was released, preceded by the latter mentioned lead single &quot;Willy Use a Billy... Boy&quot; and followed by the singles &quot;Help Me Dr. Dick&quot;, &quot;Fritz Love My Tits&quot; and &quot;Gimme Good Sex&quot;, all becoming moderate chart hits, peaking at #18, #16 and #3 in Austria respectively. In 1996, E-Rotic were featured in the supergroup, called &quot;Love Message&quot;, on the same titled, Masterboy-produced charity single &quot;Love Message&quot;. They also appeared on the Queen tribute compilation album &quot;Queen Dance Traxx&quot;, with the song &quot;Who Wants to Live Forever&quot;, which also saw a promotional release. The tribute album also featured another Queen song &quot;We Are The Champions&quot;, recorded with all artists, who participated on &quot;Queen Dance Traxx&quot; as a supergroup labeled as &quot;Acts United&quot;. In 1997, the studio albums &quot;Sexual Madness&quot; and the ABBA cover CD &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; was released with its single releases &quot;Turn Me On&quot;, which peaked at #7 in Finland, &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; and &quot;The Winner Takes It All&quot;. The album &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; was released under the artist name &quot;Jenn and C.&quot; in France. Ironically the music video for &quot;Gimme Good Sex&quot; was also the first one, not being a comic video, but still it never aired and was banned from music channels because of being too controversial for its sexual content, thus Leigh, alongside Ras-Ma-Taz, left the band earlier, because she wanted to be shown in music videos.

===1998–1999: &quot;Greatest Tits&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and departure of Leigh===
In 1998, E-Rotic have released their first Greatest Hits compilation album titled &quot;Greatest Tits - The Best of E-Rotic&quot;, along with the single &quot;Baby Please Me&quot; and the megamix &quot;Die geilste Single der Welt&quot; (German for &quot;The Horniest Single in the World&quot;) to promote the album in Germany. In 1999, their second and final single from &quot;Sexual Madness&quot;, called &quot;Don&#x27;t Say We&#x27;re Through&quot;, was released and later E-Rotic tried to enter the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 representing Germany but ended in sixth place in the pre-selection with the single &quot;Queen of Light&quot;. This was the only time, where Macchi-Meier had to perform and sing live, when she was always lip syncing Leigh&#x27;s and later Madajewski&#x27;s singing parts on live shows. The song was later added on E-Rotic&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot; and on Missing Hearts debut studio album &quot;Mystery&quot; (labeled as Missing Heart), in 2000. After that, E-Rotic focused more on the Japanese music market, where they kept more popular when the interest in Eurodance music in Europe waned at the end of the 1990s. In 1999, the fifth studio album &quot;Kiss Me&quot; was released in Japan with the three singles &quot;Oh Nick Please Not So Quick&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;Mambo No. Sex&quot;, which all failed to chart. The latter mentioned single, was released on the later released German edition of &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, retitled &quot;Mambo No. Sex&quot; with a different track list and cover art leaned on the success of Lou Bega&#x27;s &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot; at that time. The release of &quot;Kiss Me&quot;/&quot;Mambo No. Sex&quot; also marks the final with Leigh on vocals, who were replaced by Madajewski later in 2000.

===2000–2001: &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot;, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and &quot;Sex Generation&quot;===
Between 2000 and 2001, three studio albums had been released in Japan, titled &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot;, &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; and &quot;Sex Generation&quot; with the singles &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot;, &quot;Missing You&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Wet&quot;, &quot;L.O.V.E. (Sex on the Beach)&quot;, &quot;Billy Jive (With Willy&#x27;s Wife)&quot; and &quot;King Kong&quot;, all with limited success. Also the two compilation albums, titled &quot;Dancemania Presents E-Rotic Megamix&quot;, a megamix, and &quot;The Very Best of E-Rotic&quot; was released in Japan respectively. The albums &quot;Sex Generation&quot; and &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot; were also released in Europe, with the latter retitled &quot;Missing You&quot; with the same track list, except replacing the song &quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot; with the title track &quot;Missing You&quot;. Macchi-Meier left E-Rotic in 2001, briefly replaced by the next stage performer Yasemin Baysal, previously of the group Das Modul.

===2002–2003: &quot;Cocktail E-Rotic&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;===
However, Baysal and Jouaner left E-Rotic in 2002, and instead of replacing her with a new stage performer, this time the real studio singer Lydia Madajewski (Lydia Pockaj), who had been providing vocals since Leigh&#x27;s departure in 1999, had been introduced to face E-Rotic. She has been joined by the stage performer Robert Spehar. In 2002, they released the group&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Cocktail E-Rotic&quot;, the third compilation album titled &quot;The Collection&quot; and in 2003, the remix album &quot;Total Recall&quot;, all in Japan. The remix album has also been released in European territories with a different track list including new mixes. In 2002 a promotional single &quot;Mi Amante&quot; (Spanish for &quot;My Lover&quot;) was released, labeled as e.R. In 2003, a new version of their very first single &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot; (2003 Dance Mix) was released to promote the remix album &quot;Total Recall&quot;. &quot;Cocktail E-Rotic&quot; saw one promotional single release, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;, which gained some radio airplay in Japan and ranked #1 on a Japanese radio chart. After that, E-Rotic went on an indefinite hiatus and both members, Madajewski and Spehar, left the band.

===2004–2013: Hiatus===
Most former band members retired from the music scene. Brandes continued to produce for other artists and even reused dozen of E-Rotic songs for the Japanese girlgroup Shanadoo for their albums &quot;Welcome to Tokyo&quot; and &quot;The Symbol&quot;. Shanadoo project discontinued in 2014. Leigh continues her solo project S.E.X. Appeal. In 2006, an upcoming studio album, entitled &quot;Lust 4 Life&quot; (refers to the Fancy solo song title &quot;D.I.S.C.O. (Lust for Life)&quot;, recorded back in 1999 with Leigh on guest vocals), was rumored and turned out to be false. Also in 2008, it had been rumored, that E-Rotic would release a new track, a cover of Vanilla Ninja&#x27;s track &quot;Liar&quot;, which was also produced by Brandes.

===2014–present: Return of Leigh, &quot;Level Up&quot; and &quot;The Hits&quot;===
In December 2014, original E-Rotic lead singer Leigh confirmed that E-Rotic would come back and that she would return as the vocalist of the group again alongside a new rapper, Stephen Appleton. She also confirmed that E-Rotic planned to release a new best of album with re-recorded past hits and brand new E-Rotic songs to be released sometime in 2015. The group would be managed and produced by Icezone Music. The official website appeared to be under maintenance and a new official Facebook page was launched.

On 4 March 2016, E-Rotic released the single &quot;Video Starlet&quot;, which included another song called &quot;Murder Me&quot;.

On 20 September 2024, E-Rotic released their first studio album in over twenty years, &quot;Level Up&quot;. It was supported by the singles &quot;Murder Me &#x27;21&quot;, &quot;Head Over Heels&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;My Heart is Ticking Like a Bomb&quot;, &quot;You Hooked Me Up&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Get It Started&quot;, and &quot;Out of My Life&quot;. Simultaneously, the group also released &quot;The Hits&quot;, a compilation album of their most notable songs spanning their entire history, including a re-recorded version of &quot;Sex On The Phone&quot;.

==Artistry==

===Music===
E-Rotic&#x27;s music is a mix of dance and pop music with eurodance, which was very famous and popular in Europe, Oceania and South America at that time. The style of eurodance was dance music with a female singer and a male rapper to follow a traditional verse-chorus structure. Through the fact, that Brandes produced several dance projects with Leigh and Madajewski on vocals, such as Missing Heart, Apanachee or IQ-Check, their sound led to be very similar and reminiscent to E-Rotic&#x27;s sound. Also, Leigh&#x27;s early eurodance works with her project S.E.X. Appeal, then with rapper Raz-Ma-Taz, such as &quot;Sex is a Thrill with the Pill&quot;, were very reminiscent of E-Rotic&#x27;s sexual topics, music videos, lyrics and sound. That&#x27;s also a reason, why some songs have been released with the same cast but under different stage names, such as &quot;Helpless Dancer&quot; (labeled as just David Brandes feat. Lyane Leigh), &quot;Gotta Get It Groovin&#x27;&quot; as IQ-Check (Brandes &amp; Leigh), &quot;Queen of Light&quot; as E-Rotic but also as Missing Heart (Brandes &amp; Madajewski) or &quot;Mi Amante&quot; as e.R. (Brandes &amp; Madajewski). In particular, the album &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; was released under the artist name &quot;Jenn and C.&quot; in France. For events, promotion and cover arts, also Leigh often credits her project as &quot;S.E.X. Appeal (EX) E-Rotic&quot; for a better recognition. E-Rotic are best known for Eurodance tracks like &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot;, &quot;Fred Come to Bed&quot; and &quot;Sex on the Phone&quot;. Although there are also tracks from other genres featured, such as ballads like &quot;Wild Love&quot;, &quot;Final Heartbreak&quot; or &quot;The Power of Sex&quot; and reggae fusion inspired tracks like &quot;Come on Make Love to Me&quot;, &quot;Help Me Dr. Dick&quot; or &quot;Gimme Good Sex&quot; and the Mambo/Jive-driven &quot;Mambo No. Sex&quot;. These tracks do not belong to the Europop genre.

===Public image===
E-Rotic are known for a tendency to make thought-provoking cartoon-animated music videos, which would air on VIVA Germany, and comic cover arts that fit the songs they represent. Due to the controversial disagreement between Leigh, who wanted to be shown in music videos, and producer Brandes, E-Rotic ironically later made some live action video clips and cover arts, such as the music videos for &quot;Gimme Good Sex&quot;, &quot;The Winner Takes it All&quot; or &quot;Kiss Me&quot; and covers for the &quot;Thank You for the Music&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me&quot;/&quot;Gimme, Gimme, Gimme&quot; eras. However, for later releases like &quot;Sexual Healing&quot;, &quot;Sex Generation&quot; and &quot;Cocktail E-Rotic&quot;, they returned to all full comic music videos and cover arts. E-Rotic are also well known for having rhyming song titles about particular people like Max, Fred, Fritz, Sam or Willy on &quot;Max Don&#x27;t Have Sex With Your Ex&quot;, &quot;Fred Come to Bed&quot;, &quot;Willy Use a Billy... Boy&quot;, &quot;Fritz Love My Tits&quot;, &quot;Oh Nick Please Not So Quick&quot;, &quot;Molly Dolly (Loves Her Lolly)&quot;, &quot;Ralph, Don&#x27;t Make Love by Yourself&quot;, &quot;Veejay the DJ&quot;, &quot;Test My Best&quot;, &quot;Rave Me Dave&quot;, &quot;Gimme Your Jimmy&quot; or &quot;Billy Jive (With Willy&#x27;s Wife)&quot;. Because of the full comic arts in music videos and CD releases, the members were barely recognized. The band has been presented by numerous of stage performers, the four singers Lyane Leigh, Jeane, Yasemin Baysal and Lydia Madajewski and the seven rappers Raz-Ma Taz, Terence D&#x27;Arby, Ché Jouaner, Robert Spehar, Stephen Appleton, James Allan and Ricardo Brownn (not to be confused with Kurupt). However, Brandes later revealed and confirmed that the only two studio singers were Leigh and Madajewski, and the only rappers were actually himself, occasionally alongside Raz-Ma-Taz or Deon Blue.

<doc id="618055" wikidata="Q2403702" url="?curid=618055" title="RMS Caronia (1947)">
<text>RMS &quot;Caronia&quot; was a passenger ship of the Cunard Line (then Cunard White Star Line). Launched on 30 October 1947, she served with Cunard until 1967. She was nicknamed the &quot;Green Goddess&quot; after her light green hull livery. She was one of the first &quot;dual-purpose&quot; ships, built both for 2-class transatlantic crossings and all 1st-class cruising. After leaving Cunard she was briefly &quot;Caribia&quot; in 1969, after which she was laid up in New York until 1974, when she was sold for scrap. While being towed to Taiwan for scrapping, she was caught in a storm on 12 August. After her tow lines were cut, she repeatedly crashed on the rocky breakwater outside Apra Harbor, Guam and broke into three sections.

==History==
After World War II, the Cunard White Star Line operated three ships on the Southampton—New York run. The famous RMS &quot;Queen Mary&quot; and RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; operated a weekly express service between Southampton and New York. The smaller and slower RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; served as an auxiliary ship on this route in addition to performing seasonal cruises out of New York City. The company placed an order for a running mate to &quot;Mauretania&quot;, a ship of similar speed and proportions for the transatlantic run. Ultimately this was not to be the role of the new ship, as Cunard White Star&#x27;s executives decided that the new ship would be built primarily for cruising.

With this in mind, the new ship – soon to be named &quot;Caronia&quot; by Princess Elizabeth – received many different features from her Cunard White Star fleetmates. Amenities included an outdoor swimming pool as well as bathroom / shower facilities in every cabin. However, unlike modern cruise ships, her accommodation was divided into two classes on transatlantic voyages; First and Cabin.

On cruises all accommodation was sold as one class although many staterooms, both on A deck and R deck, were usually allocated to Cabin Class. Even some cabins on B deck were sold on cruises. Both restaurants served the same menu in just one sitting and passengers were allocated to a restaurant dependent upon the locations of their staterooms. On short cruises to the Caribbean and South America, every cabin was offered for occupation and often, as on transatlantic crossings, there would be two sittings for luncheon and dinner.

To distinguish her from Cunard White Star&#x27;s express liners, the company decided to give her a different colour scheme. Instead of going for the then typical black hull with a white superstructure, &quot;Caronia&quot; received a unique livery of four different shades of &quot;Cruising Green&quot;, making her a highly attractive and instantly recognizable vessel.

Another striking feature of the ship was her large single funnel, one of the largest ever installed aboard a ship. Similar to those of the later , this funnel easily caught the wind, making the ship somewhat difficult to handle. &quot;Caronia&quot; was the largest passenger ship to be built in Scotland after World War 2 until &quot;Queen Elizabeth 2&quot; twenty years later.

Clara MacBeth lived full-time on &quot;Caronia&quot; between 1949 and 1963, a span of 14 years.

===1949–1959: a ship ahead of her time===

The brand-new RMS &quot;Caronia&quot; commenced her maiden voyage on 4 January 1949 between Southampton and New York. Two more transatlantic crossings followed before the ship embarked on her first cruises from New York to the Caribbean. During her first years she spent most of the year on transatlantic crossings; only during the winter was she engaged in cruising. In 1951 she made her first world cruise. From 1952 onwards she made transatlantic crossings only in August and September, with the rest of the year dedicated to cruising; during one such cruise, she ran aground in Egypt on 12 March 1952 while transiting the Suez Canal. In May 1953 &quot;Caronia&quot; made what was perhaps her most famous cruise, associated with the coronation ceremony of Queen Elizabeth II (who had christened &quot;Caronia&quot; six years earlier). The ship was used as a hotel, as most of the accommodation in the United Kingdom was fully booked.

&quot;Caronia&quot; ran aground at Messina, Sicily, Italy, on 31 May 1956, but was refloated the next day. Her annual refit in November 1956 saw &quot;Caronia&quot; modernised for southern cruising with air-conditioning outfitted through the entire ship. Her world cruise of 1958 saw her suffer the most serious accident of her career. Sailing slowly out of Yokohama harbour to avoid collision with a United States Navy vessel, she was driven by high winds against the harbor&#x27;s breakwater, causing serious damage to her bow and demolishing a harbor lighthouse in the process. The United States Navy allowed Cunard to use their drydock at the Yokosuka yard for repairs to &quot;Caronia&quot;. That same year &quot;Caronia&quot;″s autumn cruise in the Mediterranean had to be cancelled due to political tensions in the Middle East.

===1959-1967: Competition catches up===
1959 saw &quot;Caronia&quot; making regular transatlantic crossings for the last time. Competition from the jet airliner meant there weren&#x27;t enough passengers for her in the North Atlantic trade. From here her transatlantic crossings were repositioning voyages. The first each year being a &quot;Sterling Cruise&quot;, so called because all other &quot;Caronia&quot; cruises were paid for only in US dollars, and taking a southerly route via the Bahamas instead of the usual direct route. Decreased passenger numbers in the North Atlantic also meant that more of Cunard&#x27;s liners were rebuilt into cruise use and received a similar green colour scheme to that of &quot;Caronia&quot;, which in 1962 were established as the line&#x27;s official cruise colours when RMS &quot;Mauretania&quot; was repainted for cruising (though not otherwise significantly adapted for the role). In 1963 the heavily rebuilt and renamed RMS &quot;Franconia&quot; and &quot;Carmania&quot; followed suit. By this time &quot;Caronia&#x27;s&quot; itineraries had settled into a yearly pattern, each cruise having found its ideal individual place in the calendar.

By the early 1960s other shipping companies were catching up with Cunard and building their own purpose-built cruiseships, which in addition to being better equipped than &quot;Caronia&quot; were better suited for cruising than she had ever been. To keep up with her newer competitors, Cunard decided that in November 1965 &quot;Caronia&quot; would be drydocked for ten weeks, new suites and a lido deck built, and her interior brought up to date. 1966 brought with it a seamen&#x27;s strike in Britain, which upset &quot;Caronia&#x27;s&quot; itineraries badly. As a result of climbing operating costs, 1967 was the first year when &quot;Caronia&quot; didn&#x27;t profit her owners. Due to increased competition, Cunard decided to withdraw her from service at the end of the year. Fittingly, &quot;Caronia&#x27;s&quot; last voyage for Cunard was a transatlantic crossing from New York to Southampton.

===1968–1974: final years===

In early 1968 &quot;Caronia&quot; was sold to Star Shipping, a company owned by US and Panamian interests. Renamed &quot;Columbia&quot;, she sailed to Greece for refitting. Cunard had allowed &quot;Caronia&quot; to fall behind her maintenance schedule, and her engines needed a major overhaul. Replacement parts were ordered from a Greek company rather than from the original manufacturer. While she was being rebuilt Andrew Konstaninidis took control of &quot;Columbia&quot;, buying out the other owners of Star Line and renaming her &quot;Caribia&quot;. Her refitting was completed and she was given a new all-white colour scheme. She was registered in Panama, with her tonnage reduced to 25,794 GRT under Panamanian rules (which saved dock dues). In February 1969 &quot;Caribia&quot; embarked on her first cruise from New York to the Caribbean. The voyage was hindered by a malfunction in her waste system. Things turned for the worse on her second cruise, when an explosion in the engine room resulted in the death of one crew member and the severe scalding of another. In addition the ship lost all electrical power for twenty hours before repairs allowed her to return to port. The incident undermined public confidence in the vessel. &quot;Caribia&quot; limped back to New York, never to make a commercial voyage again.

Plans to revive &quot;Caribia&quot; were considered for the next five years, but she remained docked in New York and her berthing debts continued to accumulate. Finally in July 1974 her owners gave in and sold the once great ship for scrap. German ocean tug &quot;Hamburg&quot; was entrusted with the task of towing &quot;Caribia&quot; to a breaker&#x27;s yard in Taiwan. Whilst near Honolulu the ship was in danger of capsizing; but repairs were made and they continued on. The two ships sailed into Typhoon Mary near Guam. On August 12, 1974, &quot;Hamburg&quot;″s generators failed and her crew were forced to cut &quot;Caribia&quot; loose to save their own vessel. The storm&#x27;s winds drove the lifeless ship against Apra Harbour&#x27;s breakwater, where she was wrecked.

Being a hazard to local shipping, the wreck was swiftly cut up. However, before that could take place, it was discovered that the &quot;Caribia&quot; had come to rest beside the wreck of a Korean War-era landing craft. The landing craft was loaded with tons of munitions, including 22 mm, 40 mm, 5-inch, and 8-inch shells. This required the careful removal of all of these materials over five months before removal of &quot;Caribia&quot; could continue. Her removal was all the more urgent because &quot;Caribia&quot;″s hulk blocked Apra harbor&#x27;s entrance. As Apra is the only deep-water harbor on Guam, this made resupply of many vital commodities (e.g., petroleum products) impossible or difficult. No commercial or military vessels could leave or enter the harbor until a significant portion of the stern had been removed. By January 1975, most of &quot;Cariba&quot;″s stern had been removed, restoring access to and from the harbor. Afterwards, scrapping continued onto her bow section. What was left of the wreck had been removed by late 1975. Her life ended just 25 years after she was commissioned. Despite being probably the most forward-looking ship of her time, &quot;Caronia&quot; was in active service for only 19 years.

<text>The crimson sunbird (Aethopyga siparaja) is a species of bird in the sunbird family which feed largely on nectar. They may also take insects, especially when feeding their young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed. It is the unofficial national bird of Singapore, as declared by the Nature Society Singapore.

==Description==
Crimson sunbirds are tiny, only 11 cm long. They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to their nectar feeding. The adult male has a crimson breast and maroon back, with black malar stripes. The rump is yellow and the belly is olive. The female has an olive-green back, yellowish breast and white tips to the outer tail feathers. In most of the range, males have a long green-blue tail, but &quot;A.s. nicobarica&quot; of the Nicobar Islands and the former subspecies &quot;A. vigorsii&quot; (Western crimson sunbird) of the Western Ghats of India lack the long central tail feathers. Their call is &quot;chee-cheewee&quot;.

==Distribution and habitats==
The crimson sunbird is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from India, through Nepal, Bangladesh and Myanmar to Indonesia and Brunei. Two or three eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. This species occurs in forest and cultivated areas.

<text>Chris Liebing (born Christopher Liebing; 11 December 1968) is a German techno DJ, music producer and radio host and the founder of the record label CLR.

== Biography ==
Liebing was born in Gießen, Hesse. In the early 1990, he became active on the Frankfurt dance music scene. He opened the Spinclub techno club in 1994, and worked at Eye Q Records in Frankfurt. He formed his first label, &#x27;Audio&#x27; in 1996, which was followed in 1999 by CLR.

In 2004, he released the philosophy-themed &quot;Evolution&quot;, which took two years to make. The album was described by &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; as &quot;a techno album to go to war with&quot;.

In 2005, he worked with Speedy J on the &quot;Collabs 3000: Metalism&quot; album, released by Novamute. The album was described by &quot;Billboard&quot; as &quot;one of the year&#x27;s best collections of original electronic music&quot;.

In 2009, he launched the CLR Podcast, which was made available every Monday via iTunes and CLR&#x27;s own website. The podcast was voiced by Liebing and featured guest mixes from a wide variety of techno DJs. Amongst the more notable guests was Depeche Mode&#x27;s Martin Gore. The podcast ran weekly until 2015 when the 315th and final episode was broadcast. It was replaced by a new weekly podcast entitled am/fm, which features only mixes and live recordings by Chris Liebing himself.

Liebing has played at Space and Amnesia in Ibiza, Fabric in London, Berghain in Berlin, Cocoricò in Riccione and large festivals such as Time Warp. In 2018, Liebing launched his first album in eight years: &quot;Burn Slow&quot; on Mute Records. The album included vocal contributions from artists such as Gary Numan and Polly Scattergood. The album art was derived from a painting by Jan Brueghel the Younger.

Chris became a vegan in 2011.

He created a new show called AM/FM in 2015.

In May 2023, Liebing did a remix for Depeche Mode&#x27;s Ghosts Again.

<doc id="618063" wikidata="Q248903" url="?curid=618063" title="Satellite phone">
<text>A satellite telephone, satellite phone or satphone is a type of mobile phone that connects to other phones or the telephone network by radio link through satellites orbiting the Earth instead of terrestrial cell sites, as cellphones do. Therefore, they can work in most geographic locations on the Earth&#x27;s surface, as long as open sky and the line-of-sight between the phone and the satellite are provided. Depending on the architecture of a particular system, coverage may include the entire Earth or only specific regions. Satellite phones provide similar functionality to terrestrial mobile telephones; voice calling, text messaging, and low-bandwidth Internet access are supported through most systems. The advantage of a satellite phone is that it can be used in such regions where local terrestrial communication infrastructures, such as landline and cellular networks, are not available.

Satellite phones are popular on expeditions into remote locations where there is no reliable cellular service, such as recreational hiking, hunting, fishing, and boating trips, as well as for business purposes, such as mining locations and maritime shipping. Satellite phones rarely get disrupted by natural disasters on Earth or human actions such as war, so they have proven to be dependable communication tools in emergency and humanitarian situations, when the local communications system have been compromised.

The mobile equipment, also known as a terminal, varies widely. Early satellite phone handsets had a size and weight comparable to that of a late-1980s or early-1990s mobile phone, but usually with a large retractable antenna. More recent satellite phones are similar in size to a regular mobile phone while some prototype satellite phones have no distinguishable difference from an ordinary smartphone.

A fixed installation such as one used aboard a ship may include large, rugged, rack-mounted electronics, and a steerable microwave antenna on the mast that automatically tracks the overhead satellites. Smaller installations using VoIP over a two-way satellite broadband service such as BGAN or VSAT bring the costs within the reach of leisure vessel owners. Internet service satellite phones have notoriously poor reception indoors, though it may be possible to get a consistent signal near a window or in the top floor of a building if the roof is sufficiently thin. The phones have connectors for external antennas that can be installed in vehicles and buildings. The systems also allow for the use of repeaters, much like terrestrial mobile phone systems.

In the early 2020s various manufacturers began to integrate satellite messaging connectivity and satellite emergency services into conventional mobile phones for use in remote regions, where there is no reliable terrestrial network.

==History==
The first satellite relayed phone calls were achieved early on in the space age, after the first relay test was conducted by Pioneer 1 and the first broadcast by SCORE in 1958 at the end of the year, after Sputnik I became at the beginning of the year the first satellite in history.

MARISAT was the first mobile communications satellite, eventually operated by the first privatized satellite communication INMARSAT organization, which was formed in 1979.

== Satellite network ==
Satellite phone systems can be classified into two types: systems that use satellites in a high geostationary orbit, above the Earth&#x27;s surface, and systems that use satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), above the Earth.

===Geostationary satellites===
Some satellite phones use satellites in geostationary orbit (GSO), which appear at a fixed position in the sky. These systems can maintain near-continuous global coverage with only three or four satellites, reducing the launch costs. The satellites used for these systems are very heavy (about 5000 kg) and expensive to build and launch. The satellites orbit at an altitude of above the Earth&#x27;s surface; a noticeable delay is present while making a phone call or using data services due to the large distance from users. The amount of bandwidth available on these systems is substantially higher than that of the low Earth orbit systems; all three active systems provide portable satellite Internet using laptop-sized terminals with speeds ranging from 60 to 512 kbit per second (kbps).

Geostationary satellite phones can only be used at lower latitudes, generally between 70 degrees north of the equator and 70 degrees south of the equator. At higher latitudes the satellite appears at such a low angle in the sky that radio frequency interference from terrestrial sources in the same frequency bands can interfere with the signal.

Another disadvantage of geostationary satellite systems is that in many areas—even where a large amount of open sky is present—the line-of-sight between the phone and the satellite is broken by obstacles such as steep hills and forest. The user will need to find an area with line-of-sight before using the phone. This is not the case with LEO services: even if the signal is blocked by an obstacle, one can wait a few minutes until another satellite passes overhead, but a GSO satellite may drop a call when line of sight is lost.
* ACeS: This former Indonesia-based small regional operator provided voice and data services in East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia using a single satellite. It ceased operations in 2014.
* Inmarsat: The oldest satellite phone operator, a British company founded in 1979. It originally provided large fixed installations for ships, but has recently entered the market of hand-held phones in a joint venture with ACeS. The company operates eleven satellites. Coverage is available on most of the Earth, except polar regions.
* Thuraya: Established in 1997, United Arab Emirates-based Thuraya&#x27;s satellites provide coverage across Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia.
* MSAT / SkyTerra: An American satellite-phone company that uses equipment similar to Inmarsat, but plans to launch a service using hand-held devices in the Americas similar to Thuraya&#x27;s.
* Terrestar: Satellite-phone system for North America.
* ICO Global Communications: An American satellite-phone company which has launched a single geosynchronous satellite, not yet active.
* Tiantong: A Chinese satellite-phone system is planned to provide satellite phone and short message sending and receiving functions to users in China and its surrounding areas, the Middle East, Africa and other related regions, as well as most of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

===Low Earth orbit===
Satellite phones may use satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO). The advantages include the possibility of providing worldwide wireless coverage with no gaps. LEO satellites orbit the Earth in high-speed, low-altitude orbits with an orbital time of 70–100 minutes, an altitude of . Since the satellites are not geostationary, they move with respect to the ground. Any given satellite is only in view of a phone for a short time, so the call must be &quot;handed off&quot; electronically to another satellite when one passes beyond the local horizon. Depending on the positions of both the satellite and terminal, a usable pass of an individual LEO satellite will typically last 4–15 minutes on average. At least one satellite must have line-of-sight to every coverage area at all times to guarantee coverage; thus a constellation of satellites, typically 40 to 70, is required to maintain worldwide coverage.
* Globalstar: A network covering most of the world&#x27;s landmass using 48 active satellites. However, many areas of the Earth&#x27;s surface are left without coverage, since a satellite requires to be in range of an Earth station gateway. Satellites fly in an inclined orbit of 52 degrees, therefore polar regions cannot be covered. The network went into full commercial service in February 2000. A second-generation constellation consists of 24 low Earth orbiting (LEO) satellites. The launch of the second-generation constellation was completed on 6 February 2013.
* Iridium: A network operating 66 satellites in a polar orbit that claims to have coverage everywhere on Earth. Radio cross-links are used between satellites to relay data to the nearest satellite with a connection to an Earth station. Commercial service started in November 1998 and fell into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1999. In 2001, service was re-established by Iridium Satellite LLC. Iridium NEXT, a second-generation constellation of the communications satellites, was completed on 11 January 2019.
Both systems, based in the United States, started in the late 1990s, but soon went into bankruptcy after failing to gain enough subscribers to fund launch costs. They are now operated by new owners who bought the assets for a fraction of their original cost and are now both planning to launch replacement constellations supporting higher bandwidth. Data speeds for current networks are between 2200 and 9600 bit/s using a satellite handset.

A third system was announced in 2022 when T-Mobile US and SpaceX announced a partnership to add satellite cellular service to Starlink second generation (Gen2) satellites that are to begin launching to orbit in late 2022. The service is aimed to provide dead-zone cell phone coverage across the US using existing midband PCS spectrum that T-Mobile owns. Cell coverage will begin with messaging and expand to include voice and limited data services later, with testing to begin in 2023. With Starlink Gen2 satellites in low Earth orbit using existing PCS spectrum, T-Mobile plans to be able to connect ordinary mobile phones to satellites, unlike earlier satellite phones in the market which used specialized radios to connect to geosynchronous-orbit satellites, which have longer communications latencies. T-Mobile has offered to extend the offering globally if cellular carriers in other countries wish to exchange roaming services via the T-Mobile partnership with SpaceX, with other carriers working with their regulators to enable midband communications landing rights on a country-by-country basis. Bandwidth will be limited to approximately 2 to 4 megabits per second spread across a very large cell coverage area, with thousands of voice calls or millions of text messages simultaneously in an area. The size of a single coverage area has not yet been specified.

====Geotracking====

LEO systems have the ability to track a mobile unit&#x27;s location using Doppler navigation from the satellite. However, this method can be inaccurate by tens of kilometers. On some Iridium hardware the coordinates can be extracted using AT commands, while recent Globalstar handsets will display them on the screen.

Most VSAT terminals can be reprogrammed in-field using AT-commands to bypass automatic acquisition of GPS coordinates and instead accept manually injected GPS coordinates.

==Virtual country codes==

Satellite phones are usually issued with numbers in a special country calling code.

Inmarsat satellite phones are issued with codes +870. In the past, additional country codes were allocated to different satellites, but the codes +871 to +874 were phased out at the end of 2008 leaving Inmarsat users with the same country code, regardless of which satellite their terminal is registered with.

Low Earth orbit systems including some of the defunct ones have been allocated number ranges in the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s Global Mobile Satellite System virtual country code +881. Iridium satellite phones are issued with codes +881 6 and +881 7. Globalstar, although allocated +881 8 and +881 9 use U.S. telephone numbers except for service resellers located in Brazil, which use the +881 range.

Small regional satellite phone networks are allocated numbers in the +882 code designated for &quot;international networks&quot; which is not used exclusively for satellite phone networks.

==Cost==
While it is possible to obtain used handsets for the Thuraya, Iridium, and Globalstar networks for approximately , the newest handsets are quite expensive. The Iridium 9505A, released in 2001, sold in March 2010 for over $1,000. Satellite phones are purpose-built for one particular network and cannot be switched to other networks. The price of handsets varies with network performance. If a satellite phone provider encounters trouble with its network, handset prices will fall, then increase once new satellites are launched. Similarly, handset prices will increase when calling rates are reduced.

Among the most expensive satellite phones are BGAN terminals, often costing several thousand dollars. These phones provide about 0.5 Mbit/s Internet and voice communications. Satellite phones are sometimes subsidised by the provider if one signs a post-paid contract, but subsidies are usually only a few hundred dollars or less.

Since most satellite phones are built under license or the manufacturing of handsets is contracted out to OEMs, operators have a large influence over the selling price. Satellite networks operate under proprietary protocols, making it difficult for manufacturers to independently make handsets.

A startup is proposing the use of standard mobile phone technology in satellites to enable low bandwidth text message with satellites from cheap mobile phones.

===Calling cost===
The cost of making voice calls from a satellite phone varies from around $0.15 to $2 per minute, while calling them from landlines and regular mobile phones is more expensive. Costs for data transmissions (particularly broadband data) can be much higher. Rates from landlines and mobile phones range from $3 to $14 per minute with Iridium, Thuraya and Inmarsat being some of the most expensive networks to call. The receiver of the call pays nothing, unless they are being called via a special reverse-charge service.

Calls between different satellite phone networks are often very expensive, with calling rates of up to $15 per minute.

Calls from satellite phones to landlines are usually around $0.80 to $1.50 per minute unless special offers are used. Such promotions are usually bound to a particular geographic area where traffic is low.

Most satellite phone networks have pre-paid plans, with vouchers ranging from $100 to $5,000.

==One-way services==
Some satellite phone networks provide a one-way paging channel to alert users in poor coverage areas (such as indoors) of the incoming call. When the alert is received on the satellite phone it must be taken to an area with better coverage before the call can be accepted.

Globalstar provides a one-way data uplink service, typically used for asset tracking.

Iridium operates a one-way pager service as well as the call alert feature.

==Legal restrictions==
In some countries, possession of a satellite phone is illegal. Their signals will usually bypass local telecoms systems, hindering censorship and wiretapping attempts, which has led some intelligence agencies to believe that satellite phones aid terrorist activity. It is also common for restrictions to be in place in countries with oppressive governments regimes as a way to both expose subversive agents within their country and maximize the control of the information that makes it past their borders.
* China – Inmarsat became the first company permitted to sell satellite phones in 2016. China Telecom began selling satellite phones in 2018 and six other satellite phone companies expressed their interest in entering the Chinese market shortly after.
* Cuba
* India – only Inmarsat-based satellite services are permitted within territories and areas under Indian jurisdiction. Importation and operation of all other satellite services, including Thuraya and Iridium, is illegal. International shipping is obliged to comply with Indian Directorate-General of Shipping (DGS) Order No. 02 of 2012 which prohibits the unauthorised import and operation of Thuraya, Iridium and other such satellite phones in Indian waters. The legislation to this effect is Section 6 of Indian Wireless Act and Section 20 of Indian Telegraph Act. International Long Distance (ILD) licences and No Objection Certificates (NOC) issued by Indian Department of Telecommunications (DOT) are mandatory for satellite communication services on Indian territory.
* Mauritius – In 2022, the Information and Communications Authority started regulating the ownership and use of satellite phones.
* Myanmar
* North Korea – The US Bureau of Diplomatic Security advises visitors that they have &quot;no right to privacy in North Korea and should assume your communications are monitored&quot; which excludes the possibility of satellite phone technology.
* Russia – in 2012, new regulations governing the use of satellite phones inside Russia or its territories were developed with the stated aim of fighting terrorism by enabling the Russian government to intercept calls. These regulations allow non-Russian visitors to register their SIM cards for use within Russian territory for up to six months.

==Security concerns==
All modern satellite phone networks encrypt voice traffic to prevent eavesdropping. In 2012, a team of academic security researchers reverse-engineered the two major proprietary encryption algorithms in use. One algorithm (used in GMR-1 phones) is a variant of the A5/2 algorithm used in GSM (used in common mobile phones), and both are vulnerable to cipher-text only attacks. The GMR-2 standard introduced a new encryption algorithm which the same research team also cryptanalysed successfully. Thus satellite phones need additional encrypting if used for high-security applications.

==Use in disaster response==
Most mobile telephone networks operate close to capacity during normal times, and large spikes in call volumes caused by widespread emergencies often overload the systems when they are needed most. Examples reported in the media where this has occurred include the 1999 İzmit earthquake, the September 11 attacks, the 2006 Kiholo Bay earthquake, the 2003 Northeast blackouts, Hurricane Katrina, the 2007 Minnesota bridge collapse, the 2010 Chile earthquake, and the 2010 Haiti earthquake. Reporters and journalists have also been using satellite phones to communicate and report on events in war zones such as Iraq.

Terrestrial cell antennas and networks can be damaged by natural disasters. Satellite telephony can avoid this problem and be useful during natural disasters. Satellite phone networks themselves are prone to congestion as satellites and spot beams cover a large area with relatively few voice channels.

== Dual connectivity phones (satellite and cellular) ==
In the early 2020s, manufacturers began to integrate satellite connectivity into smartphone devices for use in remote areas, out of the cellular network range. The satellite-to-phone services use L band frequencies, which are compatible with most modern handsets. However, due to the antenna limitations in the conventional phones, in the early stages of implementation satellite connectivity is limited to satellite messaging and satellite emergency services.

In 2018, Thuraya proposed a mobile phone capable of both classic cellular plus satellite connectivity, the X5 Touch, whom to be the world&#x27;s first bi-types &quot;satellite plus cellular&quot; smartphone.

Three years later, in 2021, Thuraya launched its second bi-type &quot;satellite plus cellular&quot; phone, the XT Lite, a reviewed of the X5 model.

In 2022, the Apple iPhone 14 started supporting sending emergency text messages via Globalstar satellites. Apple later acquires a 20% stake in the company in 2024. It is however not the first mobile phone to combine both cellular and satellite connectivity. In 2023, the Apple iPhone 15 added satellite communication with roadside service in the United States. In 2024, six years after the first bi-technology mobile phone, Thuraya launches the Skyphone, its new edition of 2018&#x27;s one, also made for 2G/3G/4G and satellite convergence within an Androïd-based phone.

* 2024 : Thuraya Skyphone

== Cellular connectivity via satellites from space ==
In 2022, T-Mobile formed a partnership to use Starlink services via existing LTE spectrum, expected in late 2024. In 2022, AST SpaceMobile started building a 3GPP standard-based cellular space network to allow existing, unmodified smartphones to connect to satellites in areas with coverage gaps. 

In 2023, Qualcomm announced Snapdragon Satellite, the service that will allow supported cellphones, starting with Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chipset, to send and receive text messages via 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN). 

In 2024, Iridium introduced Project Stardust, a standard-based satellite-to-cellphone service supported via NB-IoT for 5G non-terrestrial networks, which will be used over Iridium&#x27;s existing low-earth orbit satellites. Scheduled for launch in 2026, the service provides messaging, emergency communications and IoT for devices like cars, smartphones, tablets and related consumer applications.

<text>Helmuth Rilling (born 29 May 1933) is a German choral conductor and an academic teacher. He is the founder of the Gächinger Kantorei (1954), the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart (1965), the Oregon Bach Festival (1970), the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart (1981) and other Bach Academies worldwide, as well as the &quot;Festival Ensemble Stuttgart&quot; (2001) and the &quot;Junges Stuttgarter Bach Ensemble&quot; (2011). He taught choral conducting at the Frankfurt Musikhochschule from 1965 to 1989 and led the Frankfurter Kantorei from 1969 to 1982.

==Education==
Rilling was born into a musical family. He received his early training at the Protestant Seminaries in Württemberg. From 1952 to 1955 he studied organ, composition, and choral conducting at the Stuttgart College of Music. He completed his studies with Fernando Germani in Rome and at the Accademia Musicale Chigiana in Siena.

While still a student in 1954, he founded his first choir, the Gächinger Kantorei. Starting in 1957, he was organist and choirmaster at the Stuttgart Gedächtniskirche, conducting the choir Figuralchor der Gedächtniskirche Stuttgart. From 1963 to 1966, he taught organ and choral at the Spandauer Kirchenmusikschule, conducting the &quot;Spandauer Kantorei&quot; (Spandau chorale).

== Career ==
In 1967, he studied with Leonard Bernstein in New York and in the same year was appointed professor of choral conducting at the Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts, a post that he held until 1985. In 1969, Rilling took over as conductor of the Frankfurter Kantorei (Frankfurt Choir). Since 1965, he has conducted the Bach-Collegium Stuttgart, which often performs with the Gächinger Kantorei. He has toured widely with both ensembles.

He is well known for his performances of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach and his contemporaries. Rilling is the first person to have twice prepared and recorded (on modern instruments) the complete choral works of J. S. Bach, a monumental task involving well over 1,000 pieces of music - spanning 170 compact discs. He has also recorded many romantic and classical choral and orchestral works, including the works of Johannes Brahms. In 1988, Rilling conducted the world premiere of the &quot;Messa per Rossini&quot; that he also conducted at the Rheingau Musik Festival in 2001, where he has traditionally conducted the final concert.

Rilling co-founded the Oregon Bach Festival in 1970, and served as its artistic director until 2013. He also co-founded and led the Internationale Bachakademie Stuttgart since 1981. In 2001, Rilling created the Festival Ensemble to be part of the European Music Festival Stuttgart (&quot;Musikfest Stuttgart&quot;). Rilling became the Festival Conductor and lecturer at the Toronto Bach Festival in 2004.

Rilling was a teacher of chorale conducting at the Frankfurt Musikhochschule from 1965 to 1989.

== Recordings and awards ==
Rilling&#x27;s recording of Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s Credo, commissioned and performed by the Oregon Bach Festival, won the 2001 Grammy Award for best choral performance. He received the Bach Medal in 2004. In 2008, Rilling was awarded the Sanford Award by the Yale School of Music at Yale University. He was the 2011 recipient of the Herbert von Karajan Music Prize.

For Rilling&#x27;s 75th birthday, his record label Hänssler Classic released his entire Bach edition on iTunes.

<doc id="618073" wikidata="Q1933689" url="?curid=618073" title="Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée">
<text>Pierre-Claude Nivelle de La Chaussée (14 February 1692 in Paris – 14 May 1754 in Paris) was a French dramatist who blurred the lines between comedy and tragedy with his &quot;comédie larmoyante&quot;.

In 1731 he published an &quot;Epître de Clio&quot;, a didactic poem in defense of Leriget de la Faye in his dispute with Antoine Houdar de la Motte, who had maintained that verse was useless in tragedy. La Chaussée was forty years old before he produced his first play, &quot;La Fausse Antipathie&quot; (1734). His second play, &quot;Le Préjugé à la mode&quot; (1735) turns on the fear of incurring ridicule felt by a man in love with his own wife, a prejudice dispelled in France, according to La Harpe, by La Chaussée&#x27;s comedy. &quot;L&#x27;École des amis&quot; (1737) followed, and, after an unsuccessful attempt at tragedy in &quot;Maximinien&quot;, he returned to comedy in &quot;Mélanide&quot; (1741).

&quot;Mélanide&quot; fully develops the type known as &quot;comédie larmoyante&quot;. Comedy was no longer to provoke laughter, but tears. The innovation consisted in destroying the sharp distinction then existing between tragedy and comedy in French literature. Indications of this change had been already offered in the work of Marivaux, and La Chaussée&#x27;s plays led naturally to the domestic drama of Diderot and of Sedaine. The new method found bitter enemies. Alexis Piron nicknames the author &quot;le Révérend Père Chaussée,&quot; and ridiculed him in one of his most famous epigrams.

Voltaire maintained that the &quot;comédie larmoyante&quot; was a proof of the inability of the author to produce either of the recognized kinds of drama, though he himself produced a play of similar character in &quot;L&#x27;Enfant prodigue&quot;. The hostility of the critics did not prevent the public from shedding tears nightly over the sorrows of La Chaussée&#x27;s heroine.

&quot;L’École des Mères&quot; (1744) and &quot;La Gouvernante&quot; (1747) form, with those already mentioned, the best of his work. The strict moral aims pursued by La Chaussée in his plays seem hardly consistent with his private preferences. He frequented the same high society as did the comte de Caylus and contributed to the &quot;Recueils de ces messieurs&quot;. Villemain said of his style that he wrote prosaic verses with purity, while Voltaire, usually an adverse critic of his work, said he was &quot;un des premiers après ceux qui ont du génie.&quot;

For the &quot;comédie larmoyante&quot; see Gustave Lanson, &quot;Ninette de la Chaussée et la comédie larmoyante&quot; (1887).

<doc id="618075" wikidata="Q313829" url="?curid=618075" title="Milan I of Serbia">
<text>Milan Obrenović (; 22 August 1854 – 11 February 1901) reigned as the Prince of Serbia from 10 June 1868 until 1882, when he became King of Serbia, a title he held until his abdication on 6 March 1889. His son, Alexander I of Serbia, became the second King of Serbia.

==Early years==

===Birth and infancy in exile===
Milan Obrenović was born in 1854 in Mărășești in Moldavia, where his family had lived in exile ever since the return of the rival House of Karađorđević to the Serbian throne in 1842 when they managed to depose Milan&#x27;s cousin Prince Mihailo Obrenović III.

Milan was the son of and of his Moldavian wife Marija Obrenović, née Elena Maria Catargiu (1831–1879). Milan&#x27;s paternal grandfather (Miloš&#x27;s father) was Jevrem Obrenović (1790–1856), brother of Miloš Obrenović I, Prince of Serbia from 1815 to 1839 and from 1858 to 1860. Milan was therefore Prince Miloš&#x27;s grandnephew. He had only one sibling — his older sister Tomanija.

In 1855, shortly after Milan&#x27;s birth, his parents divorced. When Milan was aged 7, his father Miloš died on 20 November 1860 (or 1861) while fighting the Turks near Bucharest as a foreign mercenary in the Romanian Army, meaning that his mother Marija got legal custody. Marija, however, lived a lavish aristocratic lifestyle, soon becoming Romanian ruler Alexandru Ioan Cuza&#x27;s mistress and bearing him two sons — Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza (nicknamed Sașa) and Dimitrie. As a result, she showed little interest in her children from her previous marriage with Miloš. Therefore, an agreement was reached for young Milan to be legally adopted by his cousin Mihailo Obrenović, who in the meantime, following the 1858 expulsion of the House of Karađorđević, had returned to Serbia and had become the ruling prince in 1860.

===Arriving in Serbia===
Milan was brought to Kragujevac by Prince Mihailo Obrenović III who also arranged for a governess to raise the youngster. Decades later, once Milan became a king, details of his mother&#x27;s personal life were often used by his political opponents, notably People&#x27;s Radical Party (NRS) leader Stojan Protić who went as far as making an untrue accusation in his paper &quot;Samouprava&quot; that King Milan&#x27;s father was actually Alexandru Ioan Cuza, referring to King Milan pejoratively as Kuzić instead of Obrenović.

After bringing his nephew to Serbia, Prince Mihailo also took care of the youngster&#x27;s education, sending him to Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris where young Milan reportedly displayed considerable maturity.

==Prince of Serbia (1868–1882)==
On 10 June 1868, when Milan was only fourteen years of age, Prince Mihailo Obrenović III was assassinated. As the late prince did not have any male heirs, the question of who was to succeed him on the Serbian throne became a pressing one. In the post-assassination chaos and the resulting power vacuum, influential senior statesman Ilija Garašanin re-emerged in Serbian political life, despite only eight months earlier being removed by the late prince from the post of Prime Minister of Serbia and replaced with Jovan Ristić. While consolidating forces within the state to prevent the conspirators from taking over the power, Garašanin also reportedly contemplated solving the throne issue by starting a third royal dynasty. General political consensus was that the new ruler should be selected by the Visoka narodna skupština (Grand National Assembly). However, cabinet minister Milivoje Petrović Blaznavac was rapidly increasing his power and influence. He had managed to consolidate his control over the army and stage a coup d&#x27;état. So when Blaznavac suggested the young Milan as the successor to Prince Mihailo, Garašanin had no choice but to yield to the more powerful authority.

===Regency of Milivoje Petrović Blaznavac===
As Milan was still underage to rule on his own, a regency was established to rule in Milan&#x27;s name. The three-man council was headed by Blaznavac. Statesman and historian Jovan Ristić and Jovan Gavrilović, a politician and historian from a wealthy merchant family rounded out the trio.

Young Milan was brought back to Serbia from Paris and enthroned in front of the Topčider assembly while the Blaznavac-controlled army surrounded the building just in case. Furthermore, a prominent Serb nobleman from Dubrovnik, Medo Pucić, was brought to Belgrade to serve as a teacher and adviser to the prince.

Under Blaznavac&#x27;s tutelage, both personally and politically, the prince deferred to the head of the regency council in all matters of state. Prince Milan did not benefit from a large inheritance from his wealthy family as all of Prince Mihailo&#x27;s vast property went to Mihailo&#x27;s sisters (Prince Miloš&#x27;s daughters) Petrija&#x27;s and Savka&#x27;s children. The only property young Prince Milan did inherit was his late father&#x27;s compound in Mărășești that had an overwhelming amount of debt associated with it.

On 2 January 1869, the third Serbian constitution, mostly Ristić&#x27;s creation, was promulgated.

In 1871, the prince faced two separate incidents although it is unclear as to whether these were genuine attempts on his life. In May as he exited the National Theatre building, a bomb exploded a couple of hundred metres away on Terazije. Buried under a footpath, the exploded device didn&#x27;t cause anyone injuries. At the time and there was speculation in Serbia that it was Blaznavac who had organised the explosion in order to scare and confuse the young prince who was nearing his age of majority into remaining reliant on Blaznavac. The event became known as the (Terazije Bomb) in the Serbian historiography.
Several months later, on 6 October, Prince Milan was involved in another incident, this time during a visit to Smederevo. At some point, he went to an outhouse to relieve himself and while above the pit toilet, the wooden floor caved in under his weight and he fell into the pit. As he was armed at the time, the prince began shooting from his pistol in order get the attention of his entourage who rescued him. Historical accounts of the nature of this event differ. Historian Slobodan Jovanović thinks the occurrence was &quot;likely coincidental&quot;. On the other hand, historian Leontije Pavlović in his book &quot;Smederevo u XIX veku&quot; (Smederevo in the Nineteenth Century) states the conspirators doused the wooden floor with nitric acid that ate away at the planks. However, these claims couldn&#x27;t be confirmed as he based them on an item from the historical archives that has since disappeared. The entire episode is known as the (double meaning: The Smederevo Furniture or the Smederevo Setup).

===Prince reaches the age of majority===
On 22 August 1872, Milan was declared of age, and he took government into his own hands. He soon demonstrated great intellectual capacity, coupled with a passionate headstrong character. Eugene Schuyler, who observed him about this time, found him to be a very remarkable, singularly intelligent and well-informed young man. The Principality of Serbia was still a &quot;de jure&quot; part of the Ottoman Empire though in reality it already had long functioned as a semi-independent state whose politics and economy was much more dependent on other Great Powers, particularly Austria-Hungary and the Russian Empire, than on its formal ruler, the declining Ottomans. Milan carefully manoeuvred between the Austrian and Russian geopolitical interests in Serbia, with a judicious leaning towards the former.

When Serbs from the neighbouring Bosnia Vilayet (also part of the Ottoman Empire, though more integrated and loyal due to its large Muslim population) began an uprising in July 1875 on the outskirts of Nevesinje, protesting the tax system as well as harsh treatment under local beys and aghas, Prince Milan condemned the uprising and refused to take part in it. The rival House of Karađorđević, whose members lived in exile across Europe, had a different approach, taking part in organising and implementing the uprising. Their actions included the 31-year-old Petar Karađorđević going to the Herzegovina region in order to fight under the pseudonym Petar Mrkonjić. As the uprising grew, spreading to the rest of Herzegovina and soon engulfing the entire Bosnia Vilayet, domestic pressure in the Serbian principality increased on young Prince Milan to help his Serb brethren.

===Marriage===
Milan married Natalie Keshko on at the St. Michael&#x27;s Cathedral, Belgrade, Serbia. Natalie, sixteen years of age, was the daughter of Bessarabian nobleman Petre Ivanovich Keschko, who served as a colonel in Imperial Russian Army. Natalie&#x27;s mother, Pulcheria, was by birth Princess Sturdza, meaning that the couple were fairly close second cousins because Milan&#x27;s mother Elena and Natalie&#x27;s father Petre were the children of two sisters, meaning that Milan and Natalija shared a set of great-grandparents. This relation meant that their marriage had to be specifically approved by the church, namely Metropolitan Mihailo Jovanović, the Metropolitan of Belgrade, however, this wasn&#x27;t done.

A son, Alexander, was born to Natalija and Milan in 1876, but their relationship showed signs of friction right from the start.
===Serbian–Ottoman Wars===
It was under Milan&#x27;s reign that the First Serbian–Ottoman War broke out, against his own personal preference, out of deference to public opinion. Meanwhile, the Karađorđević pretender, Peter, fought for the Serbs as a volunteer. 

The Serbian effort to invade Turkish territory was stopped to the east of Zaječar, while Turkish troops destroyed the strategic Serbian post of Knjaževac. Retreating Serbian troops were then defeated at Aleksinac. 

As the Serbian military situation became desperate Prince Milan asked for the Great Powers to intervene, and an armistice was granted by the Ottomans, but it fell apart in the wake of the Deligrad Event. 

The resumed fighting went in favor of the Ottomans, and after the fall of Đunis, Ottoman troops began their march to Belgrade. It was at this point that the government of the Russian Empire intervened offering an ultimatum to the Porte to grant both Serbia and Montenegro an armistice within 48 hours or face Russian intervention. Such an armistice to last for two months was granted on November 1, 1876, and subsequently extended until March 1, 1877, when a definitive peace treaty was signed between the Ottoman Empire and the Kingdom of Serbia. The treaty preserved the status quo ante bellum. Serbia gained no territory, but was not forced to cede anything either or pay a war indemnity. 

At the end of the Serbo-Turkish War (1876–78), Europe&#x27;s powers induced the Sublime Porte to acknowledge Serbian independence at the Treaty of Berlin.

==King of Serbia (1882–1889)==
On 6 March 1882, the Principality of Serbia was declared a kingdom and Milan was proclaimed King of Serbia.

Acting under Austro-Hungarian influence, King Milan devoted all his energies to the improvement of the means of communication and the development of natural resources. However, the cost of this, unduly increased by reckless extravagance, led to disproportionately heavy taxation. This, coupled with increased military service, rendered King Milan and the Austrian party unpopular.


Milan&#x27;s political troubles were further increased by the defeat of the Serbians in the war against Bulgaria from 1885–1886. In September 1885, the union of Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria caused widespread agitation in Serbia. Milan promptly declared war upon the new Bulgarian state on 15 November. After a short, decisive campaign, the Serbs were utterly routed at the Battle of Slivnitsa and at the Battle of Pirot. Milan&#x27;s throne was only saved by the direct intervention of Austria-Hungary. Domestic difficulties now arose which rapidly assumed political significance.

In his personal life, Milan was anything but a faithful husband, having an affair with most notably Jennie Jerome (wife of Lord Randolph Churchill and mother to Winston Churchill) among others, while Queen Natalija was greatly influenced by Russian sympathies. In 1886, the couple, mismatched both personally and politically, separated after eleven years of marriage.

Natalija withdrew from the kingdom, taking with her the ten-year-old Prince Alexander (later King Alexander I). While she was residing at Wiesbaden in 1888, King Milan succeeded in recovering the crown prince, whom he undertook to educate. In reply to the queen&#x27;s remonstrances, Milan exerted considerable pressure upon the Metropolitan of Belgrade, and procured a divorce, which was afterwards annulled as illegal. King Milan now seemed master of the situation.

On 3 January 1889, Milan adopted a new constitution much more liberal than the existing one of 1869. Two months later, on 6 March, thirty-four-year-old Milan suddenly abdicated the throne, handing it over to his twelve-year-old son. No satisfactory reason was assigned for this step. Milan settled in Paris as a private individual.

In 2020, a number of letters written in French by King Milan were discovered. In the letter Milan I of Serbia advised his son how to rule and gave critical comments on political figures of his time, such as PM Nikola Pašić.

==Post-monarchical role==
In February 1891, a Radical ministry was formed. Queen Natalija and the ex-Metropolitan Mihailo returned to Belgrade, and Austrian influence began to give way to Russian. Fear of a revolution and King Milan&#x27;s return led to a compromise, by which, in May 1891, the queen was expelled, and Milan was allowed a million francs from the civil list, on condition of not returning to Serbia during his son&#x27;s minority.

In March 1892, Milan renounced all his rights and even his Serbian nationality. The situation altered dramatically, however, after the young Alexander I had effected his &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; and taken the government into his own hands in April 1893. Serbian politics began to grow more complicated, and Russian influence was rife. In January 1894, Milan suddenly appeared in Belgrade, and his son gladly welcomed his experience and advice.
On 29 April, a royal decree reinstated Milan and Natalija, who in the meantime had become ostensibly reconciled, in their positions as members of the royal family. On 21 May, the constitution of 1869 was restored, and Milan continued to exercise considerable influence over his son. The queen, who had been residing chiefly at Biarritz, returned to Belgrade in May 1895, after four years of absence, and was greeted by the populace with great enthusiasm. At this, the ex-king again left the country.

After reconciliation with his son, Milan returned to Serbia in 1897, to be appointed as commander-in-chief of the Royal Serbian Army. In this capacity, he did some of the best work of his life, and his success in improving the Serbian military system was very marked. His relations with the young king also remained good for a time. The Serbian pro-Democratic opposition blamed him for the increasingly authoritarian rule of the young King, and a member of the Radical Party attempted to kill him on 6 July 1899 (24 June OS), on the Orthodox holiday of Ivanjdan (Birth of St. John the Baptist).

The good relations between father and son were interrupted, however, by the latter&#x27;s marriage to Draga Mašin in July 1900. Milan opposed the match to the point that he resigned his post as commander-in-chief. Alexander subsequently banished Milan from Serbia. Milan left Serbia to Karlsbad, then to Timișoara and finally retired to Vienna. On 11 February 1901, Milan died unexpectedly. He was buried in Krušedol monastery, next to his grandaunt Princess Ljubica, Prince Miloš&#x27;s wife.

<text>Opticks: or, A Treatise of the Reflexions, Refractions, Inflexions and Colours of Light is a collection of three books by Isaac Newton that was published in English in 1704 (a scholarly Latin translation appeared in 1706). The treatise analyzes the fundamental nature of light by means of the refraction of light with prisms and lenses, the diffraction of light by closely spaced sheets of glass, and the behaviour of color mixtures with spectral lights or pigment powders. &quot;Opticks&quot; was Newton&#x27;s second major work on physical science and it is considered one of the three major works on optics during the Scientific Revolution (alongside Johannes Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Astronomiae Pars Optica&quot; and Christiaan Huygens&#x27; &quot;Treatise on Light&quot;).

==Overview==
The publication of &quot;Opticks&quot; represented a major contribution to science, different from but in some ways rivalling the &quot;Principia&quot;, yet Isaac Newton&#x27;s name did not appear on the cover page of the first edition. &quot;Opticks&quot; is largely a record of experiments and the deductions made from them, covering a wide range of topics in what was later to be known as physical optics. That is, this work is not a geometric discussion of catoptrics or dioptrics, the traditional subjects of reflection of light by mirrors of different shapes and the exploration of how light is &quot;bent&quot; as it passes from one medium, such as air, into another, such as water or glass. Rather, the &quot;Opticks&quot; is a study of the nature of light and colour and the various phenomena of diffraction, which Newton called the &quot;inflexion&quot; of light.

Newton sets forth in full his experiments, first reported to the Royal Society of London in 1672, on dispersion, or the separation of light into a spectrum of its component colours. He demonstrates how the appearance of color arises from selective absorption, reflection, or transmission of the various component parts of the incident light.

The major significance of Newton&#x27;s work is that it overturned the dogma, attributed to Aristotle or Theophrastus and accepted by scholars in Newton&#x27;s time, that &quot;pure&quot; light (such as the light attributed to the Sun) is fundamentally white or colourless, and is altered into color by mixture with darkness caused by interactions with matter. Newton showed the opposite was true: light is composed of different spectral hues (he describes seven – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet), and all colours, including white, are formed by various mixtures of these hues. He demonstrates that color arises from a physical property of light – each hue is refracted at a characteristic angle by a prism or lens – but he clearly states that color is a sensation within the mind and not an inherent property of material objects or of light itself. For example, he demonstrates that a red violet (magenta) color can be mixed by overlapping the red and violet ends of two spectra, although this color does not appear in the spectrum and therefore is not a &quot;color of light&quot;. By connecting the red and violet ends of the spectrum, he organised all colours as a color circle that both quantitatively predicts color mixtures and qualitatively describes the perceived similarity among hues.

Newton&#x27;s contribution to prismatic dispersion was the first to outline multiple-prism arrays. Multiple-prism configurations, as beam expanders, became central to the design of the tunable laser more than 275 years later and set the stage for the development of the multiple-prism dispersion theory.

==Comparison to the &quot;Principia&quot;==

&quot;Opticks&quot; differs in many respects from the &quot;Principia&quot;. It was first published in English rather than in the Latin used by European philosophers, contributing to the development of a vernacular science literature. The books were a model of popular science exposition: although Newton&#x27;s English is somewhat dated—he shows a fondness for lengthy sentences with much embedded qualifications—the book can still be easily understood by a modern reader. In contrast, few readers of Newton&#x27;s time found the &quot;Principia&quot; accessible or even comprehensible. His formal but flexible style shows colloquialisms and metaphorical word choice.

Unlike the &quot;Principia&quot;, &quot;Opticks&quot; is not developed using the geometric convention of propositions proved by deduction from either previous propositions, lemmas or first principles (or axioms). Instead, axioms define the meaning of technical terms or fundamental properties of matter and light, and the stated propositions are demonstrated by means of specific, carefully described experiments. The first sentence of Book I declares &quot;&quot;My Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments.&quot; In an &quot;Experimentum crucis&quot; or &quot;critical experiment&quot; (Book I, Part II, Theorem ii), Newton showed that the color of light corresponded to its &quot;degree of refrangibility&quot; (angle of refraction), and that this angle cannot be changed by additional reflection or refraction or by passing the light through a coloured filter.

The work is a &quot;vade mecum&quot; of the experimenter&#x27;s art, displaying in many examples how to use observation to propose factual generalisations about the physical world and then exclude competing explanations by specific experimental tests. Unlike the &quot;Principia&quot;, which vowed &quot;Non fingo hypotheses&quot; or &quot;I make no hypotheses&quot; outside the deductive method, the &quot;Opticks&quot; develops conjectures about light that go beyond the experimental evidence: for example, that the physical behaviour of light was due its &quot;corpuscular&quot; nature as small particles, or that perceived colours were harmonically proportioned like the tones of a diatonic musical scale.

==Queries==

Newton originally considered to write four books, but he dropped the last book on action at a distance. Instead he concluded &quot;Opticks&quot; a set of unanswered questions and positive assertions referred as queries in Book III. The first set of queries were brief, but the later ones became short essays, filling many pages. In the first edition, these were sixteen such queries; that number was increased to 23 in the Latin edition, published in 1706, and then in the revised English edition, published in 1717/18. In the fourth edition of 1730, there were 31 queries.

These queries, especially the later ones, deal with a wide range of physical phenomena that go beyond the topic of optics. The queries concern the nature and transmission of heat; the possible cause of gravity; electrical phenomena; the nature of chemical action; the way in which God created matter; the proper way to do science; and even the ethical conduct of human beings. These queries are not really questions in the ordinary sense. These queries are almost all posed in the negative, as rhetorical questions. That is, Newton does not ask whether light &quot;is&quot; or &quot;may be&quot; a &quot;body.&quot; Rather, he declares: &quot;Is not Light a Body?&quot; Stephen Hales, a firm Newtonian of the early eighteenth century, declared that this was Newton&#x27;s way of explaining &quot;by &quot;Quaere&quot;.&quot;

The first query reads: &quot;Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance, and by their action bend its Rays; and is not this action (&quot;caeteris paribus&quot;) strongest at the least distance?&quot; suspecting on the effect of gravity on the trajectory of light rays. This query predates the prediction of gravitational lensing by Albert Einstein&#x27;s general relativity by two centuries and later confirmed by Eddington experiment in 1919. The first part of query 30 reads &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another&quot; thereby anticipating mass-energy equivalence. Query 6 of the book reads &quot;Do not black Bodies conceive heat more easily from Light than those of other Colours do, by reason that the Light falling on them is not reflected outwards, but enters into the Bodies, and is often reflected and refracted within them, until it be stifled and lost?&quot;, thereby introducing the concept of a black body.

The last query (number 31) wonders if a corpuscular theory could explain how different substances react more to certain substances than to others, in particular how aqua fortis (nitric acid) reacts more with calamine that with iron. This 31st query has been often been linked to the origin of the concept of affinity in chemical reactions. Various 18th century historians and chemists like William Cullen and Torbern Bergman, credited Newton for the development affinity tables.

==Reception==
The &quot;Opticks&quot; was widely read and debated in England and on the Continent. The early presentation of the work to the Royal Society stimulated a bitter dispute between Newton and Robert Hooke over the &quot;corpuscular&quot; or particle theory of light, which prompted Newton to postpone publication of the work until after Hooke&#x27;s death in 1703. On the Continent, and in France in particular, both the &quot;Principia&quot; and the &quot;Opticks&quot; were initially rejected by many natural philosophers, who continued to defend Cartesian natural philosophy and the Aristotelian version of color, and claimed to find Newton&#x27;s prism experiments difficult to replicate. Indeed, the Aristotelian theory of the fundamental nature of white light was defended into the 19th century, for example by the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his 1810 &quot;Theory of Colours&quot; ().

Newtonian science became a central issue in the assault waged by the &quot;philosophes&quot; in the Age of Enlightenment against a natural philosophy based on the authority of ancient Greek or Roman naturalists or on deductive reasoning from first principles (the method advocated by French philosopher René Descartes), rather than on the application of mathematical reasoning to experience or experiment. Voltaire popularised Newtonian science, including the content of both the &quot;Principia&quot; and the &quot;Opticks&quot;, in his &quot;Elements de la philosophie de Newton&quot; (1738), and after about 1750 the combination of the experimental methods exemplified by the &quot;Opticks&quot; and the mathematical methods exemplified by the &quot;Principia&quot; were established as a unified and comprehensive model of Newtonian science. Some of the primary adepts in this new philosophy were such prominent figures as Benjamin Franklin, Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier, and James Black.

Subsequent to Newton, much has been amended. Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel showed that the wave theory Christiaan Huygens described in his &quot;Treatise on Light&quot; (1690) could prove that colour is the visible manifestation of light&#x27;s wavelength. Science also slowly came to recognize the difference between perception of colour and mathematisable optics. The German poet Goethe, with his epic diatribe &quot;Theory of Colours&quot;, could not shake the Newtonian foundation – but &quot;one hole Goethe did find in Newton&#x27;s armour.. Newton had committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour was impossible. He therefore thought that the object-glasses of telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction being incompatible. This inference was proved by Dollond to be wrong.&quot; (John Tyndall, 1880)

<text>Power engineering, also called power systems engineering, is a subfield of electrical engineering that deals with the generation, transmission, distribution, and utilization of electric power, and the electrical apparatus connected to such systems. Although much of the field is concerned with the problems of three-phase AC power – the standard for large-scale power transmission and distribution across the modern world – a significant fraction of the field is concerned with the conversion between AC and DC power and the development of specialized power systems such as those used in aircraft or for electric railway networks. Power engineering draws the majority of its theoretical base from electrical engineering and mechanical engineering.

==History==


==Pioneering years==
Electricity became a subject of scientific interest in the late 17th century. Over the next two centuries a number of important discoveries were made including the incandescent light bulb and the voltaic pile. Probably the greatest discovery with respect to power engineering came from Michael Faraday who in 1831 discovered that a change in magnetic flux induces an electromotive force in a loop of wire—a principle known as electromagnetic induction that helps explain how generators and transformers work.

In 1881 two electricians built the world&#x27;s first power station at Godalming in England. The station employed two waterwheels to produce an alternating current that was used to supply seven Siemens arc lamps at 250 volts and thirty-four incandescent lamps at 40 volts. However supply was intermittent and in 1882 Thomas Edison and his company, The Edison Electric Light Company, developed the first steam-powered electric power station on Pearl Street in New York City. The Pearl Street Station consisted of several generators and initially powered around 3,000 lamps for 59 customers. The power station used direct current and operated at a single voltage. Since the direct current power could not be easily transformed to the higher voltages necessary to minimise power loss during transmission, the possible distance between the generators and load was limited to around half-a-mile (800 m).

That same year in London Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs demonstrated the first transformer suitable for use in a real power system. The practical value of Gaulard and Gibbs&#x27; transformer was demonstrated in 1884 at Turin where the transformer was used to light up forty kilometres (25 miles) of railway from a single alternating current generator. Despite the success of the system, the pair made some fundamental mistakes. Perhaps the most serious was connecting the primaries of the transformers in series so that switching one lamp on or off would affect other lamps further down the line. Following the demonstration George Westinghouse, an American entrepreneur, imported a number of the transformers along with a Siemens generator and set his engineers to experimenting with them in the hopes of improving them for use in a commercial power system.

One of Westinghouse&#x27;s engineers, William Stanley, recognised the problem with connecting transformers in series as opposed to parallel and also realised that making the iron core of a transformer a fully enclosed loop would improve the voltage regulation of the secondary winding. Using this knowledge he built the world&#x27;s first practical transformer based alternating current power system at Great Barrington, Massachusetts in 1886. In 1885 the Italian physicist and electrical engineer Galileo Ferraris demonstrated an induction motor and in 1887 and 1888 the Serbian-American engineer Nikola Tesla filed a range of patents related to power systems including one for a practical two-phase induction motor which Westinghouse licensed for his AC system.

By 1890 the power industry had flourished and power companies had built thousands of power systems (both direct and alternating current) in the United States and Europe – these networks were effectively dedicated to providing electric lighting. During this time a fierce rivalry in the US known as the &quot;war of the currents&quot; emerged between Edison and Westinghouse over which form of transmission (direct or alternating current) was superior. In 1891, Westinghouse installed the first major power system that was designed to drive an electric motor and not just provide electric lighting. The installation powered a synchronous motor at Telluride, Colorado with the motor being started by a Tesla induction motor. On the other side of the Atlantic, Oskar von Miller built a 20 kV 176 km three-phase transmission line from Lauffen am Neckar to Frankfurt am Main for the Electrical Engineering Exhibition in Frankfurt. In 1895, after a protracted decision-making process, the Adams No. 1 generating station at Niagara Falls began transmitting three-phase alternating current power to Buffalo at 11 kV. Following completion of the Niagara Falls project, new power systems increasingly chose alternating current as opposed to direct current for electrical transmission.

==Twentieth century==
===Power engineering and Bolshevism===

The generation of electricity was regarded as particularly important following the Bolshevik seizure of power. Lenin stated &quot;Communism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.&quot; He was subsequently featured on many Soviet posters, stamps etc. presenting this view. The GOELRO plan was initiated in 1920 as the first Bolshevik experiment in industrial planning and in which Lenin became personally involved. Gleb Krzhizhanovsky was another key figure involved, having been involved in the construction of a power station in Moscow in 1910. He had also known Lenin since 1897 when they were both in the St. Petersburg chapter of the &quot;Union of Struggle for the Liberation of the Working Class&quot;.

===Power engineering in the USA===
In 1936 the first commercial high-voltage direct current (HVDC) line using mercury-arc valves was built between Schenectady and Mechanicville, New York. HVDC had previously been achieved by installing direct current generators in series (a system known as the Thury system) although this suffered from serious reliability issues. In 1957 Siemens demonstrated the first solid-state rectifier (solid-state rectifiers are now the standard for HVDC systems) however it was not until the early 1970s that this technology was used in commercial power systems. In 1959 Westinghouse demonstrated the first circuit breaker that used SF6 as the interrupting medium. SF6 is a far superior dielectric to air and, in recent times, its use has been extended to produce far more compact switching equipment (known as switchgear) and transformers. Many important developments also came from extending innovations in the ICT field to the power engineering field. For example, the development of computers meant load flow studies could be run more efficiently allowing for much better planning of power systems. Advances in information technology and telecommunication also allowed for much better remote control of the power system&#x27;s switchgear and generators.

==Power==
Power Engineering deals with the generation, transmission, distribution and utilization of electricity as well as the design of a range of related devices. These include transformers, electric generators, electric motors and power electronics.

Power engineers may also work on systems that do not connect to the grid. These systems are called off-grid power systems and may be used in preference to on-grid systems for a variety of reasons. For example, in remote locations it may be cheaper for a mine to generate its own power rather than pay for connection to the grid and in most mobile applications connection to the grid is simply not practical.

==Fields==

Electricity generation covers the selection, design and construction of facilities that convert energy from primary forms to electric power.

Electric power transmission requires the engineering of high voltage transmission lines and substation facilities to interface to generation and distribution systems. High voltage direct current systems are one of the elements of an electric power grid.

Electric power distribution engineering covers those elements of a power system from a substation to the end customer.

Power system protection is the study of the ways an electrical power system can fail, and the methods to detect and mitigate for such failures.

In most projects, a power engineer must coordinate with many other disciplines such as civil and mechanical engineers, environmental experts, and legal and financial personnel. Major power system projects such as a large generating station may require scores of design professionals in addition to the power system engineers. At most levels of professional power system engineering practice, the engineer will require as much in the way of administrative and organizational skills as electrical engineering knowledge.

==Professional societies and international standards organizations==
In both the UK and the US, professional societies had long existed for civil and mechanical engineers. The Institution of Electrical Engineers (IEE) was founded in the UK in 1871, and the AIEE in the United States in 1884. These societies contributed to the exchange of electrical knowledge and the development of electrical engineering education. 
On an international level, the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which was founded in 1906, prepares standards for power engineering, with 20,000 electrotechnical experts from 172 countries developing global specifications based on consensus.

<text>Interpretability logics comprise a family of modal logics that extend provability logic to describe interpretability or various related metamathematical properties and relations such as weak interpretability, Π1-conservativity, cointerpretability, tolerance, cotolerance, and arithmetic complexities. 

Main contributors to the field are Alessandro Berarducci, Petr Hájek, Konstantin Ignatiev, Giorgi Japaridze, Franco Montagna, Vladimir Shavrukov, Rineke Verbrugge, Albert Visser, and Domenico Zambella.

== Examples ==

=== Logic ILM ===

The language of ILM extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the unary modal operator formula_1 and the binary modal operator formula_2 (as always, formula_3 is defined as formula_4). The arithmetical interpretation of formula_5 is “formula_6 is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA)”, and formula_7 is understood as “formula_8 is interpretable in formula_9”. 

Axiom schemata: 

# All classical tautologies
# formula_10
# formula_11
# formula_12
# formula_13
# formula_14
# formula_15
# formula_16
# formula_17

Rules of inference: 

# “From formula_6 and formula_19 conclude formula_20” 
# “From formula_6 conclude formula_5”.

The completeness of ILM with respect to its arithmetical interpretation was independently proven by Alessandro Berarducci and Vladimir Shavrukov.

=== Logic TOL ===

The language of TOL extends that of classical propositional logic by adding the modal operator formula_23 which is allowed to take any nonempty sequence of arguments. The arithmetical interpretation of formula_24 is “formula_25 is a tolerant sequence of theories”. 
Axioms (with formula_26 standing for any formulas, formula_27 for any sequences of formulas, and formula_28 identified with ⊤): 

# All classical tautologies
# formula_29
# formula_30
# formula_31
# formula_32
# formula_33
# formula_34

Rules of inference: 

# “From formula_6 and formula_19 conclude formula_20” 
# “From formula_38 conclude formula_39”.

The completeness of TOL with respect to its arithmetical interpretation was proven by Giorgi Japaridze.

<text>Qinqiang (秦腔, pinyin: Qín qiāng, literally &quot;Qin&#x27;s tune&quot;) is a genre of folk Chinese opera originated in Shaanxi Province of Qing China in 1807 and soon took over other genres to be the representative genre of the province. Historically, there were two separate genres both referring themselves as Qinqiang, the one with a longer history was later renamed as Handiao Erhuang (汉调二簧), while the newer genre is the topic of this article.

The genre features &quot;bangzi&quot; (wooden clapper) as its accompanying instruments, from which it derives its other names, &quot;Bangzi opera&quot; and luàntán (, literally &quot;hit in chaos&quot;). Bangzi tune is considered one of China&#x27;s Four Great Characteristic Melodies. Qinqiang is the representative of the Bangzi opera and the most important origin of other Bangzi operas. It plays a key role in Chinese traditional culture as its birth and development process is the result of the development of Chinese local opera since ancient times.

==History==

===Terminology===
Qinqiang originated in Shaanxi Province (abbreviated as Qín) of Qing China in 1807 and soon took over other genres to be the representative genre of the province.

Historically, there were two separate genres both referring themselves as Qinqiang, the one with a longer history was later renamed as Handiao Erhuang (汉调二簧). Earlier scholars lumped various genres in Shaanxi Province (&quot;Qin&quot;), including but not restricted to Handiao Erhuang, as Qinqiang; hence, mistakenly they traced such Qinqiang to Qin dynasty (221BC - 206 BC). The epitome of this misconception was Wang Shaoyou (王绍猷)&#x27;s infamous claim in 1949 that Qinqiang &quot;formed in Qin dynasty, refined in Han dynasty, developed in Tang dynasty, completed by Yuan dynasty, reached maturity in Ming dynasty, spread across China in Qin dynasty&quot;. Wang&#x27;s theory was soon debunked in the academia by 程砚秋 and 枣文寿, but the local government and newspaper continued to push the outdated theory.

Scholars state that Qinqiang reflects on the personalities and experiences of the working people, as it was impacted by the war and the influence of Western culture and art. It has been researched by people looking to study the historical and cultural connotations of the Qin dynasty and Tan Dun, the composer for the opera The First Emperor, researched Qinqiang for the opera, in order to learn more about &quot;ancient Chinese vocal styles&quot;.

===Development===

== Music style ==
Qinqiang has four forms of performance: singing, narration, dance, and martial arts. During performances the combination of singing and narrative is used to express other scenes and characters, such as general combat or soldiers attacking enemies on the stage. Supporters of Qiniang state that this creates a unique charm and atmosphere. Actors require a foundation of vocal music, as this is how the character of different humanities is expressed.

==Characters==
There are 13 kinds of characters in Qinqiang including four kinds of &quot;Sheng&quot; (生, male)(老生、須生、小生、幼生), six kinds of &quot;Dan&quot; (旦, female)(老旦、正旦、小旦、花旦、武旦、媒旦), two kinds of &quot;Jing&quot; (淨, painted face male)(大淨、毛淨) and one kind of &quot;Chou&quot; (丑, Clown), also knowns as &quot; 13 Tou Wangzi&quot; (十三頭網子).

==Actors==
*Wei Changsheng

==Artist==
Yang Wenying, a famous artist after the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, and his achievements in the study of Qinqiang Opera art. Yang Wenying is a famous director and actor. He adapted many music works of Qinqiang art to promote the development of modern Qinqiang art in China, such as the modern Qinqiang opera “Red coral”, “Red Lantern”, “Ports” and so on.

==Musical work==
In 1958, Zhao, Zhenxiao and Lu Rilong, professors of Xi&#x27;an Conservatory of Music, created the “Capriccio on a Qinqiang Theme”, which is inspired by Shaanxi Opera, in order to promote the development of national music. The “Capriccio on Qinqiang Theme” is a representative work of the Qingqiang style. This music work is written for Erhu, which is called Chinese violin.

<doc id="618094" wikidata="Q1277428" url="?curid=618094" title="Earl of Surrey">
<text>Earl of Surrey is a title in the Peerage of England that has been created five times. It was first created for William de Warenne, a close companion of William the Conqueror. It is currently held as a subsidiary title by the Dukes of Norfolk.

The chequer arms of the Count of Vermandois were first adopted by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey on his marriage to Elizabeth of Vermandois, Countess of Leicester, daughter to Hugh, Count of Vermandois. Similar arms were also adopted by his brother in law, the famous Crusader Ralph I de Beaugency who had married an older sister, Matilda. These arms continue to be used as the Flag of Surrey.

== History ==
The Earldom of Surrey was first created in 1088 for William de Warenne, as a reward for loyal service to William during the Conquest. He received the lordship of Reigate Castle in Surrey, but also had holdings in twelve other counties. Perhaps because he held little property in Surrey, the earldom came to be more commonly called &quot;of Warenne&quot;. The name Warenne comes from the name of their property in Normandy where the family&#x27;s ancestral castle, Bellencombre, was located on the Varenne River. 
It was held by William de Warenne&#x27;s son and grandson, both also named William, and then by the husbands of Isabella, daughter of the third William de Warenne. The first of these was William of Blois, son of King Stephen, and the second was Hamelin, half-brother of Henry II. The latter took the &quot;de Warenne&quot; surname, and a son, grandson, and great-great-grandson of Hamelin and Isabella subsequently held the earldom. 
With the failure of the second de Warenne male line in 1347, the earldom passed to Richard FitzAlan, 10th Earl of Arundel, who was a nephew of the last de Warenne earl, although he did not assume the title until after the death of the previous earl&#x27;s widow in 1361. It was also held by his son, who forfeited it upon his execution in 1397.

John Holland, who was a grandson of the first Fitzalan earl of Surrey, was then created Duke of Surrey. He held the title for 2 years until he was stripped of it by Henry IV, who restored the earldom to the Fitzalans. The restored earl died in 1415 without male heirs, whereupon the earldom of Surrey became either extinct or abeyant (authorities disagree on this), while the earldom of Arundel passed to his 1st cousin once removed, who was great-grandson of the 9th Earl of Surrey (and consequently also descended from the de Warennes).

The title was revived several times during the 15th century, for John de Mowbray in 1451, and then for Richard of Shrewsbury in 1477. Both died without issue, leaving the title extinct once more.

In 1483 the title was revived for Thomas Howard, who later became Duke of Norfolk, and it has been held by this family ever since (with some breaks during which their titles were forfeited but later restored). The Dukes of Norfolk quarter the de Warrenne arms on their coat of arms. The 4th earl of this creation also inherited the earldom of Arundel, thus re-uniting the two earldoms.

William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey was granted the Manor of Wakefield by the crown and his descendants, the Earls Warenne, inherited it when he died in 1088. The building of Sandal Castle was begun early in the 12th century by William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (1081–1138) who was granted the Sandal estates in 1107 and it became the stronghold of the manor. A second castle was built at Lawe Hill on the north side of the Calder but was abandoned. Wakefield formed the caput of an extensive baronial holding that extended to Cheshire and Lancashire and was held by the Warennes 
until the 14th century, when it passed to Warenne heirs.

== List of titleholders ==
=== Earls of Surrey and Earls of Warenne (1088) ===

The Warenne Earls were called Earl de Warenne at least as often as Earl of Surrey; but they received the &#x27;third penny&#x27; of Surrey, which means that they were entitled to one third of the county court fines. The numbering of the earls follows the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;; some sources number Isabel&#x27;s husbands as the fourth and fifth earls, increasing the numbering of the later earls by one.
* William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey (died 1088)
* William de Warenne, 2nd Earl of Surrey (died 1138), earldom attainted in 1101, restored 1103
* William de Warenne, 3rd Earl of Surrey (1119–1148)
* Isabel de Warenne, Countess of Surrey (died 1203)
** William I, Count of Boulogne, Earl of Surrey (c. 1137–1159), her first husband, younger son of King Stephen of England.
** Hamelin de Warenne, Earl of Surrey (died 1202), her second husband, illegitimate son of Geoffrey of Anjou. He was called Warenne after his marriage. 
* William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey (died 1240)
* John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey (1231–1304) 
* John de Warenne, 7th Earl of Surrey (1286–1347), grandson.

* Richard FitzAlan, 3rd Earl of Arundel, 8th Earl of Surrey (1313–1376), nephew. 
* Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel, 9th Earl of Surrey (1346–1397, forfeited 1397)
* Thomas FitzAlan, 5th Earl of Arundel, 10th Earl of Surrey (1381–1415, restored 1400)

=== Dukes of Surrey (1397) ===
* Thomas Holland, 1st Duke of Surrey (1374–1400, forfeit 1399)

=== Earl of Surrey (1451) ===
* John de Mowbray, 1st Earl of Surrey (1444–1476), nephew of the last FitzAlan earl. Succeeded as 4th Duke of Norfolk in 1461. Title extinct at his death without sons.

=== Earl of Surrey (1477) ===
*Richard of Shrewsbury, younger son of Edward IV, was created Earl of Surrey and Duke of Norfolk on 7 February 1477, when he was three years old. He then married (15 January 1478) Anne Mowbray, only daughter of John de Mowbray above, when both were four. He was one of the Princes in the Tower, and died there at an uncertain date. Titles went extinct upon his death with no heirs.

=== Earls of Surrey (1483) ===
Source:
* Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Surrey (1443–1524), a descendant of Thomas de Mowbray, 1st Duke of Norfolk through a female, Howard was a second cousin of the last Earl. 
**Forfeited in 1485 after the Battle of Bosworth, where his father was killed and attainted. Restored as Earl of Surrey in 1489; created Duke of Norfolk in 1514, and resigned the Earldom to his son on the same day. 
* Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, 2nd Earl of Surrey (1473–1554) Attainted 1547; restored 1553.
** Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey (courtesy title) (1517–1547), the poet; attainted and executed.
* Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, 3rd Earl of Surrey (1536–1572, forfeit at his attainder and execution)
**Philip Howard, 1st Earl of Arundel, (1557–1595), by courtesy Earl of Surrey from 1554 to 1572; inherited the Earldom of Arundel from his mother&#x27;s father in 1580. All his titles were forfeit when he was attainted in 1589. 
* Thomas Howard, 2nd Earl of Arundel, 4th Earl of Surrey (1585–1646, restored 1604), also created Earl of Norfolk in 1644
* Henry Frederick Howard, 3rd Earl of Arundel, 5th Earl of Surrey (1608–1652).
* Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk, 6th Earl of Surrey (1627–1677, restored to the Dukedom of Norfolk in 1660)

The earldom has subsequently always been held by the Duke of Norfolk.

<doc id="618102" wikidata="Q6412137" url="?curid=618102" title="King Watzke">
<text>Alex &quot;King&quot; Watzke (1872-1919) was a violinist and bandleader in New Orleans, Louisiana. His band enjoyed fair popularity ca. 1900-1911 or later. The band played ragtime, popular music, and possibly an early or ancestral version of what later became known as jazz. By 1904 Watzke&#x27;s band&#x27;s repertory included an early version of what later became known as &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; or a similar melody; he and his band called it &quot;Number 2&quot; as Watzke&#x27;s practice was to refer to his compositions by number. As this appears to be the earliest dated reference to &quot;Tiger Rag&quot;, many believe Watzke&#x27;s claim to have been its composer.

Alexander Constantin Watzke, Junior (&quot;King&quot;) was the youngest child of Alexander Constantin Watzke (Senior), a member of the Louisiana State Legislature, and a leader of New Orleans&#x27; German community, who died in 1914. He had several siblings. &quot;King&quot; Watzke was one of the first white bandleaders to take up ragtime and jazz, what had hitherto been primarily African-American musical genres, and thus was responsible for more widely popularizing these musical styles.

Watzke decided to bill himself as &quot;King&quot; after the example of Buddy Bolden. It was reported that he gave coins to children in New Orleans&#x27; French Quarter to announce his coming, &quot;Here comes King Watzke&quot;. Refer to the article: Jazz Royalty

It is believed by some that Watzke and his band, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, were the real-life inspiration for Irving Berlin&#x27;s 1911 song, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;, and the 1938 movie of the same name, &quot;Alexander&#x27;s Ragtime Band&quot;. Even though, for the motion picture, the name and city were changed, the basics of the story appear to ring true, according to family members, and New Orleans jazz history aficionados. The band has also been described as &quot;King Watzke&#x27;s Band&quot; or &quot;Dixieland Band&quot; in the written accounts cited as references.

King Watzke and his band are referred to in a scholarly book by Daniel Hardie, about the history of New Orleans jazz. The following were reported to have been members of the band: Violin or Bass Viol - King Watzke (leader); Trumpet - Jimmy Kendall; Clarinet - Freddie Burns; String Bass - Buzz Harvey, Emile Bigard; Guitar - Jimmy Ruth, Pat Shields. Sometimes Larry Shields (clarinetist) and Ray Lopez (from about 1903–08) played with this band.
Because sound recordings were new in that era, no recordings of Watzke or his band are known to have survived. However, one unlabeled not commercially released &quot;demo&quot; or sample 78 rpm record was known to have been in the hands of surviving family; though it is believed forever lost due to a Gulf Coast hurricane. Also, no photos appear to have survived, even in his family, despite diligent searches.

His father, Alexander Constantin Watzke, Senior, was a successful businessman, in the hide and fur trade, who immigrated to New Orleans from Germany circa 1851; he had served one term in the Louisiana State Legislature and was a leader in the German community of New Orleans; he and his family resided in a large mansion, since demolished, on South Rampart Street. Many family members continue to live in Louisiana and elsewhere in USA, although Alex Jr. is not known to have married, nor left any direct descendants.

Although there had been some uncertainty or controversy about when he died, it has now been established that King Watzke died in 1919, in the Spanish flu pandemic. An obituary was published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and his inscription on the family tombstone in New Orleans suggests a date of death on January 14, 1919. There had been some confusion, however, as an obituary published in the &quot;New Orleans Times-Picayune&quot; referred to the death of another Alexander Watzke almost a decade later, on June 2, 1928, but that person has now been established to have been the nephew of &quot;King&quot; the jazz musician. Alex (King) Watzke is buried in the family grave in the St. Joseph Cemetery in New Orleans.

Jazz aficionados in New Orleans and elsewhere, and the Watzke family worldwide are commemorating the 100th anniversary of the death of King Watzke, the nearly forgotten jazz great of the early days of the genre, in January 2019.

<doc id="618103" wikidata="Q367243" url="?curid=618103" title="Michel-Jean Sedaine">
<text>Michel-Jean Sedaine (2 June 1719 – 17 May 1797) was a French dramatist and librettist, especially noted for his librettos for &quot;opéras comiques&quot;, in which he took an important and influential role in the advancement of the genre from the period of Charles-Simon Favart to the beginning of the Revolution.

==Early life==
Sedaine was born in Paris. His father, an architect, died when Sedaine was quite young and left no fortune to inherit, the young Sedaine therefore began life as a mason&#x27;s labourer. He was at last taken as pupil by an architect whose kindness he eventually repaid, by the help he was able to give to his benefactor&#x27;s grandson, the painter David. Meanwhile, he had done his best to repair his deficiencies of education, and in 1750 he published a &quot;Recueil de pièces fugitives&quot;, which included fables, songs and pastorals.

==Writer of opéras comiques==
Sedaine&#x27;s especial talent was, however, for light opera. He wrote &quot;Le diable à quatre&quot;, set mainly to vaudevilles with additional music by Philidor, Laruette and Baurans. First performed at the Foire Saint-Laurent on 19 August 1756, it was produced numerous times with music by different composers and became one of the most performed comic operas in the latter half of the 18th century.

Other such works followed, including &quot;Blaise le savetier&quot; (1759) with music of Philidor; &quot;On ne s&#x27;avise jamais de tout&quot; (1761) &quot;Aline, reine de Golconde&quot; and others with Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny; &quot;Aucassin et Nicolette&quot; (1780), &quot;Richard Coeur-de-lion&quot; (1784), and &quot;Amphitryon&quot; (1788) with André Grétry.

Among his more important works in the genre were two set by Monsigny: &quot;Le roi et le fermier&quot; (1762), notable for its portrayal of royal recognition of common justice and its 3-act length, and &quot;Le déserteur&quot; (1769), which included a through-composed finale with chorus.

==Work as a dramatist==
Sedaine&#x27;s work in opéra comique attracted the attention of Diderot, and two plays of his were accepted and performed at the Théâtre Français. The first and longest, the &quot;Philosophe sans le savoir&quot;, was acted in 1765; the second, a lively one-act piece, &quot;La gageure imprévue&quot; in 1768. These two at once took their place as stock pieces and are still ranked among the best French plays, each of its class. Except these two pieces little or nothing of his has kept the stage.

He wrote two historical dramas, &quot;Raymond V, comte de Toulouse ou L&#x27;épreuve inutile&quot;, and &quot;Maillard, ou Paris sauvé&quot;.

Sedaine became a member of the Academy (1786), and secretary for architecture of the fine arts division.

==Personal life==
Anne Guéret and her sister Louise Catherine Guéret were orphaned as children but were adopted by Sedaine. He died in Paris in 1797.

==Legacy==
Sedaine may be regarded as the literary ancestor of Scribe and Dumas. He had the practical knowledge of the theatre, which enabled him to carry out the ideas of Diderot and give him claims to be regarded as the real founder of the domestic drama in France.

His &quot;Œuvres&quot; (1826) contain a notice of his life by Ducis.

<doc id="618110" wikidata="Q235586" url="?curid=618110" title="Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)">
<text>Julia Drusilla (Classical Latin: ; middle of AD 39 – 24 January 41), sometimes known as Drusilla the Younger (Classical Latin: ; transcribed as &quot;Drusilla Minor&quot;) during her lifetime, was the only child and daughter of Roman Emperor Gaius (Caligula) and his fourth and last wife Milonia Caesonia. The one-year-old Julia Drusilla was assassinated along with her parents on 24 January 41.

== Life ==
Named after her late aunt and her father&#x27;s favorite sister, Julia Drusilla, Julia was born not long after Caligula married Milonia Caesonia (some sources have her being born on the same day as the marriage). The date of her parents&#x27; marriage has not been determined for certain, but it is known that it was sometime in the summer of AD 39. She had three older half-sisters from her mother&#x27;s previous marriage to an unknown man. When Drusilla was born, Caligula took her to a temple that housed statues of goddesses and placed her on the lap of Minerva, instructing the goddess to nurse and train his new daughter. 

Caligula&#x27;s marriage to Caesonia as relates to Julia Drusilla, their daughter, is subject to dispute by historians. Suetonius states that Caligula loved Caesonia sincerely, passionately, and faithfully, even before the two were married and until the day Caligula died, even though Suetonius is otherwise heavily critical of Caligula&#x27;s romantic and sexual activity. Wood, however, states that the reason for Caligula&#x27;s hasty marriage with the neither young nor beautiful Caesonia was the purported illegitimacy of his daughter: should Caligula marry Julia&#x27;s mother, the child would become his heir. Winterling and Schneider state that the order of events suggests that Caligula did not want to marry until a child of his had already been born, a child who would be the purpose of the union.

Soon after his daughter&#x27;s birth, Caligula set up donation boxes around Rome marked &quot;Julia&#x27;s Drink&quot; or &quot;Julia&#x27;s Food&quot;. According to Suetonius, Caligula believed that Minerva would supervise his daughter&#x27;s growth and education. Suetonius further states that &quot;[Caligula] considered [Drusilla] as his own child for no better reason than her savage temper, which was such even in her infancy, that she would attack with her nails the face and eyes of the children that play with her.&quot; In light of Suetonius&#x27;s condemnation of her father, this appears more as anti-Caligula propaganda and an effort to justify the murder of the child by implying that she inherited the bad qualities of her parent.

== Murder ==
On 24 January 41, Julia Drusilla and her parents were at the imperial palace complex on the Palatine Hill in Rome. A conspiracy to assassinate Caligula and replace him with his uncle Claudius had been in discussion for some time, and this day had been chosen for the assassination. While Caligula was watching an acting troupe of young men rehearsing in the cryptoporticus (underground corridor) for an upcoming performance, as part of a series of games and dramatics held for the Divine Augustus, the Praetorian Guard, led by Cassius Chaerea, rushed Caligula and stabbed him to death. By the time Caligula&#x27;s loyal Germanic guard responded, the emperor was already dead. A few hours later, the Empress Milonia was fatally stabbed by Lupus, a tribune especially sent by Chaerea to murder the two remaining family members. Drusilla was murdered by &quot;having her brains knocked out against a wall.&quot;

=== Aftermath ===
After their murders, all images of Empress Milonia and young Drusilla Minor were destroyed in hopes of making people forget they ever existed, as a sort of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;. Although these once did exist, no sculptures of Milonia and Drusilla survive. Although other, more powerful motives caused the deaths of her parents, Drusilla&#x27;s murder was only justified by her paternity: as Caligula&#x27;s only legitimate child, she could have claimed the throne for her descendants or even for herself. The only surviving image of Drusilla is a coin issued by Herod Agrippa the Great, King of the Jews, that represents Drusilla as a small child sitting next to Victory. The coin reads &quot;to Drusilla, daughter of Augustus.&quot;

== Impact on economy ==
Julia Drusilla&#x27;s birth gave Caligula an additional excuse to impose heavier taxes on the empire for the burden of parenthood. Suetonius quotes him to have complained, &quot;In addition to the burden of sovereignty, I must now shoulder that of fatherhood.&quot; He promptly took up a collection for her education and dowry. Suetonius said that &quot;after the birth of his daughter, complaining of his poverty, and the burdens to which he was subjected, not only as an emperor, but a father, he made a general collection for her maintenance and fortune. He likewise gave public notice, that he would receive new-year&#x27;s gifts on the calends of January following; and accordingly stood in the vestibule of his house, to clutch the presents which people of all ranks threw down before him by handfuls and lapfuls. At last, being seized with an invincible desire of feeling money, taking off his slippers, he repeatedly walked over great heaps of gold coin spread upon the spacious floor, and then laying himself down, rolled his whole body in gold over and over again.&quot;

==Cultural depictions==
She was portrayed by uncredited child actors in the 1976 miniseries &quot;I, Claudius&quot;, the 1979 film &quot;Caligula&quot;, and the third season (2019) of Netflix&#x27;s anthology series &quot;Roman Empire&quot;.

<text>Wilson Kosgei Kipketer (born 12 December 1972) is a Danish former middle distance runner. With a personal best of 1:41.11, Kipketer is tied with Emmanuel Wanyonyi as the second fastest of all time over the 800 meter distance, behind David Rudisha. Kipketer set the world record and broke his own record two more times, all in 1997. He dominated the 800 m distance for a decade, remaining undefeated for a three-year period and running 8 of the 17 currently all-time fastest times. He won gold medals in three successive editions of the IAAF World Championships in Athletics. Though unable to compete in the 1996 Olympics near the peak of his career, he earned silver in 2000 and bronze in 2004. Kipketer&#x27;s 800 meters world record stood for almost 13 years. It was surpassed on 22 August 2010, when David Rudisha beat it by 0.02 seconds, running 1:41.09. Kipketer still currently holds the indoor world record for the 800 metres.

Kipketer represented both Sparta and KIF during his running career.

==Biography==
Kipketer was born in Kapchemoiywo, Kenya, into the Nandi tribe.

As a teenager, he was first noticed by 1968 and 1972 Olympic champion Kip Keino. Keino suggested Kipketer attend the Catholic St. Patrick&#x27;s High School in Iten that was famous for bringing up young runners. David Rudisha, who surpassed Kipketer&#x27;s 800m world record in 2010, was like Kipketer coached by longtime St. Patrick&#x27;s coach, teacher and former Headmaster Brother Colm O&#x27;Connell. Unlike Kipketer, Rudisha did not attend St. Patrick&#x27;s, rather he went to a neighboring St. Francis, Kimuron Secondary School in Iten, Keiyo District.

In 1990, Kipketer travelled to Denmark as a foreign exchange student, studying electronic engineering. He liked Denmark so much that he applied for Danish citizenship. Kipketer came to international attention in 1994 when he won 16 of 18 800 meter races, ran the second fastest 800 meters of the year (1:43.29) and was ranked number one in the world by Track and Field News magazine. The next year, he won 10 of 12 races, ran under 1:43 twice (becoming only the second man to break 1:43 twice in one season, after Joaquim Cruz who did it in 1984 &amp; 1985) with his 1:42.87 being the world leader, and he competed for Denmark in the 1995 World Championships. It was there that he claimed his first World Championship title in the 800 metres, pulling away from his competitors in dominating fashion down the homestretch.

However, Kipketer was not a full Danish citizen, and in 1996 the International Olympic Committee disallowed him from competing for Denmark in the Olympic Games in Atlanta, USA. Despite his absence from the Olympics, there was no doubt that Kipketer was the strongest 800 m runner in the world that year. He remained undefeated throughout 1996, including wins over all three 800 meter medalists at the 1996 Olympic Games, and set a new personal best of 1:41.83 in Rieti at the end of the season, the fastest 800 meter time in the world in 12 years and only 0.1 short of the World Record. Despite not participating in the Olympics, Track &amp; Field News magazine ranked him number one in the world in the 800 meters for 1996.

In 1997 Kipketer was at the peak of his career. In March he won the 800 m gold at the Indoor World Championships in Paris, France. In fact, he broke the indoor world record time in the heats by nearly a second, beating Paul Ereng&#x27;s WR 1:44.84 with his 1:43.96. Then in the final he took yet another second off the world record with a scintillating 1:42.67. On 7 July he tied Sebastian Coe&#x27;s world record (1:41.73) for the 800 metres at a meeting in Stockholm, Sweden. Coe&#x27;s record had stood for sixteen years. He went on to break the record twice that year, the first time being in Zürich, Switzerland at the Weltklasse Zürich GP on 13 August when he ran 1:41.24. (His was one of three world records to fall in a 70-minute stretch at this remarkable meet, the other two being the 5,000 meter record to Haile Gebrselassie and the 3,000 meter steeplechase to Wilson Boit Kipketer. (To the latter, he is not related.) Eleven days later, on 24 August, he improved the world record to 1:41.11 at the Grand Prix meet in Cologne, Germany. On 8 August, in the 1997 World Championships in Athletics at the Olympic Stadium, Athens, Greece, he led the race from start to finish, blazing the first 200 meters in 23.47 seconds, and successfully defended the World Championship title he had won in 1995. He was voted Track &amp; Field Athlete of the Year by Track and Field News Magazine.

The following season, Kipketer contracted malaria and at first intended not to race at all. Eventually, he participated in three meets, winning in Monaco and running a swift 1:43.18 in Zürich. At the European Championships in Budapest but made physical contact with the eventual winner Nils Schumann on the final straight and did not win a medal. He came back in 1999 by finishing second at the Indoor World Championships and bettering that with a gold medal at the 1999 World Championship in Seville, Spain. As in 1997, Kipketer was undefeated in 1999, winning all 10 outdoor races and finishing the year ranked number one in the world in the 800m by Track &amp; Field News magazine.

In 2000, he broke the world indoor record in the 1000 metres by running a 2:14.96. However, he raced sparingly outdoors and didn&#x27;t show the same form he had in previous years, losing three out of the four races he contested. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Kipketer took silver, finishing 0.06 behind Nils Schumann in a tactical, closely contested 800 metres race.

In 2002, Kipketer won the gold medal at the European Championships in Munich, defeating the reigning world champion, André Bucher and 2000 Olympic champion, Nils Schumann. He also won 8 of the 9 races he contested, had the fastest 800-metre time in the world (1:42.32), and ranked number one in the world for 800 metres for a record sixth time (one more than Mal Whitfield).

Despite fighting injuries, Kipketer continued to compete through the 2003 season gaining a silver medal at the Indoor World Championships at the National Indoor Arena, Birmingham, England but only managing fourth place at the World Championships later that year.

In the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece Kipketer had the lead with 80 meters left in the 800 metres final but was passed with 20 meters left by Yuriy Borzakovskiy and Mbulaeni Mulaudzi, Kipketer taking the bronze medal. At 31 years of age he was still running fast times (breaking 1:44 on three occasions) but no longer had the dominant finish he once possessed, winning only one of the six races he contested, and did not race again after 2004. He ended his career with a remarkable record of fast 800 meter times: except for 2001, he ran 1:43 or better every year from 1994 to 2004. His ten years of sub-1:44 800 meter times is unmatched by any other athlete.

During 11 years his coach was Sławomir Nowak (Poland).

He announced his retirement from competitive athletics in August 2005.

==Post-running career==
He married his Danish girlfriend Pernille in 2000 (also a long-distance athlete).

Kipketer owns property in Monaco, Copenhagen, and Eldoret (Kenya). Kipketer has a son born in 2004.

Despite gaining Danish citizenship, Kipketer resides in Monaco. A 1999 article by Associated Press documents that his choice of residence was made for tax reasons.

Kipketer is today a member of the &#x27;Champions for Peace&#x27;, a group of more than 70 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.

<doc id="618113" wikidata="Q572515" url="?curid=618113" title="Havdalah">
<text>Havdalah (, ) is a Jewish religious ceremony that marks the symbolic end of Shabbat and ushers in the new week. The ritual involves lighting a special candle with several wicks, blessing a cup of wine, and smelling sweet spices (). Shabbat ends on Saturday night after the appearance of three stars in the sky. If one forgot or was otherwise not able to recite Havdalah earlier, it may be performed as late as sunset of the Tuesday following Shabbat; however, when it is recited after Saturday night the blessings of the spices and candle are omitted, and only the blessings on the wine and the havdalah itself are recited.
Havdalah is also recited at the conclusion of the biblical holidays.

==Customs==
Like kiddush, havdalah is recited over a cup of kosher wine or grape juice, although other important beverages (&quot;chamar ha-medinah&quot;) may be used if wine or grape juice are not available.

Spices, called &quot;besamim&quot; in Hebrew, often stored in an artistically-decorative spice container in order to beautify and honor the mitzvah, are handed around so that everyone can smell the fragrance. In many Sefardic and Mizrahi communities, branches of aromatic plants are used for this purpose, while Ashkenazi Jews have traditionally used cloves. A special braided havdalah candle with more than one wick is lit, and a blessing is recited. If a special havdalah candle is not available, two candles can be used, and the two flames joined when reciting the blessing.

Either right before or right after reciting the words &quot;,&quot; it is customary for the participants to hold their hands up to the candle and gaze at the reflection of the light in their fingernails. This custom was first recorded in MS ex-Montefiore 134 () and the ().

At the conclusion of Havdalah, some or all of the leftover wine is poured into a small dish and the candle is extinguished in it, as a sign that the candle was lit solely for the mitzvah of Havdalah; some pour directly onto the candle. Based on , &quot;the commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes,&quot; some Jews dip a finger into the leftover wine and touch their eyes or pockets with it. Because it was used for a mitzvah, the wine is considered a &quot;&quot;segulah&quot;,&quot; or good omen.

After the Havdalah ceremony, it is customary to sing &quot;Eliyahu Hanavi&quot; (&quot;Elijah the Prophet&quot;) and/or &quot;HaMavdil Bein Kodesh LeChol&quot; (&quot;Who separates Holy from ordinary/weekday&quot;), and to bless one another with &#x27; (Hebrew) or &#x27; (Yiddish), meaning &quot;Have a good week&quot;.

Havdalah is also recited at the conclusion of the following biblical holidays: Rosh Hashanah; Yom Kippur; the first days (first day in Israel) of Sukkot; Simchat Torah; Passover (&quot;Pesach&quot;), both its first and last days; and Shavuot. It is omitted, however, if the Sabbath falls immediately after the Festival. At the conclusion of a Festival that is not at the conclusion of the Sabbath, on the blessings over the wine and the blessing separating the holy from the everyday, but the spices and the havdalah candle are omitted. At the conclusion of Yom Kippur, when the blessing over the candle is recited, if it was lit from a candle that was lit all of Yom Kippur; when Yom Kippur falls on a weekday, the blessing on spices is not recited, and when it falls on the Sabbath customs differ.

When a major holiday follows Shabbat, the Havdalah service is recited as part of the holiday kiddush and the blessing over spices is not said. The special braided Havdalah candle is not used since it may not be extinguished after the service, but rather the blessing is recited over the festival candles. The prayer &quot;distinguishes holiness from the everyday&quot; is changed to &quot;distinguishes holiness from holiness&quot; signifying that the holiness of the holiday is of a lesser degree than the holiness of the concluded Shabbat.

==Significance==

Havdalah is intended to require a person to use all five senses: feel the cup, smell the spices, see the flame of the candle, hear the blessings and taste the wine.

Following a normal Shabbat, the order of the prayers corresponds to the acrostic יבנ&quot;ה &quot;Yavneh&quot;. This acrostic consists of the initials Yayin (wine), Besamim (spices), Ner (candle), and Havdalah (the Havdalah prayer).

The order of elements when Havdalah is combined with &quot;kiddush&quot; (e.g., on a Saturday night that is &quot;Yom Tov&quot; (&quot;holiday&quot;, literally &quot;Good Day&quot;) is known by the acrostic יקנה&quot;ז &quot;Yaknhaz&quot;. This acrostic consists of the initials Yayin (wine), Kiddush HaYom (blessing the day), Ner (candle), Havdala (the Havdala blessing) and Zman (time, i.e. shehechiyanu). However, when the eighth day of Passover (outside of Israel) falls on Saturday night, the order is יקנ&quot;ה &quot;Yikneh&quot;, since shehechiyanu is never recited on the last days of Passover.

Near the Qaddesh section in some Ashkenazic versions of the Haggadah (e.g. Mantoba 1560, Prague 1526, Venice 1609 and the Goldschmidt Edition), there is a picture of a hunter chasing a hare. This picture is a useful mnemonic for the acrostic יקנה&quot;ז &quot;Yaknhaz&quot; as it can be described by a Yiddish or German sentence that sounds like &quot;Yaknhaz&quot;. The Yiddish sentence יאָג &#x27;ן האָז &quot;yog &#x27;n hoz&quot; means &quot;hunt a/the hare!&quot; (cf. Yiddish יאָג דעם האָז &quot;yog dem hoz&quot;). The colloquial German sentence &quot;Jag &#x27;en Has&quot;&#x27; [jakenhaz] also means &quot;hunt a/the hare!&quot; (cf. German &quot;Jag einen/den Hasen!&quot;).

==Blessings==
The verses recited before Havdalah differ by community. The introductory verses in the Ashkenazic version (beginning הנה אל, &quot;Hinei El&quot;) are taken from the biblical books of Isaiah, Psalms and Esther. In the Sephardic liturgy, the introduction begins with the words ראשון לציון, &quot;Rishon L&#x27;tsion&quot; and consists of biblical verses describing God giving light and success interspersed with later liturgical prose. The Italian Nusach has a third selection of verses. The verses are omitted at the conclusion of Festivals (except when coinciding with the Sabbath), when Havdalah is not recited immediately at the conclusion of the Sabbath (including when Tisha Bav falls on Sunday, and Havdalah is delayed until Sunday night at the conclusion of Tisha Bav), and in the Ashkenazic rite they are omitted also when Havdalah is recited as part of the Synagogue service. The four blessings over the wine, spices, candle and praising God for separation between holy and profane are virtually identical between the traditions. The phrase בין ישראל לעמים, &quot;bein Yisrael l&#x27;amim &quot; &#x27;between Israel and the nations&#x27; is based on . In Reconstructionist Judaism, however, the phrase is omitted, as part of founder Mordechai Kaplan&#x27;s rejection of the Biblical idea of chosenness. Modern tunes for Havdalah are based on melodies by Shlomo Carlebach, Neshama Carlebach and Debbie Friedman.

The Ashkenazi liturgy for havdala after a festival or Shabbat is as follows:

<text>Wild Planet is the second studio album by American new wave band the B-52&#x27;s, released in August 1980 by Warner Bros. (US) and Island Records (Europe, Japan).

As with their first album, the B-52&#x27;s traveled to Compass Point Studios in the Bahamas to record &quot;Wild Planet&quot;. Several of the songs from the album had been concert staples since 1978. The band did not record them for their first album, as they had more songs than could fit in a quality LP record.

Film director Gus Van Sant later referred to the song &quot;Private Idaho&quot; in the title of his 1991 film &quot;My Own Private Idaho&quot; and thanked the band in the film&#x27;s credits, although he did not seek approval from the band to use it.

== Reception ==
=== Critical ===

&quot;Billboard&quot; gave &quot;Wild Planet&quot; a positive review, calling it an improvement over the band&#x27;s debut album and &quot;a cinch for hot rotation in rock-oriented discos&quot;. Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; observed, Party Out of Bounds&#x27; and &#x27;Quiche Lorraine&#x27; are expert entertainments at best and the wacko parochialism of &#x27;Private Idaho&#x27; is a positive annoyance. Only on &#x27;Devil in My Car&#x27; and &#x27;Give Me Back My Man&#x27; do they exploit the potential for meaning—cosmic and emotional, respectively—that accrues to the world&#x27;s greatest new-wave kiddie-novelty disco-punk band.&quot;

Frank Rose of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; felt that it &quot;plainly lacks the relentless exuberance of the group&#x27;s debut disc&quot;, which he considered &quot;partly a result of the production: flatter and duller sounding than its predecessor&quot;. Conversely, &quot;New York Rocker&quot; wrote that &quot;Wild Planet&quot; &quot;does a better job [than the first LP] of capturing Ricky Wilson&#x27;s strangely-tuned riffing and the snap of Keith Strickland&#x27;s drums.&quot; While &quot;Trouser Press&quot; thought the album had its &quot;inspired moments&quot;, they concluded that &quot;too much of the album, with its short length and recycled ideas, comes across as a pale imitation of its predecessor.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, David Cleary thought the songs were &quot;faster, tighter, and punchier than previously, though production values are not as wonderfully quirky and detailed&quot;, and highlighted the &quot;cunning mix of girl group, garage band, surf, and television theme song influences, all propelled along by an itchy dance beat.&quot; In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked &quot;Wild Planet&quot; number 183 on its critics&#x27; list of the 200 greatest albums of the 1980s.

=== Commercial ===
&quot;Wild Planet&quot; charted for 27 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 18. &quot;Wild Planet&quot; was certified Gold by the RIAA.

<doc id="618119" wikidata="Q260168" url="?curid=618119" title="Provability logic">
<text>Provability logic is a modal logic, in which the box (or &quot;necessity&quot;) operator is interpreted as &#x27;it is provable that&#x27;. The point is to capture the notion of a proof predicate of a reasonably rich formal theory, such as Peano arithmetic.

==Examples==
There are a number of provability logics, some of which are covered in the literature mentioned in . The basic system is generally referred to as GL (for Gödel–Löb) or L or K4W (W stands for well-foundedness). It can be obtained by adding the modal version of Löb&#x27;s theorem to the logic K (or K4).

Namely, the axioms of GL are all tautologies of classical propositional logic plus all formulas of one of the following forms: 
* Distribution axiom: 
* Löb&#x27;s axiom: 
And the rules of inference are:
* Modus ponens: From &quot;p&quot; → &quot;q&quot; and &quot;p&quot; conclude &quot;q&quot;;
* Necessitation: From formula_1 &quot;p&quot; conclude formula_1 .

==History==
The GL model was pioneered by Robert M. Solovay in 1976. Since then, until his death in 1996, the prime inspirer of the field was George Boolos. Significant contributions to the field have been made by Sergei N. Artemov, Lev Beklemishev, Giorgi Japaridze, Dick de Jongh, Franco Montagna, Giovanni Sambin, Vladimir Shavrukov, Albert Visser and others.

==Generalizations==
Interpretability logics and Japaridze&#x27;s polymodal logic present natural extensions of provability logic.

<doc id="618120" wikidata="Q1301500" url="?curid=618120" title="Electric power conversion">
<text>In electrical engineering, power conversion is the process of converting electric energy from one form to another.

A power converter is an electrical device for converting electrical energy between alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC). It can also change the voltage or frequency of the current.

Power converters include simple devices such as transformers, and more complex ones like resonant converters. The term can also refer to a class of electrical machinery that is used to convert one frequency of alternating current into another. Power conversion systems often incorporate redundancy and voltage regulation.

Power converters are classified based on the type of power conversion they perform. One way of classifying power conversion systems is based on whether the input and output is alternating or direct current.

==DC power conversion==

===DC to DC===
The following devices can convert DC to DC:
*Linear regulator
*Voltage regulator
*Motor–generator
*Rotary converter
*Switched-mode power supply

===DC to AC===
The following devices can convert DC to AC:
*Power inverter
*Motor–generator
*Rotary converter
*Switched-mode power supply
*Chopper (electronics)

==AC power conversion==

===AC to DC===
The following devices can convert AC to DC:
*Rectifier
*Mains power supply unit (PSU)
*Motor–generator
*Rotary converter
*Switched-mode power supply

===AC to AC===
The following devices can convert AC to AC:
*Transformer or autotransformer
*Voltage converter
*Voltage regulator
*Cycloconverter
*Variable-frequency transformer
*Motor–generator
*Rotary converter
*Switched-mode power supply

==Other systems==
There are also devices and methods to convert between power systems designed for single and three-phase operation.

The standard power voltage and frequency vary from country to country and sometimes within a country. In North America and northern South America, it is usually 120 volts, 60 hertz (Hz), but in Europe, Asia, Africa, and many other parts of the world, it is usually 230 volts, 50 Hz. Aircraft often use 400 Hz power internally, so 50 Hz or 60 Hz to 400 Hz frequency conversion is needed for use in the ground power unit used to power the airplane while it is on the ground. Conversely, internal 400 Hz internal power may be converted to 50 Hz or 60 Hz for convenience power outlets available to passengers during flight.

Certain specialized circuits can also be considered power converters, such as the flyback transformer subsystem powering a CRT, generating high voltage at approximately 15 kHz.

Consumer electronics usually include an AC adapter (a type of power supply) to convert mains-voltage AC current to low-voltage DC suitable for consumption by microchips. Consumer voltage converters (also known as &quot;travel converters&quot;) are used when traveling between countries that use ~120 V versus ~240 V AC mains power. (There are also consumer &quot;adapters&quot; which merely form an electrical connection between two differently shaped AC power plugs and sockets, but these change neither voltage nor frequency.)

==Why use transformers in power converters==

Transformers are used in power converters to incorporate electrical isolation and voltage step-down or step up.

The secondary circuit is floating, when you touch the secondary circuit, you merely drag its potential to your body&#x27;s potential or the earth&#x27;s potential. There will be no current flowing through your body. That&#x27;s why you can use your cellphone safely when it is being charged, even if your cellphone has a metal shell and is connected to the secondary circuit.

Operating at high frequency and supplying low power, power converters have much smaller transformers compared with those of fundamental-frequency, high-power applications.

The current in the primary winding of a transformer help to sets up the mutual flux in accordance with Ampere&#x27;s law and balances the demagnetizing effect of the load current in the secondary winding.

Flyback converter&#x27;s transformer works differently, like an inductor. In each cycle, the flyback converter&#x27;s transformer first gets charged and then releases its energy to the load. Accordingly, the flyback converter&#x27;s transformer air gap has two functions. It not only determines inductance but also stores energy. For the flyback converter, the transformer gap can have the function of energy transmission through cycles of charging and discharging.
:formula_1

The core&#x27;s relative permeability formula_2 can be &gt; 1,000, even &gt; 10,000. While the air gap features much lower permeability, accordingly it has higher energy density.

<doc id="618124" wikidata="Q39940" url="?curid=618124" title="Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Andrew Browne Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, (7 January 1883 – 12 June 1963) was a British officer of the Royal Navy during the Second World War. He was widely known by his initials, &quot;ABC&quot;.

Cunningham was born in Rathmines in the south side of Dublin on 7 January 1883. After starting his schooling in Dublin and Edinburgh, he enrolled at Stubbington House School, at the age of ten. He entered the Royal Navy in 1897 as a naval cadet in the officers&#x27; training ship &quot;Britannia&quot;, passing out in 1898. He commanded a destroyer during the First World War and through most of the interwar period. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order and two Bars, for his performance during this time, specifically for his actions in the Dardanelles and in the Baltics.

In the Second World War, as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet, Cunningham led British naval forces to victory in several critical Mediterranean naval battles. These included the attack on Taranto in 1940, the first completely all-aircraft naval attack in history, and the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. Cunningham controlled the defence of the Mediterranean supply lines through Alexandria, Gibraltar, and the key chokepoint of Malta. He also directed naval support for the various major Allied landings in the Western Mediterranean littoral. In autumn 1943, on the death of the incumbent, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham was promoted to First Sea Lord, the professional head of the Royal Navy, a position he held until his retirement in 1946. He was ennobled as Baron Cunningham of Hyndhope in 1945 and made Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope the following year. After his retirement, Cunningham enjoyed several ceremonial positions, including Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. He died on 12 June 1963, aged 80.

==Childhood==
Cunningham was born at Rathmines, County Dublin, on 7 January 1883, the third of five children born to Professor Daniel John Cunningham and Elizabeth Cumming Browne, both of Scottish ancestry. General Sir Alan Cunningham was his younger brother. His parents were described as having a &quot;strong intellectual and clerical tradition,&quot; both grandfathers having been in the clergy. His father was a Professor of Anatomy at Trinity College Dublin, whilst his mother stayed at home. Elizabeth Browne, with the aid of servants and governesses, oversaw much of his upbringing; as a result he reportedly had a &quot;warm and close&quot; relationship with her.

After a short introduction to schooling in Dublin he was sent to Edinburgh Academy, where he stayed with his aunts Doodles and Connie May. At the age of ten he received a telegram from his father asking &quot;would you like to go into the Navy?&quot; At the time, the family had no maritime connections, and Cunningham only had a vague interest in the sea. Nevertheless, he replied &quot;Yes, I should like to be an Admiral&quot;. He was then sent to a Naval Preparatory School, Stubbington House, which specialised in sending pupils through the entrance examinations. Cunningham passed the exams, showing particular strength in mathematics.

==Early naval career==

Along with 64 other boys Cunningham joined the Royal Navy as a cadet aboard the training ship &quot;Britannia&quot; at Dartmouth on 15 January 1897. One of his classmates was future Admiral of the Fleet Sir James Somerville. Cunningham was known for his lack of enthusiasm for field sports, although he did enjoy golf and spent most of his spare time &quot;messing around in boats&quot;. He said in his memoirs that by the end of his course he was &quot;anxious to seek adventure at sea&quot;. Although he committed numerous minor misdemeanours, he still obtained a &quot;very good&quot; for conduct. He passed out tenth in April 1898, with first class marks for mathematics and seamanship.

His first service was as a midshipman on in 1899, serving at the Cape of Good Hope Station when the Second Boer War began. By February 1900, he had transferred into the Naval Brigade as he believed &quot;this promised opportunities for bravery and distinction in action.&quot; Cunningham then saw action at Pretoria and Diamond Hill as part of the Naval Brigade. He then went back to sea, as midshipman in in December 1901. The following November he joined the protected cruiser . Beginning in 1902, Cunningham took sub-lieutenant courses at Portsmouth and Greenwich; he served as sub-lieutenant on the battleship , in the Mediterranean, for six months in 1903. In September 1903, he was transferred to to serve as second-in-command. He was promoted to lieutenant in 1904, and served on several vessels during the next four years. In 1908, he was awarded his first command, HM Torpedo Boat No. 14.

==First World War==
 Cunningham was a highly decorated officer during the First World War, receiving the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and two bars. In 1911 he was given command of the destroyer , which he commanded throughout the war. In 1914, &quot;Scorpion&quot; was involved in the shadowing of the German battlecruiser and cruiser &quot;Goeben&quot; and &quot;Breslau&quot;. This operation was intended to find and destroy the &quot;Goeben&quot; and the &quot;Breslau&quot; but the German warships evaded the British fleet, and passed through the Dardanelles to reach Constantinople. Their arrival contributed to the Ottoman Empire joining the Central Powers in November 1914. Although a bloodless &quot;battle&quot;, the failure of the British pursuit had enormous political and military ramifications; in the words of Winston Churchill, they brought &quot;more slaughter, more misery and more ruin than has ever before been borne within the compass of a ship.&quot;

Cunningham stayed on in the Mediterranean and in 1915 &quot;Scorpion&quot; was involved in the attack on the Dardanelles. For his performance, Cunningham was rewarded with promotion to commander in July 1915. He was also awarded the Distinguished Service Order, gazetted in March 1916. Cunningham spent much of 1916 on routine patrols. In late 1916, he was engaged in convoy protection, a duty he regarded as mundane. He had no contact with German U-boats during this time, on which he commented; &quot;The immunity of my convoys was probably due to sheer luck&quot;. Convinced that the Mediterranean held few offensive possibilities he requested to sail for home. &quot;Scorpion&quot; paid off on 21 January 1918. In his seven years as captain of the &quot;Scorpion&quot;, Cunningham had developed a reputation for first class seamanship. He was transferred by Vice-Admiral Roger Keyes to , part of Keyes&#x27; Dover Patrol, in April 1918. For his actions with the Dover Patrol, he was awarded a bar to his DSO the following year.

==Interwar years==
===Association with Cowan===
Cunningham saw much action in the interwar years. In 1919, he commanded the S-class destroyer , on duty in the Baltic. The Communists, the White Russians, several varieties of Latvian nationalists and the Germans were trying to control Latvia; the British Government had recognised Latvia&#x27;s independence after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. It was on this voyage that Cunningham first met Admiral Walter Cowan. Cunningham was impressed by Cowan&#x27;s methods, specifically his navigation of the potentially dangerous seas, with thick fog and minefields threatening the fleet.

Throughout several potentially problematic encounters with German forces trying to undermine the Latvian independence movement, Cunningham exhibited &quot;good self control and judgement&quot;. Cowan was quoted as saying &quot;Commander Cunningham has on one occasion after another acted with unfailing promptitude and decision, and has proved himself an Officer of exceptional valour and unerring resolution.&quot;

He was promoted to the rank of captain, effective 31 December 1919. For his actions in the Baltic, Cunningham was awarded a second bar to his DSO, gazetted in March 1920. His first appointment as a Captain was President of the Naval Inter-Allied Commission of Control in Heligoland. On his return from the Baltic in 1922, he was appointed captain of the 6th Destroyer Flotilla, then the 1st Destroyer Flotilla later in the year, and the naval base, , at Port Edgar in the Firth of Forth, from 1924 to 1926. Cunningham renewed his association with Vice Admiral Cowan between 1926 and 1928, when Cunningham was flag captain and chief staff officer to Cowan while serving on the North America and West Indies Squadron, based at the Royal Naval Dockyard in the Imperial fortress colony of Bermuda, with shore headquarters at Admiralty House in Pembroke. In his memoirs Cunningham made clear the &quot;high regard&quot; in which he held Cowan, and the many lessons he learned from him during their two periods of service together.

The late 1920s found Cunningham back in the UK participating in courses at the Army&#x27;s Senior Officers&#x27; School at Sheerness, as well as at the Imperial Defence College. While Cunningham was at the Imperial Defence College, in 1929, he married Nona Byatt (daughter of Horace Byatt, MA; the couple had no children). After a year at the College, Cunningham was given command of his first big ship; the battleship . Eighteen months later, he was appointed commodore of , the Royal Naval Barracks, Chatham.

===Promoted to flag rank===

In September 1932, Cunningham was promoted to flag rank, and aide-de-camp to the King. He was appointed Rear Admiral (Destroyers) in the Mediterranean in December 1933 and was made a Companion of the Bath in 1934. Having hoisted his flag in the light cruiser , Cunningham used his time to practise fleet handling for which he was to receive much praise in the Second World War. There were also fleet exercises in the Atlantic Ocean in which he learnt the skills and values of night actions that he would also use to great effect in years to come.

On his promotion to vice admiral in July 1936, due to the interwar naval policy, further active employment seemed remote. However, a year later due to the illness of Sir Geoffrey Blake, Cunningham assumed the combined appointment of commander of the Battlecruiser Squadron and second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet, with as his flagship. After his long service in small ships, Cunningham considered his accommodation aboard &quot;Hood&quot; to be almost palatial, even surpassing his previous big ship experience on &quot;Rodney&quot;.

He retained command until September 1938, when he was appointed to the Admiralty as Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, although he did not actually take up this post until December 1938. He accepted this shore job with reluctance since he loathed administration, but the Board of Admiralty&#x27;s high regard of him was evident. For six months during an illness of Admiral Sir Roger Backhouse, the then First Sea Lord, he deputised for Backhouse on the Committee of Imperial Defence and on the Admiralty Board. In 1939 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), becoming known as Sir Andrew Cunningham.

==Second World War==
Cunningham described the command of the Mediterranean Fleet as &quot;The finest command the Royal Navy has to offer&quot; and he remarked in his memoirs that &quot;I probably knew the Mediterranean as well as any Naval Officer of my generation&quot;. Cunningham was made Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, hoisting his flag in on 6 June 1939, one day after arriving in Alexandria on 5 June 1939. As Commander-in-Chief, Cunningham&#x27;s main concern was for the safety of convoys heading for Egypt and Malta. These convoys were highly significant in that they were desperately needed to keep Malta, a small British colony and naval base, in the war. Malta was a strategic strongpoint and Cunningham fully appreciated this. Cunningham believed that the main threat to British sea power in the Mediterranean would come from the Italian Fleet. As such Cunningham had his fleet at a heightened state of readiness, so that when Italy did choose to enter into hostilities the British Fleet would be ready.

===French Surrender (June 1940)===

In his role as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, Cunningham had to negotiate with the French Admiral René-Émile Godfroy for the demilitarisation and internment of the Force X, the French squadron at Alexandria, in June 1940, following the Fall of France. Churchill had ordered Cunningham to prevent the French warships from leaving port, and to ensure that French warships did not pass into enemy hands. Stationed at the time at Alexandria, Cunningham entered into delicate negotiations with Godfroy to ensure his fleet, which consisted of the battleship , four cruisers, three destroyers and a submarine, posed no threat. The Admiralty ordered Cunningham to complete the negotiations on 3 July.

Just as an agreement seemed imminent Godfroy heard of the British action against the French at Mers el Kebir and, for a while, Cunningham feared a battle between French and British warships in the confines of Alexandria harbour. The deadline was overrun but negotiations ended well, after Cunningham put them on a more personal level and had the British ships appeal to their French opposite numbers.

Cunningham&#x27;s negotiations succeeded and the French emptied their fuel bunkers and removed the firing mechanisms from their guns. Cunningham in turn promised to repatriate the ships&#x27; crews.

===Battle of Taranto (November 1940)===

Although the threat from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of the threat posed by the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, considerably upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious problem. At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, had drawn up Operation &quot;Judgement&quot;; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join in Cunningham&#x27;s fleet.

The attack started at 21:00, 11 November 1940, when the first of two waves of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers took off from &quot;Illustrious&quot;, followed by the second wave an hour later. The attack was a great success: the Italian fleet lost half its strength in one night. The &quot;fleet-in-being&quot; diminished in importance and the threat to the Royal Navy&#x27;s control of the Mediterranean had been considerably reduced. Cunningham said of the victory: &quot;Taranto, and the night of 11–12 November 1940, should be remembered for ever as having shown once and for all that in the Fleet Air Arm the Navy has its most devastating weapon.&quot; The Royal Navy had launched the first all-aircraft naval attack in history, flying a small number of aircraft from an aircraft carrier. This, and other aspects of the raid, were important facts in the planning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941: the Japanese planning staff were thought to have studied it intensively.

Cunningham&#x27;s official reaction at the time was memorably terse. After landing the last of the attacking aircraft, &quot;Illustrious&quot; signalled &quot;Operation Judgement executed&quot;. After seeing aerial reconnaissance photographs the next day which showed several Italian ships sunk or out of action, Cunningham replied with the two-letter code group which signified, &quot;Manoeuvre well executed&quot;.

===Battle of Cape Matapan (March 1941)===

At the end of March 1941, Hitler wanted the convoys supplying the British Expeditionary force in Greece stopped, and the Italian Navy was the only force able to attempt this. Cunningham stated in his biography: &quot;I myself was inclined to think that the Italians would not try anything. I bet Commander Power, the Staff Officer, Operations, the sum of ten shillings that we would see nothing of the enemy.&quot;

Under pressure from Germany, the Italian Fleet planned to launch an attack on the British Fleet on 28 March 1941. The Italian commander, Admiral Angelo Iachino, intended to carry out a surprise attack on the British Cruiser Squadron in the area (commanded by Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Pridham-Wippell), executing a pincer movement with the battleship . Cunningham though, was aware of Italian naval activity through intercepts of Italian Enigma messages. Although Italian intentions were unclear, Cunningham&#x27;s staff believed an attack upon British troop convoys was likely and orders were issued to spoil the enemy plan and, if possible, intercept their fleet. Cunningham wished, however, to disguise his own activity and arranged for a game of golf and a fictitious evening gathering to mislead enemy agents (he was, in fact, overheard by the local Japanese Consul).

After sunset, he boarded HMS &quot;Warspite&quot; and left Alexandria. Cunningham, realising that an air attack could weaken the Italians, ordered an attack by the &#x27;s Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave the order to pursue the Italian Fleet.

An air attack from the &quot;Formidable&quot; had disabled the cruiser , and Iachino, unaware of Cunningham&#x27;s pursuing battlefleet, ordered a squadron of cruisers and destroyers to return and protect the &quot;Pola&quot;. Cunningham, meanwhile, was joining up with Pridham-Wippell&#x27;s cruiser squadron. Throughout the day several chases and sorties occurred with no overall victor. None of the Italian ships were equipped for night fighting, and when night fell, they made to return to Taranto. The British battlefleet equipped with radar detected the Italians shortly after 22:00. In a pivotal moment in naval warfare during the Second World War, the battleships , and &quot;Warspite&quot; opened fire on two Italian cruisers at only 3,800 yards (3.5 km), destroying them in only five minutes.

Although the &quot;Vittorio Veneto&quot; escaped from the battle by returning to Taranto, there were many accolades given to Cunningham for continuing the pursuit at night, against the advice of his staff. After the previous defeat at Taranto, the defeat at Cape Matapan dealt another strategic blow to the Italian Navy. Five ships—three heavy cruisers and two destroyers—were sunk, and around 2,400 Italian sailors were killed, missing or captured. The British lost only three aircrew when one torpedo bomber was shot down. Cunningham had lost his bet with Commander Power but he had won a strategic victory in the war in the Mediterranean. The defeats at Taranto and Cape Matapan meant that the Italian Navy did not intervene in the heavily contested evacuations of Greece and Crete, later in 1941. It also ensured that, for the remainder of the war, the Regia Marina conceded the Eastern Mediterranean to the Allied Fleet, and did not leave port for the remainder of the war.

===Battle of Crete (May 1941)===

On the morning of 20 May 1941, Nazi Germany launched an airborne invasion of Crete, under the code-name &quot;Unternehmen Merkur&quot; (Operation Mercury). Despite initial heavy casualties, Maleme airfield in western Crete fell to the Germans and enabled them to fly in heavy reinforcements and overwhelm the Allied forces.

After a week of heavy fighting, British commanders decided that the situation was hopeless and ordered a withdrawal from Sfakia. During the next four nights, 16,000 troops were evacuated to Egypt by ships (including of Battle of the River Plate fame). A smaller number of ships were to withdraw troops on a separate mission from Heraklion, but these ships were attacked en route by Luftwaffe dive bombers. Without air cover, Cunningham&#x27;s ships suffered serious losses. Cunningham was determined, though, that the &quot;navy must not let the army down&quot;, and when army generals feared he would lose too many ships, Cunningham said,

The &quot;never say die&quot; attitude of Cunningham and the men under his command meant that of 22,000 men on Crete, 16,500 were rescued but at the loss of three cruisers and six destroyers. Fifteen other major warships were damaged.

===Allied Expeditionary Force (1942–43)===
Cunningham became a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), &quot;in recognition of the recent successful combined operations in the Middle East&quot;, in March 1941 and was created a baronet, of Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in the County of Southampton, in July 1942. From late 1942 to early 1943, he served under General Dwight D. Eisenhower, who made him Naval Commander, Allied Expeditionary Force. In this role Cunningham commanded the large fleet that covered the Anglo-American landings in North Africa (Operation Torch). General Eisenhower said of him in his diary:

On 21 January 1943, Cunningham was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet. February 1943 saw him return to his post as Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. Three months later, when Axis forces in North Africa were on the verge of surrender, he ordered that none should be allowed to escape. Entirely in keeping with his fiery character he signalled the fleet &quot;Sink, burn and destroy: Let nothing pass&quot;. He oversaw the naval forces used in the joint Anglo-American amphibious invasions of Sicily, during Operation Husky, Operation Baytown and Operation Avalanche. On the morning of 11 September 1943, Cunningham was present at Malta when the Italian Fleet surrendered. Cunningham informed the Admiralty with a telegram; &quot;Be pleased to inform their Lordships that the Italian battle fleet now lies at anchor under the guns of the fortress of Malta.&quot;

===First Sea Lord (1943-46)===
In October 1943, Cunningham became First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff, after the death of Sir Dudley Pound. This promotion meant that he had to relinquish his coveted post of Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, recommending Admiral John H. D. Cunningham as his successor. In the position of First Sea Lord, and as a member of the Chiefs of Staff committee, Cunningham was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the navy for the remainder of the war. He attended the major conferences at Cairo, Tehran, Yalta and Potsdam, at which the Allies discussed future strategy, including the invasion of Normandy and the deployment of a British fleet to the Pacific Ocean.

While the port of Antwerp was vital for the Allies after D-Day, Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF and Montgomery that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery postponed the Battle of the Scheldt, and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.

==Retirement==

In January 1945 Cunningham was appointed a Knight of the Thistle and raised to the peerage as Baron Cunningham of Hyndhope, of Kirkhope in the County of Selkirk. He was entitled to retire at the end of the war in 1945 but he resolved to pilot the Navy through the transition to peace before retiring. With the election of Clement Attlee as British Prime Minister in 1945, and the implementation of his Post-war consensus, there was a large reduction in the Defence Budget. The extensive reorganisation was a challenge for Cunningham. &quot;We very soon came to realise how much easier it was to make war than to reorganise for peace.&quot; Due to pressures on the budget from all three services, the Navy embarked on a reduction programme that was larger than Cunningham had envisaged.

In October 1945, he was elected Rector of the University of Edinburgh. He was made Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope, of Kirkhope in the County of Selkirk, in the 1946 New Year Honours, and appointed to the Order of Merit in June of that year. At the end of May 1946, after overseeing the transition through to peacetime, Cunningham retired from his post as First Sea Lord. Cunningham retreated to the &quot;little house in the country&quot;, &#x27;Palace House&#x27;, at Bishop&#x27;s Waltham in Hampshire, which he and Lady Cunningham had acquired before the war. They both had a busy retirement. He attended the House of Lords irregularly and occasionally lent his name to press statements about the Royal Navy, particularly those relating to Admiral Dudley North, who had been relieved of his command of Gibraltar in 1940. Cunningham, and several of the surviving admirals of the fleet, set about securing justice for North, and they succeeded with a partial vindication in 1957.

He busied himself with various appointments; he was Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1950 and 1952, and in 1953 he acted as Lord High Steward at the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Throughout this time Cunningham and his wife entertained family and friends, including his own great nephew, Jock Slater, in their extensive gardens. Cunningham died in London on 12 June 1963, and was buried at sea off Portsmouth. There were no children from his marriage and his titles consequently became extinct on his death.

A bust of Cunningham by Franta Belsky was unveiled in Trafalgar Square in London on 2 April 1967 by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.

The April 2010 UK naval operation to ship British military personnel and air passengers stranded in continental Europe by the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption back to the UK was named Operation Cunningham after him.

<text>The Alpilles ( , ) is a small range of low mountains in Provence, southern France, located about south of Avignon.

==Geography==

The range is an extension of the much larger Luberon range. Although it is not high – some 498 m (1,634 ft) at its highest point – the Alpilles range stands out impressively, as it rises abruptly from the Rhône valley and from the very flat alluvial plain of Crau. The range is about 25 km long by about 8 to 10 km wide, running in an east–west direction between the Rhône and Durance rivers. The landscape of the Alpilles is one of arid limestone peaks separated by dry valleys.

==Communes==
The Chaîne des Alpilles is part of the territory of 15 communes: Aureille, Les Baux-de-Provence, Eygalières, Eyguières, Fontvieille, Mas-Blanc-des-Alpilles, Maussane-les-Alpilles, Mouriès, Paradou, Orgon, Saint-Étienne-du-Grès, Saint-Martin-de-Crau, Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, Sénas, Tarascon.

==Flora and fauna==

The lower slopes are planted with olive and almond trees. Kermes oaks and pines also grow there. Much of the range is bare rock or stony ground covered with scrub and maquis.

The highest parts of the range are a nature reserve inhabited by a number of rare species, including Bonelli&#x27;s eagle, the Egyptian vulture and eagle owl. .

==History==
Some protohistorical settlements have been found in the Alpilles. In the very old village of Les Baux de Provence, a cave was used 8000 years ago.

==Conservation==
The Parc Naturel Régional des Alpilles was created on January 30, 2007. It covers the territory of 16 communes. The area is also under the protection of the Natura 2000 Environmental Protection Plan of the European Union.

==The Alpilles in arts==

The Alpilles were immortalized in art by Vincent van Gogh, who painted many images of the Alpilles&#x27; landscapes during his time in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence on the north side of the mountains. One of the paintings was given by van Gogh to his friend Eugène Boch.

Alphonse Daudet&#x27;s 1885 novel &quot;Tartarin sur les Alpes&quot;, which is a sequel to the 1872 &quot;Tartarin de Tarascon&quot;, takes place in the Alpilles.

<text>Paul Quinichette (May 17, 1916 – May 25, 1983) was an American jazz tenor saxophonist. He was known as the &quot;Vice President&quot; or &quot;Vice Prez&quot; for his emulation of the breathy style of Lester Young, whose nickname was &quot;The President&quot;, or simply &quot;Prez&quot;. Young called Quinichette &quot;Lady Q&quot;.

==Early life==
Quinichette was born in Denver, Colorado. He had clarinet and alto saxophone lessons as a child, before switching to tenor saxophone. Around the age of 13, he had informal lessons from Lester Young. Quinichette attended Denver University, transferred to Tennessee State College, and then returned to Denver University, from which he graduated in music. While in college he played with local bands, and during summer vacations he toured with Nat Towles and the trumpeter Lloyd Hunter.

==Later life and career==
Quinichette worked with Shorty Sherock in the late 1930s, and was then with Ernie Fields (1942), and Jay McShann (1942–43). He was with Johnny Otis on the West Coast from 1945 to 1947, then went to New York with Louis Jordan in 1947. In New York he played with various musicians before joining Count Basie in 1951. After two years with Basie, and buoyed by the success of his own recordings for EmArcy Records, Quinichette left to form his own band.

In the mid to late 1950s, Quinichette also accompanied vocalist Dinah Washington on EmArcy recordings, and played with Benny Goodman and Nat Pierce (both 1955), John Coltrane (1957), and Billie Holiday. In the following decade, poor health hindered his activities as a musician, and he took work as an electrical engineer. Although still restricted, he resumed performing in 1973. 

Quinichette died in New York City on May 25, 1983.

==Playing style==
&quot;Grove&quot; comments that &quot;Quinichette&#x27;s style displayed a sense of swing unequaled among those musicians who followed Young.&quot; Writing in 1959, critic John S. Wilson stated that, after leaving Basie, &quot;Quinichette has inclined to a coarseness of tone and ideas and an attack that stems as much from the less palatable side of Illinois Jacquet as it does from Young.&quot;

<text>Comics and Sequential Art is a book by American cartoonist Will Eisner that analyzes the comics medium, published in 1985 and revised in 1990. It is based on a series of essays that appeared in &quot;The Spirit&quot; magazine, themselves based on Eisner&#x27;s experience teaching a course on comics at the School of Visual Arts. It is not presented as a teaching guide, however, but as a series of demonstrations of principles and methods. A 1990 expanded edition of the book includes short sections on the print process and the use of computers in comics. Eisner followed with a companion volume, &quot;Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative&quot;, in 1996.

==Content==

In contrast to earlier books on comics, which focused on specific aspects such as drawing anatomy, Eisner&#x27;s book takes an overall approach, devoting different chapters to different aspects of comics. To demonstrate many of the concepts the book introduces, Eisner provides a ten-page adaptation of the &quot;To be, or not to be...&quot; soliloquy from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot;. A revised edition included a chapter on computer techniques.

==Publication history==

Since the 1970s Eisner had been lecturing on comics at the School of Visual Arts. He was unable to find a textbook that focused on theoretical aspects of comics, and began writing essays based on the subject for &quot;The Spirit&quot; magazine; these essays came to form the basis of &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot;.

==Legacy==

Along with Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Comics&quot; (1993), &quot;Comics and Sequential Art&quot; is considered to form the foundations for formal comics studies in English. Eisner followed up the book in different ways: he expanded the &quot;Expressive Anatomy&quot; chapter into a book with the same title two decades later, and followed up the book itself with &quot;Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative&quot; in 1996.

<text>The Rideau Club is a private social club in Ottawa, Ontario. The club was founded in 1865 by Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir George-Étienne Cartier as a gentlemen&#x27;s club, but since 1979 has been mixed-sex. For much of its history the club was populated primarily by parliamentarians. In 1876 the Rideau built its clubhouse at 84 Wellington Street, where it remained until the building burned down in 1979. Since the fire, the club has been located in the top floor of the Metropolitan Life Building at 99 Bank Street.

== History ==

The club building, located for years across the street from the Parliament Buildings, burned down in October 1979. The club is now located on the top floor of a downtown office tower on Bank Street. At the time of the fire, the Government of Canada was attempting to expropriate the club&#x27;s property to serve as part of a future U.S. embassy.

It was reported to be the first club in Canada (and one of the first in North America) to disallow the use of the blackball tradition which allowed clubs to subtly discriminate against Jewish potential members, after succumbing to pressure from Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, among others, to admit Louis Rasminsky, Governor of the Bank of Canada.

Similarly, in the 1970s, after seeing controversy over its all-male policy, the club allowed female members and at the same time removed restrictions on female guests. The lounge, located on the north side of the club, is named after its first female member, Jean Pigott. She was accepted to the Rideau Club in 1979, the same year as the fire.

Each room on the south side of the club is dedicated to a significant person in Canadian history. Most are named after former prime ministers of Canada, but one is named after Yousuf Karsh. It is filled with famous portraits taken by him and left to the Rideau Club after his death.

<doc id="618149" wikidata="Q270639" url="?curid=618149" title="John McTiernan">
<text>John Campbell McTiernan Jr. (born January 8, 1951) is an American former filmmaker. He is best known for his action films, including &quot;Predator&quot; (1987), &quot;Die Hard&quot; (1988), and &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; (1990). The last three of his 11 feature films, ending with &quot;Basic&quot; (2003), were critical and box office failures. 

He pleaded guilty in 2006 to lying to an FBI investigator; the judgment was vacated, after which he pleaded guilty in 2007 to the original charge and an additional charge of perjury, in regard to his hiring of the private investigator Anthony Pellicano in late 2000 to illegally wiretap the phone calls of two people, one of whom was Charles Roven, a co-producer of his action film remake &quot;Rollerball&quot; (2002). He was incarcerated in federal prison from April 2013 to February 2014. During his imprisonment, he filed for bankruptcy amidst foreclosure proceedings for his large ranch residence. He did not return to directing feature films after his run of failed films, his time dealing with the courts, and serving his prison sentence; in 2017, he directed an advertisement for a video game release.

==Early life and education==
McTiernan was born in Albany, New York, the son of Myra and John Campbell McTiernan Sr., a lawyer and actor. He attended the Juilliard School before graduating with a Master of Fine Arts from the AFI Conservatory in 1975. John McTiernan is an alum from SUNY Old Westbury.

==Career==
===1980s===
In 1986, McTiernan wrote and directed his first feature film, &quot;Nomads&quot;, starring Pierce Brosnan (Brosnan&#x27;s first lead role in a film). It was not well received by critics, receiving 36% on the review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 1.5 stars out of four and said that even if viewers cared about the characters, the film is too confusing to understand. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Nomads&quot; avoids the more obvious ripped-guts devices in favor of dramatic visual scares. [...] In fact, everything seems to come naturally in a tale that even has the supernatural ring true.&quot; Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the Innuat &quot;as menacing as the chorus from &quot;West Side Story&quot;&quot;. In his memoir, &quot;Total Recall&quot;, Arnold Schwarzenegger said he was so impressed by the film&#x27;s tense atmosphere made with a low budget that he hired McTiernan to direct &quot;Predator&quot;.

The budget for sci-fi &quot;Predator&quot; was around $15m. It opened as #1 at the U.S. box office with a gross of $12m on just its opening weekend, and went on to gross nearly $100m overall. In 1987, its domestic grosses were second only to &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot;. Initial critical reaction to &quot;Predator&quot; was negative, with criticism focusing on the thin plot. Metacritic, which assigns a score out of 100 to reviews, rates the film with an average score of 45 based on 15 reviews, with the review opinions summarized as &quot;mixed&quot;. Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described it as &quot;grisly and dull, with few surprises&quot;. Dean Lamanna wrote in &quot;Cinefantastique&quot; that &quot;the militarized monster movie tires under its own derivative weight.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was a &quot;slightly above-average actioner that tries to compensate for tissue-thin plot with ever-more-grisly death sequences and impressive special effects.&quot; However, in subsequent years critics&#x27; attitudes toward the film warmed, and it has appeared on &quot;best of&quot; lists. The review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes reports that 78% of 40 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review.

Made on a $28m budget, &quot;Die Hard&quot; went on to gross over $140m theatrically worldwide. It is considered one of the greatest action films. The film&#x27;s success spawned a &quot;Die Hard&quot; franchise, which so far has included four sequels, video games, and a comic book. It received very high ratings from critics. English film critic Mark Kermode expressed admiration for the film, calling it an exciting setup of &quot;Cowboys and Indians in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot;&quot;. The film has been included in various top-ten lists of best Christmas movies, including &quot;Empire&quot; (rating it #1), &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; (rating it #4), &quot;Forbes&quot; (rating it #1), &quot;The Guardian&quot; (rating it #8), and &quot;San Francisco Gate&quot; (rating it #1). However, not every critic praised it. Roger Ebert gave it a mere two stars out of four and criticized the stupidity of the deputy police chief character Dwayne T. Robinson (played by Paul Gleason), saying that &quot;all by himself he successfully undermines the last half of the movie&quot;.

===1990–1995===
&quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; also received positive reviews from critics. Nick Schager, for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, called the film &quot;a thrilling edge-of-your-seat trifle that has admirably withstood the test of time&quot;. Ebert called it &quot;a skillful, efficient film that involves us in the clever and deceptive game being played&quot;, while Gene Siskel commented on the film&#x27;s technical achievement and Baldwin&#x27;s convincing portrayal of the character Jack Ryan.

McTiernan directed &quot;Medicine Man&quot; (1992), about a medical researcher in a rainforest, starring Sean Connery. &quot;Medicine Man&quot; was poorly received. Roger Ebert gave it one-and-a-half stars, saying that although the film had &quot;some beautiful moments&quot;, it never really came together and had &quot;a cornball conclusion&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said the story was &quot;built around some very tired devices&quot; and especially criticized the performance of the female lead.

In 1993, he directed and co-produced &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, an action-comedy vehicle for Arnold Schwarzenegger. The film received mixed to negative reviews from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said it was &quot;a stupid, generic slab of action bombast that keeps reminding us it&#x27;s a stupid, generic slab of action bombast&quot; and called it &quot;a lead balloon of a movie&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; called it a &quot;a joyless, soulless machine of a movie, an $80 million-plus mishmash&quot;. Vincent Canby likened the film to &quot;a two-hour &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch&quot; and called it &quot;something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, writing that despite some entertaining moments &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; more often &quot;plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through&quot;.

In 1995, McTiernan rebounded with &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot;, the third installment of the &quot;Die Hard&quot; film series. It was highly successful garnering $366m in box office receipts and becoming the highest-grossing film of the year, although the film had mixed reviews by critics. Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that while &quot;McTiernan stages individual sequences with great finesse... they don&#x27;t add up to a taut, dread-ridden whole.&quot; James Berardinelli said the explosions and fights were &quot;filmed with consummate skill, and are thrilling in their own right.&quot; Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said &quot;the best thing about the movie is the relationship between McClane and Zeus&quot;, saying that Samuel L. Jackson was &quot;almost as good as he was in &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Ebert gave the film a positive review, praising the action sequences and the performances of Willis, Jackson, and Jeremy Irons, concluding: &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; is basically a wind-up action toy, cleverly made, and delivered with high energy. It delivers just what it advertises, with a vengeance.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ian Nathan gave the film a 3/5-star review stating that &quot;&quot;Die Hard With A Vengeance&quot; is better than &quot;Die Hard 2&quot;, but not as good as the peerless original. Though it&#x27;s breathless fun, the film runs out of steam in the last act. And Jeremy Irons&#x27; villain isn&#x27;t fit to tie Alan Rickman&#x27;s shoelaces.&quot;

===Later career===
From 1995 to 1997, McTiernan was a producer for several smaller projects, including at least three films that were not major releases &quot;The Right to Remain Silent&quot; (a made-for-television film), &quot;Amanda&quot;, and &quot;Quicksilver Highway&quot; (a made-for-television film).

He directed &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot; (1999), a loose retelling of the tale of Beowulf starring Antonio Banderas, Diane Venora and Omar Sharif that was adapted from the novel &quot;Eaters of the Dead&quot; by Michael Crichton. The film did poorly at the box office, with a total loss estimated at $70–130 million. It received generally mixed-to-poor reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying that it &quot;lumber[s] from one expensive set-piece to the next without taking the time to tell a story that might make us care.&quot; Conversely, James Berardinelli gave it three stars out of four, calling it &quot;a solid offering&quot; that &quot;delivers an exhilarating 100 minutes&quot;. The outcome disappointed Sharif so much that he temporarily retired from film acting, saying &quot;After my small role in &quot;The 13th Warrior&quot;, I said to myself, &#x27;Let us stop this nonsense, these meal tickets that we do because it pays well. Sharif said it was &quot;terrifying to have to do the dialogue from bad scripts, to face a director who does not know what he is doing, in a film so bad that it is not even worth exploring.&quot; &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, directed by McTiernan a heist-film remake from the Norman Jewison original, starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo (instead of Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway – the latter performing a small part in the remake as Crown&#x27;s psychiatrist), which opened to solid reviews and strong box office results, was released later the same year.

McTiernan then directed the 2002 film &quot;Rollerball&quot;, a science fiction remake starring Chris Klein, Jean Reno, and LL Cool J. The second remake in a row of a Norman Jewison&#x27;s film to be directed by McTiernan, &quot;Rollerball&quot; was panned by critics. &quot;Time Out&quot;&#x27;s Trevor Johnson described it as &quot;a checklist shaped by a 15-year-old mallrat: thrashing metal track, skateboards, motorbikes, cracked heads and Rebecca Romijn with her top off&quot;, and Ebert called it &quot;an incoherent mess, a jumble of footage in search of plot, meaning, rhythm and sense&quot;. The film was a box-office flop, earning a worldwide total of $26m compared to a production budget of $70m. In 2014, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; listed the film as one of the most expensive box office flops of all time.

, his most recent feature film project was the 2003 thriller &quot;Basic&quot; with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson. The film was another box-office bomb for McTiernan, and reviews were mostly negative. Roger Ebert gave it one star out of four, saying it was &quot;not a film that could be understood&quot; and that &quot;If I were to see it again and again, I might be able to extract an underlying logic from it, but the problem is, when a movie&#x27;s not worth seeing twice, it had better get the job done the first time through.&quot; &quot;Leonard Maltin&#x27;s Movie Guide&quot; gave it two stars out of four and said the film &quot;keeps adding layers of confusion so that it becomes less interesting as it goes along! The final &#x27;twist&#x27; seems to negate the entire story, like a bad shaggy-dog joke.&quot;

After three consecutive critical and box-office failures, followed by the 2006 criminal charges which saw McTiernan spend time in prison, followed by civil lawsuits and bankruptcy, he was not hired again to direct a feature film. In 2016, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called McTiernan one of Hollywood&#x27;s most &quot;despised&quot; people. His short film, &quot;The Red Dot&quot;, was released by Ubisoft to advertise the 2017 video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon Wildlands&quot;. &quot;The Red Dot&quot; was his first film project in 14 years. In a 2024 interview, he stated that it had been his choice to not get involved with directing again, blaming the failures of his last feature films on scripts he couldn&#x27;t fix, and announced that he had since been focusing his time on uncredited script doctoring.

===Unproduced films===
==Legal issues==

===Criminal charges, felony conviction, and incarceration===
On April 3, 2006, McTiernan was charged in federal court with making a false statement to an FBI investigator in February 2006 about his hiring of the private investigator Anthony Pellicano to illegally wiretap Charles Roven, the producer of his film &quot;Rollerball&quot;, around August 2000. McTiernan had been in a disagreement with Roven about what type of film &quot;Rollerball&quot; should be, and had hired Pellicano to investigate Roven&#x27;s intentions and actions. He had asked Pellicano to try to find instances where Roven made negative remarks about the studio executives or said things to others that were inconsistent with what he said to the studio.

McTiernan was arraigned and pleaded guilty on April 17, 2006, as part of an initial plea bargain agreement to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for lenient treatment. Prosecutors said they then became convinced that he was continuing to lie to them, and that he had also hired Pellicano to wiretap someone else, prompting them to seek a prison sentence. McTiernan then hired new counsel and tried to withdraw his guilty plea, saying that his prior counsel had not conducted a proper discovery in the case and had not presented him with the available defense approach of suppressing as evidence the conversation with him that Pellicano had recorded on August 17, 2000. However, this bid was denied by the Federal District Judge, Dale S. Fischer, who immediately proceeded to sentence him to four months in prison and $100,000 in fines. The judge characterized McTiernan as someone who thought he was &quot;above the law&quot;, had shown no remorse, and &quot;lived a privileged life and simply wants to continue that&quot;. He was ordered to surrender for incarceration by January 15, 2008, but was allowed to remain out of prison on bail pending an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.

In October 2008, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated McTiernan&#x27;s four-month sentence and ruled that Judge Fischer had erred and he was entitled to a hearing as to whether his plea could be withdrawn. The prosecution (and the judge) then agreed to allow McTiernan to withdraw his plea rather than proceed with such a hearing, and his plea was withdrawn on February 24, 2009.

With the case reopened, the prosecution was no longer bound by the prior plea agreement, and filed additional charges against McTiernan; he faced another two counts of lying to the FBI (one for claiming he had hired Pellicano only in connection with his divorce proceedings and another for denying he had ever discussed wiretapping with Pellicano) and one count of committing perjury during the previous court proceedings by denying he had been coached by his attorney on what to say during his previous guilty plea hearing (a denial that he later stated in a declaration was false).

After some adverse rulings on his attempted defense arguments, and facing the possibility of a prison sentence of more than five years from the various charges, McTiernan eventually entered another guilty plea (on all three counts) in a second plea bargain in 2010, conditioned on his plan to appeal the earlier rulings against his defense approach, and Judge Fischer sentenced him to one year in prison, three years of supervised probation, and a fine of $100,000. The judge stated that the extended duration of the prison sentence was attributed to the additional, more severe charge of perjury before her court. She emphasized that McTiernan&#x27;s offenses transcended mere lapses in judgment, and he appeared to still not fully acknowledge responsibility for his actions. Additionally, she remarked that she would have imposed an even longer prison term if the prosecution hadn&#x27;t suggested otherwise. McTiernan was then released on bail pending an appeal of the adverse rulings.

On August 20, 2012, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court judgment, but allowed McTiernan to address the U.S. Supreme Court regarding his attempt to suppress the recorded conversation before being required to report to prison. His defense tried to argue that Pellicano had made the recording for an unlawful purpose and that this made it inadmissible, but the district and appeals courts disagreed with that interpretation of the rules of evidence. On January 14, 2013, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

McTiernan surrendered to federal prison on April 3, 2013, to serve a stated 12-month sentence in the Federal Prison Camp, Yankton, in Yankton, South Dakota, a minimum-security former college campus holding about 800 male inmates, most of whom were white-collar criminals. His Bureau of Prisons registration number was 43029-112. Although the Yankton facility was rated by &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as one of &quot;America&#x27;s 10 cushiest prisons&quot;, McTiernan&#x27;s wife Gail stated that he had found it hard to adapt, having lost ; she also claimed that he was suffering from depression, and was &quot;disintegrating&quot; emotionally. While in prison, McTiernan managed to write a possible sequel for &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;, with the working title &quot;Thomas Crown and the Missing Lioness&quot;. His supporters created a &quot;Free John McTiernan&quot; campaign page on Facebook, including expressions of support from Samuel L. Jackson, Alec Baldwin and Brad Bird. He was released from prison on February 25, 2014, after 328 days of incarceration, to serve the remainder of his 12-month prison sentence under house arrest at his ranch home in Wyoming until April 3, 2014.

===Invasion of privacy civil suit===
On July 3, 2006, McTiernan&#x27;s former wife, film producer Donna Dubrow, filed suit against him for invasion of privacy and other claims arising from her belief that he hired Pellicano to wiretap her telephone during their divorce negotiations. The lawsuit continued for a decade, ultimately being dismissed in 2016 at Dubrow&#x27;s request.

===Debts and bankruptcy===

In October 2013, while in prison, McTiernan filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy amidst foreclosure proceedings for his ranch residence in central Wyoming (valued at $8–10M), struggles to pay his past legal bills and IRS tax debts, and ongoing expensive disputes including the lawsuit by his ex-wife, a $5 million claim against him of liability in a 2011 automobile accident, and his ongoing effort to reverse his felony conviction.

The bank holding the mortgage on the ranch said the filing was a bad-faith tactic only intended to stall the foreclosure proceedings, and requested the presiding judge to convert the case to a chapter 7 bankruptcy under the terms of which he would lose control of the bankruptcy case and have a trustee appointed to manage his assets, which would result in the liquidation of his assets rather than giving McTiernan the opportunity to attempt to reorganize his debt himself.

McTiernan&#x27;s lawyers countered by saying that his potential for generating additional future income from new projects could enable him to eventually repay his debts, so a rapid liquidation of assets would be unnecessary and unjustified. In the bankruptcy proceedings, he identified two likely future film projects with Hannibal Pictures, with working titles &quot;Red Squad&quot; and &quot;Warbirds&quot;, with large budgets and significant likely future income and planned to star major well-known actors. On December 8, 2015, a judge ruled against McTiernan agreeing with his creditors that his assets should be liquidated. It was reported that his ranch was likely to be sold and that an administrator would take over the management of his future film royalty payments.

<text>Oranjestad (; ) is a small town of 1,038 inhabitants; it is the capital and largest town of the island of Sint Eustatius in the Caribbean Netherlands. It is not to be confused with the far larger Oranjestad in Aruba.

==Geography==
Oranjestad is a historic harbour town which is divided into two main sections. Lower Town is a strip of buildings just above sea level along the waterfront, which borders on the island&#x27;s safest beach. Lower Town includes dive shops, numerous colonial-era ruins, and the harbour. Upper Town has a restored historic core, and is also the island&#x27;s main commercial and residential centre. It is nestled between Quill &amp; Boven National Park 

Neighborhoods of Oranjestad:

• Golden Rock

• Bay Brow

==History==
===Historical sites===

The first colonist arrived between 1625 and 1629. Sint Eustatius produced sugar and cotton, but most importantly developed into a centre of the North American slave trade. In 1780, the island had an estimated population of 20,000 people including slaves. In 1781, during the Fourth Anglo-Dutch War, the island was captured and plundered by George Rodney. During the capture, all archives were destroyed. In 1786, it was home to 7,600 people (3,000 white, 600 coloureds and 4,000 slaves). In 1829, the population had decreased to 2,273.

The main historical site in Oranjestad is Fort Oranje, a well-maintained, 17th-century fort in the direct centre of the town, overlooking the waterfront. This cliff-side fort has cannons, intact bastions and a courtyard. Nearby is a museum, the ruins of one of the oldest synagogues in the Western Hemisphere, and a Jewish cemetery.

The town&#x27;s historical features also include a Dutch Reformed church built in 1755, which is partly in ruins but still accessible (its tower can be climbed for long-distance views), various restored 18th-century merchants&#x27; residences – including the oldest one, the &quot;Gezaghebber&quot; House (former Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s residence) on Kerkstraat – and restored wooden Caribbean-style houses. Snorkeling in Oranje Bay is also interesting because of the parts of 18th century buildings on the bay side that were swept into the sea.

== Facilities ==
Oranjestad itself contains grocery stores, restaurants, bars, a library, schools, a clinic and the administrative offices of the government.

<doc id="618162" wikidata="Q630281" url="?curid=618162" title="Messianism">
<text>Messianism is the belief in the advent of a messiah who acts as the savior of a group of people. Messianism originated as a Zoroastrian religious belief and followed to Abrahamic religions, but other religions also have messianism-related concepts. Religions with a messiah concept include Hinduism (Kalki), Judaism (Mashiach), Christianity (Christ), Islam (Mahdi and Isa Masih), Druze faith (Hamza ibn Ali), Zoroastrianism (Saoshyant), Buddhism (Maitreya), 
Taoism (Li Hong), and Bábism (He whom God shall make manifest).

In Judaism, the messiah will be a future Jewish king from the line of David and redeemer of the Jewish people and humanity. In Christianity, Jesus is the messiah, the savior, the redeemer, and God. In Islam, Jesus was a prophet and the messiah of the Jewish people who will return in the end times.

== Abrahamic religions ==
===Judaism===
Messiah (; &quot;mashiah&quot;, &quot;moshiah&quot;, &quot;mashiach&quot;, or &quot;moshiach&quot;, (&quot;anointed [one]&quot;) is a term used in the Hebrew Bible to describe priests and kings, who were traditionally anointed. For example, Cyrus the Great, the King of Persia, is referred to as &quot;God&#x27;s anointed&quot; (Messiah) in the Bible.

In Jewish messianic tradition and eschatology, the term came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be &quot;anointed&quot; with holy anointing oil and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. In Standard Hebrew, the messiah is often referred to as &quot;Melekh ha-Mashiaḥ&quot; (), literally &quot;the Anointed King&quot;.

Rabbinic Judaism and current Orthodox Judaism hold that the messiah will be an anointed one, descended from his father through the Davidic line of King David, who will gather the Jews back into the Land of Israel and usher in an era of peace.

Following the Expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492 many Spanish rabbis, such as Abraham ben Eliezer Halevi, believed that the year 1524 would be the beginning of the Messianic Age and that the Messiah himself would appear in 1530–31.

Orthodox Jewish messianic movements have occasionally emerged throughout the centuries among Jewish communities worldwide. These surround various messiah claimants. However, from the Jewish view, the claimants failed to deliver the promises of redemption, and generally remained with only a handful of followers. Excepting Jesus, the most popular messiah claimants were Simon bar Kokhba in 2nd century Judea, Nehemiah ben Hushiel in the 7th century Sasanian Empire, Sabbatai Zevi in the 17th century Ottoman Empire (precursor to Sabbateans), Jacob Frank in 18th century Europe, Shukr Kuhayl I and Judah ben Shalom in 19th century Ottoman Yemen. There are those who currently identify the 20th century Menachem Mendel Schneerson (the Lubavitcher Rebbe) as the Mashiach.

Other denominations, such as Reform Judaism, believe in a Messianic Age when the world will be at peace, but do not agree that there will be a messiah as the leader of this era.

===Christianity===
In Christianity, the Messiah is called the Christ (; ; ), the saviour and redeemer who would bring salvation to the Jewish people and mankind. &quot;Christ&quot; is the Greek translation of &quot;Messiah&quot;, meaning &quot;Anointed one&quot;. The role of the Christ, the Messiah in Christianity, originated from the concept of the messiah in Judaism. Though the conceptions of the messiah in each religion are similar, for the most part they are distinct from one another due to the split of early Christianity and Judaism in the 1st century. Christians believe Jesus to be the Jewish messiah (Christ) of the Hebrew Bible and the Christian Old Testament.

Christians believe that the messianic prophecies were fulfilled in his mission, death, resurrection, and ascension to his Session on the heavenly throne, where &quot;he sat down at the right hand of God, where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet&quot; (Heb 10:12–13 NET, quoting the Davidic royal Psalm 110:1). Christians believe that the rest of the messianic prophecies will be fulfilled in the Second Coming of Christ. One prophecy, distinctive in both the Jewish and Christian concept of the messiah, is that a Jewish king from the Davidic line, who will be &quot;anointed&quot; with holy anointing oil, will be king of God&#x27;s kingdom on earth, and rule the Jewish people and mankind during the Messianic Age and World to come.

===Islam===
In Islam (Shia and Sunni), the Mahdi is considered as the promised one [6] but there is a difference in who the Mahdi is, the Shiites of the Twelve Imams believe that the Mahdi is Muhammad, the son of Hassan Askari, the twelfth Imam and the Imam of their time, who was born before and now He is hidden from most people by Allah/god&#x27;s will for more than a thousand years and appears at the appointed time. But according to some people of the Sunnah, Mahdi is someone from the Prophet&#x27;s generation (probably Sadat&#x27;s dynasty) who has not yet been born. He will be born in the future and become the savior of mankind. Also, most of the followers of Sunnah consider Mahdi as an ordinary and very pure person, which is in contradiction with other prophecies of Abrahamic religions. Most of the Abrahamic religions have emphasized that the savior of the end of time is a divine messenger for humanity. According to Shiites, Mahdi is a divine chosen one, the proof of God and infallible. Also, they have mentioned many signs about the appearance of Mahdi. Shiites consider Mahdi an imam, and unlike Sunnis, according to their claim, relying on hadiths, traditions and verses of the Qur&#x27;an, especially the affliction of Abraham in Surah Baqarah, they consider Imamate to be a divine position and it is the highest position in the system of previous creation. They know Muhammad&#x27;s status as the highest of creations. Shiites emphasize the imams&#x27; formative authority and consider them to be the manifestation of God, and they have repeatedly mentioned in their works the superhuman powers given to imams by God. In fact, Shiites are not the first ones who have proposed the savior of the apocalypse as a manifestation of God. In Hindu religion, the savior of the end of time is called Avatar, which means manifestation, Avatar comes from the word Avatarai, which means the manifestation of a superior power. Some groups of Muslims, especially the Wahhabis, consider this claim of Shiites to be completely polytheistic and superstitious. While in the Torah, the book of Genesis, 12 kings from Ismael&#x27;s generation are mentioned, and Shiites consider these 12 kings to be their 12 imams. In the Sunni hadith books, 12 caliphs are mentioned after the Prophet of Islam, the last of whom is the promised Mahdi. All Muslims agree on the return of Jesus Christ, and some Sunnis and all Shiites of twelve Imams believe in the return of Christ at the time of the appearance of the Mahdi and consider him one of the special helpers of the promised Mahdi.

In Islam, Isa ibn Maryam is the &quot;al-Masih&quot; (&quot;Jesus son of Mary, the Messiah&quot;) who is believed to have been anointed from birth by Allah with the specific task of being a prophet and a king. In Islam, the Mahdi is believed to hold the task of establishing the truth and fighting against divisions of Islam, uniting all sects before the return of Jesus who will kill the false messiah &quot;Al-Masih ad-Dajjal&quot; (similar to the Antichrist in Christianity), who will emerge shortly before him in human form in the end of the times, claiming that he is the messiah. Then Jesus will pray for the death of Gog and Magog (Yajuj Majuj) who are an ancient tribe sealed away from humanity who will rise to cause destruction. After he has destroyed al-Dajjal, Mahdi&#x27;s final task will be to become a just king and to re-establish justice. After the death of Mahdi, Jesus&#x27; reign of the messianic King will begin bringing long-lasting peace in the world until the Day of Judgement.

: Narrated Abu Hurairah:
The Ahmadiyya Muslim community believes that the prophecies regarding the advent of the Messiah and Mahdi have been fulfilled in the person of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad of Qadian. He claimed to be the Promised Messiah and Mahdi, the metaphorical second coming of Jesus of Nazareth and the divine guide, whose advent was foretold by the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad.

===Druze faith===
In the Druze faith, Jesus is considered the Messiah and one of God&#x27;s important prophets, being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history. According to the Druze manuscripts Jesus is the Greatest Imam and the incarnation of Ultimate Reason (Akl) on earth and the first cosmic principle (Hadd), and regards Jesus and Hamza ibn Ali as the incarnations of one of the five great celestial powers, who form part of their system. Druze doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary, performed miracles, and died by crucifixion.

In the Druze tradition, Jesus is known under three titles: the True Messiah (&quot;al-Masih al-Haq&quot;), the Messiah of all Nations (&quot;Masih al-Umam&quot;), and the Messiah of Sinners. This is due, respectively, to the belief that Jesus delivered the true Gospel message, the belief that he was the Saviour of all nations, and the belief that he offers forgiveness. 

Druze believe that Hamza ibn Ali was a reincarnation of Jesus, and that Hamza ibn Ali is the true Messiah, who directed the deeds of the messiah Jesus &quot;the son of Joseph and Mary&quot;, but when messiah Jesus &quot;the son of Joseph and Mary&quot; strayed from the path of the true Messiah, Hamza filled the hearts of the Jews with hatred for him – and for that reason, they crucified him, according to the Druze manuscripts. Despite this, Hamza ibn Ali took him down from the cross and allowed him to return to his family, in order to prepare men for the preaching of his religion.

===Bábism and Baháʼí Faith===

He whom God shall make manifest (, ) is a messianic figure in the religion of Bábism. The messianic figure was repeatedly mentioned by the Báb, the founder of Bábism, in His book, the Bayán. The Báb described the messianic figure as the origin of all divine attributes, and stated that his command was equivalent to God’s command. The Báb stated that once the messianic figure had arrived, the perusal of one of his verses was to be greater than a thousand perusals of the Bayán. The prediction is widely recognized as being fulfilled by Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith.

==Other religions==

===Buddhism===

Maitreya is a bodhisattva who in the Buddhist tradition is to appear on Earth, achieve complete enlightenment, and teach the pure dharma. According to scriptures, Maitreya will be a successor of the historic Śākyamuni Buddha, the founder of Buddhism. The prophecy of the arrival of Maitreya is found in the canonical literature of all Buddhist sects (Theravāda, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna) and is accepted by most Buddhists as a statement about an actual event that will take place in the distant future.

Although Maitreya Buddha appears in the canonical literature shared by many sects of Buddhism, Buddhists in different historical contexts have conceived of Maitreya Buddha in different ways. In early medieval Chinese Buddhism, for example, Taoist and Buddhist ideas combined to produce a particular emphasis on the messianic role of a Bodhisattva called &quot;Prince Moonlight.&quot; Furthermore, the Chinese Maitreyan traditions were themselves marked by considerable diversity. Erik Zürcher has argued that a certain &quot;canonical&quot; Maitreyan cult from the fourth to sixth centuries believed Maitreya to inhabit the Tushita heaven where Buddhists might be reborn in the very distant future. Another rival tradition, however, believed that Maitreya would appear in the imminent future in this world to provide salvation during a time of misery and decline. This latter form of Maitreyan belief was generally censored and condemned as heretical to the point that few manuscripts survive written by Buddhists sympathetic to this tradition.

Maitreya Buddha continued to be an important figure in millenarian rebellions throughout Chinese history such as in the rebellions associated with the so-called White Lotus Society.

===Cargo cults===

John Frum is a figure associated with cargo cults on the island of Tanna in Vanuatu. He is often depicted as an American World War II serviceman who will bring wealth and prosperity to the people if they follow him. He is sometimes portrayed as black, sometimes as white. Quoting David Attenborough&#x27;s report of an encounter: &quot;&#x27;E look like you. &#x27;E got white face. &#x27;E tall man. &#x27;E live &#x27;long South America.&quot;

===Nazi messianism===

There has been significant literature on the potential religious aspects of Nazism. Wilfried Daim suggests that Hitler and the Nazi leadership planned to replace Christianity in Germany with a new religion in which Hitler would be considered a messiah. In his book on the connection between Lanz von Liebenfels and Hitler, Daim published a reprint of an alleged document of a session on &quot;the unconditional abolishment of all religious commitments (&quot;Religionsbekenntnisse&quot;) after the final victory (&quot;Endsieg&quot;) ... with a simultaneous proclamation of Adolf Hitler as the new messiah.&quot;

Within the Wotansvolk Neo-Völkisch mystery religion, David Eden Lane is regarded as the &quot;666 Man&quot; and the &quot;Man David&quot; of prophecy, an anti-Christian &quot;Messiah&quot; incarnated to &quot;warn and save the White Aryan race from near extinction&quot;.

===Russian and Slavic messianism===

Romantic Slavic messianism held that the Slavs, especially the Russians, suffer in order that other European nations, and eventually all of humanity, may be redeemed. This theme had a profound impact in the development of Pan-Slavism and Russian and Soviet imperialism; it also appears in works by the Polish Romantic poets Zygmunt Krasiński and Adam Mickiewicz, including the latter&#x27;s familiar expression, &quot;Polska Chrystusem narodów&quot; (&quot;Poland is the Christ of nations&quot;). Messianic ideas appear in the &quot;Books of the Genesis of the Ukrainian People&quot; (Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius Manifesto), in which universal equality and democracy in the Zaporizhian Sich, recognized as a revival of human society initially planned by God and faith in its future revival, associated with faith in the death and resurrection of Christ. Reborn Ukraine will expand universal freedom and faith in all Slavic countries and, thus designed by God, an ideal society will be restored.

===Sebastianism===

Sebastianism () is a Portuguese messianic myth, based on the belief that King Sebastian of Portugal, disappeared in the battle of Alcácer Quibir, will return to Portugal and create the Fifth Empire. The belief gained momentum after an interpretation by priest António Vieira of Daniel 2 and the Book of Revelation. In Brazil the most important manifestation of Sebastianism took place in the context of the Proclamation of the Republic, when movements emerged that defended a return to the monarchy. It is categorised as an example of the King asleep in mountain folk motif, typified by people waiting for a hero. The Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa wrote about such a hero in his epic &quot;Mensagem&quot; (&quot;The Message&quot;).

It is one of the longest-lived and most influential millenarian legends in Western Europe, having had profound political and cultural resonances from the time of Sebastians death till at least the late 19th century in Brazil.

===Taoism===
Around the 3rd century CE, religious Taoism developed eschatological ideas. A number of scriptures predict the end of the world cycle, the deluge, epidemics, and coming of the saviour Li Hong 李弘 (not to be confused with the Tang personalities).

===Wicca, Stregheria, Neopaganism and Witchcraft===

Aradia is one of the principal figures in the American folklorist Charles Godfrey Leland&#x27;s 1899 work &quot;Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches&quot;, which he believed to be a genuine religious text used by a group of pagan witches in Tuscany, a claim that has subsequently been disputed by other folklorists and historians. In Leland&#x27;s &quot;Gospel&quot;, Aradia is portrayed as a Messiah who was sent to Earth in order to teach the oppressed peasants how to perform witchcraft to use against the Roman Catholic Church and the upper classes.

Since the publication of Leland&#x27;s &quot;Gospel&quot;, Aradia has become &quot;arguably one of the central figures of the modern pagan witchcraft revival&quot; and as such has featured in various forms of Neopaganism, including Wicca and Stregheria, as an actual deity. 
Raven Grimassi, founder of the Wiccan-inspired tradition of Stregheria, claims that Aradia was a historical figure named &quot;Aradia di Toscano&quot;, who led a group of &quot;Diana-worshipping witches&quot; in 14th-century Tuscany.

===Zoroastrianism===

According to Zoroastrian philosophy, redacted in the Zand-i Vohuman Yasht,
Saoshyant, the Man of Peace, battles the forces of evil. The events of the final renovation are described in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot; (30.1ff): &quot;In the final battle with evil, the &quot;yazata&quot;s Airyaman and Atar will &#x27;melt the metal in the hills and mountains, and it will be upon the earth like a river&#x27; (Bundahishn 34.18), but the righteous (&quot;ashavan&quot;) will not be harmed.&quot;

Eventually, Ahura Mazda will triumph, and his agent Saoshyant will resurrect the dead, whose bodies will be restored to eternal perfection, and whose souls will be cleansed and reunited with God. Time will then end, and truth/righteousness (&quot;asha&quot;) and immortality will thereafter be everlasting.

<text>Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus (or Togidubnus, Togidumnus or similar; see naming difficulties) was a 1st-century king of the Regni or Regnenses tribe in early Roman Britain.

Chichester and the nearby Roman villa at Fishbourne, believed by some to have been Cogidubnus&#x27; palace, were probably part of the territory of the Atrebates tribe before the Roman conquest of Britain in AD 43. Cogidubnus may therefore have been an heir of Verica, the Atrebatic king whose overthrow prompted the emperor Claudius to invade. After the conquest, the area formed part of the civitas of the Regnenses / Regni, possibly Cogidubnus&#x27; kingdom before being incorporated into the Roman province. The public baths, amphitheatre and forum in Silchester were probably built in Cogidubnus&#x27; time.

==Sources==
In Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Agricola&quot;, published 98, where his name appears as &quot;Cogidumnus&quot; in most manuscripts although they can be considered as copies, and &quot;Togidumnus&quot; in one, he is said to have governed several &quot;civitates&quot; (states or tribal territories) as a client ruler after the Roman conquest, and to have been loyal &quot;down to our own times&quot; (at least into the 70s).

He is also known from an inscription on a damaged slab of marble found in Chichester in 1723 and datable to the late 1st century. As reconstructed by J.E. Bogaers, it reads (reconstructed parts in square brackets):

Which is translated as:

Another fragmentary inscription, reading , was found at the Gallo-Roman town of Mediolanum Santonum (modern Saintes, south-west France), although it is unlikely this refers to the same person.

==Naming difficulties==
In the Chichester inscription, the first two letters of the king&#x27;s native name, given in the genitive case, are missing. It is usually reconstructed as &quot;Cogidubnus&quot;, following the majority of manuscripts of Tacitus, but some, including Charles E Murgia, believe &quot;Togidubnus&quot; is the more linguistically correct form as a Celtic name. The Roman names &quot;Tiberius Claudius&quot; indicate that he was given Roman citizenship by the emperor Claudius, or possibly by Nero, and probably not, as has been suggested, that he was related to Claudia Rufina, a woman of British descent whose marriage to Aulus Pudens in Rome in the 90s is mentioned by the poet Martial.

He is nearly contemporary with Togodumnus, a prince of the Catuvellauni tribe mentioned by Dio Cassius, and the similarity of their names has led some, including Dr Miles Russell of Bournemouth University and the distinguished archaeologist Professor Barry Cunliffe of Oxford University, to suggest that they may be one and the same, thereby making the Fishbourne king a son of Cunobelinus and brother of Caratacus. However the sources do not appear to support this: according to Dio, Togodumnus was killed in 43 in the early stages of the Roman conquest of Britain, whilst Tacitus says that Cogidubnus remained loyal to Rome as a client king into the later part of the 1st century. It is of course not unusual for two people to have similar names (cf. Dubnovellaunus). As the Chichester inscription supports Tacitus, Cunliffe&#x27;s interpretation would appear to imply an error in Dio&#x27;s &quot;Roman History&quot; or in its transmission, and some, including John Hind, have argued that Dio misinterpreted his sources as reading that Togodumnus had died when he had merely been defeated.

==Villa at Fishbourne==
Barry Cunliffe (the archaeologist who uncovered Fishbourne) has put forward the theory that Fishbourne Roman Palace was Cogidubnus&#x27;s royal seat. Certainly the early phase of the palace, which dates to around AD 65, could have belonged to him or to one Tiberius Claudius Catuarus, whose inscribed gold ring was found in excavations close by. Miles Russell, however, has suggested that, as the main constructional phase of the palace proper at Fishbourne seems to have been in the early AD 90s, during the reign of the emperor Domitian who built the Domus Flavia, a palace of similar design upon the Palatine Hill in Rome, Fishbourne may instead have been built for Sallustius Lucullus, a Roman governor of Britain of the late 1st century. Lucullus may have been the son of the British prince Adminius.

==In fiction==
Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus appears in the Cambridge Latin Course Books II and III and lives in the Palace of Fishbourne mentioned above. He falls ill during the book and moves to Bath, since he believes the sacred baths can cure him of his illness, but he meets Salvius. In the books, he is in the middle of a conspiracy against his life, headed by the wicked Salvius and the Emperor Domitian. He dies under house arrest in the spring of 83, after being ill for some time, and his will is recreated by Salvius in order to give himself the Palace of Fishbourne.

He is also the central character in Mark Patton&#x27;s novel, &quot;An Accidental King&quot;, and a minor character in Douglas Jackson&#x27;s novel, &quot;Claudius&quot;.

He is the father of the central characters of &quot;They of Rome&quot;

He is a minor character in Lindsey Davis&#x27;s novels, &quot;A Body in the Bath House&quot;. and &quot;The Jupiter Myth&quot;.

He is the first-person protagonist in Linda Proud&#x27;s novel &quot;Chariot of the Soul&quot;, in which he describes his education in Rome, studying Stoicism with Seneca, and his return to Britain charged with the mission of persuading the tribal kings not to resist the invasion of the Romans.

He is mentioned in Ben Aaronovitch&#x27;s novel Broken Homes, where he is one of the &quot;Rivers of London”, and in Simon Scarrow’s novel ‘Under the Eagle’.

<text>Epaphroditus Ransom (March 24, 1798 – November 11, 1859) was an American politician who served as the seventh governor of Michigan and as a justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.

==Early life==
Ransom was born in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts. There is disagreement about the year of his birth, sometimes given as 1787, 1796, or 1798. Sources have also shown two different dates of death, November 9 and 11. His tombstone shows he died at the age of 61 on November 11, 1859, which agrees with the 1798 year of birth.

He was the fourth of twelve children and was educated at various schools in New England, such as Chester Academy of Vermont for four years. He studied at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts receiving his degree in 1823, and then began his own practice in Townshend, Vermont. He married Almira Cadwell on February 21, 1827, in Montpelier, Vermont, and they had four children, yet two would die during infancy. He was elected to the Vermont House of Representatives, but after seeing his siblings move to Michigan Territory as well as receiving advice from former Vermonter and Michigan Territorial delegate, Lucius Lyon, decided instead to move his family there in 1834.

==Life and politics in Michigan==
After over a month of traveling by wagon and steamboat, the Ransoms arrived in Michigan Territory on November 14, 1834, in the small town of Bronson, which is now Kalamazoo, Michigan. There he gained admittance to the bar and began practicing law. He took up farming and other business ventures and soon became active in politics. He served in the state legislature and became that area&#x27;s first circuit court judge, riding horseback through the wilderness to hear cases.

Ransom was appointed by Governor Stevens T. Mason as an associate justice of the state Supreme Court in 1837 and served as chief justice from 1843 to 1848. In one notable issue, he issued a declaration in 1840 that prevented the removal of the Catholic Potawatomi from their lands in southwestern Michigan.

==Governor of Michigan and later life ==
In 1848, Ransom resigned from the court after being elected governor, and was the first governor to be inaugurated in Lansing, Michigan, after the state capitol moved there from Detroit. During his term as governor, the first telegraph line from New York City to Detroit was completed and the first message sent on March 1.

There were two notable immigrations to the state during his administration. A group of Dutch immigrants came to western Michigan, led by Rev. Van Raalte, of the Dutch Reformed Church. They founded the city of Holland, Michigan and later established Hope College. James Jesse Strang led the other immigration, consisting of a faction of Mormon followers. They settled on Beaver Island in northern Lake Michigan. Strang founded a kingdom there with a capital, St. James named for himself. Strang was even elected to the state legislature twice, but anti-Mormon sentiment and his totalitarian rule of the island led to his assassination.

Because of Ransom&#x27;s strong anti-slavery position, the state Democratic Party did not re-nominate him for governor in 1850. He was elected again to the state legislature in 1853 and 1854.

He was also the first president of the Michigan Agricultural Society, which was instrumental in the creation of both the Michigan State Fair and Michigan State University. He served as regent of the University of Michigan from 1850 to 1852 and was a co-founder of the village of Augusta, Michigan.

His private business ventures were ruined by the Panic of 1855, and in 1857, Ransom accepted appointment from U.S. President James Buchanan as receiver of the public monies for the Osage Land Office in Fort Scott, Kansas.

==Death ==
He died at the age of 61 in Fort Scott and is interred at Mountain Home Cemetery in Kalamazoo.

<doc id="618169" wikidata="Q1635352" url="?curid=618169" title="DC-to-DC converter">
<text>A DC-to-DC converter is an electronic circuit or electromechanical device that converts a source of direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another. It is a type of electric power converter. Power levels range from very low (small batteries) to very high (high-voltage power transmission).

==History==

Before the development of power semiconductors, one way to convert the voltage of a DC supply to a higher voltage, for low-power applications, was to convert it to AC by using a vibrator, then by a step-up transformer, and finally a rectifier. Where higher power was needed, a motor–generator unit was often used, in which an electric motor drove a generator that produced the desired voltage. (The motor and generator could be separate devices, or they could be combined into a single &quot;dynamotor&quot; unit with no external power shaft.) These relatively inefficient and expensive designs were used only when there was no alternative, as to power a car radio (which then used thermionic valves (tubes) that require much higher voltages than available from a 6 or 12 V car battery).

The introduction of power semiconductors and integrated circuits made it economically viable by use of techniques described below. For example, first is converting the DC power supply to high-frequency AC as an input of a transformer - it is small, light, and cheap due to the high frequency — that changes the voltage which gets rectified back to DC. Although by 1976 transistor car radio receivers did not require high voltages, some amateur radio operators continued to use vibrator supplies and dynamotors for mobile transceivers requiring high voltages although transistorized power supplies were available.

While it was possible to derive a &quot;lower&quot; voltage from a higher with a linear regulator or even a resistor, these methods dissipated the excess as heat; energy-efficient conversion became possible only with solid-state switch-mode circuits.

== Uses ==

DC-to-DC converters are used in portable electronic devices such as cellular phones and laptop computers, which are supplied with power from batteries primarily. Such electronic devices often contain several sub-circuits, each with its own voltage level requirement different from that supplied by the battery or an external supply (sometimes higher or lower than the supply voltage). Additionally, the battery voltage declines as its stored energy is drained. Switched DC to DC converters offer a method to increase voltage from a partially lowered battery voltage thereby saving space instead of using multiple batteries to accomplish the same thing.

Most DC-to-DC converter circuits also regulate the output voltage. Some exceptions include high-efficiency LED power sources, which are a kind of DC to DC converter that regulates the current through the LEDs, and simple charge pumps which double or triple the output voltage.

DC-to-DC converters which are designed to maximize the energy harvest for photovoltaic systems and for wind turbines are called power optimizers.

Transformers used for voltage conversion at mains frequencies of 50–60 Hz must be large and heavy for powers exceeding a few watts. This makes them expensive, and they are subject to energy losses in their windings and due to eddy currents in their cores. DC-to-DC techniques that use transformers or inductors work at much higher frequencies, requiring only much smaller, lighter, and cheaper wound components. Consequently these techniques are used even where a mains transformer could be used; for example, for domestic electronic appliances it is preferable to rectify mains voltage to DC, use switch-mode techniques to convert it to high-frequency AC at the desired voltage, then, usually, rectify to DC. The entire complex circuit is cheaper and more efficient than a simple mains transformer circuit of the same output. DC-to-DC converters are widely used for DC microgrid applications, in the context of different voltage levels.

== Electronic conversion ==


Switching converters or switched-mode DC-to-DC converters store the input energy temporarily and then release that energy to the output at a different voltage, which may be higher or lower. The storage may be in either magnetic field storage components (inductors, transformers) or electric field storage components (capacitors). This conversion method can increase or decrease voltage. Switching conversion is often more power-efficient (typical efficiency is 75% to 98%) than linear voltage regulation, which dissipates unwanted power as heat. Fast semiconductor device rise and fall times are required for efficiency; however, these fast transitions combine with layout parasitic effects to make circuit design challenging. The higher efficiency of a switched-mode converter reduces the heatsinking needed, and increases battery endurance of portable equipment. Efficiency has improved since the late 1980s due to the use of power FETs, which are able to switch more efficiently with lower at higher frequencies than power bipolar transistors, and use less complex drive circuitry.
Another important improvement in DC-DC converters is replacing the flyback diode with synchronous rectification using a power FET, whose &quot;on resistance&quot; is much lower, reducing conduction losses. Before the wide availability of power semiconductors, low-power DC-to-DC synchronous converters consisted of an electro-mechanical vibrator followed by a voltage step-up transformer feeding a vacuum tube or semiconductor rectifier, or synchronous rectifier contacts on the vibrator.

Most DC-to-DC converters are designed to move power in only one direction, from dedicated input to output. However, all switching regulator topologies can be made bidirectional and able to move power in either direction by replacing all diodes with independently controlled active rectification. A bidirectional converter is useful, for example, in applications requiring regenerative braking of vehicles, where power is supplied &quot;to&quot; the wheels while driving, but supplied &quot;by&quot; the wheels when braking.

Although they require few components, switching converters are electronically complex. Like all high-frequency circuits, their components must be carefully specified and physically arranged to achieve stable operation and to keep switching noise (EMI / RFI) at acceptable levels. Their cost is higher than linear regulators in voltage-dropping applications, but their cost has been decreasing with advances in chip design.

DC-to-DC converters are available as integrated circuits (ICs) requiring few additional components. Converters are also available as complete hybrid circuit modules, ready for use within an electronic assembly.

Linear regulators which are used to output a stable DC independent of input voltage and output load from a higher but less stable input by dissipating excess volt-amperes as heat, could be described literally as DC-to-DC converters, but this is not usual usage. (The same could be said of a simple voltage dropper resistor, whether or not stabilised by a following voltage regulator or Zener diode.)

There are also simple capacitive voltage doubler and Dickson multiplier circuits using diodes and capacitors to multiply a DC voltage by an integer value, typically delivering only a small current.

=== Magnetic===

In these DC-to-DC converters, energy is periodically stored within and released from a magnetic field in an inductor or a transformer, typically within a frequency range of 300 kHz to 10 MHz. By adjusting the duty cycle of the charging voltage (that is, the ratio of the on/off times), the amount of power transferred to a load can be more easily controlled, though this control can also be applied to the input current, the output current, or to maintain constant power. Transformer-based converters may provide isolation between input and output. In general, the term &quot;DC-to-DC converter&quot; refers to one of these switching converters. These circuits are the heart of a switched-mode power supply. Many topologies exist. This table shows the most common ones.

In addition, each topology may be:
; Hard switched: Transistors switch quickly while exposed to both full voltage and full current
; Resonant: An LC circuit shapes the voltage across the transistor and current through it so that the transistor switches when either the voltage or the current is zero

Magnetic DC-to-DC converters may be operated in two modes, according to the current in its main magnetic component (inductor or transformer):
; Continuous: The current fluctuates but never goes down to zero
; Discontinuous: The current fluctuates during the cycle, going down to zero at or before the end of each cycle
A converter may be designed to operate in continuous mode at high power, and in discontinuous mode at low power.

The half bridge and flyback topologies are similar in that energy stored in the magnetic core needs to be dissipated so that the core does not saturate. Power transmission in a flyback circuit is limited by the amount of energy that can be stored in the core, while forward circuits are usually limited by the I/V characteristics of the switches.

Although MOSFET switches can tolerate simultaneous full current and voltage (although thermal stress and electromigration can shorten the MTBF), bipolar switches generally can&#x27;t so require the use of a snubber (or two).

High-current systems often use multiphase converters, also called interleaved converters.
Multiphase regulators can have better ripple and better response times than single-phase regulators.

Many laptop and desktop motherboards include interleaved buck regulators, sometimes as a voltage regulator module.

=== Bidirectional DC-to-DC converters ===
Specific to these converters is that the energy flows in both directions of the converter. These converters are commonly used in various applications and they are connected between two levels of DC voltage, where energy is transferred from one level to another.

* Boost bidirectional DC-to-DC converter 
* Buck bidirectional DC-to-DC converter 
* Boost-buck non-inverting bidirectional DC-to-DC converter
* Boost-buck inverting bidirectional DC-to-DC converter
* SEPIC bidirectional DC-to-DC converter
* CUK bidirectional DC-to-DC converter

Multiple isolated bidirectional DC-to-DC converters are also commonly used in cases where galvanic isolation is needed.

* Bidirectional flyback 
* Isolated ĆUK &amp; SEPIC/ZETA
* Push-pull
* Forward
* Dual-active bridge (DAB)
* Dual-half bridge
* Half-full bridge
* Multiport DAB

=== Capacitive ===
Switched capacitor converters rely on alternately connecting capacitors to the input and output in differing topologies. For example, a switched-capacitor reducing converter might charge two capacitors in series and then discharge them in parallel. This would produce the same output power (less that lost to efficiency of under 100%) at, ideally, half the input voltage and twice the current. Because they operate on discrete quantities of charge, these are also sometimes referred to as charge pump converters. They are typically used in applications requiring relatively small currents, as at higher currents the increased efficiency and smaller size of switch-mode converters makes them a better choice. They are also used at extremely high voltages, as magnetics would break down at such voltages.

==Electromechanical conversion==
A motor–generator set, mainly of historical interest, consists of an electric motor and generator coupled together. A &quot;dynamotor&quot; combines both functions into a single unit with coils for both the motor and the generator functions wound around a single rotor; both coils share the same outer field coils or magnets. Typically the motor coils are driven from a commutator on one end of the shaft, when the generator coils output to another commutator on the other end of the shaft. The entire rotor and shaft assembly is smaller in size than a pair of machines, and may not have any exposed drive shafts.

Motor–generators can convert between any combination of DC and AC voltage and phase standards. Large motor–generator sets were widely used to convert industrial amounts of power while smaller units were used to convert battery power (6, 12 or 24 V DC) to a high DC voltage, which was required to operate vacuum tube (thermionic valve) equipment.

For lower-power requirements at voltages higher than supplied by a vehicle battery, vibrator or &quot;buzzer&quot; power supplies were used. The vibrator oscillated mechanically, with contacts that switched the polarity of the battery many times per second, effectively converting DC to square wave AC, which could then be fed to a transformer of the required output voltage(s). It made a characteristic buzzing noise.

== Electrochemical conversion==
A further means of DC to DC conversion in the kilowatts to megawatts range is presented by using redox flow batteries such as the vanadium redox battery.

== Chaotic behavior ==
DC-to-DC converters are subject to different types of chaotic dynamics such as bifurcation, crisis, and intermittency.

== Terminology ==
; Step-down
: A converter where the output voltage is lower than the input voltage (such as a buck converter).
; Step-up
:A converter that outputs a voltage higher than the input voltage (such as a boost converter).
; Continuous current mode
:Current and thus the magnetic field in the inductive energy storage never reaches zero.
;Discontinuous current mode
:Current and thus the magnetic field in the inductive energy storage may reach or cross zero.
;Noise
:Unwanted electrical and electromagnetic signal noise, typically switching artifacts.
;RF noise
:Switching converters inherently emit radio waves at the switching frequency and its harmonics. Switching converters that produce triangular switching current, such as the split-pi, forward converter, or Ćuk converter in continuous current mode, produce less harmonic noise than other switching converters. RF noise causes electromagnetic interference (EMI). Acceptable levels depend upon requirements, e.g. proximity to RF circuitry needs more suppression than simply meeting regulations.
;Coil-integrated DC/DC converters
:These may include a power control IC, coil, capacitor, and resistor; decreases mounting space with a small number of components in a single integrated solution.
;Input noise
:The input voltage may have non-negligible noise. Additionally, if the converter loads the input with sharp load edges, the converter can emit RF noise from the supplying power lines. This should be prevented with proper filtering in the input stage of the converter.
;Output noise
:The output of an ideal DC-to-DC converter is a flat, constant output voltage. However, real converters produce a DC output upon which is superimposed some level of electrical noise. Switching converters produce switching noise at the switching frequency and its harmonics. Additionally, all electronic circuits have some thermal noise. Some sensitive radio-frequency and analog circuits require a power supply with so little noise that it can only be provided by a linear regulator. Some analog circuits which require a power supply with relatively low noise can tolerate some of the less-noisy switching converters, e.g. using continuous triangular waveforms rather than square waves.

<doc id="618171" wikidata="Q640435" url="?curid=618171" title="Resource Reservation Protocol">
<text>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol designed to reserve resources across a network using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is described in .

RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific levels of quality of service (QoS) for application data streams. RSVP defines how applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved resources once no longer required. RSVP operations will generally result in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a routing protocol but was designed to interoperate with current and future routing protocols.

In 2003, development effort was shifted from RSVP to RSVP-TE for teletraffic engineering. Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) was a proposed replacement for RSVP.

==Main attributes==

#RSVP requests resources for simplex flows: a traffic stream in only one direction from sender to one or more receivers.
#RSVP is not a routing protocol but works with current and future routing protocols.
#RSVP is receiver oriented in that the receiver of a data flow initiates and maintains the resource reservation for that flow.
#RSVP maintains soft state (the reservation at each node needs a periodic refresh) of the host and routers&#x27; resource reservations, hence supporting dynamic automatic adaptation to network changes.
#RSVP provides several reservation styles (a set of reservation options) and allows for future styles to be added in protocol revisions to fit varied applications.
#RSVP transports and maintains traffic and policy control parameters that are opaque to RSVP.

==History and related standards==
The basic concepts of RSVP were originally proposed in 1993.

RSVP is described in a series of RFC documents from the IETF:

* : The version 1 functional specification was described in RFC 2205 (Sept. 1997) by IETF. Version 1 describes the interface to admission (traffic) control that is based &quot;only&quot; on resource availability. Later RFC2750 extended the admission control support.
* defines the use of RSVP with controlled-load RFC 2211 and guaranteed RFC 2212 QoS control services. More details in Integrated Services. Also defines the usage and data format of the data objects (that carry resource reservation information) defined by RSVP in RFC 2205.
* specifies the network element behavior required to deliver Controlled-Load services.
* specifies the network element behavior required to deliver guaranteed QoS services.
* describes a proposed extension for supporting generic policy based admission control in RSVP. The extension included a specification of policy objects and a description on handling policy events. (January 2000).
* , &quot;RSVP-TE: Extensions to RSVP for LSP Tunnels&quot; (December 2001).
* , &quot;Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) Signaling Resource ReserVation Protocol-Traffic Engineering (RSVP-TE) Extensions&quot; (January 2003).
* , &quot;Procedures for Modifying the Resource reSerVation Protocol (RSVP)&quot; (October 2004), describes current best practices and specifies procedures for modifying RSVP.
* , &quot;A Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Extension for the Reduction of Bandwidth of a Reservation Flow&quot; (May 2006), extends RSVP to enable the bandwidth of an existing reservation to be reduced instead of tearing down the reservation.
* , &quot;Node-ID Based Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) Hello: A Clarification Statement&quot; (June 2006).

==Key concepts==
The two key concepts of RSVP reservation model are &quot;flowspec&quot; and &quot;filterspec&quot;.

===Flowspec===
RSVP reserves resources for a flow. A flow is identified by the destination address, the protocol identifier, and, optionally, the destination port. In Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) a flow is defined as a label-switched path (LSP). For each flow, RSVP also identifies the particular quality of service (QoS) required by the flow. This QoS information is called a &quot;flowspec&quot; and RSVP passes the &quot;flowspec&quot; from the application to the hosts and routers along the path. Those systems then analyse the &quot;flowspec&quot; to accept and reserve the resources.
A &quot;flowspec&quot; consists of:
#Service class
#Reservation spec - defines the QoS
#Traffic spec - describes the data flow

===Filterspec===
The &quot;filterspec&quot; defines the set of packets that shall be affected by a &quot;flowspec&quot; (i.e. the data packets to receive the QoS defined by the flowspec). A &quot;filterspec&quot; typically selects a subset of all the packets processed by a node. The selection can depend on any attribute of a packet (e.g. the sender IP address and port).

The currently defined RSVP reservation styles are:
#Fixed filter - reserves resources for a specific flow.
#Shared explicit - reserves resources for several flows and all share the resources
#Wildcard filter - reserves resources for a general type of flow without specifying the flow; all flows share the resources

An RSVP reservation request consists of a &quot;flowspec&quot; and a &quot;filterspec&quot; and the pair is called a &quot;flowdescriptor&quot;. The &quot;flowspec&quot; sets the parameters of the packet scheduler at a node and the &quot;filterspec&quot; sets the parameters at the packet classifier.

==Messages==
There are two primary types of messages:
*Path messages (&quot;path&quot;)
:The &quot;path&quot; message is sent from the sender host along the data path and stores the &quot;path state&quot; in each node along the path.
:The &quot;path state&quot; includes the IP address of the previous node, and some data objects:
::#&quot;sender template&quot; to describe the format of the sender data in the form of a Filterspec
::#&quot;sender tspec&quot; to describe the traffic characteristics of the data flow
::#&quot;adspec&quot; that carries advertising data (see RFC 2210 for more details).
*Reservation messages (&quot;resv&quot;)
:The &quot;resv&quot; message is sent from the receiver to the sender host along the reverse data path. At each node the IP destination address of the &quot;resv&quot; message will change to the address of the next node on the reverse path and the IP source address to the address of the previous node address on the reverse path.
:The &quot;resv&quot; message includes the &quot;flowspec&quot; data object that identifies the resources that the flow needs.

The data objects on RSVP messages can be transmitted in any order. For the complete list of RSVP messages and data objects see RFC 2205.

==Operation==
An RSVP host that needs to send a data flow with specific QoS will transmit an RSVP &quot;path&quot; message every 30 seconds that will travel along the unicast or multicast routes pre-established by the working routing protocol. If the &quot;path&quot; message arrives at a router that does not understand RSVP, that router forwards the message without interpreting the contents of the message and will not reserve resources for the flow.

Those who want to listen to them send a corresponding &quot;resv&quot; (short for &quot;reserve&quot;) message which then traces the path back to the sender. The &quot;resv&quot; message contains a &quot;flowspec&quot;. The &quot;resv&quot; message also has a &quot;filterspec&quot; object; it defines the packets that will receive the requested QoS defined in the flowspec. A simple filter spec could be just the sender’s IP address and optionally its UDP or TCP port. When a router receives the RSVP &quot;resv&quot; message it will:
#Make a reservation based on the request parameters. Admission control processes the request parameters and can either instruct the packet classifier to correctly handle the selected subset of data packets or negotiate with the upper layer how the packet handling should be performed. If the cannot be supported, a reject message is sent to let the listener know.
#Forward the request upstream (in the direction of the sender). At each node the &quot;flowspec&quot; in the &quot;resv&quot; message can be modified by a forwarding node (e.g. in the case of a multicast flow reservation the reservations requests can be merged).
#The routers then store the nature of the flow and optionally set up policing according to the flowspec for it. 

If nothing is heard for a certain length of time the reservation will time out and will be canceled. This solves the problem if either the sender or the receiver crash or are shut down without first canceling the reservation.

==Other features==
;Integrity
:RSVP messages are appended with a message digest created by combining the message contents and a shared key using a message digest algorithm (commonly MD5). The key can be distributed and confirmed using two message types: &quot;integrity challenge request&quot; and &quot;integrity challenge response&quot;.
;Error reporting
:When a node detects an error, an error message is generated with an error code and is propagated upstream on the reverse path to the sender.
;Information on RSVP flow
:Two types of diagnostic messages allow a network operator to request the RSVP state information on a specific flow.
;Diagnostic facility
:An extension to the standard which allows a user to collect information about the RSVP state along a path.

<text>Horst Ludwig Georg Erich Wessel (9 October 1907 – 23 February 1930) was a member of the Sturmabteilung (SA), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, who became a propaganda symbol in Nazi Germany following his murder in 1930 by two members of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). After his death, Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels elevated him into a martyr for the Nazi Party.

Wessel first joined a number of youth groups and extreme right-wing paramilitary groups, but later resigned from them and joined the SA, the original paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party. He rose to command several SA squads and districts. On 14 January 1930, he was shot in the head by two Communists. Albrecht &quot;Ali&quot; Höhler was arrested and charged with his murder. Höhler was initially sentenced to six years in prison but was forcibly removed from jail and killed by the SA after the Nazis came to power in September 1933.

Wessel&#x27;s funeral was given wide attention in Berlin, with many of the Nazi elite in attendance. After his death, he became a propaganda symbol in Nazi Germany. A march for which he had written the lyrics was renamed the (&quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;), and became the official anthem of the Nazi Party. After Adolf Hitler came to national power in 1933, the song became the co-national anthem of Germany, along with the first verse of the previous , also known as .

== Early life ==

Horst Ludwig Georg Erich Wessel was born on 9 October 1907 in Bielefeld, Westphalia, the son of Wilhelm Ludwig Georg Wessel (born 15 July 1879), a Lutheran minister in Bielefeld, and later in Mülheim an der Ruhr, then at the Nikolai Church, one of Berlin&#x27;s oldest churches. Wessel&#x27;s mother, Bertha Luise Margarete Wessel (&quot;née&quot; Richter), also came from a family of Lutheran pastors. Wessel&#x27;s parents were married on 1 May 1906. He grew up alongside his sister Ingeborg Paula Margarethe (born 19 May 1909) and his brother Werner Georg Erich Ludwig (born 22 August 1910). When they moved from Mülheim to Berlin, the family lived in the Jüdenstraße.

Wessel attended four different secondary schools in Berlin: firstly the Köllnische Gymnasium from 1914 to 1922, then briefly the &#x27; and the Evangelisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster (&quot;Protestant Grey Cloister Gymnasium&quot;). For his final two years of schooling, he attended the &#x27;, where he passed his &quot;Abitur&quot; examination and which would later be renamed in his memory. On 19 April 1926, Wessel enrolled in Friedrich Wilhelm University to study law.

The Wessel family, influenced by the politics of the father, avidly supported the monarchist German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP), and when he was 15, Wessel joined the DNVP&#x27;s youth group &quot;Bismarckjugend&quot; (&quot;Bismarck Youth&quot;), from which he resigned in 1925. At the time, the DNVP was the most influential right-wing party.

Wessel soon began to frequent bars and hang out in flophouses, and also founded his own youth group, the &quot;Knappschaft&quot;, the purpose of which was to &quot;raise our boys to be real German men&quot;. He also joined the &quot;Wiking Liga&quot; (&quot;Viking League&quot;), a paramilitary group founded by Hermann Ehrhardt – the stated goal of which was to effect &quot;the revival of Germany on a national and ethnic basis through the spiritual education of its members&quot; – near the end of 1923. Wessel himself described the Viking League as having &quot;the ultimate aim&quot; of the &quot;establishment of a national dictatorship&quot;. He soon became a local leader, engaging in street battles with youth members of their adversarial groups, such as the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Communist Party (KPD).

Later, Wessel joined groups with a more sinister reputation, including the &quot;Olympia German Association for Physical Training&quot;, a powerful paramilitary group which was the successor of the disbanded Reinhard Regiment.

On 22 December 1929, Wessel&#x27;s brother Werner and three other members of the Sturmabteilung and Nazi Party froze to death on a skiing trip.

== Nazi Party member ==
=== Joining the SA ===
The Viking League and the Olympia Association were banned in Prussia in May 1926, when it was discovered they were planning a coup against the government. Realizing the League would not achieve its self-defined mission and was moving in the direction of tolerating the parliamentary political system, Wessel resigned from it on 23 November 1926 at age 19. Two weeks later, on 7 December, he joined the paramilitary &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (&quot;Storm Detachment&quot; or SA) of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party). He later commented that over two-thirds of his colleagues from the Viking League had already joined the SA and the Nazi Party.

Part of the attraction of the NSDAP to Wessel was Joseph Goebbels, the Party&#x27;s newly appointed &quot;Gauleiter&quot; (regional leader) of Berlin, about whom he would later say:

There was nothing [Goebbels] couldn&#x27;t handle. The party comrades clung to him with great devotion. The SA would have let itself be cut to pieces for him. Goebbels – he was like Hitler himself. Goebbels – he was &#x27;our&#x27; Goebbels.

Writing in his diaries – he kept two, one for his political life and one for other matters – Wessel described the differences between the groups he had been a part of, and the appeal of being involved in the Nazi Party:

Bismarck League, that was pleasure and enjoyment, the Viking League was adventure, the atmosphere of the coup, playing at soldiers, albeit against a background that was not without its dangers. But the NSDAP was a political awakening. ... The movement&#x27;s centrifugal force was tremendous. ... One meeting followed hard on the heels of the last one. ... Street demonstrations, recruiting drives in the press, propaganda trips into the provinces creating an atmosphere of activism and high political tension that could only help the movement.

It was Goebbels who had created this atmosphere, which prompted right-wing youth to leave organizations they felt had let them down for the excitement of the Nazi Party&#x27;s highly visible activism.

For a few years Wessel lived a double life, as a middle-class university law student and as a member of the primarily working-class SA, but in some ways the two worlds were converging in ideology. At university, Wessel joined a dueling society dedicated to &quot;steeling and testing physical and moral fitness&quot; through personal combat, while with the SA, which was always interested in a good street fight, he was immersed in the antisemitic attitudes typical of the extreme right-wing paramilitary culture of the time. His study of jurisprudence at school was seen through the filter of his belief that the application of the law was primarily an instrument of power; and his personal beliefs, already geared toward anti-Jewish attitudes, were further hardened by the novel &quot;From Double Eagle to Red Flag&quot; by White emigre General Pyotr Krasnov, which is set between the Russian Revolution of 1905 and the Red Guards&#x27; victory at the end of the Russian Civil War, and which was first published in the Weimar Republic in 1922. According to Wessel&#x27;s sister, General Krasnov&#x27;s novel was enormously influential upon her brother.

=== Activities ===
In August 1927, Wessel traveled in a group of fifty SA men to the Nazi Party rally in Nuremberg, which he described as &quot;Flags, enthusiasm, Hitler, all of Nuremberg a brown army camp. It made an enormous impression.&quot; Wessel was with other Berlin-based Nazis making up a group of 400, led by Goebbels. At that time the SA was banned in Berlin. When they returned, they were arrested.

Wessel soon impressed Goebbels; and in January 1928, a period in which the Berlin city authorities had banned the SA in an effort to curb political street violence, Wessel was sent to Vienna to study the National Socialist Youth Group, as well as the organizational and tactical methods of the Nazi Party there. He returned to Berlin in July 1928 to recruit local youths, and was involved in helping to implement a reorganization of the NSDAP in the city into a cell-structure similar to that used by the German Communist Party (KPD). Wessel did this despite SA rules forbidding its members from working for the Party.

In 1929, Wessel became the Street Cell Leader of the Alexanderplatz Storm Section of the SA. In May, he was appointed district leader of the SA for Friedrichshain where he lived, SA-Sturm 5. with the rank of &quot;Sturmführer&quot;. In October 1929, Wessel dropped out of university to devote himself full-time to the Nazi movement. In that same year, Wessel wrote the lyrics to &quot;Die Fahne hoch!&quot; (&quot;Raise the Flag!&quot;), which would later be known as the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;. Wessel wrote songs for the SA in conscious imitation of the Communist paramilitary, the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League – in fact, the music to &quot;Die Fahne hoch!&quot;&quot; was taken from a Communist song book – to provoke them into attacking his troops, and to keep up the spirits of his men. Wessel was recognized by Goebbels and the Berlin Nazi hierarchy as an effective street speaker; in the first 11 months of 1929, for instance, he spoke at 56 separate NSDAP events.

Wessel&#x27;s Friedrichshain Sturm 5 unit had a reputation as being &quot;a band of thugs, a brutal squad&quot;. One of his men described the way they fought against the Communists (KPD):

Horst made Adolf Hitler&#x27;s principle his own: terror can be destroyed only by counterterror ... The places where the KPD met were often visited by a mere handful of loyal supporters, and our standpoint was made unequivocally clear to the landlord and all who were present. In the East End [of Berlin] Horst Wessel opened up a route through which a brown storm tide poured in unceasingly and conquered the area inch by inch.

By the period 1929–30, the continual violence in Berlin between the street fighters of the Nazi Party and other extreme right-wing groups, and those of the Communist Party and other parties on the left, had become a virtual civil war the Prussian police were powerless to control. This physical violence was encouraged by Goebbels, the Nazi &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Berlin, to whom Hitler had given the difficult task of establishing a reorganized Nazi presence in &quot;Red Berlin&quot; – a city sympathetic to the Communists and the Socialists – one that was under the firm control of the Nazi Party headquarters in Munich and which was not controlled by the northern branch of the party under the Strasser brothers with their socialist leanings. Goebbels&#x27; violent approach was appreciated by Wessel, who preferred it to the official restraint he experienced as a member of the Bismarck Youth and the Viking League.

Wessel kept two journals, one specifically about his political life. In neither does he describe his physical participation in these street skirmishes: he refers to &quot;we&quot; – i.e. the SA – and not to &quot;I&quot;. Wessel had broken one arm several times while horseback riding as a schoolboy which deformed it, and had been given a permanent exemption from physical education. Nonetheless, he boxed and practiced martial arts while in the Viking League, and boasted in one journal of having mastered ju-jitsu, a primarily defensive art he may have needed to compensate for his lack of physical power. Still, the limitations of his physicality would have prevented him from taking as full a role in the street brawls, and he may therefore have ratcheted up his rhetoric in an attempt to compensate for his physical disability.

Wessel became well known among the Communists when – on orders from Goebbels – he led a number of SA incursions into the Fischerkiez, an extremely poor Berlin district where Communists mingled with underworld figures. Several of these agitations were only minor altercations, but one took place outside the tavern which the local Communist Party (KPD) used as its headquarters. As a result of that melée, five Communists were injured, four of them seriously. The Communist newspaper accused the police of letting the Nazis get away but arresting the injured Communists, while the Nazi newspaper claimed that Wessel had been trying to give a speech when shadowy figures emerged and started the fight. Wessel was marked for death by the KPD, with his face and address featured on street posters. The slogan of the KPD and the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League became &quot;Strike the fascists wherever you find them&quot;.

=== Erna Jänicke ===
In September 1929 Wessel met , a 23-year-old ex-prostitute, in a tavern not far from Alexanderplatz. Later sources claim Wessel earned money as Jänicke&#x27;s procurer, however this has never been substantiated. On 1 November, she moved into his room on the third floor of 62 Große Frankfurter Straße (today Karl-Marx-Allee), which he sublet from 29-year-old Elisabeth Salm, whose late husband had been an active Communist Red Front Fighter, although she described herself as apolitical. After a few months, there was a dispute between Salm and Wessel over unpaid rent in which Salm claimed that Wessel had threatened her. The landlady may have feared that she could lose her legal rights to the apartment, which she rented and did not own, if Jänicke, who she assumed was a working prostitute, was found to be living there. (She had already been in danger of losing her legal claim when she moved out of Berlin to live, and then had to move back because she found out that living in Berlin was a legal requirement.) She asked Jänicke to leave but the latter refused. Salm stated that after having a “quiet word” with Wessel, she agreed to have the couple move out by February 1st, but then changed her mind and wanted the two tenants out immediately. A few hours later on the evening of 14 January 1930, Salm appealed to Communist friends of her late husband for help.
At first, the Communists were not interested in helping Salm, as she was not well-liked by them because she had given her husband a church funeral instead of allowing the KPD to give him the standard burial rite used for members of the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League. Nevertheless, when they realized that Horst Wessel was involved in the dispute, they agreed to beat him up and get him out of Salm&#x27;s flat by force. Knowing they needed muscle, they sent word to a nearby tavern for Albrecht &quot;Ali&quot; Höhler, an armed pimp, perjurer and petty criminal. Höhler, a heavily tattooed cabinetmaker who had recently been released from prison, was a Communist and a member of the Red Front Fighters&#x27; League.

== Death ==
At around 10 p.m. on 14 January 1930, Höhler and Erwin Rückert, another member of the KPD, knocked at the door of the room where Wessel and Jänicke lived, while the remainder of the gang of at least a dozen men waited on the street outside. When Wessel, who was expecting a visit from the leader of another SA Sturm group, opened the door, he was almost immediately shot at point-blank range. Although it was later claimed that Wessel had attempted to draw a gun and so had been shot in self-defense, this was denied by eyewitnesses, who said that he had been given no time to react. The attackers searched the room, removed a pistol from the wardrobe and a rubber truncheon, and fled the scene, returning to the rest of the men in the street. The entire group then returned to their usual nighttime activities.

Even as Wessel was lying seriously wounded in hospital, Goebbels was already releasing reports asserting that those who had carried out the attack were &quot;degenerate communist subhumans&quot;. Wessel received medical attention and recovered somewhat, but eventually died in hospital on 23 February from sepsis contracted in hospital.

Following his death, the National Socialists and the Communists offered different accounts of the events. The police, led by Chief Inspector Teichmann, and several courts determined that both political and private reasons had led to Wessel&#x27;s assassination. By 17 January 1930, the police had announced that Höhler, whom Jänicke had identified as the gunman, was their prime suspect.

It was then reported by a non-Nazi and non-Communist newspaper that Jänicke had known Höhler prior to the murder because Wessel had used her to spy on those of her former clients who were Communists. The Communists, in turn, claimed that Höhler had been Jänicke&#x27;s pimp until Wessel stole her from him, and that this was the motive behind the shooting. Jänicke denied these stories, saying that she had never been a spy for Wessel, and that she knew Höhler only as an &quot;acquaintance from the streets&quot;. The police and courts believed her, and Höhler was quickly arrested. After a trial, he was sentenced to six years&#x27; imprisonment for the shooting; the light sentence was the result of the court&#x27;s finding of extenuating circumstances. Seven accomplices were also found guilty and sentenced to jail.

=== Executions ===
Three years later, after the Nazi ascension to national power in 1933, Höhler was taken out of prison under false pretenses by then Gestapo chief Rudolf Diels and members of the SA, and illegally executed.

On 10 April 1935, five years after Wessel&#x27;s assassination, and two years after the SA murder of Höhler, two people accused of being involved in Wessel&#x27;s killing were put on trial and subsequently beheaded in Berlin&#x27;s Plötzensee Prison: Sally Epstein, a Jewish painter, and Hans Ziegler, a barber. The two had been arrested in August 1933, and were put on trial in May 1934 with a third defendant, Peter Stoll, a tailor. In 2009, the sentences against all three of them were rescinded by the Berlin public prosecutor&#x27;s office.

=== Funeral ===
Goebbels had been looking for someone to turn into a martyr for the Nazi cause. His first attempt was with Albert Leo Schlageter, a &quot;Freikorps&quot; member and saboteur, who was caught attempting to blow up a train in the Ruhr region, which at the time was occupied by French troops in retaliation for Germany&#x27;s not adhering to its schedule of reparation payments. Schlageter had been executed by the French and his grave later became a Nazi shrine. There were also the 16 Nazis who had died during the Beer Hall Putsch, and who were honored with a public ceremony every year on the anniversary of the Putsch. A memorial, which passers-by had to salute, was built for them in Munich. With two other party members who headed the list that the party later made of &quot;Those Members of the Movement Who Have Been Murdered&quot;, Goebbels did not even make an effort to martyr them.

Goebbels saw in Wessel&#x27;s shooting the possibility of a propaganda bonanza. He eulogized Wessel in his newspaper, &quot;Der Angriff&quot;, in overtly Christian tones:

A Christian Socialist! A man who calls out through his deeds: &#x27;Come to me, I shall redeem you!&#x27; ... A divine element works in him. making him the man he is and causing him to act in this way and no other. One man must set an example and offer himself up as a sacrifice! Well, then, I am ready!

Goebbel&#x27;s plan was to turn Wessel&#x27;s funeral into a mass demonstration full of speeches and processions of SA men in uniform, but he could not get the necessary police permits to do so, even after Wessel&#x27;s sister requested President Paul von Hindenburg to relent.

Wessel was buried in Berlin on 1 March 1930. Contrary to Nazi claims, there were no attacks on the funeral procession, which Goebbels claimed was watched by 30,000 people. The funeral was filmed and turned into a major propaganda event by the Nazi Party. Wessel was elevated by Goebbels&#x27; propaganda apparatus to the status of a leading martyr of the Nazi movement. Many of Goebbels&#x27;s most effective propaganda speeches were made at gravesides, but Wessel received unusual attention among the many unremembered storm troopers. In an editorial in the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Observer&quot;), Alfred Rosenberg wrote that Wessel was not dead, but had joined a combat group that still struggled alongside them; afterwards, Nazis spoke of how a man who died in conflict had joined &quot;Horst Wessel&#x27;s combat group&quot; or had been &quot;summoned to Horst Wessel&#x27;s standard&quot;. The Prussian police had outlawed public gatherings and the display of swastikas at the funeral procession, with the exception of a few Nazi Party vehicles. Wessel&#x27;s coffin was paraded through large parts of the center of Berlin in a procession lasting many hours.

As the coffin reached Bülowplatz (now Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz), Communist hecklers began singing &quot;The Internationale&quot; in an attempt to disrupt the event. The police were unable to prevent abusive shouts and, at some points, flying rocks. No major clashes occurred, although someone had written &quot;To Wessel the pimp, a last Heil Hitler&quot; in white paint on the cemetery wall.

In attendance at Wessel&#x27;s funeral were Goebbels, who delivered the eulogy, Franz Pfeffer von Salomon, Hermann Göring, and Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. Prior to the event, Goebbels and Göring had discussed the possibility of Hitler attending. In his diary entry on the day of the funeral, Goebbels recalled: &quot;Hitler isn&#x27;t coming. Had the situation explained to him over the telephone and he actually declined. Oh well&quot;. Goebbels blamed Rudolf Hess for dissuading Hitler from coming, but, in reality, Hitler&#x27;s decision was based on Göring&#x27;s advice that the danger of an attack on him in the heart of &quot;Red Berlin&quot; was too great.

== Nazi martyr ==

Although Goebbels could not persuade Hitler to attend Wessel&#x27;s funeral, Hitler did speak at Wessel&#x27;s grave three years after his death, on 22 January 1933, for the dedication of a memorial. The memorial, which was cubic in design, had a metal leaning flag and wreath on the top, and featured Horst&#x27;s name on the front, and on the back featured both the name of Horst&#x27;s father Ludwig, and the name for Horst&#x27;s brother Werner. Hitler called Wessel a &quot;blood witness&quot; whose song had become &quot;a battle hymn for millions&quot;. He said that Wessel&#x27;s sacrifice of his life was &quot;a monument more lasting than stone and bronze&quot;.

Sixteen thousand members of the Berlin and Brandenburg SA and SS marched past the Communist Party headquarters on Bülowplatz (now the Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz) – the Karl Liebknecht House – in a deliberately provocative act that Goebbels was very proud of having staged, calling it a &quot;terrible defeat&quot; for the Communists and &quot;a proud and heroic victory of the SA on behalf of the party&quot;. He felt that the Communists had &quot;a loss of prestige that could never again be made good&quot;, as they were relegated to fuming on the side streets. Once the &quot;enormous procession ... led by Hitler, Goebbels, Ernst Röhm, and other top officials of the [party], ... marched to the St. Nicholas Cemetery ... Hitler spoke of Wessel&#x27;s death as a symbolic sacrifice.&quot;

That night, Hitler addressed a memorial service at the Berlin Sportpalast, at which the &quot;Funeral March&quot; from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; was played, and the stage was set as an altar made from &quot;laurel trees, branches, candelabra and a larger-than-lifesize portrait of Wessel&quot;. Hitler lavished praise on &quot;those fanatics who are consumed by the great task of their age&quot; – &quot;fanaticism&quot; being a positive virtue among the Nazis – &quot;who live for that task and who die for it ... [they would] later be not only the martyrs of their struggle but also the seed from which the subsequent harvest [would come]&quot;.

Three months later, on 21 March 1933, elaborate celebrations organized by Goebbels were held on Potsdam Day for the inauguration of a new Reichstag. The day began with services at both the Catholic and Lutheran churches there, but Hitler and Goebbels did not attend. Instead, they laid wreaths at the graves of various Nazi &quot;martyrs of the revolution&quot;, including Wessel&#x27;s.

The death of Wessel and the proliferation of the &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; was an extension of the Nazi cult of martyrs, which included Freikorps member Leo Schlageter and the 15 Nazis and one bystander killed in the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923, who were reburied in Munich with great fanfare on 8 November 1935.

For years, Goebbels continued to use Wessel&#x27;s &quot;martyrdom&quot; as propaganda. At the 1934 Nuremberg Party Rally, a group of Hitler Youth sang an anti-Christian song which included the lines &quot;We don&#x27;t need any Christian truth ... We follow not Christ but Horst Wessel&quot;. Wessel&#x27;s name was frequently invoked by the Nazis to bolster the core tenets of National Socialist ideology during the remaining existence of Nazi Germany. For example, a wartime article from the Nazi-owned &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; newspaper called Wessel &quot;the hero of the Brown Revolution&quot; and referred to his &quot;sacrificial death&quot; that &quot;passionately inflamed millions who followed&quot;. The paper further referred to Wessel as &quot;the driving force behind the struggle for freedom of the armed services and the homeland of the Greater German Reich&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
=== &quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot; ===

Wessel played the schalmei (Martinstrompete), a brass instrument which featured in groups called &quot;Schalmeienkapellen&quot; (&quot;Schalmeien orchestras or bands&quot;), and which is still used in folk celebrations. Wessel founded an &quot;SA Schalmeienkapelle&quot; band, which provided music during SA events. In early 1929, Wessel wrote the lyrics for a new Nazi fight song &quot;Kampflied&quot; (&quot;fight song&quot;), which was first published in Goebbels&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Der Angriff&quot; in September, under the title &quot;Der Unbekannte SA-Mann&quot; (&quot;The Unknown SA-Man&quot;). The song later became known as &quot;Die Fahne Hoch&quot; (&quot;Raise the Flag&quot;) and finally the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Horst Wessel Song&quot;). The Nazis made it their official anthem and, after they came to power, the co-national anthem of Nazi Germany, along with the first stanza of the . The song was also played in some Protestant places of worship, as elements of the Protestant Church in Germany had accepted and promulgated the Horst Wessel cult, built as it was by Goebbels on the model of past Christian martyrs.

It was later claimed by the Nazis that Wessel also wrote the music to the song, but it was considered more likely that the tune was in reality adapted from a World War I German Imperial Navy song, and was probably originally a folk song. A German court finally determined in 1937 that Wessel was not the composer of the melody.

=== Posthumous notability ===
==== &quot;Hans Westmar&quot; ====
&quot;Hans Westmar: One of the Many&quot; was one of the first films of the Nazi era to idealize a version of Wessel&#x27;s life. Goebbels, however, disliked the film, considering it to be crude in its use of propaganda, and on the day of its intended premiere issued a ban prohibiting it from being shown. Putzi Hanfstaengl – an old friend of Hitler&#x27;s – who was one of the film&#x27;s backers, and had composed its music, went personally to Hitler and Goebbels to complain about the ban, which was eventually reversed when enough of the Nazi Party hierarchy weighed in on Hanfstaengl&#x27;s side. Goebbels, however, insisted on alterations to the film, the primary one being that the main character&#x27;s name was changed to the fictional &quot;Hans Westmar&quot;. Part of the problem with the film was that the authentic depiction of stormtrooper brutality, including violent clashes with Communists, did not fit the more reasonable tone the Nazis initially attempted to present after coming to power; unlike Wessel, Westmar preaches class reconciliation and does not alienate his family. It was among the first films to associate dying for Hitler as a glorious death for Germany, resulting in his spirit inspiring his comrades.

==== Memorial namings ====

The Berlin district of Friedrichshain, where Wessel died, was renamed &quot;Horst Wessel Stadt&quot;, and the Bülowplatz in the Mitte district was renamed &quot;Horst-Wessel-Platz&quot; on 26 May 1933. The U-Bahn station nearby was also renamed. After the war, the name Friedrichshain was restored and Horst-Wessel-Platz (which was in East Berlin) became &quot;Liebknechtplatz&quot; (after Karl Liebknecht). In 1947 it was renamed &quot;Luxemburg-Platz&quot; after Rosa Luxemburg (it has been called Rosa-Luxemburg-Platz since 1969). Passau named a street &quot;Horst-Wessel-Straße&quot;.

In 1936, Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (navy) commissioned a three-masted training ship and named her the &quot;Horst Wessel&quot;. The ship was taken as a war prize by the United States after World War II. After repairs and modifications, it was commissioned on 15 May 1946 into the United States Coast Guard as the USCGC &quot;Eagle&quot; (WIX-327) and remains in service to this day.

In 1938, an area of reclaimed land in the rural area of Eiderstedt in Schleswig-Holstein was named the &quot;Horst Wessel polder&quot;. A year later, the school in Berlin where Wessel completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; examinations was renamed Horst-Wessel-Gymnasium.

Examples of German military units adopting the name of this Nazi-era &quot;martyr&quot; in World War II include the 18th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division, known as the &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; Division, and the Luftwaffe&#x27;s 26th Destroyer (or heavy fighter) Wing &quot;Zerstörergeschwader 26&quot;, as well as its successor day fighter unit &quot;Jagdgeschwader 6&quot;, which was similarly named the &quot;Horst Wessel&quot; wing. The Jagdgeschwader 134, formed in 1936, and Jagdgeschwader 142 were also named after Wessel. In 1938, the Nazi Party&#x27;s Central Publishing House, the Franz Eher Nachfolger Verlag in Munich, published &quot;Jagdgeschwader Horst Wessel&quot; (&quot;Horst Wessel Fighter Squadron&quot;) by &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Hans Peter Hermel to commemorate the presentation of the squadron to Hitler.

==== Post-war ====
After World War II, Wessel&#x27;s memorial was vandalized and his remains and the remains of his brother Werner were exhumed and destroyed (the remains of Wessel&#x27;s father, Ludwig, were left interred). Such activity became common for buried Nazis in East Germany. Much of the memorial grave marker was cut off, removing the metal above, and the names of Wessel and his brother Werner. Afterwards, the gravesite was long marked only by the remaining part of the grave marker, which had been partly recarved and was in use as the headstone of Wessel&#x27;s father, Ludwig, albeit which the surname &quot;Wessel&quot; removed. In 2000, a group of anti-fascists claimed to have opened up the grave and thrown his skull into the nearby Spree river. Berlin police later said that the grave had not been disturbed and that no remains had been removed. Later in 2011, a group of anti-Nazi activists attacked Wessel&#x27;s grave and sprayed the words &quot;Keine Ruhe für Nazis!&quot; (&quot;No Rest for Nazis!&quot;) on the remains of the grave marker.

In August 2013, the grave marker was removed and the grave of Wessel&#x27;s father was leveled as well, as the church wished to stop the site from being a rally point for Neo-Nazis. Since 1989, two petitions have been filed asking that Wessel&#x27;s gravestone be rebuilt and restored to the St. Nicholas Cemetery. Both were denied.

In the modern era, some Neo-Nazi groups have attempted to revive Wessel&#x27;s name as a symbol. The Young National Democrats (JN), which is the youth wing of the National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD), has previously used his name to attempt to inspire their members.

<doc id="618195" wikidata="Q1801005" url="?curid=618195" title="Lake Meredith">
<text>Lake Meredith is a reservoir formed by Sanford Dam on the Canadian River at Sanford, Texas. It is about northeast of Amarillo, Texas in the Texas Panhandle. It is named for A.A. Meredith, the former city manager of Borger, Texas. It historically was a major source of drinking water for Amarillo and Lubbock, Texas, located about to the south along with many other towns in between and nearby. Sanford Dam was constructed starting in 1962 with completion in 1965. In 2003, the Canadian River Municipal Water Authority announced that it would reduce allocations to its member cities due to an ongoing drought and a continued drop in the water level in the reservoir. As of 2008, the lake continued to hit record lows, and most of the water supplied by CRMWA is now coming from wells in Roberts County. In 2011, water withdrawals from Lake Meredith temporarily ceased and on August 7, 2013 the lake reached its all-time low . The record high capacity was in April 1973 when the lake was 101.85 ft deep. Lake depth as of October 14, 2017 was 73.12 ft deep.

Lake depth as of June 17, 2019 was 77.03 ft deep.

On June 1, 2008 the remains of a Beechcraft Skipper airplane were found in the receding lake. The plane, reported missing on January 27, 1984, was on a two-hour flight carrying the pilot, Steven Lampe, 25 and Larry Lucas, both of Amarillo, Texas. There had been no eyewitnesses to the crash.

Much of the political credit for the establishment of Lake Meredith has gone to the late State Senator Grady Hazlewood of Amarillo.

==Recreational activities==
Since its designation as a National Recreation Area, Lake Meredith has been an attraction for various recreational activities, including camping, fishing, and water sports of all types. Its long narrow profile and numerous coves make power boat sports (water skiing, tubing, wake boarding, etc.) especially popular. Due to the region&#x27;s normally windy summer seasons, the coves are popular spots for such water sports due to their natural protection from the winds that often make the open lake waters too choppy for these activities. It also features camping at several sites around the lake, along with five beach areas, one accessible only by boat. Fishing stock includes sand bass and walleye. Anglers may also hope to land several other desirable species of fish such as crappie, perch, carp, large mouth bass, and small mouth bass. The drought from 2011-2013 took a big toll, not only on the water level, but also on the local economy of Fritch, Texas. Lake Meredith is now enjoying recovery due to consecutive rainy seasons since 2014. The reservoir’s water level has risen over fifty feet since the record low was set on August 7, 2013.

Boat ramps are located at Sanford Yake, Cedar Canyon, Fritch Fortress, Harbor Bay, and Blue West. All ramps are open as of June 17, 2019.

<text>NSCAD University, also known as the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design (NSCAD), is a public art university in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The university is a co-educational institution that offers bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees. The university also provides continuing education services through its School of Extended Studies.

The institution was founded by Anna Leonowens in 1887 as the Victoria School of Art and Design. The school was later renamed the Nova Scotia College of Art in 1925. In 1969, the institution was renamed the &quot;Nova Scotia College of Art and Design&quot; and began to offer undergraduate degrees, becoming the first degree-granting art school in the country. The institution adopted its current name in 2003.

==History==


===19th century===
The university opened in the Union Building in 1887. It was founded by Anna Leonowens (of &quot;Anna and the King of Siam&quot; fame). It was originally called the Victoria School of Art and Design to commemorate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee. It moved to the Halifax Academy in 1890. From 1898 to 1910, Henry Mortikar Rosenberg was the principal.

===20th century===
In 1903 the school moved to the old National School. In 1925, it was renamed the Nova Scotia College of Art under the leadership of its president Dr. Frederick Sexton.

One of the notable artists to be associated with the school in its early years was Arthur Lismer, who was a member of the Group of Seven and spent several years as the school president. Elizabeth Styring Nutt succeeded Lismar as president in 1919, serving until 1943.

New Brunswick-born artist Donald Cameron MacKay, who prior to World War II had been vice-principal, after war service assumed the role of principal and continued until retiring in 1971. Under his supervision, in 1957 the school moved into the former St. Andrew&#x27;s United Church on Coburg Road. A modern, five-storey addition was constructed in 1968. It was eventually razed to provide space for Dalhousie University&#x27;s Mona Campbell Building.
The artist Garry Kennedy was appointed president in 1967 at the age of 31, becoming the youngest ever president of a Canadian university. He immediately moved to remake the college from a provincial art school into an international centre for artistic activity. He invited notable artists to come to NSCAD as visiting artists, particularly those involved in conceptual art. Artists who made significant contributions during this period include Vito Acconci, Sol LeWitt, Dan Graham, Eric Fischl, Lawrence Weiner, Joseph Beuys and Claes Oldenburg. The school was renamed the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 1969, the same year it began granting undergraduate degrees. Kennedy is credited with transforming the school into an internationally recognised centre for cutting-edge art, with &quot;Art in America&quot; suggesting in 1973 that NSCAD was &quot;the best art school in North America&quot;.

The school began to offer graduate programs in 1973. It moved to its current location on Granville Mall in 1978 and the former Coburg Road campus was acquired by Dalhousie University. Garry Kennedy retired from the school&#x27;s presidency in 1990 to focus on teaching and making art.

===21st century===
In 2002 the school purchased the Granville Street block of heritage buildings it had leased since 1978, known today as the Fountain Campus. The institution was renamed NSCAD University in 2003. It opened a second campus, the Academy Building, in 2004. This campus houses the film studies faculty. In 2007 the third campus, the Port Campus, opened at the Halifax Seaport. All three campuses are located in downtown Halifax.

The construction of the Port Campus brought the school&#x27;s debt to a high of $19 million in 2011 after funding from the federal government fell through. The province asked the school to draw up a plan to reduce the debt, and it was speculated that NSCAD might lose its autonomy. NSCAD students, faculty and alumni mounted a &quot;Save NSCAD&quot; campaign in opposition to a merger with a larger institution. The school commissioned a report to study the idea, but the consultant found that a merger would not result in cost savings. The NSCAD board of governors therefore voted on 15 July 2014 to continue as an independent university. The university&#x27;s financial position subsequently improved, and the debt had been reduced to $13 million as of 2015.

==Academics==
NSCAD offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in Fine Art (BFA), Design (BDes), and Art History (BA). It also offers Master of Fine Arts, Master of Design, and Master of Arts in Art Education degrees at the graduate level.

==Library and galleries==

The NSCAD University Library was founded early in the school&#x27;s history and is now located in the Fountain Campus. It is the only art and design library in Atlantic Canada. Its collection includes over 50,000 books and periodicals as well as the Visual Resources Collection, which comprises 140,000 slides, 16mm films, video tapes and other multimedia materials. The library is a member of Novanet, which facilitates inter-library loans between Nova Scotian academic libraries.

Historical fine arts and ceramics; contemporary fine arts and printmaking collections are housed in the Anna Leonowens Gallery, founded in 1968. The gallery hosts exhibitions of the work of undergraduate and graduate students, faculty members, visiting artists and curators. The Port Campus hosts the Treaty Space Gallery and Port Loggia Gallery.

The university was also formerly home to the Seeds Gallery, a non-profit gallery where students and alumni could show and sell their work. This made NSCAD the only art school in Canada to offer a dedicated commercial gallery, helping students tradition from academia to entrepreneurship. It was founded by SUNSCAD, the students&#x27; union, who turned over control of the gallery to the university in 2007. In 2011 the university moved the gallery from Hollis Street to a more peripheral location at the Seaport, where it had to pay rent for the first time. The new space was a gallery in the Annex Building, directly across the street from the Port Campus.

In September 2013 the university board of governors decided to close the Seeds Gallery on 31 March 2014. The university governance stated that closure was a cost-saving measure in light of the gallery&#x27;s $40,000 yearly deficit. The students&#x27; union criticized the absence of consultation surrounding the decision and blamed the gallery&#x27;s financial woes on the decision to relocate it to the Seaport. It stated that the gallery had been on the path to financial sustainability while at Hollis Street.

In January 2016 the Anna Leonowens Gallery founded the Art Bar + Projects, a space for performance art.

==School of Extended Studies==
NSCAD has a long and distinguished history of offering the public the opportunity to study in a visual arts environment. The School of Extended Studies continues this tradition by offering the public a wide variety of non-credit studio and audit lecture courses in fine arts, media arts, craft and design. The School also manages the 30-credit Visual Arts Certificate for Teachers program, the 30-credit Visual Arts Certificate in Studio and the pre-university summer study credit program. Credit programs have admission requirements. Noncredit programs have no admission requirements although prerequisites must be met for some courses.

=== Adult Programs ===
The adult studio-based and audit lecture courses are available to individuals who are 16 years or older. These courses are designed to meet personal and professional development interests and to prepare for studies in an undergraduate visual arts degree program. Curricula incorporate skills, processes, and health and safety issues. New approaches and ways of seeing, analyzing, experimenting and problem solving through observation are promoted. To ensure program quality, planning is ongoing with other areas of NSCAD University. New courses are added regularly to introduce different subject matter and in response to public demand.

=== Children and Teen Programs ===
Saturday Children&#x27;s Art Classes began in 1887 and are one of the earliest known examples of such programs in North America. Children in grades 1 – 6 participate in a variety of fun age-appropriate activities that introduce basic visual arts skills.

Teen Art Studio courses for students in Grades 7 -12 introduce fundamental visual art skills and processes, introduce NSCAD facilities and provide older teens an opportunity to build a portfolio for admission to an undergraduate visual arts degree program. Saturday youth courses for ages 5–18 are offered during the spring, fall, and winter terms, and week-long camps are offered during summer. Week-long March Break camps are offered during the Provincial school break.

=== Night Shift Exhibit ===
An annual Night Shift Exhibition to display student work completed in Extended Studies course is held in the Anna Leonowens Gallery located on the NSCAD Granville campus. Family and friends are encouraged to attend this popular exhibit and enjoy a variety of different works of art created by all ages.

==University press==
Under the direction of Kennedy, The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design was established as a vehicle to publish books by and about leading contemporary artists. The Press was important in establishing the university&#x27;s international reputation. Between 1972 and 1987, 26 titles by such artists as Michael Snow, Steve Reich, Gerhard Richter and Yvonne Rainer were published. The Press re-launched in 2002.

<doc id="618211" wikidata="Q17051823" url="?curid=618211" title="Prime Minister of Cameroon">
<text>Under the current Constitution of Cameroon, the prime minister of Cameroon is a relatively powerless position. While the prime minister is officially appointed to be the head of government, the president retains most of the executive power and can fire the prime minister at will.

The current prime minister, Joseph Ngute, was appointed by President Paul Biya. He took the office on 4 January 2019.

==History==
The position has existed in the eastern part of Cameroon since it gained its independence from France in 1960. When the western part gained independence from the British in 1961, the two halves of the Federal Republic of Cameroon, East Cameroon and West Cameroon, maintained their autonomy and each had a separate prime minister. In 1972, Cameroon became a unitary state and the position of prime minister was temporarily unfilled. In 1975, Paul Biya was appointed as prime minister for all of Cameroon. After Biya&#x27;s succession to the presidency, the post of prime minister did not exist from 1984 to 1991.

<doc id="618214" wikidata="Q16245569" url="?curid=618214" title="Cameron, Ontario">
<text>Cameron is an unincorporated village in the City of Kawartha Lakes, in east-central Ontario, Canada. The village has a population of approximately 221 residents. Cameron is located at the junction of Highway 35, and Kawartha Lakes Road 34, 11 km north-west of Lindsay.

==History==
Cameron, formerly part of Fenelon Township in Victoria County, was a busy village in the 19th century with a blacksmith, grave stone manufacturer, hotel, school, telegraph office and post office. Today, the post office, general store, Fenelon Township Elementary School, and Cameron Community Church are all located within the hub of the community. Cameron&#x27;s main attraction is recreational fishing. Particularly in the hamlet of Long Beach on Sturgeon Lake.

Cameron is believed to be the site where Samuel de Champlain fought a battle with First Nations Peoples in 1613. It has been known as Cameron Line and Cameron Settlement.

While some say Cameron was named for Duncan Cameron, an early settler, others contend it was named for Chief Justice Sir Matthew Crooks Cameron, MPP and provincial secretary and commissioner of Crown lands, who died in 1887.

== Education ==

=== Public school ===
The construction of schools began in the 1840s. As the population grew, a variety of Section Schools (S.S.)were opened. Eventually S.S. 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, &amp; 10 were closed and sold upon the opening of Fenelon Township Public School in 1967. Additions to the current school building over the years have included an extension on the primary wing, a library-resource centre. The school has utilized 4 portable classrooms for many years.

A detailed history of the Cameron school can be found in Jim McKechnie&#x27;s 1980 M.S. Graduate Studies essay, &quot;Cameron School&quot;. Further information on the history of Fenelon Township&#x27;s schools can be found in &quot;A History of Fenelon Township, 1987&quot;.

The original school house is now owned by Cameron Community Church and used for many community functions.
