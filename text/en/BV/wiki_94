<text>Stuart Orlando Scott (July 19, 1965 – January 4, 2015) was an American sportscaster and anchor on ESPN, including on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. Known for his hip-hop style and use of catchphrases, Scott was also a regular for the network in its National Basketball Association (NBA) and National Football League (NFL) coverage.

Scott was born in Chicago and resided in the back of London Towne Houses on Chicago&#x27;s Southeast side. After relocating to North Carolina in his youth, Scott graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He began his career with various local television stations before joining ESPN in 1993. Although there were already accomplished African-American sportscasters, his blending of hip hop with sportscasting was unique for television. By 2008, he was a staple in ESPN&#x27;s programming, and also began on ABC as lead host for their coverage of the NBA.

In 2007, Scott had an appendectomy and learned that his appendix was cancerous. After going into remission, he was again diagnosed with cancer in 2011 and 2013. Scott was honored at the ESPY Awards in 2014 with the Jimmy V Award for his fight against cancer, less than six months before his death in 2015 at age 49.

==Early life==
Stuart Orlando Scott was born in Chicago, Illinois on July 19, 1965. His parents were O. Ray and Jacqueline Scott. When he was 7, Scott and his family moved to Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Scott had a brother named Stephen and two sisters named Susan and Synthia.

He attended Mount Tabor High School for 9th and 10th grade and then completed his last two years at Richard J. Reynolds High School in Winston-Salem, graduating in 1983. In high school, he was a captain of his football team, ran track, served as Vice President of the Student Council, and was the Sergeant at Arms of the school&#x27;s Key Club. Scott was inducted into the Richard J. Reynolds High School Hall of Fame during a ceremony on February 6, 2015, which took place during the Reynolds/Mt. Tabor (the two high schools that Scott attended) basketball game.

He attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a member of the Mu Zeta Chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and was part of the on-air talent at WXYC. While at UNC, Scott also played wide receiver and defensive back on the football team. In 1987, Scott graduated from the UNC with a B.A. in speech communication. In 2001, Scott gave the commencement address at UNC.

==Career==
Following graduation, Scott worked as a news reporter and weekend sports anchor at WPDE-TV in Florence, South Carolina from 1987 until 1988. Scott came up with the phrase &quot;as cool as the other side of the pillow&quot; while working his first job at WPDE. After this, Scott worked as a news reporter at WRAL-TV 5 in Raleigh, North Carolina from 1988 until 1990. WRAL Sports anchor Jeff Gravley recalled there was a &quot;natural bond&quot; between Scott and the sports department. Gravley described his style as creative, gregarious and adding so much energy to the newsroom. Even after leaving, Scott still visited his former colleagues at WRAL and treated them like family.

From 1990 until 1993, Scott worked at WESH, an NBC affiliate in Orlando, Florida as a sports reporter and sports anchor. While at WESH, he met ESPN producer Gus Ramsey, who was beginning his own career. Ramsey said of Scott: &quot;You knew the second he walked in the door that it was a pit stop, and that he was gonna be this big star somewhere someday. He went out and did a piece on the rodeo, and he nailed it just like he would nail the NBA Finals for ESPN.&quot; He earned first place honors from the Central Florida Press Club for a feature on rodeo.

==ESPN==
Al Jaffe, ESPN&#x27;s vice president for talent, brought Scott to ESPN2 because they were looking for sportscasters who might appeal to a younger audience. Scott became one of the few African-American personalities who was not a former professional athlete. His first ESPN assignments were for &quot;SportsSmash&quot;, a short sportscast twice an hour on ESPN2&#x27;s &quot;SportsNight&quot; program. After Keith Olbermann left &quot;SportsNight&quot; for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, Scott took his place in the anchor chair at &quot;SportsNight&quot;. After this, Scott was a regular on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. At &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, Scott was frequently teamed with fellow anchors Steve Levy, Kenny Mayne, Dan Patrick, and Rich Eisen. Scott was a regular in the &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; commercials.

In 2002, Scott was named studio host for the &quot;NBA on ESPN&quot;. He became lead host in 2008, when he also began at ABC in the same capacity for its NBA coverage, which included the NBA Finals. Additionally, Scott anchored &quot;SportsCenter&quot;″s prime-time coverage from the site of NBA post-season games. From 1997 until 2014, he covered the league&#x27;s finals. During the 1997 and 1998 NBA Finals, Scott did one-on-one interviews with Michael Jordan. When &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; moved to ESPN in 2006, Scott hosted on-site coverage, including &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot; and post-game &quot;SportsCenter&quot; coverage. Scott previously appeared on &quot;NFL Primetime&quot; during the 1997 season, &quot;Monday Night Countdown&quot; from 2002 to 2005, and &quot;Sunday NFL Countdown&quot; from 1999 to 2001. Scott also covered the MLB playoffs and NCAA Final Four in 1995 for ESPN.

Scott appeared in each issue of &quot;ESPN the Magazine&quot;, with his &quot;Holla&quot; column. During his work at ESPN, he also interviewed Tiger Woods, Sammy Sosa, President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign. As a part of the interview with President Barack Obama, Scott played in a one-on-one basketball game with the President. In 2004, per the request of U.S. troops, Scott and fellow &quot;SportsCenter&quot; co-anchors hosted a week of programs originating from Kuwait for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter: Salute the Troops&quot;. He hosted a number of ESPN game and reality shows, including &quot;Stump the Schwab&quot;, &quot;Teammates&quot;, and &quot;Dream Job&quot;, and hosted David Blaine&#x27;s &quot;Drowned Alive&quot; special. He hosted a special and only broadcast episode of &quot;America&#x27;s Funniest Home Videos&quot; called &quot;AFV: The Sports Edition&quot;.

===Style===
While there were already successful African-American sportscasters, Scott blended hip-hop culture and sports in a way that had never been seen before on television. He talked in the same manner as fans would at home. ESPN director of news Vince Doria told ABC: &quot;But Stuart spoke a much different language ... that appealed to a young demographic, particularly a young African-American demographic.&quot; Michael Wilbon wrote that Scott allowed his personality to infuse the coverage and his emotion to pour out.

Scott also integrated pop culture references into his reports. One commentator remembered his style: &quot;he could go from evoking a Baptist preacher riffing during Sunday morning service (&#x27;Can I get a witness from the congregation?!&#x27;), to quoting Public Enemy frontman Chuck D (&#x27;Hear the drummer get WICKED!&#x27;) In 1999, he was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; by Tim Meadows. Scott appeared in music videos with the rappers LL Cool J and Luke, and he was cited in &quot;3 Peat&quot;, a Lil Wayne song that included the line: &quot;Yeah, I got game like Stuart Scott, fresh out the ESPN shop.&quot; In a 2002 segment of NPR&#x27;s &quot;On the Media&quot;, Scott revealed one approach to his anchoring duties: &quot;Writing is better if it&#x27;s kept simple. Every sentence doesn&#x27;t need to have perfect noun/verb agreement. I&#x27;ve said &#x27;ain&#x27;t&#x27; on the air. Because I sometimes use &#x27;ain&#x27;t&#x27; when I&#x27;m talking.&quot;

As a result of his unique style, Scott and ESPN received a lot of hate mail from people who resented his color, his hip-hop style, or his generation. In a 2003 &quot;USA Today&quot; survey, Scott finished first in the question of which anchor should be voted off &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, but he also was second to Dan Patrick in the &#x27;definitely keep him&#x27; voting. Jason Whitlock criticized Scott&#x27;s use of Jay-Z&#x27;s alternate nickname, &quot;Jigga&quot;, at halftime of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; as ridiculous and offensive. Scott never changed his style and ESPN stuck with him.

===Catchphrases===
Scott became well known for his use of catch phrases, following in the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; tradition begun by Dan Patrick and Keith Olbermann. He popularized the phrase &quot;booyah&quot;, which spread from sports into mainstream culture. Some of the catchphrases included:
* &quot;Boo-yah!&quot;
* &quot;Hallah&quot;
* &quot;As cool as the other side of the pillow&quot;
* &quot;He must be the bus driver cuz he was takin&#x27; him to school.&quot;
* &quot;He must be jelly cause jam don&#x27;t shake like that!&quot;
* &quot;Holla at a playa when you see him in the street!&quot;
* &quot;Just call him butter &#x27;cause he&#x27;s on a roll&quot;
* &quot;They call him the Windex Man &#x27;cause he&#x27;s always cleaning the glass&quot;
* &quot;You ain&#x27;t gotta go home, but you gotta get the heck outta here.&quot;
* &quot;He treats him like a dog. Sit. Stay.&quot;
* &quot;And the Lord said you got to rise up!&quot;
* &quot;Make all the kinfolk proud ... Pookie, Ray Ray and Moesha&quot;
* &quot;It&#x27;s your world, kid ... The rest of us are still paying rent&quot;
* &quot;Can I get a witness from the congregation?&quot;
* &quot;Doing it, doing it, doing it well&quot;
* &quot;See ... What had happened was&quot;

===Legacy===
ESPN president John Skipper said Scott&#x27;s flair and style, which he used to talk about the athletes he was covering, &quot;changed everything.&quot; Fellow ESPN Anchor, Stan Verrett, said he was a trailblazer: &quot;not only because he was black – obviously black – but because of his style, his demeanor, his presentation. He did not shy away from the fact that he was a black man, and that allowed the rest of us who came along to just be ourselves.&quot; He became a role model for African-American sports journalists.

==Personal life==
Scott was married to Kimberly Scott from 1993 to 2007. They had two daughters together, Taelor and Sydni. Scott lived in Avon, Connecticut. At the time of his death, Scott was in a relationship with Kristin Spodobalski. During his Jimmy V Award speech, he told his teenage daughters: &quot;Taelor and Sydni, I love you guys more than I will ever be able to express. You two are my heartbeat. I am standing on this stage here tonight because of you.&quot; His daughter, Sydni Scott, was named a Rhodes Scholar in 2022.

===Eye injury===
Scott was injured when he was hit in the face by a football thrown during a New York Jets mini-camp on April 3, 2002, while filming a special for ESPN, a blow that damaged his cornea. He received surgery but afterwards suffered from ptosis, or drooping of the eyelid.

===Appendectomy and cancer===
After leaving Connecticut on a Sunday morning in 2007 for &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; in Pittsburgh, Scott had a stomach ache. After the stomach ache worsened, he went to the hospital instead of the game and later had his appendix removed. After testing the appendix, doctors learned that he had cancer. Two days later, he had surgery in New York that removed part of his colon and some of his lymph nodes near the appendix. After the surgery, they recommended preventive chemotherapy. By December, Scott—while undergoing chemotherapy—hosted Friday night ESPN NBA coverage and led the coverage of ABC&#x27;s NBA Christmas Day studio show. Scott worked out while undergoing chemotherapy. Scott said of his experience with cancer at the time: &quot;One of the coolest things about having cancer, and I know that sounds like an oxymoron, is meeting other people who&#x27;ve had to fight it. You have a bond. It&#x27;s like a fraternity or sorority.&quot; When Scott returned to work and people knew of his cancer diagnosis, the well-wishers felt overbearing for him as he just wanted to talk about sports, not cancer.

The cancer returned in 2011, but it eventually went back into remission. He was again diagnosed with cancer on January 14, 2013. After chemotherapy, Scott would do mixed martial arts and/or a P90X workout regimen. By 2014, he had undergone 58 infusions of chemotherapy and switched to chemotherapy pills. Scott also underwent radiation and multiple surgeries as a part of his cancer treatment. Scott never wanted to know what stage of cancer he was in.

===Jimmy V Award===
On July 16, 2014, Scott was honored at the ESPY Awards, with the Jimmy V Award for his ongoing battle against cancer, which was his final public appearance before his death. He shared that he had had four surgeries in the week prior to his appearance, when he was suffering from liver complications and kidney failure. Scott told the audience, &quot;When you die, it does not mean that you lose to cancer. You beat cancer by how you live, why you live, and in the manner in which you live.&quot; At the ESPYs, a video was also shown that included scenes of Scott from a clinic room at Johns Hopkins Hospital and other scenes from Scott&#x27;s life fighting cancer. Scott ended the speech by calling his daughter up to the stage for a hug, &quot;because I need one,&quot; and telling the audience to &quot;have a great rest of your night, have a great rest of your life.&quot;

==Death==
On the morning of January 4, 2015, Scott died of appendiceal cancer in his home in Avon, Connecticut, at age 49. Soon after, his foundation for cancer research was created.

===Tributes===
ESPN announced: &quot;Stuart Scott, a dedicated family man and one of ESPN&#x27;s signature &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors, has died after a courageous and inspiring battle with cancer. He was 49.&quot; ESPN released a video obituary of Scott. &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called ESPN&#x27;s video obituary a beautiful and moving tribute to a man who died &quot;at the too-damn-young age of 49.&quot; Barack Obama paid tribute to Scott, saying:

A number of National Basketball Association athletes—current and former—paid tribute to Scott, including Stephen Curry, Carmelo Anthony, Kobe Bryant, Steve Nash, Jason Collins, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, Magic Johnson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James, Michael Jordan, Bruce Bowen, Dennis Rodman, James Worthy and others. A number of golfers paid tribute to Scott: Tiger Woods, Gary Player, David Duval, Lee Westwood, Blair O&#x27;Neal, Jane Park and others. Other athletes paid tribute including Robert Griffin III, Russell Wilson, Jon Lester, Lance Armstrong, Barry Sanders, J. J. Watt, David Ortiz and Sheryl Swoopes. UNC basketball coach Roy Williams called him a &quot;hero.&quot; Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians said: &quot;We lost a football game but we lost more this morning. I think one of the best members of the media I&#x27;ve ever dealt with, Stuart Scott, passed away.&quot;

Colleagues Hannah Storm and Rich Eisen gave on-air remembrances of Scott on &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and NFL Network respectively. Also on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, Scott Van Pelt and Steve Levy said farewell to Scott and left a chair empty in his honor. Tom Jackson, Cris Carter, Chris Berman, Mike Ditka and Keyshawn Johnson from &quot;NFL Countdown&quot; shared their memories of Scott.

During Ernie Johnson, Jr.&#x27;s acceptance speech for his 2015 Sports Emmy Award for Best Studio Host, the TNT and TBS NBA and MLB host gave his award to Scott&#x27;s daughters, saying it &quot;belongs with Stuart Scott&quot;. At the 67th Primetime Emmy Awards and at the 2015 ESPY Awards, Scott was included in the &quot;in memoriam&quot; segment, a rare honor for a sports broadcaster.

On Fox Sports Live on FS1, the broadcast team of Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, Erin Andrews and Chris Myers paid tribute to Stuart Scott from Fox&#x27;s gamesite. The &quot;Fox NFL Sunday&quot; crew anchored by Curt Menefee, Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, Michael Strahan and Jimmy Johnson also paid tribute to Stuart Scott on behalf of Fox Sports, as did Jay Onrait and Dan O&#x27;Toole from TSN in Canada.

===Funeral===
Scott was laid to rest in Raleigh Memorial Park on January 10, 2015, after a private funeral service at Providence Baptist Church. The public funeral visitation was held the previous evening.

<text>Greek tragedy () is one of the three principal theatrical genres from Ancient Greece and Greek-inhabited Anatolia, along with comedy and the satyr play. It reached its most significant form in Athens in the 5th century BC, the works of which are sometimes called Attic tragedy.

Greek tragedy is widely believed to be an extension of the ancient rites carried out in honor of Dionysus, the god of wine and theatre, and it heavily influenced the theatre of Ancient Rome and the Renaissance. Tragic plots were most often based upon myths from the oral traditions of archaic epics. In tragic theatre, however, these narratives were presented by actors. The most acclaimed Greek tragedians are Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. These tragedians often explored many themes of human nature, mainly as a way of connecting with the audience but also as way of bringing the audience into the play.

== Etymology ==

=== Aristotelian hypothesis ===
The origin of the word &quot;tragedy&quot; has been a matter of discussion from ancient times. The primary source of knowledge on the question is the &quot;Poetics&quot; of Aristotle. Aristotle was able to gather first-hand documentation from theater performance in Attica, which is inaccessible to scholars today. His work is therefore invaluable for the study of ancient tragedy, even if his testimony is open to doubt on some points.

According to Aristotle, tragedy evolved from the satyr dithyramb, an Ancient Greek hymn, which was sung along with dancing in honor of Dionysus. The term , derived from &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;song&quot;, means &quot;song of the goats,&quot; referring to the chorus of satyrs. Others suggest that the term came into being when the legendary Thespis (the root for the English word &quot;thespian&quot;) competed in the first tragic competition for the prize of a goat (hence tragedy).

=== Alexandrian hypothesis ===
Alexandrian grammarians understood the term as a &quot;song for the sacrifice of the goat&quot; or &quot;song for the goat&quot;, believing the animal was a prize in a race, as attested by Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;: 

=== Other hypotheses ===

There are other suggested etymologies for the word &quot;tragedy&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; adds to the standard reference to &quot;goat song&quot;, that:As to the reason of the name, many theories have been offered, some even disputing the connection with ‘goat’.

J. Winkler proposed that &quot;tragedy&quot; could be derived from the rare word &quot;tragizein&quot; (), which refers to &quot;adolescent voice-change&quot; referring to the original singers as &quot;representative of those undergoing social puberty&quot;.
 D&#x27;Amico, on the other hand, suggests that &quot;tragoidía&quot; does not mean simply &quot;song of the goats&quot;, but the characters that made up the satyr chorus of the first Dionysian rites.

Other hypotheses have included an etymology that would define the tragedy as an ode to beer. Jane Ellen Harrison pointed out that Dionysus, god of wine (a drink of the wealthy classes) was actually preceded by Dionysus, god of beer (a drink of the working classes). Athenian beer was obtained from the fermentation of barley, which is &quot;tragos&quot; in Greek. Thus, it is likely that the term was originally meant to be &quot;odes to spelt,&quot; and later on, it was extended to other meanings of the same name. She writes: 
&quot;Tragedy I believe to be not the &#x27;goat-song&#x27;, but the &#x27;harvest-song&#x27; of the cereal 
&quot;tragos&quot;, the form of spelt known as &#x27;the goat&#x27;.&quot; 
== Evolution ==

=== Origin ===
The origin of Greek tragedy is one of the unsolved problems of classical scholarship. Ruth Scodel notes that, due to lack of evidence and doubtful reliability of sources, we know nearly nothing about tragedy&#x27;s origin. Still, R.P. Winnington-Ingram points out that we can easily trace various influences from other genres. The stories that tragedy deals with stem from epic and lyric poetry, its meter—the iambic trimeter—owed much to the political rhetoric of Solon, and the choral songs&#x27; dialect, meter and vocabulary seem to originate in choral lyric. How these have come to be associated with one another remains a mystery however.

Speculating on the problem, Scodel writes that: 
Three innovations must have taken place for tragedy as we know it to exist. First, somebody created a new kind of performance by combining a speaker with a chorus and putting both speaker and chorus in disguise as characters in a story from legend or history. Second, this performance was made part of the City Dionysia at Athens. Third, regulations defined how it was to be managed and paid for. It is theoretically possible that all these were simultaneous, but it is not likely.

=== From dithyramb to drama ===
Aristotle writes in the &quot;Poetics&quot; that, in the beginning, tragedy was an improvisation &quot;by those who led off the dithyramb&quot;, which was a hymn in honor of Dionysus. This was brief and burlesque in tone because it contained elements of the satyr play. Gradually, the language became more serious and the meter changed from trochaic tetrameter to the more prosaic iambic trimeter. In Herodotus&#x27;s &quot;Histories&quot; and later sources, the lyric poet Arion of Methymna is said to be the inventor of the dithyramb. The dithyramb was originally improvised, but later written down before performance. The Greek chorus of up to 50 men and boys danced and sang in a circle, probably accompanied by an aulos, relating to some event in the life of Dionysus.

Scholars have made a number of suggestions about the way the dithyramb changed into tragedy. 
&quot;Somebody, presumably Thespis, decided to combine spoken verse with choral song. ... As tragedy developed, the actors began to interact more with each other, and the role of the chorus became smaller.&quot; Scodell notes that:

The Greek word for “actor” is &quot;hypocrites&quot;, which means “answerer” or “interpreter,” but the word cannot tell us anything about tragedy’s origins, since we do not know when it came into use.
Also, Easterling says: There is .. much to be said for the view that &quot;hypokrites&quot; means &#x27;answerer&#x27;. He answers the questions of the chorus and so evokes their songs. He answers with a long speech about his own situation or, when he enters as messenger, with a narrative of disastrous events ... Naturally, the transformation of the leader into an actor entailed a dramatization of the
chorus.

=== The first tragedies ===
Tradition attributes Thespis as the first person to represent a character in a play. This took place in 534 BC during the Dionysia established by Peisistratus. Of his tragedies we know little except that the choir was still formed by Satyrs and that, according to Aristotle, he was the first to win a dramatic contest, and the first actor () who portrayed a character rather than speaking as himself. Moreover, Themistius, a writer of the 4th century AD, reports that Thespis invented the prologue as well as the spoken part (). Other playwrights of the time were Choerilus, author of probably one hundred and sixty tragedies (with thirteen victories), and Pratinas of Phlius, author of fifty works, of which thirty-two are satyr plays. We have little record of these works except their titles. At this time, satyr plays were presented alongside tragedies. Pratinas definitely competed with Aeschylus and worked from 499 BC.

Another playwright was Phrynichus. Aristophanes sings his praises in his plays: for example, &quot;The Wasps&quot; presents him as a radical democrat close to Themistocles. Besides introducing dialogues in iambic trimeter and including female characters for the first time, Phrynichus also introduced historical content to the genre of tragedy (e.g. in the &quot;Capture of Miletus&quot;). His first victory in a contest was in 510 BC. At this time, the organization of plays into trilogies began.

=== Aeschylus: the codification ===
Aeschylus was to establish the basic rules of tragic drama. He is credited with inventing the trilogy, a series of three tragedies that tell one long story, and introduced the second actor, making the dramatization of a conflict possible. Trilogies were performed in sequence over a full day, sunrise to sunset. At the end of the last play, a satyr play was staged to revive the spirits of the public, possibly depressed by the events of the tragedy.

In the work of Aeschylus, comparing the first tragedies with those of subsequent years, there is an evolution and enrichment of the proper elements of tragic drama: dialogue, contrasts, and theatrical effects. This is due to the competition in which the older Aeschylus was with other playwrights, especially the young Sophocles, who introduced a third actor, increased plot complexity and developed more human characters, with which the audience could identify.

Aeschylus was at least partially receptive to Sophocles&#x27; innovations, but remained faithful to a very strict morality and a very intense religiosity. So, for instance, in Aeschylus, Zeus always has the role of ethical thinking and action. Musically Aeschylus remains tied to the &quot;nomoi&quot;, rhythmic and melodic structures developed in the Archaic period.

=== The reforms of Sophocles ===
Plutarch, in the &quot;Life of Cimon&quot;, recounts the first triumph of the young talented Sophocles against the famous and hitherto unchallenged Aeschylus. This competition ended in an unusual manner, without the usual draw for the referees, and caused the voluntary exile of Aeschylus to Sicily. Many innovations were introduced by Sophocles, and earned him at least twenty triumphs. He introduced a third actor, increased the number of chorus members to fifteen; he also introduced scenery and the use of scenes.

Compared to Aeschylus, the chorus became less important in explaining the plot and there was a greater emphasis on character development and conflict. In &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot;, the chorus repeats &quot;not to be born is best.&quot; The events that overwhelm the lives of the heroes are in no way explained or justified, and in this we see the beginning of a painful reflection on the human condition, still current in the contemporary world.

=== The realism of Euripides ===
The peculiarities that distinguish Euripides&#x27; tragedies from those of the other two playwrights are the search for technical experimentation, and increased attention for feelings, as a mechanism to elaborate the unfolding of tragic events.

The experimentation carried out by Euripides in his tragedies can be observed mainly in three aspects that characterize his theater: he turned the prologue into a monologue informing the spectators of the story&#x27;s background, introduced the &quot;deus ex machina&quot; and gradually diminished the choir&#x27;s prominence from the dramatic point of view in favor of a monody sung by the characters.

Another novelty of Euripidean drama is represented by the realism with which the playwright portrays his characters&#x27; psychological dynamics. The hero described in his tragedies is no longer the resolute character as he appears in the works of Aeschylus and Sophocles, but often an insecure person, troubled by internal conflict.

He uses female protagonists of the plays, such as Andromache, Phaedra and Medea, to portray the tormented sensitivity and irrational impulses that collide with the world of reason.

== Structure ==
The structure of Greek tragedy is characterized by a set of conventions. The tragedy usually begins with a prologue, (from&quot; pro&quot; and&quot; logos&quot;, &quot;preliminary speech&quot;) in which one or more characters introduce the drama and explain the background of the ensuing story. The prologue is followed by the &quot;parodos (entry of the characters/group)&quot; (πάροδος), after which the story unfolds through three or more episodes (ἐπεισόδια, epeisodia). The episodes are interspersed by stasima (στάσιμoν, stasimon), choral interludes explaining or commenting on the situation developing in the play. In the episode, there is usually interaction between characters and the chorus. The tragedy ends with the &quot;exodus&quot; (ἔξοδος), concluding the story. Some plays do not adhere to this conventional structure. Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;The Persians&quot; and &quot;Seven Against Thebes&quot;, for example, have no prologue.

== Language ==
The Greek dialects used are the Attic dialect for the parts spoken or recited by individual characters, and a literary Doric dialect for the choral odes. For the metre, the spoken parts mainly use the iambic (iambic trimeter), described as the most natural by Aristotle, while the choral parts rely on a variety of meters. Anapaests were typically used as the chorus or a character moved on or off the stage, and lyric metres were used for the choral odes. These included Dactylo-epitrites and various Aeolic metres, sometimes interspersed with iambics. Dochmiacs often appear in passages of extreme emotion.

== Greek tragedy in dramatic theory ==

=== Mimesis and catharsis ===
As already mentioned, Aristotle wrote the first critical study of the tragedy: the &quot;Poetics&quot;. He uses the concepts of &quot;mimesis&quot; (, &quot;imitation&quot;), and &quot;catharsis&quot; or &quot;katharsis&quot; (, &quot;cleansing&quot;) to explain the function of tragedy. He writes: &quot;Tragedy is, therefore, an imitation (&quot;mimēsis&quot;) of a noble and complete action [...] which through compassion and fear produces purification of the passions.&quot; Whereas &quot;mimēsis&quot; implies an imitation of human affairs, &quot;catharsis&quot; means a certain emotional cleansing of the spectator. What exactly is meant by &quot;emotional cleansing&quot; (κάθαρσις των παθήματων) however, remains unclear throughout the work. Although many scholars have attempted to define this element vital to the understanding of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;, they remain divided on the subject.

Gregory, for instance, argues that there is &quot;a close relationship between tragic &quot;katharsis&quot; and the transformation of pity and fear [...] into essentially pleasurable emotions in the theater&quot;.
Katharsis, on this reading, will denote the overall ethical benefit that accrues from such an intense yet fulfillingly integrated experience. Exempt from the stresses that accompany pity and fear in social life, the audience of tragedy can allow these emotions an uninhibited flow that ... is satisfyingly attuned to its contemplation of the rich human significance of a well-plotted play. A &quot;katharsis&quot; of this kind is not reducible to either ‘‘purgation’’ or ‘‘purification.’’
Lear
promotes as &quot;the most sophisticated view of katharsis&quot;, the idea that it &quot;provides an education for the emotions.&quot; &quot;Tragedy ... provides us with the appropriate objects towards which to feel pity or fear.&quot;

=== The three unities ===
The three Aristotelian unities of drama are the unities of time, place and action. While Aristotle did emphasize the unity of action, the idea of three unities as hard rules of dramatic art appeared only much later, during the Renaissance. 

#&quot;Unity of action&quot;: a play should have one main action that it follows, with no or few subplots.
#&quot;Unity of place&quot;: a play should cover a single physical space and should not attempt to compress geography, nor should the stage represent more than one place.
#&quot;Unity of time&quot;: the action in a play should take place over no more than 24 hours.

Aristotle asserted that a play must be complete and whole, in other words, it must have unity, i.e. a beginning, a middle and an end. The philosopher also asserted that the action of epic poetry and tragedy differ in length, &quot;because in tragedy every effort is made for it to take place in one revolution of the sun, while the epic is unlimited in time.&quot;

These unities were considered key elements of the theatre until a few centuries ago, although they were not always observed (such as by authors like Shakespeare, Calderón de la Barca and Moliere).

=== Apollonian and Dionysian: the analysis of Nietzsche ===

Friedrich Nietzsche at the end of the 19th century highlighted the contrast between the two main elements of tragedy: firstly, the Dionysian (the passion that overwhelms the character) and the Apollonian (the purely pictorial imagery of the theatrical spectacle).

Contrasted with that is &quot;nemesis&quot;, the divine punishment that determines the fall or death of the character.

In ancient Greek culture, says Nietzsche, &quot;there is a conflict between the plastic arts, namely the Apollonian, and non-plastic art of music, the Dionysian.&quot; Both drives, so different from each other, go side by side, mostly in open discord and opposition, always provoking each other to new, stronger births, in order to perpetuate in themselves the struggle of opposites which is only apparently bridged over by the common word &#x27;art&#x27;; until, finally, by a wonderful act of Hellenic &#x27;will,&#x27; they seem to pair up and in this pairing, at last, produce Attic Tragedy, which is as much a Dionysian as an Apollonian artwork.

== As a mass phenomenon ==

Greek tragedy as we understand it today, was not merely a show, but rather a collective ritual of the &quot;polis&quot;. It took place in a sacred, consecrated space (the altar of the god stood at the center of the theatre).

A spectator of a Greek dramatic performance in the latter half of the fifth century B.C. would find himself seated in the &quot;theatron&quot;, or &quot;koilon&quot;, a semi-circular, curved bank of seats, resembling in some respects the closed end of a horseshoe stadium. ... Below him, in the best location in the theatre, is the throne of the priest of Dionysus who presides in a sense over the whole performance. The theatron is large-in fact, the one in Athens, in the Theatre of Dionysus, with its seats banked up on the south slope of the Acropolis, seated approximately 17,000 persons.

The spectator sees before him a level circular area called the &quot;orchestra&quot;,
which means literally the &quot;dancing place&quot;. ... In the centre of the orchestra stands an
altar. A part of the dramatic action will take place in the orchestra, as
well as the manoeuvres and dance figures performed by the Chorus as
they present their odes. To the right and left of the theatron are the
&quot;parodoi&quot;, which are used not only by the spectators for entering and
leaving the theatre, but also for the entrances and exits of actors and
the Chorus. Directly beyond the circular &quot;orchestra&quot; lies the &quot;skene&quot; or scene building. ... In most plays the skene represents the facade of a house, a palace, or a temple.
The skene normally had three doors which served as additional entrances and exits
for the actors. Immediately in front of the scene-building was a level
platform, in the fifth century B.C. in all probability only a single step
above the level of the orchestra. This was called the &quot;proskenion&quot; or &quot;logeion&quot; where much of the dramatic action of the plays takes place. Flanking the
proskenion were two projecting wings, the so-called &quot;paraskenia&quot;. It must
be remembered that the skene, since at first it was only a wooden structure,
was flexible in its form, and was probably modified frequently.
The theatre voiced ideas and problems from the democratic, political and cultural life of Athens. Tragedies can discuss or use the Greek mythical past as a metaphor for the deep problems of current Athenian society. In such plays, &quot;the poet alludes directly to fifth-century events or developments, but moves them back into the mythological past. In this category [can be placed] Aeschylus’ Persians and Oresteia.&quot;

In the case of Aeschylus&#x27; tragedy &quot;The Persians&quot;, it was performed in 472 BC in Athens, eight years after the battle of Salamis, when the war with Persia was still in progress. It tells the story of the Persian fleet&#x27;s defeat at Salamis and how the ghost of former Persian King Darius accuses his son Xerxes of &quot;hubris&quot; against the Greeks for waging war on them.

&quot;The possibility that a reflection of Athens is to be seen in Aeschylus’ Persian mirror could explain why the poet asks his audience to look at Salamis through Persian eyes and elicits great sympathy for the Persians, including Xerxes.&quot;

Other tragedies avoid references or allusions to 5th century BC events, but &quot;also draw the mythological past into the present.&quot; The bulk of the plays in this category are by Euripides. Strains of fifth-century Athenian rhetoric, sketches of political types, and reflections of Athens’ institutions and society lend plays of this category a distinctly fifth-century Athenian flavor. The emphasis in Euripides’ Orestes on political factions, for example, is directly relevant to the Athens of 408 BCE.

The performances of the tragedies took place in Athens on the occasion of the Great Dionysia, feasts in honor of Dionysus celebrated in the month of Elaphebolion, towards the end of March. It was organized by the State and the eponymous archon, who picked three of the richest citizens to pay for the drama&#x27;s expenses. In the Athenian democracy wealthy citizens were required to fund public services, a practice known as &quot;liturgy&quot;.

During the Dionysia a contest took place between three plays, chosen by the &quot;archon eponymous&quot;. This procedure might have been based on a provisional script, each of which had to submit a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a satyr play. Each tetralogy was recited in one day, so that the recitation of tragedies lasted three days. The fourth day was dedicated to the staging of five comedies. At the end of these three days a jury of ten people chosen by lot from the body of citizens chose the best choir, best actor and best author. At the end of the performances, the judges placed a tablet inscribed with the name of their choice inside an urn, after which five tablets were randomly selected. The person who received the highest number of votes won. The winning author, actor and choir were thus selected not purely by lot, but chance did play a part.

The passion of the Greeks for the tragedy was overwhelming: Athens, said the critics, spent more on theatre than on the fleet. When the cost for the shows became a sensitive subject, an admission fee was instated, alongside the so-called &quot;theorikon&quot;, a special fund to pay for festival&#x27;s expenses.

== The surviving tragedies ==
Of the many tragedies known to have been written, just 32 full-length texts by only three authors, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, survive. More than 300 are known from fragments.

=== Aeschylus ===
Seventy-nine titles of Aeschylus&#x27; works are known (out of about ninety works), both tragedies and satyr plays. Seven of these have survived, including the only complete trilogy which has come down from antiquity, the &quot;Oresteia&quot;, and some papyrus fragments:
* &quot; The Persians&quot; ( / ), 472 BC;
* &quot; Seven Against Thebes&quot; ( / ), 467 BC;
* &quot; Suppliants&quot; ( / ), probably 463 BC;
* The trilogy&quot; Oresteia&quot; ( / ), 458 BC, consisting of:
** &quot;Agamemnon&quot; ( / );
** &quot;Choephoroi&quot; ( / );
** &quot;Furies&quot; ( / );
* &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; ( / ) of uncertain date and considered spurious by some scholars.

=== Sophocles ===
According to Aristophanes of Byzantium, Sophocles wrote 130 plays, 17 of which are spurious; the Suda lexicon counted 123. Of all Sophocles&#x27;s tragedies, only seven remain intact:
* &quot;Ajax&quot; ( / ) around 445 BC;
* &quot;Antigone&quot; ( / ), 442 BC;
* &quot;Women of Trachis&quot; ( / ), date unknown;
* &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; ( / ) around 430 BC;
* &quot;Electra&quot; ( / ), date unknown;
* &quot;Philoctetes&quot; ( / ), 409 BC;
* &quot;Oedipus at Colonus&quot; ( / ), 406 BC.

Apart from the plays that have survived in their entirety, we also possess a large part of the satyr play or &quot;Trackers&quot;, which was found at the beginning of the 20th century on a papyrus containing three-quarters of this work.

=== Euripides ===
According to the Suda, Euripides wrote either 75 or 92 plays, of which survive eighteen tragedies and the only complete surviving satyr play, the &quot;Cyclops&quot;.

His extant works are:
* &quot;Alcestis&quot; ( / ), 438 BC;
* &quot;Medea&quot; ( / ), 431 BC;
* &quot;Heracleidae&quot; ( / ), c. 430 BC;
* &quot;Hippolytus&quot; ( / ), 428 BC;
* &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; ( / ), 415 BC;
* &quot;Andromache&quot; ( /), date unknown;
* &quot;Hecuba&quot; ( / ), 423 BC;
* &quot;Suppliants&quot; ( / ), 414 BC;
* &quot;Ion&quot; ( / );
* &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot; ( / );
* &quot;Electra&quot; ( / );
* &quot;Helen&quot; ( / ), 412 BC;
* &quot;Heracles&quot; ( / );
* &quot;The Phoenician Women&quot; ( / ) circa 408 BC;
* &quot;Orestes&quot; ( /), 408 BC;
* &quot;Iphigenia in Aulis&quot; ( / ), 410 BC;
* &quot;The Bacchae&quot; ( / ), 406 BC;
* &quot;Cyclops&quot; ( / ) (satyr);
* &quot;Rhesus&quot; ( / ) (possibly spurious).

== Fragmentary Greek tragedy ==

Although only 32 full-length plays survive, many further works are attested in fragments. Aeschylus, for example, produced at least 70 further works which exist only in fragments. 

== The demos in Greek tragedy ==
The role of the audience in a Greek tragedy is to become part of that theatrical illusion, to partake in the act as if they were part of it. &quot;The Demos in Greek Tragedy&quot;, frequently addresses the works of Euripides. The way he addresses the audience through his plays is usually implied and never made obvious, as that would not only break the narrative that is being constructed, it would also fail to subject the disbelief of the audience. The article notes how often the audience is incorporated as being representative of the expected demos, usually by having silent actors, or individuals who are part of the Tragedy, be seated with the audience, to ensure that the actor is engaging with the audience.

Through further exploration into the role of the chorus, the author looks at what impact that may have had from the perspective of the demos. The author notes that it was often the case for tragic choruses to be of one type of social position (in both age, gender, nationality, and class). With regard to gender distinctions, the author finds that despite the fact that female choruses existed within Greek plays in general, they, like other enslaved and foreign individuals, lacked the same kind of status as male Greeks. Those not considered citizens were not representative of the demos. The author gives an example of how a female chorus in Aeschylus&#x27; &quot;Seven against Thebes&quot;, is criticized for being bad for citizen morale.

The author further notes how male-based choruses were designated by name based on their &quot;factions within the citizenry&quot; (p. 66). For example, if the chorus were composed of boys from Argive, then one would refer to them as &quot;Argive boys&quot; (p. 66). However, a much clearer distinction is made with adult males, such as &quot;jury-service-loving old men (Wasps)&quot; (p. 66), which indicates that the chorus is composed entirely of older men who are part of a jury service, further indicating their role within the citizenry. The citizen chorus was not only distinguished by status but was also seen as a subset of the demos.

== Tragedy as performance ==

Greek tragedy can often become confusing when trying to assess it as a drama, a detailed event, a performance, or even as something conveying an underlying theme. An article by Mario Frendo, looks at the latter as a phenomenon of performance, a separation in the meaning of the play from what it is actually being conveyed, and not an attempt to approach Greek tragedy through context (e.g., conventions of performance, historical facts, etc.). Approaching antiquity from a contemporary outlook, especially with regard to the construction and form of the plays, hinders any understanding of classical Greek society. 

The origins of Greek tragedy were mostly based on song or speech rather than written script. In this way, Frendo states that Tragedy by its nature, was performative. Frendo furthers his argument by drawing on previous research into Greek tragedy. He elaborates on the musical, often sing-song nature of the plays, and looks at oral tradition as the backdrop to the construction of these plays (e.g., oral tradition may play a role in the processes that lead to the creation of Greek tragedy). Frendo draws on the notion that the experience of tragedy requires a theatrical performance and is in that sense, a separation of tragedy from literature. Further stating that it is essential to look at tragedy as pre-drama, that it does not fit with a more contemporary envisioning of &quot;drama&quot; as we would&#x27;ve seen under the Renaissance.

After dialogue based interactions were eventually brought into development, the percentage of scripts read by the chorus tended to decrease in regards to their involvement in the play. Therefore, the author concludes that this not only demonstrates the performative nature of Greek tragedy but also brings forth the possibility that dialogic based strategies may have been employed.

== &quot;Deus ex machina&quot; ==
An article by Thomas Duncan discusses the impact of dramatic technique on the influence of tragic plays and conveying important or essential outcomes, particularly through the use of &quot;deus ex machina&quot;. This is a technique in which an action is halted by the appearance of an unforeseen character or through the intervention of a god, that essentially brings about a conclusion to a play. One such example can be seen with Euripides&#x27; play, &quot;Hippolytus&quot;. In the play, Hippolytus is cursed with an untimely death by his father, Theseus, for the supposed rape and subsequent suicide of Queen Phaedra, his step-mother. However, Queen Phaedra commits suicide due to unwanted desire for Hippolytus (instigated by the goddess, Aphrodite) and thus, blames her death on Hippolytus.

Hippolytus&#x27; demise is brought forth by a god, Aphrodite, whose hatred of Hippolytus&#x27; and his unending devotion to Artemis stems from his subsequent disparagement or denial of Aphrodite. In other words, because Hippolytus chooses to devote himself to the goddess, Artemis, whose themai, or divine domain, is chastity, for some reason, he decides to then deny the existence of another goddesses divine domain, Aphrodite&#x27;s&#x27; themai, lust, the polar opposite to chastity. The play demonstrates how divine intervention sets in motion the main theme of the play, revenge, and how that leads to the downfall of a royal family. However, it is not until the end of the play, when Artemis intervenes to tell King Theseus that he has killed his son by cursing him, that he has fallen prey to the workings of Aphrodite.

Without this kind of divine intervention, Theseus would not have realized his mistakes and Hippolytus would not have been cursed. Without divine intervention, the events that transpired would not have been as effective in revealing certain truths to the audience if they were to have come from a fellow human. In this way, such a technique is essential to the mechanisms of Greek tragedy and the capabilities of the tragedian in conveying their play as more than just a story or detailed event.

== Character identification ==
Character identification can be seen in many of Aeschylus&#x27; plays, such as &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot;. In this play, Prometheus, the Titan god of forethought and the inventing fire, stole the inventing flame from Hephaestus and gave it to humanity. Thereby, bestowing upon humanity knowledge of the arts, angering the gods. The idea behind this Greek tragedy is that Prometheus is punished by Zeus not only for the crime of giving humanity divine knowledge but also for believing that by doing so, humanity would, in some way, praise Prometheus as a champion for justice and see Zeus as nothing more than a tyrant. Through this the author notes how Aeschylus&#x27; play relates to this notion of character identification, as it depicts a being who is not necessarily acting out of selfish intention but in many ways was willing to be punished for the betterment of Humanity.

== Gender and tragedy ==
Although all actors and choruses were male, female protagonists and choruses were common in tragedy (especially in Euripides). In general, tragedy played with gender dynamics, representing feminine men and masculine women. This was so common as to be a defining feature of the genre. However, the female characters of tragedy are deeply ambiguous, often incarnating disorder and destruction within the home and the city. Characters like Medea and Clytemnestra are bold and prone to speaking outside of the house, whereas the ideal Athenian woman was much more meek and private. Indeed, Aristophanes lampooned Euripides for his &#x27;misogynistic&#x27; portrayal of women in his &quot;Thesmophoriazusae&quot;, indicating that the bold women of tragedy were not necessarily seen as admirable.

<text>was a Japanese astronomer. Starting in 1937, Honda worked for Issei Yamamoto at the Zodiacal Light Observatory in Hiroshima.

He discovered twelve comets between 1940 and 1968, including the periodic comet 45P/Honda–Mrkos–Pajdušáková.

He discovered on FH Serpentis (Nova Serpentis 1970) on February 13, 1970 from Kurashiki, Japan.

He was the first to report the very bright V1500 Cygni (Nova Cygni 1975) at magnitude 3.0 on August 29, 1975; it peaked at 2.0, and many hundreds of independent discoveries were subsequently made by others.

The asteroid 3904 Honda is named after him, 8485 Satoru is named after his wife, and 11442 Seijin-Sanso is named after his astronomical observatory.

<text>is a Japanese astronomer. He specializes in the study of comets, in particular calculating their orbits and making predictions about when periodic comets will return for another perihelion approach. It is considerably more difficult to predict the orbits of comets than of other types of Solar System objects, since their orbits are susceptible not only to perturbations from the planets but also to non-gravitational forces due to the release of gaseous material in the form of a comet&#x27;s coma and tail.

He is affiliated with the Computing &amp; Minor Planet Sections (Center for Astrodynamics) of the Oriental Astronomical Association in Sumoto, Japan.

He publishes the &quot;Nakano Notes&quot; on comet observations and ephemerides.

In 2001 he won the Amateur Achievement Award of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. The asteroid 3431 Nakano is named after him, and asteroid 3983 Sakiko is named after his sister.

1026 Ingrid was reidentified in 1986 by Syuichi Nakano, ending its time as a lost asteroid. 3568 ASCII is another long-lost asteroid whose recovery was made by Nakano.

<doc id="631821" wikidata="Q1247932" url="?curid=631821" title="Ecclesiastical Latin">
<text>Ecclesiastical Latin, also called Church Latin or Liturgical Latin, is a form of Latin developed to discuss Christian thought in Late antiquity and used in Christian liturgy, theology, and church administration to the present day, especially in the Catholic Church. It includes words from Vulgar Latin and Classical Latin (as well as Greek and Hebrew) re-purposed with Christian meaning. It is less stylized and rigid in form than Classical Latin, sharing vocabulary, forms, and syntax, while at the same time incorporating informal elements which had always been with the language but which were excluded by the literary authors of Classical Latin.

Its pronunciation was partly standardized in the late 8th century during the Carolingian Renaissance as part of Charlemagne&#x27;s educational reforms, and this new letter-by-letter pronunciation, used in France and England, was adopted in Iberia and Italy a couple of centuries afterwards. As time passed, pronunciation diverged depending on the local vernacular language, giving rise to even highly divergent forms such as the traditional English pronunciation of Latin, which has now been largely abandoned for reading Latin texts. Within the Catholic Church and in certain Protestant churches, such as the Anglican Church, a pronunciation based on modern Italian phonology, known as Italianate Latin, has become common since the late 19th century.

Ecclesiastical Latin is the language of liturgical rites in the Latin Church, as well as the Western Rite of the Eastern Orthodox Church. It is occasionally used in Anglican Church and Lutheran Church liturgies as well. Today, ecclesiastical Latin is primarily used in official documents of the Catholic Church, in the Tridentine Mass, and it is still learned by clergy.

The Ecclesiastical Latin that is used in theological works, liturgical rites and dogmatic proclamations varies in style: syntactically simple in the Vulgate Bible, hieratic (very restrained) in the Roman Canon of the Mass, terse and technical in Thomas Aquinas&#x27;s , and Ciceronian (syntactically complex) in Pope John Paul II&#x27;s encyclical letter .

==Usage==
===Late antique usage===
The use of Latin in the Church started in the late fourth century with the split of the Roman Empire after Emperor Theodosius in 395. Before this split, Greek was the primary language of the Church (the New Testament was written in Greek and the Septuagint – a Greek translation of the Hebrew bible – was in widespread use among both Christians and Hellenized Jews) as well as the language of the eastern half of the Roman Empire. Following the split, early theologians like Jerome translated Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin, the dominant language of the Western Roman Empire. The loss of Greek in the Western half of the Roman Empire, and the loss of Latin in the Eastern half of the Roman Empire were not immediate, but changed the culture of language as well as the development of the Church. What especially differentiates Ecclesiastical Latin from Classical Latin is the consequences of its use as a language for translating, since it has borrowed and assimilated constructions and vocabulary from the &quot;koine&quot; Greek, while adapting the meanings of some Latin words to those of the &quot;koine&quot; Greek originals, which are sometimes themselves translations of Hebrew originals.

===Medieval usage===
At first there was no distinction between Latin and the actual Romance vernacular, the former being just the traditional written form of the latter. For instance, in ninth-century Spain was simply the correct way to spell , meaning &#x27;century&#x27;. The writer would not have actually read it aloud as any more than an English speaker today would pronounce ⟨knight⟩ as .

The spoken version of Ecclesiastical Latin was created later during the Carolingian Renaissance. The English scholar Alcuin, tasked by Charlemagne with improving the standards of Latin writing in France, prescribed a pronunciation based on a fairly literal interpretation of Latin spelling. For example, in a radical break from the traditional system, a word such as ⟨⟩ &#x27;orchard&#x27; now had to be read aloud precisely as it was spelled rather than (later spelled as Old French ). The Carolingian reforms soon brought the new Church Latin from France to other lands where Romance was spoken.

===Usage during the Reformation and in modern Protestant churches===
The use of Latin in the Western Church continued into the Early modern period. One of Martin Luther&#x27;s tenets during the Reformation was to have services and religious texts in the common tongue, rather than Latin, a language that at the time, many did not understand. Protestants refrained from using Latin in services, however Protestant clergy had to learn and understand Latin as it was the language of higher learning and theological thought until the 18th century. After the Reformation, in the Lutheran churches, Latin was retained as the language of the Mass for weekdays, although for the Sunday Sabbath, the Deutsche Messe was to be said. In Geneva, among the Reformed churches, &quot;persons called before the consistory to prove their faith answered by reciting the &quot;Paternoster&quot;, the &quot;Ave Maria&quot;, and the &quot;Credo&quot; in Latin.&quot; In the Anglican Church, the Book of Common Prayer was published in Latin, alongside English. John Wesley, the founder of the Methodist churches, &quot;used Latin text in doctrinal writings&quot;, as Martin Luther and John Calvin did in their era. In the training of Protestant clergy in Württemberg, as well as in the Rhineland, universities instructed divinity students in Latin and their examinations were conducted in this language. The University of Montauban, under Reformed auspices, required that seminarians complete two theses, with one being in Latin; thus Reformed ministers were &quot;Latinist by training&quot;, comparable to Catholic seminarians.

===Modern Catholic usage===
Ecclesiastical Latin continues to be the official language of the Catholic Church. The Second Vatican Council (1962–1965) decreed that the Mass would be translated into vernacular languages. The Church produces liturgical texts in Latin, which provide a single clear point of reference for translations into all other languages. The same holds for the texts of canon law. Pope Benedict XVI gave his unexpected resignation speech in Latin.

The Holy See has for some centuries usually drafted documents in a modern language, but the authoritative text, published in the &quot;Acta Apostolicae Sedis&quot;, is usually in Latin. Some texts may be published initially in a modern language and be later revised, according to a Latin version (or &quot;editio typica&quot;), after this Latin version is published. For example, the Catechism of the Catholic Church was drafted and published, in 1992, in French. The Latin text appeared five years later, in 1997, and the French text was corrected to match the Latin version, which is regarded as the official text. The Latin-language department of the Vatican Secretariat of State (formerly the &quot;Secretaria brevium ad principes et epistolarum latinarum&quot;) is charged with the preparation in Latin of papal and curial documents. Sometimes, the official text is published in a modern language, e.g., the well-known edict &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot; (1903) by Pope Pius X (in Italian) and &quot;Mit brennender Sorge&quot; (1937) by Pope Pius XI (in German).

==Comparison with Classical Latin==

There are not many differences between Classical Latin and Church Latin. One can understand Church Latin knowing the Latin of classical texts, as the main differences between the two are in pronunciation and spelling, as well as vocabulary.

In many countries, those who speak Latin for liturgical or other ecclesiastical purposes use the pronunciation that has become traditional in Rome by giving the letters the value they have in modern Italian but without distinguishing between open and close and. and coalesce with . and before , , , and are pronounced (English ) and (English ), respectively. before a vowel is generally pronounced (unless preceded by , or ). Such speakers pronounce consonantal (not written as ) as as in English, not as Classical . Like in Classical Latin, double consonants are pronounced with gemination.

The distinction in Classical Latin between long and short vowels is ignored, and instead of the &#x27;macron&#x27; or &#x27;apex&#x27;, lines to mark the long vowel, an acute accent is used for stress. The first syllable of two-syllable words is stressed; in longer words, an acute accent is placed over the stressed vowel: adorémus &#x27;let us adore&#x27;; Dómini &#x27;of the Lord&#x27;.

==Language materials==
The complete text of the Bible in Latin, the revised Vulgate, appears at Nova Vulgata – Bibliorum Sacrorum Editio. New Advent gives the entire Bible, in the Douay version, verse by verse, accompanied by the Vulgate Latin of each verse.

In 1976, the Latinitas Foundation (&quot;Opus Fundatum Latinitas&quot; in Latin) was established by Pope Paul VI to promote the study and use of Latin. Its headquarters are in Vatican City. The foundation publishes an eponymous quarterly in Latin. The foundation also published a 15,000-word Italian-Latin &quot;Lexicon Recentis Latinitatis&quot; (&quot;Dictionary of Recent Latin&quot;), which provides Latin coinages for modern concepts, such as a bicycle (&quot;birota&quot;), a cigarette (&quot;fistula nicotiana&quot;), a computer (&quot;instrumentum computatorium&quot;), a cowboy (&quot;armentarius&quot;), a motel (&quot;deversorium autocineticum&quot;), shampoo (&quot;capitilavium&quot;), a strike (&quot;operistitium&quot;), a terrorist (&quot;tromocrates&quot;), a trademark (&quot;ergasterii nota&quot;), an unemployed person (&quot;invite otiosus&quot;), a waltz (&quot;chorea Vindobonensis&quot;), and even a miniskirt (&quot;tunicula minima&quot;) and hot pants (&quot;brevissimae bracae femineae&quot;). Some 600 such terms extracted from the book appear on a page of the Vatican website. The Latinitas Foundation was superseded by the Pontifical Academy for Latin () in 2012.

==Current use==

Latin remains an oft-used language of the Holy See and the Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church. Until the 1960s and still later in Roman colleges like the Gregorian, Catholic priests studied theology using Latin textbooks and the language of instruction in many seminaries was also Latin, which was seen as the language of the Church Fathers. The use of Latin in pedagogy and in theological research, however, has since declined. Nevertheless, canon law requires for seminary formation to provide for a thorough training in Latin, though &quot;the use of Latin in seminaries and pontifical universities has now dwindled to the point of extinction.&quot; Latin was still spoken in recent international gatherings of Catholic leaders, such as the Second Vatican Council, and it is still used at conclaves to elect a new Pope. The Tenth Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in 2004 was the most recent to have a Latin-language group for discussions.

Although Latin is the traditional liturgical language of the Western (Latin) Church, the liturgical use of the vernacular has predominated since the liturgical reforms that followed the Second Vatican Council: liturgical law for the Latin Church states that Mass may be celebrated either in Latin or another language in which the liturgical texts, translated from Latin, have been legitimately approved. The permission granted for continued use of the Tridentine Mass in its 1962 form authorizes use of the vernacular language in proclaiming the Scripture readings after they are first read in Latin.

In historic Protestant churches, such as the Anglican Communion and Lutheran churches, Ecclesiastical Latin is occasionally employed in sung celebrations of the Mass.

<text>Edward Dentinger Hoch (February 22, 1930 – January 17, 2008) was an American writer of detective fiction. Although he wrote several novels, he was primarily known for his vast output of over 950 short stories. He was one of the few American fiction writers of his generation who supported himself financially through short story publication, rather than novels or screenplays.

==Early life and career==
Hoch (pronounced &quot;hoke&quot;) was born in Rochester, New York, the son of Alice Ann Hoch (née Dentinger) and Earl George Hoch, a banker who outlasted both the Wall Street Crash and subsequent Depression. Graduating from the Aquinas Institute of Rochester in 1947, Edward attended the University of Rochester for two years before dropping out in 1949. He enlisted in the Army the following year, serving as a military policeman at Fort Jay on Governor&#x27;s Island in New York Harbor. After his discharge in 1952, Hoch remained in New York City for another year, working at Pocket Books, Inc.. Returning to New Rochelle, he began working at Hutchins Advertising Company as a copy and public relations writer, in which capacity he remained for roughly 15 years, until transitioning to strictly fiction writing in 1968.

Hoch began writing in the 1950s; his first story appeared in 1955 in &quot;Famous Detective Stories&quot; and was followed by stories in &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot;. In January 1962, he began appearing in &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;. In December 1962, he kicked off his most successful collaboration, with the appearance of his first story in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;; in the years since &quot;EQMM&quot; has published over 450 of Hoch&#x27;s stories, roughly half of his total output. In May 1973, &quot;EQMM&quot; began publishing a new Hoch story in every monthly issue; as of May 2007, the author had gone an astonishing 34 years without missing a single issue.

Other magazines Hoch wrote for included &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Double-Action Detective&quot;,
&quot;Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Science Fiction Magazine&quot;, 
&quot;Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Magazine of Horror&quot; and &quot;Web Detective Stories&quot;.

Hoch was a master of the classic detective story, emphasizing mystery and deduction rather than suspense and fast action; &quot;EQMM&quot; has called him &quot;The King of the Classical Whodunit.&quot; His stories are regarded as very well written and are usually tightly plotted puzzles, with carefully and fairly presented clues, both physical and psychological. He was particularly partial to &quot;impossible crime&quot; tales, where to all appearances the crime (usually a murder) could not have been committed at all; he invented numerous variants on the locked room mystery popularized by John Dickson Carr and others. For instance, in &quot;The Second Problem of the Covered Bridge&quot;, a man is shot at close range while alone on a covered bridge, while crowds of witnesses watch both ends of the bridge. Hoch cited Graham Greene, John Dickson Carr, Ellery Queen and Jorge Luis Borges as influences on his fiction, and reportedly took great pride in the compliment Carr paid him in a review of the 1970 anthology, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Grand Slam: 25 Stories from Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot;.
Let prejudice speak. My concern is with who and how and seldom with why. Therefore, in one person&#x27;s opinion, the prize should go to the very first story, &quot;Murder Offstage,&quot; a short-short by Edward D. Hoch; Satan himself could be proud of its ingenuity.

Hoch also published magazine stories under the names &quot;Stephen Dentinger&quot;, &quot;R. L. Stevens&quot;, &quot;Pat McMahon&quot;, &quot;Anthony Circus&quot;, &quot;Irwin Booth&quot;, &quot;R. E. Porter&quot;, &quot;Mr. X&quot; and the House Name &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;. In many cases, he also had a story under his own name in the same magazine issue. Hoch also wrote a novel &quot;The Blue Movie Murders&quot; published as Ellery Queen, under the supervision and editing of Manfred Lee, half of the writing partnership known as Ellery Queen.

In the early 1980s, Hoch outlined three paperback original mystery novels with Otto Penzler which were then ghost-written by other authors. The novels were published without the detective&#x27;s solution and offered a $15,000 cash prize to the first reader to solve the mystery. 

In 2001, Hoch was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America, the first time a Grand Master was known primarily for short fiction rather than novels.

Hoch, a Catholic, died at home in Rochester of a heart attack, aged 77. His wife, née Patricia McMahon, was his only immediate survivor.

==Series stories==
The overwhelming majority of Hoch&#x27;s stories feature series characters. He has created at least a dozen different series of stories for &quot;EQMM&quot; alone. His Captain Leopold series reached over 100 stories.

===Nick Velvet===
Nick Velvet is a professional thief for hire, with a peculiar specialty: for a flat fee, he steals only objects of negligible apparent value. Since his first appearance in &quot;EQMM&quot; in September 1966, he has stolen such things as an old spiderweb (which he was then obliged to replace), a day-old newspaper, and a used teabag. His original fee for a theft was $20,000. In 1980 he raised it to $25,000 at the urging of his long-time girlfriend Gloria (who met Nick in 1965 when he was burgling her New York apartment); in the 21st century his fee has risen to $50,000. Unlike many fictional thieves, Nick usually works alone on his thefts—in fact, until 1979 Gloria believed that Nick worked for the U.S. government.

The Nick Velvet caper stories generally combine a near-impossible theft with the mystery of why someone would pay $20,000 to have an apparently valueless item stolen. Although Nick often appears as devoid of curiosity as his targets are of value, circumstances usually force him to identify his clients&#x27; true motives, making him as much of a detective as Hoch&#x27;s more conventional characters. Most of the Nick Velvet stories have a light and humorous tone reminiscent of Leslie Charteris&#x27; early stories of the Saint. The fundamental immorality of Nick&#x27;s chosen profession is frequently offset by the larger justice resulting from his detective work.

A Nick Velvet story, &quot;The Theft of the Circus Poster&quot; in May 1973, began Hoch&#x27;s unbroken string of monthly appearances in &quot;EQMM&quot;. Another story, &quot;The Theft of the Rusty Bookmark&quot; in January 1998 featured the real-life Mysterious Bookshop of New York City, and its real-life owner (and Edgar-winning publisher and editor), Otto Penzler. &quot;The Theft of Gloria&#x27;s Greatcoat&quot; (May 1998), which describes the first meeting of Nick and Gloria, is unusual in that it is told in the first person by Gloria; all of the other Nick Velvet stories (and indeed the majority of Hoch&#x27;s stories) are third-person narratives.

===Captain Leopold===
Captain Jules Leopold is a police detective, the head of the Violent Crimes Squad of the police department for the fictional city of Monroe, Connecticut, a city apparently modeled on Hoch&#x27;s own home town, Rochester, New York, in Monroe County, New York. Along with his colleagues Lieutenant Fletcher and Sergeant Connie Trent, he is one of Hoch&#x27;s most conventional characters. The Leopold stories are police procedurals on the surface, showing the interaction of the officers as they investigate crimes, but the crimes themselves are frequently unusual and reflect Hoch&#x27;s skill at plotting and placement of clues. The story outcomes usually depend on the deductive ability of Leopold and his comrades rather than on straightforward police work, and sometimes feature impossible crimes and locked rooms.

The Leopold stories best illustrate one of the attractions of Hoch&#x27;s series tales: The characters age and alter realistically with time. In the course of the series, Leopold has divorced, remarried, retired, returned to work, and retired a second time. Lieutenant Fletcher has been promoted to captain to replace him, and Connie Trent has been promoted to Lieutenant. In some of the recent stories, the focus is on Fletcher and Trent, with Leopold only acting as a respected adviser.

Leopold first appeared as a subsidiary character in a 1957 story. In &quot;The Theft of Leopold&#x27;s Badge&quot; in March 1991, Hoch brought Captain Leopold and Nick Velvet together in the same story.

&quot;EQMM&quot; has published the majority of the Leopold stories, but a number have appeared in &quot;AHMM&quot; as well. The Edgar-winning &quot;The Oblong Room&quot;, perhaps the most frequently reprinted Leopold story, was first published in &quot;The Saint Magazine&quot;.

===Dr. Sam Hawthorne===
Dr. Sam Hawthorne is a retired family practitioner who is also a specialist in impossible murders. His tales are told as reminiscences of his small-town medical practice in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Sam Hawthorne tries to live a quiet life in the fictional New England town of Northmont, but wherever he goes someone always seems to die in a most improbable way.

First appearing in 1974, the Dr. Sam Hawthorne stories are carefully researched historical pieces, rich with period details about Sam&#x27;s cars, medical practices of the times, politics, and clothing. The stories of this series are among Hoch&#x27;s most humane tales: Sam himself is a cheerful fellow and tells his tales with humor, but his first-person narratives give readers a close look at his distress at the murders he investigates and his sympathy for the survivors. Because most of the tales take place in a single small town, the series has a larger-than-usual cast of recurring minor characters.

Each Hawthorne story is a &quot;locked room mystery&quot;, where an impossible crime occurs, usually a murder.

The earlier tales of the series include one peculiar device: Each one ends with a hint about the next story&#x27;s central puzzle, and each one begins with a reference to the previous story&#x27;s hint. Such a device is sometimes inserted when stories are anthologized, to make them seem more like a continuous narrative, but it is very unusual in the initial publication of independent stories in a series.

In &quot;The Problem of Suicide Cottage&quot; (&quot;EQMM&quot;, July 2007), it is revealed old Sam is 80 years old, and has a daughter named Samantha. He is telling his stories in 1976, and was born in 1896.

===Rand===
Jeffery (sometimes Jeffrey) Rand is a code and cipher expert, formerly with the Department of Concealed Communications of British intelligence. The Rand stories take place in exotic locations around the world, and frequently feature secret messages or codes. After he left Concealed Communications, many of his stories involved his half-Egyptian, half-Scots wife, Lella Gaad, who Rand met in &quot;The Spy and The Nile Mermaid&quot;. Rand met another Hoch character, Michael Vlado, in &quot;The Spy and the Gypsy&quot;.

===Simon Ark===
Simon Ark was the protagonist of Hoch&#x27;s first published story and ultimately featured in more than 39 short stories, which Hoch first collected in 1984. Ark appears to be an ordinary man in his sixties, tall and stout, but in many of the stories Ark implies that he is actually over 2000 years old, a Coptic priest who travels the world looking for evil—specifically, Satan. It is said that he is cursed by God, that when Jesus carrying the cross wanted to rest, Ark refused him rest and in turn has never known rest himself, doomed to wander the globe forever (although at least one story suggests Ark was instead the author of a fraudulent gospel so pious that God was unable to punish him with hell or reward him with heaven, and so left him on the Earth instead). However the immortality element is not played up in any way and is just incidental.

The Simon Ark stories have supernatural occult themes, although the crimes in them are always found to have been committed by mundane means. In the introduction to his 1984 collection, Hoch left the matter of Simon Ark&#x27;s real nature a matter for the reader to ponder. The 1984 volume presents what Hoch deemed to be the nine best of the 39 stories that he devoted to Simon Ark; it concludes with a list of all 39 stories, giving details of their original publications. (There were 39 stories as of 1984. He wrote others subsequently.)

===Ben Snow===
Ben Snow features in a series of American Old West mysteries set around the start of the 20th century. Like the Dr. Sam Hawthorne series, these tales are carefully researched historical pieces, sometimes including real historical characters such as Butch Cassidy. He met another Hoch character, Sam Hawthorne, in &quot;The Problem of the Haunted Teepee&quot;.

The first Ben Snow series appeared in 1961 in &quot;The Saint Mystery Magazine&quot;; the series has since been continued in &quot;EQMM&quot;.

===Stanton and Ives===
Walt Stanton and Juliet Ives are two Princeton graduates turned international couriers that have appeared in newer stories, beginning with &quot;Courier and Ives&quot; in November 2002. The pair are often sent to pick up or retrieve an item, and end up picking up the mystery around it.

===Sir Gideon Parrot===
Sir Gideon Parrot (pronounced &quot;parroe&quot;) is Hoch&#x27;s humorous tribute to the detectives of the Golden Age of mystery fiction, particularly Agatha Christie&#x27;s Hercule Poirot and John Dickson Carr&#x27;s Dr. Gideon Fell. These stories are gentle parodies of classic mystery devices, the ones so overused they have become cliches.

===Michael Vlado===
Michael Vlado is the young king of a Romany (Gypsy) tribe in contemporary eastern Europe.

===Alexander Swift===
Alexander Swift, one of Hoch&#x27;s later creations, is an intelligence agent for General George Washington during the American Revolutionary War. The stories comprise more nearly a serial than a series, as Swift probes ever deeper into rumors that the fort of West Point, commanded by General Benedict Arnold, houses a traitor who will betray the fort to the British Army. In the last Swift story, &quot;Swift Among the Pirates&quot;, Swift travels to England, to discover Benedict Arnold is dead.

===Barney Hamet===
Barney Hamet is a mystery writer who stumbles into real mysteries when he attends mystery conventions. Hamet also featured in Hoch&#x27;s 1969 novel &quot;The Shattered Raven&quot;.

===Susan Holt===
Susan Holt is a minor executive, in charge of promotions for a department store chain.

===Interpol===
The Interpol stories are an apparently discontinued series from the 1970s and 1980s. Interpol officers Sebastian Blue and Laura Charme investigated cases of international crime in Europe.

===Al Darlan===
Al Darlan (originally Al &quot;Diamond&quot;; Hoch decided to change the character&#x27;s name after the earliest stories to avoid confusion with radio/TV detective &quot;Richard Diamond&quot;) is a private investigator whose appearances have been sparse. His last appearance was in the May 2008 issue of &quot;EQMM&quot;.

===David Piper===
David Piper, aka &quot;The Manhunter&quot;, is the head of the Department of Apprehension.

===Father David Noone===
Roman Catholic priest who worked in an inner city parish.

<doc id="631823" wikidata="Q457312" url="?curid=631823" title="Takao Kobayashi">
<text>is a Japanese amateur astronomer and an outstanding discoverer of minor planets who currently works at the Ōizumi Observatory. The asteroid 3500 Kobayashi is named after him.

== Career ==
Kobayashi has discovered more than 2000 asteroids using CCD technology, including the Amor asteroids 7358 Oze, , and about nine Trojan asteroids. He also discovered the periodic comet P/1997 B1 (Kobayashi), which he originally reported as an asteroid.

His asteroid discoveries of January 16, 1994 and December 31, 1994, have been named 8883 Miyazakihayao and 10160 Totoro by Kobayashi. The names reference anime filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki, and one of his creations, &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot;. The names were approved by the International Astronomical Union. Kobayashi is not to be confused with another Japanese astronomer, Toru Kobayashi, who co-discovered comet C/1975 N1 (Kobayashi-Berger-Milon).

=== P/1997 B1 Kobayashi ===
On January 30 and January 31, 1997, Kobayashi observed an object, P/1997 B1 Kobayashi, which was initially thought to be a minor planet and was reported to the IAU as such by Syuichi Nakano. Over the next few days, the object was observed to be in a cometary orbit. Warren B. Offutt later showed it to be a comet.

<text>Megaherz (German name meaning &quot;Mega-heart&quot;, a pun on the homophone &quot;megahertz&quot;) is a German Neue Deutsche Härte band formed in Eichenau in 1993.

Megaherz has gone through many changes in musical style since their founding. Their early works can be categorized as dark alternative metal, comparable to 1990s American bands such as Faith No More, whereas recent works are comparable to bands such as Oomph! and Rammstein. Their early albums all include at least one song based on a classic German fairy tale, including &quot;Hänschen klein&quot; (&quot;Little Hans&quot;) on &quot;Herzwerk&quot;, &quot;Rapunzel&quot; on &quot;Kopfschuss&quot;, &quot;Windkind&quot; (&quot;Wind Child&quot;) on &quot;Himmelfahrt&quot;, and &quot;I.M Rumpelstilzchen&quot; on &quot;Herzwerk II&quot;.

The band has had many changes in line-up since its formation in 1993. Guitarist Christian Bystron and bassist Wenz Weninger have been the band&#x27;s only consistent members since 1995. Since vocalist Alexander Wesselsky&#x27;s departure in 2003, no founding member has remained in the band.

==History==

===Formation and early success (1993–2002) ===
Megaherz began as a musical project of Alexx Wesselsky, Josef Kalleder, Marc Bredtmann, and Tobias Trinkl. In 1995, they released a self-published demo album titled &quot;Herzwerk&quot;.

Christian &quot;X-ti&quot; Bystron joined the band while they were touring for &quot;Herzwerk&quot;. After a few rehearsals, bassist Kalleder quit and was subsequently replaced by Wenz Weninger. Both Bredtmann and Trinkl left the band soon after. The now trio of Alexx, X-ti and Wenz released the first studio album &quot;Wer bist du?&quot; in 1997, with a completely different sound, inspired by Clawfinger and incorporating electronic and rap elements that would become a staple in future albums.

Noel Pix had helped with the keyboards and programming on &quot;Wer bist du?&quot;, but joined the band full time on keyboards for the second album, &quot;Kopfschuss&quot;, released in 1998. The single &quot;Freiflug&quot; was released in 1999 to further promote &quot;Kopfschuss&quot;; it became Megaherz&#x27;s most successful single to date, peaking at No. 7 on the Deutsche Alternative Charts.

&quot;Kopfschuss&quot; was followed by &quot;Himmelfahrt&quot; (2000) and became the band&#x27;s debut album on the Media Control Charts, peaking at No. 78. &quot;Herzwerk II&quot;, released in 2002, had similar success, also reaching No. 78 on the German charts. In October 2002, vocalist Wesselsky announced that he was leaving the band due to creative differences. He would finish the 2002 tour before officially leaving the band on 1 January 2003 and forming the group Eisbrecher with Noel Pix. Since Wesselsky&#x27;s departure, there are no remaining founding members left.

===The search for a lead singer (2003–2007)===
In April 2003, the remaining members announced the new singer, Mathias &quot;Jablonski&quot; Elsholz of the band Twelve After Elf. Elsholz was already familiar to the band&#x27;s fans, as his vocals had been briefly featured on the track &quot;Falsche Götter&quot; from the album &quot;Himmelfahrt&quot;. By June 2004, a new album was under way. A new song was soon released with a small Macromedia Flash animation, substantiating the rumors of a new singer. This song was later revealed to be &quot;Zeig&#x27; mir dein Gesicht&quot; from the album &quot;5&quot;, which was released on 6 December 2004.

On 23 September 2005, the rest of the tours for the year were cancelled, as Elsholz left in &quot;total surprise&quot; to the band. The reason was not given on the Megaherz homepage, but, in the Eisbrecher forums. Elsholz announced that he and his wife were expecting twins, and he wished to devote more time to his soon-to-be family. &quot;5&quot; was released in the US via Eclipse Records on 21 February 2006.

On 18 April 2007, it was confirmed on Megaherz&#x27;s official website that the band found a new singer and was working on their sixth record. It was also stated that the band would tour while recording their new album.

=== Lex Wohnhaas officially joins (2007–2010) ===
By 18 August 2007, the band&#x27;s new line-up was announced, and the website was re-launched. Lex Wohnhaas from the band Seelenbrand was announced as the new singer, and Jürgen &quot;Bam Bam&quot; Wiehler from the band Bonfire was replacing Jürgen Zink. Lex previously played for Megaherz during a concert in Moscow just after Elsholz left.

The new album, &quot;Heuchler&quot;, was released in July 2008. After its release, it reached position No. 31 on the German Album Charts. The band played at the Summer Breeze Open Air festival in August 2008 and continued touring in 2009, playing at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen festival in Leipzig, Germany.

A compilation album was released in early March 2009, titled &quot;Totgesagte leben länger&quot; (&quot;Those declared dead live longer&quot;, a line from &quot;Dein Herz schlägt&quot; from the album &quot;5&quot;).

The band released their first remix album, &quot;Loblieder&quot;, on 1 April 2010, featuring remixes by artists such as Die Krupps, Suicide Commando, Rotersand, Letzte Instanz, and Staubkind.

===&quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, &quot;Zombieland&quot; and &quot;Erdwärts&quot; (2010–2017)===

By 22 December 2010, Megaherz were back in the studio working on their seventh album. On 18 April 2011, they announced that Christoph Klinke from &#x27;From Constant Visions&#x27; was the band&#x27;s new rhythm guitarist, replacing Roland Vencelj.

Announced on their official website on 24 May 2011, Megaherz was scheduled to release their new album on 14 October 2011, but by 20 August, it was announced that the release date for the new album has been moved to early December. Afterwards, an announcement on the band&#x27;s website on 22 September 2011 stated: &quot;In coordination with our record company, GoldenCore Records/ZYX Music, we decided to postpone the release of our new album finally to January 20th, 2012&quot;. Megaherz would also mention that the new album will feature 11 songs, and that one of the new songs will become available for download in October 2011.

Megaherz went on tour with Subway to Sally and Letzte Instanz in December 2011 before embarking on their own national tour in early 2012 to promote the new album.

The first single, &quot;Jagdzeit&quot;, was released on 23 December 2011. The new album, &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;, was released on 20 January 2012, and hit the German Media Control Charts at No. 19. Megaherz played at Wacken Open Air festival on 2 August, as well as Mera Luna Festival on 11 August 2012.

Megaherz released their first concert DVD on 16 November 2012, titled &quot;Götterdämmerung: Wacken Live&quot;.

The song &quot;Gegen den Wind&quot; was released on 25 January 2013 as the second single to the band&#x27;s album &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;.

The band announced on their official website on 20 January 2014 that they were working on a new album. By the end of February, the band announced that they had signed with a new record company, Napalm Records. The new album, &quot;Zombieland&quot;, was released on 24 October 2014 and would chart in the Media Control Charts at No. 17.

Megaherz then went on a tour with Unheilig, as support for their &quot;Gipfelstürmer Open Air Tour&quot;, between June and September 2015.

Megaherz would then release a new EP titled &quot;Erdwärts&quot; on 4 December 2015, followed by a tour across Russia, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland between December 2015 and April 2016. The EP consists of four new songs and two re-recorded tracks (&quot;Jordan&quot; and &quot;Teufel&quot;), both songs previously released on the band&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Kopfschuss&quot;.

Megaherz once again went on tour with Unheilig between May and July 2016 as a supporting act during Unheilig&#x27;s &quot;Ein Letzte Mal Tournee&quot;. Though Megaherz did not play any support shows for Unheilig in August, Megaherz was one of four supporting acts for the tour finale at RheinEnergieStadion on 10 September 2016.

Megaherz then embarked on the second leg of the &quot;Erdwärts Club Tour&quot; between November 2016 and January 2017.

=== &quot;Tour in China&quot;, &quot;Komet&quot; and departure of Jürgen &quot;Bam Bam&quot; Wiehler (2017–2019) ===

On 9 January 2017, after the &quot;Erdwärts Tour&quot; finale, the band announced that they have entered the studio to record their next studio album.

The band went on a four-date tour in China for the very first time in the bands 20+ year career in May 2017 playing in four cities, including Beijing. Megaherz opened for Marilyn Manson on 22 July 2017 at Woodstage Open Air Festival in Dresden, Germany.

&quot;Komet&quot; was revealed as the title of the upcoming 10th album scheduled to be released in February 2018.

Longtime drummer Jürgen Wiehler left the band in February 2018; Tobias Derer, was later announced as his replacement. Derer&#x27;s run with the band was short lived, as he left in April 2018. The band officially announced his departure in July 2018 and welcomed Rolf Herring on board as the new drummer.

&quot;Komet&quot; would turn out to be Megaherz&#x27;s highest-charting album to date, reaching number 7 on the German charts.

=== &quot;In Teufels Namen&quot; (2019–present) ===

In August 2019, Megaherz announced that they have begun work on a new studio album, originally aimed for a release in 2020.

On August 14, 2021, Megaherz announced via Facebook that drummer Rolf Hering would be leaving that band and joining medieval metal band Feuerschwanz. On April 6, 2022, they revealed that Maxx Hertweck was the new drummer of the band.

On August 11, 2023, their eleventh studio album &quot;In Teufel&#x27;s Namen&quot; was released.

==Musical style==
Megaherz primarily plays a style of Neue Deutsche Härte, a subgenre of industrial metal, which incorporates elements of groove metal, techno, and German rock. Megaherz makes use of clean and deep male vocals, heavy riffs, samples, keyboard, and synthesizer effects. During the early days of the band, Megaherz played an alternative metal style in the vein of Faith No More. Their albums &quot;Wer bist du?&quot; and &quot;Kopfschuss&quot; took on a rap metal and funk metal style, which included slap bass riffs and rapping.

<doc id="631857" wikidata="Q201333" url="?curid=631857" title="Hail to the Chief">
<text>&quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; is a piece originally announcing arrival by boat at an island in a Scottish loch, but today it is best known as the personal anthem of the president of the United States, adapted by James Sanderson from an original Scottish Gaelic melody.

The song&#x27;s playing accompanies the appearance of the president of the United States at many public events; it is also played at inauguration ceremonies. For major official occasions, the United States Marine Band and other military ensembles are generally the performers, so directives of the United States Department of Defense have, since 1954, been the main basis for according it official status. It is preceded by four ruffles and flourishes when played for the president. The song is also played during a former President&#x27;s state funeral after the casket is removed from the hearse. As it originated in the 19th century, the song is in the public domain due to its age.

==History==
Verses from Walter Scott&#x27;s 1810 narrative poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, including &quot;The Boat Song&quot; (&quot;Hail to the Chief&quot;) with which clan oarsmen announce their arrival by birlinn with their chieftain Roderick Dhu at Ellen&#x27;s Isle in Loch Katrine, were set to music around 1812 by the songwriter James Sanderson (c. 1769 – c. 1841); a self-taught English violinist and the conductor of the Surrey Theatre, London, who wrote many songs for local theatrical productions during the 1790s and the early years of the 19th century:

Scott&#x27;s romance was quickly made into unauthorized romantic melodramas. In November 1810, Scott wrote to a friend that &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; was being made into a play by Martin and Reynolds in London and by a Mr. Siddons in Edinburgh. About the same time, Scott received a letter from a friend and army officer who ended his note with a copy of the music of the Boat Song, &quot;Hail to the Chief.&quot;

A version of &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot; debuted in New York May 8, 1812, and &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; was published in Philadelphia about the same time as &#x27;March and Chorus in the Dramatic Romance of the &quot;Lady of the Lake&quot;″. Many parodies appeared, an indication of great popularity.

Association with the president first occurred in 1815, when it was played to honor both George Washington and the end of the War of 1812 (under the name &quot;Wreaths for the Chieftain&quot;). On July 4, 1828, the U.S. Marine Band performed the song at a ceremony for the formal opening of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, which was attended by President John Quincy Adams. Andrew Jackson was the first living President to have the song used to honor his position in 1829, and it was played at Martin Van Buren&#x27;s inauguration in 1837. Julia Tyler, second wife of John Tyler, requested its use to announce the arrival of the president. Her successor as first lady, Sarah Childress Polk, encouraged its regular use in this manner after it was used at James Polk&#x27;s inauguration; William Seale says, &quot;Polk was not an impressive figure, so some announcement was necessary to avoid the embarrassment of his entering a crowded room unnoticed. At large affairs the band ... rolled the drums as they played the march ... and a way was cleared for the President.&quot;

During the American Civil War (1861–1865) the piece was also used to announce the arrival of Confederate President Jefferson Davis. On October 3, 1861, Davis visited with Generals P. G. T. Beauregard, Joseph Eggleston Johnston, and Gustavus Woodson Smith at Fairfax Court House (now Fairfax, Virginia) for a Council of War. While at Fairfax, President Davis also conducted a formal Review of the Troops, which numbered some 30,000. At the start of the review, the band of the 1st Virginia Infantry struck up &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; and concluded with &quot;Dixie&quot;.

President Chester A. Arthur did not like the song and asked John Philip Sousa to compose a new song, which was entitled &quot;Presidential Polonaise&quot;. After Arthur left office, the Marine Band resumed playing &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; for public appearances by the president.

In 1954, the Department of Defense made it the official tribute to the president. The 1969 hit anti-Vietnam war single, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;, by the American rock group Creedence Clearwater Revival, specifically named &quot;Hail to the Chief&quot; when referring to patriots and jingoists.

For a brief time during his presidency, Jimmy Carter banned the playing of the song. The decision proved to be extremely unpopular among the American public, however, and Carter later reversed himself. 

In his 1990 Broadway musical &quot;Assassins&quot;, composer Stephen Sondheim uses variations on &quot;Hail To The Chief&quot;, most notably in the opening of the show where he switched it from its &quot;traditional march beat into 3/4 time, a carnival waltz&quot; to emphasise &quot;its more sinister elements&quot;.

==Lyrics==

Lyrics that were written by Albert Gamse are set to James Sanderson&#x27;s music, but they are rarely sung.

The original lyrics, written by Sir Walter Scott, originally written for &quot;Boat Song&quot; in Canto Second of his poem &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot;, read:

<text>The NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given since the 1955–56 season to the best performing player of the regular season. Since the 2022–23 season, winners receive the [[Michael Jordan]] Trophy, named after the five-time MVP.

Prior to 2021, the winner received the Maurice Podoloff Trophy, which was named in honor of the first commissioner (then president) of the NBA, who served from 1946 until 1963. With the switch to the Michael Jordan Trophy, his name was moved to a new Maurice Podoloff Trophy given to the team with the best regular season record. Until the , the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the , the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada.

Each member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to fifth place selections. Each first-place vote is worth 10 points; each second-place vote is worth seven; each third-place vote is worth five, fourth-place is worth three and fifth-place is worth one. Starting from 2010, one ballot was cast by fans through online voting. The player with the highest point total wins the award. As of the , the current holder of the award is Nikola Jokić of the Denver Nuggets.

Every player who has won this award and deemed eligible for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame has been inducted. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won the award a record six times. He is also the only player to win the award despite his team not making the playoffs in the . Both Bill Russell and Michael Jordan won the award five times, while Wilt Chamberlain and LeBron James won the award four times. Russell and James are the only players to have won the award four times in five seasons. Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Nikola Jokić each won the award three times, while Bob Pettit, Karl Malone, Tim Duncan, Steve Nash, Stephen Curry and Giannis Antetokounmpo won it twice. Russell, Chamberlain, and Bird are the only players to win the award in three consecutive years. Only two rookies have won the award: Chamberlain () and Wes Unseld (1968–69). Seven players who won MVP (combining for eleven total awards) are considered &quot;international players&quot; by the NBA: Hakeem Olajuwon of Nigeria, Duncan of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Nash of Canada, Dirk Nowitzki of Germany, Antetokounmpo of Greece, Jokić of Serbia, and Embiid of Cameroon.

Stephen Curry (2015–16) is the only player to have won the award unanimously. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal (1999–2000) and LeBron James (2012–13) are the only two players to have fallen one vote shy of a unanimous selection, both receiving 120 of 121 votes. Since the , only three players have been named MVP for a season in which their team failed to win at least 50 regular season games—Moses Malone (twice, and ), Russell Westbrook () and Nikola Jokić ().

Effective with the 2023–24 season, when a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the league and its players&#x27; union took effect, players must appear in at least 65 games to be eligible for most regular-season awards and honors, including MVP. To receive credit for a game for purposes of award eligibility, a player must have been credited with at least 20 minutes played. However, two &quot;near misses&quot;, in which the player appeared for 15 to 19 minutes, can be included in the 65-game count. Protections also exist for players who suffer season-ending injuries, who are eligible with 62 credited games, and those affected by what the CBA calls &quot;bad faith circumstances&quot;.

<text>The Buffalo Braves were an American professional basketball team based in Buffalo, New York. The Braves competed in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. In 1978, owner John Y. Brown Jr. swapped franchises with then-Boston Celtics owner Irv Levin, who then moved the team to San Diego, where it was renamed the San Diego Clippers. The franchise relocated to Los Angeles in 1984, becoming the Los Angeles Clippers.

==History==

===Play begins===
The Braves were one of three NBA expansion teams that began to play in the 1970–71 season (the others being the Portland Trail Blazers and Cleveland Cavaliers). It was originally owned by Neuberger Loeb, a New York City investment firm that had few ties to Buffalo. However, a series of missteps resulted in the league taking control of the team before it even played a preseason game. By opening night, Paul Snyder, a then 33-year-old entrepreneur who had recently cashed in on the sale of his Freezer Queen business, had bought the franchise for $4 million. They played their home games at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium, sharing the arena with another new franchise, the National Hockey League (NHL)&#x27;s Buffalo Sabres, who also debuted in 1970, as well as local college basketball teams that had used the auditorium for decades prior. Because the Braves only had third choice of dates (behind the Sabres and Canisius College Golden Griffins) at the auditorium, from 1971 to 1975 the Braves were forced to play a total of 16 home games at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto; in addition to alleviating the auditorium&#x27;s scheduling issues, the Braves also played internationally in the hopes of expanding their fan base beyond Western New York and into the Greater Toronto Area (a similar strategy was employed by the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s Buffalo Bills from 2008 to 2013). The NBA had two previous teams in Upstate New York, the Rochester Royals and the Syracuse Nationals (who are now known as the Sacramento Kings and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively). As of 2022, the Braves are the last New York State-based NBA team to be based somewhere other than New York City, where the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets play.

===Initial hiring===
The team&#x27;s first head coach was Hall of Famer Dolph Schayes and the franchise&#x27;s first star players were Bob Kauffman and Don May, who were acquired in the 1970 NBA Expansion Draft. However, in the NBA Draft of 1970, Buffalo passed on hometown hero Calvin Murphy, a 5-foot-9 point guard from Niagara University, and picked Princeton graduate John Hummer as their first round draft pick. Murphy would eventually be inducted into the Hall of Fame. As is typical of first-year expansion teams, the Braves finished with a dismal record, 22–60, seven games ahead of the Cleveland Cavaliers, their expansion cousins, who finished at 15–67. Kauffman, who averaged 4.3 points per game the previous year with the Chicago Bulls, led Buffalo in scoring with 20.4 points per game and earned a spot on the 1971 NBA Eastern Conference All-Star team.

===Season-by-season summary===

====1971–72 season====
The Braves repeated their 22–60 record in the 1971–72 season, but made acquisitions that would prove to improve the team. Buffalo drafted center Elmore Smith from Kentucky State University and local favorite Randy Smith from Buffalo State College. Johnny McCarthy replaced Schayes one game into the season as the team&#x27;s head coach.

====1972–73 and 1973–74 seasons====

The team did slightly worse in the 1972–73 season, as it went 21–61 under new head coach Dr. Jack Ramsay. In a showcase of the futility of the &#x27;72-&#x27;73 Braves, during the team&#x27;s fifth game of the season on October 20, 1972, the team set an NBA record which still stands for most points in a single quarter with 58 in the fourth quarter against the Boston Celtics. However the Celtics were in the process of a blowout win and had already led the Braves 103–60 at the start of the quarter. They had inserted their substitutes to play the final quarter and the reduced quality of the opponents allowed for the comeback. The Braves outscored the Celtics 58-23 but still lost 126–118. The Braves&#x27; big move that season was drafting forward/center Bob McAdoo from North Carolina. The team finally made its first playoff appearance in 1974, in which they faced the Celtics and lost in six games. That season, McAdoo posted averages of 30.6 points and 15.1 rebounds; this is the last time any player has averaged at least 30 points and 15 rebounds in the same NBA season. Also, that season, the Braves rookie Ernie DiGregorio won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.

====1974–75 and 1975–76 seasons====

In 1974–75, McAdoo was awarded the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, averaging 34.5 points, 14.1 rebounds. and 2.12 blocks per game, while shooting 51.2% from the field and 80.5% from the free-throw line. The Braves made trips to the playoffs in both 1974–75 and 1975–76, the latter of which would be their last playoff berth playing in Buffalo.

====1976–77 season====
The Braves by this point were a modest success, both on the court and off; the team was drawing close to the league average in fans, had solid broadcasting ratings and was turning a consistent profit. Even so, by 1976 Snyder was facing severe pressure to sell the team and get it out of Buffalo. As a result of the Braves only getting the third choice of dates at the Aud, the entire NBA was unable to finalize a schedule and hammer out television contracts until the Sabres and Griffins finalized their schedules. The NBA considered this untenable, and gave Snyder five years to resolve the problem. In a 2016 interview with &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; as part of a retrospective on the Braves, Snyder laid particular blame on Canisius president Father James Demske for making it difficult to get good home dates at the Aud. Snyder recalled offering Demske $125,000 per game to give up some Saturday night dates to the Braves. However, Demske turned the offer down, believing that the Braves posed a threat to the Little Three rivalry in college basketball. When the five-year deadline expired without a resolution, Snyder found himself with two options–build a new arena or sell the team. Building a new arena wasn&#x27;t financially realistic at the time, leaving Snyder with no option but to sell the team. Had the dispute been resolved, the Braves would have likely been able to stay in Buffalo, especially since Canisius basketball went into what would be permanent decline in the early 1980s.

At the time, Snyder&#x27;s more public feuds were with the Sabres, whose owners, Northrup and Seymour Knox, represented Buffalo&#x27;s old money circuit while Snyder had &quot;nouveau riche&quot; status. Years later, Snyder attributed these feuds to his own inexperience with sports ownership and now speaks in more conciliatory tones regarding his hockey competition.

The June 15, 1976 issue of Buffalo&#x27;s &quot;Courier-Express&quot; blasted the headline &quot;Braves Go to Florida, Leaving &#x27;Hockey Town&#x27;&quot;. Snyder had a handshake deal to sell the team for $6.1 million to hotel owner Irving Cowan, who would move the Braves to the Hollywood Sportatorium outside of Miami. However, the city of Buffalo filed a $10 million damage suit to block the move. The sale eventually fell through and the Braves and the city signed a new 15-year Memorial Auditorium lease in July with a provision that the lease could be voided if the team did not sell 5,000 season tickets in any season. Later that summer, Snyder finally sold 50% of the franchise to businessman John Y. Brown Jr., who had previously owned the Kentucky Colonels of the American Basketball Association (ABA). Brown later acquired the remaining half from Snyder sometime in the 1976–77 season and resold that share to another businessman, Harry T. Mangurian Jr.

Brown and Mangurian proceeded to dismantle the Braves. Ramsay, unwilling to have his career hurt by the change in ownership, left for the Portland Trail Blazers, who would win the NBA championship in the upcoming 1976–77 season. A provision in the team sale agreement stipulated that if Brown sold the contract of any Braves player, then the money would go to Snyder and the purchase price would be reduced. This subsequently occurred when the Braves sent McAdoo to the New York Knicks for players and cash midway through the season. Before the first game of the season, the Braves also managed to acquire eventual Hall-of-Fame center Moses Malone from Portland. However, after just two games in which he played a total of six minutes, he too was traded; he was sent to Houston for two draft picks. He would finish the season in Houston averaging 13 points and 13 rebounds while only two years later winning his first of three MVP Awards. The Braves would go through four head coaches in the next two seasons: Tates Locke, Bob MacKinnon, Joe Mullaney (formerly coach of the Colonels) and Cotton Fitzsimmons.

====1977–78 season====
The team&#x27;s poor play in its final two years (30–52 in 1976–77 and 27–55 in 1977–78) and the overt attempts to break the lease on Memorial Auditorium drove attendance down below the threshold that would have been needed to break the lease. John Y. Brown met with Irv Levin, who then owned the Celtics, and negotiated a deal in which the owners would swap franchises, with Brown taking control of the Celtics and Levin getting the Braves. Levin was a California businessman, and wanted to own an NBA team in his native state. However, he knew the NBA would not even consider letting him move the Celtics. He was therefore very receptive to Brown&#x27;s offer. The deal was brokered by then NBA general counsel David Stern, who became the league&#x27;s commissioner in 1984. Following what would be the Braves&#x27; final season in Western New York, the NBA owners voted 21–1 to let the team move. As Levin wanted, he became owner of a team in San Diego after the 1977–78 season, which became the San Diego (now Los Angeles) Clippers. As part of the transaction, the teams traded most of the players on their rosters.

==Team colors==

For the franchise&#x27;s first season (1970–71) team colors were blue, red &amp; gold; home white uniforms featured lettering and striping in only red &amp; gold, with road uniforms being blue, also with red &amp; gold lettering and striping. In the second season, (1971–72) the team adopted the colors of the Baltimore Orioles. This was with the heavy influence of the local uniform supplier, James (Jim) Ludtka. Ludtka, was a former pro baseball player with the New York Yankees and was scouting for the Orioles organization. The new color scheme was white, orange and black, with the now familiar &quot;feather B&quot; logo featured on uniforms that had diagonal stripes across both jerseys and shorts (the predominant color on the road being orange). This scheme was kept one more season (1972–73) and, with the 1973–74 season, the team adopted another new color scheme of Columbia blue and white, with uniforms including black accents outlining the lettering and also striping on jerseys and shorts; they continued with these uniforms until the team was moved to California. (Despite the new color scheme, the logo – which no longer appeared on the uniforms – remained the black and orange &quot;feather B&quot;).

==Clippers acknowledgement and naming issues==
Since Steve Ballmer bought the team, the history of the Braves have been acknowledged through occasional throwback uniforms during Clipper games and Buffalo throwback merchandise being made available through team venues, though any explicit Native American references outside the city name, the Braves name itself, and &quot;feather B&quot; logo have been de-emphasized, with the original &quot;feather sunburst&quot; logo remaining unused. The team&#x27;s name, said at the time to be a tribute to the Seneca Nation of New York, came well before the controversy of Native American names in sports beginning in the 1990s came to light, and the Braves nickname has been said to have been a &quot;curse&quot; upon the franchise from the start. The Clippers refused to relinquish the Braves trademark in 2005 when an expansion American Basketball Association franchise wanted to use it, so that team instead became the Buffalo Rapids.

==Broadcasting==
For most of the team&#x27;s existence, WBEN (930 AM) was the radio home of the Buffalo Braves, with Van Miller on play-by-play. Miller also called play-by-play on the team&#x27;s telecasts over WBEN-TV (channel 4, now WIVB-TV), the local CBS television affiliate. Snyder claimed that the Braves broadcasts were drawing far higher ratings than the Sabres at the time and insisted that if he had managed to keep the Braves in Buffalo, the Sabres would have been the team eventually forced to move out of the city.

<text>The Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council () building, formerly known as the Langevin Block (, ), is an office building facing Parliament Hill in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. As the home of the Privy Council Office and Office of the Prime Minister, it is the working headquarters of the executive branch of the Canadian government.

The term Langevin Block was previously used as a metonym for the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office and the Privy Council Office. The building was named after Father of Confederation and cabinet minister Hector-Louis Langevin. Recognizing Langevin&#x27;s role in establishing the residential school system, associated with the abuse of Indigenous children and attempts to forcibly assimilate them, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the renaming of the building on June 21, 2017.

The building is a National Historic Site of Canada.

== Description ==
It is built of sandstone obtained from a New Brunswick quarry owned by Charles Elijah Fish. It occupies a prominent place on Ottawa&#x27;s Wellington Street, adjacent to the National War Memorial, Chateau Laurier, Government Conference Centre, Rideau Canal, National Arts Centre, High Commission of the United Kingdom in Ottawa, and the Sparks Street Mall. 

The structure is distinctive in Ottawa for its Second Empire Style design because most government buildings from the period were built in the Gothic Revival style. It was designed by the Chief Dominion Architect Thomas Fuller, who also designed the original Parliament Buildings. In 2000, it was named by the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada as one of the top 500 buildings produced in Canada during the last millennium. The building is connected by a bridge to an office building at 13 Metcalfe Street.

While the offices of senior Privy Council Office officials remain in the building, its use is now largely limited to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, in addition to his or her office in the Centre Block of the Parliament Buildings. The Prime Minister of Canada has two office rooms.

==History==
Started in 1883 and completed in 1889, the building was the first federal government office building constructed outside the Parliament Hill precinct. Originally named the Southwest Departmental Building during construction, its name from completion until 2017 came from Sir Hector-Louis Langevin, the Public Works Minister in the Cabinet of Sir John A. Macdonald.

The building was first used by the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Indian Affairs and the Post Office. It was used by the Department of Indian Affairs until 1965. The building was renovated between 1975 and 1977 and has been used since by the Prime Minister’s Office and the Privy Council.

In 1977, it was designated a National Historic Site. This was to recognize Fuller&#x27;s work, its example as a Department of Public Works architecture, and its Second Empire style.

In 2017, the Assembly of First Nations called for the building to be renamed, largely based on Langevin&#x27;s role in the creation of Canada&#x27;s controversial Indian residential schools system. On June 21, 2017 the building was renamed the Office of the Prime Minister and Privy Council.

<doc id="631907" wikidata="Q1245778" url="?curid=631907" title="Squalidae">
<text>Squalidae, more commonly known as dogfish, dog sharks, or spiny dogfish, are one of several families of sharks categorized under Squaliformes, making it the second largest order of sharks, numbering 119 species across 7 families. Having earned their name after a group of fishermen reportedly observed the species chasing down smaller fish in dog-like packs, dogfish have slender, streamlined bodies, usually more compact in comparison to other species, and a pointed snout. Dogfish likewise have two dorsal fins, each with smooth spines, but no anal fin, and their skin is generally rough to the touch. As the species reaches adulthood, males usually measure a maximum of , while females typically measure long. The species therefore exhibits female-dominant sexual dimorphism.

Dogfish sharks have slate-grey or grey-brown skin with white dots that becomes paler (almost white) around the belly region. These sharks are characterized by teeth in upper and lower jaws similar in size; a caudal peduncle with lateral keels; the upper precaudal pit usually is present; and the caudal fin is without a subterminal notch.

They are carnivorous, principally preying upon organisms smaller than themselves. Some of their prey include herring, mackerel, and capelin. In special cases, they may consume jellyfish and squid. Even at a young age, spiny dogfish pups may hunt fish two or three times their size. Unlike virtually all other shark species, dogfish sharks possess venom which coats their dorsal spines; this venom is mildly toxic to humans and would be harmful if the shark were to be mishandled. The livers and stomachs of the Squalidae contain the compound squalamine, which possesses the property of reduction of small blood vessel growth in humans. Dogfish sharks use their strong jaw and sharp teeth to consume their prey.

The spiny dogfish has broken several records in the areas of migration and gestation. This shark tends to be a highly migratory species: one shark was recorded as travelling after being tagged in Washington state, United States, and found again later in Japan. In addition to its long distance migration, the spiny shark holds the record for longest gestation period of any other vertebrate at 22–24 months. Females produce eggs and give birth to live young that measure to be . The mating cycle of Squalidae consists of multiple paternity, where multiple males can fertilize a single litter. This allows for increased genetic variation, which is essential for the conservation of the species, given their susceptibility to fishing. 

== Taxonomy ==
Dogfish are scientifically classified as the Squalidae family, categorized under the Squaliform order, which encompasses seven families in total, including Squalidae. The Squalidae family itself contains two separate genera: &quot;Cirrhigaleus&quot; and &quot;Squalus&quot;, numbering 37 species between the two. Some extinct genera such as †&quot;Protosqualus&quot; have been documented.

<text>Mrs. Wilkes&#x27; Dining Room is a casual restaurant in Savannah, Georgia, US which offers a menu of Southern US home cooking. Situated in a historic house dated to 1870, it is a popular dining spot in the city. The restaurant was owned and managed by Sema Wilkes for 59 years, from 1943 until her death in 2002 at age 95.

==History==
Mrs. Wilkes&#x27; Dining Room was previously the dining hall of the Wilkes House, a downtown boardinghouse. Today the restaurant is housed on the ground floor of the same historic house, built in 1870, at 107 West Jones Street. The restaurant was described by author William Schemmel as &quot;a treasure hidden away in a historic district town-house.&quot; Its longtime owner, Sema Wilkes, published several cookbooks. her family continued to run the restaurant, serving lunch on weekdays.

Mrs. Wilkes and her restaurant have been the subject of newspaper and magazine articles. Japanese chef Hoshinao Naguma was once apprenticed to the restaurant.

==Customs==
Mrs. Wilkes&#x27; is noted for its homestyle traditions, in which guests are escorted in shifts of ten into the dining room, where a variety of dishes are freshly laid on one of several long tables. There is no menu; dishes are selected by the restaurant and change daily. &quot;Travel Holiday&quot; in 1993 recalled that the &quot;tables were set with steaming bowls and platters of tasty Southern food&quot;.

The guests sit at the table and pass the dishes around to one another like a family. There are usually long queues waiting to get in.

==Notable guests==
* David Brinkley once broadcast directly from the restaurant
* President Obama ate at the restaurant with Mayor Otis Johnson and other guests in 2010, having baked beans, fried chicken, and sweet corn
* Robert Duvall, Kate Smith, and Gregory Peck ate at the restaurant
* The cast of &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot; ate at the restaurant in October 2014

<doc id="631930" wikidata="Q6151736" url="?curid=631930" title="Membrane transport">
<text>In cellular biology, membrane transport refers to the collection of mechanisms that regulate the passage of solutes such as ions and small molecules through biological membranes, which are lipid bilayers that contain proteins embedded in them. The regulation of passage through the membrane is due to selective membrane permeability – a characteristic of biological membranes which allows them to separate substances of distinct chemical nature. In other words, they can be permeable to certain substances but not to others.

The movements of most solutes through the membrane are mediated by membrane transport proteins which are specialized to varying degrees in the transport of specific molecules. As the diversity and physiology of the distinct cells is highly related to their capacities to attract different external elements, it is postulated that there is a group of specific transport proteins for each cell type and for every specific physiological stage. This differential expression is regulated through the differential transcription of the genes coding for these proteins and its translation, for instance, through genetic-molecular mechanisms, but also at the cell biology level: the production of these proteins can be activated by cellular signaling pathways, at the biochemical level, or even by being situated in cytoplasmic vesicles. The cell membrane regulates the transport of materials entering and exiting the cell.

Thermodynamically the flow of substances from one compartment to another can occur in the direction of a concentration or electrochemical gradient or against it. If the exchange of substances occurs in the direction of the gradient, that is, in the direction of decreasing potential, there is no requirement for an input of energy from outside the system; if, however, the transport is against the gradient, it will require the input of energy, metabolic energy in this case. 
For example, a classic chemical mechanism for separation that does not require the addition of external energy is dialysis. In this system a semipermeable membrane separates two solutions of different concentration of the same solute. If the membrane allows the passage of water but not the solute the water will move into the compartment with the greatest solute concentration in order to establish an equilibrium in which the energy of the system is at a minimum. This takes place because the water moves from a high solvent concentration to a low one (in terms of the solute, the opposite occurs) and because the water is moving along a gradient there is no need for an external input of energy.

The nature of biological membranes, especially that of its lipids, is amphiphilic, as they form bilayers that contain an internal hydrophobic layer and an external hydrophilic layer. This structure makes transport possible by simple or passive diffusion, which consists of the diffusion of substances through the membrane without expending metabolic energy and without the aid of transport proteins. If the transported substance has a net electrical charge, it will move not only in response to a concentration gradient, but also to an electrochemical gradient due to the membrane potential.
As few molecules are able to diffuse through a lipid membrane the majority of the transport processes involve transport proteins. These transmembrane proteins possess a large number of alpha helices immersed in the lipid matrix. In bacteria these proteins are present in the beta lamina form. This structure probably involves a conduit through hydrophilic protein environments that cause a disruption in the highly hydrophobic medium formed by the lipids. These proteins can be involved in transport in a number of ways: they act as pumps driven by ATP, that is, by metabolic energy, or as channels of facilitated diffusion.

== Thermodynamics ==
A physiological process can only take place if it complies with basic thermodynamic principles. Membrane transport obeys physical laws that define its capabilities and therefore its biological utility.
A general principle of thermodynamics that governs the transfer of substances through membranes and other surfaces is that the exchange of free energy, Δ&quot;G&quot;, for the transport of a mole of a substance of concentration C1 in a compartment to another compartment where it is present at C2 is:

:formula_1

When C2 is less than C1, Δ&quot;G&quot; is negative, and the process is thermodynamically favorable. As the energy is transferred from one compartment to another, except where other factors intervene, an equilibrium will be reached where C2=C1, and where Δ&quot;G&quot; = 0. However, there are three circumstances under which this equilibrium will not be reached, circumstances which are vital for the &quot;in vivo&quot; functioning of biological membranes:
*The macromolecules on one side of the membrane can bond preferentially to a certain component of the membrane or chemically modify it. In this way, although the concentration of the solute may actually be different on both sides of the membrane, the availability of the solute is reduced in one of the compartments to such an extent that, for practical purposes, no gradient exists to drive transport.
*A membrane electrical potential can exist which can influence ion distribution. For example, for the transport of ions from the exterior to the interior, it is possible that:
:formula_2
Where F is Faraday&#x27;s constant and Δ&quot;P&quot; the membrane potential in volts. If Δ&quot;P&quot; is negative and Z is positive, the contribution of the term &quot;ZFΔP&quot; to Δ&quot;G&quot; will be negative, that is, it will favor the transport of cations from the interior of the cell. So, if the potential difference is maintained, the equilibrium state Δ&quot;G&quot; = 0 will not correspond to an equimolar concentration of ions on both sides of the membrane. 
*If a process with a negative Δ&quot;G&quot; is coupled to the transport process then the global Δ&quot;G&quot; will be modified. This situation is common in active transport and is described thus:
:formula_3
Where Δ&quot;Gb&quot; corresponds to a favorable thermodynamic reaction, such as the hydrolysis of ATP, or the co-transport of a compound that is moved in the direction of its gradient.

== Transport types ==

=== Passive diffusion and active diffusion ===

As mentioned above, passive diffusion is a spontaneous phenomenon that increases the entropy of a system and decreases the free energy. The transport process is influenced by the characteristics of the transport substance and the nature of the bilayer. The diffusion velocity of a pure phospholipid membrane will depend on:
*concentration gradient,
*hydrophobicity,
*size,
*charge, if the molecule has a net charge.
*temperature

===Active and co-transport===

In active transport a solute is moved against a concentration or electrochemical gradient; in doing so the transport proteins involved consume metabolic energy, usually ATP. In primary active transport the hydrolysis of the energy provider (e.g. ATP) takes place directly in order to transport the solute in question, for instance, when the transport proteins are ATPase enzymes. Where the hydrolysis of the energy provider is indirect as is the case in secondary active transport, use is made of the energy stored in an electrochemical gradient. For example, in co-transport use is made of the gradients of certain solutes to transport a target compound against its gradient, causing the dissipation of the solute gradient. It may appear that, in this example, there is no energy use, but hydrolysis of the energy provider is required to establish the gradient of the solute transported along with the target compound. The gradient of the co-transported solute will be generated through the use of certain types of proteins called biochemical pumps.

The discovery of the existence of this type of transporter protein came from the study of the kinetics of cross-membrane molecule transport. For certain solutes it was noted that the transport velocity reached a plateau at a particular concentration above which there was no significant increase in uptake rate, indicating a log curve type response. This was interpreted as showing that transport was mediated by the formation of a substrate-transporter complex, which is conceptually the same as the enzyme-substrate complex of enzyme kinetics. Therefore, each transport protein has an affinity constant for a solute that is equal to the concentration of the solute when the transport velocity is half its maximum value. This is equivalent in the case of an enzyme to the Michaelis–Menten constant.

Some important features of active transport in addition to its ability to intervene even against a gradient, its kinetics and the use of ATP, are its high selectivity and ease of selective pharmacological inhibition

==== Secondary active transporter proteins ====

Secondary active transporter proteins move two molecules at the same time: one against a gradient and the other with its gradient. They are distinguished according to the directionality of the two molecules:

*antiporter (also called exchanger or counter-transporter): move a molecule against its gradient and at the same time displaces one or more ions along its gradient. The molecules move in opposite directions.
*symporter: move a molecule against its gradient while displacing one or more different ions along their gradient. The molecules move in the same direction.
Both can be referred to as co-transporters.

==== Pumps ====

A pump is a protein that hydrolyses ATP to transport a particular solute through a membrane, and in doing so, generating an electrochemical gradient membrane potential. This gradient is of interest as an indicator of the state of the cell through parameters such as the Nernst potential. In terms of membrane transport the gradient is of interest as it contributes to decreased system entropy in the co-transport of substances against their gradient.
One of the most important pumps in animal cells is the sodium potassium pump, that operates through the following mechanism:

#binding of three Na+ ions to their active sites on the pump which are bound to ATP.
#ATP is hydrolyzed leading to phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic side of the pump, this induces a structure change in the protein. The phosphorylation is caused by the transfer of the terminal group of ATP to a residue of aspartate in the transport protein and the subsequent release of ADP.
#the structure change in the pump exposes the Na+ to the exterior. The phosphorylated form of the pump has a low affinity for Na+ ions so they are released.
#once the Na+ ions are liberated, the pump binds two molecules of K+ to their respective bonding sites on the extracellular face of the transport protein. This causes the dephosphorylation of the pump, reverting it to its previous conformational state, transporting the K+ ions into the cell.
#The unphosphorylated form of the pump has a higher affinity for Na+ ions than K+ ions, so the two bound K+ ions are released into the cytosol. ATP binds, and the process starts again.

== Membrane selectivity ==
As the main characteristic of transport through a biological membrane is its selectivity and its subsequent behavior as a barrier for certain substances, the underlying physiology of the phenomenon has been studied extensively. Investigation into membrane selectivity have classically been divided into those relating to electrolytes and non-electrolytes.

=== Electrolyte selectivity ===

The ionic channels define an internal diameter that permits the passage of small ions that is related to various characteristics of the ions that could potentially be transported. As the size of the ion is related to its chemical species, it could be assumed &quot;a priori&quot; that a channel whose pore diameter was sufficient to allow the passage of one ion would also allow the transfer of others of smaller size, however, this does not occur in the majority of cases. There are two characteristics alongside size that are important in the determination of the selectivity of the membrane pores: the facility for dehydration and the interaction of the ion with the internal charges of the pore.
In order for an ion to pass through a pore it must dissociate itself from the water molecules that cover it in successive layers of solvation. The tendency to dehydrate, or the facility to do this, is related to the size of the ion: larger ions can do it more easily that the smaller ions, so that a pore with weak polar centres will preferentially allow passage of larger ions over the smaller ones.
When the interior of the channel is composed of polar groups from the side chains of the component amino acids, the interaction of a dehydrated ion with these centres can be more important than the facility for dehydration in conferring the specificity of the channel. For example, a channel made up of histidines and arginines, with positively charged groups, will selectively repel ions of the same polarity, but will facilitate the passage of negatively charged ions. Also, in this case, the smallest ions will be able to interact more closely due to the spatial arrangement of the molecule (stericity), which greatly increases the charge-charge interactions and therefore exaggerates the effect.

=== Non-electrolyte selectivity ===
Non-electrolytes, substances that generally are hydrophobic and lipophilic, usually pass through the membrane by dissolution in the lipid bilayer, and therefore, by passive diffusion. For those non-electrolytes whose transport through the membrane is mediated by a transport protein the ability to diffuse is, generally, dependent on the partition coefficient K. 
Partially charged non-electrolytes, that are more or less polar, such as ethanol, methanol or urea, are able to pass through the membrane through aqueous channels immersed in the membrane. There is no effective regulation mechanism that limits this transport, which indicates an intrinsic vulnerability of the cells to the penetration of these molecules.

==Creation of membrane transport proteins==
There are several databases which attempt to construct phylogenetic trees detailing the creation of transporter proteins. One such resource is the Transporter Classification database

<doc id="631934" wikidata="Q177304" url="?curid=631934" title="Applied anthropology">
<text>Applied anthropology is the practical application of anthropological theories, methods, and practices to the analysis and solution of practical problems. The term was first put forward by Daniel G. Brinton in his paper &quot;The Aims of Anthropology&quot;. John Van Willengen defined applied anthropology as &quot;anthropology put to use&quot;. Applied anthropology includes conducting research with a primary or tertiary purpose to solve real-world problems in areas such as public health, education, government, and business. 

In &quot;Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application&quot;, Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a &quot;complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy&quot;. In other words, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and activism within the participating community. 

==Spanning academic disciplines==
The American Anthropological Association (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on &quot;the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences.&quot; Thus, the field of anthropology encompasses four subareas: sociocultural anthropology, biological (or physical) anthropology, archaeology, and linguistic anthropology. Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an &quot;applied anthropologist&quot;. In fact, some practical, real-world problems invoke all sub-disciplines of anthropological theory, method, and practice. For example, a Native American community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, and medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases.

==Professional engagement==
Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as governments, development agencies, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), tribal and ethnic associations, advocacy groups, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.

Methodology utilized in applied anthropology includes, but is not limited to, ethnography, participant observation, snowballing, interviews, and focus groups. Applied anthropologists also use textual analysis, surveying, archival research, and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.

==Problems and criticisms==
The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to improve the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of Orientalism and/or colonialism. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: &quot;The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied.&quot; The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p. 16).

Although guidelines regarding ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural &quot;broker&quot;, evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst.

There has also been some criticism of the interaction between applied anthropologists and government agencies, as those agencies may want to move forward with a development project while anthropologists restrict progress studying carefully before supporting the project.

===Debates about objectivity/cultural relativity in anthropology ===

The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of objectivity in anthropological fieldwork. Some hermeneutic scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one&#x27;s own preconceived cultural notions from one&#x27;s work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the positivist approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.

The multinational phenomenon of female genital cutting (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: &quot;The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that &quot;do&quot; offer emic interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice&quot; [emphasis in original]. In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to &quot;remedy&quot; a complex social issue.

==Scholarly works and organizations==
There are three primary groups based in the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).

The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called &quot;Human Organization&quot;, published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called &quot;Anthropology in Action&quot;.

The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as &quot;Apply&quot;. Within the European Association of Social Anthropologists (EASA), there is the Applied Anthropology Network, which annually organises the international symposium, Why the World Needs Anthropologists. The theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), followed by; Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA Medical Anthropology Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.

Under the direction of the Royal Anthropological Institute, Jonathan Benthall (author of &quot;The Best of Anthropology Today&quot;) created the annual Lucy Mair Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology &quot;for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity&quot;.

<doc id="631961" wikidata="Q736072" url="?curid=631961" title="Taksim Square">
<text>Taksim Square (, ), situated in Beyoğlu in the European part of Istanbul, Turkey, is a major tourist and leisure district famed for its restaurants, shops, and hotels. It is considered the heart of modern Istanbul, with the central station of the Istanbul Metro network. Taksim Square is also the location of the Republic Monument () which was crafted by Pietro Canonica and inaugurated in 1928. The monument commemorates the 5th anniversary of the foundation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, following the Turkish War of Independence.

The square is flanked to the south by The Marmara Hotel, to the east by the Atatürk Cultural Centre, to the north by Gezi Park and to the west by Taksim Mosque. Several major roads converge on the square: Gümüşsuyu Caddesi, Cumhuriyet Caddesi, Tarlabaşı Bulvarı, İstiklal Caddesi and Sıraselviler Caddesi. 

==History==

The word Taksim means &quot;division&quot; or &quot;distribution&quot; in Arabic. Taksim Square was originally the point where the main water lines from the north of Istanbul were collected and branched off to other parts of the city (hence the name.) This use for the area was established by Sultan Mahmud I. The square takes its name from the Ottoman era stone reservoir which is located along one side of the square. 

Another significant building that once stood on the square was the 19th century Taksim Artillery Barracks (&quot;Taksim Kışlası&quot;, which later became the Taksim Stadium), but which was demolished in 1940 during the construction works in accordance with the plans of French architect and city planner Henri Prost for Taksim Square and Taksim Gezi Park. 

Taksim Gezi Park is a small green park in the midst of the concrete expanse of central Istanbul. In 2013, the city municipality, wanting to rebuild the old barracks as a shopping venue on the site of the park, began forcefully removing protesters who had set up camp in the park. After news spread of the police brutality, thousands of people rallied in the Occupy Taksim movement, to stop the demolition of the park. As of 2013, the status of the demolition project was in limbo, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government has the Police stationed in and around Taksim Square ready with riot control equipment to deter any large demonstrations.

==Present day==

Taksim is a main transportation hub and a popular destination for both tourists and residents of Istanbul. İstiklal Caddesi (Independence Avenue), a long pedestrian shopping street, ends at this square, and a nostalgic tram runs from the square along the avenue, ending near the Tünel (1875) which is the world&#x27;s second-oldest subway line after London&#x27;s Underground (1863). In addition to serving as the main transfer point for the municipal bus system, Taksim Square is also the terminus of the Hacıosman-4. Levent-Taksim-Yenikapı subway line of the Istanbul Metro.

Taksim&#x27;s position was given an extra boost on June 29, 2006, when the new Kabataş-Taksim Funicular line F1 connecting the Taksim Metro station with the Kabataş tramway station and Seabus port was opened, allowing people to ascend to Taksim in just 110 seconds.

Surrounding Taksim Square are numerous travel agencies, hotels, restaurants, pubs, and international fast food chains such as Pizza Hut, McDonald&#x27;s, Subway, and Burger King. It is also home to some of Istanbul&#x27;s grandest hotels including the InterContinental, the Divan, and The Marmara Hotel. Taksim used to be a favourite location for public events such as parades, New Year celebrations, and other social gatherings, although since 2016 permission has rarely been given for such gatherings. 

Atatürk Cultural Center (&quot;Atatürk Kültür Merkezi&quot;), a multi-purpose concert hall and cultural centre reopened after renovation in 2021, is also located in Taksim Square. It faces the Taksim Square Mosque which also opened 2021.

==Demonstrations and incidents==
The square used to be an important venue for political protests. 

* On February 16, 1969, some 150 leftist demonstrators were injured during clashes with right wing groups in what is known as &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;.
* In the events known as the Taksim Square massacre, 36 left-wing demonstrators were killed by unidentified and allegedly right-wing gunmen on the square during the Labour Day demonstrations of May 1, 1977.
* On 10 August 1982, Artin Penik, a Turkish Armenian, set himself on fire to protest the Esenboga airport attack by the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia.
* Taksim Square was the location of football riots in 2000 when two Leeds United fans were stabbed to death during clashes with Galatasaray fans, the night before the 1999-2000 UEFA Cup semi-final first leg match between the two teams.
* On October 31, 2010, a suicide bomb went off next to a police bus. The bomber, a TAK militant, died, while 15 police officers and 17 civilians were injured.

* A march to protest the Circassian genocide took place in May 2011.

Following many other violent incidents, all protests and demonstrations were banned and today police units maintain a round-the-clock presence to prevent any incidents. It is many years since either May Day or New Year&#x27;s Day events were permitted to take place in the square, with much of the surrounding area usually fenced off for the day and the Metro station often closed to prevent people gathering. 

===Gezi Park protests===


In 2013, protests took place in Taksim in opposition to the reconstruction of the Ottoman era Taksim Military Barracks (demolished in 1940 to create Gezi Park) and a shopping centre on the site of Gezi Park. In the early morning of May 31, police forces moved in on the demonstrators and people sleeping in tents, and tried to disperse them with tear gas, pepperspray and water cannons.

The demonstrators criticized Prime Minister (now President) Recep Tayyip Erdoğan for his uncompromising stance on this controversial issue and for the Turkish police&#x27;s excessive use of force against the demonstrators.

The large number of trees in the forests of northern Istanbul that were cut down to provide access to the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge (Third Bosphorus Bridge) and the new Istanbul International Airport (the world&#x27;s largest airport) were other factors that triggered the Gezi Park protests. According to official Turkish government data, a total of 2,330,012 trees have been cut down to make way for the airport and its road connections; while a further 381,096 trees were cut down to make way for the highways leading to the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge.

<doc id="631964" wikidata="Q644357" url="?curid=631964" title="NBA Rookie of the Year">
<text>The National Basketball Association&#x27;s Rookie of the Year is an annual National Basketball Association (NBA) award given to the top rookie(s) of the regular season. Initiated following the 1952–53 NBA season, it confers the Eddie Gottlieb Trophy, named after the former Philadelphia Warriors head coach. Since the 2022–23 NBA season, winners receive the [[Wilt Chamberlain]] Trophy, named after the former Rookie of the Year winner.

The winner is selected by a panel of United States and Canadian sportswriters and broadcasters, each casting first-, second-, and third-place votes (worth five points, three points, and one point, respectively). The player(s) with the highest point total, regardless of the number of first-place votes, wins the award.

The most recent Rookie of the Year winner is Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs. Twenty-two winners were drafted first overall. Sixteen winners have also won the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in their careers with Wilt Chamberlain and Wes Unseld earning both honors the same season. Thirty of the non-active winners have been elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. Three seasons had joint winners—Dave Cowens and Geoff Petrie in the , Grant Hill and Jason Kidd in the , and Elton Brand and Steve Francis in the 1999–2000 season. Six players won the award unanimously (by capturing all of the first-place votes)—Ralph Sampson, David Robinson, Blake Griffin, Damian Lillard, Karl-Anthony Towns, and Victor Wembanyama.

Patrick Ewing of Jamaica, Pau Gasol of Spain, Kyrie Irving and Ben Simmons of Australia, Andrew Wiggins of Canada, Luka Dončić of Slovenia, and Victor Wembanyama of France are the only winners not born in the United States. Three of these individuals have dual nationality by birth—Wiggins and Simmons have American fathers, and both of Irving&#x27;s parents are Americans. Ewing immigrated to the Boston area at age 11, Irving moved to the United States at age 2, and Wiggins and Simmons moved to the U.S. while in high school. Gasol, Dončić, and Wembanyama are the only winners trained entirely outside the United States.

Chamberlain (Harlem Globetrotters), Gasol (FC Barcelona of Liga ACB and EuroLeague), Dončić (Real Madrid of Liga ACB and EuroLeague), LaMelo Ball (BC Prienai of the Lithuanian Basketball League, the Los Angeles Ballers of the JBA, and the Illawarra Hawks of the NBL), and Wembanyama (Nanterre 92, ASVEL, and Metropolitans 92 of LNB Élite) all had professional careers outside the NBA prior to being drafted. Ball also had previously won the NBL Rookie of the Year Award.

== Winners ==





== Unofficial winners ==
Prior to the season, the Rookie of the Year was selected by newspaper writers; however, the NBA does not officially recognize those players as winners. The league published the pre-1953 winners in their 1994–95 edition of the &quot;Official NBA Guide&quot; and the 1994 &quot;Official NBA Basketball Encyclopedia&quot;, but those winners have not been listed in subsequent publications.

<text>Archaeogastropoda (also known as Aspidobranchia) was a taxonomic order of sea snails used in older classifications of gastropods, i.e. snails and slugs. Archeogastropoda are marine prosobranch gastropod mollusks, mainly herbivores, typically having two gills and a double-chambered heart, with the eggs and sperm discharged directly into the water. They were traditionally regarded as a relatively primitive group.

This older classification of the gastropods is based on the classification of Johannes Thiele (1925). This classification was not based on true phylogenetic relationships, but on more general affinities between the groups. In the last few years, two new cladistic taxonomies of the gastropods have been published (in 1997 and 2005). This has led to an extensive reclassification of gastropod taxa. The taxon Archaeogastropoda was found to be a paraphyletic group, and therefore unacceptable in a strictly cladistic classification.

In the 1997 classification, most of the former Archaeogastropoda were included in:
*subclass Eogastropoda
**order Patellogastropoda (limpets)
*subclass Orthogastropoda
**Superorder Vetigastropoda 
**Superorder Neritaemorphi (with the order Neritopsina ).

A more detailed classification can be found on Gastropoda.

<text>Mike Church (born 1962) is an American radio and internet talk show host and singer/songwriter. 

&quot;The Mike Church Show&quot; was the first-ever produced talk show on Sirius Satellite Radio (now Sirius XM Radio). Prior to its cancellation in October 2015, Church&#x27;s show was the longest-running program on satellite radio. His final live show on Sirius XM aired on the morning of Tuesday, October 27, 2015. In 2011 Michael Dougherty, writing for &quot;The American Conservative&quot;, called Church &quot;the most radical man on the radio&quot;. 

Church also created original conservative-themed parody songs, which include &quot;Manuel Went Down To Georgia,&quot; &quot;There&#x27;s Democrats Somewhere&quot;; &quot;Obama,&quot; a take on the Toto song &quot;Rosanna&quot;; and &quot;Mr. Jefferson&quot;, a rendition of the Simon &amp; Garfunkel song &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;.

His show was aired on SIRIUS XM Patriot, SIRIUS and XM channel 125 Monday through Friday from 6:00 am – 9:00 am Eastern Time Zone. Shows were generally aired live, with an occasional rebroadcast of a previous show. The show was also later rebroadcast on SIRIUS XM Patriot Plus, SIRIUS 816, and XM 138 (online only) from 12 midnight to 3 am. His show was broadcast live from self-supported studios in Mandeville, Louisiana, a suburb of New Orleans.

The Mike Church Band was a part of the show, which provided conservative-themed parody songs as comedic elements to the sociocultural topics of discussion, most of which were aimed at the political left. Headed up by Mike Church, the band has released albums including &quot;UnAmerican Idiots&quot; (2005), &quot;Libs on the Run&quot; (2007), and &quot;The White Album&quot; (2008).

Church is also the author, producer, and voice talent behind three documentaries: 
*&quot;Road to Independence&quot; – the story of the United States Declaration of Independence;
* &quot;The Fame of Our Fathers: How Immortality Inspired Our Constitution&quot;;
* &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; – writing and ratifying the U.S. Constitution. 
The three documentaries, taken from source material, including personal letters, notes, and transcripts of debates, portrayed the Founding Fathers in their own words. The first two projects were originally audio-only documentaries, while &quot;Spirit of &#x27;76&quot; is animated. Church has also adapted &quot;Road to Independence&quot; into an animated feature.

Following the cancellation of his show on satellite radio, Church formed a new streaming online service, Veritas Radio Network, which carries a new version of his program and content from other hosts. The new network and programming launched on Wednesday, November 11, 2015.

<doc id="631995" wikidata="Q623692" url="?curid=631995" title="Sign of the cross">
<text>Making the sign of the cross (), also known as blessing oneself or crossing oneself, is a ritual blessing made by members of some branches of Christianity. This blessing is made by the tracing of an upright cross or Greek cross across the body with the right hand, often accompanied by spoken or mental recitation of the Trinitarian formula: &quot;In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.&quot;

The use of the sign of the cross traces back to early Christianity, with the third-century treatise &quot;Apostolic Tradition&quot; directing that it be used during the minor exorcism of baptism, during ablutions before praying at fixed prayer times, and in times of temptation.

The movement is the tracing of the shape of a cross in the air or on one&#x27;s own body, echoing the traditional shape of the cross of the crucifixion of Jesus. Where this is done with fingers joined, there are two principal forms: one—three fingers (to represent the Trinity), right to left—is exclusively used by the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Church of the East, Eastern Lutheran Churches and the Eastern Catholic Churches in the Byzantine and Syriac Christian traditions; the other—left to right to middle, other than three fingers—sometimes used in the Latin Church of the Catholic Church, Lutheranism, Anglicanism and in Oriental Orthodoxy. The sign of the cross is used in some denominations of Methodism and within some branches of Presbyterianism such as the Church of Scotland and in the PCUSA and some other Reformed Churches. The ritual is rare within other branches of Protestantism.

Many individuals use the expression &quot;cross my heart and hope to die&quot; as an oath, making the sign of the cross, in order to show &quot;truthfulness and sincerity&quot;, sworn before God, in both personal and legal situations.

==Origins==
The sign of the cross was originally made in some parts of the Christian world with the right-hand thumb across the forehead only. In other parts of the early Christian world it was done with the whole hand or with two fingers. Around the year 200 in Carthage (modern Tunisia, Africa), Tertullian wrote: &quot;We Christians wear out our foreheads with the sign of the cross.&quot; Hippolytus of Rome, in his Apostolic Tradition, recommends sealing oneself the forehead in times of temptation, with it being described as the &quot;Sign of the Passion.&quot; Vestiges of this early variant of the practice remain: in the Roman Rite of the Mass in the Catholic Church, the celebrant makes this gesture on the Gospel book and—together with the congregation—on his forehead, lips, and on his heart at the proclamation of the Gospel (known as the lesser sign of the cross); on Ash Wednesday a cross is traced in ashes on the forehead; chrism is applied, among places on the body, on the forehead for the Holy Mystery of Chrismation in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==Gesture==
The actual motion of the sign of the cross is heavily disputed, the Byzantine orthodox states the right to left motion to be the more ancient way whereas writings by Bar Salibi and other Syriac prose writers show that the left to right motion predates the right to left signage. Western Catholics (the Latin Church) have made the motion from left to right, while Eastern Catholics follow the traditional signage of right to left.

In the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic (Eastern Catholics) churches, the tips of the first three fingers (the thumb, index, and middle ones) are brought together, and the last two (the &quot;ring&quot; and little fingers) are pressed against the palm. The first three fingers express one&#x27;s faith in the Trinity, while the remaining two fingers represent the two natures of Jesus, divine and human.

=== Motion ===
The sign of the cross is made by touching the hand sequentially to the forehead, lower chest or stomach, and both shoulders, accompanied by the Trinitarian formula: at the forehead &quot;In the name of the Father&quot; (or in Latin); at the stomach or heart &quot;and of the Son&quot; (); across the shoulders &quot;and of the Holy Spirit/Ghost&quot; (); and finally: &quot;Amen&quot;.

There are several interpretations, according to Church Fathers: the forehead symbolizes Heaven; the solar plexus (or top of stomach), the earth; the shoulders, the place and sign of power. It also recalls both the Trinity and the Incarnation. Pope Innocent III (1198–1216) explained: &quot;The sign of the cross is made with three fingers, because the signing is done together with the invocation of the Trinity.[...] This is how it is done: from above to below, and from the right to the left, because Christ descended from the heavens to the earth&quot;.

There are some variations: for example a person may first place the right hand in holy water. After moving the hand from one shoulder to the other, it may be returned to the top of the stomach. It may also be accompanied by the recitation of a prayer (e.g., the Jesus Prayer, or simply &quot;Lord have mercy&quot;). In some Catholic regions, like Spain, Italy and Latin America, it is customary to form a cross with the index finger and thumb and then to kiss one&#x27;s thumb at the conclusion of the gesture.

=== Sequence ===
Cyril of Jerusalem (315–386) wrote in his book about the Smaller Sign of the Cross:



John of Damascus (650–750) stated:

Herbert Thurston indicates that at one time both Eastern and Western Christians moved the hand from the right shoulder to the left. German theologian Valentin Thalhofer thought writings quoted in support of this point, such as that of Innocent III, refer to the small cross made upon the forehead or external objects, in which the hand moves naturally from right to left, and not the big cross made from shoulder to shoulder. Andreas Andreopoulos, author of &quot;The Sign of the Cross&quot;, gives a more detailed description of the development and the symbolism of the placement of the fingers and the direction of the movement.

==Use==
===Catholicism===
Within the Roman Catholic Church, the sign of the cross is a sacramental, which the Church defines as &quot;sacred signs which bear a resemblance to the sacraments&quot;; that &quot;signify effects, particularly of a spiritual nature, which are obtained through the intercession of the Church&quot;; and that &quot;always include a prayer, often accompanied by a specific sign, such as the laying on of hands, the sign of the cross, or the sprinkling of holy water (which recalls Baptism).&quot; Section 1670 of the Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) states, &quot;Sacramentals do not confer the grace of the Holy Spirit in the way that the sacraments do, but by the Church&#x27;s prayer, they prepare us to receive grace and dispose us to cooperate with it. For well-disposed members of the faithful, the liturgy of the sacraments and sacramentals sanctifies almost every event of their lives with the divine grace which flows from the Paschal mystery of the Passion, Death, and Resurrection of Christ.&quot; Section 1671 of the CCC states: &quot;Among sacramentals blessings (of persons, meals, objects, and places) come first. Every blessing praises God and prays for his gifts. In Christ, Christians are blessed by God the Father &#x27;with every spiritual blessing.&#x27; This is why the Church imparts blessings by invoking the name of Jesus, usually while making the holy sign of the cross of Christ.&quot; Section 2157 of the CCC states: &quot;The Christian begins his day, his prayers, and his activities with the Sign of the Cross: &#x27;in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.&#x27; The baptized person dedicates the day to the glory of God and calls on the Savior&#x27;s grace which lets him act in the Spirit as a child of the Father. The sign of the cross strengthens us in temptations and difficulties.&quot;

John Vianney said a genuinely made Sign of the Cross &quot;makes all hell tremble.&quot;

The Catholic Church&#x27;s Ordinary Form of the Roman Rite, the priest and the faithful make the Sign of the Cross at the conclusion of the Entrance Chant and the priest or deacon &quot;makes the Sign of the Cross [i.e the lesser sign of the cross] on the book and on his forehead, lips, and breast&quot; when announcing the Gospel text (to which the people acclaim: &quot;Glory to you, O Lord&quot;).

The sign of the cross is expected at two points in the Mass: the laity sign themselves during the introductory greeting of the service and at the final blessing; optionally, other times during the Mass when the laity often cross themselves are during a blessing with holy water, when concluding the penitential rite, in imitation of the priest before the Gospel reading (small signs on forehead, lips, and heart), and perhaps at other times out of personal devotion.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===

In the Eastern Orthodox Churches, use of the sign of the cross in worship is far more frequent than in the Western churches. While there are points in liturgy at which almost all worshipers cross themselves, Orthodox faithful have significant freedom to make the sign at other times as well, and many make the sign frequently throughout Divine Liturgy or other church services. During the epiclesis (the invocation of the Holy Spirit as part of the consecration of the Eucharist), the priest makes the sign of the cross over the bread. The early theologian Basil of Caesarea noted the use of the sign of the cross in the rite marking the admission of catechumens.

====Old Believers====
In the Tsardom of Russia, until the reforms of Patriarch Nikon in the 17th century, it was customary to make the sign of the cross with two fingers. The enforcement of the three-finger sign (as opposed to the two-finger sign of the &quot;Old Rite&quot;), as well as other Nikonite reforms (which alternated certain previous Russian practices to conform with Greek customs), were among the reasons for the schism with the Old Believers whose congregations continue to use the two-finger sign of the cross (other points of dispute included iconography and iconoclasm, as well as changes in liturgical practices). The Old Believers considered the two-fingered symbol to symbolize the dual nature of Christ as divine and human (the other three fingers in the palm representing the Trinity).

===Protestant traditions===
====Lutheranism====
Among Lutherans the practice was widely retained. For example, Luther&#x27;s Small Catechism states that it is expected before the morning and evening prayers. &quot;The Lutheran Hymnal&quot; (1941) of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) states that &quot;The sign of the cross may be made at the Trinitarian Invocation and at the words of the Nicene Creed &#x27;and the life of the world to come. In the present-day, the sign of the cross is customary throughout the Divine Service. Rubrics in contemporary Lutheran worship manuals, including &quot;Evangelical Lutheran Worship&quot; of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and &quot;Lutheran Service Book&quot; used by LCMS and Lutheran Church–Canada, provide for making the sign of the cross at certain points in the liturgy. The sign of the cross is made with three fingers, starting with touching the head, touching the chest (heart) and then going from the right shoulder to the left shoulder.

====Anglican and Episcopal traditions====
The English Reformation reduced the use of the sign of the cross compared to its use in Catholic rites. The 1549 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; reduced the use of the sign of the cross by clergy during liturgy to five occasions, although an added note (&quot;As touching, kneeling, crossing, holding up of hands, and other gestures; they may be used or left as every man&#x27;s devotion serveth, without blame&quot;) gave more leeway to the faithful to make the sign. The 1552 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; (revised in 1559) reduced the five set uses to a single usage, during baptism. The form of the sign was touching the head, chest, then both shoulders.

The use of the mandatory sign of the cross during baptism was one of several points of contention between the established Church of England and Puritans, who objected to this sole mandatory sign of the cross, and its connections to the church&#x27;s Catholic past. Nonconformists refused to use the sign. In addition to its Catholic associations, the sign of the cross was significant in English folk traditions, with the sign believed to have a protective function against evil. Puritans viewed the sign of the cross as superstitious and idolatrous. Use of the sign of the cross during baptism was defended by King James I at the Hampton Court Conference and by the 1604 Code of Canons, and its continued use was one of many factors in the departure of Puritans from the Church of England.

The 1789 Prayer Book of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America made the sign of the cross during baptism optional, apparently in concession to varying views within the church on the sign&#x27;s use. The 1892 revision of the Prayer Book, however, made the sign mandatory. The Anglo-Catholic movement saw a resurgence in the use of the sign of the cross within Anglicanism, including by laity and in church architecture and decoration; historically, &quot;high church&quot; Anglicans were more apt to make the sign of the cross than &quot;low church&quot; Anglicans. Objections to the use of the sign of the cross within Anglicanism were largely dropped in the 20th century. In some Anglican traditions, the sign of the cross is made by priests when consecrating the bread and wine of the Eucharist and when giving the priestly blessing at the end of a church service, and is made by congregants when receiving Communion. More recently, some Anglican bishops have adopted the Roman Catholic practice of placing a sign of the cross (+) before their signatures.

====Methodism====
The sign of the cross can be found in the Methodist liturgy of the United Methodist Church. John Wesley, the principal leader of the early Methodists, in a 1784 revision of &quot;The Book of Common Prayer&quot; for Methodist use called &quot;The Sunday Service of the Methodists in North America&quot;, instructed the presiding minister to make the sign of the cross on the forehead of children just after they have been baptized. (This book was later adopted by Methodists in the United States for their liturgy.) Wesley did not include the sign of the cross in other rites.

By the early 20th century, the use of the sign of the cross had been dropped from American Methodist worship. However, its uses was subsequently restored, and the current United Methodist Church allows the pastor to &quot;trace on the forehead of each newly baptized person the sign of the cross.&quot; This usage during baptism is reflected in the current (1992) &quot;Book of Worship of the United Methodist Church&quot;, and is widely practiced (sometimes with oil). Making of the sign is also common among United Methodists on Ash Wednesday, when it is applied by the elder to the foreheads of the laity as a mark of penitence. In some United Methodist congregations, the worship leader makes the sign of the cross toward congregants (for example, when blessing the congregation at the end of the sermon or service), and individual congregants make the sign on themselves when receiving Holy Communion. The sign is also sometimes made by pastors, with oil, upon the foreheads of those seeking healing. In addition to its use in baptism, some Methodist clergy make the sign at the Communion table and during the Confession of Sin and Pardon at the invocation of Jesus&#x27; name.

Whether or not a Methodist uses the sign for private prayer is a personal choice, although the UMC encourages it as a devotional practice, stating: &quot;Many United Methodists have found this restoration powerful and meaningful. The ancient and enduring power of the sign of the cross is available for us to use as United Methodists more abundantly now than ever in our history. And more and more United Methodists are expanding its use beyond those suggested in our official ritual.&quot;

==== Reformed tradition (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, and Congregationalist) ====
In some Reformed churches, such as the Church of Scotland and Presbyterian Church (USA), the sign of the cross is used on the foreheads during baptism and the Reaffirmation of the Baptismal Covenant. It is also used at times during the Benediction, the minister will make the sign of the cross out toward the congregation while invoking the Trinity.

===Armenian Apostolic===
It is common practice in the Armenian Apostolic Church to make the sign of the cross when entering or passing a church, during the start of service and at many times during Divine Liturgy. The motion is performed by joining the first three fingers, to symbolize the Holy Trinity, and putting the two other fingers in the palm, then touching one&#x27;s forehead, below the chest, left side, then right side and finishing with open hand on the chest again with bowing head.

===Assyrian Church of the East===
The Assyrian Church of the East uniquely holds the sign of the cross as a sacrament in its own right. Another sacrament unique to the church is the Holy Leaven.

<doc id="631998" wikidata="Q160408" url="?curid=631998" title="Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp">
<text>Płaszów () or Kraków-Płaszów was a Nazi concentration camp operated by the SS in Płaszów, a southern suburb of Kraków, in the General Governorate of German-occupied Poland. Most of the prisoners were Polish Jews who were targeted for destruction by Nazi Germany during the Holocaust. Many prisoners died because of executions, forced labor, and the poor conditions in the camp. The camp was evacuated in January 1945, before the Red Army&#x27;s liberation of the area on 20 January.

==History==
Originally intended as a forced labour camp, the Płaszów concentration camp was constructed on the grounds of two former Jewish cemeteries (including the New Jewish Cemetery). It was populated with prisoners during the liquidation of the Kraków Ghetto, which took place on 13–14 March 1943 with the first deportations of the &quot;Barrackenbau&quot; Jews from the Ghetto beginning 28 October 1942. In 1943 the camp was expanded and integrated into the Nazi concentration camp system as a main camp.

== Camp operation ==

=== Structure and function ===
The Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp was divided into multiple sections. There was a separate area for camp personnel, work facilities, male prisoners, female prisoners, and a further subdivision between Jews and non-Jews. Although separated, men and women still managed to have contact with one another. There was also a private barracks for the camp&#x27;s Jewish police and their families. While the primary function of the camp was forced labor, the camp was also the site of mass murder of inmates as well as prisoners brought in from the outside. The main targets were the elderly and the sick. There were no gas chambers or crematoria, so mass murder was carried out by shootings.

=== Personnel ===
Under Arnold Büscher, the camp&#x27;s second commandant, prisoners did not experience any shootings or hangings. However, by 1943, the camp was notorious for its terrors. Amon Göth, an SS commandant from Vienna, was the camp commandant at this point. He was sadistic in his treatment and killing of prisoners. &quot;Witnesses say he would never start his breakfast without shooting at least one person.&quot; On Göth&#x27;s first day as camp commandant, he killed two Jewish policemen and made every camp inmate watch. On 13 March 1943, he oversaw the liquidation of the nearby Kraków Ghetto, forcing those Jewish inhabitants deemed capable of work into the &quot;KL Plaszow&quot; camp. Those who were declared unfit for work were either sent to Auschwitz or shot on the spot. People were told to leave their children behind and that they would be cared for. In reality, they were all put in an orphanage and killed. Others snuck their children into the camp. If a prisoner tried to escape the camp, Göth shot 10 prisoners as a punishment. Göth would also release his Great Danes on prisoners if he did not like their expressions. He oversaw a staff that was mostly non-German. It consisted of 206 Ukrainian &quot;SS&quot; personnel from the Trawniki, 600 Germans of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; (1943–1944), and a few &quot;SS&quot; women, including Gertrud Heise, Luise Danz and Alice Orlowski.

The female guards treated the prisoners as brutally as the men: &quot;When we were loaded on the train in Płaszów, an SS woman hit me on the head. They were so vicious and brutal and sadistic, more than men. I think because some of them were women and you expect kindness, it was shocking. But of course, some were fat and big and ugly.&quot;

Jewish police were recruited by the camp personnel. They were provided with double rations of thick soup, as opposed to the standard watery soup, and a full loaf of uncontaminated bread. However, the benefits came with cost of having to whip inmates with the whips that the Nazis provided.

On 13 September 1944, Göth was relieved of his position and charged by the SS with theft of Jewish property (which belonged to the state, according to Nazi legislation), failure to provide adequate food to the prisoners under his charge, violation of concentration camp regulations regarding the treatment and punishment of prisoners, and allowing unauthorised access to camp personnel records by prisoners and non-commissioned officers. Camp administration was assumed by SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Arnold Büscher. He improved the inmates&#x27; diets by allowing eggs, sugar and powdered milk.

=== Prisoner victims ===

==== Life in the camp ====
The camp was an &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; (&quot;labour camp&quot;), supplying forced labour to several armament factories and to a stone quarry. Most of the prisoners were Polish Jews. There were also high numbers of women and children compared with other camps. A large degree of the Hungarian prisoners were women. The death rate in the camp was very high. Many prisoners died of typhus, starvation, and from executions. Because the work facilities were designed for men, the women had a lower chance of survival. Płaszów camp became particularly infamous for both the individual and the mass shootings carried out at Hujowa Górka: a large hill close to the camp commonly used for executions. Some 8,000 deaths took place outside the camp&#x27;s fences, with prisoners trucked in three to four times weekly. The covered lorries from Kraków would arrive in the morning. The condemned were walked into a trench of the Hujowa Górka hillside, ordered to strip down and stand naked, and then were finally shot. Their bodies were then covered with dirt, layer upon layer. During these mass shootings, all other inmates were forced to watch. In early 1944, all corpses were exhumed and burned on a pyre to obliterate the evidence of the mass murder. Witnesses later testified that 17 truckloads of human ashes were removed from the burning site and scattered over the area.

Although food was scarce, inmates that possessed any number of zlotys could buy extra food. A food for food trading system also developed. For example, two portions of soup was equal to a half loaf of bread.

When Göth received notice of a new shipment of inmates, he would set up deportations for Auschwitz. On 14 May 1944 Göth ordered all children to be sent to the &quot;kindergarten&quot;. This turned out only to be a precursor to deportation to Auschwitz on 15 May where the children were all gassed.

Göth entrusted documents pertaining to the mass killings and executions to a high ranking female member of the SS, &quot;Kommandoführerin&quot; Alice Orlowski. She held these documents in her possession until the end of the war, then allegedly destroyed them. Orlowski was known for her whippings, especially of young women across their eyes. At roll call she would walk through the lines of women and whip them.

==== Outside aid ====
Prisoners could also rely on outside help to some degree. The Jüdische Unterstützungsstelle, a support group that the Germans tolerated, would provide the inmates with food and medical assistance. The Zehnerschaft was a group of women that also supported the inmates. The Polish Welfare Organization sent food to Polish prisoners and some of them shared with the Jewish inmates. There were also individuals such as Stanislaw Dobrowolski, the head of the Kraków branch of the Council for Aid to Jews (Żegota), and Tadeusz Pankiewicz, a famous pharmacist, also aided the prisoners.

==== Punishments ====
Göth and the other camp personnel punished inmates for a variety of actions. Any action perceived as sabotage, such as smuggling items into the camp, disobeying orders, or carrying an extra piece of food in one&#x27;s clothes was an offense punishable by death. Prisoners were warned that if they tried to escape, every member of their family and even innocent strangers would be killed. In terms of methods for killing, death by hanging was a favored method of Göth&#x27;s. For a standard punishment, twenty-five lashings were dealt to the guilty inmate&#x27;s buttocks.

==== Hope for the prisoners ====
While prisoners&#x27; daily lives were dominated by fear and starvation, there were some outlets for hope of survival. Rumors involving the Russian advancement that would lead to the camp&#x27;s liberation always circulated. Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party who saved the 1,200 Schindlerjuden, was also a key figure. While prisoners always feared a transport to Auschwitz, one that was always sought after was a transport to Brünnlitz labor camp in Czechoslovakia. This is where Oskar Schindler&#x27;s enamel factory was located. Schindler was known for being compassionate towards Jews. He never hit anyone, was always kind, and smiled frequently around the workers. Having relatives and friends that worked for Schindler gave one a better chance at being put on the list for transport.

==== Hiding the evidence ====
During July and August 1944, a number of transports of prisoners left &quot;KL Płaszow&quot; for Auschwitz, Stutthof, Flossenburg, Mauthausen, and other camps. In January 1945, the last of the remaining inmates and camp staff left the camp on a death march to Auschwitz. Several female SS guards were part of the group that accompanied them. Many of those who survived the march were killed upon arrival. When the Nazis realized the Soviets were approaching Kraków, they completely dismantled the camp, leaving only an empty field. All bodies that had been previously buried in various mass graves were exhumed and burned on site. On 20 January 1945, the Red Army arrived and found only a patch of barren land.

=== Aftermath ===
Most numbers of inmates and killings rely on estimation, as the prisoner card index was destroyed during the camp&#x27;s destruction. Few postwar trials centered on crimes committed at the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp; one exception was Göth&#x27;s trial and subsequent death sentence. West German prosecutors took until the late 1950s to investigate these crimes.

==Commemoration==
The area which held the camp now consists of sparsely wooded hills and fields, with one large memorial to all the victims and two smaller monuments (one to the Jewish victims generally, and another to the Hungarian Jewish victims) at one perimeter of where the camp once stood. The Jewish cemetery, where the Nazis removed all but one of the tombstones, stands on the side of the hill at the eastern end of the camp, near the Grey house. Amon Göth&#x27;s villa remains there. Another small monument, located near the opposite end of the site, stands in memory of the first execution of (non-Jewish) Polish prisoners in 1939.

A version of the camp is featured in the movie &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), about the life of Oskar Schindler.
As the Płaszów area is now a nature preserve and modern high-rise apartments were visible from the site, the director Steven Spielberg replicated the camp in the nearby Liban Quarry, which also served as a labor camp during the war.

Each year, it is the finishing point of the March of Remembrance taking part in mid-March to manifest the respect to the victims of the Holocaust.

<text>Eirug Wyn (11 December 1950 – 25 April 2004) was a Welsh satirical novelist who wrote in the Welsh language. He was born Eirug Price Wynne, in Llanbrynmair in Mid Wales, and educated at Brynrefail School and Trinity College, Carmarthen. He subsequently made his home in Y Groeslon in North Wales.

At the age of 17 he appeared in court accused of not placing an L-plate on the back of his car, as was required in the United Kingdom for anyone learning to drive. Instead, he had placed a similar plate bearing the letter &quot;D&quot;, for &quot;&quot;, the Welsh equivalent. The eventual outcome of this case was to make D-plates a legally recognised equivalent to L-plates throughout Wales.

He wrote 15 books in the twelve years before his death, and won several prizes for his work at Eisteddfodau, including the prose medal in 1998 and 2000 and the Daniel Owen medal for novelists in 1994 and 2002. He also ran a bookshop, Siop y Pentan, in Caernarfon; wrote a column for the &quot;Western Mail&quot;; and edited &quot;Lol!&quot;, a satirical magazine.

He died of myeloma on 25 April 2004, at the age of 53.

<text>Eliezer () was the name of at least three different individuals in the Hebrew Bible.

== Eliezer of Damascus ==

Eliezer of Damascus () was, according to Targum Jonathan Bereishit, 14:14, the son of Nimrod. As mentioned in Genesis 15:2, Eliezer was head of the patriarch Abraham&#x27;s household.
Medieval biblical exegetes have explained the noun &quot;ben mešeq&quot; as meaning &quot;butler; steward; overseer&quot;, while the name &quot;Damméseq Eliʿézer&quot; is explained by Targum Onkelos as meaning &quot;Eliezer the Damascene.&quot; Others say that he was given the name &quot;Damascus&quot; by Abraham, who purchased Eliezer from Nimrod and had passed through the city of Damascus while returning with his servant from Babylonia. Other translations of Genesis describe Eliezer as Abraham&#x27;s heir.

There is an interpretation in Genesis Rabbah (43:2), cited by Rashi, that Eliezer went alone with Abraham to rescue Lot, about &quot;his initiates&quot; stated to be 318 in number being the numerical value of Eliezer&#x27;s name in Hebrew, interpreted in tractate Nedarim (32a) as Abraham not wishing to rely on a miracle by taking only one individual.

===The servant of Abraham===
According to most interpretations, the unnamed &quot;senior servant of (Abraham&#x27;s) household, who had charge of all that he owned,&quot; in Genesis 24:2, who obtained Rebecca as a bride for Isaac, was the same Eliezer. This name is first found in the Bible in Genesis 15:2 when Abraham asks God about his promises of a son while being childless, naming Eliezer as the heir of his house. 

==The son of Moses==
Eliezer was Moses&#x27;s and Zipporah&#x27;s second son. His name means &quot;Help of my God&quot;. The verse in the Exodus 18:4 states, &quot;[T]he other was named Eliezer, meaning, &#x27;The God of my father’s [house] was my help, delivering me from the sword of Pharaoh.&#x27;&quot; Gershom and Eliezer were born after Moses had taken refuge in Midian and married Jethro&#x27;s daughter Zipporah.

==Eliezer the prophet==
A prophet called Eliezer, son of Dodavah, rebuked King Jehoshaphat of Judah for aligning himself with King Ahaziah of Israel. Jehosophat and Ahaziah built ships in Ezion-Geber, which were to sail to Tarshish for trade. According to 2 Chronicles 20:37, the ships sank due to his not relying on God:

<text>Jubail (, &quot;Al Jubayl&quot;) is a city in the Eastern province on the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia, with a total population of 474,679 as of 2022. It is home to one of the largest industrial cities in the world. It is also home to the Middle East&#x27;s largest and world&#x27;s fourth largest petrochemical company SABIC. It has the world&#x27;s largest IWPP (Independent Water and Power Project) producing 2743.6 MW of electricity and 800,000 m3 of water daily. 

Jubail comprises the Old Town of Al Jubail (Jubail Balad), which was a small fishing village until 1975, and the Industrial Area. Jubail Industrial City is the largest civil engineering project in the world today. In 1975, the Saudi government designated Jubail as the site for new industrial city, with rapid expansion and industrialization arising. The new industrial and residential areas were named Madīnat al Jubayl aṣ Ṣinā`īyah (Jubail Industrial City). The 2005 Census Report for Jubail Industrial City estimates the population at 224,430 residents.

==History==

The town of Al-Jubail, on the Arabian Gulf coast of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, has ancient roots. Human habitation dates back at least 7,000 years, when the people of Dilmun — whose civilization radiated up and down the coast of the Arabian Gulf — established a settlement there.
Archaeological place: Crease Tower or Tuwayah Tower was constructed around 1928. It was key source of water for Jubail.
In September 1933, Jubail gained a measure of fame as the landing site for the first team of geologists to explore for oil in Saudi Arabia.

The origins of Jubail date back to the early Islamic period when it was known as &#x27;Aynayn (), meaning &quot;two springs.&quot; The settlement was known for its sweet water springs, date palm groves, and its status as a cultural and literary center. 

At some point, the original settlement of &#x27;Aynayn was abandoned. The modern town of Jubail was established around 1911 and became a center for fishing and pearling. The town came under Saudi rule in 1913 when King &#x27;Abd al-Aziz regained the al-Hasa Province. 

=== 1930s ===
Jubail experienced economic challenges during the 20th century. The global economic depression and the rise of Japan’s cultured pearl industry in the 1930s caused a decline in the traditional pearling trade, which had been a key industry for the town. At its peak, Jubail had supported over 200 pearling boats, but this number rapidly dwindled as cultured pearls became dominant.

The arrival of oil exploration teams in the 1930s briefly revitalized the town. Jubail was chosen as a base for early geological surveys due to its harbor, freshwater springs, and favorable terrain. On September 23, 1933, geologists from Standard Oil Company of California, including Robert Miller, Schuyler &quot;Krug&quot; Henry, and Karl Twitchell, arrived in Jubail to conduct exploratory work. However, as oil exploration activities shifted to Dhahran and Khobar, Jubail reverted to being a minor fishing center.

=== Modern Development ===
Prior to its industrial transformation, Jubail was primarily a fishing community. As of 1972, the town boasted a fishing fleet of approximately 160 boats, with catches including shrimp and small sharks that were renowned as far as Kuwait and Riyadh. 

Jubail’s transformation began in the early 1970s when the Saudi government initiated plans to develop it into a major industrial city. This initiative was part of a broader strategy to diversify the Kingdom&#x27;s economy and leverage its vast natural gas reserves. Jubail was selected as the site for a massive industrial complex due to its strategic location and existing infrastructure.

The city&#x27;s redevelopment included the construction of refineries, petrochemical plants, steel mills, aluminum facilities, and desalination plants. To support this industrialization, extensive infrastructure was developed, including new ports, roads, pipelines, and an airport. Thousands of workers were relocated to Jubail to operate the facilities, and the city was redesigned to accommodate the growing population.

Today, Jubail is home to the Jubail Industrial City, one of the world&#x27;s largest petrochemical industrial hubs, managed by the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu. It is a cornerstone of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s industrial and economic strategy, contributing significantly to the country&#x27;s non-oil exports.

== Jubail Industrial City ==

It is the world&#x27;s largest industrial city established in 1975. It covers 1,016 square kilometers and includes industrial complexes, major harbour and port facilities. It contributes to about 7% of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s GDP.

Bechtel began work on the Jubail Industrial City project more than 40 years ago and is still working in Jubail now. Bechtel has managed the Jubail project since it began in the mid-1970s, and in 2004 the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu asked the company to manage Jubail II, a $3.8 billion expansion of the city&#x27;s industrial and residential areas.


==Transportation==

===Highway===
Jubail is directly connected with other cities by two major highways; Dhahran-Jubail Highway and Abu Hadriyah Highway.

One ongoing project is the Jubail-Qassim (Buraidah) Expressway , which will reduce the distance between Jubail and Qassim (Buraidah) to around from the current .

===Railway===
A branch of the Saudi Landbridge Project railway is proposed to connect Jubail to Dammam.

===Seaport===
There are two seaports in Jubail—the Jubail Commercial Seaport and the King Fahd Industrial Seaport. As of 2011, Jubail ranks 92nd in the world in terms of Total Cargo Volume with 44,700 tons.

===Airport===
The city is served by King Fahd International Airport.

Jubail Naval Airport is an airfield 25 kilometres (16 mi) west of Jubail City, near the industrial area. Originally constructed by the Royal Commission of Jubail and Yanbu as part of Jubail project, it was meant to be used for commercial aviation until it was decided to utilize the large nearby King Fahd International Airport. Thus, it was handed over to the Ministry of Defence and has been used as a base for the naval aviation group/eastern fleet of the Royal Saudi Navy since then. The terminal in Dammam Airport is about 60 km drive from the suburbs of Jubail, 80 km from the city center and 100 km from the Royal Commission neighborhoods.

However it was recently announced that the airport will be opened for private aviation operations starting September 2014. A project to renovate the airfield was undertaken since some of the airfield&#x27;s infrastructure was incomplete, as a result of the previous change for the use of airport from commercial to military. To date, the project and renovations have not been completed.

In addition, two other airfields are located in the city; Abu Ali Airport is located in the Island of Abu Ali while the other is located in King Abdulaziz Naval Base.

== Main sights ==
Jubail has a robust market place, known as International Market. It also has several malls, such as Fanateer Mall, Galleria Mall, Jubail Center Mall, Fanateer Beach, City Max, Hyper-Panda, Panda, Banana Beach, Jubail Centre, Home Center, Red Tag, Centrepoint, Jalmudah Hills, Jubail Plaza, Jubail RTV Riding Arena and Jubail Mall.

<doc id="632016" wikidata="Q233201" url="?curid=632016" title="Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth">
<text>Louise Renée de Penancoët de Kéroualle, Duchess of Portsmouth (5 September 1649 – 14 November 1734) was a French mistress of King Charles II of England. She was also made Duchesse d&#x27;Aubigny in the peerage of France.

==Early life==

Louise was the daughter of Count Guillaume de Penancoët, Seigneur de Kéroualle (1615-1690), and his wife, Marie de Plœuc, Dame de Timeur et de Kergorlay (1625-1709). The Kérouaille family were nobles in Brittany, and their name was so spelt by themselves. The form &quot;Quérouaille&quot; was commonly used in England. All are derivations of the original Breton name Kerouazle, which is the most common form in Brittany. Her sister, Henriette Mauricette de Penancoët de Kérouaille, married firstly in 1674 Philip Herbert, 7th Earl of Pembroke, and secondly in 1685 Jean-Timoléon Gouffier, Marquis de Thais. Her aunt Suzanne de Penancoët married Claude Le Veyer; their daughter Catherine became the matriarch of the Saisy de Kerampuil family.

==Mistress to Charles II==
De Kéroualle was introduced early to the household of Henrietta Anne Stuart, Duchess of Orléans, sister of King Charles II of Great Britain, and sister-in-law of King Louis XIV of France. The diarist Saint-Simon asserts that her family threw her in the way of Louis XIV in the hope that she would become a royal mistress. In 1670, she accompanied Henrietta on a visit to Charles II at Dover. The sudden death of Henrietta left her unprovided for, but Charles appointed her as a lady-in-waiting to his own queen, Catherine of Braganza. Unlike Charles&#x27; previous mistress Barbara Palmer, who had openly insulted the Queen, de Kéroualle was careful to show her every respect, and relations between the two women were never less than amicable. One possible reason for that is that Louise shared the queen&#x27;s Roman Catholic faith.


It was later said that the French court had selected de Kéroualle to fascinate Charles, but there seems to be no evidence for that. Yet when there appeared a prospect that Charles would show her favour, the intrigue was vigorously pushed by the French ambassador, Colbert de Croissy, who was aided by the English secretary of state Henry Bennet, 1st Earl of Arlington, and his wife.

De Kéroualle, who concealed cunning and ambition under an appearance of languor and a rather childlike beauty (diarist John Evelyn speaks of her &quot;&quot;), yielded to Charles&#x27; romantic advances only after she had established a strong hold on his affections. 

In 1672, de Kéroualle gave birth to Charles II&#x27;s son. On 19 August 1673, the titles of Baroness Petersfield, Countess of Fareham and Duchess of Portsmouth were granted to her for life. Her pensions and money allowances were enormous, £136,000 in 1681 alone. The French court gave her frequent presents and, in December 1673, at Charles II&#x27;s request, conferred upon her the title &quot;Duchess of Aubigny&quot; in the Peerage of France. Her son by the king, Charles (1672–1723), was created Duke of Richmond in 1675.

At about that time, the new Duchess of Portsmouth introduced a young Frenchman who proposed a solution to the longitude problem. While the proposal was ineffective, it led Charles to establish the Greenwich Royal Observatory and appoint John Flamsteed as Astronomer Royal.

The support Portsmouth received from the French envoy was given on the understanding that she should advance the interests of her native sovereign. The bargain was confirmed by gifts and honours from Louis XIV and was loyally carried out by Portsmouth, but she was much disliked by the English public. Louis XIV gave her a pair of earrings worth the astonishing sum of eighteen thousand pounds, his most expensive gift to England that year and more lavish than anything he had ever given Charles&#x27; queen.

Louise is mentioned in &quot;A Satyr on Charles II&quot;, a 1673 poetical lampoon at the King&#x27;s expense, written by John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester, in which she is referred to with her last name spelt Carwell. At that time Charles II himself happened to request a specific piece by Rochester—who, upon delivery, discerned that he had delivered directly into the hands of the King the impudent satire aimed at his person instead of the sought-after text. This led to Rochester&#x27;s abrupt flight from Court. Despite this incident, there appears to be evidence of the King&#x27;s continued friendship, as he acquired two coveted offices at the royal court. He did not finally meet with a prolonged banishment from Court until 1675, when he was condemned by Portsmouth and remained in banishment for the remaining five years before his death.

Portsmouth was openly distrusted and even hated in England due to her religion and nationality as well as her sinful role as mistress. Her work to secure alliances with and favours for France provoked strong resentment. Nell Gwynne, another of Charles&#x27; mistresses, called her &quot;Squintabella&quot; and, when mistaken for her, replied, &quot;Pray good people be civil, I am the &quot;Protestant&quot; whore.&quot;

Portsmouth&#x27;s thorough understanding of Charles&#x27; character enabled her to retain Charles&#x27; affections to the end. She contrived to escape uninjured during the crisis of the &quot;Popish Plot&quot; in 1678, and found an unexpected ally in Queen Catherine, who was grateful for the kindness and consideration Portsmouth had always shown her. She was strong enough to maintain her position during a long illness in 1677, and even after a visit to France in 1682. One of Charles&#x27; nicknames for her was &#x27;Fubbs&#x27;, meaning the plumpness thought ideal for the female form at the time; in 1682, Charles built the royal yacht HMY &quot;Fubbs&quot;. According to the French ambassador, she assisted in having Charles II received into the Catholic Church on his deathbed in 1685. That Charles was truly attached to her is shown by his dying instruction to his brother to &quot;do well by Portsmouth&quot;, making her one of three women in his life, along with the Queen and Nell Gwynne, who were in his thoughts at the end.

==After Charles II&#x27;s death==
Portsmouth quickly fell from favour after Charles II&#x27;s death. She retired to France, where she remained except for a short visit to England during the reign of James II and her attendance at the coronation of George I. Her attendance at George I&#x27;s coronation was remarked upon by the Countess of Dorchester when they met the Countess of Orkney (&quot;we three whores&quot;). Between them, they had been in turn the maîtresse en titre for successive kings for over 20 years. Her pensions and a grant on the Irish revenue Charles II gave her were lost either during James II&#x27;s reign or at the Revolution of 1688.

During her last years, Portsmouth lived at Aubigny under mounting debt, but she received a pension and protection against her creditors from king Louis XIV and later the regent Philippe II. Portsmouth died in Paris on 14 November 1734, aged 85.

<doc id="632022" wikidata="Q1547686" url="?curid=632022" title="Ground Control (video game)">
<text>Ground Control is a real-time tactics video game developed by Massive Entertainment and published by Sierra Studios, released for Microsoft Windows in 2000. The game focuses on a conflict between two factions vying for control of a planet and a series of alien artefacts contained on its surface, in which players take the role of an officer for each faction, working to achieve their objectives through using a variety of futuristic style of troops, engaging different tactics that make use of their units, the terrain and careful planning.

An expansion for the game was released later that year, before both it and the game were re-released together as a bundle pack called Ground Control Anthology, the following year. The game itself spawned a sequel titled &quot;Ground Control II: Operation Exodus&quot; in 2004, which improved upon the game&#x27;s graphics and game mechanics.

==Gameplay==
The game features full control over the camera, allowing the player to freely view each mission&#x27;s battlefield from any angle, from a bird&#x27;s-eye view to the perspective of one of their units at ground level. Because it is a real-time tactics game, &quot;Ground Control&quot; does not use the mechanics of resource and economic management as found in some real-time strategy games (such as &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;), discouraging players from conducting tank rush strategies. Instead, proper use of tactics with the units they have available is necessary in order to complete the objectives set out for them on each mission.

Before starting with a mission, players must first decide on what troops to bring to the battlefield, which are divided up into squads that must be loaded onto orbital dropships available to them so that they can be transported and deployed onto the battlefield once a mission starts (with some exceptions). As reinforcements cannot be called for during a mission, proper troop selection is important for each mission. Each dropship that can be loaded out with troops, up to a maximum of three depending on progress in the single player campaign, can carry a maximum of four squads each, with each squad consisting of units picked from one of four unit categories - vehicles, support, aircraft, and infantry - and of a specific role within the chosen category; one exception to the load out is the Command APC, which must be brought along on each mission, but does not take space away from another squad.

Because each type of unit type has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as a distinct role, various unit combinations are required in order to achieve success; a player could choose to lead squads of heavy armour to punch through enemy defences, but would need to co-ordinate support from infantry and anti-air to protect them from heavy fire, thus players can determine what role a squad plays by the type of unit they chose for it; a player could tactically choose to use heavy armour to punch a hole through enemy defences, while protecting the units with squads of anti-air support, or use scout units to recon and spot targets for artillery support to strike at. While most units of the game&#x27;s two factions have similarities in function to their equivalent on the other side, some units have notable differences between them. For example, while the Crayven Corporation has hardier units that rely on heavy armour, traditional ballistics and movement, the Order of the New Dawn&#x27;s units rely on a hover propulsion system for increased speed and mobility and use energy weaponry that give them more damage potential. In addition, each faction&#x27;s specialist troops are different to each other; while the Order&#x27;s Templar Infantry consist of an all-female squadron equipped with powerful anti-tank missile launchers who cannot attack infantry, the Crayven&#x27;s Jaeger Infantry consist of a four-man squad of snipers useful for scouting.

Along with choosing the right troops for a mission, each unit, except for the Command APC, has a choice of specialised weapons and pieces of equipment to choose from, although only one special weapon and one special piece of equipment can be loaded out on a squad for a mission, with both types having a finite number of uses available. Special weapons range from infantry mortars and anti-tank rockets to improved missiles and tactical nuclear warheads, which can either improve a squad&#x27;s effectiveness in its specialized role, or allow it to defeat targets which it would otherwise be virtually ineffective against. Meanwhile, special equipment can include medkits, repair kits, image intensifiers, afterburners, various stationary turrets, or, for one faction, repair stations. While most specials can usually be used two or three times by a squad during a mission, most of the powerful special abilities are limited to a single use.

Once troop selection is done and the units are deployed onto the battlefield, careful use of tactics needs to be employed by the player to ensure that they get the most out of the units they are using in a battle. The use of flanking maneuvers is a useful tactic to use, especially when facing against armoured units, which are much weaker to attacks from the sides, rear and from above, rather than a frontal assault. Taking advantage of high ground offers units a more tactical vantage point to strike at the topside weakness of armoured units, while increasing accuracy and sight range of units from such a position, which is a tactical bonus for artillery. Suppressive fire is also simulated by the game, in which units being suppressed will fire less accurately, thus it can be a useful tactic to weaken stronger opponents with; infantry units can effectively suppress heavy units such as tanks, even if the target is not taking any damage due to armor. Stealth can also be used on the battlefield; units can take advantage of shadows cast by higher terrain to camouflage themselves, while infantry can also use foliage to hide, thus scouting ahead to preempt any ambushes is often essential to protecting armoured units. Friendly fire is also taken into account, as units firing behind the front lines can shoot friendlies in their lines of fire, causing them damage, thus careful attention to squad placement is required.

If a player uses wise tactics to preserve their troops, any squads that survive a mission are rewarded with experience upon its completion, which can also include the awarding of medals awarded for a squad&#x27;s combat performance, granting them with improved abilities that can make them more efficient later on in the campaign. Any losses taken by a squad are replenished at the end of a mission, but if the whole squad is wiped out, they will not be replaced unless the player is playing on easier difficulty levels; if so, the new squad will start inexperienced.

==Plot==
Following the aftermath of the Third World War (known in the game as &quot;The Sixteen-Minute War&quot;) in the 25th century, mankind successfully rebuilds and begins colonization of several planets across the galaxy, while the Earth becomes ruled by the Global Central Command (GCC) - a council of elected representatives, including those from mega corporations that rose to power following the fall of Terran nations. Despite treaties set out by the GCC, conflict between the various powers spearheading colonization occurs daily, often over resources and trade routes. By the time the game begins, two powers assisting in colonization efforts, the Crayven Corporation and a religious sect known as the Order of the New Dawn, begin vying for total control over a distant world known as Krig 7-B.

Major Sarah Parker, an officer for the Crayven Corporation, is assigned by Enrica Hayes, a director in the company working aboard one of their starships, the CSS &quot;Astrid&quot;, to lead ground operations on Krig 7-B. During her assignments, Parker fails to rescue a defector from the Order called Bishop Delondre, but receives a data disk from him concerning an Order operation known only as &quot;Project Garm&quot;. Later into her operations while protecting an important Crayven facility, her team successfully secure an alien relic called a &quot;Xenofact&quot;, which prompts Hayes to order the destruction of Order bases that have secured other Xenofacts. Eventually, after the Order&#x27;s warship, the WCS Clergy, is driven from the planet&#x27;s orbit, Crayven forces successfully destroy the Order&#x27;s last remaining base in the planet&#x27;s northern polar region, and gain control over a Xenofact far larger than had been seen in their campaign. Satisfied with Parker&#x27;s efforts, Hayes orders Crayven forces to begin mopping up any Order stragglers left on the planet.

Seeking to prevent the corporation from achieving total victory on Krig 7-B, two officers of the Order, Deacon Jarred Stone and Paladin Magnus, Stone&#x27;s CO and an old friend, rally surviving troops in order to conduct a series of daring, guerrilla-styled hit and run missions, against high value targets of the Crayven, despite concerns that they fight a losing battle without the assistance of the Clergy. During their strikes, Stone and Magnus recover important data, which details more about Project Garm, providing insight on Delondre&#x27;s motive for defecting. Magnus soon disappears shortly after Aegeri, a &quot;Great Cardinal&quot; of the Order, arrives on board the WCS Retribution, with much needed reinforcements. While Aegeri questions some of the targets that Magnus chose, he soon directs Stone into continuing his strikes against Crayven forces. During an assault on a Crayven airbase, Magnus contacts Stone for a secret meeting, passing on Delondre&#x27;s ID code, among other codes, so that he can fully access all of the Project Garm data. After the mission, Stone discovers that both the Order and the Crayven seek control over the planet&#x27;s Xenofacts.

Shortly after a well organized Crayven assault is countered, resulting in the Order securing a Xenofact, Aegeri and Hayes meet and declare a ceasefire, forging an alliance between the two powers and creating a joint task-force aimed at unlocking the secrets of the Xenofacts. Angered and feeling betrayed, Stone reunites with Magnus to stop the alliance gaining full control over the Xenofacts, but their hidden base is soon besieged by a large Crayven force, leading Magnus to sacrificing himself in order for Stone and their troops to be safely extracted by Parker, who had discovered that Aegeri and Hayes had met up weeks before the ceasefire was announced. Working together alongside Magnus&#x27; friend Cole, a Crayven operative, they quickly discover that the Xenofacts found on the planet were among many created by an alien civilisation more than a million years ago, as part of an ancient, galaxy-wide fail-safe system designed to counter an invasion, in which each Xenofact contains a powerful war machine within it that can only be activated from Krig 7-B. The group quickly realise that both the Crayven and the Order sought control over the system so as to use it to gain complete control over the galaxy, and that Aegeri and Hayes now plan to carry this out together.

Seeking to stop this, Stone, Parker and Cole launch a desperate assault on the huge Xenofact, killing Aegeri while successfully destroying the artifact with DXT charges, which destroys the Retribution and sends both Hayes and the Astrid elsewhere in the system. While Parker, Cole and Stone celebrate their victory and saving millions of lives while trying to figure out how to leave Krig 7-B, Hayes contacts her boss in the Crayven Corporation and reports her failure at utilizing the Xenofacts, to which her employer remarks that there are still other ways to win control of the galaxy, as the Astrid drifts through space.

==Reception==

The game received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Jim Preston of &quot;NextGen&quot; was positive to its gameplay and graphics, and called the game &quot;gorgeous&quot;, &quot;intuitive&quot;, and &quot;simple&quot;.

The staff of &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; nominated it for their 2000 &quot;Real-time Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, whose winner remains unknown. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s &quot;2000 Strategy Game of the Year&quot; award, which ultimately went to &quot;The Sims&quot;. The staff wrote: &quot;Great graphics, great sound, and great multiplayer -- what&#x27;s not to like?&quot; The game was nominated for the &quot;Best Graphics, Technical&quot; and &quot;Strategy Game of the Year&quot; awards at &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, both of which went to &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. It was also nominated for the RTS Game of the Year award at the &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot; Computer Game Awards for 2000, which went to &quot;Sacrifice&quot;.

In 2003, writer Mark H. Walker reported that the game &quot;didn&#x27;t sell&quot;. He placed its sales at &quot;a few tens of thousands of copies&quot;.

==Legacy==
Following its release in 2000, Sierra announced in August of that same year, that an expansion pack called &quot;Ground Control: Dark Conspiracy&quot;, was being developed by both Massive Entertainment and High Voltage Software, which was released a few months later in October. The expansion continued the original storyline by focusing on Sarah Parker in the aftermath of the conflict, introducing a brand new campaign of 15 new missions and a new faction called the Phoenix Mercenaries who came with unique units and specialised in using incendiary-based weaponry and abilities. In addition, it also included some new units to existing factions, additional terrain types, new multiplayer maps, and fully rendered cutscenes that didn&#x27;t use the in-game engine. The following year, both the expansion and the main game were bundled together in a pack, entitled Ground Control Anthology.

In 2004, a sequel titled &quot;Ground Control II: Operation Exodus&quot; was developed by Massive and released by Vivendi. While the sequel featured improvements and updates to the game&#x27;s graphical engine and story, it also brought about faster-paced game mechanics that were more in line with contemporary real-time strategy games. In addition, a new game mechanic was introduced in the form of an economy system tied which gave players points to spend on fielding new unit and calling in support weapons for one of the game&#x27;s factions, when destroying enemies and gaining control of control points, another game mechanic that was also introduced. Prior to its release, Vivendi released &quot;Ground Control&quot; to the public as freeware, as a promotion for the sequel&#x27;s release.

In 2008, Vivendi retained ownership of the &quot;Ground Control&quot; franchise, shortly after its merger with Activision Blizzard led to Massive Entertainment being sold to Ubisoft in November, until July 2009 when they sold the franchise over to Rebellion Developments who revealed the plans to release a new game for the series, although no official news since then has confirmed that a sequel is being developed.

In 2009, both &quot;Ground Control Anthology&quot; and &quot;Ground Control II&quot; were re-released by the digital distributor GOG.com, while Rebellion re-released both titles onto Steam in 2015.

<text>Deidra Muriel Roper (born August 3, 1970), known professionally as DJ Spinderella or simply Spinderella, is an American DJ, rapper and producer. She is best known as a member of the hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa. Roper occasionally appeared in &quot;The Salt-n-Pepa Show&quot;, a reality TV series focusing on reforming the group, which aired on the VH1 network in 2008.

== Early life ==
Deidra Muriel Roper was born August 3, 1970, and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, as one of five children. Her early influence in music began as a child, fascinated by her father&#x27;s record collection growing up. Roper began her career as a DJ at age 14. During her sophomore year in high school, she began dating a local DJ who she learned DJ techniques from. Shortly thereafter, she began marketing herself as a DJ in the area around Brooklyn. At age 16, Roper was approached in school by a classmate who asked her would she be interested in joining an all-female rap group. The classmate knew Hurby &quot;LuvBug&quot; Azor, the producer of the group, and arranged for Roper to audition for him.

Roper was introduced to Salt-N-Pepa producer Hurby Azor just before the group was due to appear at the Westchester Music Festival in 1986. The group&#x27;s original DJ, Latoya Hanson, had missed several rehearsals and group appearances, and the group was looking for a replacement. Future radio and TV personality Wendy Williams had also auditioned as the DJ. Roper was selected as the group&#x27;s DJ by Azor (taking the name Spinderella) around the time the group&#x27;s first album was being released. Since she was 16 at the time of joining, her parents had to give permission for her to travel around the country. The trio became one of the most successful female hip-hop acts of all time. They released five studio albums and saw several platinum and gold singles, with Spinderella producing several songs on the group&#x27;s albums as well. In 1992, Spinderella appeared in the film &quot;Stay Tuned&quot;. In 1993, she was featured as a rapper on Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s album &quot;Looks Like a Job For...&quot; on the second single, &quot;Very Special&quot;, which would go on to become Big Daddy Kane&#x27;s only top 40 hit. In 1996, Spinderella appeared in the film &quot;Kazaam&quot;, which starred Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. She opened her own beauty salon on October 21, 1997, the same day that Salt-N-Pepa released their final album &quot;Brand New&quot;. After this album, Spinderella made plans to release a solo album, which never materialized as Red Ant, the group&#x27;s record label, ceased operations. Salt-N-Pepa disbanded in 2002, and reformed in 2007, eventually firing Spinderella in 2019.

From 2003 to 2006, Spinderella worked as a radio personality on the now-defunct KKBT 100.3 in Los Angeles, co-hosting &quot;The BackSpin&quot;, a nationally syndicated weekly radio show featuring old school hip-hop. She appeared in several episodes of the VH1 series &quot;The Salt N Pepa Show&quot;. From September 2010 to March 2011, she did mid-days at KSOC-94.5 &quot;K-Soul&quot; in Dallas, Texas. Spinderella is part of the American Diabetes Association Celebrity Cabinet, a TV ONE UnSung Ambassador, supporter of Saving Our Daughters Mentoring Program, and founder of the Spinderella DJ Academy. She appeared briefly on VH1&#x27;s first annual &quot;Hip Hop Honors&quot; in November 2004, with her group members, but they did not perform. All three members performed on the second &quot;Hip Hop Honors&quot; on September 22, 2005. This was the trio&#x27;s first performance as Salt-N-Pepa since 1999. In 2007, she acted as DJ for The Comedy Central Roast of Flavor Flav. In October 2008, the group performed their hit singles &quot;Shoop&quot;, &quot;Push It&quot;, and &quot;Whatta Man&quot; at the 2008 BET Hip Hop Awards. When the group appeared on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; to perform &quot;Push It&quot; on December 18, 2015, host Wendy Williams tried her hand at DJ&#x27;ing before Spinderella came out to continue in the role. On May 3, 2019, Spinderella announced in an Instagram post that she had been &quot;terminated&quot; from Salt-N-Pepa as of January 2019, and had broken her silence after the band hadn&#x27;t made a public announcement regarding their parting of ways.

== Personal life ==
In 1992, Roper had her first and only child, a daughter named Christy, with NBA player Kenny Anderson. Christy later appeared on an episode of &quot;My Super Sweet 16&quot;. In May 2021, Roper married her long time boyfriend, Quenton &quot;Q&quot; Coleman, who is a comedian.

<text>Allelopathy is a biological phenomenon by which an organism produces one or more biochemicals that influence the germination, growth, survival, and reproduction of other organisms. These biochemicals are known as allelochemicals and can have beneficial (positive allelopathy) or detrimental (negative allelopathy) effects on the target organisms and the community. Allelopathy is often used narrowly to describe chemically-mediated competition between plants; however, it is sometimes defined more broadly as chemically-mediated competition between any type of organisms. The original concept developed by Hans Molisch in 1937 seemed focused only on interactions between plants, between microorganisms and between microorganisms and plants. Allelochemicals are a subset of secondary metabolites, which are not directly required for metabolism (i.e. growth, development and reproduction) of the allelopathic organism. 

Allelopathic interactions are an important factor in determining species distribution and abundance within plant communities, and are also thought to be important in the success of many invasive plants. For specific examples, see black walnut (&quot;Juglans nigra)&quot;, tree of heaven (&quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;), black crowberry (&quot;Empetrum nigrum&quot;), spotted knapweed (&quot;Centaurea stoebe&quot;), garlic mustard (&quot;Alliaria petiolata&quot;), &quot;Casuarina/Allocasuarina spp.&quot;, and nutsedge.

It can often be difficult in practice to distinguish allelopathy from resource competition. While the former is caused by the addition of a harmful chemical agent to the environment, the latter is caused by the removal of essential resources (nutrients, light, water, etc.). Often, both mechanisms can act simultaneously. Moreover, some allelochemicals may function by reducing nutrient availability. Further confounding the issue, the production of allelochemicals can itself be affected by environmental factors such as nutrient availability, temperature and pH. Today, most ecologists recognize the existence of allelopathy, however many particular cases remain controversial. Furthermore, the specific modes of action of allelochemicals on different organisms are largely open to speculation and investigation. 

==History==
The term allelopathy from the Greek-derived compounds &quot;-&quot; () and &quot;-&quot; () (meaning &quot;mutual harm&quot; or &quot;suffering&quot;), was first used in 1937 by the Austrian professor Hans Molisch in the book &quot;Der Einfluss einer Pflanze auf die andere - Allelopathie&quot; (The Effect of Plants on Each Other - Allelopathy) published in German. He used the term to describe biochemical interactions by means of which a plant inhibits the growth of neighbouring plants. In 1971, Whittaker and Feeny published a review in the journal &quot;Science&quot;, which proposed an expanded definition of allelochemical interactions that would incorporate all chemical interactions among organisms. In 1984, Elroy Leon Rice in his monograph on allelopathy enlarged the definition to include all direct positive or negative effects of a plant on another plant or on micro-organisms by the liberation of biochemicals into the natural environment. Over the next ten years, the term was used by other researchers to describe broader chemical interactions between organisms, and by 1996 the International Allelopathy Society (IAS) defined allelopathy as &quot;Any process involving secondary metabolites produced by plants, algae, bacteria and fungi that influences the growth and development of agriculture and biological systems.&quot; In more recent times, plant researchers have begun to switch back to the original definition of substances that are produced by one plant that inhibit another plant. Confusing the issue more, zoologists have borrowed the term to describe chemical interactions between invertebrates like corals and sponges.

Long before the term allelopathy was used, people observed the negative effects that one plant could have on another. Theophrastus, who lived around 300 BC noticed the inhibitory effects of pigweed on alfalfa. In China around the first century CE, the author of &quot;Shennong Ben Cao Jing&quot;, a book on agriculture and medicinal plants, described 267 plants that had pesticidal abilities, including those with allelopathic effects. In 1832, the Swiss botanist De Candolle suggested that crop plant exudates were responsible for an agriculture problem called soil sickness.

Allelopathy is not universally accepted among ecologists. Many have argued that its effects cannot be distinguished from the exploitation competition that occurs when two (or more) organisms attempt to use the same limited resource, to the detriment of one or both. In the 1970s, great effort went into distinguishing competitive and allelopathic effects by some researchers, while in the 1990s others argued that the effects were often interdependent and could not readily be distinguished. However, by 1994, D. L. Liu and J. V. Lowett at the Department of Agronomy and Soil Science, University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, Australia, wrote two papers in the &quot;Journal of Chemical Ecology&quot; that developed methods to separate the allelochemical effects from other competitive effects, using barley plants and inventing a process to examine the allelochemicals directly. In 1994, M.C. Nilsson at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Umeå showed in a field study that allelopathy exerted by &quot;Empetrum hermaphroditum&quot; reduced growth of Scots pine seedlings by ~ 40%, and that below-ground resource competition by &quot;E. hermaphroditum&quot; accounted for the remaining growth reduction. For this work she inserted PVC-tubes into the ground to reduce below-ground competition or added charcoal to soil surface to reduce the impact of allelopathy, as well as a treatment combining the two methods. However, the use of activated carbon to make inferences about allelopathy has itself been criticized because of the potential for the charcoal to directly affect plant growth by altering nutrient availability.

Some high profile work on allelopathy has been mired in controversy. For example, the discovery that (−)-catechin was purportedly responsible for the allelopathic effects of the invasive weed &quot;Centaurea stoebe&quot; was greeted with much fanfare after being published in &quot;Science&quot; in 2003. One scientist, Dr. Alastair Fitter, was quoted as saying that this study was &quot;so convincing that it will &#x27;now place allelopathy firmly back on center stage.&#x27;&quot; However, many of the key papers associated with these findings were later retracted or majorly corrected, after it was found that they contained fabricated data showing unnaturally high levels of catechin in soils surrounding &quot;C. stoebe&quot;. Subsequent studies from the original lab have not been able to replicate the results from these retracted studies, nor have most independent studies conducted in other laboratories. Thus, it is doubtful whether the levels of (−)-catechin found in soils are high enough to affect competition with neighboring plants. The proposed mechanism of action (acidification of the cytoplasm through oxidative damage) has also been criticized, on the basis that (−)-catechin is actually an antioxidant.

==Examples==

===Plants===
Many invasive plant species interfere with native plants through allelopathy. A famous case of purported allelopathy is in desert shrubs. One of the most widely known early examples was &quot;Salvia leucophylla&quot;, because it was on the cover of the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 1964. Bare zones around the shrubs were hypothesized to be caused by volatile terpenes emitted by the shrubs. However, like many allelopathy studies, it was based on artificial lab experiments and unwarranted extrapolations to natural ecosystems. In 1970, &quot;Science&quot; published a study where caging the shrubs to exclude rodents and birds allowed grass to grow in the bare zones.
A detailed history of this story can be found in Halsey 2004.

Garlic mustard is another invasive plant species that may owe its success partly to allelopathy. Its success in North American temperate forests may be partly due to its excretion of glucosinolates like sinigrin that can interfere with mutualisms between native tree roots and their mycorrhizal fungi.

Allelopathy has been shown to play a crucial role in forests, influencing the composition of the vegetation growth, and also provides an explanation for the patterns of forest regeneration. The black walnut &quot;(Juglans nigra)&quot; produces the allelochemical juglone, which affects some species greatly while others not at all. However, most of the evidence for allelopathic effects of juglone come from laboratory assays and it thus remains controversial to what extent juglone affects the growth of competitors under field conditions. The leaf litter and root exudates of some &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species are allelopathic for certain soil microbes and plant species. The tree of heaven, &quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;, produces allelochemicals in its roots that inhibit the growth of many plants. Spotted knapweed (&quot;Centaurea&quot;) is considered an invasive plant that also utilizes allelopathy.

Another example of allelopathy is seen in &quot;Leucaena leucocephala&quot;, known as the miracle tree. This plant contains toxic amino acids that inhibit other plants’ growth but not its own species growth. Different crops react differently to these allelochemicals, so wheat yield decreases, while rice increases in the presence of &quot;L. leucocephala&quot;.

Capsaicin is an allelochemical found in many peppers that are cultivated by humans as a spice/food source. It is considered an allelochemical because it is not required for plant growth and survival, but instead deters herbivores and prevents other plants from sprouting in its immediate vicinity. Among the plants it has been studied on are grasses, lettuce, and alfalfa, and on average, it will inhibit the growth of these plants by about 50%. Capsaicin has been shown to deter both herbivores and certain parasites’ performance. Herbivores such as caterpillars show decreased development when fed a diet high in capsaicin.

=== Applications ===

Allelochemicals are a useful tool in sustainable farming due to their ability to control weeds. The possible application of allelopathy in agriculture is the subject of much research. Using allelochemical producing plants in agriculture results in significant suppression of weeds and various pests. Some plants will even reduce the germination rate of other plants by 50%. Current research is focused on the effects of weeds on crops, crops on weeds, and crops on crops. This research furthers the possibility of using allelochemicals as growth regulators and natural herbicides, to promote sustainable agriculture. Agricultural practices may be enhanced through the utilization of allelochemical producing plants. When used correctly, these plants can provide pesticide, herbicide, and antimicrobial qualities to crops. number of such allelochemicals are commercially available or in the process of large-scale manufacture. For example, leptospermone is an allelochemical in lemon bottlebrush (&quot;Callistemon citrinus&quot;). Although it was found to be too weak as a commercial herbicide, a chemical analog of it, mesotrione (tradename Callisto), was found to be effective. It is sold to control broadleaf weeds in corn but also seems to be an effective control for crabgrass in lawns. Sheeja (1993) reported the allelopathic interaction of the weeds &quot;Chromolaena odorata&quot; (&quot;Eupatorium odoratum&quot;) and &quot;Lantana camara&quot; on selected major crops.

Many crop cultivars show strong allelopathic properties, of which rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) has been most studied. Rice allelopathy depends on variety and origin: Japonica rice is more allelopathic than Indica and Japonica-Indica hybrid. More recently, critical review on rice allelopathy and the possibility for weed management reported that allelopathic characteristics in rice are quantitatively inherited and several allelopathy-involved traits have been identified. The use of allelochemicals in agriculture provide for a more environmentally friendly approach to weed control, as they do not leave behind residues. Currently used pesticides and herbicides leak into waterways and result in unsafe water qualities. This problem could be eliminated or significantly reduced by using allelochemicals instead of harsh herbicides. The use of cover crops also results in less soil erosion and lessens the need for nitrogen heavy fertilizers.

<text>The National Labor Union (NLU) was the first national labor federation in the United States. Founded in 1866 and dissolved in 1873, it paved the way for other organizations, such as the Knights of Labor and the AFL (American Federation of Labor). It was led by William H. Sylvis and Andrew Cameron.

==Organizational history==
The National Labor Union (NLU) followed the unsuccessful efforts of labor activists to form a national coalition of local trade unions. The NLU sought instead to bring together all of the national labor organizations in existence, as well as the &quot;eight-hour leagues&quot; established to press for the eight-hour day, to create a national federation that could press for labor reforms and help found national unions in those areas where none existed. The new organization favored arbitration over strikes and called for the creation of a national labor party as an alternative to the two existing parties.

The NLU drew much of its support from construction unions and other groups of skilled employees but also invited the unskilled and farmers to join. On the other hand, it campaigned for the exclusion of Chinese workers from the United States and made only halting, ineffective efforts to defend the rights of women and Black people. African-American workers established their own Colored National Labor Union as an adjunct, but their support of the prevalent racism of the citizens of the United States limited its effectiveness.

The NLU achieved early success, but one that proved less significant in practice. In 1868, Congress passed the statute for which the Union had campaigned so hard, providing the eight-hour day for government workers. Many government agencies, however, reduced wages at the same time that they reduced hours. While President Grant ordered federal departments not to reduce wages, his order was ignored by many. The NLU also obtained similar legislation in a number of states, such as New York and California, but discovered that loopholes in the statute made them unenforceable or ineffective.

In early 1869, the Chicago Tribune boasted that the NLU had 800,000 members; Sylvis himself put the figure at only 600,000. Both of these figures turned out to be greatly exaggerated. The organization was spectacularly unsuccessful at the polls and lost virtually all of its union supporters, many of whom moved on to the newly formed Knights of Labor. The depression of the 1870s, which drove down union membership generally, was one of the final factors contributing to the end of the NLU, the other being the dismantling of policies instituted during Radical Reconstruction.

== National Labor Reform Party ==

By the 1870s the organisation increasingly relied on political action to meet its goals and in 1872 transformed itself into the National Labor Reform Party. 

The NLRP nominated David Davis of Illinois, associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, as its presidential candidate for the upcoming presidential election. Davis later, however, withdrew his candidacy and the party made a poor showing at the polls. After holding one last convention in 1873, the National Labor Union collapsed and dissolved.

<doc id="632037" wikidata="Q7439349" url="?curid=632037" title="Scrumpy and Western">
<text>[[Fred Wedlock]] 
Scrumpy and Western refers humorously to music from England&#x27;s West Country that fuses comical folk-style songs, often full of double entendre, with affectionate parodies of more mainstream musical genres, all delivered in the local accent/dialect. The name, taken from the title of the 1967 &quot;Scrumpy &amp; Western EP&quot; by Adge Cutler and the Wurzels, refers to scrumpy, strongly alcoholic cider produced in the West Country; it is a play on the American genre of country and western music.

Styles vary by band or musician, and very few are known outside their native county. The main exceptions to this are the Wurzels (originally &quot;Adge Cutler and the Wurzels&quot;), a Somerset group who had a number one hit in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;The Combine Harvester&quot; in 1976. This followed an earlier UK hit single with &quot;Drink Up Thy Zider&quot;, an unofficial West Country anthem, especially among supporters of Bristol City Football Club. This gained notoriety when the BBC refused to play its B-side song, &quot;Twice Daily&quot;, due to concern about the unseemly subject matter (a shotgun wedding). &quot;Combine Harvester&quot; itself was a reworded version of Melanie&#x27;s &quot;Brand New Key&quot;. Other songs borrowed the style and made fun of the themes of Country and Western, and other US and British popular music.

Other artists whose music is Scrumpy and Western in flavour include The Yetties from the village of Yetminster in Dorset, The Golden Lion Light Orchestra from Worcestershire, Fred Wedlock, Who&#x27;s Afear&#x27;d (also from Dorset), the Skimmity Hitchers (a group that includes former members of Who&#x27;s Afear&#x27;d), the Surfin Turnips (more punky folk), Trevor Crozier, the Yokels (from Wiltshire), Shag Connors and the Carrot Crunchers, and the Pigsty Hill Light Orchestra.

<doc id="632053" wikidata="Q5046735" url="?curid=632053" title="Carrs-Safeway">
<text>Carrs–Safeway (formerly Carrs Quality Centers) is a supermarket chain that is based in Anchorage, Alaska, and is a subsidiary of Albertsons. It was acquired in April 1999 by former parent Safeway from an employee ownership group, who itself had purchased the company from founder Larry Carr and his partner Barney Gottstein in 1990.

The proposed acquisition led to an antitrust lawsuit filed by the Alaska Public Interest Research Group, which was resolved by a consent decree reached between Safeway and the Alaska Attorney General&#x27;s office which required the company to divest seven stores. Those stores re-opened as the grocery chain Alaska Marketplace, which closed at the end of 2000. One of those stores, the Foodland Shopping Circle in Fairbanks, one of the earliest stores in the Carrs chain, has remained largely vacant since.

As of 2010, there are 24 stores in Alaska, including: Anchorage, Fairbanks (both in multiple locations), Juneau, Kenai, Homer, Ketchikan, Kodiak, Nome, North Pole, Palmer, Seward, Soldotna, Valdez, Wasilla and Unalaska.

==History==

===Beginning===
Laurence John &quot;Larry&quot; Carr (July 28, 1929 – May 12, 2011) moved to Anchorage, Alaska, in 1947 after graduating from high school in San Bernardino, California. After a short stint in management at the Alaska Railroad commissary, in which he hoped to make enough money to return to California and open a grocery store there, he instead became a competitor in the grocery business in Anchorage.

Carr opened his first store in a Quonset hut, located on the southern end of Gambell Street in the Eastchester (now known as Fairview) neighborhood of Anchorage, in February 1950. The location would prove to be beneficial, as Gambell Street, which became Potter Road after leaving the townsite limits and dead-ended several miles south of town at a railroad section house, soon became the northern terminus of the Seward Highway.

The name Carrs was derived from the original operating partnership of Larry Carr and his brother, Bernard Joseph Carr, Jr. They were joined by their father, Bernard Joseph &quot;Pop&quot; Carr, following his retirement from the Santa Fe Railroad in 1954. The senior Carr left the company in 1964 to launch a successful campaign for the Alaska House of Representatives.

Another person involved in the company during its early days was Bernard J. &quot;Barney&quot; Gottstein. His father, Jacob B. Gottstein, started a wholesale grocery business in Anchorage when the town was founded in 1915. Carr and Gottstein began their formal business partnership in 1960, integrating retail and wholesale grocery operations and real estate development (particularly construction of shopping centers) into one company. Carr and Gottstein were also heavily involved during the 1960s in promoting the business and political career of a recent young arrival to Alaska named Mike Gravel.

===1960s–1980s===
The second Carrs location and associated construction, the Aurora Village Shopping Center, was built in 1966. The Mall at Sears, an enclosed mall with an interior motif resembling a downtown sidewalk, was built the following year. Both were built along Northern Lights Boulevard, which being a section line arterial, was mostly known for illegal drag racing and associated businesses such as drive-in restaurants, as the vast majority of Anchorage&#x27;s retail landscape was located downtown at the time. The construction of these two malls, combined with the Northern Lights Center constructed by Wally Hickel in 1960, started the shift in customer traffic away from downtown and towards the outlying areas of Anchorage.

These two malls began a pattern of Carrs Grocery and strip mall construction which followed for most of the next two decades. By the mid-1970s, there were Carrs stores throughout southcentral Alaska, as well as the Foodland Shopping Circle in downtown Fairbanks. Carrs operated a warehouse market called Prairie Market in the 1970s and 1980s, with two locations close to the Old Seward Highway in Anchorage.

===1990s===
Carrs stores were primarily located throughout the &quot;Railbelt&quot; area of Alaska. A subsidiary, Eagle Quality Centers, operated in numerous mid-sized and smaller Alaskan communities, both within and outside of the Railbelt. The company branched out into Southeast Alaska in the early 1990s, opening stores in Juneau and Ketchikan.

Carr and Gottstein sold their business in a leveraged buyout to two senior executives of Carr-Gottstein: John Cairns, the company&#x27;s general manager, and Mark Williams, Carr-Gottstein&#x27;s vice-president of operations. The price was 250–300 million dollars for 13 Carrs Quality Centers, 15 Oaken Keg liquor stores, 3 Eagle Quality Centers, Gottstein wholesale food business, freight operations, and Carr-Gottstein Properties, a real estate development firm. The company purchased the Fairbanks supermarket chain Super Valu (formerly Market Basket) in 1992.

===Safeway merger===

In 1999, Safeway, Inc. acquired Carrs. Due to strong customer loyalty to the Carrs name, the chain was renamed Carrs-Safeway, and customers could opt to use a loyalty card.

===Aborted sale to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, LLC===

On September 8, 2023, Kroger and Albertsons announced plans to sell off the Carrs brand name, along with 14 stores, to C&amp;S Wholesale Grocers, as a condition of Kroger and Albertsons merger. In July 2024, an updated plan to divest 18 stores was announced. This included all 11 Carrs locations, the 2 Safeway locations in Fairbanks, the Safeway locations in North Pole, Soldotna, Kenai, and Juneau, and the Eagle location in Girdwood. However, on December 10, 2024, the Kroger-Albertsons merger was blocked by the Federal Trade Commission, aborting the sale of Carrs to C&amp;S.

==Fuel stations==
Carrs/Safeway customers receive fuel discounts when shopping at any participating Carrs/Safeway Store, They must use a Club Card in order to receive points that eventually over time can turn into a discount unless you spent $100 or over in a transaction.
A Customer earns points every dollar spent, spend $100 in one transaction and receive a discount for 10 Cents off a gallon up to 25 gallons, These discounts then can be racked up over time to save up to $1.00 off per gallon. 

Carrs/Safeway Fuel Rewards has been effective since mid 2011. Safeway adjusted the program in July 2012 for discounts and dropped the &quot;Always get 3 cents off per gallon&quot; discount as well as made the discount gallons drop from 30 gallons to 25 gallons; limiting customers on fuel.
Since 2007, they have operated the seven-store chain &quot;The Great Alaska Tobacco Co&quot; as stand alone stores it is a division of Carrs.

<text>Youth work is a community support activity aimed at older children and adolescents. Depending upon the culture and the community, different services and institutions may exist for this purpose. In general, it provides an environment where young people can engage in informal educational activities. Throughout the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada, youth work is &quot;to facilitate personal, educational, and social development.&quot; Through participative activities and coordinated programs, it seeks to enable young people in &quot;gaining a voice, influence, and place in society in a period of their transition from dependence to independence.&quot; By nature and design these activities would be inclusive, educative, and empowering, and based on partnership, equality of opportunity, and respecting diversity.

==Overview==
&quot;Youth work&quot; is defined as activities that intentionally seek to impact young people. This is primarily a set of loosely affiliated activities that have been defined, redefined, examined, and reinvented in subsequent generations. 

In Ireland the Youth Work Act of 2001 states that,

:&#x27;Youth work&#x27; means a planned programme of education designed for the purpose of aiding and enhancing the personal and social development of young persons through their voluntary participation, and which (a) complements their formal, academic, or vocational education and training; and (b) is provided primarily by voluntary youth work organisations.&quot;

However, critics of this particular definition report need for expansion of the limited view,

:&quot;Youth work should aim to engage with society and bring about social change in an unequal society.&quot;

Some critics report that youth work should seek youth participation in justice, equality, and youth empowerment through political engagement. They say youth should be liberated with orientation in critical analysis of local and global influences (globalization) in their lives and in their communities. Others like Julius Nyerere say education, the educative aspect of youth work should be a voluntary pursuit of the youth for it to be a tool of personal and social liberation.

Youth work is historically said to focus on five areas, including a focus on young people; an emphasis on voluntary participation and relationship; a commitment to association by youth and adults; friendly and informal atmospheres, and; acting with integrity.

==History==

Youth work often emphasises the need to involve young people in the running of their own services through a process of youth-led youth work. Historically there are a number of different motives for the development of youth work in the UK. First, early youth workers, often from the middle classes, frequently saw working with deserving young people as an expression of their Christian faith. Secondly there was a concern to instill a middle class set of values in working class youth.

This early approach to youth work has actually been around since the birth of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century, which was the first time that young men left their own homes and cottage industries to migrate to the big towns. The result of this migration was an emergent youth culture in urban areas, which locally was responded to by the efforts of local people. Although with the formation of the YMCA (and later Scouting) organisations were founded whose sole aim was to address these issues, the emphasis was always on providing for young people.

A government review of the Youth Service, set up in November 1958 and chaired by Lady Albemarle, was published in 1960. It argued cogently for specific kinds of provision to be provided by local councils and ushered in a significant building boom of new premises for youth work. Often thought of as a golden age, the period following the Albemarle report was a time of thriving centre-based youth work.

Today (as outlined in the &quot;Transforming Youth Work&quot; document released in 1998 by the DfES) it is the statutory duty of all local government organisations to provide a youth service in their region. Also for the first time the youth service has national targets that have to be met with regard to the reach (initial contact) with young people, the number of relationships developed with young people and the number of accredited learning programmes achieved through the youth service.

In 1999 in the UK the main national professional organisations and trades union (CYWU) agreed to join other professional bodies representing informal education practitioners (community workers, community based adult educators, community educators), to create a UK wide National Training Organisation called PAULO (named in honour of the educator Paulo Freire. PAULO was formally approved by the Government to set the occupational training standards for all people working in this employment sector. In 2002 PAULO formed part of the Lifelong Learning UK Sector Skills Council.

==Approaches==

===Community youth work===

Community youth workers provide community-based activities for young people in a variety of settings throughout local communities, including places of worship, nonprofit organizations and government agencies.

===Youth empowerment===

Youth empowerment is the deliberate granting of authority to young people by adults. This may take the form of youth leadership in program or organizational planning, research, design, facilitation or evaluation. This youth-centered approach has been shown to be particularly effective at promoting and sustaining youth engagement and for its efficacy across cultural, social and other boundaries.

Schemes associated with youth empowerment include programs various types of youth participation throughout organizations, governments and schools. This includes involving youth as planners, researchers, teachers, evaluators, decision-makers and advocates.

===Centre-based youth work===

This youth work is carried out at a dedicated premises, which may include facilities such as drop-in coffee bars, sports facilities and advice centres. Most youth clubs fall under this fairly wide category. It is reliant on young people choosing to come to the centre, but in some cases may be linked with outreach or school-based youth work.

===Faith-based youth work===
This youth work is carried out from a foundation of religious morals and may be for the purpose of sharing or engendering religious views. In the Christian church the main purpose of faith-based youth work may be derived from the biblical commandment to &quot;love your neighbour.&quot;
In many faith-based situations the main agenda or purpose of youth work is aligned with the spiritual goals of the religion, or the perceived progress of a young person toward these goals. In Northern Ireland, 64% of youth work is faith-based.

===Detached youth work===
In its purest form, detached youth work is a form of street-based youth work provision that operates without the use of a centre and takes place where young people &quot;are at&quot; both geographically and developmentally. It is often confused with outreach work because of the similar principles, i.e. making contact on the streets with those &quot;hard to reach&quot; or &quot;unattached&quot; young people. Detached work is seen as more than trying to encourage young people to utilise existing provision (which is the often used definition of Outreach work) and is used as a method of delivering informal and social education and is concerned with addressing whatever needs are presented to or perceived by the youth worker.

Also referred to as &quot;street work&quot; by some European, North and South American practitioners, modern detached work appears to have been influenced in Great Britain and Ireland by early contributions from the United States, and in particular, accounts of the work carried out by the Welfare Council of New York with street gangs in the 1950s became some of the earliest literature available on the subject of street-based work. Street work has, however, always, since its earliest incarnations, had a role to play in youth work.

However, it is important to note that contributors on the subject, such as those referenced above, e.g. (Kaufman, 2001) &amp; (Smith, 1996.) have discussed the ambiguity surrounding the titling of such forms of work and the regular confusion around which form of work is which and indeed as Smith himself states 
&quot;There has been a good deal of dispute over how to label the work described here. The problem with notions such as &#x27;detached&#x27; is that it could still be seen as making the youth centre or traditional youth organization the basic reference point. (These are what the workers are detached from). Furthermore, the titling adds to the stereotypical view of detached workers as &#x27;mavericks&#x27; who float free of attachment. The reality of practice is that a central feature of the work is the process of becoming attached - to a neighbourhood, groups of young people, local community members and so on. To this can be added the pretty pointless debate between &#x27;detached&#x27; and &#x27;outreach&#x27; work. The latter, it is sometimes said, is mainly concerned with bringing people into existing organizations and activities; the former is about &#x27;working with people where they are at&#x27;. In reality most &#x27;detached&#x27; workers have to use existing organizations, and have a range of activities that people can plug into. Some care is needed around this area...Most detached workers have some sort of office and base (with group rooms etc.) Furthermore their contact making may well be &#x27;off the street&#x27; in schools, various commercial leisure environments, and in people&#x27;s homes&quot;.

Reproduced from the encyclopaedia of informal education http://www.infed.org
Adding to this debate is the fact that while there exists much support for street-based provision there is few definitions in existence to clearly distinguish the differences (if any) between &#x27;Outreach&#x27; and &#x27;Detached&#x27; work. That said, the Scottish Executive in 1998 commissioned The Princes Trust to carry out a National Development Project to develop Best Practice guidelines and methods to monitor, evaluate and create a National focus for Outreach and Detached Youth Work. Through their research they offered this clear and simple definition for detached work, that is adequate for all those who are unfamiliar with this type of youth work provision,

&quot;Detached youth work is a model of youth work practice, targeted at vulnerable young people, which takes place on young people’s own territory such as streets, cafes, parks and pubs at times that are appropriate to them and on their terms. It begins from where young people are in terms of their values, attitudes, issues and ambitions and is concerned with their personal and social development. It is characterised by purposeful interaction between youth workers and young people and utilises a range of youth and community work methods&quot;.

===Outreach youth work===

Similar to detached youth work, outreach is a form of youth work that takes place on young people’s own territory and is a method of work that supports and compliments new and existing centre/project based youth work. Primarily used to inform young people of services that exist in their locality and to encourage them to use such services, Outreach can also seek to identify, through consultation with young people, any gaps that exist in services aimed at meeting their needs.As opposed to Detached Youth Work, Outreach is seen as an extension to centre-based work
, Outreach work takes place when workers who are usually centre based go onto the streets with an agenda of their own to pursue, usually to encourage young people to attend their club.

As highlighted above there are few definitions available to clearly distinguish the differences between Outreach and Detached work and according to The Princes Trust&#x27;s research for the Scottish Executive, the reason for this may be partly due to the similarities in the places where the work is carried out (on the streets, in parks and cafes) and the fact that both models work with the same target groups of young people (those who are disaffected or alienated). Furthermore, the research points out that &quot;There is even some evidence from fieldwork that there can be an occasional overlap in practice between the two modes of work. For these and other reasons, definitions have received less emphasis in the literature than the principles and intentions of each of these modes of work&quot;.

===School-based work===

This form of youth work is carried out in schools and is provided directly for the pupils, often by an organisation external from the school. It may include lessons, assemblies, after-school clubs, one to one mentoring etc. There may be a link with other non-school youth activities.

===Youth development===
Youth development programs seek to identify the needs of young people from a social/educational perspective, and to meet those needs through structured, intentional activities that satisfy those needs. This area includes community youth development and positive youth development activities.

==Youth worker==
Youth workers are people active in the field of youth work. The work includes orientation of young people to the adult world through socialisation, dismantling exclusion, and connecting them with resources needed for growth and development. Hence youth workers would hold different roles and use different set of skills and resources to attain youth work objectives. Different types of youth work is facilitated through centre-based work, detached work, school-based work, religion based work, etc.

<doc id="632064" wikidata="Q938207" url="?curid=632064" title="Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond">
<text>Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond, 1st Duke of Lennox (29 July 167227 May 1723), of Goodwood House near Chichester in Sussex, was the youngest of the seven illegitimate sons of King Charles II, and was that king&#x27;s only son by his French-born mistress Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth. He was appointed Hereditary Constable of Inverness Castle.

On his mother&#x27;s side, he was descended from the Seigneurs of the Château de Kéroual, a castle built in the 16th century in Kerouat-Bihan, Guilers, Finistère, Brittany, France, as well as the House of Plœuc and Kergorlay noble family of Brittany.

==Titles==
Various titles became eligible for re-grant following the death in 1672 of King Charles II&#x27;s childless 4th cousin (both being descended in the male line from John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox, the paternal grandfather of Henry Stewart, Lord Darnley, father of King James I of England) Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox (1639–1672), KG, 12th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny in France, of Cobham Hall in Kent and of Richmond House in Whitehall, London. 

This Anglicised branch of the Scottish family of &quot;Stewart of Darnley&quot; had been beloved by King James I &amp; VI, whose favourite had been the Franco-Scottish Esmé Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox, 1st Earl of Lennox (1542–1583), 7th Seigneur d&#x27;Aubigny, his father&#x27;s first cousin (and great-grandfather of the last in the male line Charles Stewart, 3rd Duke of Richmond, 6th Duke of Lennox). 

Thus, the Lennox and Richmond titles and the French Seigneurie d&#x27;Aubigny (effectively the lordship of the manor of the Château d&#x27;Aubigny in Aubigny-sur-Nère) held special significance for the Stuart monarchs. Moreover, the title Earl of Richmond had merged into the crown on the accession to the throne in 1485 of King Henry VII, formerly Earl of Richmond, and the Scottish title Earl of Lennox had merged into the crown of Great Britain, as King James I of England and VI of Scotland was effectively the 5th Earl of Lennox, being the heir of his paternal grandfather Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox.

On 9 August 1675, King Charles II&#x27;s illegitimate son (by Louise de Kérouaille) who had been given the surname &quot;Lennox&quot;, was created Duke of Richmond, Earl of March, and Baron Settrington in the Peerage of England; and on 9 September 1675, he was created Duke of Lennox, Earl of Darnley, and Baron Methuen of Torbolten in the Peerage of Scotland. He was invested as a Knight of the Garter on 18 April 1681. In 1684, at the request of King Charles II, the French King Louis XIV created Louise de Kérouaille &quot;Duchesse d&#x27;Aubigny&quot; in the Peerage of France, with remainder to her descendants. 

As the 1st Duke predeceased his mother, he never held the French dukedom, which was however inherited by his son, the duchess&#x27;s grandson. He was appointed Lord High Admiral of Scotland, under reservation of the commission granted to James, Duke of Albany and York (later James VII), as Lord High Admiral for life. The appointment was therefore only effective between 1701 and 1705, when Lennox resigned all of his Scottish lands and offices.

He was Master of a Lodge in Chichester in 1696, and so was one of the few known seventeenth-century freemasons. His son followed him into the Freemasons.

==Marriage and issue==
On 8 January 1692 he married Anne Brudenell (d. 9 December 1722), a daughter of Francis Brudenell, Lord Brudenell (d. 1698), eldest son and heir apparent of Robert Brudenell, 2nd Earl of Cardigan. By his wife he had issue one son and two daughters: 
*Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, 2nd Duke of Lennox, 2nd Duc d&#x27;Aubigny (1701–1750), son and heir, known during his father&#x27;s lifetime by the courtesy title of Earl of March; 
*Lady Louisa Lennox (Countess of Berkeley), who married James Berkeley, 3rd Earl of Berkeley; 
*Lady Anne Lennox (Countess of Albemarle), who married Willem van Keppel, 2nd Earl of Albemarle.

By his mistress Jacqueline de Mézières he had a daughter, Renée Lennox (1709–1774), mistress of her half-first-cousin Charles Beauclerk, 2nd Duke of St Albans, the son and heir of the sixth illegitimate son of King Charles II (by his mistress Nell Gwyn). 

==Patron of cricket==
He was a patron of the game of cricket, then becoming a leading professional sport, and did much to develop it in Sussex. It is almost certain that he was involved with the earliest known &quot;great match&quot;, which took place in the 1697 season and was the first to be reported by the press. The report was in the &quot;Foreign Post&quot; dated Wednesday, 7 July 1697:

&quot;The middle of last week a great match at cricket was played in Sussex; there were eleven of a side, and they played for fifty guineas apiece&quot;.

The stakes on offer confirm the importance of the fixture and the fact that it was eleven-a-side suggests that two strong and well-balanced teams were assembled. No other details were given but the report provides evidence that cricket, in the form of &quot;great matches&quot; played for high stakes, was in vogue at the time. It was possibly an inter-county match: i.e., a Sussex XI &quot;versus&quot; a Kent XI or a Surrey XI. Richmond sponsored a team in the 1702 season against an Arundel side. His son Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond inherited his interest in cricket and became the patron of both Sussex county cricket teams and Slindon Cricket Club.

==Death and burial==
He died on 27 May 1723 and was buried on 7 June 1723 in the &quot;Richmond Chapel&quot; (Henry VII Chapel) of Westminster Abbey, which chapel had been built by King Henry VII, formerly Earl of Richmond. His body was reinterred on 16 August 1750 in the Lady Chapel of Chichester Cathedral in Sussex.

==Legacy==
Richmond County, New York (coextensive with Staten Island), and Richmond County, Virginia, were named after Charles Lennox, whilst other US counties called &quot;Richmond&quot; were named after later Dukes.

Through his daughter, Anne, he is an ancestor of Queen Camilla of the United Kingdom and through both Anne and his elder son of the late Diana, Princess of Wales.

<text>A bootloader, also spelled as boot loader or called bootstrap loader, is a computer program that is responsible for booting a computer and booting an operating system. If it also provides an interactive menu with multiple boot choices then it&#x27;s often called a boot manager.

When a computer is turned off, its softwareincluding operating systems, application code, and dataremains stored on non-volatile memory. When the computer is powered on, it typically does not have an operating system or its loader in random-access memory (RAM). The computer first executes a relatively small program stored in the boot ROM, which is read-only memory (ROM, and later EEPROM, NOR flash) along with some needed data, to initialize hardware devices such as CPU, motherboard, memory, storage and other I/O devices, to access the nonvolatile device (usually block device, e.g., NAND flash) or devices from which the operating system programs and data can be loaded into RAM.

Some earlier computer systems, upon receiving a boot signal from a human operator or a peripheral device, may load a very small number of fixed instructions into memory at a specific location, initialize at least one CPU, and then point the CPU to the instructions and start their execution. These instructions typically start an input operation from some peripheral device (which may be switch-selectable by the operator). Other systems may send hardware commands directly to peripheral devices or I/O controllers that cause an extremely simple input operation (such as &quot;read sector zero of the system device into memory starting at location 1000&quot;) to be carried out, effectively loading a small number of boot loader instructions into memory; a completion signal from the I/O device may then be used to start execution of the instructions by the CPU.

Smaller computers often use less flexible but more automatic boot loader mechanisms to ensure that the computer starts quickly and with a predetermined software configuration. In many desktop computers, for example, the bootstrapping process begins with the CPU executing software contained in ROM (for example, the BIOS of an IBM PC or an IBM PC compatible) at a predefined address (some CPUs, including the Intel x86 series, are designed to execute this software after reset without outside help). This software contains rudimentary functionality to search for devices eligible to participate in booting, and load a small program from a special section (most commonly the boot sector) of the most promising device, typically starting at a fixed entry point such as the start of the sector.

== First-stage boot loader ==

Examples of first-stage bootloaders include BIOS, UEFI, coreboot, Libreboot, and Das U-Boot. It initialize hardware devices such as CPU, motherboard, memory, storage and other I/O devices.

== Second-stage boot loader ==

Second-stage boot loaders, such as GNU GRUB, rEFInd, BOOTMGR, Syslinux, and NTLDR, are not themselves operating systems, but are able to load an operating system properly and transfer execution to it; the operating system subsequently initializes itself and may load extra device drivers.

Second-stage implementations can include interactive user interfaces, allowing boot option selection and parameter modification. They handle kernel loading, including processing of initrd/initramfs images, and can pass boot parameters to the kernel. Many implement modular designs supporting loadable modules for additional functionality. These choices can include different operating systems (for dual or multi-booting from different partitions or drives), different versions of the same operating system (in case a new version has unexpected problems), different operating system loading options (e.g., booting into a rescue or safe mode), and some standalone programs that can function without an operating system, such as memory testers (e.g., memtest86+), a basic shell (as in GNU GRUB), or even games (see List of PC booter games). Some boot loaders can also load other boot loaders; for example, GRUB loads BOOTMGR instead of loading Windows directly. Usually, a default choice is preselected with a time delay during which a user can press a key to change the choice; after this delay, the default choice is automatically run so normal booting can occur without interaction.
They may also handle compression, cryptographic verification, and chain-loading of other bootloaders.
The boot process can be considered complete when the computer is ready to interact with the user, or the operating system is capable of running system programs or application programs.

== IBM-compatible personal computers ==
=== Legacy BIOS ===
In x86 computers, after the BIOS executes Power-On Self Test, then a first-stage bootloader is a compact 512-byte program that resides in the master boot record (MBR) is executed. Running in 16-bit real mode at address 0x7C00, it locates the second-stage bootloader. Its primary challenge lies in accomplishing these tasks within strict size constraints while handling potential hardware failures. The bootloader must navigate disk structures, often implementing FAT file system support, and manage the delicate transition from the BIOS startup state to a stable environment for the next boot stage.

First-stage MBR boot loaders may face peculiar constraints, especially in size; for instance, on the earlier IBM PC and compatibles, a boot sector should typically work with 510 bytes of code (or less) and in only 32 KiB (later relaxed to 64 KiB) of system memory and only use instructions supported by the original 8088/8086 processors. The first stage of PC boot loaders (FSBL, first-stage boot loader) located on fixed disks and removable drives must fit into the first 446 bytes of the master boot record in order to leave room for the default 64-byte partition table with four partition entries and the two-byte boot signature, which the BIOS requires for a proper boot loader — or even less, when additional features like more than four partition entries (up to 16 with 16 bytes each), a disk signature (6 bytes), a disk timestamp (6 bytes), an Advanced Active Partition (18 bytes) or special multi-boot loaders have to be supported as well in some environments.

In floppy and superfloppy volume boot records, up to 59 bytes are occupied for the extended BIOS parameter block (EBPB) on FAT12 and FAT16 volumes since DOS 4.0, whereas the FAT32 EBPB introduced with DOS 7.1 requires even 87 bytes, leaving only 423 bytes for the boot loader when assuming a sector size of 512 bytes. Microsoft boot sectors, therefore, traditionally imposed certain restrictions on the boot process. For example, the boot file had to be located at a fixed position in the root directory of the file system and stored within consecutive sectors, conditions taken care of by the codice_1 command and slightly relaxed in later versions of DOS. The boot loader was then able to load the first three sectors of the file into memory, which happened to contain another embedded boot loader able to load the remainder of the file into memory. When Microsoft added logical block addressing (LBA) and FAT32 support, they switched to a boot loader reaching over &quot;two&quot; physical sectors, using 386 instructions for size reasons. At the same time, other vendors managed to squeeze much more functionality into a single boot sector without relaxing the original constraints on only minimal available memory (32 KiB) and processor support (8088/8086). For example, DR-DOS boot sectors are able to locate the boot file in the FAT12, FAT16 and FAT32 file systems, and load it into memory as a whole via CHS or LBA, even if the file is not stored in a fixed location and in consecutive sectors.

In x86 computers, second-stage bootloaders, such as PBR, operate without the strict 512-byte limitation of their first-stage counterparts. They execute in a more sophisticated environment, typically ranging from 8KB to several megabytes in size. This expanded space allows implementation of complex features such as filesystem support, runtime configuration, and bootloader menu interfaces. The second-stage boot loader does not need drivers for its own operation, but may instead use generic storage access methods provided by system firmware such as the BIOS, though typically with restricted hardware functionality and lower performance.

In x86 computers, third-stage bootloaders are include IO.SYS, NTLDR, BOOTMGR and GRUB.

=== UEFI ===
UEFI (except for CSM boot) does not rely on boot sectors, it loads next-stage bootloader (such as BOOTMGR and GRUB2) from EFI System Partition directly.

== Embedded and multi-stage boot loaders ==
Many embedded systems must boot immediately. For example, waiting a minute for a digital television or a GPS navigation device to start is generally unacceptable. Therefore, such devices have software systems in ROM or flash memory so the device can begin functioning immediately; little or no loading is necessary, because the loading can be precomputed and stored on the ROM when the device is made.

Large and complex systems may have boot procedures that proceed in multiple phases until finally the operating system and other programs are loaded and ready to execute. Because operating systems are designed as if they never start or stop, a boot loader might load the operating system, configure itself as a mere process within that system, and then irrevocably transfer control to the operating system. The boot loader then terminates normally as any other process would.

More preciously, a bootloader is used to boot an operating system. Early devices, such as TVs and DVD players in 2000s, may not offer the operating system and may not offer the bootloader, but they usually offer the proprietary firmware.

== Network booting ==
Most computers are also capable of booting over a computer network. In this scenario, the operating system is stored on the disk of a server, and certain parts of it are transferred to the client using a simple protocol such as the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP). After these parts have been transferred, the operating system takes over the control of the booting process.

As with the second-stage boot loader, network booting begins by using generic network access methods provided by the network interface&#x27;s boot ROM, which typically contains a Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) image. No drivers are required, but the system functionality is limited until the operating system kernel and drivers are transferred and started. As a result, once the ROM-based booting has completed it is entirely possible to network boot into an operating system that itself does not have the ability to use the network interface.

<text>An L-plate is a square plate bearing a sans-serif letter L, for &quot;learner&quot;, which must be affixed to the front and/or back of a vehicle in many countries if its driver is a learner under instruction, or a motorcycle rider with provisional entitlement to ride restricted motorcycles.

== Newly licensed drivers ==

===Australia===

In Australia the rules vary from state to state. A new driver holds a Learner licence/permit which has a minimum age of 16, or 15 and 9 months in some areas. This must then be held for a certain amount of time before a driving examination can be undertaken, usually 12 months later. After passing, the driver must display &#x27;P&#x27; plates. Holders of a provisional/probationary licence may be restricted compared to fully licensed drivers in speed, blood alcohol limits, limits on the type and power of their car&#x27;s engine (i.e., no more than 6 cylinders, no forced induction, kW per ton limits), and number of demerit points that can be accrued. VicRoads, the Victorian road authority, publish information for learner drivers on the L-Site.

Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) first commenced in Australia in the mid-1960s with New South Wales introducing learner and provisional licences on January 4, 1966. In all states, newly licensed drivers are required by law to display P-plates for varying lengths of time. The P is usually a red or green letter on a white background or a white letter on a red or green background (Victoria and Western Australia only). In New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria there are two classes of provisional/probationary licence: red P-plates are for the first year after passing the Learner test, and then after passing a computerised test they are green for two to three years. Western Australia requires six months of red P-plates, where provisional drivers are under a 12midnight–5am curfew, and one and a half years of green P-plates.

On 1 July 2000, New South Wales introduced a three-stage Graduated Licensing Scheme (GLS):
# Stage one is a learner licence with the requirement to complete 120 hours of supervised driving, including 20 hours of nighttime driving. A learner licence must be held for a minimum of 12 months before a practical driving test can be taken in order to proceed to a P1 probationary licence.
# Stage two is a one-year P1 probationary licence (with red P plates).
# Stage three is a two-year P2 probationary licence (with green P plates).

On 1 July 2008, Victoria introduced the Graduated Licensing Systems (GLS).
# Stage one is a one-year P1 probationary licence (with red P plates).
# Stage two is a three-year P2 probationary licence (with green P plates).
# P1 drivers are prohibited from using a mobile phone of any kind.
# P1 drivers are banned from towing, except for work or when supervised.
# P1 drivers can carry no more than one passenger aged between 16 years of age and less than 22 years, unless the passengers are immediate family members.
# A good driving record will be necessary to progress to the next licence stage.

As of July 2007, newly issued Queensland drivers licences have new restrictions for those under 25 years of age. Learners must first log 100 hours of driving experience (of which 10 must be undertaken at night) before taking their practical driving examination. Learners can boost this experience by taking professional lessons, which counts for 3 times the hours, for up to 10 hours (or 30 logbook hours.) After a period of one year, provisional drivers must then pass a hazard-perception test to move from red to green P-Plates, where previously only a 3-year duration was required. New restrictions also prevent any under-25, Queensland provisional licence-holder from carrying more than one passenger under the age of 21 who is not an immediate family member, between the hours of 11pm and 5am.

==== Speed limits ====
L-platers and provisional drivers (P-platers) are restricted in some states to lower speeds.

* Northern Territory L-platers are restricted to a maximum speed of ;
* New South Wales L-platers, P1 drivers and Tasmanian L-platers are restricted to ;
* South Australian L and P-platers (both P1 and P2), New South Wales P2 drivers, Northern Territory P-platers and Western Australian L-platers are restricted to ;
* Queensland, Victoria, and the ACT make no speed restrictions beyond the speed limits applicable to all drivers. WA P-platers and Tasmanian P2 drivers may also drive to the posted speed limit.

===Canada===
Motor vehicles are provincially regulated in Canada, and so regulations vary by province. In British Columbia, following the instructional phase and after passing a road test, new drivers are required to show a green N (for novice) plate until they have passed an additional road test, usually after 24 months.

In British Columbia, a red L (for learner) plate is required for 12 months before the N can be issued, and new drivers with this marking are not permitted to drive without a licensed driver over the age of 25 present in the vehicle.

===France===
After learners pass their driving test, they must display a A-plate (for ), of round shape with white background and red letter, for three years (shortened to two years for those who took part in the program – a program allowing learner to drive with a licensed driver in the passenger seat and starting three years before the minimum driving age).
They must follow a different speed limit: on highways (instead of ), on national roads with road dividers (instead of ) and on every road normally limited to .

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, a person is allowed to apply for a learners&#x27; licence for private cars, light good vehicles, motorcycles and motor tricycles once he or she has reached 18 years old. For learners&#x27; licence of other vehicle classes, applicants must be over 21 years old and hold a valid full driving licence or a probationary driving license for one year. Holders of a learners&#x27; licence in Hong Kong must be accompanied by a licensed driving instructor (except for people driving motorcycles and motor tricycles) and must display L-plates at front and rear of the vehicle while driving. The L-plate is printed red on a white background with an alphabet &quot;L&quot; and a Chinese character &quot;學&quot;, which literally means &quot;learning&quot;.

A one-year probationary period has been applied to newly qualified motorcycle drivers since 2000 and to private car/light goods vehicle drivers since 2009. During the probationary period, drivers must display a red P-plate at the front and back of the car, must not exceed a speed of if the speed limit of the road is higher than , and must not use the rightmost lane on expressways having three or more lanes. Motorcycle riders may not carry passengers during the probational period. A driver who commits a minor traffic offence during the probationary period will see his period extended by six months, and a second minor offence or a single serious offence will cancel the license entirely, forcing him to retake the driving test for another probationary licence. Drivers who complete the probationary period without committing any offences are eligible for a full-class driving licence. Licences for all other classes of vehicles require the applicant to finish his probationary period.

===India===

All new drivers in India, upon receipt of a provisional licence, must display L plates at all times (usually on the front and rear of the vehicle) and be accompanied by another driver who has held a full and valid licence for the type of vehicle being driven and also be in a position to control the vehicle.

After learners have passed the driving test for the appropriate vehicle, they can switch to a permanent driving license.

===Isle of Man===
Licences may be obtained from the age of 16 and provisional licences require the display of L-plates (similarly to Ireland and the UK). For one year after obtaining a full licence, R-plates (for &quot;restricted&quot;) must be displayed and speed is restricted to (even on unrestricted Manx roads). Unlike the R-plate in Northern Ireland, an Isle of Man R-plate is a red &quot;R&quot; on a square white plate.

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the minimum age for a learner&#x27;s permit is seventeen. Before being awarded this permit, the applicant must pass a computerized Driver Theory Test, and after passing the test, the probationer must display L-plates (one front, and one rear) and be accompanied by a driver who has held a full licence for at least two years. Since 2008, all learner drivers have faced a fine of up to €1,000 for a first offence and €2,000 for a second if they fail to display L-plates.

All learner permit holders, with the exception of those who hold learner permits in category W (work vehicles/land tractors), must display &#x27;L&#x27; plates while they are driving. The letter L should be at least high and appear as red on a white background, in clearly visible vertical positions to the front and rear of the vehicle.

A learner&#x27;s permit is valid for two years, and may be renewed once without the holder having sat a driving test. After this, proof of an upcoming test appointment or a recent test failure is required for further renewal. A permit holder may not sit a test for at least six months after receiving their permit.

Prior to October 2007, a &quot;provisional licence&quot; was issued which had more lax restrictions - on its first renewal, the holder could drive unaccompanied (but must continue to display L plates), and the accompanying driver did not need any experience, just a full licence. The third or further renewals of the licence - e.g. after failing a test and the expiration of the second licence - brought back the accompaniment requirement. This unusual arrangement led to a situation where a learner driver, having failed his driving test on a 2nd Provisional, could legally drive away from the test center unaccompanied.

Prior to December 2007 an L-plate was not required for motorcyclists. A fluorescent tabard displaying an &#x27;L&#x27; on the rear is now required for motorcyclists using a provisional licence or learner permit.

The new measures were introduced in an effort to improve road safety, and will be followed by the introduction of &#x27;tiered licensing&#x27;, with harsher rules applying to those holding a full licence for less than two years. However, the changes were not retroactive.

From 1 August 2014, a person granted a first full driving licence must display N-plates (Novice) on the vehicle for a period of 2 years. The legal requirements for an N plate are that it is not less than 15 centimetres (6&quot;) high in red on a white ground, in clearly visible vertical positions to the front and rear of the vehicle. However, there has been a trend amongst drivers, younger males in particular, who want to keep N plates discreet, whereby they trim the white background on the N plates, leaving just a narrow white border around the letter N or no border at all. The somewhat vague legal requirement implies that the prior may be legal as it does not specify a width for the border. Trimming of N plates generally occurs due to a perceived ‘embarrassment’ of them or the driver is driving a modified vehicle that they do not want attention drawn to.

===Israel===

==== During the studies ====
In Israel, the driving tutoring has to be performed by a special teacher, named &quot;Driving teacher&quot; (). The lessons are performed on a modified vehicle with additional controlling pedals at the front passenger seat: this allows the teacher to control the vehicle during lessons and prevent accidents. Additionally, auxiliary mirrors are fixed atop of side rear-view mirrors, providing the teacher with the rear views.

It is the teacher&#x27;s responsibility to affix the L-plate before each lesson and to remove it after the lesson, therefore the L-plates are usually printed on PVC panels with magnetic base, which eases affixing and removal.

The Israeli L-plate shares the general design of Israeli information signs (square form, blue background). On the blue background is placed a white triangle pointing upwards, with black Hebrew letter &quot;ל&quot; in it, from — &quot;Learning&quot;.

==== After passing the exam ====

For two years after passing the exam, the driver is required to affix a rectangle P-plate bearing the words &quot;new driver&quot; in Hebrew (; optionally, for female driver, or that suits both male and female drivers). The law defines the plate as light-reflective with yellow background and black letters. It has to be fixed in a corner of the rear window, and there are lower limits on plate&#x27;s size and width of the letters. The law restricts the usage of P-plates to new drivers only; the P-plate has to be affixed if and only if the person that drives the vehicle is a new driver.

There are several restrictions on the new driver. For the first three months after receiving the license, he may drive only if there is an experienced driver sitting in the front passenger&#x27;s seat, and the law additionally defines the requirements for the driver to be called &quot;experienced&quot;. The charges for violating traffic laws are much more heavy on the new driver; there is a list of traffic law violations that immediately cancel the new driver&#x27;s license. Additional limitations apply on young drivers: if the new driver is younger than 21 years old, he may not transport more than two passengers without an experienced driver accompanying him in the front passenger&#x27;s seat.

===Japan===
In Japan, new drivers must display a (or ) on the front and rear of their vehicle for their first year, although drivers who consider themselves to be beginners are allowed to continue to display the mark after the year has passed. Although not related to driving experience, the is optional for drivers 70 years old or over and mandatory for 75 years or more. It would theoretically be possible to simultaneously display both a shoshinsha mark and a koreisha mark, for example if a 70-year-old were to be newly licensed.

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, only cars approved by driving schools may be driven by Learner Drivers after passing the theory test. The car (typically a Perodua Kancil or Perodua Viva) is required to have at least one L-plate at the front and the back. In the case of motorcycles, Learner riders must affix an L-sticker onto the front and rear of their motorcycles. The learner&#x27;s driving licence is renewable every 3 or 6 months but cannot be possessed for more than 2 years.

The L-plate is very similar to those used in the United Kingdom and Singapore, with the exception being that two background colors are issued which are blue color background (for all vehicles except motorcycles) and white color background (for motorcycles only). They are allowed to take their practical driving test after 1 month of obtaining the Learner&#x27;s license.

After the learner drivers pass their practical driving tests, they are put under the 2-year probationary period before they may possess the Competent Driving Licence. During the probationary period, they are issued with Probationary Driving Licence and are required to place P-plates at the front and the back of their respective vehicles. They are subject to the Kejara demerit system, where those accumulating 10 points or more during the 2-year probationary period may risk their licences to be revoked. The P-plate design is similar to its L-counterpart, except that the background colour is red and the letter P is white. After the probationary period ends, the drivers are given a one-year grace period to upgrade their licences to Competent Driving Licence.

===Spain===

New drivers must display a standardized (15 cm × 19.5 cm; 6&quot; x 8&quot;), reflective green and white &quot;L&quot; plate on the lower left corner of the rear window for one year after obtaining their first driving license. They no longer have an additional speed restriction. Alcohol levels allowed are lower the first two years, and are the same as those for &quot;professional&quot; drivers.

Driving school cars sport a permanent blue and white &quot;L&quot; plate with the word &#x27;practice&#x27; in red.

===Sweden===
All new drivers learning to drive need to display a green sign (or a red plate if driving with a driving school) with the text &quot;&quot; (driving practice) and need to drive with a supervisor who needs to be at least 24 years of age and who has been a licensed driver for at least 5 consecutive years during the last 10 years. After passing both the theoretical and practical driving tests, the driver gets a provisional license for two years. If a holder of a provisional license commits a violation that would result in a suspension of a normal drivers license, the license is revoked, and the driver must retake the driving tests to be reinstated.

===United Kingdom ===
All new drivers in the United Kingdom, upon receipt of a provisional licence, must display L plates at all times and be accompanied by another driver who is over 21 years of age and has held a full and valid licence for the type of vehicle being driven for at least three years. In Wales either red L plates or red D plates (, &#x27;learner&#x27;) are permitted, due to the bilingual legislation in force within the country, while a learner is driving the vehicle.
In Northern Ireland, drivers with L plates must not exceed .

After learners have passed a driving test for the appropriate vehicle, they may opt to display green P-plates (P for &quot;probationary&quot;) (in England, Scotland or Wales) to show that they have less experience than other drivers. These plates are voluntary and not required by law or the Highway Code.

L plates are required to be displayed at all times whilst riding a motorcycle or moped of no more than after passing motorcycle compulsory basic training (CBT) but before passing a full motorcycle test.

==== Northern Ireland ====
In Northern Ireland, for one year after the passing of a car driving test, the driver is defined as a &quot;restricted driver&quot; who must not exceed 45 mph and must display an &quot;R-plate&quot; consisting of an amber sans-serif R on a white background. Riders of medium-sized (category A2) and large (category A) motorcycles who pass their test after 19 January 2013 can ride at speeds in excess of 45 mph but will still be required to clearly display R plates. L-plates in Northern Ireland commonly have an R-plate as a reverse side.

===United States===

====New Jersey====

In New Jersey, effective May 1, 2010, drivers under the age of 21 holding a learner&#x27;s permit or probationary license must display detachable red decals on the front and back license plates of their vehicles.

== Similar plates ==
Elsewhere in the world, varying designs are used. In Germany, a usually red plate displaying the word (driving school) is placed on the vehicles during instruction. In Sweden, the plate is green or red (for driving schools) with the text (driving practice). In Czechoslovakia, a white L on a blue field, similar to the Swiss one, had been used, but many driving schools have stopped using them recently, instead tagging their cars with the word (&quot;car school&quot;). In Italy, driving schools&#x27; cars are tagged with the words (&quot;driving school&quot;), and private cars with beginner drivers are tagged with a &quot;P&quot; capital letter: both signs are black on white reflective background. In Finland, a white triangle (equilateral with 16–25 cm sides) is required in the back of a vehicle used to give driving instruction. Between 1972 and 1996, new drivers were limited to less than in the first year, and had to use a white round &quot;80&quot; plaque (colloquially ) in the rear window or as a sticker on the back of the vehicle.

<text>is a vertically scrolling shoot&#x27;em up arcade game developed by Raizing and published by Eighting in 1996. It was later ported to the Sega Saturn in 1998, and an updated version, Battle Garegga Rev.2016 was released in 2016. It was followed by a spiritual successor titled &quot;Battle Bakraid&quot; in 1999.

==Gameplay==

In addition to the player&#x27;s main shot, picking up green Option power-ups will add up to four support pods to the craft. The formation of these Options can be changed to one of five presets and there are additional secret formations that can be accessed by dropping a certain number of power-ups before picking up the next. Both shot and options are fired by holding the A button.

Upon killing a regular enemy on the ground, a red Small Bomber token will appear. Picking up enough of these gives the player one Large Bomber token, but the player can use their remaining Small Bombers without a Large Bomber in stock; the duration or strength of the bomb will merely be reduced according to the percentage of a full bomb that was used. Up to five Large Bombers can be in stock at any one time, after which each Small token is worth 100 points.

Power-ups and medals drop from popcorn enemies in a fixed order. Every time a Medal is collected, the next one that spawns will be worth more, from 100 to 10,000 points, but if a medal falls off the bottom of the screen, the next one to spawn will be of the lowest value. Medals can also be found upon using a bomb on certain items of scenery.

The game features an adjustable difficulty system that will increase difficulty based on the actions of the player. Uncontrolled increase of the game&#x27;s rank can quickly turn it into a manic shooter. Firing and powering up the main weapon, as well as picking up various items, will increase the difficulty of the game. Losing a life will decrease the difficulty (rank) of the game. The fewer lives a player has when they die, the more rank is decreased, thus, the game rewards a player who doesn&#x27;t stock up many lives at a time. Players are thus &quot;forced&quot; to keep themselves powered down, conserve shots, and lose lives on purpose in order to keep the last few stages of the game playable, though it is possible to finish the game in one life given an intricate knowledge of the game&#x27;s rank system and an ultra-prudent playstyle.

Unlike in most other scrolling shooter games, where bullets are often brightly colored to distinguish from the background, bullets are realistically colored, making it difficult for players to see them. Exploding enemies and objects also create flying debris, further camouflaging incoming fire. This was ameliorated to some extent in the Type 2 version, which replaces most of the standard bullets with yellow dots.

==Plot==
Mathew Wayne, a resident of a small country town, was a mechanical genius whose aptitude and skills were passed down to his sons, Brian and Jason. After gaining leadership of his automobile factory from him, the brothers&#x27; skills became renowned throughout the country. Eventually, the Federation approached the brothers with an extremely profitable contract to help produce military vehicles for it. The Wayne brothers accepted the contract and created weapons without peer.

A short time later, the skies turned dark with the Federation&#x27;s encroaching airfleet, and towns and cities everywhere were ravaged by these armies—including Brian and Jason&#x27;s home town. To their horror, the Federation was using the weapons and vehicles they themselves had designed to reshape the land to their pitiless will. Taking up planes whose designs had never been submitted to the Federation, the Wayne brothers prepare to destroy the Federation&#x27;s mad scheme.

== Development ==
Programmer Shinobu Yagawa worked on this game, and he had previously worked on the game &quot;Recca&quot; in 1992. He would later work on games like &quot;Ibara&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Pink Sweets&quot;.

==Release ==
The original arcade game was released on February 3, 1996, and released on Sega Saturn on February 26, 1998. The Sega Saturn version has become a rare game, and in 2014 it was listed as costing £100 in the United Kingdom. The Saturn version is also the final game on the system, and by extension any Sega console, to be published in any capacity by Electronic Arts.

In December 2016 M2 released a new version of the game called &quot;Battle Garegga Rev.2016&quot; to PlayStation 4 as part of their M2 Shot Triggers publishing label. An Xbox One version was released the following year, along with an English version for both platforms.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Battle Garegga&quot; on their March 15, 1996 issue as being the eighth most-successful arcade game of the month.

Three reviewers from the Japanese &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; gave it an 8/10 each.

German magazine &quot;Maniac&quot; gave the Saturn version a score of 57% and the PS4 version a score of 81%.

&quot;Famitsu&quot; gave &quot;Battle Garegga Rev.2016&quot;, a score of 32 out of 40.

In 2012, Hardcore Gaming 101 called the game &quot;an absolute classic&quot;. In 2016, Eurogamer summarized: &quot;For all its routine, slightly drab looks, this is a game of exquisite artistic intention.&quot; IGN Japan gave the PS4 version 8.9 out of 10. Reviewing the PS4 version, Push Square said: &quot;It may be an acquired taste these days – to be fair, the same could be said of the original back in 1996 – but Battle Garegga remains a defining release in the shmup canon, and this is without a shadow of a doubt the best way to experience it.&quot;

<text>The Ugly Duckling is a one-act play by A.A. Milne written .

==Plot==
The king and queen are worried because their daughter, Princess Camilla, is very plain, or rather appears to be plain because of a spell put on her at birth. The spell says that only the eyes of true love will reveal her beauty. Her parents come up with a plan to marry her to a prince from a far-away land who is unaware of what she looks like. They force Camilla to trade places with her beautiful but silly maid, Dulcibella, before the prince arrives.

However, Prince Simon has also disguised himself as his servant Carlo, and dressed Carlo up as the prince because he felt he wasn&#x27;t handsome enough. Both the pretend prince and princess are insanely dull-witted, which just adds to the entertainment. Before the marriage of the two servants dressed as royalty, the real prince meets the real princess and they reveal their identity and begin to understand each other.

Prince Simon tells Princess Camilla that she is very beautiful, although all other princes have found her to be hideously ugly. Then the princess reveals that she was given a gift from her great aunt that would make everyone ignorant of her real beauty, so that she wouldn&#x27;t grow up vain – until the day she met her one true love. The play ends with a riddle, required to be answered correctly by the prince before he can wed the princess.

What is it which has four legs and mews like a cat?
— The Chancellor

Despite the fact that Carlo, the mock-prince, was given the correct answer beforehand, he answers incorrectly. The answer clearly should have been &quot;cat&quot;, but Carlo&#x27;s answer was &quot;dog&quot;. Yet with some quick thinking from Prince Simon, Carlo gets the answer right because Simon claims that what is referred to in this country as &quot;cat&quot; is referred to as &quot;dog&quot; in the mock-prince&#x27;s country.

In our country, we have an animal to which we have given the name “dog,” or, in the local dialect of the more mountainous districts, “doggie.” It sits by the fireside and purrs. — The Prince

At the very end, the king wonders why Princess Camilla is suddenly beautiful when the audience can see that it is because of the blessing–curse coming to fruition—Camilla has found her true love, the first one to whom she appears lovely.

==Adaptations==
The Fall 2009 issue of the University of San Francisco literary journal &quot;Switchback&quot; features a story by Charles Haddox, &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot;, about a girl who has her own ugly duckling experience after being chosen to play the role of Princess Camilla in her junior high school&#x27;s production of the play.

In 1985 &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; was adapted by Simon Johnston for two actors and a music trio ( www.simonjohnston.ca ). It was commissioned by Laura Schlessinger, artistic director of Music Mosaic (The New Concert Theatre Society) based in Canmore Alberta. Allan Bell composed the music and Bev Ross wrote the libretto. The production, directed by Simon Johnston, featured knee-high puppets designed and constructed by Felix Mirbt of Sutton, Quebec. Karen Skidmore and Patrick Meschukuleit performed all the roles, songs and puppet manipulation.

<doc id="632084" wikidata="Q739324" url="?curid=632084" title="Tenth of Tevet">
<text>Tenth of Tevet (), or Asarah BeTevet (), the tenth day of the Hebrew month of Tevet, is a fast day in Judaism. It is one of the minor fasts observed even in erev Shabbat from before dawn to nightfall, while other fast days are then postponed after Shabbat. The fast mourns the 587 BCE siege of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylonia—an event that began on that date and ultimately culminated in the destruction of Solomon&#x27;s Temple (i.e., the First Temple), the downfall of the Kingdom of Judah, and the Babylonian exile of the Judeans.

The fast day is not related to Hanukkah but happens to follow that festival by a week. Whether the 10th of Tevet occurs seven or eight days after the last day of Hanukkah depends on whether the preceding Hebrew month of Kislev has 29 or 30 days in the given Hebrew year.

==History==
According to 2 Kings 25:1–25, on the 10th day of the 10th month of Tevet, in the ninth year of Zedekiah&#x27;s reign (588 BCE), Nebuchadnezzar II, the second Neo-Babylonian emperor, began the siege of Jerusalem. Eighteen months later, on the 17th of Tammuz at the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah&#x27;s reign (586 BCE), he broke through the city walls. The Romans would similarly break through the walls of Jerusalem on the 17th of Tammuz during their Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE). (In the Biblical calendar, each year in the reign of the Kings of Judah or Israel is dated from 1 Nissan. Hence, Tevet (tenth month) of Year 9 of Zedekiah is only 18 months before Tammuz (fourth month) of Year 11 of Zedekiah.)

The siege ended with the destruction of the Temple three weeks later, on Tisha B&#x27;Av, the end of the kingdoms. The elite of Judah were taken to exile in Babylon. The Tenth of Tevet is part of the cycle of three fasts connected with these events.

The first reference to the Tenth of Tevet as a fast appears in Zechariah 8, where it is called the &quot;fast of the tenth month&quot;. One opinion in the Talmud states that the &quot;fast of the tenth month&quot; refers to the &quot;fifth&quot; of Tevet, when, according to Ezekiel 33:21, news of the destruction of the Temple reached those already in exile in Babylon. However, the tenth is the date observed today, according to the other opinion presented in the Talmud. Other references to the fast and the affliction can be found in the Book of Ezekiel (the siege) and the Book of Jeremiah.

According to tradition, as described by the liturgy for the day&#x27;s selichot, the fast also commemorates other calamities that occurred throughout Jewish history on the Tenth of Tevet and the two days preceding it:
* On the eighth of Tevet one year during the 3rd century BCE, a time of Hellenistic rule of Judea during the Second Temple period, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the Ptolemaic pharaoh of Egypt, ordered the translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek. This work later became known as the Septuagint. Seventy-two sages were placed in solitary confinement and ordered to translate the Torah into Greek.

Judaism sees this event as a tragedy, reflecting a deprivation and debasement of the divine nature of the Torah and a subversion of its spiritual and literary qualities. They reasoned that the Torah&#x27;s legal codes and deeper layers of meaning would be lost upon translation from the original Hebrew. Many Jewish laws are formulated in terms of specific Hebrew words employed in the Torah; without the original Hebrew wording, the authenticity and essence of the legal system would be damaged. The mystical ideas contained in the Torah are also drawn from the original Hebrew. As such, these would not be accessed by individuals studying the Torah in Greek (or any other language) alone.
* On the ninth of Tevet, &quot;something happened, but we do not know what it was...&quot; (&quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;). The selichot liturgy for the day states that Ezra, the great leader who brought some Jews back to the Holy Land from the Babylonian exile and who ushered in the era of the Second Temple, died on this day, and this is verified by the Kol Bo. But according to the earlier sources (the Geonim as recorded by Bahag and cited in Tur Orach Chaim 580), the specific tragedy of 9 Tevet is unknown. Some manuscripts of Simeon Kayyara (not those available to the Tur) &quot;add&quot; that Ezra and Nechemiah died on this day—but only after first stating that the Chazal gave no reason for why the day is tragic. Other suggestions are given as to why the ninth of Tevet is notable as well.

==Observance==
As with all minor &quot;ta&#x27;anit&quot; (Jewish days of fasting), the Tenth of Tevet begins at dawn (&#x27;) and concludes at nightfall (&#x27;). Following the general rules of minor fasts as outlined in the &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;, and in contrast to Tisha B&#x27;Av, there are no additional requirements beyond fasting (e.g., the prohibitions against bathing and wearing leather shoes).

Further akin to other minor fasts, &quot;Halakha&quot; exempts individuals who are ill, as well as pregnant and nursing persons who struggle with fasting. The &quot;Mishnah Berurah&quot; notes that it is still commendable to observe all the restrictions of Tisha B&#x27;Av on the minor fast days except for the restriction of wearing leather shoes. Even so, it says, one should not refrain from bathing in preparation for Shabbat when the Tenth of Tevet falls on a Friday.

A Torah reading, the &quot;Aneinu&quot; prayer in the &quot;Amidah&quot;, and the &quot;Avinu Malkeinu&quot; prayer are added at both shacharit and mincha services in many communities unless the fast falls on Friday, when &quot;Tachanun&quot; and &quot;Avinu Malkeinu&quot; are not said at mincha. At shacharit services, &quot;Selichot&quot; are also said, and at mincha in Ashkenazi congregations, the Haftarah is read.

The Tenth of Tevet is the only minor fast day that can coincide with Friday in the current Hebrew calendar. When it does, the unusual event of a Torah and Haftarah reading at the mincha right before Shabbat occurs. This is fairly rare; the most recent occurrence was on 10 January 2025 (as well as 22nd of December 2024 observance.) If it falls on Friday, the fast must be observed until nightfall, even though Shabbat begins before sunset (up to 72 minutes earlier, depending on the &quot;halakhic&quot; authority), and even though this requires one to enter Shabbat hungry from the fast, something typically avoided. It cannot be determined for sure whether other fasts would have the same ruling, because no other fast day can fall out on Friday, except for the Fast of the Firstborn when Passover begins on Friday night.

Although this fast is considered a minor fast, David Abudarham attributed to it an additional theoretical stringency not shared by any other fast except Yom Kippur, namely that if the Tenth of Tevet were to fall out on a Shabbat, this fast would be observed on Shabbat. (This cannot happen under the current arrangement of the Hebrew calendar.) The reason the fasts of the Tenth of Tevet and Yom Kippur must be observed on the actual day on which they occur is because of the phrase &quot;the very day&quot; () is used about both of them, in Ezekiel 24:2 about the Tenth of Tevet, and similarly for Yom Kippur in Leviticus 23:28. This view is rejected by the &quot;Beit Yosef&quot; and all other major &quot;halakhic&quot; authorities, but was popularized by Rabbi Moses Sofer, who wrote a commentary based on the philosophy behind this view.

Although the Tenth of Tevet is an annual observance on the Jewish calendar, its placement toward the end of the Gregorian calendar year means that in some Gregorian years, there is no observance of the fast, while in other years, the fast is observed twice. Thus, the Tenth of Tevet did not occur at all in 2019. Instead, the &quot;2019&quot; observance of the fast took place in January 2020, while the subsequent observance occurred in December 2020.

===Day of general kaddish===
The Chief Rabbinate of Israel chose to observe the Tenth of Tevet as a &quot;general Kaddish day&quot; (&quot;yom hakaddish ha&#x27;klalli&quot;) to allow the relatives of those whose yahrtzeit (anniversary of their death) is unknown, including Holocaust victims, to mourn their loss. Relatives may observe the traditional yahrtzeit practices for the deceased, including lighting a memorial candle, learning &quot;mishnayot&quot;, and reciting Kaddish. According to the policy of the Chief Rabbinate in Israel, the memorial prayer is also recited in synagogues after the reading of the Torah at the morning services. To some religious Jews, this day is preferable as a remembrance day to Yom HaShoah since the latter occurs in the month of Nisan, in which mourning is traditionally prohibited.

<text>Private Product Remaining or PPR is a means of national income accounting similar to the more commonly encountered GNP. Since government is financed through taxation and any resulting output is not (usually) sold on the market, what value is ascribed to it is disputed (see calculation problem), and it is counted in GNP. Murray Rothbard developed the GPP (Gross Private Product) and PPR measures. GPP is GNP minus income originating in government and government enterprises. PPR is GPP minus the higher of government expenditures and tax revenues plus interest received.

formula_1

* C is the private consumption
* I is the Investments
* G is Government Spending
* X is Exports
* M is Imports

For example, in an economy in which the private expenditures total $1,000 and government expenditures total $200, the GNP would be $1,200, GPP would be $1,000, and PPR would be $800.

<doc id="632086" wikidata="Q62336" url="?curid=632086" title="Wilhelm von Biela">
<text>Baron Wilhelm von Biela (; March 19, 1782 – February 18, 1856) was a German-Austrian military officer and amateur astronomer.

Wilhelm von Biela was born in Roßla, Harz (Northern Germany). He was a descendant of a prominent Protestant noble family originally from what is now the Czech Republic, the family having been exiled to Saxony after its head, Friedrich von Biela, was executed in Prague in 1621 during the religious wars of the period. Biela was the last member of his branch of the family.

After study at military college in Dresden, Biela joined the Austrian army in 1802, serving as a cadet in the Infantry Regiment &#x27;Graf Stuart&#x27; Nr. 18. He rose to the rank of a captain of Grenadiers and participated in a number of military campaigns against Napoleon between 1805, 1809 and later on. In 1813 he was an Adjutant to General Merveldt at the Battle of Leipzig, where he was wounded.

In 1815 Biela went to Prague, where he commenced study of astronomy under Martin Alois David. He later served in Italy and was appointed the commandant of the town of Rovigo.

In the field of astronomy, he specialized in observing and calculating the orbits of comets. He also did some sunspot observations and published a series of articles, mostly in the &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;, on subjects such as comets, the theoretical considerations of comets &quot;falling into the Sun&quot;, Tycho Brahe, and occultations of stars by the Moon. He also published a longer work on planetary rotation, &quot;Die zweite grosse Weltenkraft, nebst Ideen über einige Geheimnisse der physischen Astronomie, oder Andeutungen zu einer Theorie der Tangentialkraft&quot; (Prague, 1836). In its preface he stated that although the work was the fruit of many years of study, it could be read through in half an hour.

Biela independently discovered two comets that others had already found (notably the Great Comet of 1823, C/1823 Y1) and made one independent discovery of his own: the periodic Biela&#x27;s Comet, which subsequently split in two and disintegrated. The lunar crater Biela is named after him.

Relatively little seems to be recorded of Biela&#x27;s personal life: he was married to Anna (Edle von Wallenstern) and they had a daughter Emilie Freiin von Biela, born in 1820 and married in Rovigo to Moritz, Graf Forgách, another Austrian infantry officer, by whom she had two children.

In the 1840s Biela retired to Venice, where he died in 1856.

The minor planet 2281 Biela is named in his honor.

<doc id="632089" wikidata="Q3350195" url="?curid=632089" title="Old Louisville">
<text>Old Louisville is a historic district and neighborhood in central Louisville, Kentucky, United States. It is the third largest such district in the United States, and the largest preservation district featuring almost entirely Victorian architecture. It is also unique in that a majority of its structures are made of brick, and the neighborhood contains the highest concentration of residential homes with stained glass windows in the U.S. Many of the buildings are in the Victorian era styles of Romanesque Revival, Queen Anne, or Italianate, and many blocks have had few or no buildings razed. There are also several 20th-century buildings from 15 to 20 stories.

Old Louisville consists of about forty-eight city blocks and is located north of the University of Louisville&#x27;s main campus and south of Broadway and Downtown Louisville, in the central portion of the modern city. The neighborhood hosts the annual St. James Court Art Show on the first weekend in October.

Old Louisville was built as a suburb of Louisville starting in the 1870s, nearly a century after the city was founded. It was initially called the Southern Extension, and the name &quot;Old Louisville&quot; did not come into use until the 1960s. Old Louisville was initially home to some of Louisville&#x27;s wealthiest residents, but saw a decline in the early and mid-20th century. Following revitalization efforts and gentrification, Old Louisville is currently home to a diverse population with a high concentration of students and young professionals.

==History==
Large-scale development in Louisville south of Broadway did not begin until the 1870s, nearly a century after what is now Downtown Louisville was first settled. The area was initially part of three different military land grants issued in 1773, and throughout the early and mid-19th century the land passed through the hands of several speculators while much of it was used as farmland. Some of the land south of Broadway was still in its natural state during this time, such as the tract between Broadway and Breckenridge, known as Jacob&#x27;s Woods, a popular picnic ground as late as 1845. A major attraction was Oakland Race Track.

Country estates had been built in the area as early as the 1830s, and some of Louisville&#x27;s great early mansions, predominantly in the Italianate style, were built along Broadway, very near Old Louisville, before the Civil War. Development from 1850 to 1870 occurred between Broadway and Kentucky Street, the northern extreme of what came to be called Old Louisville. North-south city streets were extended throughout the area in the 1850s, and a mulecar line was extended down Fourth to Oak in 1865.

The land south of Broadway that became Old Louisville was annexed by the city in 1868, as a part of larger expansion efforts. This annexation moved the southern boundary of the city as far south as the city&#x27;s House of Refuge, an area which is now the University of Louisville campus and the southern border of Old Louisville. A year later, architect Gideon Shryock called the area &quot;a growing and beautiful suburban locality&quot;. By 1876 about a quarter of the area was occupied.

Development continued as lots were sold southward to present day Oak Street, about a third of the way between Broadway and the House of Refuge. The principal road through the suburb at this time was Central Plank Road, which became Third Street. The emerging area was called the Southern Extension by this time. Growth south of Oak was very slow until the Southern Exposition was held annually in the area from 1883 to 1887.

At the urging of &quot;Courier Journal&quot; editor Henry Watterson, the city held the Southern Exposition, which in the words of Watterson, was meant to &quot;advance the material welfare of the producing classes of the South and West.&quot; It was held on at the heart of Old Louisville, where St. James Court and Central Park (originally Dupont Square) would eventually be located, and included a 600 by enclosed exhibition building. The Exposition was opened by President Chester Arthur and attracted nearly one million visitors in its first year. The exhibition featured the first public display of Thomas Edison&#x27;s light bulb, as well as what was billed as the largest artificial lighting display in history with 4,600 lamps, in a time when electric lighting was considered a novelty.

During the 1880s, after the exposition ended, the area between Oak and Hill Streets rapidly developed and became one of the city&#x27;s most fashionable neighborhoods. According to historian Young E. Allison, 260 homes valued at a total of $1.6 million were constructed in Old Louisville from 1883 to 1886. The dominant styles by this time were Queen Anne and Richardsonian Romanesque. An example of the latter, which was known for its turrets, towers and bay windows, was the Conrad house at St. James Court.

These styles became less prevalent in the 1890s as the remaining southern portions of Old Louisville, between Ormsby and the House of refuge, were filled in, predominantly with buildings in the Chateauesque and Renaissance Revival styles. This included one of Old Louisville&#x27;s most famous sections, St. James Court, developed starting in 1890 and envisioned as a haven for the upper class, and was completely occupied by 1905. Described as &quot;the epitome of Victorian eclecticism&quot;, the area included houses in such styles as Venetian, Colonial, Gothic and others.

From 1890 to 1905 the area was home to the Amphitheatre Auditorium, which claimed the second largest stage in the United States and showcased many of the day&#x27;s best actors. The structure, located at the corner of 4th and Hill Streets, was razed after its owner William Norton Jr. died. Another form of entertainment in the area was baseball, with the game first being played by 1860 and an early ballpark at Fourth and Ormsby emerging after the Civil War. By 1875, a new park had been built near St. James Court.

Old Louisville is also home to the Ferguson Mansion, built by Edwin Hite Ferguson. Ferguson commissioned the Louisville architectural firm of Cobb and Dodd—the same firm responsible for designing the Seelbach Hotel and the new capitol building in Frankfort—to design his home in 1901. Construction of the mansion took four years (1901–1905) and cost $100,000, which was approximately ten times the cost of the neighboring Victorian homes. At the time, the mansion was the most expensive home in Louisville. In the 1920s, the Fergusons sold the home to the Pearson family, and it served as the Pearson Funeral Home until the mid-1970s. The house also provided the headquarters for John Y. Brown Jr.&#x27;s successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. In 1986, the mansion became the headquarters of The Filson Historical Society.

At its peak in the late 19th century, Old Louisville was the center of Louisville&#x27;s high society, with nearly all persons listed in the &quot;Society Directory of Louisville&quot; having Old Louisville addresses. The directory also listed the reception days and hours of Old Louisville&#x27;s leading ladies, which varied by street (such as Tuesdays on Fourth Street or Thursdays on Second).

===Decline===

Old Louisville gradually declined as many of its wealthy inhabitants moved to newer streetcar suburbs such as Cherokee Triangle or built estates in areas east of Louisville recently connected by railroad such as Anchorage and Glenview. Many of the large homes in Old Louisville were converted to boarding houses during the Great Depression, and the Ohio River flood of 1937 caused many of the remaining wealthy households to move above the river&#x27;s flood plain.

The gradual abandonment of Old Louisville by the wealthy was a reflection of changing lifestyles brought on by technology. Many homes of Old Louisville were originally built as mansions that would require several servants to maintain. Because of the relatively high wages offered by manufacturing jobs, servants were no longer affordable to all but the wealthiest families by the mid-20th century. Interurban rail lines, and increasingly automobiles, meant that the wealthy no longer had to live so close to their businesses, and many chose to live in what had previously been summer homes in the county&#x27;s east end. The lifestyle that created Old Louisville was effectively obsolete.

In the interwar period, many of the neighborhood&#x27;s old mansions were hastily converted into apartments to house the growing labor supply, a practice encouraged by the federal government at the time through low-interest loans. However, after World War II, with the housing shortage solved by large-scale suburban development affordable to the middle class, vacancy rates in Old Louisville surged. To attract renters, landlords in Old Louisville had to lower rents dramatically, attracting less affluent tenants.

A large section of the neighborhood, from around Kentucky Street to Broadway, was razed. Many buildings south of Lee Street, and nearly all south of Avery Street (renamed Cardinal Boulevard) were razed for the construction of Noe Middle School, expansions to DuPont Manual High School and the University of Louisville, and expansions to industry east of Floyd Street. From 1965 to 1971, 639 buildings were razed as a part of this effort. However, the plan did spur the restoration of over 100 buildings in other parts of Old Louisville.

During the 1960s many low income residents downtown who were displaced as a result of urban renewal moved into the newly converted apartments, especially on the north side of the neighborhood. The area was now considered drug ridden and undesirable by most Louisvillians. The very term &quot;Old Louisville&quot;, first becoming associated with the area in the 1940s, had mostly negative connotations initially, as historian Samuel W. Thomas put it, &quot;In an Era where architectural styles were changing dramatically, &quot;old&quot; meant out of fashion&quot;.

===Revitalization===
One of the first to take an active role in preserving and revitalizing Old Louisville was Louisville &quot;Courier Journal&quot; writer J. Douglas Nunn. In 1960, he began a vigorous public information campaign concerning the area. Nunn compared it to neighborhoods such as Georgetown in Washington, D.C. and Beacon Hill in Boston. In 1961 Nunn took a leave of absence from his job and started &quot;Restoration, Inc.&quot;, a group that restored ten homes in Old Louisville&#x27;s Belgravia Court in 1961. This spurred interest in preservation that led many local activists to move to the area, and led to the first use of the name &quot;Old Louisville&quot; in print in that year. With the activists&#x27; efforts, the area was made a historic preservation district in 1975. The area has continued to improve, with new restaurants and shops opening and many students, and young professionals moving into the area. Property owners, who once cheaply converted the old houses to apartments, have invested more in improvements since the 1980s, and several properties have been converted into luxury condominiums. The median home value more than doubled between 1990 and 2000, increasing at a faster rate than Louisville as a whole. This process has been described as gentrification.

The area is now one of the most ethnically and economically diverse in Louisville. Crime is becoming less of a problem. While in 2003 there were 11.5 crimes per 1,000 residents, over twice the average for the city of Louisville as a whole, which was 5.0 crimes per 1,000 residents Old Louisville now has a similar number of calls for police assistance as other parts of Louisville. The Louisville Metro Police 4th Division is responsible for a large portion of Louisville beyond Old Louisville, but is conveniently located in Central Park in Old Louisville. It had 134 officers assigned to it in 2006. Most calls are related to car break-ins and non-violent crimes. Murders are still rare, with one or two per year. Overall crime rates for both Old Louisville and the city as a whole increased sharply in 2005 over the 2004 rate, although there was a decline again the first half of 2006.

==Features and attractions==

Old Louisville features the largest collection of pedestrian-only streets of any U.S. neighborhood. Eleven such &quot;courts&quot;, where houses face each other across a grass median with sidewalks, were built in the neighborhood from 1891 to the 1920s. Most of the courts are centered off of 4th Street. Belgravia Court and Fountain Court were the first ones to be built in 1891 and are the most well known. Later ones included Reeser and Kensington (1910), which were built with large Victorian styled apartments instead of single family homes; and Eutropia and Rose Courts, which were the last ones built in the 1920s and featured small, single story houses. Belgravia and St. James Court were partially rehabilitated as a part of the urban renewal that began in the 1960s. These developments are apparently unique to Louisville.

Two of the three major four-year universities in Louisville are located adjacent to Old Louisville, with Spalding University to the north and the University of Louisville to the south. DuPont Manual High School, a public magnet school, and Presentation Academy, a Catholic girls&#x27; high school, are also located in Old Louisville.

The neighborhood contains The Filson Historical Society, Louisville&#x27;s Central Park, which features the Kentucky Shakespeare Festival every summer, the Actors Theatre of Louisville Production Studio, and the Conrad-Caldwell House. The area of 6th and Hill Streets in the neighborhood was the setting of the best selling novel &quot;Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch&quot; by Louisvillian Alice Hegan Rice. Today there is a non-profit counseling and services center, named Cabbage Patch Settlement House for the novel, on 6th Street at Magnolia Avenue, which serves children of low-income families. During the Christmas holiday season a number of private homes are toured in the Old Louisville Holiday Home Tour.

Old Louisville&#x27;s boundaries are Kentucky Street to the north, Avery Street (Cardinal Boulevard) to the south, I-65 to the east, the CSX railroad tracks to the west. Originally, the neighborhood extended all the way to Broadway on the north, Attwood Street on the south, and Floyd Street on the East; but the northern part was mostly razed for parking lots and light industry, the southern area between Attwood and Avery Streets (now Cardinal Blvd) was razed when the University of Louisville doubled the size of its main campus, and I-65 was built through the area in the 1960s, which created a physical barrier between it and Shelby Park neighborhood.

===Architecture===
Old Louisville is well known for its architecture, with styles ranging from Federal to Queen Anne. Very few antebellum buildings remain, and the most impressive buildings were built in the late 19th century. There are a few Italianate, Beaux-Arts and Second Empire-style houses, but Victorian styles dominate. Victorian Gothic styles are commonly seen. Many styles in Old Louisville are united by their use of red sandstone trim, which became popular by the 1880s to the point that the &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; said that &quot;few new residences are going up in Louisville in which it is &quot;not&quot; being used&quot;. Another common Victorian style in the area is Richardsonian Romanesque.

Aside from the best represented styles of architecture listed above, Old Louisville also has several great examples of the Chateauesque style of architecture in select buildings throughout the area. For example, one of these examples is a residential building, a mansion, at 400 Belgravia Court, which is a &quot;walking court&quot; where the mansions face a park like walk rather than a street. This specific building was completed in 1897 and one of its first residents was William H. Wathen, M.D., an eminent medical educator in Louisville from a family of successful distillers.

Although some portions have been razed, many entire blocks remain almost untouched, and historian Theodore M. Brown said &quot;it remains the only nineteenth-century segment of the city that is mostly intact&quot;. Some American Craftsman style houses can be found in Old Louisville, which were built as infills.

==Demographics==

As of 2000, the population of Old Louisville was 11,043, of which 55.9% are white, 35.0% are black, 6.3% are listed as other, and 2.3% are Hispanic. College graduates are 24.5%, people without a high school degree are 22.6%, and people with college experience without a bachelor&#x27;s degree are 28.4%. Females are 52.3% of the population, males are 47.7%. Households making less than $15,000 a year are 40.8%; although that is largely a function of the 27% of residents who are full-time college students. Ironically, &quot;Old&quot; Louisville has the &quot;youngest&quot; median age of any Louisville neighborhood and the highest percent of people between the ages of 20–29 (25%).

Old Louisville&#x27;s is about in area, and its population density is 7,800 persons per square mile. The best preserved portions, between Kentucky and Hill streets, have a density of over 10,000 persons per square mile.

==Regions==

Old Louisville is broken up into five different census tracts by the US Census Bureau. There are stark differences revealed by the different tracts from north to south.

Old Louisville has eight different neighborhood associations, each of which provides different infrastructure. For example, on 4th Street the street lights are designed as old lamp posts and trash cans are ornamented with fleurs-de-lis, while on St. James Court there are gas lamp posts, 3rd and 2nd Streets have small light posts on the sidewalks, and Ouerbacker Court has cast iron decorative gates.

==Culture==
After years of decline with abandoned buildings and high elderly populations, the demographics of Old Louisville began to change noticeably in the 1990s. New residents were not just college students using the area as housing, but also young professionals who wanted to live in Old Louisville. The &quot;Courier-Journal&quot; &quot;Velocity&quot; weekly has reported the area as a hip, emerging center of culture in Louisville. This change is reflected in numerous coffeehouses, restaurants and bars opening in Old Louisville in the 1990s and early 2000s targeting at the younger crowd.

Old Louisville is one of the most liberal neighborhoods in Louisville and the state of Kentucky. In 2004, it voted for Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry by a 60% margin and against a successful proposal to amend the state constitution to define marriage as &quot;between one man and one woman&quot; by a 66% margin.

<doc id="632091" wikidata="Q1113306" url="?curid=632091" title="Civil Rights Act of 1866">
<text>The Civil Rights Act of 1866 (, enacted April 9, 1866, reenacted 1870) was the first United States federal law to define citizenship and affirm that all citizens are equally protected by the law. It was mainly intended, in the wake of the American Civil War, to protect the civil rights of persons of African descent born in or brought to the United States.

The Act was passed by Congress in 1866 and vetoed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson. In April 1866, Congress again passed the bill to support the Thirteenth Amendment, and Johnson again vetoed it, but a two-thirds majority in each chamber overrode the veto to allow it to become law without presidential signature.

John Bingham and other congressmen argued that Congress did not yet have sufficient constitutional power to enact this law. Following passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, Congress ratified the 1866 Act in 1870.

==Primary objectives, introduction and amendment==
The act had three primary objectives for the integration of African Americans into the American society following the Civil War: 1.) a definition of American citizenship 2.) the rights which come with this citizenship and 3.) the unlawfulness to deprive any person of citizenship rights &quot;on the basis of race, color, or prior condition of slavery or involuntary servitude.&quot; The act accomplished these three primary objectives.

The author of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 was United States Senator Lyman Trumbull. Congressman James F. Wilson summarized what he considered to be the purpose of the act as follows, when he introduced the legislation in the House of Representatives:

During the subsequent legislative process, the following key provision was deleted: &quot;there shall be no discrimination in civil rights or immunities among the inhabitants of any State or Territory of the United States on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.&quot; John Bingham was an influential supporter of this deletion, on the ground that courts might construe the term &quot;civil rights&quot; more broadly than people like Wilson intended. Weeks later, Senator Trumbull described the bill&#x27;s intended scope:

On April 5, 1866, the Senate overrode President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s veto. This marked the first time that the U.S. Congress ever overrode a presidential veto for a major piece of legislation.

==Content==
With an incipit of &quot;An Act to protect all Persons in the United States in their Civil Rights, and furnish the Means of their vindication&quot;, the act declared that all people born in the United States who are not subject to any foreign power are entitled to be citizens, without regard to race, color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude. A similar provision (called the Citizenship Clause) was written a few months later into the proposed Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

The Civil Rights Act of 1866 also said that any citizen has the same right that a white citizen has to make and enforce contracts, sue and be sued, give evidence in court, and inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property. Additionally, the act guaranteed to all citizens the &quot;full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of person and property, as is enjoyed by white citizens, and ... like punishment, pains, and penalties...&quot; Persons who denied these rights on account of race or previous enslavement were guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction faced a fine not exceeding $1,000, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both.

The act used language very similar to that of the Equal Protection Clause in the newly proposed Fourteenth Amendment. In particular, the act discussed the need to provide &quot;reasonable protection to all persons in their constitutional rights of equality before the law, without distinction of race or color, or previous condition of slavery or involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly convicted. ...&quot;

This statute was a major part of general federal policy during Reconstruction, and was closely related to the Second Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Act of 1866. According to Congressman John Bingham, &quot;the seventh and eighth sections of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau bill enumerate the same rights and all the rights and privileges that are enumerated in the first section of this [the Civil Rights] bill.&quot;

Parts of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 are enforceable into the 21st century, according to the United States Code:

One section of the United States Code (42 U.S.C. §1981), is §1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 as revised and amended by subsequent Acts of Congress. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 was reenacted by the Enforcement Act of 1870, ch. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144, codified as sections 1977 and 1978 of the Revised Statutes of 1874, and appears now as 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981–82 (1970). Section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as subsequently revised and amended, appears in the US Code at 18 U.S.C. §242. After the fourteenth amendment became effective, the 1866 Act was reenacted as an addendum to the Enforcement Act of 1870 in order to dispel any possible doubt as to its constitutionality. Act of May 31, 1870, ch. 114, § 18, 16 Stat. 144.

==Enactment, constitutionalization, and reenactment==

Senator Lyman Trumbull was the Senate sponsor of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and he argued that Congress had power to enact it in order to eliminate a discriminatory &quot;badge of servitude&quot; prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment. Congressman John Bingham, principal author of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment, was one of several Republicans who believed (prior to that Amendment) that Congress lacked power to pass the 1866 Act. In the 20th century, the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately adopted Trumbull&#x27;s Thirteenth Amendment rationale for congressional power to ban racial discrimination by states and by private parties, as the Thirteenth Amendment does not require a state actor.

To the extent that the Civil Rights Act of 1866 may have been intended to go beyond preventing discrimination, by conferring particular rights on all citizens, the constitutional power of Congress to do that was more questionable. For example, Representative William Lawrence argued that Congress had power to enact the statute because of the Privileges and Immunities Clause in Article IV of the original unamended Constitution, even though courts had suggested otherwise.

In any event, there is currently no consensus that the language of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 actually purports to confer any legal benefits upon white citizens. Representative Samuel Shellabarger said that it did not.

After enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 by overriding a presidential veto, some members of Congress supported the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about the constitutionality of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. Thus, the Citizenship Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment parallels citizenship language in the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and likewise the Equal Protection Clause parallels nondiscrimination language in the 1866 Act; the extent to which other clauses in the Fourteenth Amendment may have incorporated elements of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 is a matter of continuing debate.

The Fourteenth Amendment was ratified in 1868. Two years later, the 1866 Act was reenacted as Section 18 of the Enforcement Act of 1870.

==Aftermath and consequences==
After Johnson&#x27;s veto was overridden, the measure became law. Despite this victory, even some Republicans who had supported the goals of the Civil Rights Act began to doubt that Congress possessed the constitutional power to turn those goals into laws. The experience encouraged both radical and moderate Republicans to seek Constitutional guarantees for black rights, rather than relying on temporary political majorities.

The activities of groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) undermined the act, meaning that it failed to immediately secure the civil rights of African Americans.

While it has been &quot;de jure&quot; illegal in the U.S. to discriminate in employment and housing on the basis of race since 1866, federal penalties were not provided for until the second half of the 20th century (with the passage of related civil rights legislation), which meant remedies were left to the individuals involved: because those being discriminated against had limited or no access to legal assistance, this often left many victims of discrimination without recourse.

There have been an increasing number of remedies provided under this act since the second half of the 20th century, including the landmark &quot;Jones v. Mayer&quot; and &quot;Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc.&quot; decisions in 1968.

<doc id="632092" wikidata="Q736574" url="?curid=632092" title="New York State Thruway">
<text>The New York State Thruway (officially the Governor Thomas E. Dewey Thruway and colloquially &quot;the Thruway&quot;) is a system of controlled-access toll roads spanning within the U.S. state of New York. It is operated by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), a New York State public-benefit corporation. The mainline is a freeway that extends from the New York City line at Yonkers to the Pennsylvania state line at Ripley by way of I-87 and I-90 through Albany, Syracuse, and Buffalo. According to the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, the Thruway is the fifth-busiest toll road in the United States. The toll road is also a major route for long distance travelers linking the cities of Toronto, Buffalo, and Montreal with Boston and New York City.

A tolled highway connecting the major cities of New York was first proposed in 1949. The first section of the Thruway, between Lowell, New York (south of Rome) and Rochester, opened on June 24, 1954. The remainder of the mainline was opened in 1955, and many of its spurs connecting to highways in other states and the Canadian province of Ontario were built in the 1950s. In 1957, much of the Thruway system was included as portions of Interstate 87 (I-87), I-90, and I-95. Other segments became part of I-190 and I-287 shortly afterward. Today, the system comprises six highways: the New York–Ripley mainline, the Berkshire Connector, the Garden State Parkway Connector, the New England Thruway (I-95), the Niagara Thruway (I-190), and the Cross Westchester Expressway (I-287). The portion of I-84 in New York was maintained by the Thruway Authority from 1991 to 2010, but it was never part of the Thruway system and is currently maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT).

The Thruway formerly utilized a combination of closed (ticket-based), and open (barrier-based) tolling. From 2016 to 2018, all flat-rate barriers on the Thruway system transitioned to open road tolling, which replaced cash payment with an all-electronic tolling system using E-ZPass and toll by mail. On November 13, 2020, both ticket systems on the Thruway were converted to open road tolling. The Garden State Parkway Connector, the Cross Westchester Expressway and the section of the mainline in and around Buffalo are toll-free. Motorists with E-ZPasses receive a greater discount on the toll-by-mail rate than out-of-state E-ZPass members do. The Thruway is partly subsidized by the tolls, whereas other parts are subsidized by NYSDOT, a 50/50 for the toll-free areas, and cashless/tolled areas.

==Route description==
The New York State Thruway system is a collection of six individual components across the state of New York that connect the state to four neighboring states (Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania) as well as the Canadian province of Ontario. Together, the highways extend for , making the Thruway system one of the largest toll highway systems in the United States. The longest of the six components is the mainline. Of the 570 miles in the Thruway system, (98.4%) carries at least one Interstate Highway designation. Only three sections of the system are not part of the Interstate Highway System; these are the Garden State Parkway Connector in Rockland County, a portion of the Berkshire Connector between its western terminus at exit 21A on the mainline near Selkirk and where it joins up with Interstate 90 at exit B1 in Schodack, and a short section of the mainline within exit 24 in Albany that is located between where I-87 departs the roadway and I-90 enters it. They are designated as New York State Route 982L (NY 982L), NY 912M, and NY 915H, respectively, all unsigned reference routes. The speed limit, enforced by the New York State Police, is 65 miles per hour along most of the Thruway. The main exceptions to this are in the suburbs and city of Buffalo and in Westchester and Rockland counties. There, the speed limit is 55 miles per hour.

I-90, which comprises the bulk of the mainline and the Berkshire Connector, runs for along the Thruway: as part of the Berkshire Connector and on the mainline. I-87 comprises the remaining of the mainline, including an concurrency with I-287 north of New York City. I-287 covers another (including the shared with I-87), while I-190 spans and I-95 covers .

All highways maintained by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA) lack the reference markers that exist on all New York State Department of Transportation-maintained roads, as would be expected. In their place, NYSTA-controlled roadways use small, square tenth-mile markers with a white background and blue numbering. These markers differ from the white-on-green reference markers used by NYSDOT on state-maintained highways, which are high and wide and display a limited amount of mileage information on their third row.

===Mainline===
====South of Albany====
The mainline of the Thruway begins (in terms of exit numbers and mileposts) as a continuation of the Major Deegan Expressway, carrying I-87 northward into Westchester County from New York City at the border between Yonkers and the Bronx. The first few exits serve various local streets and destinations in the city. At exit 4, I-87 connects to the Cross County Parkway, an east-west parkway providing access to the Saw Mill River, Bronx River, and Hutchinson River parkways, all of which run parallel to the Thruway through Yonkers. The Hutchinson River and Bronx River parkways leave to the northeast midway through Yonkers, while the Saw Mill and Sprain Brook parkways follow the Thruway out of the city. Exit 5 connects to Central Park Avenue (NY 100) which connects towards White Plains. After that, exit 6 connects to Tuckahoe Road, connecting towards Yonkers and Bronxville. The last free exit heading northbound is exit 6A; travel farther north requires a toll payment at the Yonkers toll gantry.

After the toll, the thruway continues to exit 7, which grants access to Ardsley and Saw Mill River Road. All three highways take generally parallel tracks to Elmsford, where I-87 directly intersects the Saw Mill River Parkway at exit 7A. Not far to the north is exit 8, a semi-directional T interchange with I-287 (the Cross Westchester Expressway). I-287 joins the Thruway here, following I-87 west across the Hudson River into Rockland County on the Tappan Zee Bridge. I-87 and I-287 remain overlapped for through the densely-populated southern portion of Rockland County, meeting the Palisades Interstate Parkway (exit 13) and the Garden State Parkway Connector, the latter of which provides access to the Garden State Parkway (exit 14A) in New Jersey. The Thruway continues generally westward to Suffern, where I-87 and I-287 split at a large semi-directional T interchange (exit 15) near the New Jersey border. At this point, I-287 heads south into New Jersey while I-87 and the Thruway turn northward into the valley of the Ramapo River. NY 17 northbound briefly joins the Thruway at the interchange with I-287 in Suffern, and leaves the Thruway a half-mile north at exit 15A in Hillburn.

The Thruway continues north through the river valley toward Harriman, where it encounters the Woodbury toll gantry, the southeastern end of the mainline&#x27;s major closed toll system. The gantry is located on the mainline within exit 16 (NY 17), a trumpet interchange. Along with the mainline gantry in Harriman, an toll plaza]] exists on future I-86 midway between the Thruway and NY 17. Now a completely tolled highway, the Thruway heads northward, roughly paralleling the Hudson River to the river&#x27;s west as it serves the city of Newburgh, the village of New Paltz, and the city of Kingston, connecting to the short I-587 in the latter.

Past Kingston, the highway runs closer to the river as it parallels U.S. Route 9W (US 9W) through the towns of Saugerties, Catskill, Coxsackie, and Ravena. Just north of Ravena, the Thruway meets the west end of the Berkshire Connector, a spur linking the Thruway mainline to the Massachusetts Turnpike to the east. The highway continues into Albany, where it connects to Troy via I-787 at exit 23 and intersects I-90 at exit 24. The latter of the two junctions is the busiest of the Thruway&#x27;s exits, serving an estimated 27 million vehicles a year. I-87 leaves the Thruway mainline here, and the Thruway briefly becomes the unsigned reference route NY 915H, before I-90 merges into it, following the Thruway northwestward toward Schenectady.

====Albany to Syracuse====
South of Schenectady, but still in Albany County, the Thruway and I-90 meet I-890, a loop route of I-90 that directly serves the downtown district of Schenectady, at exit 25. The Thruway, meanwhile, bypasses the city to the south and west, intersecting I-88 at exit 25A in Rotterdam before reuniting with I-890 at exit 26 west of Scotia. Travel between I-88 (Exit 25A) and exits 24, 25, and 26 in either direction is toll-free. From exit 26 west to Utica, the mainline of the Thruway parallels the Erie Canal and the Mohawk River, crossing over the water-bodies at Mohawk. In between Schenectady and Utica, I-90 and the Thruway serve several riverside communities, including the cities of Amsterdam (exit 27 via NY 30) and Little Falls (exit 29A, NY 169) and the villages of Fonda (exit 28, NY 30A), Canajoharie (exit 29, NY 5S and NY 10), and Herkimer (exit 30, NY 28).

Like Schenectady before it, the Thruway bypasses downtown Utica, following an alignment north of the city while I-790 serves it directly. I-790 breaks from the Thruway at exit 31 and runs along two carriageways flanking the mainline on both sides for before turning southward onto the North-South Arterial. The adjacent highways become NY 49, which parallels the Thruway for another northwestward. At the end of this stretch, the Thruway turns slightly southwestward, crossing over the Mohawk River and the Erie Canal while NY 49 continues northwestward along the northern bank of the water-bodies toward Rome. On the other side of the river, the Thruway curves back to the west, proceeding to exit 32 in Westmoreland.

Not far to the west, the Thruway has a junction with NY 365 at exit 33 in Verona. Here, the Thruway connects to the cities of Rome and Oneida and serves the Turning Stone Resort &amp; Casino via NY 365. The highway continues onward through a sparsely-populated area between Verona and Syracuse, passing roughly south of Oneida Lake as it connects to the village of Canastota by way of NY 13 at exit 34. As the highway approaches exit 34A (I-481) outside of Syracuse, the surroundings become more developed. The level of development rises sharply west of I-481 as the Thruway enters Salina, a northern suburb of Syracuse. Within Salina, I-90 and the Thruway intersect I-81, which connects the Thruway to both downtown Syracuse and Syracuse Hancock International Airport.

====Syracuse to Buffalo====
West of Salina, the Thruway passes north of Liverpool and Onondaga Lake before intersecting I-690 and its northern continuation, NY 690, at exit 39 in Van Buren. At this point, the amount of development along the Thruway sharply declines as it heads generally westward through a marshy area of Onondaga County. I-90 and the Thruway reconnect to the Erie Canal (here part of the Seneca River) at the western county line. Now in Cayuga County, the highway serves Weedsport via exit 40 and NY 34, exit 41 serving Del Lago Resort and Casino in Tyre, New York and passes north of Port Byron prior to entering Seneca County and the Montezuma National Wildlife Refuge. Here, the canal leaves the Thruway for good, turning northwestward to follow the NY 31 corridor to Rochester and beyond.

The portion of the Thruway between Montezuma and the Rochester area is one of mostly rural nature, with the highway passing through remote, open fields, and for the most part avoiding highly populated areas. Along this stretch, it connects to two cities, both located well to the south of the Thruway: Geneva by way of exit 42 for NY 14 and Canandaigua by way of exit 43 via NY 21. The next exit along the highway, exit 44 for NY 332, also serves Canandaigua; the junction is the primary exit for Canandaigua-bound travelers from the Rochester area. Here, the Thruway temporarily widens from four to six lanes as it continues generally westward to meet I-490 at exit 45 near Victor. As in the vicinity of Schenectady and Utica, an auxiliary route of I-90here I-490directly serves a city (Rochester) while the Thruway bypasses it.

It heads northwestward through the city&#x27;s southern, mostly rural suburbs to Henrietta, where it meets I-390 at exit 46. Henrietta is as close as the Thruway gets to downtown as it proceeds west to Le Roy, where I-490 reconnects to I-90 at exit 47. I-90 continues onward into Genesee County, intersecting with NY 98 at exit 48 north of Batavia and NY 77 at exit 48A in Pembroke. The latter exit provides access to Six Flags Darien Lake, a large amusement park located in the town of Darien. I-90 and the Thruway continue into Erie County and the Buffalo area. It meets NY 78 at exit 49 near Depew before passing through the Williamsville toll gantry, the northwestern end of the major closed toll system.

====West of Buffalo====
Just west of the toll gantry, I-90 and the Thruway—now toll-free—connect to I-290 via exit 50, a semi-directional T interchange. At this point, the Thruway turns southward, passing through the immediate eastern suburbs of Buffalo. As it heads south, it meets the Kensington Expressway (NY 33) at exit 51 and Walden Avenue at exit 52, both cloverleaf interchanges. At exit 52, it passes to the west of the Walden Galleria, a shopping mall situated at the nearby junction of Walden Avenue and NY 277. Two exits later in southern Cheektowaga, I-90 meets I-190, a spur route leading to downtown Buffalo and Niagara Falls, at exit 53.

South of the city, the Thruway meets the Aurora Expressway (NY 400) and the Southern Expressway (US 219) at exits 54 and 55, respectively, in West Seneca. Just southwest of exit 55, I-90 and the Thruway pass through the Lackawanna toll gantry, which serves as the northeast end of the minor closed toll system. Once again a toll road, the Thruway heads southwestward, roughly paralleling the shoreline of Lake Erie to Blasdell, where it connects to NY 179 (the Milestrip Expressway). Farther southwestward, the Thruway is joined by US 20, which follows a parallel routing to that of the Thruway to the Pennsylvania state line.

As the route passes from Erie County to Chautauqua County, the last on its routing, it cuts through the northwestern portion of the Cattaraugus Indian Reservation, situated on Cattaraugus Creek. The Thruway continues alongside US 20 past Dunkirk and Westfield to the Ripley toll gantry, the southwestern end of the minor closed toll system just northeast of exit 61 for Shortman Road. Travelers heading eastbound from Pennsylvania can access Shortman Road toll-free. The Thruway ends about after exit 61 at the Pennsylvania state line. I-90, however, continues onward into Pennsylvania as a toll-free highway.

===Berkshire Connector===
The Berkshire Connector is a east–west spur connecting the Thruway mainline in Coeymans to the Massachusetts Turnpike at the Massachusetts state line in Canaan. It is tolled as part of the closed toll system in place on the mainline between exits 16 and 50. The highway begins at exit 21A off the Thruway southwest of Selkirk in the town of Coeymans (south of Albany) as NY 912M, an unsigned reference route. It proceeds eastward over the Hudson River and into Rensselaer County by way of the Castleton Bridge. It navigates through the southern, rural portion of the county to exit B1 in Schodack, where the connector meets I-90. The unsigned NY 912M designation terminates here while I-90 joins the Berkshire Connector and follows the spur east into Columbia County.

While the Rensselaer County segment follows a mostly east–west routing, the Berkshire Connector in Columbia County takes on a northwest-southeast alignment as the roadway heads towards exit B2 in East Chatham. The junction serves as the northern terminus of the Taconic State Parkway, which connects the spur to the New York City area. About to the southeast is the Canaan toll gantry, which marks the end of the Thruway ticket system. The last exit on the Berkshire Connector is exit B3 for NY 22 just west of the Massachusetts state line in Canaan. The spur continues east to the state line, where it becomes the Massachusetts Turnpike.

===Garden State Parkway Connector===

The Garden State Parkway Connector is a highway that connects the Thruway mainline at exit 14A in Ramapo with the Garden State Parkway at the New Jersey state line. It is designated as NY 982L, an unsigned reference route. The highway begins, in terms of mileposts, at Thruway (I-87 and I-287) exit 14A in Ramapo and heads generally southwestward as a toll-free highway toward the state line. Just north of the state line, the southbound connector meets Red Schoolhouse Road (County Route 41 or CR 41) at a partial diamond interchange. All southbound trucks are forced to exit here, as the Garden State Parkway prohibits trucks north of exit 105. Thus, the final of the road south of the Red Schoolhouse Road exit is the only part of the Thruway system that prohibits trucks. The connector continues to the state line, where it becomes the tolled Garden State Parkway.

===Other components===

The New York State Thruway system also consists of three other components: the New England Thruway, the Cross Westchester Expressway, and the Niagara Thruway. The New England Thruway (NET) is a section of Interstate 95 under the operation and maintenance of the New York State Thruway Authority. It begins at the Pelham Parkway interchange (exit 8) in the Co-op City section of the Bronx and continues northeastward into Westchester County to the Connecticut state line, where it connects to the Connecticut Turnpike. The Cross Westchester Expressway, part of I-287, begins at I-87 exit 8 in Elmsford, where I-287 splits from the Thruway mainline, and travels east across Westchester County to I-95, with connections to both the New England Thruway and the Connecticut Turnpike at exit 12 in Rye. The Niagara Thruway comprises the first of I-190 from I-90 in Buffalo to NY 384 in Niagara Falls.

==History==
A toll superhighway connecting the major cities of the state of New York that would become part of a larger nationwide highway network was proposed as early as 1949. The following year, the New York State Legislature passed the Thruway Authority Act creating the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), an independent public corporation, which would build and manage the Thruway. The project was to be financed through toll revenue bonds and self-liquidating by receipt of tolls, rents, concessions, and other income. The act also stipulated NYSTA adopt a hybrid system of tolls, with barrier tolls collected in urban areas, and long-distance tickets issued in rural areas.

The first section of Thruway, a 115-mile stretch from Lowell to Rochester, opened on June 24, 1954. Other sections of the mainline between Buffalo and the Bronx were completed and opened throughout 1954 and 1955. The last segment, from Yonkers south to the Bronx, was completed on August 31, 1956. The total cost was $600 million (equivalent to $ in ), financed by the sale of $972 million in bonds (equivalent to $ in ). At the time, it was the longest toll road in the world. In 1957, the mainline was extended west from Buffalo along Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania state line.

From 1957 to 1960, several spurs of the road were built to connect the road to turnpikes in adjacent states. These include the Berkshire Connector (May 26, 1959), which connects to the Massachusetts Turnpike, the New England Thruway (October 31, 1958) and Cross Westchester Expressway (December 1, 1960), which both connect to the Connecticut Turnpike, and the Niagara Thruway (July 30, 1959), which connects to Canada&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Way via a border crossing near Niagara Falls. The Thruway also directly connects to New Jersey&#x27;s tolled Garden State Parkway, which eventually connects to the New Jersey Turnpike, which is part of a toll road system linking New York City and Chicago that also uses tolled highways in Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Indiana.

On August 14, 1957, the segment of the mainline between the Pennsylvania border and the Adirondack Northway in Albany became part of I-90 while the portions from the Northway south to Newburgh and from Elmsford south to the New York City line were included in I-87. Between Elmsford and Newburgh, I-87 followed I-287, what is now I-684, and I-84. Upon its completion, the Berkshire Connector east of US 9 also became part of I-90, creating a gap in the I-90 designation around Albany until the completion of the Albany-Schodack Freeway in the early 1970s, which is not part of the Thruway system. The entirety of the New England Thruway became part of I-95 upon completion while the Niagara Thruway became I-90N in 1957 when it was built through downtown Buffalo, and later I-190 in 1959 upon completion. The Elmsford–Suffern section of the mainline was designated as part of I-287 upon completion of the Cross Westchester Expressway (also I-287) in 1960.

The highway was distinctive in that original signage utilized dark blue backgrounds, the same color blue as displayed on the New York state flag. Over time, these signs were replaced with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA)-approved green backgrounds.

On September 1, 1964, the New York State Legislature officially renamed the Thruway in honor of Thomas E. Dewey, the Governor of New York at the time of the Thruway&#x27;s opening. The official designation is, however, rarely used in reference to the road.

The last section of the mainline to receive a designation—from Suffern to Newburgh—finally received one on January 1, 1970, when I-87 was realigned to follow the Thruway for its entire length south of Albany and the former portion of I-87 between White Plains and Brewster became I-684.

On February 28, 1974, exit 14B was opened.

The closed-toll (originally ticket) system originally began at Spring Valley but was moved to Woodbury on March 3, 1974, allowing interchanges along the Thruway in Rockland County to be free of tolls. The Suffern toll plaza was demolished soon after this change. 

In 1984, the New Rochelle toll barrier was widened by four booths.

The Schoharie Creek Bridge was a Thruway bridge over the Schoharie Creek near Fort Hunter and the Mohawk River. On April 5, 1987, it collapsed due to bridge scour at the foundations after a record rainfall. At the time of the collapse, one car and one tractor-semitrailer were on the bridge. Before the road could be blocked off, three more cars drove into the gap. The collapse killed ten people. The replacement bridge was completed and fully open to traffic on May 21, 1988.

In 1994, exit 5 was rebuilt, replacing the original trumpet interchange with a more complex configuration. Part of the old interchange was not enitrly demloished however.

The Spring Vallery barrier&#x27;s car toll was removed in July 1997. At the time, the toll was $0.40 (equivalent to $ in ).

In August 1993, NYSTA became the first agency to implement the E-ZPass electronic toll collection system. By December 1996, it was implemented at all of the Thruway&#x27;s fixed-toll barriers and at exits along the Berkshire Connector and the New York City–Buffalo section of the mainline. E-ZPass was installed at all of the mainline exits by March 1998.

In 1999, NYSDOT, the Federal Highway Administration and NYSTA discussed making the entire Berkshire Connector part of I-90 and redesignating the non-toll part of I-90 from Thruway exit 24 to exit B1 as I-88. The Thruway main line would be designated as both I-90 and I-88 between exits 25A and 24, and as I-90 and I-87 from exit 24 to exit 21A. This was never implemented, as the FHWA wished to preserve the I-88 numbering for a potential future corridor connecting Albany and northern interior New England.

When I-84 was built through the Newburgh area in the early 1960s, no interchange was built between I-84 and the Thruway. Instead, the connection was made via a short segment of NY 300, which both I-84 and I-87 meet via interchanges. Construction on a direct connection between the Thruway mainline and I-84 began in August 2003. The portion of the exit carrying traffic from I-84 to the Thruway was opened in July 2009. The opposite direction was opened two months later on September 23. The connection allows cars to travel between I-87, I-84 and NY 300 via splits in the ramp.

On May 14, 2010, a new E-ZPass configuration, consisting of two highway speed E-ZPass lanes in each direction, became operational at the Woodbury toll plaza, with concrete barriers separating the faster traffic from the staffed toll lanes necessary for vehicles not equipped for E-ZPass.

The original Tappan Zee Bridge, carrying the concurrency of the New York State Thruway, I-87, and I-287, was a cantilever bridge built during 1952–55. The bridge was long and spanned the Hudson at its second-widest point. Before its replacement in 2017, the deteriorating structure carried an average of 138,000 vehicles per day, substantially more traffic than its design capacity. During its first decade, the bridge carried fewer than 40,000 vehicles per day. Part of the justification for replacing the bridge stems from its construction immediately following the Korean War on a low budget of only $81 million. Unlike other major bridges in metropolitan New York, the Tappan Zee was designed only to last 50 years. The Federal Highway Administration issued a report in October 2011 designating the Tappan Zee&#x27;s replacement to be a dual-span twin bridge. Construction officially began in October 2013, with the new spans being built to the north of the existing bridge. The new bridge connects to the existing highway approaches of I-87 and I-287 on both river banks. The northbound/westbound span opened on August 25, 2017. Southbound/eastbound traffic remained on the old bridge until October 6, 2017. At that point, southbound/eastbound traffic shifted to the westbound span of the new bridge and the old bridge closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;S/E traffic shifted&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The bridge&#x27;s eastbound span opened to traffic on September 11, 2018. Upon completion, the new Tappan Zee Bridge became one of the longest cable-stayed spans in the nation.

In late 2018, ramp meters were installed on all entrance ramps to the Thruway mainline in Westchester County (exits 1-9) and at all entrances to the entire Cross Westchester Expressway. Ramp meters were activated at exits 11, 12, and 13 in October 2020.

On April 23, 2016, the southbound toll plaza at the Tappan Zee Bridge in Westchester County was closed and replaced with a southbound all-electronic toll gantry on the Rockland County side of the bridge. In late 2018, all remaining flat-rate toll barriers on the Thruway were replaced with electronic toll gantries. In October 2020, it was announced that the transition to cashless tolls would go into effect the following month, which would eliminate all toll booths and their operators. On November 12, 2020, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the entire Thruway would transition to cashless tolling. Tolls on the entire Thruway became completely cashless two days later. The cashless tolling project cost $355 million.

==Services==

There are 27 service areas along the Thruway, all on the New York–Ripley mainline. The service areas, called &quot;travel plazas&quot; by the New York State Thruway Authority (NYSTA), are spaced roughly apart and are open at all hours of the day. Two plazas—the New Baltimore plaza at milepost 127 and the Angola plaza at milepost 447—are accessible from both directions of the Thruway; the remainder are accessible from only one direction (although the Sloatsburg and Ramapo service plazas at milepost 33 were connected via a pedestrian bridge until 2021). Each plaza features a gas station and a variety of restaurants, at least one of which is open 24 hours. Free Wi-Fi service was added to all 27 service areas on March 1, 2007.

NYSTA also operates the Thruway Authority Highway Advisory Radio (HAR) system, a network of radio stations across the state that broadcast information on traffic conditions along the Thruway. The system broadcasts at 1610 AM in the Rochester, Albany, Kingston, and Newburgh areas, 1620 AM in the Finger Lakes and Syracuse areas, 1630 AM near Buffalo, and 530 AM in the New York City metropolitan area. HAR is also used to broadcast Amber/Silver Alerts if one is issued.

As of August 9, 2023, a check of the FCC&#x27;s Universal Licensing System (ULS) shows that all of the Highway Advisory Radio stations licensed to the New York State Thruway Authority show a status of &quot;Expired&quot; or &quot;Cancelled&quot;.

The New York Thruway Travel Plazas started a redesign and redevelopment program in the middle of 2021. This project is expected to be completed in two phases with one completed in 2023 and the other in 2025. The operators of the rest stops are Empire State Thruway Partners. They plan to include several restaurant options. 

=== Travel plazas ===
==Tolls==
All components of the New York State Thruway system except for the Garden State Parkway Connector and the Cross Westchester Expressway are tolled in some capacity. The entire Thruway has used an all-electronic, open road tolling system since November 14, 2020, with tolls being collected by E-ZPass or Tolls by Mail. Seventy electronic toll gantries comprise the Thruway toll system.

, drivers with out-of-state issued E-ZPass transponders pay 15% more than drivers with transponders issued by the New York Customer Service Center. Tolls by Mail rates are 30% higher than New York E-ZPass rates. Tolls by Mail drivers pay an additional fee when receiving their invoice.

=== Component toll sections ===
There are three types of toll sections on the Thruway: closed-toll segments, flat-rate highway gantry segments, and flat-rate bridge/barrier gantry segments. On the closed-toll segments, a driver is electronically recorded when they enter and pay a distance-based toll upon exit. The highway gantry segments are situated between closed-toll segments and are spaced so they require a toll to travel between any pair of exits on each segment. Finally, the barrier/bridge gantries generally contain free exits on either side of the gantry.

==== Closed-toll segments and highway gantries ====
Prior to the implementation of electronic tolling, the longer of the two closed-toll systems began at Woodbury and extended from NY 17 to just east of exit 50 in Williamsville. The Berkshire Connector was enclosed within this system, so traveling between the mainline and the connector via exit 21A did not involve crossing an electronic toll gantry. Under the old ticket system, the connector&#x27;s exits up to the toll barrier at exit B3 were listed with the mainline exits on tickets for the major closed system. The other system encompassed the portion of the mainline between exit 55 in Lackawanna and exit 61 near the Pennsylvania state line.

Similar to the old system, any travel between exits 15A and 50 and between exits 55 and 61 requires paying a toll, but a mixture of closed-toll segments and fixed-toll gantries are used. There are six closed-toll segments on the Thruway, which are numbered 1 through 6. Within each closed-toll segment, there are highway gantries on the mainline Thruway before the respective start and end of each segment, as well as on the entrance and exit ramps of all interchanges between each of these highway gantries. Cameras or E-ZPass readers record vehicles entering each segment, and a distance-based toll is calculated when vehicles leave that segment. Segments 1 through 5 cover the exits in the old closed-toll system from Woodbury to Williamsville, while segment 6 comprises the shorter system from Lackawanna to Ripley. The segments are as follows:

* Segment 1: exits 50 to 47
* Segment 2: exits 44 to 39
* Segment 3: exits 39 to 36
* Segment 4: exits 34A to 25A
* Segment 5: exits 23 to 15A and the Berkshire Connector (tolls from southbound drivers entering at exit 16 and northbound drivers leaving at exit 16 are flat-rate; see )
* Segment 6: exits 61 to 55

The eight fixed-rate segment highway gantries are all located between the closed-toll (distance-based) segments. Unlike at the closed-toll segments, a single fixed-rate toll is paid when traveling between adjacent exits, but motorists driving for longer distances pay multiple tolls. These eight toll points on the highway took the place of toll plazas at the adjacent exits, therefore these exits do not need or have their own toll gantries. There was no corresponding old toll point (barrier plaza) on the highway before November 2020, where this class of gantry now stands, since the plazas were at the exits. Also, when the plazas were at the exits, rather than being fixed-rate, there was a distance-based toll, using tickets or being electronically recorded using E-ZPass. The locations on the highway of this class of toll gantry are as follows:

* Three gantries between exits 47 and 44
* Two gantries between exits 36 and 34A
* Three gantries between exits 25A and 23

==== Standalone fixed toll gantries ====
This class of toll gantry on the Thruway system replaced former fixed-rate toll barrier plazas located at bridges and other locations. These particular toll points are their own class because they are not considered segments of the distance-based toll system (former ticket systems), unlike fixed-rate segment highway gantries which are situated between distance-based toll segments. These toll points were made cashless (changed from plazas to gantries) first, from 2016 to 2018, contrasted with fixed-rate segment highway gantries, which were established for tolling in November 2020, when cashless tolling went live on the ticket systems of the Thruway. Even before cashless tolling, which brought more segmentation and the other class of fixed-rate toll point, these toll points were considered standalone due to being outside the ticket systems. This class of toll gantry, and the toll barriers that existed before, are subject to conditions such as direction of travel and not being covered by the E-ZPass annual permit plan.

On the mainline Thruway, there are three flat-rate bridge/barrier gantries. The southernmost of these is in Yonkers, where there is a bi-directional gantry between exits 6A and 7. In South Nyack, there is a southbound-only toll gantry for the Tappan Zee Bridge. Lastly, there is a northbound, commercial traffic-only gantry between exits 14A and 14B near Spring Valley.

The Harriman toll gantry at exit 16 is also a barrier/bridge gantry; it is right next to the Woodbury toll gantry, which forms the southern end of closed-tolling segment 5. The Harriman toll gantry is used by traffic entering the southbound Thruway from future I-86, as well as traffic on the northbound Thruway exiting to future I-86. Traffic entering or continuing on the northbound Thruway, as well as traffic from the southbound Thruway that is exiting or continuing south, use the Woodbury toll gantry. The ticket on the former ticketed system was identical to that given for exit 15A with the exception that the toll for exit 16 is subtracted from all of the prices. To distinguish between exit 16 and the Woodbury toll barrier, Thruway tickets listed the NY 17 interchange as exit 16 and the Woodbury toll plaza as exit 15, although the actual exit 15 is situated almost to the south.

The other components of the system that are tolled have far fewer tolls. On the New England Thruway (I-95), there is a fixed-rate electronic toll gantry on I-95 northbound between exits 16 and 17 in New Rochelle. Meanwhile, the only tolls along the Niagara Thruway (I-190) are those for the North and South Grand Island Bridges.

===Cost===
When the Thruway opened in the mid-1950s, the cost to travel from Buffalo to New York City was $5.60 (equivalent to $ in ). The closed ticket system, which at the time extended from Spring Valley to Williamsville, accounted for $5 of the toll, while the remaining $0.60 was charged at the Yonkers ($0.10) and Tappan Zee ($0.50) toll barriers. After the south end of the major closed ticket system was moved from Spring Valley to Woodbury, the Spring Valley toll barrier became a fixed-rate toll for both cars and trucks. As of August 2021, the trip from Buffalo to the New York City line costs $31.04 with toll-by-plate ($23.87 for New York E-ZPass holders) with two-axle passenger vehicles, calculated at 15 gantries and tolling sections. The return trip costs $24.21 ($18.62 with New York E-ZPass) across 14 gantries and tolling sections, as the Tappan Zee Bridge gantry only charges a southbound/eastbound toll.

As of August 2021, the Berkshire Connector costs $1.03 ($0.79 with New York E-ZPass) to travel between the Massachusetts state line and exit B1. Tolls west of exit B1 vary based on which direction a motorist travels on I-87. The toll on the minor closed ticket system from Pennsylvania to exit 55 south of Buffalo is $3.87 ($2.97 with New York E-ZPass). The Grand Island Bridges on I-190 cost $1.24 to cross ($0.95 with New York E-ZPass) while the New Rochelle toll gantry on I-95 costs $2.16 ($1.66 with New York E-ZPass). The Black Rock and City Line toll barriers on the Niagara Thruway in Buffalo charged $0.75 at the time of their removal on October 30, 2006.

All tolls along the Thruway were supposed to be abolished when the construction bonds used to build it had been paid off. The last of the bonds was paid off in 1996; however, the tolls remained in place after the New York State Legislature transferred ownership of the New York State Canal System to NYSTA in 1992.

==Exit list==
For exits on the Cross Westchester Expressway, the New England Thruway, or the Niagara Thruway, see the articles on those highways.

Unlike many interstate highways, exits are identified by a number in ascending sequence, rather than by their mileage (distance) markers, starting with exit 1 on the east, just outside New York City, and ending with exit 61 on the west, near the Pennsylvania state line.

<text>The Transcendental Meditation movement (TM) are programs and organizations that promote the Transcendental Meditation technique founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in India in the 1950s. The organization was estimated to have 900,000 participants in 1977, a million by the 1980s, and 5 million in more recent years.

Programs include the Transcendental Meditation technique, an advanced meditation practice called the TM-Sidhi program (&quot;Yogic Flying&quot;), an alternative health care program called Maharishi Ayurveda, and a system of building and architecture called Maharishi Sthapatya Ved. The TM movement&#x27;s past and present media endeavors include a publishing company (MUM Press), a television station (KSCI), a radio station (KHOE), and a satellite television channel (Maharishi Channel). Its products and services have been offered primarily through nonprofit and educational outlets, such as the Global Country of World Peace, and the David Lynch Foundation.

The TM movement also operates a worldwide network of Transcendental Meditation teaching centers, schools, universities, health centers, and herbal supplement, solar panel, and home financing companies, plus several TM-centered communities. The global organization is reported to have an estimated net worth of USD 3.5 billion.

The TM movement has been called a spiritual movement, a new religious movement, a millenarian movement, a world affirming movement, a new social movement, a guru-centered movement, a personal growth movement, and a cult. TM is practiced by people from a diverse group of religious affiliations.

==History==
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi began teaching Transcendental Meditation in India in the late 1950s. The Maharishi began a series of world tours in 1958 to promote his meditation technique. The resulting publicity generated by the Maharishi, the celebrities who learned the technique and the scientific research into its effect, helped popularize the technique in the 1960s and 1970s. In the 1970s the Maharishi introduced advanced meditative techniques and his movement grew to encompass TM programs for schools, universities and prisons. In the 1980s additional programs aimed at improved health and well-being were developed based on the Maharishi&#x27;s interpretation of the Vedic traditions. By the late 2000s, TM had been taught to millions of individuals and the Maharishi oversaw a large multinational movement which has continued since his death in 2008. The Maharishi&#x27;s obituary in the &quot;New York Times&quot; credited the TM movement as being &quot;a founding influence on what has grown into a multibillion-dollar self-help industry&quot;.

==Practitioners and participants==
The TM movement has been described as a &quot;global movement&quot; that utilizes its own international policies and transports its &quot;core members&quot; from country to country. It does not seek to interfere with its member&#x27;s involvement in their various religions.

In 2008, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reported that TM&#x27;s &quot;public interest&quot; had continued to grow in the 1970s&quot; however, some practitioners were discouraged &quot;by the organization&#x27;s promotion of ...Yogic Flying.&quot; The organization was estimated to have 900,000 participants worldwide in 1977 according to new religious movement scholars Stark, Bainbridge and Sims. That year the TM movement said there were 394 TM centers in the U.S., that about half of the 8,000 trained TM teachers were still active, and that one million Americans had been taught the technique. The movement was reported to have a million participants by the 1980s, and modern day estimates range between four and ten million practitioners worldwide. As of 1998, the country with the largest percentage of TM practitioners was Israel, where 50,000 people had learned the technique since its introduction in the 1960s, according members of the TM movement. In 2008, the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; reported that an estimated 200,000 Britons practiced TM.

The TM movement has a flexible structure that allows varying degrees of commitment. Many are satisfied with their &quot;independent practice of TM&quot; and don&#x27;t seek any further involvement with the organization. For many TM practitioners their meditation is &quot;one of many New Age products that they consume.&quot; Other practitioners are &quot;dedicated&quot; but are also critical of the organization. Still others, are &quot;highly devoted&quot; and participate in &quot;mass meditations&quot; at Maharishi University of Management, perform administrative activities or engage in a monastic lifestyle. Likewise the organization has a &quot;loose organisational hierarchy&quot;. Transcendental Meditators who participate in group meditations at Maharishi University of Management are referred to as &quot;Citizens of the Age of Enlightenment&quot;. Regional leaders and &quot;leading Transcendental Meditators&quot; trained as TM teachers and graduates of the TM-Sidhi program are called &quot;Governors of the Age of Enlightenment&quot;. There are also &quot;national leaders&quot; and &quot;top officials&quot; of the &quot;World Peace Government&quot; that are called Rajas.

===Notable practitioners===
Notable practitioners include politicians John Hagelin and Joaquim Chissano; musicians Donovan, The Beatles, Sky Ferreira, and Mike Love; celebrities David Lynch, Clint Eastwood, Mia Farrow, Howard Stern, Doug Henning; and artist Ned Bittinger. Practitioners who became spiritual teachers or self-help authors include Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, Deepak Chopra, John Gray and Barbara De Angelis.

TM-initiated celebrities include Gwyneth Paltrow, Ellen DeGeneres, Russell Simmons, Katy Perry, Susan Sarandon, Candy Crowley, Soledad O’Brien, George Stephanopoulos, and Paul McCartney&#x27;s grandchildren. As of 2013, Jerry Seinfeld had been practicing TM for over 40 years.

Oprah Winfrey and Dr. Oz dedicated an entire show to TM.

==Programs==

===Transcendental Meditation===
The Transcendental Meditation technique is a specific form of mantra meditation developed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. It is often referred to as Transcendental Meditation or simply, TM. The meditation practice involves the use of a mantra, and is practiced for 15–20 minutes twice per day, while sitting with closed eyes. It is reported to be one of the most widely practiced, and among the most widely researched, meditation techniques, with hundreds of studies published. The technique is made available worldwide by certified TM teachers in a seven step course and fees vary from country to country. Beginning in 1965, the Transcendental Meditation technique has been incorporated into selected schools, universities, corporations and prison programs in the United States, Latin America, Europe, and India. In 1977, the TM technique and the Science of Creative Intelligence were deemed religious activities as taught in two New Jersey public schools. Subsequently the TM technique has received some governmental support.

The Transcendental Meditation technique has been described as both religious and non religious. The technique has been described in various ways including as an aspect of a New Religious Movement, as rooted in Hinduism, and as a non-religious practice for self development. The public presentation of the TM technique over its 50-year history has been praised for its high visibility in the mass media and effective global propagation, and criticized for using celebrity and scientific endorsements as a marketing tool. Advanced courses supplement the TM technique and include an advanced meditation called the TM-Sidhi program. In 1970, the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) became the theoretical basis for the Transcendental Meditation technique, although skeptics questioned its scientific nature. According to proponents, when 1 percent of a population (such as a city or country) practices the TM technique daily, their practice influences the quality of life for that population. This has been termed the Maharishi Effect.

====TM technique in education====

Transcendental Meditation in education (also known as Consciousness Based Education) is the application of the Transcendental Meditation technique in an educational setting or institution. These educational programs and institutions have been founded in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, India, Africa and Japan. The Transcendental Meditation technique became popular with students in the 1960s and by the early 1970s centers for the Students International Meditation Society were established at a thousand campuses in the United States, with similar growth occurring in Germany, Canada and Britain. The Maharishi International University was established in 1973 in the United States and began offering accredited, degree programs. In 1977 courses in Transcendental Meditation and the Science of Creative Intelligence (SCI) were legally prohibited from New Jersey (US) public high schools on religious grounds by virtue of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. This &quot;dismantled&quot; the TM program&#x27;s use of government funding in U.S. public schools but did not render &quot;a negative evaluation of the program itself&quot;. Since 1979, schools that incorporate the Transcendental Meditation technique using private, non-governmental funding have been reported in the United States, South America, Southeast Asia, Northern Ireland, South Africa and Israel.
A number of educational institutions have been founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the Transcendental Meditation movement and its supporters. These institutions include several schools offering public and private secondary education in the United States (Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment), England (Maharishi School), Australia, South Africa (Maharishi Invincibility School of Management), and India (Maharishi Vidya Mandir Schools). Likewise, Maharishi colleges and universities have been established including Maharishi European Research University (Netherlands), Maharishi Institute of Management (India), Maharishi Institute of Management (India), Maharishi University of Management and Technology (India), Maharishi Institute (South Africa) and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Vedic University (India). In the United States, critics have called Transcendental Meditation a revised form of Eastern, religious philosophy and opposed its use in public schools while a member of the Pacific Justice Institute says practicing Transcendental Meditation in public schools with private funding is constitutional.

===TM-Sidhi program===

The TM-Sidhi program is a form of meditation introduced by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1975. It is based on, and described as a natural extension of the Transcendental Meditation technique (TM). The goal of the TM-Sidhi program is to enhance mind-body coordination and to support the &quot;holistic development of consciousness&quot; by training the mind to think from what the Maharishi called a fourth state of consciousness. &quot;Yogic Flying&quot;, a mental-physical exercise of hopping while cross-legged, is a central aspect of the TM-Sidhi program. The TM website says that &quot;research has shown a dramatic and immediate reduction in societal stress, crime, violence, and conflict—and an increase in coherence, positivity, and peace in society as a whole&quot; when the TM-Sidhi program is practiced in groups. This is termed the Maharishi Effect. While empirical studies have been published in peer-reviewed academic journals they have been met with both skepticism and criticism. Skeptics have called TM&#x27;s associated theories of the Science of Creative Intelligence and the Maharishi Effect, &quot;pseudoscience&quot;. It is difficult to determine definitive effects of meditation practices in healthcare as the quality of research has design limitations and a lack of methodological rigor.

===Maharishi Ayurveda===

Maharishi Ayurveda, also known as Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health and Maharishi Vedic Medicine is considered an alternative medicine designed as a complementary system to modern western medicine. The approach was founded internationally in the mid 1980s by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The Maharishi&#x27;s revised system of Ayurveda was endorsed by the &quot;All India Ayurvedic Congress&quot; in 1997. The Transcendental Meditation technique is part of the Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health (MVAH).
According to the movement&#x27;s Global Good News website, there are 23 Maharishi Vedic Health Centres in 16 countries, including Austria, France, Denmark, Germany, India, Israel, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. The Maharishi Ayurvedic Centre in Skelmersdale, UK also offers panchakarma detoxification.

===Maharishi Sthapatya Veda===
Maharishi Sthapatya Veda (MSV) is a set of architectural and planning principles assembled by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi based on &quot;ancient Sanskrit texts&quot; as well as Vastu Shastra, the Hindu science of architecture. Maharishi Sthapatya Veda architecture is also called &quot;Maharishi Vastu&quot; architecture, &quot;Fortune-Creating&quot; buildings and homes, and &quot;Maharishi Vedic architecture&quot;. According to its self-description, the system consists of &quot;precise mathematical formulas, equations, and proportions&quot; for architectural design and construction. MSV has strict rules governing the orientation and proportions of a building. The most important factor is the entrance, which must be either due east or due north. The MSV architect also considers the slope and shape of the lot, exposure to the rising sun, location of nearby bodies of water and the other buildings or activities in the nearby environment. MSV emphasizes the use of natural or &quot;green&quot; building materials. The TM movement&#x27;s aspiration is to have global reconstruction to create east-facing entrances, at an estimated cost of $300 trillion.

====Settlements====

About 3,000 TM practitioners are estimated to live near MUM and the Golden Domes in Fairfield, Iowa, US, an area dubbed &quot;Silicorn Valley&quot; by locals. By 2001, Fairfield&#x27;s mayor and some city council members were TM practitioners. Just outside the city limits is Maharishi Vedic City. The city&#x27;s 2010 population of 1,294 includes about 1,000 pandits from India who live on a special campus. The city plan and buildings are based on Maharishi Sthapatya Veda, an ancient system of architecture and design revived by the Maharishi.

A community called Sidhadorp was established in the Netherlands in 1979 and reached its completion in 1985. Around the same time Sidhaland, in Skelmersdale UK was established with about 400 TM practitioners, a meditation dome, and a TM school. There is also a housing project in Lelystad, the Netherlands. Hararit () is a settlement in Galilee, Israel founded in 1980, as part of a &quot;government-sponsored project&quot; by a group of Jewish practitioners of the Transcendental Meditation program. It is the home for about 60 families. There are several residential facilities in India, including a compound in &quot;Maharishi Nagar&quot;, near Noida. There is a 70-unit development, Ideal Village Co-Op Inc, in Orleans, Ontario, a suburb of Ottawa, where 75 percent of the residents have been TM meditators.

====Monastic communities====
Purusha and Mother Divine are the names of gender specific communities who lead a lifestyle of celibacy and meditation. Some residents have been part of the community for 20 years or more.

In 1990 the Purusha community consisted of 200 men who conducted &quot;administrative and promotional details&quot; for the Maharishi&#x27;s worldwide organization. The Purusha group was originally located at the Spiritual Center of America in Boone, North Carolina, US. As of 2002 there were 300 male residents whose daily routine consisted of meditation from 7 am to 11:30 am and another group meditation in the evening. The rest of the day was taken up by lunch, educational presentations, fundraising and work for &quot;non-profit entities associated with the Spiritual Center&quot;. The residents also read Vedic literature, studied Sanskrit, received monthly instruction from the Maharishi via teleconference and engaged in discourse with faculty of Maharishi University of Management. As of 2007, there was also a Purusha community of 59 men in Uttarkashi, India. In 2012 the USA Purusha group moved to a newly constructed campus called the West Virginia Retreat Center, located in Three Churches, West Virginia, US. The campus consists of 10 buildings and 90 males residents plus staff.

As of 2002 the 100 resident Mother Divine community for women was also located at the Spiritual Center in Boone, North Carolina as part of an organization called Maharishi Global Administration Through Natural Law. Their daily routine was similar to the Purúsha community and in addition they operated The Heavenly Mountain Ideal Girls&#x27; School, a fully accredited North Carolina non-public school for grades 9 through 12.

===Publishing, TV and radio===

====MIU Press====
Maharishi International University (MIU) Press was founded in the 1970s and operated a full-scale printing operation to publish the organization&#x27;s brochures and literature for the United States. The Press employed four printing presses and 55 employees and was located at the Academy for the Science of Creative Intelligence in Livingston Manor, New York. MIU Press later became Maharishi University of Management (MUM) Press. MUM Press published books, academic papers, audio and video recordings and other educational materials. These materials include the &quot;Modern Science and Vedic Science&quot; journal and books by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, John Hagelin, Tony Nader, Robert Roth, Craig Pearson, Robert Oates, Ashley Deans, and Robert Keith Wallace as well as ancient Sanskrit works by Bādarāyaṇa, Kapila, and Jaimini. In addition their World Plan Television Productions contained a film library and audio and TV production studios, with $2 million worth of equipment, which distributed 1,000 videos each month to their TM teaching centers.

====KSCI TV station====
In 1975, the television station called channel 18 became KSCI and began production from a studio in West Los Angeles, while still licensed in San Bernardino. The station became a non-profit owned by the Transcendental Meditation movement and the call letters stood for Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&#x27;s theoretical &quot;Science of Creative Intelligence&quot;. The station broadcast began with 56 hours per week of &quot;uplifting&quot; news stories, prerecorded lectures by the Maharishi and variety shows featuring celebrities who practiced the Transcendental Meditation technique. KSCI&#x27;s goal was to report &quot;only good news&quot; and seven sister stations were planned including San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and Buffalo, New York. The station manager was Mark Fleischer, the son of Richard Fleischer, a Hollywood director. The Los Angeles location leased $95,000 worth of equipment and its highest paid staff member earned $6,000 according to tax documents.

In 1980 the station switched to for-profit status and earned $1 million on revenues of $8 million in 1985. In November, owners of the KSCI TV station loaned $350,000 to Maharishi International University in Iowa. As of June 1986 the station&#x27;s content consisted of &quot;a hodgepodge of programming in 14 languages&quot; that was broadcast on both cable and UHF in Southern California. In October, the station was purchased by its general manager and an investor for $40.5 million.

====KHOE radio station====

KHOE, is a low-power, non-profit radio station belonging to Maharishi University of Management (MUM), which began broadcasting in 1994. The station features music and educational entertainment from around the globe including American music and cultural and ethnic programming. MUM&#x27;s international students present music, poetry and literature from their native countries.
KHOE also broadcasts classical Indian (Maharishi Ghandarva Veda) music 24 hours per day on a special sideband.

====Satellite TV====
Maharishi Veda Vision is a satellite broadcast that began in 1998 with three hours of evening programming. Programing expanded to 24 hours a day by 1999. Maharishi Veda Vision was described as India&#x27;s first religious television channel. The Maharishi Channel Cable Network, owned by Maharishi Satellite Network, was reported to have moved to Ku band digital satellites in 2001. While providing Vedic wisdom in 19 languages, most of the channel&#x27;s programming was in Hindi and was intended for the worldwide non-resident Indian population. By 2002 the channel was carried on eight satellites serving 26 countries. The channel had no advertisements, depending on a &quot;huge network of organisations, products and services&quot; for support. In 2005, the channel was among several religious channels vying to get space on DD Direct+. Additional channels are broadcast over satellite as part of the Maharishi Open University&#x27;s distance learning program, which also has studio facilities at Maharishi Vedic City in Iowa. The Maharishi Channel, which originates in the Netherlands, had a pending request for a downlink to India as of July 2009. According to its website, Ramraj TV is being established in India to introduce Vedic principles and practical programmes to the &quot;World Family&quot;. As of August 2010, it is only available on the Internet. On a webpage last updated August 2009, the channel says it is in the process of obtaining a license from the Indian Government for a satellite uplink and downlink.

==Organizations==
The International Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence (IFSCI). American versions and additions to these organizations included the Spiritual Regeneration Movement Foundation (SRMF), the World Plan Executive Council which was established to serve as a guide for the movement there and the American Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence, for people in business and education. Active international organizations include the International Meditation Society, Maharishi Foundation, Global Country of World Peace and the David Lynch Foundation.

In 2007, the organization&#x27;s &quot;worldwide network&quot; was reported to be primarily financed through courses in the Transcendental Meditation technique with additional income from donations and real estate assets. Valuations for the organization are US$300 million in the United States and $3.5 billion worldwide.

===Historically listed===

====1958: Spiritual Regeneration Movement and Foundation====
The Spiritual Regeneration Movement was established in India in 1958 and the Spiritual Regeneration Movement Foundation (SRMF) was incorporated in California, US, in July 1959 as a non-profit organization, with its headquarters in Los Angeles. SRMF&#x27;s articles of incorporation describe the corporate purpose as educational and spiritual. Article 11 of the articles of incorporation read: &quot;this corporation is a religious one. The educational purpose shall be to give instruction in a simple system of meditation&quot;. The SRMF corporation was later dissolved. SRM offered TM courses to individuals &quot;specifically interested in personal development in the context of a spiritual, holistic approach to knowledge&quot;. SRM addressed a smaller and older segment of the population as compared with subsequent organizations such as the International Meditation Society and the Students International Meditation Society. According to British author Una Kroll, SRM was not a community and in the early 1970s the organization &quot;cast off its semi-religious clothing and pursued science in a big way&quot;.

In January 2012 the Pioneer News Service, New Delhi, reported that several trusts, including the SRM Foundation of India, had become &quot;non-functional&quot; after the death of the Maharishi in 2008 and were immersed in controversy after trust members alleged that parcels of land had been &quot;illegally sold off&quot; by other trust members without proper authorization. In June the dispute was reported to be specifically between members of the SRM Foundation India, board of directors, over control of the foundation&#x27;s assets, including 12,000 acres of land spread around India. The two factions had accused each other of forging documents and selling land for &quot;personal gains&quot; without the sanction of the entire 12-member board. The two parties petitioned the Indian courts for a stay of all land sales until the Department and the Ministry of Home Affairs could conduct an investigation of the alleged improprieties. The newspaper went on to report that only four years after the Maharishi&#x27;s death, his Indian legacy was &quot;in tatters&quot;.
====1959: International Meditation Society====
In 1959 the Maharishi went to England and established the British arm of the International Meditation Society with an additional office in San Francisco California, US. The International Meditation Society was founded in the U.S. in 1961 to offer both beginning and advanced courses in Transcendental Meditation to the general public. As of 2007 it was still an active organization in Israel.

====1965: Students International Meditation Society====
The Students International Meditation Society (SIMS) was first established in Germany in 1964. A United States chapter was created in 1965 and offered courses to students and the youth of society. The UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) chapter of SIMS, which had 1,000 members, was founded by Peter Wallace and his brother Robert Keith Wallace, the first president of Maharishi International University. In the 1970s, SIMS centers were established at &quot;over one thousand campuses&quot; in the United States, and similar growth occurred in Germany, Canada and Britain.

====1970: International Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence====
Transcendental Meditation has been utilized in corporations, both in the United States and in India, under the auspices of the International Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence and the Maharishi Development Corporation. In India a number of companies provide the TM technique to their managers. These companies include AirTel, Siemens, American Express, SRF Limited, Wipro, Hero Honda, Ranbaxy, Hewlett-Packard, BHEL, BPL Group, ESPN Star Sports, Tisco, Eveready, Maruti, Godrej Group and Marico. The employees at Marico practice Transcendental Meditation in groups as part of their standard workday. The US branch of the organization is called the American Foundation for the Science of Creative Intelligence (AFSCI) and as of 1975 it had conducted TM courses at General Foods, AT&amp;T Corporation Connecticut General Life Insurance Company and Blue Cross/Blue Shield. As of 2001, US companies such as General Motors and IBM were subsidizing the TM course fee for their employees. The organization has been described as one of several &quot;holistic health groups&quot; that attempted to incorporate elements of psychology and spirituality into healthcare.

The Maharishi Corporate Development Program is another international non-profit organization that offers the TM program to people in industry and business. According to religious scholar Christopher Partridge, &quot;hundreds&quot; of Japanese business&#x27; have incorporated the meditation programs offered by Maharishi Corporate Development International including Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. In 1995 the Fortune Motor Co. of Taiwan reportedly had a 100% increase in sales after participating in the program. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported in 2005, that US real estate developer, The Tower Companies, had added classes in Transcendental Meditation to their employee benefit program with 70% participation.

====1972: World Plan Executive Council====

The World Plan Executive Council&#x27;s (WPEC) international headquarters were located in Seelisberg, Switzerland and its American headquarters in Washington, D.C. The organization name was taken from the Maharishi&#x27;s &quot;world plan&quot;, which aimed to develop the full potential of the individual; improve governmental achievements; realize the highest ideal of education; eliminate the problems of crime and all behavior that brings unhappiness to the family of man; maximize the intelligent use of the environment; bring fulfillment to the economic aspirations of individuals and society; and achieve the spiritual goals of mankind in this generation. It provided courses in the Transcendental Meditation technique and other related programs.

It was founded in Italy in 1972 and by 1992 had organized twenty-five TM centers with thirty-five thousand participants in that country. In 1998 the World Plan Executive Council Australia (WPECA) sought the approval of the New South Wales Labor Council (NSWLC) to allow a resort on property owned by NSWLC.

The World Plan Executive Council (WPEC) was established in the U.S. as a non-profit educational corporation to guide its Transcendental Meditation movement. Its president was an American and former news reporter named Jerry Jarvis and the Maharishi is reported to have had &quot;no legal, official or paid relationship with WPEC&quot;. WPEC was an umbrella organization and operated almost exclusively on revenues generated from TM course fees. It featured corporate trappings such as &quot;computerized mailings, high-speed communications, links, even a well-turned medical and life insurance plan for its employees&quot;. WPEC supervised the 375 urban TM centers as well as several failed resorts that were purchased or leased as &quot;forest academies&quot; for in-residence meditation classes and courses. It had $40 million in tax exempt revenues from 1970 to 1974 and in 1975 it had $12 million in annual revenues but did not employ any outside public relations firm.
In 1985, a civil suit were filed against the World Plan Executive Council, in the United States by Robert Kropinski, Jane Greene, Patrick Ryan and Diane Hendel claiming fraud and psychological, physical, and emotional harm as a result of the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs. The district court dismissed Kropinski&#x27;s claims concerning intentional tort and negligent infliction of emotional distress, and referred the claims of fraud and negligent infliction of physical and psychological injuries to a jury trial. The jury awarded Kropinski $137,890 in the fraud and negligence claims. The appellate court overturned the award and dismissed Kropinski&#x27;s claim alleging psychological damage. The claim of fraud and the claim of a physical injury related to his practice of the TM-Sidhi program were remanded to the lower court for retrial. Kropinski, Green, Ryan and the defendants settled the remaining claims out of court on undisclosed terms. The remaining suit by Hendel, not included in the settlement, was later dismissed because the claims were barred by the statute of limitations. In affirming the dismissal, the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit held that Hendel&#x27;s claims were time-barred under the discovery rule because &quot;...the defendants made representations which any reasonable person would recognize as being contrary to common human experience and, indeed, to the laws of physics. If, as Ms. Hendel alleges, she was told that meditators would slowly rise in the air, and that some of them were &#x27;flying over Lake Lucern&#x27; or &#x27;walking through walls, hovering, and becoming invisible,&#x27; and that her failure to go to bed on time could bring about World War III, then a reasonable person would surely have noticed, at some time prior to September 1, 1986, that some of these representations might not be true.&quot;

In the 1990s WPEC in the United States became the parent company to an American, for-profit, hotel subsidiary called Heaven on Earth Inns Corp. with Thomas M. Headley as its president. The Heaven on Earth Inns Corp. was reported to have purchased nine US hotels at cut-rate prices that year, including two in Ohio, one in Oklahoma and one in Omaha, Nebraska. The hotels were bought as facilities for TM classes and as income-producing operations for health-conscious travelers who preferred vegetarian meals, alcohol free environments and non-smoking accommodations. The following year WPEC purchased a hotel in Asbury Park, New Jersey and a &quot;shuttered&quot; hotel in St. Louis, Missouri. WPEC also &quot;took over&quot; Chicago&#x27;s Blackstone Hotel via foreclosure in 1995.

The Maharishi Global Development Fund (MGDF) purchased the Clarion Hotel in Hartford, Connecticut, US, in 1995 for $1.5 million and sold it to Wonder Works Construction in 2011. In 2006 MGDF&#x27;s assets were listed as $192.3 million with $51.4 million in income.

====1975: Maharishi Foundation====
Maharishi Foundation is an educational and charitable organization active in at least four countries. The Maharishi Foundation&#x27;s headquarters resided at Mentmore Towers in Buckinghamshire beginning in 1978 and later moved to Skelmersdale, West Lancashire, England. According to its website, Maharishi Foundation is a &quot;registered, educational charity&quot; that was established in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom in 1975. Its purpose is to advance public education by offering courses and services for human development including Transcendental Meditation. The foundation is said to promote Consciousness-Based Education and research on Transcendental Meditation by &quot;independent academic institutions&quot; and reported $7 million in revenues in 2010. Similar corporations include the Maharishi Foundation Incorporated in New Zealand and Maharishi Foundation U.S.A. Maharishi Foundation purchased the Kolleg St. Ludwig campus in 1984 for USD 900,000 and it became the Maharishi European Research University (MERU) campus as well as the Maharishi&#x27;s movement headquarters and residence. The buildings were old, inefficient, in disrepair and did not meet the Maharishi Sthapatya Veda requirements of an east facing entrance. A 2006 report in the Los Angeles Times said the Maharishi&#x27;s organization has been involved in a two year &quot;courtroom battle&quot; with preservationist who wanted to block the demolition of the Kollege St. Ludwig building which &quot;was abandoned in 1978&quot; by its previous owners. A three-story, canvas illustration of the intended replacement building was put up on the front side of the building but local government ordered its removal. According to a 2008 report, the MERU Foundation indicated it would consider leaving the site if permission to demolish the old building was not granted. In 2015, the old buildings were removed completely.
By 1996, it was referred to as the &quot;Maharishi Continental Capital of the Age of Enlightenment for Europe&quot;. In 1998, the overall redevelopment plan for the location was budgeted at USD 50 million. Aerial photographs show the development of the site. Floodlights illuminated the new building constructed in 1997 and 164 flagpoles carried the flags of the world nations &quot;like a meditation-based United Nations.&quot; Local authorities later limited the use of floodlights and required removal of the flagpoles. Tony Nader was crowned Maharaja Raja Raam there in 2001, and it became a &quot;capital&quot; of the Global Country of World Peace. By 2006, the campus had 50 residents and had been visited by John Hagelin and Doug Henning in prior years.

In November 2011 Maharishi Foundation USA filed a lawsuit in Federal court against The Meditation House LLC for infringement of the foundation&#x27;s Transcendental Meditation trademark which are licensed to select organizations. The foundation alleges that its &quot;credibility and positive image&quot; are being used to &quot;mislead customers&quot; while the defendant asserts the foundation has an unfair monopoly on an ancient technique.

====1976: World Government of the Age of Enlightenment====
This self described non-political, non-religious, global organization was formed in 1976 by the Maharishi As of 1985 the World Government of the Age of Enlightenment was administrated by its president, Thomas A. Headly. Its purpose was to teach the Science of Creative Intelligence and the Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi programs and to accomplish the seven goals of the World Plan. In addition, the organization gave Maharishi Awards to several outstanding members of the community each year.

====1988: Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp.====

Maharishi Heaven on Earth Development Corp. (MHOED) is a for-profit real estate developer associated with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and his Transcendental Meditation movement. First founded in Malibu California in 1988, it has sought to build utopian projects in the U.S., Canada, and Africa with a long-term goal to &quot;reconstruct the entire world&quot;, at an estimated cost of $100 trillion. The US arm planned to work with developers to build 50 &quot;Maharishi Cities of Immortals&quot; in the US and Canada. The Canadian arm bought and renovated the Fleck/Paterson House in Ottawa in 2002, earning the &quot;adaptive use award of excellence&quot; from the City. A subsidiary purchased land to build Maharishi Veda Land theme parks in Orlando, Florida and Niagara Falls, New York. The Dutch arm negotiated with the presidents of Zambia and Mozambique to acquire a quarter of the land in those countries in exchange for solving their problems.

====1992: Natural Law Party====

Founded in 1992, the Natural Law Party (NLP) was a transnational party based on the teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The party was founded on the concept that Natural Law is the organizing principle that governs the universe and that the problems of humanity are caused by people violating Natural Law. The NLP supported using scientifically verifiable procedures such as the Transcendental Meditation technique and TM-Sidhi program to reduce or eliminate the problems in society. The party was active in up to 74 countries and ran candidates in many countries including the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Israel, and Taiwan.

Two of the most prominent candidates were John Hagelin, who campaigned for U.S. president in 1992, 1996 and 2004, and magician Doug Henning who ran for office in England. Electoral successes were achieved by the Ajeya Bharat Party in India, which elected a legislator to a state assembly, and by the Croatian NLP, which elected a member of a regional assembly in 1993. The party was disbanded in some countries beginning in 2004 but continues in India and in a few U.S. states.

====1993: Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation====
Maharishi Vedic Education Development Corporation (MVEDC) is a non-profit, American organization, incorporated in 1993 and headquartered in Fairfield, Iowa. Bevan G. Morris is the acting and founding president of the corporation and Richard Quinn is the director of project finance. MVED&#x27;s primary purpose is the administration of Transcendental Meditation courses and training TM instructors in the United States. Courses in Transcendental Meditation are led by TM teachers trained by MVED. MVED also provides promotional literature to its teachers and TM centers

In 1975 the US non-profit oversaw five owned properties and hundreds of rented facilities that offered meditation lectures and seminars. One facility located in Livingston Manor, New York housed a 350-room hotel, a printing press and a professional quality video and sound-recording studio. MVED is the sublicensee for many trademarks owned by the U.K. non-profit Maharishi Foundation Ltd. These trademarks include: Transcendental Meditation, TM-Sidhi, Yogic Flying and Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health.

In 2004, the lawsuit &quot;Butler vs. MUM&quot; alleged that MVED was guilty of negligent representation and had direct liability for the death of a Maharishi University of Management student. In 2008, all charges against MVED were dismissed and the lawsuit was dropped. According to journalist Antony Barnett, the attacks led critics to question the movement&#x27;s claims that group practice of advanced meditation techniques could end violence. Maharishi said of the incident that &quot;this is an aspect of the violence we see throughout society&quot;, including the violence that the U.S. perpetrates in other countries.

MVED has created educational enterprises, such as Maharishi Vedic University and Maharishi Medical Center, and has overseen the construction and development of Maharishi Peace Palaces owned by the Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) in 30 locations in the United States.
Maharishi Peace Palaces, Transcendental Meditation Centers, Maharishi Enlightenment Centers, and Maharishi Invincibility Centers provide training and Maharishi Ayurveda treatments as well as serving as local centers for TM and TM-Sidhi practitioners

====2001: Global Country of World Peace====
The Global Country of World Peace (GCWP) was declared by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, the founder of Transcendental Meditation, on Vijayadashami (Victory Day), 7 October 2000. He described it as &quot;a country without borders for peace loving people everywhere&quot;. GCWP is structured as a kingdom, with Tony Nader as its current Maharaja or Sovereign Ruler. It became incorporated in the state of Iowa, US, on 15 October 2002 as a non-profit organization with Bevan Morris as its president. The corporation has its headquarters in Maharishi Vedic City, Iowa. It has, or is building, capitals in the Netherlands, Iowa, Kansas, West Virginia, Manhattan, and India.

==Marketing==
The public presentation of the TM technique has varied over its 50 year history. Some authors have praised its methods and success while others have criticized its marketing techniques. For example author G. Francis Xavier writes, the Maharishi is &quot;one of the best salesman&quot; and has made full use of the mass media to propagate TM around the world while authors Bainbridge and Stark criticize the TM movement for using endorsements from the scientific establishment as &quot;propaganda&quot;, reprinting favorable articles and using positive statements by government officials in conjunction with their publicity efforts. On the other hand, cardiologist Stephen Sinatra and professor of medicine Marc Houston have said of the Maharishi: &quot;His emphasis on scientific research proved that the timeless practice of meditation was not just an arcane mystical activity for Himalayan recluses, but rather a mind-body method hugely relevant to and beneficial for modern society&quot;.

===History===
According to one account, the Maharishi in 1959 began &quot;building an infrastructure&quot; using a &quot;mass marketing model&quot; for teaching the TM technique to Westerners. First, the Maharishi visited the U.S. because he felt that its people were ready to try something new, and the rest of the world would then &quot;take notice&quot;. By the same token, author Philip Goldberg says the Maharishi&#x27;s insistence that TM was easy to do was not a &quot;marketing ploy&quot;, but rather &quot;a statement about the nature of the mind.&quot; In 1963 the Maharishi published his first book on Transcendental Meditation called &quot;The Science of Being and Art of Living&quot;. In the mid-1960s, the TM organization began presenting its meditation to students via a campaign led by a man named Jerry Jarvis who had taken the TM course in 1961. By 1966, the Students Meditation Society (SIMS) had begun programs in U.S. colleges such as University of California, Berkeley, Harvard, Yale and others, and was a &quot;phenomenal success&quot;.

In the late 1960s, the TM technique received &quot;major publicity&quot; through its associations with The Beatles, and by identifying itself with various aspects of modern day counterculture. However, Goldberg and others say that during the first decade of the TM organization, the Maharishi&#x27;s main students in the West were not rock stars and their fans, but ordinary, middle-aged citizens. In the late 60&#x27;s, young people coming to learn TM at the center in London, England, were surprised &quot;to be greeted not by fellow hippies but by the proper, middle-aged men and women who were Maharishi&#x27;s earliest followers.&quot; Another author notes that, &quot;By the time the Beatles first met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in London in 1966, Mahesh had already made seven trips around the globe, established 38 centres, and amassed more than 100,000 followers.&quot;

While Lennon and Harrison were in India in 1968 there were tensions with the Maharishi over business negotiations for a proposed documentary film and television show. The Beatles were surprised to find the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator with an interest in publicity, business and finances.

TM is said to have taken full advantage of all available publicity, and began to market to specific populations, such as spiritual people, political people and &quot;pragmatic&quot; self-help people. The latter approach is said to have been &quot;given impetus&quot; by the scientific research on the technique. In &quot;The Future of Religion&quot;, sociologists Bainbridge and Stark write that, while the movement attracted many people through endorsements from celebrities such as The Beatles, another marketing approach was &quot;getting articles published in scientific journals, apparently proving TM&#x27;s claims or at least giving them scientific status&quot;. In the 1970s, according to Philip Goldberg, the Maharishi began encouraging research on the TM technique because he felt that hard scientific data would be a useful marketing tool and a way to re-brand meditation as a scientific form of deep rest, rather than a mystical &quot;samadhi&quot;; one of his first steps in secularizing the technique. The Maharishi&#x27;s &quot;appropriation of science was clearly part of his agenda from the beginning&quot; says Goldberg, and so his &quot;organization was incorporated as an educational non-profit, not a religious one&quot;. The Maharishi asked people with marketing expertise, like SIMS president, Jarvis, to present TM as a method for inner peace and relaxation based on scientific proof and, because the TM technique was the first type of meditation to undergo scientific testing, it &quot;has always received the most publicity&quot;.

The first peer-reviewed research on TM, conducted by physiologist Robert K. Wallace at UCLA, appeared in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in 1970. It attracted significant public and scientific attention. The study&#x27;s findings were also published in the &quot;American Journal of Physiology&quot; in 1971, in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1972, and reported in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1971. Between mid-1970 and 1974, the number of research institutions conducting research on TM grew from four to over 100.

Several researchers have said that Maharishi&#x27;s encouragement of research on TM resulted in a beneficial increase in the scientific understanding of not only TM but of meditation in general, resulting in the increased use of meditation to alleviate health problems and to improve mind and body. Neuroscientists Ronald Jevning and James O’Halloran wrote in 1984 that &quot;The proposal of the existence of a unique or fourth state of consciousness with a basis in physiology&quot; by the Maharishi in 1968 was &quot;a major contribution to the study of human behavior&quot; resulting in &quot;a myriad of scientific studies both basic and applied in an area heretofore reserved for ‘mysticism&#x27;.&quot; Research reviews of the effects of the Transcendental Meditation technique have yielded results ranging from inconclusive to clinically significant. &quot;Newsweek&quot; science writer Sharon Begley said that &quot;the Maharishi deserves credit for introducing the study of meditation to biology. Hospitals from Stanford to Duke have instituted meditation programs to help patients cope with chronic pain and other ailments.&quot;

According to Bainbridge and Stark, TM had engaged in several mass media campaigns prior to 1973, and had received a great amount of publicity, but the main source of new TM students was word of mouth, or the &quot;advice of friends&quot;, because &quot;TM was a relatively cheap, short-term service, requiring no deep commitment&quot;. Author Jack Forem agrees, and writes: &quot;the main source of publicity for the movement has been satisfied practitioners spreading the news by word of mouth&quot;.

In 1973, Maharishi International University (MIU) faculty member, Michael Peter Cain co-wrote a book with Harold Bloomfield and Dennis T. Jaffe called &quot;TM: Discovering Inner Energy and Overcoming Stress&quot;. The TM movement&#x27;s area coordinator, Jack Forem, published his book &quot;Transcendental Meditation, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and the Science of Creative Intelligence&quot; in 1976. That year, TM teacher, Peter Russell, released his book &quot;An Introduction to Transcendental Meditation and the Teachings of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi&quot; as did MIU board of trustees member, Nat Goldhaber who wrote &quot;TM: An alphabetical guide to the transcendental meditation program&quot;. The Maharishi made appearances on the &quot;Merv Griffin Show&quot; in 1975 and again in 1977. TM teacher, George Ellis published a book called &quot;Inside Folsom Prison: Transcendental Meditation and TM-Sidhi Program&quot; in 1983. Movement spokesman, Robert Roth, published his book, &quot;TM: Transcendental Meditation: A New Introduction to Maharishi&#x27;s Easy, Effective and Scientifically Proven Technique&quot; in 1988. As of 1993 the organization was utilizing its own public relations office called the Age of Enlightenment News Service. In a scene in the 1999 film, &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, TM meditator Andy Kaufman was asked to leave a TM teacher training course because his performances were incompatible with the behavior expected of a TM teacher. The Maharishi gave his first interview in 25 years on the &quot;Larry King Show&quot; in May 2002. Additional books were published by Maharishi University of Management (MUM) faculty and researchers such as David Orme-Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Transcendental Meditation in Criminal Rehabilitation and Crime Prevention&quot; in 2003 and Robert Scheider&#x27;s &quot;Total Heart Health: How to Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease with the Maharishi Vedic Approach to Health&quot; in 2006.

According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, since 2008 there has been an increased number of celebrity endorsements for Transcendental Meditation. Those who have appeared at promotional events to raise funds to teach TM to students, veterans, prisoners and others include comedian/actor Russell Brand, TV host/physician Mehmet Oz, and singer Moby. A benefit performance in New York City in 2009 included a reunion performance by musicians Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, Donovan, Sheryl Crow, Eddie Vedder, Bettye LaVette, Ben Harper, Paul Horn, and Mike Love. Others appearances included comedian Jerry Seinfeld, actress Laura Dern, and radio talk show host Howard Stern. The book was published by psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal in 2011 and MUM faculty member Fred Travis published &quot;Your Brain is a River, Not a Rock&quot; in 2012. A jazz concert to benefit the David Lynch Foundation was held in New York City in 2013. The events included remarks by TV hosts Mehmet Oz, George Stephanopoulos and actress Liv Tyler with musical performances by Herbie Hancock, Corrine Bailey Rae and Wynton Marsalis.

===Reception to Marketing===
In 1988, author J. Isamu Yamamoto wrote that &quot;TM was called the McDonald&#x27;s of meditation because of its extravagantly successful packaging of Eastern Meditation for the American mass market&quot;. According to the 1980 book, &quot;TM and Cult Mania&quot;, scientists associated with TM have attempted to prove the Maharishi&#x27;s concepts by uniting scientific data and mystical philosophy. The 2010 book, &quot;Teaching Mindfulness&quot;, says that TM&#x27;s eventual success as a new social movement was based on the &quot;translation in Western language and settings, popular recognition, adoption within scientific research in powerful institutions.&quot; The book goes on to say that TM&#x27;s &quot;use of sophisticated marketing and public relations techniques, represents a model for success in the building of new social movements&quot;. Sociologist Hank Johnston, who analyzed TM as a &quot;marketed social movement&quot; in a 1980 paper, says that TM has used sophisticated techniques, such as tailored promotional messages for different audiences, and pragmatically adapted them to different cultures and changing times. Johnston says that TM&#x27;s &quot;calculated strategies&quot; have led to its &quot;rapid growth&quot;. In particular, it has objectified the rank-and-file membership, marketed the movement as a product, and created a perception of grievances for which it offers a panacea. In her book, &quot;The Field&quot;, author Lynne McTaggart notes that the &quot;organization has been ridiculed, largely because of the promotion of the Maharishi&#x27;s own personal interests&quot;, but suggests that &quot;the sheer weight of data...[on the Maharishi Effect]...is compelling&quot;. According to an article in &quot;The Independent&quot;, despite early criticism, the TM technique has moved from margin to mainstream, due mostly to its &quot;burgeoning body of scientific research&quot;. Its recent appeal seems due to the possibility of relaxation with no chemical assistance. Jerrold Greenberg in his book &quot;Comprehensive Stress Management&quot; writes that the Maharishi was a &quot;major exporter of meditation to the Western world&quot; who &quot;developed a large, worldwide, and highly effective organization to teach Transcendental Meditation&quot;. Greenberg goes on to say that &quot;the simplicity of this technique, coupled with the effectiveness of its marketing by TM organizations quickly led to its popularity.&quot; According to Goldberg, research and meditation in general are likely to be the Maharishi&#x27;s &quot;lasting legacy&quot;.

==Criticism and evaluation==

===Purity of the Maharishi&#x27;s teaching===
The Maharishi believed that in order to maintain the continuity of Transcendental Meditation it had to be taught by trained teachers in dedicated centers. Maharishi recorded his lectures; systematized the teaching of the technique, insisted the technique not be mixed with other techniques and separated the technique from other points of view and practices that might confuse its understanding. He said that the &quot;purity of the system of meditation&quot; must be maintained &quot;at any cost because the effect lies in the purity of the teaching&quot;. TM practitioners that are suspected of interacting with other gurus can be banned from meditations and lose other privileges. In the 1990s, Maharishi prohibited his students from interacting with Deepak Chopra. As a result, Lowe writes, the number of sufficiently orthodox practitioners was significantly reduced by 2007. In 1983, Robin Wadsworth Carlson began teaching his meditation program via a &quot;World Teacher Seminar.&quot; Many students at Maharishi International University (MIU) were suspended after describing the literature promoting the seminar. In response Carlson filed a lawsuit against MIU alleging interference in conducting his seminars.

===New religious movement===
George Chryssides identifies the TM movement as one of the new religious movements &quot;which lacks overtly religious features as traditionally understood&quot; and whose focus is on human potential. He also describes the TM movement in terms of Roy Wallis&#x27;s typological terms as a world affirming rather than world renouncing or world accommodating new religious movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chryssides/Exploring&quot;&gt;(Roy Wallis, 1985, page 5)&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious studies scholar, Tamar Gablinger, the &quot;complex structure&quot; of the TM organization falls somewhere between being a commercial entity and a religious and social movement. Gablinger says this allows sociologists to categorize it in a variety of ways. Both Gablinger and sociologist Hank Johnston describe the TM organization as a &quot;marketed social movement.&quot;

===Connections to Hinduism===
Author Noretta Koertge asserts that the TM movement introduced to the West the &quot;scientistic version of Hinduism&quot;; the idea that &quot;the Vedas are simply another name for science&quot;. The TM movement has been described by Neusner as being a neo-Hindu adaptation of classical Vedantic Hinduism, while author Gerald James Larson says it retains &quot;only shallow connections&quot; to Hinduism.

Critics charge that the TM movement is a bastardized form of Hinduism which denies its religious roots and claims a scientific basis for the purpose of securing government funding for its programs. In their book, &quot;Millennium, Messiahs, and Mayhem: Contemporary Apocalyptic Movements&quot;, Robbins and Palmer refer to the Maharishi&#x27;s teaching that the practice of Transcendental Meditation will bring Ram Rajya (the rule of God) on earth as a form of progressive millennialism from the Hindu tradition.

=== Cult, sect, religion ===
Along with other movements that developed as part of the hippie subculture in the 1960s, there has been debate on &quot;cult&quot;-like aspects of the Transcendental Meditation movement. Camille Paglia wrote that TM was the &quot;major Asian cult&quot; of the 1960s. The Israeli Center for Cult Victims also considers the movement to be a cult. Maharishi University says that it is not a religious institution but people who have left the movement refer to it as a cult which requires &quot;deprogramming&quot; for former members.

In 1987, the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) held a press conference and demonstration in Washington, D.C., saying that the organization that teaches the Transcendental Meditation technique &quot;seeks to strip individuals of their ability to think and choose freely.&quot; Steven Hassan, an author on the topic of cults, and at one time a CAN deprogrammer, said at the press conference that members display cult-like behaviors, such as the use of certain language and particular ways of dressing. TM teacher and spokesperson, Dean Draznin, &quot;discounted CAN&#x27;s claims&quot; saying that Transcendental Meditation &quot;doesn&#x27;t involve beliefs or lifestyle&quot; or &quot;mind control&quot; and &quot;We don&#x27;t force people to take courses&quot;. Another spokesperson, Mark Haviland of the related College of Natural Law said that TM is &quot;not a philosophy, a life style or a religion.&quot;

Author Shirley Harrison says that the method of recruitment is one sign that helps to identify cult, and that TM&#x27;s only method is advertising. She also says that &quot;none of the other &#x27;cultic qualities&#x27; defined by cultwatchers can be fairly attributed to TM.&quot; Harrison writes that the Maharishi&#x27;s teaching does not require conversion and that Transcendental Meditation does not have a religious creed.

In the book &quot;Cults and New Religions&quot;, Cowan and Bromley write that TM is presented to the public as a meditation practice that has been validated by science but is not a religious practice nor is it affiliated with any religious tradition. They say that &quot;although there are some dedicated followers of TM who devote most or all of their time to furthering the practice of Transcendental Meditation in late modern society, the vast majority of those who practice do so on their own, often as part of what has been loosely described as the New Age Movement. &quot; They say that most scholars view Transcendental Meditation as having elements of both therapy and religion, but that on the other hand, &quot;Transcendental Meditation has no designated scripture, no set of doctrinal requirements, no ongoing worship activity, and no discernible community of believers.&quot; They also say that Maharishi didn&#x27;t claim to have special divine revelation or supernatural personal qualities.

Marc Galanter, writes in his book &quot;&quot; that TM &quot;evolved into something of a charismatic movement, with a belief system that transcended the domain of its practice&quot;. He notes how a variety of unreasonable beliefs came to be seen as literally true by its &quot;more committed members&quot;. He cites an &quot;unlikely set of beliefs&quot; that includes the ability to levitate and reduce traffic accidents and conflicts in the Middle East through the practice of meditation.

In his book &quot;Soul snatchers: the mechanics of cults&quot;, Jean-Marie Abgrall describes how Altered States Of Consciousness (ASCs) are used in many cults to make the initiate more susceptible to the group will and world view. He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed the similarities between the states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs. In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras is one of the most widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally. He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its success will rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a guru he notes paraphrenia, a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In regard to this he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including &#x27;yogic flying&#x27; as a way to reduce crime.

In his book &quot;The Elementary Forms of The New Religious Life&quot;, Roy Wallis writes in the chapter called &quot;Three Types of New Religious Movements&quot; that TM is a &quot;world affirming new religion which does not reject the world and its organisation&quot; [sic]. Wallis goes on to say that &quot;no rigorous discipline is normally involved&quot; and &quot;no extensive doctrinal commitment is entailed, at least not at the outset&quot;. Likewise, he writes, &quot;No one is required to declare a belief in TM, in the Maharishi or even in the possible effects of the technique&quot;. In a later chapter called &quot;The Precariousness of the Market&quot;, he writes that TM meditators are &quot;expected to employ the movement&#x27;s rhetoric and conceptual vocabulary&quot; and shift from an empirical product [the Transcendental Meditation technique] to a &quot;system of belief and practice&quot; [such as the TM Sidhi program] and in this way &quot;the movement shifts from cult towards sect&quot;. Sociologist Alan E. Aldridge writes that Transcendental Meditation fits Roy Wallis&#x27; definition of a &quot;world-affirming religion&quot;. According to Aldridge, TM has an ethos of &quot;individual self-realization&quot; and &quot;an inner core of committed members&quot; who practice more advanced techniques (the TM-Sidhi program) that may not even be known to the &quot;ordinary consumer of TM&quot;.

Reporter Michael D&#x27;Antonio wrote in his book, &quot;Heaven on Earth – Dispatches from America&#x27;s Spiritual Frontier&quot; that, as practiced at Maharishi International University, Transcendental Meditation is &quot;a cult rather than a culture&quot;. D&#x27;Antonio wrote that Transcendental Meditation was like the worst of religion: rigid, unreasonable, repressive, and authoritarian, characterized by overt manipulation, a disregard for serious scholarship, and an unwillingness to question authority. For the first time in his travels he found people he believed to be truly deluded, and a physics department teaching theories that were dead wrong. D&#x27;Antonio charges that they have taken Transcendental Meditiation and transformed it &quot;into a grandiose narcissistic dream, a form of intellectual bondage, that they call enlightenment&quot;.

Clarke and Linzey argue that for the ordinary membership of TM their lives and daily concerns are little — if at all — affected by its cult nature. Instead, it is only the core membership who must give total dedication to the movement. A former TM teacher, who operates an online site critical of TM, says that 90 percent of participants take an introductory course and &quot;leave with only a nice memory of incense, flowers, and smiling gurus&quot; while &quot;the 10 percent who become more involved&quot;. He says those participants encounter &quot;environments where adherents often weren&#x27;t allowed to read the news or talk to family members&quot;. Another former TM Movement member, says there were &quot;times when devotees had their mail screened and were monitored by a Vigilance Committee&quot;.

Religious scholar Tamar Gablinger notes that some of the reports from &quot;apostates and adversaries&quot; who have written about their involvement with the TM movement are &quot;rather biased.&quot;

<doc id="632096" wikidata="Q1517903" url="?curid=632096" title="Seventeenth of Tammuz">
<text>The Seventeenth of Tammuz (, Modern: &quot;Shiv&#x27;á Asár beTammúz&quot;, Tiberian (SBL): &quot;Šib̲ʿāʿāśār bəṯammuz&quot;)) is a Jewish fast day commemorating the breach of the walls of Jerusalem before the destruction of the Second Temple. It falls on the 17th day of the fourth Hebrew month of Tammuz and marks the beginning of The Three Weeks, a mourning period leading up to Tisha B&#x27;Av.

The day also traditionally commemorates the destruction of the two tablets of the Ten Commandments and other historical calamities that befell the Jewish people on the same date.

==History==

The fast of Tammuz, according to Rabbi Akiva&#x27;s interpretation, is the fast mentioned in the Book of Zechariah as &quot;the fast of the fourth [month]&quot; (Zechariah 8:19). This refers to Tammuz, which is the fourth month of the Hebrew calendar.

According to the Mishnah, five calamities befell the Jewish people on this day: 
#Moses broke the two tablets of stone on Mount Sinai, when he saw the Golden calf;
#During the Babylonian siege of Jerusalem the daily &quot;tamid&quot; offering ceased to be brought because no sheep were available;
#During the Roman siege of Jerusalem, the city walls were breached, leading to the destruction of the Second Temple on Tisha B&#x27;Av;
#Prior to Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt, Roman military leader Apostomus burned a Torah scroll;
#An idol was erected in the Temple.

The Babylonian Talmud places the second and fifth tragedies in the First Temple period.

The Book of Jeremiah (39.2, 52.6–7) states that the walls of Jerusalem during the First Temple were breached on the 9th of Tammuz.
Accordingly, the Babylonian Talmud dates the third tragedy (breach of Jerusalem&#x27;s walls) to the Second Temple period. However, the Jerusalem Talmud (&quot;Taanit&quot; IV, 5) states that in both eras the walls were breached on 17th Tammuz, and that the text in Jeremiah 39 is explained by stating that the Biblical record was &quot;distorted&quot;, apparently due to the troubled times.

The Seventeenth of Tammuz occurs forty days after the Jewish holiday of Shavuot. Moses ascended Mount Sinai on Shavuot and remained there for forty days. The Children of Israel made the Golden Calf on the afternoon of the sixteenth of Tammuz when it seemed that Moses was not coming down when promised. Moses descended the next day (forty days by his count), saw that the Israelites were violating many of the laws he had received from God, and smashed the tablets.

==Customs==
As a minor fast day, fasting lasts from dawn to shortly after dusk. It is customary among Ashkenazi Jews to refrain from listening to music, public entertainment, and haircuts on fast days, and on this occasion because it is also part of The Three Weeks (see below, &quot;Bein haMetzarim&quot;). Other deprivations applicable to the major fasts (i.e. Yom Kippur and Tisha B&#x27;Av) do not apply.

If the 17th of Tammuz falls on a Shabbat, the fast is instead observed the next day, the 18th of Tammuz (on Sunday). This last occurred in 2022, and will occur again in 2029.

A Torah reading, a special prayer in the Amidah (Aneinu), and in many, but not all, Ashkenazic communities Avinu Malkenu are added at the morning Shacharit and afternoon Mincha services. Ashkenazi congregations also read a haftarah (from the Book of Isaiah) at Mincha. Congregations also recite during Shacharit a series of Selichot (special penitential prayers) reflecting the themes of the day.

==Cycle of fasts==
The 17th of Tammuz is the second of the four fasts commemorating the destruction of the Temple and the Jewish exile in Babylon. It is preceded by the fast of the Tenth of Tevet and arrives three weeks prior to the full-day fast of the Ninth of Av. The cycle is also associated historically with the Fast of Gedalia, which is observed on the third day of Tishrei.

==&quot;Bein haMetzarim&quot;==

The three weeks beginning with the 17th of Tammuz and ending with the Ninth of Av are known as &quot;Bein haMetzarim&quot; (&quot;between the straits&quot;, i.e. between the days of distress), or The Three Weeks. Some customs of mourning, which commemorate the destruction of Jerusalem, are observed from the start of the Three Weeks. 

The oldest extant reference to these days as &quot;Bein haMetzarim&quot; – which is also the first source for a special status of The Three Weeks – is found in Eikhah Rabbati 1.29 (Lamentations Rabbah, fourth century CE?). This midrash glosses Lamentations 1:3, &quot;All [Zion&#x27;s] pursuers overtook her between the straits.&quot;

The three weeks of mourning between the 17th of Tammuz and 9th of Av is cited as a rabbinically instituted period of fasting for the &quot;especially pious&quot;. Such fasting is observed from morning to evening, common with other rabbi-decreed fasts.

<text>This is a list of notable [[Western film]]s and [[Westerns on television|TV series]], ordered by year and decade of release. For a long-running TV series, the year is its first in production.

The movie industry began with the work of Louis Le Prince in 1888. Until 1903, films had been one-reelers, usually lasting 10 to 12 minutes, reflecting the amount of film that could be wound onto a standard reel for projection, hence the term. Edwin S. Porter was a former projectionist and exhibitor who had taken charge of motion-picture production at Thomas Edison&#x27;s company in 1901. He fully realised the potential of motion pictures as an entertainment medium and began making longer films that told a story. As with the films of Georges Méliès, these required multiple shots that could be edited into a narrative sequence.

The most famous work of early movies, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; is credited with establishing the movies as a commercial entertainment medium. It was notable for rapid shifts of location, including action on a moving train. Although there had previously been short films that referenced the Wild West or paid homage to it, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot; marked the birth of the genre.

Many movies and television programs and series were filmed at movie ranches, primarily in Southern California, often within the 35-mile limit to avoid union travel stipends. Some were owned by the studios, but others were independent.
In the 1960s, Spaghetti Westerns grew in popularity. These films were produced by Italians and Spaniards and shot in their countries with big American stars like Clint Eastwood or Henry Fonda. Films such as those of Sergio Leone&#x27;s &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; spawned numerous films of the same ilk and often similar titles, particularly from the mid- to late-1960s and early 1970s.

<doc id="632101" wikidata="Q1735004" url="?curid=632101" title="1700 Cascadia earthquake">
<text>The 1700 Cascadia earthquake occurred along the Cascadia subduction zone on January 26, 1700, with an estimated moment magnitude of 8.7–9.2. The megathrust earthquake involved the Juan de Fuca plate from mid-Vancouver Island, south along the Pacific Northwest coast as far as northern California. The plate slipped an average of along a fault rupture about long.

The earthquake caused a tsunami which struck the west coast of North America and the coast of Japan. Japanese tsunami records, along with reconstructions of the wave moving across the ocean, put the earthquake at about 9:00 PM Pacific Time on the evening of 26 January 1700.


== Evidence ==
The earthquake took place at about 21:00 PT on January 26, 1700 (NS). Although there are no written records for the region from the time, the timing of the earthquake has been inferred from Japanese records of a tsunami that does not correlate with any other Pacific Rim quake. The Japanese records exist primarily in the modern-day Iwate Prefecture, in communities such as Tsugaruishi, Miyako (Kuwagasaki) and Ōtsuchi.

==Scientific research==
The most important clue linking the tsunami in Japan and the earthquake in the Pacific Northwest comes from studies of tree rings (dendrochronology), which show that several &quot;ghost forests&quot; of red cedar trees in Oregon and Washington, killed by lowering of coastal forests into the tidal zone by the earthquake, have outermost growth rings that formed in 1699, the last growing season before the tsunami. This includes both inland stands of trees, such as one on the Copalis River in Washington, and pockets of tree stumps that are now under the ocean surface and become exposed only at low tide.

Sediment layers in these locations demonstrate a pattern consistent with seismic and tsunami events around this time. Core samples from the ocean floor, as well as debris samples from some earthquake-induced landslides in the Pacific Northwest, also support this timing of the event. Archaeological research in the region has uncovered evidence of several coastal villages having been flooded and abandoned around 1700.

== Cultural research ==
The contemporary indigenous groups of Cascadia had no known written documentation like that of the Japanese tsunami, but numerous oral traditions describing a great earthquake and inundation exist among indigenous coastal peoples from British Columbia to Northern California. These do not specify a date, and not all earthquake stories in the region can be ascribed to the 1700 quake; however, virtually all of the native peoples in the region have at least one traditional story of an event of unmatched destructive power.

Some of the stories contain temporal clues—such as a time estimate in generations since the event—which suggest a date range in the late 1600s or early 1700s, or which concur with the event&#x27;s timing in other ways. For instance, the Huu-ay-aht legend of a large earthquake and ocean wave devastating their settlements at Pachena Bay places the event on a winter evening shortly after the village&#x27;s residents had gone to sleep (consistent with the 9pm reconstructed time). Every community on Pachena Bay was wiped out except for Masit on a mountainside above sea level. The only other Panchena Bay survivor was a young woman named Anacla aq sop, who happened to be staying that day at Kiix-in, located on the less-tsunami-impacted Barkley Sound.

Kwakwaka&#x27;wakw (Kwakiutl) stories from the north end of Vancouver Island report a night-time earthquake that caused virtually all houses in their community to collapse; Cowichan stories from Vancouver Island&#x27;s inner coast speak of a nighttime earthquake, causing a landslide that buried an entire village. Makah stories from Washington speak of a great night-time earthquake, of which the only survivors were those who immediately fled inland before the tsunami hit. The Quileute people in Washington have a story about a flood so powerful that villagers in their canoes were swept inland all the way to Hood Canal.

Ethnographic research has focused on a common regional pattern of art and mythology depicting a great battle between a thunderbird and a whale, as well as cultural signifiers such as earthquake-inspired ritual masks and dances.

== Future threats ==

The geological record reveals that great earthquakes with moment magnitude 8 or higher occur in the Cascadia subduction zone about every 500 years on average, often accompanied by tsunamis. There is evidence of at least 13 events at intervals from about 300 to 900 years with an average of 570–590 years.

As seen in the 1700 quake, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, subduction zone earthquakes can cause large tsunamis, and many coastal areas in the region have prepared tsunami evacuation plans in anticipation of a possible future Cascadia earthquake. However, the major nearby cities, notably Seattle, Portland, Vancouver, Victoria, and Tacoma might be sheltered from the full brunt of a tsunami. These cities do have many vulnerable structures, especially bridges and unreinforced brick buildings; consequently, most of the damage to the cities would probably be from the earthquake itself. One expert asserts that buildings in Seattle are inadequate even to withstand an event of the size of the magnitude 7.9 1906 San Francisco earthquake, let alone a more powerful one.

Kenneth Murphy, who directs FEMA&#x27;s Region X, the division responsible for Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Alaska, stated, &quot;Our operating assumption is that everything west of Interstate 5 will be toast.&quot;

Recent findings conclude that the Cascadia subduction zone is more complex and volatile than previously believed. In 2010, geologists predicted a 37% chance of a magnitude 8.2+ event within 50 years, and a 10% to 15% chance that the entire Cascadia subduction zone will rupture with a magnitude 9+ event within the same time frame. Geologists have also determined the Pacific Northwest is not prepared for such an earthquake. The tsunami produced could reach heights of .

A 2004 study revealed the potential for relative mean sea level rise (caused by subsidence of coastal land) along the Cascadia subduction zone. It postulated that cities on the west coast of Vancouver Island, such as Tofino and Ucluelet, are at risk for a subsidence, relative to mean sea level.

The confirmation of their oral traditions about a great earthquake has led many aboriginal groups in the area to initiate projects to relocate their coastal communities to higher and safer ground in preparation for the predicted next earthquake. The Huu-ay-aht People have rebuilt their administration building on a high point in their territory; coastal residents are immediately evacuated to this building whenever a tsunami warning is issued, as an interim measure toward eventually relocating all residents to higher ground. The Quileute people secured a land grant from the US government in 2012 to move their settlement inland, both as protection from a future tsunami threat and because of more frequent flooding on the Quillayute River. The Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe also sought federal funding to move their community uphill receiving a FEMA PDM grant to build the first vertical evacuation tower on their coast, completed near the Tokeland Marina in 2022.

In 2023, Washington scientists reported on a detailed study of a high-pressure and high-temperature seafloor seep, likely on the plate boundary, offshore of Oregon. The first seep found on the CSZ, it has been named &#x27;Pythia&#x27;s Oasis&#x27;, and may play a role in the regulation of overpressures.

Some other subduction zones have major earthquakes every 100 to 200 years; the longer interval here may indicate unusually large stress buildup and subsequent unusually large earthquake slip.

== Bridge of the Gods – Bonneville Slide ==
It was once conjectured that the Cascadia earthquake may also have been linked to the Bridge of the Gods – Bonneville Slide and the Tseax Cone eruption in British Columbia, Canada. However, recent investigations using radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology date the Bonneville landslide around 1450.

<doc id="632103" wikidata="Q857320" url="?curid=632103" title="Biela's Comet">
<text>Biela&#x27;s Comet or Comet Biela (official designation: 3D/Biela) was a periodic Jupiter-family comet first recorded in 1772 by Montaigne and Messier and finally identified as periodic in 1826 by Wilhelm von Biela. It was subsequently observed to split in two and has not been seen since 1852. As a result, it is currently considered to have been destroyed, although remnants have survived for some time as a meteor shower, the Andromedids which may show increased activity in 2023.

== Discovery ==
The comet was first recorded on 8 March 1772 by Jacques Leibax Montaigne; during the same apparition it was independently discovered by Charles Messier. It was also recorded in 1805 by Jean-Louis Pons, but was not recognized as the same object. Around 9 December 1805 comet Biela passed about from Earth. After the 1805 apparition a number of attempts were made by Gauss (1806) and Bessel (1806) to calculate a definitive orbit. Gauss and Olbers both noted a similarity between the 1805 and 1772 comets but they were not able to prove a link.

==Confirmation as periodic==

It was Wilhelm von Biela, an army officer serving at the fortress town of Josefstadt, who observed the comet during its 1826 perihelion approach (on February 27) and calculated its orbit, discovering it to be periodic with a period of 6.6 years. At the time it was only the third comet known to be periodic, after comets Halley and Encke. The comet was named after Biela, although there was initially some controversy due to a later but independent discovery by Jean-Félix Adolphe Gambart, who also provided the first mathematical proof linking the 1826 and 1805 comets (letters from Biela and Gambart were published in the same issue of the &quot;Astronomische Nachrichten&quot;). A third claim was made by Thomas Clausen, who had independently linked the comets.

The comet appeared as predicted during its 1832 apparition, when it was first recovered by John Herschel on 24 September. The orbital elements and ephemeris calculated by Olbers for this return created something of a popular sensation, as they showed that the comet&#x27;s coma would likely pass through the Earth&#x27;s orbit around October 29, but at an Earth distance of about . Subsequent predictions, in the media of the time, of the Earth&#x27;s likely destruction overlooked the fact that the Earth itself would not reach this point until November 30, a month later, as pointed out by François Arago in an article designed to allay public fears. Despite this, the fact that Biela&#x27;s Comet was the only comet known to intersect the Earth&#x27;s orbit was to make it of particular interest, both to astronomers and the public, during the 19th century.

In 1832, Greek-Austrian astronomer Georgios Konstantinos Vouris published his own calculations of the elliptical orbit of the comet entitled: &quot;Elliptical orbit calculation of Biela&#x27;s Comet from 96 observations of the year 1832 (Elliptische bahnbere chung des Biela&#x27;schen cometen aus 96 beobachtungen des Jahres 1832)&quot;. His article was a comprehensive overview of the elliptical orbit of Biela&#x27;s Comet.

The 1839 apparition was extremely unfavourable and no observations were made as the comet never came closer than 1.8 AU from Earth since the comet was on the other side of the Sun. During 1839 the comet never had a solar elongation greater than 50 degrees.

== Disintegration ==
As of 1832, comet Biela had an Earth-MOID (Minimum orbit intersection distance) of only . The comet was rediscovered on November 26, 1845, by Francesco de Vico. Initially sporting small, faint nebulosities, subsequent observations showed that something remarkable had happened to it. Matthew Fontaine Maury, observing on 14 January 1846, noted that an apparent companion was located 1 arc minute north of the comet. After this announcement many astronomers began observing the comet, and noted that the two elements (usually referred to as &quot;Comet A&quot; and &quot;Comet B&quot; in modern nomenclature) alternated in brightness, developing parallel tails as they approached perihelion. Some observations indicated an &quot;archway of cometary matter&quot; extending between the two nuclei, which might suggest that the comet had split into many more pieces than two, but were simply too faint to be observed individually.

In 1852, the comet was again rediscovered more or less as predicted, with &quot;Comet A&quot; being rediscovered first, by Angelo Secchi on August 26. &quot;Comet B&quot; was finally relocated on September 16, and once again both nuclei alternated in brightness during the period of observation. &quot;A&quot; was last detected on this apparition on September 26 and &quot;B&quot; on September 29, in both cases by Otto Wilhelm Struve. Subsequent orbital calculations indicated that the nuclei had probably split around 500 days before the 1845 apparition, though more recent work has determined that it may have occurred near aphelion in late 1842.

Neither part could be found on their predicted periodic returns in 1859 (in any case an unfavorable return for viewing), 1865, or 1872. However, on November 27, 1872, a brilliant meteor shower (3,000 per hour) was observed radiating from the part of the sky where the comet had been predicted to cross in September 1872. This was the date when Earth intersected the 1839 and 1846 meteoroid streams. These meteors became known as the Andromedids or &quot;Bielids&quot; and it seems apparent that they were produced by the breakup of the comet. The meteors were seen again on subsequent occasions for the rest of the 19th century, but have now faded away, due to gravitational perturbations moving the node outside of Earth&#x27;s orbit.

==Possible observations and searches==

There were, however, inconclusive observations during the 1865 and 1872 returns. Charles Talmage, using ephemerides provided by John Russell Hind, claimed to have briefly observed a nebulous object in approximately the right position in November 1865. James Buckingham also observed two nebulosities in 1865 after studying Hind&#x27;s predictions, but Hind subsequently stated that they were unlikely to be Biela&#x27;s Comet, as they were much closer together than the two components of the comet should have been. A puzzling observation recorded as X/1872 X1, seen by N. R. Pogson in late 1872 from the Madras Observatory, was also speculated to be a recovery of Biela&#x27;s Comet, though once again this was later shown to have been unlikely.

Despite the apparent destruction of the comet, there were a number of searches for it during the later 20th century. Brian G. Marsden and Zdeněk Sekanina attempted to calculate a likely orbit for any remaining parts of the comet; it was during a search using Marsden&#x27;s calculations that Luboš Kohoutek discovered Comet Kohoutek. It has been calculated that the mass of the debris left in the Andromedid meteor stream is still much less than the total mass of the comet. Given that it is more likely that the main mass loss occurred near aphelion &quot;before&quot; the 1845 apparition, it seems possible that fragment A at least may still exist as a &#x27;dormant&#x27; comet.

There have been several attempts to identify objects discovered subsequently either as Biela&#x27;s Comet or as a remnant of it. The German astronomer Karl Ristenpart attempted several times to prove a link with the comet now known as 18D/Perrine-Mrkos, which had a very similar orbit to Biela apart from a differing Argument of Perihelion. Despite this, it was not possible to prove any relationship and Perrine-Mrkos, an intrinsically faint object, has itself since been lost. Comet 207P/NEAT (P/2001 J1), discovered in 2001 by the NEAT asteroid survey, was also found to have a similar orbit to Biela&#x27;s Comet, and it was initially thought possible that it was in some way related to it.

=== 2023 ===

Propagating the very dated orbit from the 1800s, there is speculation that Biela could pass around from Earth in late October 2023 and come to perihelion in December 2023, but Biela could just as easily be out by the orbit of Jupiter. The 1649 meteoroid stream is expected to generate a modest increase in the December 2023 activity of the Andromedids.

== Meteoric impacts ==

Biela has sometimes been proposed as the source of meteoric impacts on Earth.

A fringe theory links together several major fires that occurred simultaneously in America, including the Great Chicago Fire, the Great Michigan Fire, and the Peshtigo Fire, claiming that they were caused by fragments of Biela&#x27;s Comet striking the Earth, in October 1871. The theory was first proposed by Ignatius L. Donnelly in 1883, and was revived in a 1985 book and further explored in an unpublished 2004 scientific paper. However, experts dispute such a scenario - meteorites in fact are cold to the touch when they reach the Earth&#x27;s surface, and there are no credible reports of any fire anywhere having been started by a meteorite. Given the low tensile strength of such bodies, if a fragment of an icy comet were to strike the Earth, the most likely outcome would be for it to disintegrate in the upper atmosphere, leading to a meteor air burst.

On November 27, 1885, an iron meteorite fell in northern Mexico, at the same time as a 15,000 per hour outburst of the Andromedid meteor shower. The Mazapil meteorite has sometimes been attributed to the comet, but this idea has been out of favor since the 1950s as the processes of differentiation required to produce an iron body are not believed to occur in comets.

==Importance in the history of the concept of luminiferous ether==

Biela&#x27;s Comet (and Comet Encke) had a role in the now-discredited concept of &quot;luminiferous aether&quot;: its orbit was found to be shrinking in size, which was ascribed to the drag of an ether through which it orbited.

<text>Drake University is a private university in Des Moines, Iowa, United States. The University offers over 140 undergraduate and graduate programs, including professional programs in business, education, law, and pharmacy. Drake University Law School was founded in 1865, which makes it one of the 25 oldest law schools in the United States.

==History==
Drake University was founded in March 1881 by George T. Carpenter, a teacher and pastor, and Francis Marion Drake, a Union general during the Civil War. Drake was originally affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) at its founding, but the religious affiliation was terminated in 1907. The first classes convened in 1881, with 77 students and one building constructed, Student&#x27;s Home.

In 1883, the first permanent building, Old Main, was completed. Old Main remains prominent on campus, housing administration offices, Levitt Hall, and Sheslow Auditorium, and as the site of many United States presidential debates and other events. The university&#x27;s law school–the second oldest law school in the country west of the Mississippi River, after Saint Louis University School of Law–was established in 1865, by Chester C. Cole, who served on the Iowa Supreme Court from 1864 to 1876. Drake&#x27;s first international students enrolled for classes in 1886, and were citizens of China, Persia, Armenia, and Japan. The first campus library opened on June 16, 1908. In 1920, due to a housing crisis, the university allowed social fraternities to use Greek letter emblems and affiliate with national offices.

The College of Education evolved out of the 1888 purchase of Callanan College of Women. In 1893, that Callanan entity became known as the Normal College, preparing students to be teachers until 1906. It was renamed as the School of Education or alternatively, as the College of Education between 1906 and 1987. The School of Education serves more than 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students.

Drake&#x27;s law school, one of the 25 oldest law schools in the nation, traces its history to 1865. It is a charter member of the Association of American Law Schools; has been accredited since 1923, when accreditation began; and is one of only 75 ABA-approved law schools with a chapter of the Order of the Coif. Drake University Law School is home to the American Judicature Society; the archives of the National Bar Association, the nation&#x27;s oldest and largest national association of predominately African American lawyers and judges; and the Drake Constitutional Law Center, one of only four constitutional law programs established by the U.S. Congress and funded by the federal government.

In 1887, the Iowa College of Pharmacy affiliated with Drake University and operated as one of the colleges of the university, until 1906, when it was discontinued. Drake was without a pharmacy school until 1939, when the Des Moines College of Pharmacy Corporation, which separated from Des Moines University in 1927, was dissolved and the college&#x27;s staff and facilities became part of Drake University.

In 1931, the women&#x27;s dormitory opened—the first on-campus student residence built since the university&#x27;s founding. In 1937, ground was broken on commencement day for Cowles Library, now the university&#x27;s primary library. In 1939, a new men&#x27;s dormitory was completed, which included a student union, dubbed &quot;The Kennel&quot;. In 1963, Kirk Residence Hall opened, then Meredith Hall opened, in 1965, opening the door for the College of Liberal Arts and the School of Journalism. During the height of nationwide student protests in 1970–culminating in the Student Strike of 1970–a bomb exploded inside Harvey Ingham Hall. No one was injured, but windows were shattered in nearby Meredith, Fitch and Herriott Halls. Ingham was decimated but repaired. The largest building on campus, the Harmon Fine Arts Center, opened in 1972. The Olmsted Center, Drake&#x27;s student union building, opened in 1974.

On September 17, 1969, the Drake student newspaper, &quot;The Times-Delphic&quot;, published what appears to be the first documented account of the Paul is dead hoax. No articles published prior to this piece about the supposed death of Paul McCartney are evidenced, although fellow &quot;Times-Delphic&quot; reporter and musician Dartanyan Brown, one of the sources for the article, recalled hearing about the hoax from other musicians and reading about it in some underground newspapers.

In 1992, the Knapp Center opened as home to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams, and the women&#x27;s volleyball team. It contains four racquetball courts, five basketball and volleyball courts, a 200-meter track, and a weight training center. The facility hosted President Bill Clinton in 1996.

In September 2010, Drake launched the distinctly Drake Campaign to support its successful $200 million capital fundraising campaign to become &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s very best institutions of higher learning.&quot;

In 2013, Drake University became the home of The Harkin Institute for Public Policy &amp; Citizen Engagement.

==Academics==
The university is organized into 7 colleges and schools:

* College of Arts &amp; Sciences
* Zimpleman College of Business

==Student life==
Drake features over 160 student organizations, which including several fraternities and sororities.

The School of Journalism &amp; Mass Communication (SJMC) magazine program has achieved national prominence. The Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communication (ACEJMC) team that visited in 1999 termed Drake&#x27;s Magazines program the strongest undergraduate sequence in the country. In 2007, Drake student magazines &quot;THiNK&quot; and &quot;515&quot; won Pacemaker Awards.

===History===
In 1885, baseball became the university&#x27;s first varsity sport, followed by football and track.

In 1904, Drake organized a women&#x27;s basketball team, but Mary Carpenter, the first Dean of Women, banned the team as &quot;not appropriate&quot; for women.

Also in 1904, the athletic teams received their nickname of Bulldogs from a sportswriter who noticed that John L. Griffith, who coached every sport, was bringing his pet bulldogs to the practice fields. The teams had previously been known as the Ducklings and Ganders.

On October 11, 1905, Drake&#x27;s first football field, Haskins Field, opened with a 17–0 loss to Iowa.

In 1928, Drake&#x27;s football history continued when Drake defeated Simpson College 41–6 in what is believed to be the first night football game west of the Mississippi River. Perhaps the most famous incident in Drake&#x27;s football history is known as the Johnny Bright Incident, where Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs in the &quot;Des Moines Register&quot; proved an intentional attack on the African American quarterback by Oklahoma A&amp;M football players (Oklahoma A&amp;M became Oklahoma State in 1957).

In 1969, Drake&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team reached the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. Top-seeded UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s basketball and its 7-foot megastar Lew Alcindor (later Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) barely escaped an upset in the national semifinals, 85–82.

In 1973, nearly 70 years after the original women&#x27;s basketball team had been banned, Drake established a department of Women&#x27;s Intercollegiate Athletics.

In 1981, senior Lewis Lloyd, the nation&#x27;s second-leading scorer in Division I men&#x27;s basketball, was named a first-team All-American. Drafted by the Houston Rockets, Lloyd went on to an eight-year NBA career.

In 1982, the first year of the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament, Drake came within one step of the Final Four.
===Drake Relays===

Drake&#x27;s most famous event, the Drake Relays, began in 1910 in a blizzard with fewer than 100 participants. In 1935 Jesse Owens set an American broad jump record (26 feet 1-3/4 inches) at the Drake Relays. Today, the Drake Relays draws athletes from all over the world, including Olympians. It is common to see Relays participants compete in the Summer Olympics and vice versa. Students&#x27; kick-off the Relays in the annual tradition of street painting, in which student organizations colorfully decorate areas of Carpenter Avenue near the center of campus under a common theme.

<text>Meteor Mobile Communications Limited was a GSM and UMTS mobile telecommunications company in Ireland. They operated a GSM/GPRS/EDGE/UMTS(HSPA+) and LTE cellular communications network under licence from the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), and were the third entrant in the market, after Vodafone Ireland and Three Ireland. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Irish telecoms network Eir, having been purchased for €420m in 2005. Meteor was the only Irish owned mobile operator in Ireland. 
Meteor once issued new numbers with the prefix code 085. Since the introduction of full mobile number portability in Ireland, access codes have become less relevant as mobile telephone users may now retain their mobile telephone numbers when moving between mobile network operators. As a result, Meteor customers could have numbers starting with the codes 083, 085, 086, 087, or 089.

As of September 2008, Meteor had over 1 million customers, or 20% of the market.

==History==

===Award of licence===
In 1998, the then Director of Telecommunications Regulation held a competition to award the third mobile telecommunications licence. Two companies submitted bids for the licence, Orange, then controlled by Hutchinson Whampoa, and Meteor Mobile Communications (consisting at that point of Western Wireless, RF Communications Limited, and TWG Ireland LLC). On 19 June 1998 it was announced that Meteor had been ranked first in the competition. However, Orange took legal action against the Director to prevent the licence being awarded. This legal action ultimately failed and on 29 June 2000 Meteor were finally issued with the third mobile telecommunications licence.

===Launch===
Under Peter Quinn, Western Wireless International&#x27;s VP of European Operations and Meteor&#x27;s first CEO, Meteor launched on 22 February 2001, eight months after the High Court found in favor of their license over Orange. Uniquely, at the time, Billpay and prepaid customers could join without contracts and at the same cost of entry. Meteor slowly picked up a low (under 10%) share of the Irish market. However, they became profitable in their first year of operation and picked up much of the lucrative pre-paid market among teenagers, due to low SMS rates and promotions such as free Meteor-to-Meteor text messages.

In 2004, Western Wireless International bought out the remaining minority shareholders in the consortium, and it became a wholly owned subsidiary of that company.

===Acquisition by eircom===

In early 2005 several Irish newspapers reported that Western Wireless had been approached with a view to selling Meteor. On 9 July 2005 it was reported by The Irish Times that there had been three bidders for Meteor: eircom, Smart Telecom, and a consortium led by Denis O&#x27;Brien. It was considered that the probability of eircom winning, was looking increasingly unlikely due to their heavy debt of approximately €1.9 billion. It seemed unlikely they could afford it, should the price have topped €400 million. However, on 14 July 2005, RTÉ News reported on their business website that Denis O&#x27;Brien had withdrawn from bidding, and that it was understood that eircom was the top bidder at €410m. On 21 July it was announced that Smart Telecom had also withdrawn, leaving eircom as the sole bidder. On 25 July eircom announced that it had agreed to purchase the company for €420m. On 18 November 2005 the Competition Authority approved, subject to conditions (primarily, that separate accounts continue to be published for Meteor). The purchase was completed on 23 November 2005.

==Rapid growth==
In a report by eircom, Meteor had gained an 18.9% share of the mobile market in Ireland, with a customer base of over 962,000 of which over 100,000 (12%) were post paid subscribers under the Meteor BillPay brand. The company&#x27;s subscriber base had increased to over one million as of September 2008. Meteor accounted for 66% of the overall growth of the Irish mobile market in the year to September 2006.
The company worked closely with Eircom in upgrading its billing systems and deploying EDGE and 3G technology on its network. With the developments in eircom&#x27;s acceptance of the fourth 3G licence from ComReg, Meteor was obliged to have 33% of the population covered with commercial roll out of 3G services in October 2007. Meteor also signed a deal with T-Mobile UK which saw T-Mobile UK contract customers being offered a flat rate £0.25 for calls made while roaming on the Meteor network in Ireland. On 21 September 2006 Meteor announced the abolition of charges to receive calls while in the UK, by signing a deal with T-Mobile UK.

==Appointment of examiner==
On 29 March 2012, a number of companies within the eir group, including Meteor, petitioned the Irish High Court for the appointment of an examiner.

==Products and services==
Meteor initially started out as a value-driven mobile service offering customers basic mobile voice telephony and text-based SMS services to mostly Pay and Go customers.

The company offered mobile services, such as MMS, GPRS, EDGE and 3G through their Pay as You Go and Bill Pay brands. 
In 2009 Meteor launched Bill Pay Lite. It offered short contracts and low monthly fees.

In February 2009 Meteor launched Broadband To Go, its mobile broadband offering. The service offered internet at HSDPA speeds and was available to Bill Pay and Pay as You Go customers. There were 3 different products on bill pay, with download allowances of 5GB, 10GB and 15GB. The Pay as you go service offered 7.5GB.

&quot;Meteor Mobile Internet&quot; was the company&#x27;s mobile internet based services, offering access to the mobile internet, realtones, full track music downloads and other content available for download to existing customers.

&quot;Meteor Business&quot; was the company&#x27;s division focusing on business customers. They offered services such as Mobile Email using Visto technology, Microsoft Windows Mobile Email and other products.

=== 4G - LTE ===
Meteor (along with its sister company, eMobile), provided 4G. 4G was originally only available in Dublin, Carlow, Cork, Clare, Limerick, Galway, Mullingar, Athlone and Dundalk. Meteor claimed to have 90% 4G population coverage across Ireland and had planned to cover the country with 90% geographic coverage by April 2017.

==eir Mobile (MNO) (former MVNO)==
As part of their mobile strategy eir and Meteor also launched &quot;eir Mobile&quot; aimed at the older residential and business market. This was complementary to the now discontinued Meteor brand (mainly used by younger residential wireless customers). eir Mobile was a mobile virtual network operator MVNO which used the Meteor Network for its services to residential and business customers, to complement the residential and business mobile services offered by Meteor. It is now a Mobile network operator with 96% 4G coverage, as well as 99% 3G population coverage as of September 2017, when it became the successor to Meteor Mobile.

==Network==
Meteor previously had a national roaming agreement with O2 Ireland which meant that, only on the westernmost areas of Ireland (where Meteor did not have coverage), a Meteor customer could use O2 Ireland&#x27;s network at no extra charge. This deal expired in February 2007. The final arrangement allowed Meteor customers access to the Vodafone Ireland network on the western-seabord of Ireland.

Like all other Irish operators, Meteor held a UMTS licence. They had offered nationwide 3G services from 2007, but the Meteor 3G network was available to 33% of the Irish population (this included the four cities of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and other regional centres) with very limited geographic coverage, around 15% by 2013.

They also offered GPRS (2.5G) and EDGE (2.75G) services. Their parent eir won a bid for the final 3G licence, when their parent, eircom accepted this, because, Smart Mobile Ltd. was unable to pay for the license. Meteor continued to add EDGE capabilities to their then existing 2G network. In order to comply with the terms of licence, Meteor launched stage one (10% 3G population coverage area) from their UMTS/HSDPA Network on the end of October 2007, with the second phase having gone live to customers at the end of September 2008.

Meteor&#x27;s network also offered 4G services, which covered 96% of the Irish population. Meteor had Ireland&#x27;s second largest 4G footprint after Vodafone.

The legal transfer of licence for UMTS services from Meteor&#x27;s parent, eircom, was officially authorised on 26 June 2008 taking effect the following day.

==Meteor Ireland Music Awards==
Meteor sponsored Ireland&#x27;s national music awards annually, becoming known at one point as &quot;The Meteors&quot;, until their cancellation in 2011.

==Sponsorship==
Meteor sponsored RTÉ One&#x27;s travel show &quot;No Frontiers&quot; and the second season of TV3&#x27;s &quot;The Apprentice&quot;. They have since removed their sponsorship of &quot;The Apprentice&quot;, while RTÉ have since replaced &quot;No Frontiers&quot; with a new holiday show, &quot;Getaways&quot;.

==Copyright Enforcement==
On the 1st of September 2009, Meteor and eircom began regulating access to the Pirate Bay with a &quot;three strike&quot; system, in compliance with a High Court order issued to eircom as a result of a court case between themselves and the Irish Recorded Music Association. This system was challenged by the Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) in 2010, but was overruled by the High Court. The DPC issued an order to eircom to halt this system in 2011, citing a ruling by the European Court of Justice. They continued to voluntarily completely block access to the Pirate Bay for some time after, however eircom does not block the Pirate Bay as of 2024.

<doc id="632120" wikidata="Q1854663" url="?curid=632120" title="List of regiments of foot">
<text>This is a list of numbered regiments of foot of the British Army from the mid-18th century until 1881, when numbering was abandoned. &quot;Foot&quot; was the contemporary term for &quot;infantry&quot;.

==Introduction==

===Rank and numbering===

====Establishment of precedence====
The rank of regiments of the English Army was first fixed during the Nine Years&#x27; War. Doubts as to the respective rank of regiments fighting in the Spanish Netherlands led William III to command a Board of General Officers meeting on 10 June 1694 to establish the order of precedence of the various units.

With the union of the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form the Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707 the British Army came into existence (see Creation of British Army). The order of seniority for the most senior line regiments in the British Army is based on the order of seniority in the English army. Scottish and Irish regiments were only allowed to take a rank in the English army from the date of their arrival in England or the date when they were first placed on the English establishment.

The rank or precedence of regiments was fixed by the following criteria:
*English regiments, raised in England, should rank from their date of raising
*English, Scots and Irish regiments, raised for service of a foreign power, should rank from the date that they came onto the English establishment

This led to anomalies, such as the Royal Irish Regiment, raised in 1684, being ranked as the 18th of the line, junior to eleven regiments raised between 1685 and 1688. Similarly, the Coldstream Guards is the oldest continuously serving regular regiment in the British Army. However, this regiment was placed as the second senior regiment as it entered the service of the Crown after the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards. (The Coldstream answered by adopting the motto &quot;Nulli Secundus&quot;—&quot;Second to None&quot;.)

====Numbering====
While regiments were known by the name of their colonel, or by their royal title, the number of their rank was increasingly used. Thus, in the &quot;Cloathing Book&quot; of 1742, which illustrated the patterns of uniforms worn by the King&#x27;s forces, the regiments of foot are designated simply by numbers.

The substitution of numbers for names was completed by a clothing regulation of 1747 and a royal warrant of 1751. The 1747 document, which used numbers for the regiments throughout, decreed that no colonel was &quot;to put his Arms, Crest, Device or Livery on any part of the Appointments of the Regiment under his command.&quot; Furthermore, in the centre of the regiment&#x27;s colours was to be &quot;painted or embroidered in gold Roman characters the number of the Rank of the Regiment&quot;. The warrant, dated 1 July 1751, repeated the instructions of the 1747 regulation and provided that regiments should in future be known by their numbers only.

As the size of the army expanded and contracted during the various conflicts of the 18th and 19th centuries, junior regiments were raised and disbanded. Accordingly, there were often a number of different regiments that bore the same number at different periods. Additionally, there were occasional partial renumberings. For instance, in 1816 the 95th (Rifle) Regiment of Foot was renamed the &quot;Rifle Brigade&quot;, without a number. The existing 96th–103rd regiments were redesignated as the 95th–102nd.

====Childers reforms====
With modifications the numbers existed until 1881, when the Childers Reforms introduced &quot;territorialisation&quot;. From 1 July 1881 the United Kingdom was divided into regimental districts, each allocated a two-battalion regiment, usually bearing a &quot;county&quot; title. Regimental numbers were abandoned: the 1st to 25th foot, which already had two battalions adopted new titles. The remaining regiments were paired to become the 1st or 2nd battalions of the new regiments. Two rifle regiments: the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (ex 60th Foot) and the Rifle Brigade, who had four battalions each, recruited nationally.

Although the numbers were officially abolished in 1881, in some cases they continued to be used informally within the regiments. The regimental system introduced in 1881 was to last for more than seventy years. When new regiments were formed by amalgamation from 1958 onwards, the old regimental numbers were sometimes reintroduced into their titles. Examples are the 3rd East Anglian Regiment (16th/44th Foot), Worcestershire and Sherwood Foresters Regiment (29th/45th Foot).

===Royal and subsidiary titles===
The 1751 warrant confirmed the royal titles or other special designations of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 7th, 8th, 18th, 21st, 23rd, 27th and 41st regiments. In later years, other regiments were allowed to bear the names of the monarch or other members of the Royal family. Only one regiment, the 33rd Foot, was allowed to bear the name of a person other than Royalty when it became the &quot;Duke of Wellington&#x27;s&quot; in 1853, the year after the death of the First Duke, who had served as a subaltern in the regiment.

====County affiliations====
On 21 August 1782, the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, Henry Seymour Conway, issued a regulation giving an English county designation to each regiment of foot other than those with a royal title or highland regiments. The intention was to improve recruitment during the unpopular American War of Independence, and the Home Secretary, Thomas Townshend issued a circular letter to the lieutenants of each county in England in the following terms:
My Lord, The very great deficiency of men in the regiments of infantry being so very detrimental to the public service, the king has thought proper to give the names of the different counties to the old corps, in hopes that, by the zeal and activity of the principal nobility and gentry in the several counties, some considerable assistance may be given towards recruiting these regiments&quot;.
The names of the counties were added to the regimental titles in parentheses, ranging from the 3rd (Buffs – East Kent) Regiment of Foot to the 70th (Surrey) Regiment of Foot. In some cases more than one regiment was allocated to a county, for example, the 38th (1st Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot and 64th (2nd Staffordshire) Regiment of Foot. The attempt to link regimental areas to specific counties was found to be impractical, with regiments preferring to recruit from major centres of population. By June 1783 each regiment was again recruiting throughout the country, although the county names were to remain. In a few cases, affiliations were altered: for example the 14th and 16th Foot &quot;exchanged&quot; counties in 1809.

====Fusiliers, light infantry and rifles====
*Fusiliers: The 7th, 21st and 23rd foot had borne the title of fusiliers for some time before 1751. These regiments had originally been armed with flintlocks (or &quot;fusils&quot;, from the French), rather than matchlocks. Later, the &quot;fusilier&quot; title was granted as a purely honorary distinction to the 87th Foot in 1827 and to the 5th Foot in 1836. The 101st to 104th Fusiliers joined the British Army from the Honourable East India Company (HEIC) in 1861.
*Light infantry: During the Napoleonic Wars it was decided to convert a number of line regiments to light infantry, and in 1803 the 43rd and 52nd foot were accordingly redesignated as the 43rd (Monmouthshire Light Infantry) Regiment of Foot and 52nd (Oxfordshire Light Infantry) Regiment of Foot. In the next few years the 13th, 51st, 68th, 85th and 90th foot were converted to light infantry. By the middle of the 19th century the title of &quot;light infantry&quot; was largely an honorary one, reflected by the &quot;elevation&quot; of the 32nd Foot to light infantry in 1858 to recognise their gallantry in the Siege of Lucknow. Two more light infantry regiments subsequently joined the British Army, as the 105th and 106th regiments, transferred from the HEIC in 1861.
*Rifle regiments: An experimental corps of riflemen, equipped with Baker rifles and clothed in rifle green uniforms, was formed in 1800, and numbered as the 95th foot in 1802. The 60th Foot, which had some rifle battalions, was converted to rifles in 1824.

<text>The Reconstruction Acts, or the Military Reconstruction Acts (March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 428-430, c.153; March 23, 1867, 15 Stat. 2-5, c.6; July 19, 1867, 15 Stat. 14-16, c.30; and March 11, 1868, 15 Stat. 41, c.25), were four statutes passed during the Reconstruction Era by the 40th United States Congress addressing the requirement for Southern States to be readmitted to the Union. The actual title of the initial legislation was &quot;An act to provide for the more efficient government of the Rebel States&quot; and was passed on March 4, 1867. Fulfillment of the requirements of the Acts was necessary for the former Confederate States to be readmitted to the Union from military and Federal control imposed during and after the American Civil War. The Acts excluded Tennessee, which had already ratified the 14th Amendment and had been readmitted to the Union on July 24, 1866.

== Background ==
Reconstruction first began under the Union Army, which implemented policies conducive to their military goals. The succession of Andrew Johnson to the Presidency following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln was initially supported by Radicals in Congress, who thought Johnson&#x27;s policies would be more punitive and far reaching than Lincoln&#x27;s. However, the Radicals disapproved of how Johnson took a conciliatory approach and inflicted almost no punishment on the South, and how Johnson permitted Southern states to pass the Black Codes and to elect former Confederates to Congress. Johnson sought to finish Reconstruction by December 1865, before Congress would meet again. When Congress met in 1866, they overturned all of the President&#x27;s decisions related to reconstruction, barring delegations from the Southern States from entering the Congress, and passing the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau Bill and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, both over Johnson&#x27;s veto. Johnson&#x27;s hostility to Congressional plans led to growing discontent in Congress with his administration. The midterm elections of 1866 produced a resounding endorsement of Radical policy and a rejection of Johnson&#x27;s, effectively leaving Johnson powerless to slow down the plans of the Radical Congress. Support grew among Congressional Republicans to wipe away the current Johnson state governments and their abuses and to create new governments.

==History==
The passage of the Reconstruction Acts marks the beginning of Congressional Reconstruction. The Acts set forth the requirements for the late rebel states to regain entry into the Union. For reentry, each state had to draft a new state constitution, which would have to be approved by Congress. These constitutions would have to enfranchise the freedmen and abolish the Black Codes. A key addition of the Acts included the creation of five military districts in the South, each commanded by a general, which would serve as the highest authority for the region, though few generals were actively involved in day-to-day affairs, especially after new constitutions were passed. The states were also required to ratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. President Andrew Johnson&#x27;s vetoes of these measures were overridden by Congress. The Military Reconstruction Acts served to greatly increase the power of the Federal government over that of the States, and were perceived by most Southerners as justifying antebellum worries about the potential of Northern sectional dominance leading into the Civil War.

Each Military Reconstruction Act had slightly different requirements for readmission to the Union, and were successively passed in response to various political developments in the Southern States. For example, the earlier acts required that the new State Constitutions be approved by a popular vote, earning the approval of a majority of the population registered to vote (mostly freed blacks and non-confederate whites). In Mississippi, where the State&#x27;s proposed Constitution was overwhelmingly hated by the public, the opponents of the new Constitution refused to vote, making it impossible for a majority of registered voters to approve of the State Constitution. In response, the Radical Congress passed another Reconstruction Act, changing the requirement for a new Constitution to require only a majority of actual voters to approve. Because opponents of the Reconstruction Constitution didn&#x27;t vote, the majority of actual voters were in favor, and the Constitution was automatically ratified. Congressional actions like this served to drastically lower the trust of Southerners in the Federal Government.

General George Meade (of the Third Military District) appointed Brig. General Thomas H. Ruger
to replace Governor of Georgia Charles J. Jenkins, who had been elected as the only candidate in 1865 to succeed James Johnson, who had been appointed by President Andrew Johnson.

After &quot;Ex parte McCardle&quot; (1869) came before the United States Supreme Court, Congress feared that the Court might strike the Reconstruction Acts down as unconstitutional. To prevent this, Congress repealed the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, eliminating the Supreme Court&#x27;s jurisdiction over the case.

<doc id="632126" wikidata="Q329884" url="?curid=632126" title="Arnhem Land">
<text>Arnhem Land is a historical region of the Northern Territory of Australia. It is located in the north-eastern corner of the territory and is around from the territorial capital, Darwin. In 1623, Dutch East India Company captain Willem Joosten van Colster (or Coolsteerdt) sailed into the Gulf of Carpentaria and Cape Arnhem is named after his ship, the &quot;Arnhem&quot;, which itself was named after the city of Arnhem in the Netherlands.

The area covers about and has an estimated population of 16,000, of whom 12,000 are Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Two regions are often distinguished as East Arnhem (Land) and West Arnhem (Land). The region&#x27;s service hub is Nhulunbuy, east of Darwin, set up in the early 1970s as a mining town 
for bauxite. Other major population centres are Yirrkala (just outside Nhulunbuy), Gunbalanya (formerly Oenpelli), Ramingining, and Maningrida.

A substantial proportion of the population, which is mostly Aboriginal, lives on small outstations or homelands. This outstation movement started in the early 1980s. Many Aboriginal groups moved to usually very small settlements on their traditional lands, often to escape the problems of the larger towns. These population groups have very little Western cultural influence, and Arnhem Land is arguably one of the last areas in Australia that could be seen as a completely separate country. Many of the region&#x27;s leaders have called and continue to call for a treaty that would allow the Yolŋu to operate under their own traditional laws.

In 2013–14, the entire region contributed around or 7 percent to the Northern Territory&#x27;s gross state product, mainly through bauxite mining.

In 2019, it was announced that NASA had chosen Arnhem Land as the location for a space launch facility, the Arnhem Space Centre. On 27 June 2022, NASA launched the first rocket there, the first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US, and two further launches followed within weeks.

==History==

The Yolŋu culture in East Arnhem Land is one of the oldest living cultures on Earth, at around 60,000 years old. DNA studies have confirmed that &quot;Aboriginal Australians are one of the oldest living populations in the world, certainly the oldest outside of Africa&quot;; their descendants left the African continent 75,000 years ago. They may have the oldest continuous culture on earth. Oral histories comprising complex narratives have been passed down through hundreds of generations, and the Aboriginal rock art, dated by modern techniques, shows continuity of their culture.

Arnhem Land is the location of the oldest-known () stone axe of its kind, which scholars believe to be 35,500 years old. 

=== Prehistoric warfare ===
Rock art depicting what may be acts of violence between hunter-gatherers in Arnhem land has been tentatively dated to 10,000 years ago.

===Makassan contact===

At least since the 18th century (and probably earlier) Muslim traders from Makassar of Sulawesi visited Arnhem Land each year to trade, harvest, and process sea cucumbers or &quot;trepang&quot;. This marine animal is highly prized in Chinese cuisine, for folk medicine, and as an aphrodisiac.

This Makassan contact with Australia is the first recorded example of interaction between the inhabitants of the Australian continent and their Asian neighbours.
This contact had a major effect on local Aboriginal Australians. The Makassans exchanged goods such as cloth, tobacco, knives, rice, and alcohol for the right to &quot;trepang&quot; coastal waters and employ local labour. Makassar pidgin became a &quot;lingua franca&quot; along the north coast among several indigenous Australian groups who were brought into greater contact with each other by the seafaring Makassan culture.

These traders from the southwest corner of Sulawesi also introduced the word &quot;balanda&quot; for white people, long before western explorers set foot on the coasts of northern Australia. In Arnhem Land, the word is still widely used today to refer to white Australians. The Dutch started settling in Sulawesi Island in the early 17th century.

Archaeological remains of Makassar contact, including trepang processing plants (drying, smoking) from the 18th and 19th centuries, are still found at Australian locations such as Port Essington and Groote Eylandt. The Makassans also planted tamarind trees (native to Madagascar and East Africa). After processing, the sea cucumbers were traded by the Makassans to Southern China.

In 2014, an 18th-century Chinese coin was found in the remote area of Wessel Islands off the coast on a beach on Elcho Island during a historical expedition. The coin was found near previously known Makassan trepanger fishing sites where several other Dutch coins have been discovered nearby, but never a Chinese coin. The coin was probably made in Beijing around 1735.

===Florida Station===

In 1884, 10,000 square miles of Arnhem Land was sold by the colonial British government to cattle grazier, John Arthur Macartney. The property was called Florida Station and Macartney stocked it with cattle overlanded from Queensland. Monsoonal flooding, disease and strong resistance from the local Aboriginal population resulted in Florida Station being abandoned by Macartney in 1893. The first manager of the property, Jim Randell, bolted a swivel cannon to the verandah of the homestead to keep the Indigenous people away, while Jack Watson, the last manager of the property, reportedly &quot;wiped out a lot&quot; of &quot;the blacks&quot; living on the coast at Blue Mud Bay.
During the period of Watson&#x27;s management, another large massacre is recorded to have happened at Mirki on the north coast of Florida Station. The Yolngu people today remember this massacre where many people including children were shot dead.

===Eastern and African Cold Storage Supply Company===
From 1903 to 1908, the property rights of much of Arnhem Land were held by the Eastern and African Cold Storage Supply Company. This Anglo-Australian consortium leased the region under the name of Arafura cattle station and attempted to construct a massive cattle raising and meat production industry. The company employed roving gangs of armed men to shoot the resident Aboriginal population.

===Land rights===
In 1971, the Gove land rights case (&quot;Milirrpum v Nabalco Pty Ltd&quot;) was the first litigation on native title in Australia, and the first significant legal case for Aboriginal land rights in Australia.

==Geography==

The area is from Port Roper on the Gulf of Carpentaria around the coast to the East Alligator River, where it adjoins Kakadu National Park. The major centres are Jabiru on the Kakadu National Park border, Maningrida at the Liverpool River mouth, and Nhulunbuy (also known as Gove) in the far north-east, on the Gove Peninsula. Gove is the site of large-scale bauxite mining with an associated alumina refinery. Its administrative centre is the town of Nhulunbuy, the fourth-largest population centre in the Northern Territory.

The climate of Arnhem Land is tropical monsoon with a wet and dry season. The temperature has little seasonal variation; however, it can range from overnight lows of in the dry season (April to September) to daily highs of in the wet season (October to March).


==Indigenous population and culture==
In 1931, an area of was proclaimed as an Aboriginal reserve, named Arnhem Land Aboriginal Reserve. the Land Trust held about as Aboriginal freehold land (with the exception of mining leases); it remains one of the largest parcels of Aboriginal-owned land in Australia and is perhaps best known for its isolation, the art of its people, and the strong continuing traditions of its Aboriginal inhabitants.

Arnhem Land is composed of many different Aboriginal countries and language groups. North-east Arnhem Land is home to the Yolngu people, one of the largest Indigenous groups in Australia, who have succeeded in maintaining a vigorous traditional culture, and whose name for this area is Miwatj. In West Arnhem Land, large groups include the Bininj people and the Maung people of the Goulburn Islands.

In 2018, Kathy Guthadjaka AM (also known as Gotha) was awarded &#x27;NT Senior Australian of the Year.&#x27; Guthadjaka has conducted academic research into Aboriginal languages, knowledge, and culture.

==Economy==
In 2013–14, the entire region contributed around or 7% to the Northern Territory&#x27;s gross state product, mainly through bauxite mining.

In 2019, it was announced that NASA had chosen Arnhem Land as the location for a space launch facility. The Arnhem Space Centre was built near Nhulunbuy, employing mostly local labour, and on 27 June 2022, NASA launched the first rocket there, which was the first rocket launch from a commercial spaceport outside the US. Two further launches followed, the third on 11 July. Other space companies are interested in using the rocket launch pad, and NASA confirmed that it will use the facility again in the future.

==Film==
The 2006 film &quot;Ten Canoes&quot; captures life in Arnhem Land through a story tapping into the Aboriginal mythic past; it was co-directed by one of the indigenous cast members. The film and the documentary about the making of the film, &quot;The Balanda and the Bark Canoes&quot;, give a remarkable testimony to the indigenous struggle to keep their culture alive – or rather revive it in the wake of considerable relative modernisation and influence of white (&quot;balanda&quot;) cultural imposition.

&quot;High Ground (2020 film)&quot;, a 2020 feature film directed by Stephen Maxwell Johnson, based on historical fact and reflecting the history and culture of Yolngu people, was filmed in Arnhem land.

==Art==

The Aboriginal community of Yirrkala, just outside Nhulunbuy, is internationally known for bark paintings, promoting the rights of Indigenous Australians, and as the origin of the &quot;yidaki&quot;, or didgeridoo. The community of Gunbalanya (previously known as Oenpelli) in Western Arnhem Land is also notable for bark painting. The indigenous inhabitants also create temporary sand sculptures as part of their sacred rituals.

Arnhem Land is also notable for Aboriginal rock art, some examples of which can be found at Ubirr Rock, Injalak Hill, and in the Canon Hill area. Some of these record the early years of European explorers and settlers, sometimes in such detail that Martini–Henry rifles can be identified. They also depict axes, and detailed paintings of aircraft and ships. One remote shelter, several hundred kilometres from Darwin, has a painting of the wharf at Darwin, including building and boats, and Europeans with hats and pipes, some apparently without hands (which they have in their trouser pockets). Near the East Alligator River crossing, a figure was painted of a man carrying a gun and wearing his hair in long pigtails down his back, characteristic of the Chinese labourers brought to Darwin in the late 19th century.

One Yolngu prehistoric stone arrangement at Maccasans Beach near Yirrkala shows the layout of the Makassan &quot;praus&quot; used for &quot;trepang&quot; (sea cucumber) fishing in the area. This was a legacy of Yolngu trade links with the people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi. The trading relationship antedated European settlement by some 200 years.

Aboriginal artists in Arnhem Land are primarily represented by Aboriginal Art Centres, nonprofit, community-owned organisations. In East Arnhem Land, primarily Yolngu Matha-speaking artists are promoted by Buku-Larrnggay Mulka in Yirrkala, Bula&#x27;bula Arts in Ramingining, Elcho Island Arts and Crafts on Elcho Island, Gapuwiyak Culture and Arts in Gapuwiyak and Milingimbi Art and Culture on Milingimbi Island. In Central Arnhem Land, Maningrida Arts &amp; Culture in Maningrida promotes the work of a diverse range of Kuninjku, Burarra, and Gurrgoni artists, amongst others. In West Arnhem Land, Injalak Arts in Gunbalanya represents mainly Kunwinjku artists. Ngukurr Arts is located on the Roper River in Southern Arnhem Land. Art is also produced on the many islands of Arnhem Land, and there are art centres on the Anindilyakwa speaking Groote Eylandt (Anindilyakwa Art) and the Maung speaking Goulburn Islands (Mardbalk Arts &amp; Crafts).

==Homelands==
Arnhem Land is also known for embracing the homeland movement, sometimes referred to as the outstation movement. For many decades prior to 1970, the East Arnhem Land Yolngu people lived on mission stations, such as Yirrkala. From April 1972, Yolngu families began moving away, back to their traditional clan lands. This was instigated by Yolngu people, before there was government support for the outstation movement. The people cleared land for airstrips and built their own houses from local timber, with the help of non-Indigenous people from the mission. The elders of the clans aimed to determine their own futures, basing their societies on Yolngu law, while living and raising their children on their lands in a sustainable and self-sufficient way. In 1985, Laynhapuy Homelands Aboriginal Corporation (LHAC), an Aboriginal corporation, was established to assist the homelands.

Homelands are tiny communities where members of related clan groups live on their traditional land, living according to Yolngu rom (law). There are benefits to the people to be living in these homelands, including:

Homelands also reduce pressure on other Indigenous communities, which are already suffering from problems in the housing, health and education services areas.

In the early 21st century, a focus governments about the &quot;viability&quot; of the homelands has caused tensions and uncertainty within the Arnhem Land community.

In September 2008, then Darwin correspondent for &quot;The Age&quot;, Lindsay Murdoch, wrote: &quot;Elders tell of their fears that Yolngu culture and society will not survive if clans cannot continue to live on and access their land through homelands. They warn that if services are cut, many of the 800 people in the Laynhapuy homelands will be forced to move to towns such as Yirrkala on the Gove Peninsula, creating new law and order problems, while those who stay will be severely disadvantaged.&quot;

In response to changes made by the Northern Territory government surrounding reduced support for the homelands in 2009, the Indigenous leader Patrick Dodson criticised the Northern Territory Government&#x27;s controversial new policy on remote Aboriginal communities, describing it as a &quot;die on the vine&quot; plan that will &quot;slowly but surely&quot; kill indigenous culture.

Born in the 1930s, Dr. Gawirrin Gumana AO was a leader of the Dhalwangu clan, renowned for his artwork and knowledge of traditional culture and law. In May 2009, he had the following to say about the significance of the homelands to his people:
Despite facing government concerns and policy confusion, a number of people have developed commercial enterprises that have centred on using the best elements of their homelands. Indigenous tourism ventures incorporating the controlled use of homelands are now showing signs of success for a select number of Yolngu.

===Communities===

*Gan Gan, aka Gangan, is a remote inland riverside community, in the traditional lands of the Dhalwaŋu people. There are several well-known artists in the community, notably Malaluba Gumana, Nongirrnga Marawili, Gawarrin Gumana and Garawan Wanambi. Gan Gan is also the site of an event known as the Gan Gan massacre that occurred in 1911, when over 30 men, women and children were killed by colonial police and settlers.

<doc id="632127" wikidata="Q2102394" url="?curid=632127" title="Saser Kangri">
<text>Saser Kangri (or Sasir Kangri) is a mountain in India. It is the highest peak in the Saser Muztagh, the easternmost subrange of the Karakoram range. Sasir Kangri is located within Ladakh.

==Saser Kangri massif==

The Saser Kangri massif consists of six named peaks:
This massif lies toward the northwestern end of the Saser Muztagh, at the head of the North Shukpa Kunchang Glacier, a major glacier which drains the eastern slopes of the group. The Sakang and Pukpoche Glaciers head on the western side of the group, and drain into the Nubra River.

==Climbing history==

Early exploration and climbing attempts of Saser Kangri occurred on the western side, from the Nubra Valley; this is lower, more populated, and hence more easily accessible than the eastern side, which faces the Tibetan Plateau. Early European exploration included a visit in 1909 by explorer T. G. Longstaff, along with Arthur Neve and A. M. Slingsby. However, visits and failed climbing attempts by multiple groups on the western side over the period 1922-1970 showed that the western side was surprisingly difficult.

In 1973, an expedition of members of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police finally succeeded in making the first ascent of the peak, by a very different route. They approached the peak from the southeast, via the upper Shyok Valley and the North Shukpa Kunchang Glacier, a long and difficult journey. Only in 1987 did climbers succeed in ascending this peak from the western side: an Indian-British team led by V.Pandey and LS successfully climbed the peak in conjunction with the first ascent of Saser Kangri IV.

Saser Kangri II West was first climbed in 1984 by an Indo-Japanese team, who at the time, had believed the peak to be higher than Saser Kangri II East and only subsequently was it determined to be the lower of the two. Saser Kangri II East was first climbed by Mark Richey, Steve Swenson, and Freddie Wilkinson on August 24, 2011. Until then it was the world&#x27;s second highest unclimbed mountain after Gangkhar Puensum, and they won a 2012 Piolet d&#x27;Or for their ascent. 

Saser Kangri III was first climbed by an Indo-Tibetan Border Police expedition in 1986 using an eastern approach. The summit party consisted of the climbers: Budhiman, Neema Dorjee, Sher Singh, Tajwer Singh, Phurba Sherpa and Chhewang Somanla.

;Accident on Saser Kangri IV (2018)
Pemba Sherpa (45) of Darjeeling, India went missing after falling down into a crevasse on Saser Kangri IV on 13 July 2018. He was climbing the peak Saser Kangri IV (7416m) with a team of climbers led by Basanta Singha Roy from West Bengal and another team from Pune, India. On his way down from summit, Pemba fell down into a crevasse before reaching Camp-1 at an altitude of 5750m. No rescue effort has yielded any results; he remains inside the crevasse.

Recovery Attempt: A sustained effort of recovery process was carried out by Indian Armed Forces composed of soldiers from the ITBP (Indo-Tibetan Border Police) and Siachen Battle School between 15 July and 31 July. Indian Army from SBS reached the site on 24 July. Despite interruptions due to inclement weather, they did manage to go down as far as possible until the crevasse became too narrow to negotiate. Their efforts proved unsuccessful and they did not find any trace of Pemba Sherpa, but they did manage to recover his loaded rucksack weighing about 35 kg.

<doc id="632129" wikidata="Q5324029" url="?curid=632129" title="ERC (human resources organization)">
<text>ERC is Northeast Ohio&#x27;s largest organization providing Human Resources and workplace programs, practices, training and consulting. ERC also hosts the NorthCoast 99 program and sponsors the ERC Health insurance program. It is not uncommon for the media to quote ERC in their stories when looking for an authority on the subject. ERC&#x27;s mission is to assist organizations in attracting, retaining, and motivating top performing employees.

ERC was founded in July 1920 as the American Plan Association of Cleveland. One of the organization’s main goals was to promote open shop employment instead of the common closed shop practice, which meant an employer was either union or non-union, but could not hire some of each. Another early goal was to help reduce the number of strikes locally, and the organization claimed it was at least partially responsible for reducing the number of strikes in Cleveland from 41 in 1920 to 21 in 1922. In 1920 Cleveland had been one of the few large cities in the US without a general employer’s association, yet by 1922 the APA of Cleveland had grown to be one of the largest such organizations in the country. In 1930 the organization was renamed The Associated Industries of Cleveland, and in 1986 the name Employer&#x27;s Resource Council was coined. The organization is now more commonly referred to simply as ERC.

ERC is a current membership organization. Members of ERC receive access to salary, wage and benefits survey data, an HR Help Desk, online HR resources and tools, networking opportunities and cost savings through a network of preferred partners. ERC also offers employee and job training locally and nationally including Supervisory Training, Management, Leadership, HR topics, Soft Skills, Computer/Software, and Technical training.

<text>La Salle University () is a private, Catholic university in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The university was founded in 1863 by the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools and named for St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle.

==History==
===19th century===
La Salle College was founded in March 1863 as an all-male college by Brother Teliow and Archbishop James Wood of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia. It was first located at St. Michael&#x27;s Parish on N. 2nd Street in the Olde Kensington section of Philadelphia. La Salle soon moved to the building vacated by St. Joseph&#x27;s College at 1234 Filbert Street in Center City Philadelphia. In 1886, due to the development of the Center City district, La Salle moved to a third location, the former mansion of Michael Bouvier, the great-great-grandfather of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, at 1240 North Broad Street.

===20th century===
In 1930, due to space constraints, La Salle moved to its current campus at the intersection of 20th Street and Olney Avenue in the Logan neighborhood of the city. The new location had a suburban feel with ample land, but was linked to the city by trolleys and the newly constructed Broad Street Subway. The 1930s proved to be a tumultuous decade for La Salle, which was nearly bankrupt after being unable to sell the 1240 North Broad Street property. The main academic building on campus, College Hall was unable to be finished due to a lack of funds, and the college nearly closed in the late 1930s. The college&#x27;s closing was prevented by a 75th Anniversary Fund Drive in 1938, spearheaded by Philadelphia businessman John McCarthy. Funds raised from this drive also enabled La Salle to purchase a tract of land to the east of 19th Street, where Philadelphia had intended to build a city college.

During World War II, La Salle nearly closed again due to a lack of students, and the football team was disbanded due to a lack of players, but the college experienced a period of growth in the late 1940s. Several new buildings were constructed in the 1940s and 1950s, including a new library, student union, and a science building. It was also during this time that the first student residence halls were constructed at La Salle, mostly on land purchased from the former Belfield Country Club. Additional student housing was provided by purchasing or renting local homes, such as the house known as &quot;The Mansion&quot;, on David and Logan Blain&#x27;s Belfield Estate. During the 1960s, the high school section moved out due to the lack of space after many years of sharing the same campus with the College.

In 1970, La Salle admitted women to its regular classes, becoming a fully co-educational institution. A year later, La Salle opened Olney Hall (now known as Hayman Hall), its main academic building. It also continued to expand its property throughout the 1970s and 1980s, buying land along Chew Avenue in the Germantown section of the city, along with the Belfield Estate in 1984, and to the south of main-campus, the orphanage run by the Sisters of St. Basil the Great. In 1984, La Salle was granted University status. 

===21st century===

In 2007, La Salle acquired the former Germantown Hospital, now West Campus, and constructed The Shoppes at La Salle shopping center across the street in 2008. The construction of the Shoppes at La Salle and addition of The Fresh Grocer ended a decades-long food desert in Germantown.

In the Fall of 2005, the $26 million first phase of this master plan was completed with the construction of Tree Tops Cafe (dining hall) and St. Basil Court (Residence Hall). St. Basil&#x27;s houses approximately 430 students. Three of the building&#x27;s wings feature &quot;suites&quot;, in which four students share two bedrooms and one bathroom. The fourth wing&#x27;s rooms have the traditional one-room for housing two students with communal bathrooms. The facilities have lounges, study rooms, and special purpose rooms.

A $2.5 million athletic field renovation was completed in the Fall of 2006.

In May 2007, the university purchased adjacent Germantown Hospital for $10 million. The acquired has become &quot;West Campus&quot;, and increased the campus size by 25 percent. A $15 million shopping center and supermarket complex opened in Fall 2008 across from the Germantown Hospital. In 2015, Hanycz led consolidation and prioritization efforts, ultimately firing a couple dozen prominent staff members and administrators. The university even cut six undergraduate majors, which were mostly in the foreign language department. However, just a year after her arrival, the school stated that it would decrease tuition by 29 percent. The reasoning for the significant tuition cut was to make La Salle more attractive and accessible for students from more diverse socioeconomic backgrounds.

The Shoppes at La Salle was formerly home to the university&#x27;s softball field and other recreational areas. The renovated Holroyd Science Center was completed in Fall 2009 and a new business school opened in West Campus in January 2016.

In the summer of 2016, McShain Hall in the middle of campus was torn down and replaced with more green space. The new quad was named after its donor, the Hansen family.

A satellite campus and Conference Center in Newtown, Bucks County, Pennsylvania, the La Salle University Bucks County Center, offers graduate courses in various disciplines, undergraduate courses in nursing, and continuing education courses. The Conference Center comprises fifteen instructional rooms with seating capacities ranging from 20 to 40, along with four computer laboratories with 100 workstations. La Salle offers M.B.A. and Clinical-Counseling Psychology Master of Arts classes at the Plymouth Meeting Metroplex Corporate Center in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.

In the fall of 2016, La Salle changed its motto from &quot;Never Stop Exploring&quot; to &quot;Explorers are Never Lost&quot;. The change reflected a new brand campaign, coinciding with the announcement that La Salle would decrease tuition by more than 29 percent. In the Spring of 2024 La Salle announced it was releasing a new motto &quot;Be Known For More&quot;.
In October 2015, La Salle inaugurated its first lay person and first woman president, Colleen Hanycz, former president of Brescia University College.

==Governance==

The university is led by its board of trustees headed by a president and chair. The president serves one or more 5–year terms. , there have been 29 Presidents. Students are represented through a democratically elected student government. The La Salle Students&#x27; Government Association sits on numerous committees led by staff and administrators, including some board meetings. La Salle&#x27;s student government is a founding member of the American Student Government Association. The president&#x27;s office, formerly located in the historic Peale House, is now in College Hall, the former business school building.

==Academics==
Within La Salle is the College of Professional and Continuing Studies and its three Schools: Arts &amp; Sciences, Business Administration, and Nursing &amp; Health Sciences. Communication, Nursing, and Education are the largest majors at La Salle. Courses in the programs may be offered in traditional, online, or hybrid formats.

===Tuition and financial aid===
In the Fall 2017 semester, La Salle University decreased its tuition by 29%, citing affordability for all students and a &quot;renaissance&quot; at the school. Even prior to the tuition reduction, La Salle was recognized for its value.

===Admissions===
Undergraduate fall enrollment declined from more than 4,500 in 2012 to 3,900 in 2018.

The average GPA for an admitted student at La Salle is a 3.35 on a 4.0 scale. Its acceptance rate is labeled as &quot;moderately difficult&quot; and admits about 75 percent of students who apply. La Salle requires SAT or ACT scores and an essay for admission. La Salle also uses the common application for prospective students in the United States.

According to The New York Times, the median family income of a student from La Salle is about $91,000 per year. 40 percent of La Salle students come from families in the top 20 percent of income. 37.1 percent come from families in the bottom 60 percent of income (&lt;$65,000 per year). Less than 1 percent come from families in the top 1 percent of income ($650k+).

===Academic rankings===


==Athletics==
La Salle University&#x27;s 20 varsity sports teams, known as the Explorers, compete in the NCAA&#x27;s Division I. La Salle is a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) and the historic Philadelphia Big 5, an informal association of Philadelphia sports programs. As a member of the Big 5, the Explorers historically played against Temple University, the University of Pennsylvania, Villanova University and Saint Joseph&#x27;s University at least once a year at the Palestra. Starting in 2023–24, with the retooling of the Big 5 into the Big 5 Classic and the formal addition of Drexel University to the rivalry, La Salle is only guaranteed games with Drexel and Temple, plus one game against one of the other three teams. (The Explorers&#x27; two A-10 games against Saint Joseph&#x27;s are not part of the Classic.) They have won eleven titles. La Salle has sent 16 athletes to the Olympic a total of 22 times. La Salle athletes have won a total of six Olympic medals (four gold, and two bronze) and have appeared in eleven Olympic Games.

La Salle&#x27;s teams have won two national championships: The 1954 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament and the 1980 Division II AIAW Field Hockey Championship. The school also won the 1952 National Invitation Tournament. La Salle&#x27;s major historic rival has been the Hawks of Saint Joseph&#x27;s University, especially in men&#x27;s basketball. Not only are both universities situated in Philadelphia, but they are also both Catholic, private institutions.

The name &quot;Explorer&quot; derives from a 1931 mistake made by a sportswriter. The writer thought the university was named after the French explorer Sieur de La Salle, when in fact it is named after St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle and was officially chosen in a student contest during the spring of 1932.

In 2016, La Salle University changed its tagline from &quot;Never Stop Exploring&quot; to &quot;Explorers are Never Lost&quot;.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

The program has been rated the 53rd &quot;Greatest College Basketball Program of All-Time&quot; by Street &amp; Smith&#x27;s magazine and 71st by the ESPN College Basketball Encyclopedia.

La Salle has won one National Championship, one National Invitation Tournament Championship, and advanced to two Final Fours. The Explorers have also made 12 NCAA Tournament appearances, won eight Philadelphia Big 5 city championships, and four Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Championships. The program is one of only two schools (with Houston) to have two players in the top 25 in all-time NCAA scoring - Lionel Simmons and Michael Brooks. It&#x27;s also had three National Players of the Year - only Duke University and Ohio State have had more.

La Salle&#x27;s last successful run in the NCAA Tournament a surprising run in 2013 when La Salle went to the Sweet Sixteen as an underdog. The Explorers pulled off surprise upsets, beating ranked Kansas State and Ole Miss.

La Salle also has an extensive history of players who played professional basketball, including Michael Brooks, (1980 College Player of the Year), Joe Bryant (father of Kobe Bryant), Rasual Butler (formerly with the Washington Wizards), Larry Cannon, Ken Durrett, Tom Gola, (NBA Hall of Fame inductee and 1955 College Player of the Year), and Tim Legler (current basketball analyst for ESPN and 4th all-time in NBA three-point shooting percentage).

The Explorers played in Tom Gola Arena as their main home stadium from 1998 to 2024. Following the 2023-24 season, Tom Gola Arena was renovated and is now known as John Glaser Arena. The new arena is named after John E. Glaser, an alumni and doner who provided funds for the arena renovation. The Explorers play at the Wells Fargo Center for Philadelphia Big 5 tournament games.

=== Women&#x27;s basketball ===
==Campus==
La Salle moved to its fourth and present location in 1931. The campus is located in part on Belfield, the estate of Charles Willson Peale, the Revolutionary War patriot and painter famous for his portraits of the founding fathers, most notably, George Washington. The first to occupy the land of the Belfield after the passing of the famously known painter, Charles Wilson Peale, was William Logan Fisher. Fisher was born to the family of Thomas Fisher and Sarah Logan; Sarah had inherited the northeastern portion of Stenton. Fisher&#x27;s roots lay deeply in La Salle&#x27;s history as he owned the land that is now South Campus. After living there, Fisher gave this land to his daughter Sarah Logan Fisher and her husband William Wister. The home belonged to the Wisters until 1984 when La Salle University purchased the land. What once was the home of a famous artist, and later affluent family&quot;,&quot; is the current office of the University president.

La Salle&#x27;s campus is located in the Logan, Philadelphia-Ogontz/Belfield neighborhood of Philadelphia. In May 2007, La Salle created their West Campus after buying a portion of Germantown Hospital in the Germantown neighborhood of the city. La Salle&#x27;s campus is divided into 3 parts: North, South, and West campus. Both the North and South parts of campus are located in the Logan-Belfield area of Philadelphia, and the western portion of campus (west of Wister Street) is located in the Germantown, Philadelphia neighborhood of the city.

===La Salle University Art Museum===

La Salle University Art Museum is located in the basement of Hayman Hall and houses a collection of European and American art from the Renaissance to the present. The museum also owns a number of special collections including Japanese prints. The art museum is also home to the &quot;Walking Madonna&quot;, one of four by the British artist Dame Elisabeth Frink. Frink created the sculpture in 1981, the other &quot;Walking Madonna&quot; sculptures remain in England, with one in Salisbury and the other in Frink&#x27;s garden at her home. In early 2018, the university announced plans to sell forty-six artworks from the La Salle University Art Museum to &quot;help fund teaching and learning initiatives in its new strategic plan&quot;. Selling art to fund the university is controversial in the art community and the plan was criticized by artists and museum groups.
=== Student housing ===
In 2011, St. Basil&#x27;s Court was considered by DormSplash.com as the best dorm in the country. St. Basil&#x27;s Court is mostly home to honors students, athletes, and upperclassmen.

Living styles vary by location. In North Residence Halls and St. Neumann, men and women live in the same building but on different floors. In St. Basil&#x27;s, men and women live on the same floors but on different sides of the hall. In the St. Miguel Townhouses and Apartments, men and women live with the same gender in their own living space with a kitchen and bathrooms. In 2016, students voted to have gender-neutral housing in the St. Miguel Townhouses, which would make La Salle the only Catholic university in the country to facilitate co-ed living. This issue caused controversy in Catholic circles across the United States since it is traditional for Catholic school residence halls to be completely separated by gender. La Salle also has individual unit gender-neutral bathrooms in some of their residence halls.

==Student life==

Students at La Salle are offered many opportunities to participate at different degrees and in many different ways. There are several organizations and a student programming center whose mission is primarily to plan activities (games, movie nights, bus trips, etc.) for the students of La Salle University. The Communication Department operates La Salle 56, a cable TV educational-access television station available to 300,000 subscribers. The university also has a student-run radio station, WEXP and a student-run weekly newspaper, &quot;The Collegian&quot;, along with over 100 other intramurals, clubs, and NCAA Division I sports offered. La Salle University offers a number of student services, including non-remedial tutoring, a women&#x27;s center, career advising and placement services, health services, and health insurance. La Salle also offers campus safety and security services like 24-hour foot and vehicle patrols, late night transport/escort service, 24-hour emergency telephones, lighted pathways/sidewalks, controlled dormitory access (key, security card, etc.). Alcohol is permitted for students of legal age, making La Salle one of the few Catholic wet campuses. La Salle is also an LGBTQ-friendly Catholic university.

===Demographics===
About 55 percent of the students live in college-owned, -operated or -affiliated housing and 45 percent of students live off campus near the university or commute from home. The gender distribution is about 37 percent male students and 63 percent female students. Of La Salle students, about 35 percent have cars on campus. It has a total undergraduate enrollment of about 3,947, its setting is urban, and the campus size is 133 acres.

La Salle TV is a student run, public, educational, and government access (PEG) cable television station that offers an Educational-access television channel run by La Salle and carried within Philadelphia&#x27;s city limits on the Comcast cable system. The station reaches over 300,000 homes and serves La Salle students and its neighbors with educational and entertaining programs. The station also serves as a hands-on teaching facility for students interested in the communication field. In 2009, La Salle 56 officially changed their name to La Salle TV due to a recent agreement with Verizon to carry the student television station. La Salle University gained the cable channel in 1991 as part of the franchise agreements between cable providers and the city of Philadelphia. The student television station is a main component of the Communication Department, which uses the department&#x27;s technical facility and allows use students majoring in communication. Notable station alumni include Meredith Marakovits.

La Salle TV features a variety of student-produced programs, including collegiate sports, entertainment, and social issues. Original student films are broadcast in addition to interviews with local and national authors, actors, musicians, athletes, and television personalities. During the academic year when the majority of new programming is produced, each show is assigned a specific timeslot. Two-hour station masters containing non-dated material fill the remaining time. The hours between 8:00pm and 12:00am are used mainly for new La Salle-produced programs.

====&quot;The Collegian&quot;====
&quot;The Collegian&quot; published its first issue on March 16, 1931. It is the only on-campus newspaper for La Salle. It is published weekly every Thursday throughout the school year. The newspaper is written, edited, and produced by La Salle students underneath a faculty adviser. The newspaper is &quot;not&quot; independent, meaning that it has restrictions placed by the University on what it can publish. Restrictions are placed by the Division of Student Affairs and sometimes the President&#x27;s Office.

====WEXP====
WEXP is a college radio station with a freeform radio format. It previously broadcast on 1600 and 530 AM in the Philadelphia-area before becoming an Internet radio-only station.

WEXP opened its studio in 1972. Initially, the radio station could only be heard inside the Student Union building. However, with the advent of computers in every dorm, where AM radios became scarcer to find, the station chose to embark on an Internet-only focus, setting up a partnership with live365 beginning in the fourth quarter of 2002. The shift in focus re-energized the station by recruiting more members and boosting listenership both on campus and across the country.

===Greek life===

One of the aspects of La Salle&#x27;s social scene are its fraternities and sororities. In total, La Salle has fourteen Greek life organizations: Ten traditional fraternities and sororities, two Divine Nine (historically black) organizations, and two co-educational fraternities.

====Fraternities====
La Salle has six chartered fraternities, five of which are nationally recognized. Sigma Phi Lambda—not to be confused with Sigma Phi Lambda, the nationally recognized sorority founded in Austin, Texas—is the only unrecognized national fraternity on La Salle&#x27;s campus. Sigma Phi Lambda, however, was La Salle University&#x27;s first and oldest fraternity.

==== Sororities ====

La Salle&#x27;s Greek life community consists of six sororities. Sororities were incorporated at La Salle after 1970, once the school started admitting women. Five La Salle sororities are nationally recognized: Alpha Sigma Tau, Gamma Phi Beta, Delta Phi Epsilon, Phi Mu, and Zeta Phi Beta. Alpha Theta Alpha&#x27;s only charter is at La Salle University, where the sorority originally began. Alpha Theta Alpha was La Salle University&#x27;s first sorority.

====Co-educational fraternities====

In addition, La Salle also offers two co-educational fraternities: a business fraternity, Delta Sigma Pi, and a community service fraternity, Epsilon Sigma Alpha.

===University ministry and service===
La Salle&#x27;s religiously-affiliated University Ministry and Service (UMAS) program offers student ministry and community service opportunities for students. Regardless of religious affiliation, La Salle students can participate in more than a dozen weekly service and volunteer projects in Philadelphia including working at food banks, homeless shelters, the Special Olympics, and more. La Salle holds mass once a day, every week. Their Sunday liturgy has high student involvement through student ministers.

Students can also participate in service trips, known as Lasallian Immersion and Volunteer Experiences (LIVE). Service trips occur domestically and internationally. Domestic service trips include going to Habitat for Humanity programs, working in Harlan, Kentucky in Appalachia, and even going to local locations like Camden, New Jersey. International service trip volunteers go to Kenya, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Honduras, and more. Each student&#x27;s trip is subsidized by the school and by their own fundraising initiatives.

==Notable alumni==
La Salle alumni have earned numerous accolades, scholarships, and titles including an Emmy award, a Pulitzer Prize, six Olympic gold medals, a Marshall scholarship, about one-hundred Fulbright scholarships, and more. La Salle has three alumni currently serving in the United States House of Representatives along with about a dozen representatives in the Pennsylvania General Assembly and one on the Philadelphia City Council.

<doc id="632135" wikidata="Q2835184" url="?curid=632135" title="Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine">
<text>Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s Mystery Magazine (AHMM) is a bi-monthly digest size fiction magazine specializing in crime and detective fiction. &quot;AHMM&quot; is named for Alfred Hitchcock, the famed director of suspense films and television.

==History==
&quot;AHMM&quot; was founded in 1956 by HSD Publications, which licensed the use of the director&#x27;s name. Though there was no formal connection with the television show, stories published in the magazine were sometimes adapted by the producers of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, and later, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;. A few writers, such as Henry Slesar, wrote for both. Other contributors during the magazine’s early years included Evan Hunter (under the pen name Ed McBain), Ed Lacy, Bill Pronzini, Jim Thompson, Donald E. Westlake and Charles Willeford (who briefly worked for the magazine). Pat Hitchcock, Alfred&#x27;s daughter, also briefly worked for the magazine.

In 1975, &quot;AHMM&quot; was acquired by Davis Publications, which later sold the magazine along with its sister publication, &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; to Dell Magazines in 1992.

Since 2002, it has been edited by Linda Landrigan. 

After &quot;EQMM&quot;, &quot;AHMM&quot; is the second-longest-running mystery fiction magazine. In 2006, the magazine celebrated its 50th anniversary with the publication of the anthology &quot;Alfred Hitchcock’s Mystery Magazine Presents Fifty Years of Crime and Suspense&quot;.

In 2007, &quot;AHMM&quot; joined with The Wolfe Pack, a society founded in 1978 to celebrate the Nero Wolfe stories of Rex Stout, to sponsor the Black Orchid Novella Contest for stories in the &quot;classic detective” style of Stout’s Nero Wolfe.

<doc id="632141" wikidata="Q5595210" url="?curid=632141" title="Grand Upright Music, Ltd. v. Warner Bros. Records Inc.">
<text>Grand Upright Music, Ltd v. Warner Bros. Records Inc., 780 F. Supp. 182 (S.D.N.Y. 1991), was a copyright case heard by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Songwriter Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan sued rapper Biz Markie after Markie sampled O&#x27;Sullivan&#x27;s song &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot;. The court ruled that sampling without permission constitutes copyright infringement. The judgment changed the hip hop music industry, requiring that any future music sampling be approved by the original copyright owners.

==Case==
Rapper Biz Markie had sampled a portion of the song &quot;Alone Again (Naturally)&quot; by singer-songwriter Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan in the track &quot;Alone Again&quot; from Markie&#x27;s third album, &quot;I Need a Haircut&quot;. Markie and his production and recording companies were listed as co-defendants with Warner Bros. in the subsequent lawsuit.

Judge Kevin Thomas Duffy granted an injunction against the defendant, Warner Bros. Records, despite Warner Bros.&#x27; claim that Grand Upright did not own a valid copyright in the sampled song. Warner Bros. denied that Grand Upright owned the copyright to the song, though Grand Upright produced documentation that O&#x27;Sullivan had transferred title to them, and O&#x27;Sullivan himself testified to that regard. It also appears that the defendants unsuccessfully urged the court to take note of how common unapproved sampling was in the industry, because the court noted that &quot;the defendants...would have this court believe that stealing is rampant in the music business and, for that reason, their conduct here should be excused.&quot;

The decision received some criticism for stating that &quot;the most persuasive evidence that the copyrights are valid and owned by the plaintiff&quot; was that Warner Bros. had previously attempted to obtain permission to use the song. However, this would not legally establish that Grand Upright was in fact the owner, but only that Warner Bros. believed that the song was copyrighted by &quot;someone&quot;, which would make their infringement knowing and willful. As Grand Upright had provided evidence that specifically established the copyright was theirs, the ruling did not hinge on this point, however.

The court wrote that &quot;it is clear that the defendants knew that they were violating the plaintiff&#x27;s rights as well as the rights of others. Their only aim was to sell thousands upon thousands of records. This callous disregard for the law and for the rights of others requires not only the preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiff but also sterner measures.&quot; The judge referred the matter to a United States Attorney for criminal prosecution, though no criminal charges were filed.

Judge Duffy has been accused of bias in admonishing the defense and referring the defense for criminal prosecution. Such criticism points out that Duffy&#x27;s written opinion begins with one of the biblical ten commandments, &quot;Thou shalt not steal.&quot; According to The Copyright Infringement Project of UCLA Law and Columbia Law School, Judge Duffy&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Grand Upright v. Warner&quot; demonstrates &quot;an iffy understanding on the part of this judge of the facts and issues before him in this case.&quot;

==Impact on music==
The court case had a major effect on hip hop music. Sample clearance fees prohibited the use of more than one or two samples for most recordings, with some mechanical rights holders demanding up to 100% of royalties. As each sample had to be cleared to avoid legal action, records such as those produced by the Bomb Squad for Public Enemy, which use dozens of samples, became prohibitively expensive to produce. According to &quot;Pitchfork,&quot; &quot;Overnight it became forbiddingly difficult and expensive to incorporate even a handful of samples into a new beat ... Producers scaled back their creations, often augmenting one choice groove with a bevy of instrumental embellishments.&quot;

As a result, interpolation (replaying the requested sample using new instrumentalists, using the newly recorded version and simply paying the songwriters—and not the artist or the label—for use of the composition) became prevalent in the industry, especially in the work of Dr. Dre. As early as 1989, Dr. Dre&#x27;s production was styled around fewer samples per track, studio instrumentation, and sampling artists such as Parliament-Funkadelic who were amenable to having their music sampled.

&quot;Alone Again&quot; is not available on current releases of Markie&#x27;s &quot;Haircut&quot; album. His next album was entitled &quot;All Samples Cleared!&quot;
