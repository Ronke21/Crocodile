<text>The Robinson Helicopter Company, based at Zamperini Field in Torrance, California, is an American helicopter manufacturer. , Robinson produces three models: the two-seat R22, the four-seat R44, both of which use Lycoming piston engines, and the five-seat R66, which use Rolls-Royce turbine engines.

==History==

The company was founded in 1973 by Frank Robinson, a former employee of Bell Helicopter and Hughes Helicopters. Since delivering its first helicopter in 1979, Robinson Helicopter has produced over 12,000 aircraft. Robinson helicopter celebrated 50 years in business in June 2023.

Plans for production of the Robinson R66 were announced in March 2007. It is a five-seat helicopter of similar configuration to the R44, but with the addition of a luggage compartment, wider cabin by , and powered by a Rolls-Royce RR300 gas turbine engine.

In 2013, Robinson was the global market leader, selling 523 light helicopters, a 1% increase from 2012. Production in 2014 dropped to 329 aircraft. In 2015, Robinson produces one R22, four or five R44s, and one or two R66s per week, and has contracted with Rolls-Royce to supply 100 RR300 turbines per year for 10 years for the R66. The factory can produce up to 1,000 helicopters per year.

In 2024, Robinson bought Ascent Aerosystems, a maker of drones for the government &amp; military.

== Products ==

* Robinson R22
* Robinson R44
* Robinson R66
The R66 is the only turboshaft powered helicopter in Robinson&#x27;s lineup.
Robinson also produces the Robinson Helipad, a modular helipad designed for light helicopters. 

== Mast-bumping controversy ==
Mast bumping is a dangerous condition helicopters can encounter when load on the helicopter&#x27;s rotor assembly is temporarily reduced during flight (for example, during a low-&quot;g&quot; maneuver or turbulent weather). The reduction of load triggers excessive flapping in the helicopter&#x27;s rotor blades, which can cause the entire rotor assembly to shear off the aircraft.

Robinson helicopters use a patented design for their main rotor, with a triple-hinged rotor assembly &quot;teetering&quot; atop an extended mast. Several Robinson helicopters have been destroyed in incidents where mast bumping was determined to have occurred. A May 2018 article in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported Robinson helicopters seemed to have increased susceptibility to mast-bumping incidents.

In 2016, the New Zealand Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) released a report summarizing 14 mast-bumping accidents or incidents involving Robinson helicopters in New Zealand, in which 18 people died. The TAIC report noted that &quot;Helicopters with semirigid, two-bladed main rotor systems, as used on Robinson helicopters, are particularly susceptible to mast bumping in &quot;low-G&quot; conditions&quot;.

In 2018, a U.S. lawsuit accused the Robinson Helicopter Company of defective manufacturing after a mast-bumping event caused the in-flight breakup of an R66 helicopter.

<text>The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league composed of 32 teams, founded in 1917. Each team is entitled to one head coach who handles the directing of games and team practices, while providing direction and strategy for their players and deciding which players will play in games and the lines they will play on. In some cases, a coach will only serve on an interim basis, while some teams may have more than one coach who serve as co-coaches. Outside the team management, the coach also addresses the media.

<doc id="630391" wikidata="Q115462" url="?curid=630391" title="Fritz Zwicky">
<text>Fritz Zwicky (; ; February 14, 1898 – February 8, 1974) was a Swiss astronomer. He worked most of his life at the California Institute of Technology in the United States of America, where he made many important contributions in theoretical and observational astronomy. In 1933, Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to postulate the existence of unseen dark matter, describing it as &quot;&quot;.

== Biography ==

Fritz Zwicky was born in Varna, Bulgaria, to a Swiss father (citizenship in Mollis, Glarus) and Czech mother. His father, Fridolin (b. 1868), was a prominent industrialist in the Bulgarian city and also served as Norwegian consul in Varna (1908–1933). Fridolin Zwicky designed and built his family&#x27;s Zwicky House in Varna. Fritz&#x27;s mother, Franziska Vrček (b. 1871), was an ethnic Czech of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Fritz was the oldest of three children: he had a younger brother named Rudolf and a sister, Leonie. Fritz&#x27;s mother died in Varna in 1927. His father lived and worked in Bulgaria until 1945, and returned to Switzerland after World War II. Fritz&#x27;s sister Leonie married a Bulgarian from Varna and spent her entire life in the city.

In 1904, at the age of six, Fritz was sent to his paternal grandparents to Glarus, Switzerland, to study commerce. His interests shifted to math and physics. He received an advanced education in mathematics and experimental physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (today known as ETH Zurich) in Zürich. He finished his studies there in 1922 with a Dr. sc. nat. degree (PhD equivalent) with a thesis entitled &quot;Zur Theorie der heteropolaren Kristalle&quot; (&quot;On the theory of heteropolar crystals&quot;). 

In 1925, Zwicky emigrated to the United States to work with Robert Millikan at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) after receiving the Rockefeller Foundation fellowship. He had an office down the hall from Robert Oppenheimer.

Zwicky developed numerous cosmological theories that have had a profound influence on the understanding of our universe in the early 21st century. He coined the term &quot;supernova&quot; while fostering the concept of neutron stars. Five years passed before Oppenheimer published his landmark paper announcing &quot;neutron stars&quot;. 

Zwicky was appointed Professor of Astronomy at Caltech in 1942. He also worked as a research director/consultant for Aerojet Engineering Corporation (1943–1961), and as a staff member of Mount Wilson Observatory and Palomar Observatory for most of his career. He developed some of the earliest jet engines and holds more than 50 patents, many in jet propulsion. He invented the Underwater Jet. An example of his WWII rocket propulsion work would be a patent on a nitromethane engine filed by a collective of Zwicky and three other Aerojet employees in March 1944, and he also published an article on chemical kinetics in rocket engines and motors in 1950.

==Personal life==
On 25 March 1932, Fritz Zwicky married Dorothy Vernon Gates (1904–1991), a member of a prominent local family and a daughter of California State Senator Egbert James Gates. Her money was instrumental in the funding of the Palomar Observatory during the Great Depression. Nicholas Roosevelt, cousin of President Theodore Roosevelt, was his brother-in-law by marriage to Tirzah Gates. Zwicky and Dorothy divorced amicably in 1941. 

On 18 October 1947 Zwicky married in Switzerland to Anna Margaritha Zürcher (1929-2012). They had three daughters together, Margrit, Franziska, and Barbarina. The Zwicky Museum at the Landesbibliothek, Glarus, houses many of his papers and scientific works. Zwicky died in Pasadena, California on February 8, 1974, and was buried in Mollis, Switzerland.

Zwicky was critical of religion and considered it unacceptable to attribute natural phenomena to God.

He is remembered as both a genius and a . One of his favorite insults was to refer to people whom he did not like as &quot;spherical bastards&quot;, because, as he explained, they were bastards no matter which way one looked at them.

==Legacy==
The Fritz Zwicky Stiftung (Foundation) was established in Switzerland to carry on his ideas relating to &quot;Morphological analysis&quot;. The foundation published a biography of Zwicky in English: Alfred Stöckli &amp; Roland Müller: &quot;Fritz Zwicky – An Extraordinary Astrophysicist&quot;. Cambridge: Cambridge Scientific Publishers, 2011. A review of the book is available from &quot;Acta Morphologica Generalis&quot; .

== Scientific work ==
Fritz Zwicky was a prolific scientist and made important contributions in many areas of astronomy.

=== Ionic crystals and electrolytes===
His first scientific contributions pertained to ionic crystals and electrolytes.

=== Supernovae and neutron stars ===
Together with colleague Walter Baade, Zwicky pioneered and promoted the use of the first Schmidt telescopes used in a mountain-top observatory in 1935. In 1934 he and Baade coined the term &quot;supernova&quot; and hypothesized that supernovae were the transition of normal stars into neutron stars, as well as the origin of cosmic rays. This was an opinion which contributed to determining the size and age of the universe subsequently.

In support of this hypothesis, Zwicky started looking for supernovae, and found a total of 120 by himself (and one more, SN 1963J, in concert with Paul Wild) over 52 years (SN 1921B through SN 1973K), a record which stood until 2009 when passed by Tom Boles. Zwicky did his laborious work, comparing photographic plates with the human eye, which is far more challenging and difficult than Boles accomplished using modern technology for his record.

=== Gravitational lenses ===
In 1937, Zwicky posited that galaxies could act as gravitational lenses by the previously discovered Einstein effect. It was not until 1979 that this effect was confirmed by observation of the so-called &quot;Twin Quasar&quot; Q0957+561.

=== Dark matter ===
While examining the Coma galaxy cluster in 1933, Zwicky was the first to use the virial theorem to discover the existence of a gravitational anomaly, which he termed &quot;dunkle Materie&quot; &#x27;dark matter&#x27;. The gravitational anomaly surfaced due to the excessive rotational velocity of luminous matter compared to the calculated gravitational attraction within the cluster. He calculated the gravitational mass of the galaxies within the cluster from the observed rotational velocities and obtained a value at least 400 times greater than expected from their luminosity. The same calculation today shows a smaller factor, based on greater values for the mass of luminous material.

=== Tired light ===
When Edwin Hubble discovered a somewhat linear relationship between the distance to a galaxy and its redshift expressed as a velocity, Zwicky immediately pointed out that the correlation between the calculated distances of galaxies and their redshifts had a discrepancy too large to fit in the distance&#x27;s error margins. He proposed that the reddening effect was not due to motions of the galaxy, but to an unknown phenomenon that caused photons to lose energy as they traveled through space. He considered the most likely candidate process to be a drag effect in which photons transfer momentum to surrounding masses through gravitational interactions; and proposed that an attempt be made to put this effect on a sound theoretical footing with general relativity. He also considered and rejected explanations involving interactions with free electrons, or the expansion of space.

Zwicky was skeptical of the expansion of space in 1929, because the rates measured at that time seemed too large. It was not until 1956 that Walter Baade corrected the distance scale based on Cepheid variable stars, and ushered in the first accurate measures of the expansion rate. Cosmological redshift is now conventionally understood to be a consequence of the expansion of space; a feature of Big Bang cosmology.

=== Morphological analysis ===
Zwicky developed a generalised form of morphological analysis, which is a method for systematically structuring and investigating the total set of relationships contained in multi-dimensional, usually non-quantifiable, problem complexes. He wrote books on the subject in 1957 and 1969, and claimed that he made many of his discoveries using this method.

=== &quot;Catalog of Galaxies and Clusters&quot; ===

Zwicky devoted considerable time to the search for galaxies and the production of catalogs. From 1961 to 1968 he and his colleagues published a comprehensive six volume &quot;Catalogue of galaxies and of clusters of galaxies&quot;. They were all published in Pasadena, by the California Institute of Technology.

Galaxies in the original catalog are called &quot;Zwicky galaxies&quot;, and the catalog is still maintained and updated today. Zwicky with his wife Margaritha also produced an important catalog of compact galaxies, sometimes called simply &quot;The Red Book&quot;.

=== Original thinker ===
Zwicky was an original thinker, and his contemporaries frequently had no way of knowing which of his ideas would work out and which would not. In a retrospective look at Zwicky&#x27;s life and work, Stephen Maurer said:
When researchers talk about neutron stars, dark matter, and gravitational lenses, they all start the same way: &quot;Zwicky noticed this problem in the 1930s. Back then, nobody listened...&quot;

He is celebrated for the discovery of neutron stars. He also proposed a concept he called &quot;nuclear goblins&quot;, which he described as &quot;a body of nuclear density ... only stable under sufficient external pressure within a massive and dense star&quot;. He considered that these goblins could move within a star, and explode violently as they reach less dense regions towards the star&#x27;s surface, and serve to explain eruptive phenomena, such as flare stars. This idea has never caught on.

An anecdote often told of Zwicky concerns an informal experiment to see if he could reduce problems with turbulence hindering an observation session one night at Mount Wilson observatory. He told his assistant to fire a gun out through the telescope slit, in the hope it would help smooth out the turbulence. No effect was noticed, but the event shows the kind of lateral thinking for which Zwicky was famous.

In a talk to a Caltech PhD student Frank Malina, who experienced some difficulties working on a dissertation regarding characteristics of oxygen-gasoline rocket engine, Fritz Zwicky claimed the engineer &quot;must realize that a rocket could not operate in space as it required the atmosphere to push against to provide thrust&quot;. Zwicky later admitted that he had been mistaken.

He was also very proud of his work in producing the first artificial meteors. He placed explosive charges in the nose cone of a V2 rocket, to be detonated at high altitude and fire high velocity pellets of metal through the atmosphere. The first attempts appeared to be failures, and Zwicky sought to try again with the Aerobee rocket. His requests were denied, until the Soviet Union launched Sputnik 1. Twelve days later, on October 16, 1957, Zwicky launched his experiment on the Aerobee, and successfully fired pellets visible from the Mount Palomar observatory. It is thought that one of these pellets may have escaped the gravitational pull of the Earth and become the first object launched into a solar orbit.

Zwicky also considered the possibility of rearranging the universe to our own liking. In a lecture in 1948 he spoke of changing planets, or relocating them within the Solar System. In the 1960s he even considered how the whole Solar System might be moved like a giant spaceship to travel to other stars. He considered this might be achieved by firing pellets into the Sun to produce asymmetrical fusion explosions, and by this means he thought that the star Alpha Centauri might be reached within 2500 years.

== Humanitarian ==
Zwicky was a generous humanitarian with a great concern for wider society. These two sides of his nature came together in the aftermath of the Second World War, when Zwicky worked hard to collect tons of books on astronomy and other topics, and shipped them to war-ravaged scientific libraries in Europe and Asia.

He also had a longstanding involvement with the charitable Pestalozzi Foundation of America, supporting orphanages. Zwicky received their gold medal in 1955, in recognition of his services.

Zwicky loved the mountains, and was an accomplished alpine climber.

He was critical of political posturing by all sides in the Middle East, and of the use of nuclear weapons in World War II. He considered that hope for the world lay with free people of good will who work together as needed, without institutions or permanent organizations.

== Media persona==
Zwicky&#x27;s ideas captured the imagination of the public. He was widely quoted by reporters.

In January 1934, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; published the cartoon &quot;Be Scientific with Ol&#x27; Doc Dabble&quot;, which had a caption describing Zwicky&#x27;s research and which implicitly caricatured him as &quot;Doc Dabble&quot;.

Some scenes of the 13th episode of depicts an actor playing Fritz Zwicky, at the same time that Neil DeGrasse Tyson talks about the importance of Zwicky&#x27;s studies on supernovae. 

== Honors ==
*In 1949, Truman awarded Zwicky the Medal of Freedom, for work on rocket propulsion during World War II. In 1968, Zwicky was made professor emeritus at California Institute of Technology.
*In 1972, Zwicky was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, their most prestigious award, for &quot;distinguished contributions to astronomy and cosmology&quot;. This award noted in particular his work on neutron stars, dark matter, and cataloging of galaxies.
*The asteroid 1803 Zwicky and the lunar crater Zwicky are both named in his honor.
*The Zwicky Transient Facility is named in his honor.

The man was Fritz Zwicky... The instrument was a little eighteen-inch telescope that he installed near the summit of Mount Palomar in California in 1935... Zwicky&#x27;s small, cheap telescope was the second one built with a revolutionary design by Bernhard Schmidt... in Germany... The Schmidt telescope had an enormous advantage over other telescopes at that time: it focused light accurately over a wide field of view...&quot;

<text>The Beat Generation is a 1959 American crime film noir from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer starring Steve Cochran and Mamie Van Doren, with Ray Danton, Fay Spain, Maggie Hayes, Jackie Coogan, Louis Armstrong, James Mitchum, Vampira, and Ray Anthony. It is a sensationalistic interpretation of the beatnik counterculture of the &quot;Beat Generation&quot; (and is sometimes considered one of the last films noir to be produced.) The movie was also shown under the title &quot;This Rebel Age&quot;. The movie is about a &quot;beatnik&quot; who is a serial rapist, who is pursued by a police detective. The director was Charles F. Haas. Richard Matheson and Lewis Meltzer are credited with the screenplay.

==Plot==
In the opening scene, a &quot;beatnik&quot; named Stan Hess (Ray Danton) sits at a table in a coffee house with a woman who begs him for his affection. He scorns her, then encounters his father at another table, who announces his engagement to a younger woman who had also pursued Stan. He insults his stepmother-to-be and departs. Hess is established as a woman-hating habitué of a stereotyped and sensationalized beatnik scene.

Soon after, we learn that Hess is a serial rapist at large in Los Angeles. His modus operandi is to gain entry to the home of a married woman whose husband is away by pretending to be there to repay money loaned by the husband. Once inside, he feigns a headache, pulls out a tin of aspirin, and asks the woman for water. While she is distracted by this errand, he sneaks up behind her, and then assaults and rapes her. He leaves the tin of aspirin behind as his calling card, leading the police to call him &quot;The Aspirin Kid.&quot; Leaving the scene of the first assault portrayed in the film, he is nearly hit by a car. The driver, who is a police detective named Culloran (Steve Cochran), gives him a lift, and the two engage in conversation. The rapist calls himself Arthur Garret, and as the two talk, he learns that Culloran is married, and sees his address on an envelope on the car seat. After getting out of Culloran&#x27;s car, he writes down the name and address, and the word &quot;married&quot;, foreshadowing his later rape of Culloran&#x27;s wife.

Coincidentally, the case of &#x27;The Aspirin Kid&#x27; is assigned to Culloran and his partner, Baron (Jackie Coogan). Culloran is a twice married man whose first marriage has made him suspicious of women. They have a suspect, a beatnik called Art Jester (James Mitchum) who fits a description of &#x27;The Aspirin Kid&#x27; but his alibi checks out.

Hess/Garrett calls Culloran at the police station, and lures him to a rendezvous at a night club by promising to turn himself in. Instead of coming to the club, though, he goes to Culloran&#x27;s home and attacks his wife, Francee (Fay Spain), also telling her his name is Arthur Garret. Culloran becomes obsessed with catching the rapist on his own without telling his colleagues that his wife has been raped. Francee later finds out she is pregnant. The possibility that the child may have been fathered by the rapist sows discord between the Cullorans, and stokes Detective Culloran&#x27;s obsession with avenging the rape. The couple argue over their ambivalence about the child and Francee&#x27;s desire to have an abortion, leading Francee to turn to Baron&#x27;s wife first, and then Baron for advice.

Garrett persuades Jester to try to throw Culloran off the track by committing a similar attack on a woman named Georgia Altera (Mamie Van Doren) at a time when Garrett couldn&#x27;t possibly be involved. But the cops know that Garrett is their man. Jester and Altera fall for each other.

At a party near the beach, the deranged Culloran attempts to capture Garrett. After an elaborate scuba-diving chase sequences, Culloran captures and beats up Garrett coming close to killing him before Baron intervenes. Culloran comes to his senses and returns to Francee, who gives birth.

==Cast==
==Production==
It was known during production as &quot;The Beat and the Naked Generation&quot;.

Richard Matheson, who had written &quot;The Incredible Shrinking Man&quot; for Zugsmith, said &quot;The Beat Generation&quot; was based on a true story &quot;about a guy who would meet salesmen and talk to them on the road, learn all about their houses, where they were during the day, what they did; then he would go and attack the wives while the salesmen were still on the road. I wrote it as a police procedure film. It ended up . . . well, you know how. I remember a copy of the script, many drafts in, where Zugsmith had meticulously crossed off police everywhere and had written in fuzz. It turned into absolute nonsense.&quot;

==Box office==
According to MGM records the film earned $400,000 in the US and Canada and $350,000 elsewhere resulting in a loss of $113,000.

<doc id="630398" wikidata="Q525506" url="?curid=630398" title="Identity of indiscernibles">
<text>The identity of indiscernibles is an ontological principle that states that there cannot be separate objects or that have all their properties in common. That is, entities &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are identical if every predicate possessed by &quot;x&quot; is also possessed by &quot;y&quot; and vice versa. It states that no two distinct things (such as snowflakes) can be exactly alike, but this is intended as a metaphysical principle rather than one of natural science. A related principle is the indiscernibility of identicals, discussed below.

A form of the principle is attributed to the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. While some think that Leibniz&#x27;s version of the principle is meant to be only the indiscernibility of identicals, others have interpreted it as the conjunction of the identity of indiscernibles and the indiscernibility of identicals (the converse principle). Because of its association with Leibniz, the indiscernibility of identicals is sometimes known as Leibniz&#x27;s law. It is considered to be one of his great metaphysical principles, the other being the principle of noncontradiction and the principle of sufficient reason (famously used in his disputes with Newton and Clarke in the Leibniz–Clarke correspondence).

Some philosophers have decided, however, that it is important to exclude certain predicates (or purported predicates) from the principle in order to avoid either triviality or contradiction. An example (detailed below) is the predicate that denotes whether an object is equal to &quot;x&quot; (often considered a valid predicate). As a consequence, there are a few different versions of the principle in the philosophical literature, of varying logical strength—and some of them are termed &quot;the strong principle&quot; or &quot;the weak principle&quot; by particular authors, in order to distinguish between them.

The identity of indiscernibles has been used to motivate notions of noncontextuality within quantum mechanics.

Associated with this principle is also the question as to whether it is a logical principle, or merely an empirical principle.

==Identity and indiscernibility==
Both identity and indiscernibility are expressed by the word &quot;same&quot;. &quot;Identity&quot; is about &quot;numerical sameness&quot;, and is expressed by the equality sign (&quot;=&quot;). It is the relation each object bears only to itself. &quot;Indiscernibility&quot;, on the other hand, concerns &quot;qualitative sameness&quot;: two objects are indiscernible if they have all their properties in common. Formally, this can be expressed as &quot;formula_1&quot;. The two senses of &quot;sameness&quot; are linked by two principles: the principle of &quot;indiscernibility of identicals&quot; and the principle of &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot;. The principle of &quot;indiscernibility of identicals&quot; is uncontroversial and states that if two entities are identical with each other then they have the same properties. The principle of &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot;, on the other hand, is more controversial in making the converse claim that if two entities have the same properties then they must be identical. This entails that &quot;no two distinct things exactly resemble each other&quot;. Note that these are all second-order expressions. Neither of these principles can be expressed in first-order logic (are nonfirstorderizable). Formally, the two principles can be expressed in the following way:

*The indiscernibility of identicals: formula_2
*:For any formula_3 and formula_4, if formula_3 is identical to formula_4, then formula_3 and formula_4 have all the same properties.
*The identity of indiscernibles: formula_9
*:For any formula_3 and formula_4, if formula_3 and formula_4 have all the same properties, then formula_3 is identical to formula_4.

The &quot;indiscernibility of identicals&quot; is usually taken to be uncontroversially true, whereas the &quot;identity of indiscernibles&quot; is more controversial, having been famously disputed by Max Black.

The conjunction of these two principles is sometimes called &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s Law&quot;, although this name has sometimes been used for either of the two other principles, or for other principles. It may be stated as a biconditional:

*Biconditional &quot;Leibniz&#x27;s Law&quot;: formula_16
*:For any formula_3 and formula_4, it is true that formula_3 is identical to formula_4 if, and only if, formula_3 and formula_4 have all the same properties.
Some logicians have regarded this principle as essential to identity and equality: Alfred Tarski listed it among the logical axioms governing the notion of identity, and Rudolf Carnap &quot;defined&quot; the equals sign for identity (=) in terms of this biconditional.

In a universe of two distinct objects A and B, all predicates F are materially equivalent to one of the following properties:
* IsA, the property that holds of A but not of B;
* IsB, the property that holds of B but not of A;
* IsAorB, the property that holds of both A and B;
* IsNotAorB, the property that holds of neither A nor B.

If ∀F applies to all such predicates, then the second principle as formulated above reduces trivially and uncontroversially to a logical tautology. In that case, the objects are distinguished by IsA, IsB, and all predicates that are materially equivalent to either of these. This argument can combinatorially be extended to universes containing any number of distinct objects.

The equality relation expressed by the sign &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation in being reflexive (everything is equal to itself), symmetric (if &quot;x&quot; is equal to &quot;y&quot; then &quot;y&quot; is equal to &quot;x&quot;) and transitive (if &quot;x&quot; is equal to &quot;y&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is equal to &quot;z&quot; then &quot;x&quot; is equal to &quot;z&quot;). The &quot;indiscernibility of identicals&quot; and &quot;identity of indiscernables&quot; can jointly be used to define the equality relation. The &quot;symmetry&quot; and &quot;transitivity&quot; of equality follow from the first principle, whereas &quot;reflexivity&quot; follows from the second. Both principles can be combined into a single axiom by using a biconditional operator (&quot;formula_23&quot;) in place of material implication (&quot;formula_24&quot;).

== Indiscernibility and conceptions of properties ==
Indiscernibility is usually defined in terms of shared properties: two objects are indiscernible if they have all their properties in common. The plausibility and strength of the principle of identity of indiscernibles depend on the conception of properties used to define indiscernibility.

One important distinction in this regard is between &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot; properties. &quot;Impure properties&quot; are properties that, unlike &quot;pure properties&quot;, involve reference to a particular substance in their definition. So, for example, &quot;being a wife&quot; is a pure property while &quot;being the wife of Socrates&quot; is an impure property due to the reference to the particular &quot;Socrates&quot;. Sometimes, the terms &quot;qualitative&quot; and &quot;non-qualitative&quot; are used instead of &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot;. Discernibility is usually defined in terms of pure properties only. The reason for this is that taking impure properties into consideration would result in the principle being trivially true since any entity has the impure property of being identical to itself, which it does not share with any other entity.

Another important distinction concerns the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic properties. A property is &quot;extrinsic&quot; to an object if having this property depends on other objects (with or without reference to particular objects), otherwise it is &quot;intrinsic&quot;. For example, the property of &quot;being an aunt&quot; is extrinsic while the property of &quot;having a mass of 60 kg&quot; is intrinsic. If the identity of indiscernibles is defined only in terms of &quot;intrinsic pure&quot; properties, one cannot regard two books lying on a table as distinct when they are &quot;intrinsically identical&quot;. But if &quot;extrinsic&quot; and &quot;impure&quot; properties are also taken into consideration, the same books become distinct so long as they are discernible through the latter properties.

==Critique==
===Symmetric universe===
Max Black has argued against the identity of indiscernibles by counterexample. Notice that to show that the identity of indiscernibles is false, it is sufficient that one provide a model in which there are two distinct (numerically nonidentical) things that have all the same properties. He claimed that in a symmetric universe wherein only two symmetrical spheres exist, the two spheres are two distinct objects even though they have all their properties in common.

Black argues that even relational properties (properties specifying distances between objects in space-time) fail to distinguish two identical objects in a symmetrical universe. Per his argument, two objects are, and will remain, equidistant from the universe&#x27;s plane of symmetry and each other. Even bringing in an external observer to label the two spheres distinctly does not solve the problem, because it violates the symmetry of the universe.

===Indiscernibility of identicals===
As stated above, the principle of indiscernibility of identicals—that if two objects are in fact one and the same, they have all the same properties—is mostly uncontroversial. However, one famous application of the indiscernibility of identicals was by René Descartes in his &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;. Descartes concluded that he could not doubt the existence of himself (the famous &quot;cogito&quot; argument), but that he &quot;could&quot; doubt the existence of his body.

This argument is criticized by some modern philosophers on the grounds that it allegedly derives a conclusion about what is true from a premise about what people know. What people know or believe about an entity, they argue, is not really a characteristic of that entity. A response may be that the argument in the &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot; is that the inability of Descartes to doubt the existence of his mind is part of his mind&#x27;s essence. One may then argue that identical things should have identical essences.

Numerous counterexamples are given to debunk Descartes&#x27; reasoning via &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot;, such as the following argument based on a secret identity:

#Entities &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are identical if and only if any predicate possessed by &quot;x&quot; is also possessed by &quot;y&quot; and vice versa.
#Clark Kent is Superman&#x27;s secret identity; that is, they&#x27;re the same person (identical) but people don&#x27;t know this fact.
#Lois Lane thinks that Clark Kent cannot fly.
#Lois Lane thinks that Superman can fly.
#Therefore Superman has a property that Clark Kent does not have, namely that Lois Lane thinks that he can fly.
#Therefore, Superman is not identical to Clark Kent.
#Since in proposition 6 we come to a contradiction with proposition 2, we conclude that at least one of the premises is wrong. Either:
#* Leibniz&#x27;s law is wrong; or
#* A person&#x27;s knowledge about &quot;x&quot; is not a predicate of &quot;x&quot;; or
#* The application of Leibniz&#x27;s law is erroneous; the law is only applicable in cases of monadic, not polyadic, properties; or
#* What people think about are not the actual objects themselves; or
#* A person is capable of holding conflicting beliefs.
:::Any of which will undermine Descartes&#x27; argument.

<text>Mary Louisa &quot;Polly&quot; Toynbee (; born 27 December 1946) is a British journalist and writer. She has been a columnist for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper since 1998.

She is a social democrat and was a candidate for the Social Democratic Party in the 1983 general election. She now broadly supports the Labour Party, although she was critical of its left-wing former leader, Jeremy Corbyn.

Toynbee previously worked as social affairs editor for the BBC and also for &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper. She is vice-president of Humanists UK, having previously served as its president between 2007 and 2012. She was named Columnist of the Year at the 2007 British Press Awards. She became a patron of right-to-die organization My Death My Decision in 2021.

==Background==
Toynbee was born at Yafford on the Isle of Wight, the second daughter of the literary critic Philip Toynbee by his first wife Anne Barbara Denise (1920-2004), daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel George Powell, of the Grenadier Guards.

Her grandfather was the historian Arnold J. Toynbee, her grandmother was Rosalind Murray, and her great-grand uncle the philanthropist and economic historian Arnold Toynbee, after whom Toynbee Hall in the East End of London is named. Her parents divorced when Toynbee was aged four and she moved to London with her mother, who married the philosopher Richard Wollheim.

Toynbee attended Badminton School, a private girls&#x27; school in Bristol, leaving with 4 O-levels, which she describes as &#x27;bad&#x27;. She then attended Holland Park School, a state comprehensive school in London, where she took the missing O-levels, passed one A-level, and obtained a scholarship to Oxford University to read history at St Anne&#x27;s College. .

She had a teenage affair and became pregnant. Despite pressure from the father&#x27;s family, and having visited his student sister (mother of the infant Boris Johnson) in Oxford, they decided to separate, and she took illegal abortion-inducing pills. They remained &#x27;remote&#x27; friends.

She dropped out of university after eighteen months, which she regrets, as she was told by her tutor she would. She has variously attributed this to having an affair with a married TV presenter, to having her first novel published in her first term at Oxford, to the pressure of her scholarship and family expectations, and to taking up with Jeremy Sandford.

During her gap year, in 1966, she had worked for Amnesty International in Rhodesia (which had just unilaterally declared independence) until she was expelled by the government. She published her first novel, &quot;Leftovers&quot;, in 1966. Following her expulsion from Rhodesia, Toynbee revealed the existence of the &quot;Harry&quot; letters, which detailed the alleged funding of Amnesty International in Rhodesia by the British government.

After Oxford, she found work in a factory and a burger bar, hoping to write in her spare time. She later said: &quot;I had a loopy idea that I could work with my hands during the day and in the evening come home and write novels and poetry, and be Tolstoy... But I very quickly discovered why people who work in factories don&#x27;t usually have the energy to write when they get home.&quot; She went into journalism, working on the diary at &quot;The Observer&quot;, and turned her eight months of experience in manual work (along with &quot;undercover&quot; stints as a nurse and an Army recruit) into the book &quot;A Working Life&quot; (1970).

==Career==
Toynbee worked for many years at &quot;The Guardian&quot;, before joining the BBC, where she was social affairs editor (1988–1995). At &quot;The Independent&quot;, which she joined after leaving the BBC, she was a columnist and associate editor, working with then editor Andrew Marr. She later rejoined &quot;The Guardian&quot;. She has also written for &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Radio Times&quot;; at one time she was an editor for the &quot;Washington Monthly&quot;.

Following in the footsteps of Barbara Ehrenreich&#x27;s &quot;Nickel and Dimed&quot; (2001), in 2003 she published &quot;Hard Work: Life in Low-pay Britain&quot; about an experimental period voluntarily living on the minimum wage, which was £4.10 per hour at the time. She worked as a hospital porter in a National Health Service hospital, a dinner lady in a primary school, a nursery assistant, a call-centre employee, a cake factory worker and a care home assistant, during which time she contracted salmonella. The book is critical of conditions in low pay jobs in Britain. She also contributed an introduction to the UK edition of Ehrenreich&#x27;s &quot;Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America&quot;.

Currently Toynbee writes for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and serves as President of the Social Policy Association. She is chair of the Brighton Festival and deputy treasurer of the Fabian Society.

==Political history and opinions==

Toynbee has written about her privilege in the British class system, saying that all her family &quot;lived on the left ... locked in combat with the ... forces of conservatism&quot;, but were clearly members of a privileged class. Toynbee did badly at school as she was &quot;too rebellious to work, too angry to obey, too impatient to get out of there&quot;; she attributed her gaining an Oxford scholarship to its &quot;heavily class-biased exam&quot; being designed &quot;to reward people of exactly my background&quot;. After deliberately taking on menial jobs, she took a job that led to her becoming a journalist, something she had never intended. 

Toynbee is a member of the Labour Party. She and her first husband, Peter Jenkins (from 1970), were supporters of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) breakaway from Labour in 1981, both signing the Limehouse Declaration. Toynbee stood for the party at the 1983 general election for Lewisham East, garnering 9351 votes (22%) and finishing third. She was one of the few SDP members who believed in unilateral nuclear disarmament, founding an unsuccessful group &quot;Unilateralists for Social Democracy&quot;. She later refused to support the subsequent merger of the SDP with the Liberals (to form the Liberal Democrats), reacting instead by rejoining Labour only after the rump &#x27;continuing SDP&#x27;, led by David Owen, collapsed in 1990.

In 1995, Toynbee criticised Metropolitan Police Commissioner Paul Condon&#x27;s comments that 80% of mugging cases were committed by black people, stating that it was &quot;an over-simplification that is seriously misleading&quot;. She approvingly quoted academic researcher Michael Keith, who said: &quot;If you were to standardise for everything else – education, unemployment, housing estates, life chances – race on its own would have virtually no significance.&quot;

In a 2002 debate hosted by the Royal Society of Arts and &quot;Prospect&quot; magazine, Toynbee argued that the West should pursue liberal internationalism by intervening through the United Nations to promote democracy around the world: &quot;Spreading people&#x27;s right to self-determination, and their right to think and vote for themselves, is a moral obligation… We should be intervening now in the Congo and Sudan.&quot;

Toynbee strongly supports state education, though she had two of her three children partly educated in the private sector, leading to accusations of hypocrisy. Although consistently critical of many of Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour reforms, she wrote in 2005 that his government &quot;remains the best government of my political lifetime&quot;. During the 2005 General Election, with dissatisfaction high among traditional Labour voters, Toynbee wrote several times about the dangers of protest voting, &quot;Giving Blair a bloody nose&quot;. She urged &quot;Guardian&quot; readers to vote with a clothes peg over their nose if they had to, to make sure Michael Howard&#x27;s Conservatives would not win thanks to vote splitting. &quot;Voters think they can take a free hit at Blair while assuming Labour will win anyway. But Labour won&#x27;t win if people won&#x27;t vote for it.&quot;

In December 2006, Greg Clark (a former SDP member, later to be a Conservative minister) claimed Toynbee should be an influence on the modern Conservative Party, causing a press furore. Reacting to this, Conservative leader David Cameron said he was impressed by one metaphor in her writings – of society being a caravan crossing a desert, where the people at the back can fall so far behind they are no longer part of the tribe. He added, &quot;I will not be introducing Polly Toynbee&#x27;s policies.&quot; Toynbee expressed some discomfort with this embrace, adding, &quot;I don&#x27;t suppose the icebergs had much choice about being hugged by Cameron either.&quot; In response to the episode, Boris Johnson, at the time a Conservative MP and journalist who had been severely criticised by Toynbee, rejected any association with Toynbee&#x27;s views, writing that she &quot;incarnates all the nannying, high-taxing, high-spending schoolmarminess of Blair&#x27;s Britain. Polly is the high priestess of our paranoid, mollycoddled, risk-averse, airbagged, booster-seated culture of political correctness and &#x27;elf &#x27;n&#x27; safety fascism&quot;.

Having advocated for Gordon Brown to succeed Blair as prime minister, Toynbee continued to endorse him in the early part of his premiership. By spring 2009 she had become sharply critical of Brown, arguing that he had failed to introduce the social-democratic policies he promised, and was very poor at presentation too. She subsequently called for his departure, voluntary or otherwise. In the European Elections of June 2009 she advocated a vote for the Liberal Democrats. During the 2010 general election she advocated a tactical vote for whichever candidate was best able to keep the Conservatives out of power.

In October 2010, Toynbee was criticised for an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in which she said the government&#x27;s benefits changes would drive many poor people out of London and could be seen as a &quot;final solution&quot; for their situation. Some people interpreted this as a reference to the Nazis, which Toynbee said was not her intention. A Press Complaints Commission report on the matter ruled the comments were &quot;insensitive&quot;, but did not breach any rules as the organisation&#x27;s remit does not cover matters of taste and offence. She later apologised for using the term.

Toynbee has been described as &quot;the queen of leftist journalists&quot;, and in 2008 topped a poll of 100 &quot;opinion makers&quot;, carried out by Editorial Intelligence. She was also named the most influential columnist in the UK. Andrew Marr has said that &quot;[w]hat makes her stand out as a journalist is not only her strong views but also her ferocious appetite for research. In a media world in which too many media columnists simply voice their top-of-the-head opinions, Polly always arrives heavily armed with hard facts&quot;.

With her partner, former Social Affairs editor of &quot;The Guardian&quot; David Walker (Peter Jenkins died in 1992), Toynbee co-authored two books reviewing the successes and failures of New Labour in power. In &quot;Unjust Rewards&quot; (2008) they argued that &quot;excess at the top hurts others&quot;.

To reduce child poverty in the United Kingdom, Toynbee has supported an increase in the Working Tax Credit. She has criticized the UK government austerity programme under Conservative governments, and the reduction in the public sector and government services. She has criticised the underfunding of the National Health Service and its adverse effects on patient care.

In the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire, Toynbee wrote that &quot;Political blame spreads right through the Conservative party, with no escape on offer. This goes far beyond the precise shockers – the Tory MPs who mockingly rejected housing regulation; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; the disregard of coroner&#x27;s instructions after the 2009 Lakanal House tragedy; and even the plan to opt out of EU safety regulations. Conservative Kensington and Chelsea council allegedly blocking its ears to tenants&#x27; well-founded anxiety is just the immediate scandal. But this event reaches far deeper, to the very sinews of its party&#x27;s policy.&quot;

She is a strong opponent of Brexit.

==Views==
===Views on politics===
Writing about the government of PM Rishi Sunak in November 2022, Toynbee argued that choosing Suella Braverman as home secretary was a blunder and that Braverman&#x27;s promise to reduce immigration to &quot;tens of thousands&quot; was unworkable since more than 270,000 people arrived during the year to March 2022, mostly with visas. Only small numbers arrived in boats.&quot; Toynbee further said that Braverman&#x27;s &quot;dreams&quot; about Rwanda and cruelty and putting arrivals into squalid conditions in the Manston processing centre disrupted policy.&quot;

Toynbee also criticised Sunak&#x27;s initial decision to miss the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Later Sunak changed his mind and decided he would attend the COP27 conference.

===Views on religion===

An atheist, Toynbee is an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society, a supporter of the Humanist Society Scotland, and was appointed President of the British Humanist Association in July 2007. Since 2012, she has been the BHA&#x27;s vice president. She has said that she is simply a consistent atheist, and is just as critical of Christianity, Islam and Judaism. She wrote: &quot;The pens sharpen—Islamophobia! No such thing. Primitive Middle Eastern religions (and most others) are much the same—Islam, Christianity and Judaism all define themselves through disgust for women&#x27;s bodies.&quot; In 1997 she declared &quot;I am an Islamophobe and proud of it&quot;. In 2005 she opposed the Bill to outlaw incitement to religious hatred: &quot;Race is something people cannot choose and it defines nothing about them. But beliefs are what people choose to identify with...The two cannot be blurred into one—which is why the word Islamophobia is a nonsense&quot;.

In 2003, upon the 25th anniversary of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s papacy, she wrote that he &quot;is a hate-figure and with good reason… No one can compute how many people have died of Aids as a result of Wojtyla&#x27;s power, how many woman have died in childbirth needlessly, how many children starved in families too large and poor to feed them. But it is reasonable to suppose these silent, unseen, uncounted deaths at his hand would match that of any self-respecting tyrant or dictator&quot;. In 2011 she accepted an invitation to participate in a debate with the Christian philosopher William Lane Craig on the existence of God but Toynbee later pulled out stating &quot;...this is not my kind of forum&quot;.

Toynbee has mixed feelings about the Church of England; she has opposed both religious and secular dogmatic beliefs. In April 2014, she wrote:
==Honours==
Toynbee was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Essex in 1999 and by London South Bank University in 2002. In 2004, she was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from Loughborough University. In 2005, she was made an Honorary Doctor of The Open University for &quot;her notable contribution to the educational and cultural well-being of society&quot;. The University of Kent awarded Toynbee the honorary title of Doctor of Civil Law in November 2007 in recognition of her concern with poverty and welfare. This was followed in 2008 when University of Leeds awarded her fourth honorary doctorate. and in 2007 was named &#x27;Columnist of the Year&#x27; at the British Press Awards. Toynbee declined to be made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000.

==Personal life==
Toynbee lives in Lewes, East Sussex. She also owns a villa in Tuscany.
She is a member of the Arts Emergency Service.

<text>Charles Augustus Young (December 15, 1834 – January 4, 1908) one of the foremost solar spectroscopist astronomers in the United States. He observed solar eclipses and worked on spectroscopy of the Sun. He observed a solar flare with a spectroscope on 3 August 1872, and also noted that it coincided with a magnetic storm on Earth.

Young graduated from Dartmouth College in 1853. For two years, he taught classes at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. The following year, he studied at the theological seminary in Andover, while also continuing to teach.

In 1857, he became the Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Western Reserve College, now known as Case Western Reserve University, devoting nine years. Young&#x27;s name is inscribed on the Loomis Observatory, which is the oldest observatory in the United States still remaining in its original location.

In 1862, he served in the 85th Regiment of Ohio during the Civil War.

He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1874.

in 1865, he became a professor at his alma mater, Dartmouth, remaining until 1877 when he went to teach at Princeton University.

He was a successful educator who wrote a popular and widely used series of astronomy textbooks, including &quot;Manual of Astronomy&quot;. In 1927, when Henry Norris Russell, Raymond Smith Dugan and John Quincy Stewart wrote their own two-volume textbook, they entitled it &quot;Astronomy: A Revision of Young&#x27;s Manual of Astronomy&quot;.

Young died of pneumonia after a brief illness, at his home in Hanover, New Hampshire, on 4 January 1908.

Mount Young in Sequoia National Park, California was named in his honor in 1909.

<doc id="630410" wikidata="Q2413919" url="?curid=630410" title="Enjoy Incubus">
<text>Enjoy Incubus is the second EP and major label debut by American rock band Incubus. It was released on January 7, 1997, by Epic and Immortal Records. It contained re-recordings of songs that were featured on their previous, independent releases &quot;Let Me Tell Ya &#x27;Bout Root Beer&quot; and &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot;, as well the previously unreleased song &quot;Version&quot; and an untitled hidden track at the end of &#x27;&quot;Hilikus&quot;. It was the first appearance on a release by DJ Lyfe, who added turntable scratches to the &quot;Fungus Amongus&quot; songs, and also supplied saxophone samples. This release was also noted for its introduction of &#x27;Chuck&#x27;, the mysterious mustachioed man who has become an icon for Incubus&#x27;s early work. It is also the only Incubus release to feature a Parental Advisory label, despite many of their other albums also containing profanity.

==Background==
&quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; marked the beginning of the band&#x27;s career with Sony&#x27;s Epic/Immortal label, who signed them to a seven-record contract in 1996. The EP&#x27;s turntablist DJ Lyfe joined the band in late 1995. He had seen Incubus play live and asked if they would be interested in using some of his hip hop tracks; Lyfe eventually became a full-time member after just one rehearsal. Brandon Boyd&#x27;s singing ability, combined with the band&#x27;s high-energy shows and growing fan base, was what caught the interest of Epic/Immortal.

The EP was released in the US and other countries in January 1997, with the label&#x27;s strategy being to build the band&#x27;s fanbase through touring rather than radio airplay. Incubus subsequently went on a tour of Europe in early 1997, where they were joined by Korn and ska-punk band The Urge. Both Korn and The Urge were Epic/Immortal labelmates of Incubus at that time. The tour would end up being a success, helping expose Incubus to a wider audience. Korn were supporting their &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; album, and live performances from them and the two other bands would be included on a promotional &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot; tour sampler. The tour sampler came as a bonus CD on some editions of &quot;Life Is Peachy&quot;, and the live Incubus track which was included was &quot;Hilikus&quot;. The final show of the tour was in front of more than 5,000 people in Paris. In 1997, Boyd reflected &quot;we had never played in front of a crowd that big, and the response we got far exceeded any response we&#x27;ve ever gotten. To play in front of a crowd that has no idea who you are, and then you start playing and they understand the energy of it and start freaking out, it&#x27;s quite an experience.&quot;

==Reception==
In early 1999, &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; and the band&#x27;s full-length major label debut &quot;S.C.I.E.N.C.E.&quot; were estimated to have sold a combined total of 200,000 units. The 2003 book &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; states that &quot;Enjoy Incubus&quot; &quot;showcased a band with a singer whose vocal style came uncomfortably close to that of Faith No More crooner Mike Patton and a guitarist keen to make like the Chili Peppers&#x27; John Frusciante.&quot; In October 2001, Sean Richardson of &quot;The Phoenix&quot; had a mixed view of the EP, writing &quot;back then, they were considered a cheap 311 knockoff with a singer who did a decent impersonation of former Faith No More frontman Mike Patton — not the most auspicious way to begin a career in rock.&quot;

==Track listing==
Notes
* &quot;Hilikus&quot; ends at 3:57. An untitled hidden track (often referred to as &quot;Hidden Bonus&quot;) starts at 13:59, after ten minutes and two seconds of silence. On streaming, it is listed as a separate seventh track.
* Exactly 3:40 into &quot;Azwethinkweiz&quot;, a hidden message of Boyd saying something backwards can be heard: &quot;Thursday night, we smoked indica, and &#x27;azwethinkweizm&#x27; was born.&quot; (see backmasking).

==Personnel==
* Brandon of the Jungle – vocals, percussion
* Dynamike – guitars
* Kid Lyfe – scratches
* Dirk Lance – bass
* José Antonio Pasillas II – drums

<text>Friedrich August Theodor Winnecke (5 February 1835 in Groß-Heere, near Hannover – 3 December 1897 in Bonn) was a German astronomer.

Winnecke worked at Pulkovo Observatory near Saint Petersburg from 1858 to 1865, but returned to Germany and served as professor of astronomy in Strasbourg from 1872 to 1881.

He discovered or co-discovered a large number of comets, including the periodic comet 7P/Pons-Winnecke and the comet once known as &quot;Pons-Coggia-Winnecke-Forbes&quot; but later renamed to 27P/Crommelin after Andrew Crommelin, who computed its orbit.

Winnecke also compiled a list of double stars, the Winnecke Catalogue of Double Stars, in 1869. He also found a number of nebulae.

The asteroid 207 Hedda, discovered by Johann Palisa in 1879, was named after Winnecke&#x27;s wife Hedwig.

<text>Kioumars Saberi Foumani (August 29, 1941 – April 30, 2004) () also known with his pen name Gol-Agha (), was an Iranian satirist, writer, and teacher.

==Education and personal life==
Saberi was born during the Second World War in Sowme&#x27;eh Sara
(), a city in Gilan Province. His father, originally from Rasht, worked for the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance. He was transferred to Sowme&#x27;eh Sara in 1938 and then to Fuman in 1942 where he died a few months later.

His mother, who was the daughter of a respected cleric and one of the few educated women in the city, taught the Quran after the death of her husband. His brother, who was 14 years older, had to leave school at the age of 15 to work to help with the family expenses.

Education for Saberi was hard because of his family&#x27;s poverty and he had to start working in a tailor shop after finishing his elementary education. He also worked in his brother&#x27;s bicycle repair shop during elementary school and high school.

He started high school education at his mother&#x27;s insistence. At the age of 16, he gained entry to Sari&#x27;s Agriculture teacher&#x27;s college () that only accepted one student from Fuman each year. He continued his college education and graduated in 1959. He worked as a teacher from 1959 to 1961.

At the age of 20, he took his high school exams and received his high school diploma. He continued his education at the University of Tehran while working as a teacher. He achieved his Bachelor of Science degree in political science in 1965.

He spent most of the 1970s reading and teaching and in 1978 he obtained his master&#x27;s degree in comparative literature from the University of Tehran.

Saberi got married in 1966 and he had a daughter and a son. His son died in a car accident in 1985 but this sad incident did not stop him from reaching his goal, which was to make people smile.

Kioumars Saberi Foumani died on April 30, 2004.

==Political involvement==
During his first year at university, Saberi was arrested for participating in student demonstrations and started to write political satire in &quot;Towfigh&quot; magazine. &quot;Towfigh&quot; magazine was Iran&#x27;s most respected pro-democracy political satire magazine, with the highest circulation in Iranian history. Its editor in chief was Hossein Towfigh who, along with his brothers Hassan and Abbas, turned &quot;Towfigh&quot; magazine into the most influential journal in Iranian history. Saberi became one of the many staff writers of &quot;Towfigh&quot; magazine.

After the Iranian Revolution, he became the cultural advisor for Mohammad Ali Rajai. One of his other political posts was as the counselor to the minister of Housing and Urban Development of Iran.

==Writings==
Saberi composed his first poem of the ghazal form when he was 14 and he named it &quot;Orphan&quot; (). His first published writing was another poem called &quot;Orphan&quot; which was published in &quot;Omid Iran&quot; magazine. His writings before the Iranian Revolution were mainly published in &quot;Towfigh&quot;.

He was one of the contributors of a political satire magazine &quot;Tawfiq&quot;. His pen names in the magazine included &quot;Mirza-Gol&quot; (), &quot;Abdolfanoos&quot; (), &quot;Rish-Sefid&quot; (; meaning a white-bearded and knowledgeable person), &quot;Lode&quot; ( clown), &quot;Gardan-Shekasteye-Fumani&quot; (; meaning &quot;a person from Fuman with broken neck&quot;).

Following the Revolution, Saberi worked in different political positions before deciding to leave politics. He was in charge of &quot;Roshde-Adabe-Farsi&quot; magazine and sometimes he wrote for the &quot;Ettelaat&quot; newspaper. He started a column called &quot;Do-Kalame-Harfe-Hesab&quot; in &quot;Ettelaat&quot; in 1984 that was a starting point for political satires after the revolution. He continued writing for this column for six years until he started his own magazine called &quot;Gol-Agha&quot; in 1990. His courageous and powerful writings were appreciated by many famous authors such as Mohammad Ali Jamalzadeh. Saberi received first prize in press exhibition of 1992 and 1994 and second prize in 1993. He stopped writing for &quot;Ettelaat&quot; in 1993.

The main characters in his writings are Gol-Agha, Shagholam, &quot;Mamasadegh&quot;, &quot;Kamineh&quot; (The wife of Mamasadegh), &quot;Mash-Rajab&quot; and &quot;Ghazanfar&quot;.

In 2003 in his last editorial in &quot;Gol-Agha&quot;, Saberi announced that publishing &quot;Gol-Agha&quot; would be stopped without providing any reasons, explicitly. He wrote that he has been thinking most of his time for the last three months, and tried to write this announcement many times.

His publications include:

# &quot;The Command from Ali to Malik ibn Ashter&quot; (1978) ()
# Analyzing the story of Zahhak and Kaveh the Blacksmith ()
# &quot;The Correspondence between Shahid Rajai and Banisadr&quot; ()
# &quot;The First interpellation in the Islamic Republic of Iran&quot; ()
# &quot;Visiting the Soviet Union&quot; ()
# &quot;Collection of Do-Kalame-Harfe-Hesab (Volume 1, 2, 3, 4)&quot; ()

<doc id="630420" wikidata="Q7980616" url="?curid=630420" title="Welcome Freshmen">
<text>Welcome Freshmen is an American comedy series that aired on Nickelodeon from February 16, 1991, to February 19, 1994, with repeats until October 27, 1996. The show took place at Hawthorne High School with a group of high school students and a bumbling vice principal.

==Seasons 1 and 2==
The earlier episodes of the series consisted of comedy sketches that loosely followed a theme, each episode had two or three short skits about the gang&#x27;s misadventures in high school. Some of the comedy routines involved a tortoise named Mortise teaching children about safety, a historian named Mr. History who talks about past generations of freshmen, the bumbling, freshman-hating, vice-principal Mr. Lippman imagining himself as a stand-up comedian telling really bad old jokes that insult freshmen, and a student named Billy Cushman who, though his appearance was occasional, provided not only a good example of how not to behave but also a good example of flatulence.

===Recurring skits===
* Home-Room Announcements – Mr. Lippman, the vice-principal, doing the morning announcements (at the same time, imagining how he&#x27;d really like to say them as a stand-up format).
* The Merv-U-Mentary – Merv&#x27;s amateurish attempt at uncovering news and scandals at the high school.
* Mr. History – featuring the gang as high school students of a past time period.
* Mike Who – featuring close-ups of a sidelined high school basketball player driving the crowd wild with a single wave. Eventually cut after vice Principal Lippman said it was too distracting, resulting in a tense showdown between Lippman and Who.
* Mortise the Safety Tortoise – a tortoise who teaches children about safety.

==Seasons 3 and 4==
In the later episodes, the sketch comedy format was abandoned, and the show became a standard sitcom.

In the third season, Kevin and Alex become sophomores, Walter is held behind due to him missing summer school. Merv and Tara left Hawthorne, with Merv skipping the rest of high school and going straight to college, and Tara moving to a biosphere with her family. New characters came in: Grant, Erin and Manny, by the end of the third season, Manny left. In the series finale, Walter becomes a sophomore as the teachers all threatened to quit if they had him for another year.

==Production==
The show&#x27;s first television pilot was filmed in May 1990, featuring a group of local actors in the main roles, among them was future Backstreet Boys member Howie Dorough. After the success of the pilot, the show was picked up, but the roles were recast, according to series creator Bob Mittenthal &quot;Those kids did a good job, the proof is that the show was picked up as a series , but research told Nickelodeon it needed better-defined characters&quot;.

<doc id="630426" wikidata="Q4869491" url="?curid=630426" title="Baton round">
<text>Baton rounds, also known as kinetic impact projectiles (KIPs), are a less lethal alternative to traditional bullets. Baton rounds are designed to impact rather than to penetrate and are typically used for riot control.

Common types of baton round have included the:

* Bean bag round, a less-lethal projectile fired from a normal 12-gauge shotgun
* Plastic baton round or plastic bullet, a less-lethal projectile fired from a specialised gun
* Rubber baton round, commonly called the rubber bullet, a rubber-coated projectile with a metal or ceramic core.
* Wooden baton round (which are meant to be skipped off the ground into the targeted area), also called a wooden bullet (a bullet is a direct impact round).
* Foam baton round, also called a sponge grenade

Such munitions are meant to cause pain and incapacitation but not penetrate flesh. However, baton rounds can cause death and serious injuries such as damage to internal organs, permanent disabilities including blindness, especially when fired from close range at the head, neck, chest, or abdomen.

==History==
The use of baton rounds dates back to the 1880s, when Singapore police fired sections of broom handle at demonstrators in Singapore. The Hong Kong police subsequently developed wooden baton rounds, but they were likely to splinter and cause wounds.

Rubber bullets were invented by the British Ministry of Defence for use against rioters in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, and were first used there in 1970.

Rubber bullets tend to bounce uncontrollably, and have largely been replaced by other types of baton rounds, including plastic bullets: solid PVC cylinders 10 cm long, 38 mm in diameter, and weighing 135g. They were invented by Porton Down scientists and intended for use against rioters in Northern Ireland, first used there in 1973.

==Injuries==
In a 1975 study of injuries in 90 patients injured by rubber bullets, 1 died, 17 suffered permanent disabilities or deformities and 41 required hospital treatment after being fired upon with rubber baton rounds. A review of studies covering multiple different munition types/designs, which covered 1,984 people injured by &quot;kinetic impact projectiles&quot; and found that 53 died, plus 300 permanently disabled. Baton rounds can cause blindness as shown by their use by police in the 2019-2020 Chilean protests. During the first 3–4 months of protests in Chile, rubber bullets contributed to have a toll of 427 persons with eye injuries, an extremely high number when comparing to other protests or conflict zones in the world.

<doc id="630429" wikidata="Q323549" url="?curid=630429" title="Thomas William Webb">
<text>Thomas William Webb (14 December 1807 – 19 May 1885) was a British astronomer. Some sources give his year of birth as 1806. The only son of a clergyman, the Reverend John Webb, he was raised and educated by his father, his mother having died while Thomas was a small child. He went to Oxford where he attended Magdalen Hall. In 1829 was ordained a minister in the Anglican Church. He was married to Henrietta Montague Wyatt (1820-1884) in 1843, daughter of Mr. Arthur Wyatt, Monmouth. Mrs. Webb died on 7 September 1884, and after a year of declining health Thomas died on 19 May 1885.

Through his career T. W. Webb served as a clergyman at various places including Gloucester, and finally in 1852 was assigned to the parish of Hardwicke in Herefordshire near the border with Wales. In addition to serving faithfully the members of his parish, T. W. Webb pursued astronomical observation in his spare time. On the grounds of the vicarage or parsonage he built a small canvas and wood observatory that was home to instruments including a small 3.7&quot; (94mm) refracting telescope. Webb acquired progressively larger refractors and reflectors, the largest was a 9-1/3&quot; (225mm) aperture silver on glass reflector used from 1866 until his last observation in March 1885. It was at Hardwick that he wrote his classic astronomical observing guide &quot;Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes&quot; in 1859 for which he is best known today. This work was written as a guide for the amateur astronomer, containing instructions on the use of a telescope as well as detailed descriptions of what could be observed with it. This work became the standard observing guide of amateur astronomers worldwide, and remained so until well into the 20th Century, gradually supplanted by more modern guides such as Burnham&#x27;s &quot;Celestial Handbook.&quot;

The title&#x27;s reference to &quot;common telescopes&quot; refers to refractors of 3 to 6 inches (76-152mm) aperture and the somewhat larger reflectors that were commonly available to the amateur observers of the day.

In 1852 Webb was elected to the Royal Astronomical Society. &quot;Celestial Objects for Common Telescopes&quot; was first published in 1859. Successive editions appeared in 1868, 1873, and 1881. In 1878 Webb was an initial member of the Selenographical Society. After Webb&#x27;s death in 1885 the 5th (1893) and 6th editions (1917) were produced under the aegis of T H E C Espin (1858-1934) and expanded to two volumes. In 1962, the reprinted edition was published by Dover Publications, Inc., edited and revised by Margaret W. Mayall. The 1962 edition is still readily available and widely used, while earlier editions have become collectors items and are quite rare.

Webb also wrote &quot;Optics Without Mathematics&quot; (1883) and &quot;The Sun: A Familiar Description of His Phenomena&quot; (1885).

Asteroid 3041 Webb and lunar crater &quot;Webb&quot; were named after him.

A telescopic asterism in the constellation Hercules is called &quot;Webb&#x27;s wreath&quot; by amateur astronomers.

<doc id="630432" wikidata="Q3908420" url="?curid=630432" title="Popples">
<text>Popples is a toy and television franchise created by Those Characters From Cleveland (TCFC), the toy and licensing design division of American Greetings. Popples resemble brightly colored marsupial teddy bears with long tails ending in a pom-pom. Each Popple character transforms to resemble a brightly colored ball. In 2018, Popples was sold to Hasbro.

==History==
Susan Trentel, who worked for TCFC and had created the first prototypes of the Strawberry Shortcake dolls and Care Bears toys, was the plush toy designer who invented the method for transforming the Popple. Supposedly, the idea came from rolling up socks. Trentel worked with art director Thomas Schneider on the creation of the first prototypes (Patent #4614505).

==Toy merchandise==
Popples were manufactured by Mattel between 1986 and 1988. Each toy had a pouch on the back that could be inverted so the character rolled &quot;into&quot; the pouch and resembled a brightly colored ball.

===Original line (1986)===
The first introduction included nine Popples in three different sizes:

* Pretty Cool (P.C. for short) is a male Popple with blue fur, pink hair, orange cheeks and contrasting orange and yellow ears.
* Party is a female Popple, with pink fur, hot pink hair, lavender cheeks and contrasting lavender and pink ears.
* Pancake is a female Popple with purple fur, orange hair, pink cheeks and contrasting blue and pink ears.
* Puzzle is an male Popple with orange fur, green hair, pink cheeks and contrasting blue and red ears. 
* Prize is an female Popple with dark magenta fur, white hair, lavender cheeks and contrasting green and pink ears.
* Puffball is an female Popple with white fur, yellow hair, orange cheeks and contrasting blue and magenta ears.
* Pretty Bit is a female Popple with lavender fur, hot pink hair, pink cheeks and contrasting pink and blue ears.
* Potato Chip is a female Popple with yellow fur, pink hair, pink cheeks and contrasting lavender and magenta ears. 
* Putter is a male Popple with green fur, orange hair, pink cheeks and contrasting red and blue ears.

====Rock Star Popples and Baby Popples====
The second launch brought the Rock Star Popples: Punkity (magenta girl with microphone and star on her belly) and Punkster (blue boy with electric guitar and lightning bolt on his belly) as well as the Popples Babies: Bibsy (white with purple and white bonnet, bib and booties with star pattern) and Cribsy (pink with blue and white striped bonnet, bib and booties). The babies had rattles in their tails and came with a squeaking baby bottle.

====Pufflings====
A line extension brought about Pufflings, which looked like little Popple pets (they were basically a ball of fluff with a face, tiny paws and tail) that could flip inside out to look a bit like a beanie hat and carried riddles and jokes on tags inside them. The Pufflings came in six different colours: Red, yellow, sky blue, purple, white and magenta.

====Sports Popples====
These Popples turned into sports balls: Big Kick (soccer ball), Dunker (basketball), Touchdown (football), PC Pitcher (baseball) and Net Set (tennis ball). The Sports Popples included Cuester, who turned into an 8-ball, but no toy was made of him. Similarly, no toy was made of the original Pitcher, but a toy was made of PC dressed in a baseball outfit to replace him.

====Other full-sized Popples====
There were numerous other Popples toys made during the series&#x27; original run, including Flower Popples (which could turn into flowers when you flipped them inside out), Pillow Popples (wearing pajamas and turned into sleeping bags), Fruit Popples (which turned into different fruits), and Special Editions with limited distribution (including an animal series only released in Europe with Popples that resembled a parrot, dog and rabbit), and Costume Popples that wore special outfits and turned into something related (such as a ballerina Popple that turned into a handbag).

====Pocket Popples====
Another successful related line of merchandise were Pocket Popples. Based on the same characters as the larger plush Popples, they were scaled to fit in a pocket or bag. They had PVC faces, articulated arms and legs, and fabric ears, tails and pocket (where they hid).

===2001 relaunch===
In 2001, Toymax relaunched the Popples toy line. This rendition features three characters named Pixie Doodle, Polka Dottie and Pinwheel Penny. Toymax also produced Glow &#x27;N Charm Popples (Pitter Patty, Pizazzy Jazzy and Popsy Daisy) and a Snoozytime Popple wearing pyjamas and a nightcap, as well as celebrity Popples designed and customized by celebrities such as Tiffany, Rachael Leigh Cook, Elisa Donovan, Nicole Oliver, Melissa Joan Hart, Ananda Lewis, Shoshanna Lonstein, Jessica Biel and Christina Ricci.

===2007 relaunch===
A second relaunch was attempted by Playmates Toys (who is also the current manufacturer of toys featuring another American Greetings property, Strawberry Shortcake) in 2007. This rendition features four characters, KissyPopp (pink), HappyPopp (yellow), PrettyPopp (purple) and MonsterPopp (blue), marketed under the name &#x27;Popp &#x27;N Giggles Popples&#x27; which contain a sound box that makes a popping sound followed by a giggle when the Popple comes out of its pouch (or when the shoulders of the Popple are pressed down while in its box, or sitting on a hard surface). Also released in 2007 was an updated version of Popples &#x27;Pufflings&#x27; called &#x27;Popp &#x27;N Mini Message Popples&#x27;, SpeedyPopp (red), FriendlyPopp (purple), RiddlePopp (blue) and SecretPopp (pink) which could record a &#x27;message&#x27; and play it back.

There are also mini plush Popples in the style of the original 1980s Popples available in Japan and other Asian countries, resembling Party, Puffball and Potato Chip. Merchandise such as bags, clothing, keychains, iron-on patches and stationery featuring the classic Popples exist as well.

===2015 relaunch===
Coinciding with the new &quot;Popples&quot; series on Netflix, another revived attempt at the toy line was released in November 2015 by Spin Master and Saban Brands, introducing new characters Bubbles, Lulu, Sunny, Izzy, and Yikes.

===2020 and 2025 relaunches===
In 2020, Funko, in association with Hasbro, launched Funko Pop vinyl figures of the original 1980s Popples, featuring characters P.C. and Prize.

In September 2024, The Loyal Subjects inked a deal with Hasbro to relaunch a host of legacy brands, including Popples. A new line of Popples toys will release in late 2025.

==Television media==
Popples was a Saturday morning cartoon, based on the Popples toys, that aired in the United States from 1986 to 1987. The pilot was a live-action special, produced by Shelley Duvall, in which there were puppets and marionettes. After this was well-received, it was decided to make a cartoon series with the same characters.

===Original series===

The original &quot;Popples&quot; animated series was broadcast in United States, and later rebroadcast in the United Kingdom.

===Netflix series: 2015===

The franchise was adapted for a Netflix original series that premiered in October 2015.

==Other media==
Star Comics released a four-issue series between 1986 and 1987, coinciding with the original cartoon.

<doc id="630451" wikidata="Q116655" url="?curid=630451" title="Hugo Hadwiger">
<text>Hugo Hadwiger (23 December 1908 in Karlsruhe, Germany – 29 October 1981 in Bern, Switzerland) was a Swiss mathematician, known for his work in geometry, combinatorics, and cryptography.

==Biography==
Although born in Karlsruhe, Germany, Hadwiger grew up in Bern, Switzerland. He did his undergraduate studies at the University of Bern, where he majored in mathematics but also studied physics and actuarial science. He continued at Bern for his graduate studies, and received his Ph.D. in 1936 under the supervision of Willy Scherrer. He was for more than forty years a professor of mathematics at Bern.

==Mathematical concepts named after Hadwiger==
Hadwiger&#x27;s theorem in integral geometry classifies the isometry-invariant valuations on compact convex sets in &quot;d&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space. According to this theorem, any such valuation can be expressed as a linear combination of the intrinsic volumes; for instance, in two dimensions, the intrinsic volumes are the area, the perimeter, and the Euler characteristic.

The Hadwiger–Finsler inequality, proven by Hadwiger with Paul Finsler, is an inequality relating the side lengths and area of any triangle in the Euclidean plane. It generalizes Weitzenböck&#x27;s inequality and was generalized in turn by Pedoe&#x27;s inequality. In the same 1937 paper in which Hadwiger and Finsler published this inequality, they also published the Finsler–Hadwiger theorem on a square derived from two other squares that share a vertex.

Hadwiger&#x27;s name is also associated with several important unsolved problems in mathematics:
*The Hadwiger conjecture in graph theory, posed by Hadwiger in 1943 and called by “one of the deepest unsolved problems in graph theory,” describes a conjectured connection between graph coloring and graph minors. The Hadwiger number of a graph is the number of vertices in the largest clique that can be formed as a minor in the graph; the Hadwiger conjecture states that this is always at least as large as the chromatic number.
*The Hadwiger conjecture in combinatorial geometry concerns the minimum number of smaller copies of a convex body needed to cover the body, or equivalently the minimum number of light sources needed to illuminate the surface of the body; for instance, in three dimensions, it is known that any convex body can be illuminated by 16 light sources, but Hadwiger&#x27;s conjecture implies that only eight light sources are always sufficient.
*The Hadwiger–Kneser–Poulsen conjecture states that, if the centers of a system of balls in Euclidean space are moved closer together, then the volume of the union of the balls cannot increase. It has been proven in the plane, but remains open in higher dimensions.
*The Hadwiger–Nelson problem concerns the minimum number of colors needed to color the points of the Euclidean plane so that no two points at unit distance from each other are given the same color. It was first proposed by Edward Nelson in 1950. Hadwiger popularized it by including it in a problem collection in 1961; already in 1945 he had published a related result, showing that any cover of the plane by five congruent closed sets contains a unit distance in one of the sets.

==Other mathematical contributions==
Hadwiger proved a theorem characterizing eutactic stars, systems of points in Euclidean space formed by orthogonal projection of higher-dimensional cross polytopes. He found a higher-dimensional generalization of the space-filling Hill tetrahedra. And his 1957 book &quot;Vorlesungen über Inhalt, Oberfläche und Isoperimetrie&quot; was foundational for the theory of Minkowski functionals, used in mathematical morphology.

==Cryptographic work==
Hadwiger was one of the principal developers of a Swiss rotor machine for encrypting military communications, known as NEMA. The Swiss, fearing that the Germans and Allies could read messages transmitted on their Enigma cipher machines, enhanced the system by using ten rotors instead of five. The system was used by the Swiss army and air force between 1947 and 1992.

==Awards and honors==
Asteroid 2151 Hadwiger, discovered in 1977 by Paul Wild, is named after Hadwiger.

The first article in the &quot;Research Problems&quot; section of the &quot;American Mathematical Monthly&quot; was dedicated by Victor Klee to Hadwiger, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, in honor of Hadwiger&#x27;s work editing a column on unsolved problems in the journal &quot;Elemente der Mathematik&quot;.

<text>The Workers&#x27; Youth League (, , or AUF) is Norway&#x27;s largest political youth organization and is affiliated with the Norwegian Labour Party.

==History==
In 1903, the &quot;Norwegian Social-Democratic Youth League&quot; was formed, which the organization and historians consider to be the foundation of the organization.

As an organizational entity, &quot;AUF&quot; took its current form in April 1927 following the merger of Left Communist Youth League and Socialist Youth League of Norway corresponding with the merger of their parent parties after the conclusion of disputes over the &quot;Twenty-one Conditions&quot;. Its ideology is social democracy and democratic socialism.

The chancellor of Germany and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Willy Brandt was a member of AUF after he fled from the Nazis in 1933 and found exile in Norway.

In 1958, the local chapter of Berge Furre and Kåre Sollund, &quot;Sosialistisk Studentlag&quot;, was closed down. A conflict arose after the United States had been offering its NATO allies American nuclear weapons as a defence against the Eastern Bloc. Sosialistisk Studenlag opposed this and as an attempt to prevent West Germany from getting access to nuclear weapons it contacted MPs during the Easter break to sign a petition. More than half of Labour&#x27;s MPs signed in what is known as the Easter Rebellion of the Labour Party. The rebellion was badly received by the party leadership when the Easter break ended. Several people were excluded from the Labour Party, including the members of Sosialistisk Studentlag. All the MPs who signed the petition were later offered by the party to retract their signatures, which all but one of them did.

Three years later, Furre was one of the founders of Sosialistisk Folkeparti, which got two seats in the parliament after the 1961 election. Labour, who had been winning the majority of the seats in every election after World War II, got just 74 out of 150. No party has won the majority of the seats after this.

In 1998, the Workers&#x27; Youth League membership scandal resulted in two former treasurers and two former leaders of the Oslo chapter being found guilty of fraud, and given prison sentences for having unlawfully received NOK 648,000 in grants from the City of Oslo between 1992 and 1994—Ragnar Bøe Elgsaas, Anders Hornslien, Bjørn Jarle Rødberg Larsen and Anders Greif Mathisen.

Three prime ministers, Trygve Bratteli, Thorbjørn Jagland, and Jens Stoltenberg have been leaders in AUF. In addition, Oddvar Norli was leader of local chapter of Hedmark AUF and Gro Harlem Brundtland was deputy leader of &quot;Sosialistisk Studentlag&quot; and &quot;Arbeiderpartiets Studentlag&quot;, local chapters of AUF, before they both served as prime ministers.

== Utøya mass shooting ==
On 22 July 2011, AUF&#x27;s traditional summer camp on the island of Utøya was the scene of a massacre carried out by the right-wing extremist terrorist Anders Behring Breivik dressed as a police officer. 

The camp was organised by the AUF, the youth wing of the ruling Norwegian Labour Party (AP). Breivik, dressed in a homemade police uniform and showing false identification, took a ferry to the island and opened fire at the participants, killing 69 and injuring 32. Among the dead were friends of Stoltenberg, and the stepbrother of Norway&#x27;s crown princess Mette-Marit. The Utøya attack is the deadliest mass shooting by a lone individual in modern history.

The attack was the deadliest in Norway since World War II.

== Organisational structure ==
Its current leader is Gaute Børstad Skjervø who succeeded Astrid Willa Eide Hoem in October 2024. AUF employs county secretaries in all 19 counties of Norway.

Its central office is situated at the historical seat of the Norwegian labour movement, Youngstorget in Oslo, in the Peoples&#x27; Theatre building. At the main office the elected leadership work together with different political advisors with national campaigns, organisation and political issues. It is co-located with the offices of the Oslo and Akershus county wards.

The National Congress assembles every second year, and is the supreme body of the Workers&#x27; Youth League. The Congress will also elect the party leadership, consisting of a leader, a deputy leader and a secretary general. These three together with 14 other elected members constitutes the Executive Board. On a day-to-day basis AUF is governed by the Executive Board. The highest body between the Congress is the National Delegate&#x27;s Board, consisting of two representatives from each of the 19 counties and is observed by the Executive Board.

The party magazine is Frihet, with roots back to 1923.

The organization is a full member of the International Union of Socialist Youth (IUSY) and the Joint Committee of the Nordic Labour Youth Movement (FNSU). AUF is also an observer member of the Young European Socialists (YES).

<text>Three Days Grace is the debut studio album by Canadian rock band Three Days Grace, released on July 22, 2003, through Jive Records. It was the band&#x27;s only album as a trio, and also under Bertelsmann Music Group.

==Background and writing==
Prior to being named Three Days Grace, the band was known as Groundswell. Three Days Grace garnered the attention of many record labels after the release of their demo, largely due to the song, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;. Eventually, Three Days Grace signed with Jive and began recording their debut album in Massachusetts. The single &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; was released in promotion for the album.

According to drummer Neil Sanderson, the album&#x27;s material comes from the &quot;crazy things&quot; the group had seen growing up. Singer Adam Gontier stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t find it easy to write about happy shit. You don&#x27;t need a release when you&#x27;re happy.&quot; The group completed half of the album at Long View Farm in North Brookfield, Massachusetts, while the rest was done at Bearsville Studios in Bearsville, New York. The album&#x27;s theme deals with &quot;growing up in a small town, being bullied around and everybody knowing your business.&quot;

The band began touring with Trapt in July 2003 in support of the album. During this tour, the group added a new member, guitarist Barry Stock, who joined the band after they held auditions for another guitarist. The group later joined Nickelback on The Long Road Tour throughout October and November 2003. The band embarked on a headlining tour called the Three Days Grace World Tour in 2004. They also supported Evanescence on a North American tour in July 2004 and Hoobastank on the Let it Out Tour in November 2004. In October 2004, the band re-released their debut album with a bonus DVD that contained, music videos of their singles, behind the scenes videos, backstage footage and concert clips shot in Brazil.

==Composition==
The group spent roughly six months to record the album, while the songs on the record were written over the course of ten years. On &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;, the band recorded two guitar parts for the song, the main guitar part and intro riff. The opening riff was recorded on a Yamaha acoustic through an Amp Farm and the group liked the way it sounded with the acoustic guitar and ended up using it on the final production. On the fourth track, &quot;Home&quot;, the band was coming up with different ideas and lead parts &quot;that might sound cool,&quot; according to Gontier. They eventually recorded a high-pitch guitar lead that can be heard at the beginning of the song. They used a whammy pedal to &quot;bring the whole tone up a whole octave,&quot; which was played around the 12th fret. On the album&#x27;s lead track, &quot;Burn&quot;, the band was in the studio and started &quot;dumping a jar of pennies on a guitar,&quot; according to Sanderson. They added some distortion which sounded like fire and the band thought it fit the title of the track really well.

==Critical reception==

The album was met with positive reviews from most music critics. Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album a positive review, saying, &quot;Although this debut is a little uneven, it&#x27;s also promising. Three Days Grace are definitely one of the most accessible alt-metal bands of the 2000s; they just need to add some more distinctiveness to their sound.&quot; She praised the group&#x27;s songwriting on tracks such as &quot;Born Like This&quot;, &quot;Just Like You&quot;, and &quot;Scared&quot;. She also called the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot;, the band&#x27;s &quot;best song, gaining most of its power from its directness and bluntness in examining a dysfunctional relationship.&quot; 

Dave Doray of IGN gave another positive review, remarking, &quot;almost every single song from the &quot;Three Days Grace&quot; track list is heavy and catchy, with chewy chunks of assurance and fury thrown in for added measure.&quot; Kaj Roth of Melodic stated, &quot;Three Days Grace plays tough modern rock, standing on classic hard rock ground like a mix between Depswa and Shinedown.&quot; He complimented the song &quot;Scared&quot; for its guitar harmonies calling it, &quot;real refreshing.&quot; However he was critical on the tracks, &quot;Burn&quot; and &quot;Now or Never&quot; for the lack of &quot;good melodies.&quot; In a mixed review, &quot;Rough Edge&quot; compared the group&#x27;s sound to Finger Eleven and Trapt stating, &quot;Sanitized for mass consumption, there&#x27;s nothing about &quot;Three Days Grace&quot; that we haven&#x27;t heard before from other anguished, mid-tempo rock acts of the last ten years.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; gave a more negative review calling the album, &quot;generic Canadian gripe rock.&quot;

On the 20th anniversary of the album, Issy Herring of &quot;Distorted Sound&quot; gave a positive review for the album. She praised the album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; stating, &quot;The lyrics are timelessly relatable [...] with all of us undeniably experiencing a toxic relationship at some point in our personal lives.&quot; She also praised the album&#x27;s eleventh track, &quot;Take Me Under&quot; remarking, &quot;The nu-metal/grunge inspired guitar melodies make the track even more sensational and somewhat sentimental to any 90s kid growing up listening to this absolute masterpiece.&quot; However she was critical on the tracks &quot;Overrated&quot; and &quot;Born Like This&quot; for its underwhelming chorus. She ended off noting, &quot;the release may be dotted with slight disappointments, but there is no doubt that the highlights triumph the rest.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Three Days Grace&quot; debuted at No. 194 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and in its first week, the album sold no more than 34,000 copies. The album later peaked at No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in 2004 and sold 356,000 copies that year. In 2006, the album sold over 1.2 million copies in the US. As of June 2007, the album sold more than 1.5 million copies. The album also entered the Canadian Albums Chart at No. 9 and sold 5,000 copies in its first week. According to the Nielsen SoundScan, the album has since sold over 335,000 units in Canada.

==Accolades==
The album has been certified platinum in Canada and 2× Platinum in the US. The album earned them a CASBY Award for Favourite New Artist in 2003. The lead single &quot;I Hate Everything About You&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Video and Favourite Canadian Group at the 2004 MuchMusic Video Awards. Producer Gavin Brown won Producer of the Year for the song at the 2004 Juno Awards. The song also peaked at number one on the Canadian rock chart becoming their first number-one hit in the country. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Just Like You&quot; became the first of many of the band&#x27;s songs to top the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Airplay and Mainstream Rock charts.

<doc id="630457" wikidata="Q1691516" url="?curid=630457" title="Joe Malone">
<text>Maurice Joseph Malone (February 28, 1890 – May 15, 1969) was a Canadian professional ice hockey centre. He played in the National Hockey Association (NHA) and National Hockey League (NHL) for the Quebec Bulldogs, Montreal Canadiens, and Hamilton Tigers from 1910 to 1924. Known for his scoring feats and clean play, Malone led the NHL in goals and points in 1918 and 1920, and the NHA in goals twice, in 1913 and 1917 (in a tie). He won the Stanley Cup with Quebec in 1912 and 1913. 

One of the first hockey superstars of the early 20th century, Malone holds or shares 13 NHL records that have stood unbroken over a century after his retirement, including seven that have never been matched. In the inaugural 1917–18 NHL season, Malone scored 2.20 goals per game over 20 games played, a single-season record that remains the highest ever. He is also the only player in the history of the NHL to score seven goals in a single game, accomplishing the feat in 1920. Malone was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950.

==Personal life==
Malone, the second of eleven children, was born in Saint-Colomb-de-Sillery, a town outside of Quebec City, on February 28, 1890. His father, Maurice Joseph Malone, was of Irish descent and also related to the Gignac family, of Quebecois origin. His mother was Marie-Louise Rochon, who was Quebecois herself. Maurice Joseph worked in the lumber industry, as did his father and grandfather. In 1916 he married Mathilda Power. During the First World War, Malone worked with the North American Arms Company. After his playing career, Malone worked for a telephone company in Montreal. He died of a heart attack on May 15, 1969, in Montreal, Quebec.

==Playing career==
===1908–1917===

Malone played hockey from an early age: he was noted in local newspapers as early as 1904 for his exploits, with one report calling him &quot;a rising star&quot;. As a junior he played with the Quebec Crescents and in 1909, at the age of 19, he joined the Quebec Bulldogs of the Eastern Canada Hockey Association, making his senior debut on January 2, 1909. He finished tied for third on the team in scoring with 8 goals in 12 games.

The next season, in 1910, a new league, the National Hockey Association (NHA) was formed but did not allow Quebec to join. Malone and several other Quebec players instead signed with the Waterloo Colts in the Ontario Professional Hockey League. With Waterloo Malone played eleven games and scored nine goals. The Quebec club was reformed in 1911 and joined the NHA for the 1910–11 season, so Malone returned to the team, where he scored 9 goals in 13 games. He centred linemates such as Eddie Oatman and Jack Marks, he scored 21 goals in 18 games in the 1911–12 season, sixth overall in scoring, as Quebec finished first in the league, and consequently won the Stanley Cup.

Quebec again won the Cup in 1913 as Malone led the league with 43 goals in 20 games, including a career-best nine goals in a Cup match against Sydney. His brother Jeff Malone also played for Quebec in 1913 when they won the Stanley Cup. Malone finished fourth in the NHA during the 1913–14 season, with 24 goals in 17 games. He missed some games in the 1914–15 season due to spraining an ankle during a game in January 1915, which kept him out until mid-February; in the 12 games he played, he had 16 goals. Malone returned to form for 1915–16 when he finished second in goal scoring in the league with 25 goals in 24 games.

In 1916–17, Malone scored 41 goals in 19 games in the NHA, finishing tied for the scoring lead with Frank Nighbor of the Ottawa Senators. Malone was in the scoring lead until the final game of the season when he played Nighbor and the Senators. Ottawa had two players cover Malone the entire game, while Nighbor was able to score 5 goals and finish tied.

===1917–1924===
When the NHL was founded in 1917, Quebec did not operate a team in its first season, and the team&#x27;s players were sold to the other teams for $700 each; Malone was claimed by the Montreal Canadiens. Playing on what was one of the most powerful forward lines of all time with Newsy Lalonde and Didier Pitre, Malone shifted to left wing to accommodate Lalonde. Malone scored one of the first goals in NHL history, on the league&#x27;s opening night of December 19, 1917; he finished the game with five goals. He had two other games with five goals during the season, and finished with 44 goals in 20 games, leading the league. Malone established a league record for goals in a season that lasted until 1945; his goals-per-game average has not been surpassed. Malone scored at least one goal (and a total of 35 goals) in his first 14 NHL games to set the record for the longest goal-scoring streak to begin an NHL career.

Malone missed the first two games of the 1918–19 season owing to commitments to his job with the North American Arms Company. While he did play part of the season with the Canadiens, he was limited to only playing Saturday home games in Montreal as he could not miss time from work. In the eight games he did play he scored seven goals. In the league final series against Ottawa, he scored five goals in five games; a lingering arm injury held him out of the Stanley Cup Finals against the Seattle Metropolitans, which was cancelled after five games due to the Spanish flu pandemic.

Quebec revived its franchise in 1919 and Malone rejoined the club, once more leading the league in scoring with 39 goals and setting a single-game goal-scoring mark which still stands at seven against Toronto on January 31, 1920. He scored six goals in a second game that season on March 10, 1920, against the Senators. While Malone had 39 goals in 24 games to lead the league in scoring, the team was very weak on the ice, and finished the season with 4 wins and 20 losses, last in the league.

The team was relocated to Hamilton for the 1921 season. Malone did not initially join the team, instead staying in Quebec to attend to his business interests. He joined the team in January 1921, having missed the first four games of the season. He finished fourth in league scoring with 28 goals. He finished fourth in scoring the following season, as well. For 1921–22 he served as a player-coach and manager for the Tigers.

Malone decided to not return to Hamilton for the 1922–23 season. He was traded back to the Canadiens on January 3, 1923, in exchange for Edmond Bouchard. He scored only a single goal that season while generally playing as a substitute. He played ten games without scoring the next season, playing his last game on January 26 against the Toronto St. Patricks.

==Playing style==

Malone spent the majority of his playing career as a centre, and he had a particular penchant for finding open space on the ice for his goal-scoring. Malone earned his famous nickname, &quot;Phantom Joe&quot;, both for his dark eyes and for his ability to find openings offensively and weave his way to the net in an almost invisible fashion. In an era known for its violence and physicality, Malone was regarded more as a finesse player, with another nickname of his being &quot;Gentleman Joe&quot;. Contrary to many other players of his era, such as his Quebec teammate Joe Hall (with the nickname &quot;Bad Joe&quot;) and his Montreal teammate Newsy Lalonde, Malone also did not have a reputation as a particularly rough player, but rather as one of the cleanest players in the game.
Malone was not considered to be one of the fastest players in the game, but rather a smooth player who knew exactly how to position himself around the opposing goal cage. The December 30, 1919 issue of the Ottawa Journal reproduced a conversation between three hockey fans, where a veteran spectator of 25 years, who had seen all the great players in the game, gave echo to this sentiment and compared Malone&#x27;s abilities to those of baseball second baseman Eddie Collins, an opinion the newspaper itself agreed with.

==Legacy==

Malone finished his career with 343 goals and 32 assists over 15 professional seasons. His 179 goals in the NHA were the most in the league&#x27;s history. The 44 goals he scored in the 1917–18 season were an NHL record until Maurice Richard broke it in 1944–45 with 50 goals, while Malone&#x27;s 49 points in 1919–20 were the most until Howie Morenz had 59 in 1927–28. He is also the only player in NHL history to score six goals in a game more than once.

He was elected to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1950 and is also a member of Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame, inducted in 1975. In 1998, he was ranked number 39 on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. The list was announced 74 years after his last game and 91 years after his professional debut, making him the earliest player on the list.

A statue by artist Frédéric Laforge of Malone with a bulldog, entitled &quot;Hommage à Joe Malone&quot;, was inaugurated on June 10, 2021, and is located at Place Jean-Béliveau at the ExpoCité in Quebec City. The statue pays homage to Malone&#x27;s nickname, &quot;Phantom Joe&quot;, being constructed with discs that are spaced apart, giving the illusion of a phantom.

<text>The WWE Championship is a men&#x27;s professional wrestling world heavyweight championship created and promoted by the American promotion WWE, defended on the SmackDown brand division. Since April 2022, the title has been jointly held and defended with the WWE Universal Championship as the Undisputed WWE Championship, but both titles have maintained their individual lineages. It is one of three world titles in WWE, alongside its companion Universal Championship on SmackDown, and the World Heavyweight Championship on Raw. The current champion is Cody Rhodes, who is in his first reign. He won the undisputed title by defeating previous champion Roman Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match at WrestleMania XL Night 2 on April 7, 2024.

The original world championship of the promotion, it was established by the then-World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) on April 25, 1963, as the WWWF World Heavyweight Championship, after the promotion seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) following a dispute over the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers. Since its inception, the title has undergone many name changes due to company name changes and title unifications. It is the oldest championship currently active in WWE, and is presented as being the promotion&#x27;s most prestigious title, with many matches for the title having headlined pay-per-view and livestreaming events—including WWE&#x27;s flagship event WrestleMania. In professional wrestling in general, it is considered to be one of the most prestigious championships of all time.

From its inception until 2001, it was promoted as WWE&#x27;s sole primary championship. An additional world title, the WCW Championship, was added after the then-World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s (WWF) purchase of World Championship Wrestling in early 2001. The titles were later unified as the Undisputed WWF Championship. After the first brand split in 2002 and the promotion being renamed to WWE, the championship became exclusive to SmackDown, dropping the &quot;undisputed&quot; moniker, while the World Heavyweight Championship (2002–2013 version) was created for Raw. ECW became a third brand in 2006, adding the ECW Championship. That title was deactivated in 2010, and the World Heavyweight Championship was unified into the WWE Championship in 2013. The championship was again the sole world title of WWE until the introduction of the Universal Championship with the 2016 brand split and then a new World Heavyweight Championship in 2023. During both brand splits, the WWE Championship has switched brands, usually as a result of the WWE Draft; the 2023 draft moved it back to SmackDown.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

The title was introduced in 1963 with Buddy Rogers becoming the first champion. Its backstory began in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which had various territorial member promotions. In the 1950s, Capitol Wrestling Corporation (CWC) was a member of the NWA and by 1963, its executives held a controlling stake over NWA operations. During this time, Buddy Rogers held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship until January 24, when Lou Thesz defeated Rogers for the championship in a one-fall match. Claiming the title can only be contested in a traditional two-out-of-three falls match, CWC disputed the title change, and thus seceded from the NWA and became the World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF). The WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was then established and awarded to Buddy Rogers with the explanation that he won a fictional tournament in Rio de Janeiro, supposedly defeating Antonino Rocca in the finals. After several years, the WWWF became affiliated with the NWA once again; one of the caveats of rejoining is that the championship would no longer be recognised as a &quot;world championship&quot;, and only as a regional heavyweight championship. In 1979, the WWWF was renamed World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and then after conclusively ending its affiliation with the NWA in 1983, the title regained its &quot;world championship&quot; status and was renamed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Although the full name appeared on the championship belts until 1998, the name was often abbreviated to WWF Championship, which became its official name in 1998.

=== Monday Night War and unification ===
In 1991, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), a member of the NWA, established the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to replace the NWA&#x27;s world title. In 1993, WCW seceded from the NWA and grew to become a rival promotion to the WWF. Both organizations grew into mainstream prominence and were eventually involved in a television ratings war, dubbed the Monday Night War. Near the end of the ratings war, WCW began a financial decline, which culminated in WWF purchasing WCW in March 2001. As a result of the purchase, the WWF acquired, among other assets, WCW&#x27;s championships. Thus, there were two world titles in the WWF: the original WWF Championship and the WCW Championship, which was eventually renamed the &quot;World Championship&quot;.

In December 2001, the two championships were unified at Vengeance. At the event, Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kurt Angle to retain the WWF Championship, while Chris Jericho defeated The Rock for the World Championship. After this, Jericho then defeated Austin, unifying the WWF and World Championships, and becoming the first Undisputed WWF Champion; the Undisputed championship retained the lineage of the WWF Championship and the World Championship was retired. Subsequently, the Big Eagle Belt (formerly representing the WWF Championship) and the Big Gold Belt (formerly representing the World Championship) were used in tandem to represent the Undisputed Championship. Jericho held the championship for four months until he lost it at WrestleMania X8 against Triple H, who was soon after presented with a single championship belt.

=== Disputes ===

The Undisputed Championship continued up through the beginning of the first brand split, which saw wrestlers being drafted to the company&#x27;s main television programs, &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;, each show representing the brand of the same name, with championships assigned to and authority figures appointed for each brand. The holder of the Undisputed Championship was the only male wrestler allowed to appear on both shows.

In May 2002, the WWF was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and the championships were renamed accordingly. At first, the championship remained unaffiliated with either brand as wrestlers from both brands could challenge the champion. Following the appointment of Eric Bischoff and Stephanie McMahon as General Managers of Raw and SmackDown, respectively, Stephanie McMahon convinced then-Undisputed Champion Brock Lesnar to become exclusive to the SmackDown brand, leaving the Raw brand without a world title. In response, on September 2, Bischoff disputed Lesnar&#x27;s status as champion, stating Lesnar was refusing to defend his title against the designated No. 1 contender, Triple H, and awarded the latter with the newly created World Heavyweight Championship. Immediately afterward, Lesnar&#x27;s championship dropped the epithet &quot;Undisputed&quot; and became known as the WWE Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raw9/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the first brand split, the WWE Championship was used as the world title of the SmackDown brand twice and of the Raw brand three times. In all but two cases, the WWE Championship switched brands as a result of the annual draft. In June 2006, WWE established ECW as a third brand, on which former Extreme Championship Wrestling stars and newer talent competed. When ECW&#x27;s Rob Van Dam won the WWE Championship at ECW One Night Stand on June 11, 2006, the championship briefly became a world title of the ECW brand; the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was subsequently reactivated for the ECW brand upon Van Dam&#x27;s title win. Van Dam held both titles until he lost the WWE Championship to Raw&#x27;s Edge the following month. The ECW brand was disbanded in 2010, subsequently deactivating the ECW Championship. In April 2011, WWE ceased going by its full name with the &quot;WWE&quot; abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism, and the first brand split ended that August.

Just prior to the end of the first brand split, a storyline saw CM Punk vowing to leave the company with the WWE Championship when his contract expired on July 17, 2011, the date of the 2011 Money in the Bank pay-per-view. At the event, Punk succeeded in defeating the defending champion John Cena to win the title, and left the company with the physical championship belt. Subsequently, the championship was vacated and Rey Mysterio won an eight-man tournament by defeating The Miz in the finals to be crowned the new WWE Champion, only to subsequently lose it later that night to Cena, for the latter&#x27;s record ninth reign. Punk then returned to WWE with his own championship belt, disputing Cena&#x27;s claim to the title. The two WWE Champions wrestled each other at SummerSlam; Punk defeated Cena to solidify his claim on the title.

=== Reunification and second brand split ===

Following the end of the first brand split in August 2011, both the WWE Champion and World Heavyweight Champion could appear on both &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot;. In November 2013, the night after Survivor Series, reigning World Heavyweight Champion John Cena made a challenge to reigning WWE Champion Randy Orton to determine WWE&#x27;s undisputed world champion. Orton defeated Cena in a TLC match at the pay-per-view on December 15, 2013, to unify the titles. Subsequently, the unified championship was renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship and retained the lineage of the WWE Championship; the World Heavyweight Championship was retired. Orton and subsequent champions held both championship belts until a single championship belt was given to reigning champion Brock Lesnar in August 2014.

After Dean Ambrose became champion in June 2016, the title&#x27;s name was reverted to WWE Championship. In light of the return of the brand split the following month, Ambrose was drafted to SmackDown. Ambrose then retained his title at Battleground on July 24 against Raw draftees Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns, making the title exclusive to SmackDown. On the July 25 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, to address the lack of a world title for the brand, the WWE Universal Championship was created; Finn Bálor became the inaugural champion at SummerSlam. After the unveiling of the Universal title, the WWE Championship was renamed WWE World Championship, but reverted to WWE Championship in December 2016 during AJ Styles&#x27; first reign.

The title changed hands for the first time outside of North America when AJ Styles defeated Jinder Mahal to win his second WWE Championship in Manchester, England on the November 7, 2017, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. This was also the first time in nearly 15 years that the championship changed hands on an episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;; the last time was in 2003 when Brock Lesnar defeated Kurt Angle for the title.

At Crown Jewel on October 31, 2019, SmackDown wrestler &quot;The Fiend&quot; Bray Wyatt won the Universal Championship, thus transferring the title to SmackDown. Also at that event, after reigning WWE Champion Brock Lesnar had defeated Cain Velasquez to retain the title, he was attacked by Raw&#x27;s Rey Mysterio, who Lesnar had attacked a few weeks prior. The following night on &quot;Friday Night SmackDown&quot;, Lesnar quit SmackDown and went to Raw to continue his feud with Mysterio, thus transferring the WWE Championship to Raw.

==== Universal Championship relationship ====

At WrestleMania 38 Night 2 on April 3, 2022, SmackDown&#x27;s Universal Champion Roman Reigns defeated reigning WWE Champion Brock Lesnar in a Winner Takes All match to claim both world championships and then become recognized as the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion. WWE billed the match as a championship unification match and Reigns as a double champion, defending both titles together across both brands as the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. On the April 24, 2023, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, WWE Chief Content Officer Triple H announced that regardless of what brand Reigns was drafted to in the 2023 WWE Draft, he and his undisputed championship would become exclusive to that brand. Triple H subsequently unveiled a new World Heavyweight Championship for the opposing brand as the counterpart to Reigns&#x27; Undisputed Championship, which was won by Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins at Night of Champions. As Reigns was drafted to SmackDown, the World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to Raw. 

On the June 2, 2023, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, Triple H presented Reigns with a new singular championship belt to represent the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. Amidst confusion of the lineages, &quot;Fightful&quot; reported that WWE confirmed to them that the two championships are still in fact separate lineages, represented by one belt. This has also been represented on WWE.com, with both Reigns and Cody Rhodes, who defeated Reigns at WrestleMania XL, being shown as champions of both individual titles rather than the combined Undisputed WWE Universal Championship, which was shortened to Undisputed WWE Championship after Rhodes won the title.

== Brand designation ==
With the first brand split, an annual draft was established in 2002. Each year (except 2003), the General Managers participated in a draft lottery in which select members of WWE&#x27;s roster were assigned to a brand. The revived ECW became a third brand from 2006 to 2010. On August 29, 2011, WWE ended the brand extension and wrestlers (including all champions), were then free to appear on any program.

On July 19, 2016, &quot;SmackDown&quot; moved to Tuesdays and became a live show with its own set of wrestlers and writers, separate from &quot;Raw&quot;, thus reintroducing the brand split. The draft took place on the live premiere of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. On the July 18 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon named Daniel Bryan the SmackDown General Manager and Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon named Mick Foley the Raw General Manager.

Below is a list of dates indicating the transitions of the WWE Championship between the Raw, SmackDown, and ECW brands.

== Belt designs ==
=== 1963–1982 ===

When introduced in 1963, the original WWWF World Heavyweight Championship was represented by a United States championship belt that Buddy Rogers had defended in various territories prior to becoming the inaugural WWWF world champion. The center plate of this belt was an outline of the continental United States and there were two shield-shaped side plates with grapplers on them; the plates were on a red leather strap. On the center plate, there was a circle flanked by grapplers, and the circle was designed to contain a photograph of the titleholder. Above the circle was a shield with an eagle atop it with stars on opposite sides of the shield. The caption &quot;World&#x27;s Champion&quot; was added below the circle. This title belt was worn by the inaugural champion Buddy Rogers in 1963 and the second champion Bruno Sammartino.
After Sammartino became champion, a new title belt on a blue strap was created and used until 1965. The enlarged center piece contained a crowned globe and two grapplers, and read &quot;WWWF World Champion&quot;; the two side plates commemorated Sammartino&#x27;s title win. This belt was stolen in September 1965; a new belt was created with a mostly similar design with a couple of minor differences with the design of the side plates. This is the most recognizable version of Sammartino&#x27;s belt that was used until 1971 and has been called the &quot;holy grail of professional wrestling artifacts&quot;. After defeating Sammartino in January 1971, Ivan Koloff held Sammartino&#x27;s belt for three weeks before losing it to Pedro Morales.

During Morales&#x27;s reign, the championship belt was updated several times. First in 1971, this design was on an indigo colored strap and contained three shield-shaped plates. Below the center plate, which read &quot;World Heavyweight Champion&quot; and had a cross at its center, a separate horizontal plate read &quot;WWWF&quot;. This was replaced with another design in 1972. This version, on a red strap, read &quot;WWWF Heavyweight Wrestling Champion&quot; around the edges with an eagle at the center, while six side plates represented several countries. 1973 saw the introduction of another yet similar design; this one was on a black strap and contained two grapplers above a differently designed eagle. This version was subsequently held by Stan Stasiak, Bruno Sammartino, &quot;Superstar&quot; Billy Graham – who wore a red leather variation – and Bob Backlund. During the latter&#x27;s reign, the promotion&#x27;s name was shortened to World Wrestling Federation (WWF), but the physical championship belt still read &quot;WWWF&quot;.

=== 1982–2005 ===

After the previous design was destroyed, a new design was introduced in January 1983, nicknamed the &quot;Big Green Belt&quot; due to its size and the color of its strap. This was the first to be created under the WWF name. It included eight (later ten) side plates dedicated to the previous champions. The center plate featured a wrestler holding up a championship belt with a globe behind him. This design, held by Bob Backlund, The Iron Sheik, and Hulk Hogan, was replaced first by the &quot;Hogan &#x27;84&quot; design during the spring of 1984, then by the nearly identical &quot;Hogan &#x27;85&quot; design, which first appeared at WrestleMania 1. Both were called &quot;Hogan&quot; belts as they were only worn by Hulk Hogan, and they were similar in design to the NWA Television Championship at the time. The &#x27;84 belt consisted of a dual-plated gold and silver main plate as well as two dual-plated side plates on each side. The main plate was engraved with red lettering. The &#x27;85 belt had a silver and black main plate with raised silver lettering and the same side plates as the &#x27;84 belt. Both belts included black straps. Both center plates read &quot;WWF&quot; at the top, below that was an eagle with two banners below it reading &quot;World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion&quot;. The bottom read &quot;World Wrestling Federation&quot; and above that was a name plate commemorating Hogan&#x27;s title win, while the side plates noted previous champions. In October 1985, a new belt was introduced and was again only worn by Hogan. This belt is erroneously known as the &quot;Hogan &#x27;86&quot; belt. The center plate featured a globe in the center, along with Roman columns and olive branches. It read &quot;World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion&quot; and included the famous WWF block logo at the top, while four side plates had flags (two flags per side plate) representing the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, Australia, the Soviet Union, and Italy.

On February 5, 1988, just before ending his first championship reign, Hogan introduced another new design, the &quot;Winged Eagle&quot; championship belt, which became the primary design for the next decade with many wrestlers holding this version, and is considered the most popular design of the championship. Its nickname is derived from the eagle&#x27;s wings seemingly coming off of the center plate, which included the block WWF logo and read &quot;World Heavyweight Wrestling Champion&quot;. The championship belt also had four identical side plates. Apart from the usual black leather strap, The Ultimate Warrior wore white, light blue, yellow, and purple variations, with the latter also worn by Sgt. Slaughter. In March 1998, after &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin became champion, he was presented with a new design, often dubbed the &quot;Big Eagle&quot; or &quot;Attitude Era&quot; championship belt. The center plate was similar to the previous design, but became fully rounded, and the side plates were updated with the inner side plates containing the McMahon family crest of a lion holding a shield that had the WWF logo. When it was unveiled, it originally contained the block WWF logo and was on a blue strap, but was updated in November 1998 to the WWF scratch logo and on a black strap. In addition to the logo, it read &quot;World Wrestling Federation Champion&quot;.

After Chris Jericho unified the WWF and World Championships into the Undisputed WWF Championship, the &quot;Big Eagle&quot; championship belt was used in tandem with the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot;, the former WCW Championship belt, until a single Undisputed Championship belt was introduced to champion Triple H on the April 1, 2002, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;. This new belt, dubbed the &quot;Undisputed Championship Belt&quot;, was designed by New York-based tattoo artist Keith Ciaramello. Taking inspiration from WCW, this design included a name plate, and like the previous two designs, it had an eagle atop the globe. There were also stars seemingly shooting out from the globe. It originally had the WWF scratch logo and read &quot;World Wrestling Federation Champion&quot;; after the promotion was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002, both the scratch logo and wording were changed accordingly. The inner side plates on this design also contained the McMahon family crest of a lion holding a shield that had the company logo. The championship would drop the &quot;undisputed&quot; moniker in September 2002, becoming the WWE Championship again when it became exclusive to SmackDown, while the Big Gold Belt was resurrected to represent the World Heavyweight Championship for Raw.

=== 2005–2014 ===

After John Cena won the WWE Championship in April 2005, he introduced his own custom belt, the &quot;Spinner Belt&quot;, which had a gold and diamond bling-bling style reflecting his hip hop character at the time. Although originally a custom belt for Cena, it became the WWE Championship&#x27;s primary design from April 12, 2005, until February 18, 2013. The scratch WWE logo, placed between an eagle on top and the word &quot;Champ&quot; and a name plate below, could be spun like spinner wheels or a turntable in keeping with the hip-hop theme. The WWE logo was encrusted with diamonds while other parts of the championship were emblazoned with various other jewels. The inner side plates read &quot;WWE Champion&quot;, though before 2008, one side plate indicated the brand the title was designated to. The spinning function was phased out in later years and the logo set in a fixed place, most notably during The Miz&#x27;s first reign (2010–2011) when the logo was turned upside down to look like an &quot;M&quot;.

On the February 18, 2013, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, The Rock unveiled a new WWE Championship belt, often dubbed the &quot;Big Logo Belt&quot;. The new title was partially designed by Orange County Choppers of &quot;American Chopper&quot; fame, as well as well-known belt maker Dave Millican. The championship included a large cut-out of the scratch WWE logo (encrusted with diamonds) inside a large irregular heptagonal plate, with the border of the plate featuring diamonds and other gems. The backing behind the logo was the black leather strap itself with a nugget texture. The word &quot;Champion&quot; appeared in a large gold banner underneath the logo. Gold divider bars separated the center plate from its two large side plates. The side plates featured a removable center section that could be customized with the champion&#x27;s logo in lieu of a nameplate; the default side plates consisted of a red globe with the WWE logo on the globe underneath a crown.

After Randy Orton unified the WWE Championship and World Heavyweight Championship, with the latter being retired, the &quot;Big Logo Belt&quot; was used in tandem with the &quot;Big Gold Belt&quot; to represent the renamed WWE World Heavyweight Championship.

=== 2014–present ===
On the August 18, 2014, episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, reigning champion Brock Lesnar, who had won the title the night before at SummerSlam, was presented with a single championship belt, retiring the Big Gold Belt in the process. This new standard belt, often dubbed the &quot;Network Logo&quot; belt, had a slightly updated design from the belt introduced by The Rock in 2013 as a result of WWE changing their corporate logo to the one originally used for the WWE Network, which had launched earlier that year in February. It included a large center plate dominated by a cut out of the current WWE logo (encrusted with diamonds) inside an irregular heptagon with the capital words &quot;World Heavyweight Champion&quot; along the bottom edges, in very small print. The backing behind the logo was again the black leather strap with nugget texture. The belt retained the gold divider bars introduced in the previous design. The large side plates, like the previous design, included removable round center sections, allowing the holder&#x27;s personal logo to be added to the championship belt; the default plates showed gold and red world maps with the WWE logo over them but without the crown from the previous design. Customizable side plates have since become a prominent feature with the majority of WWE&#x27;s championship belts.

The &quot;Network Logo&quot; design would become a blueprint for WWE&#x27;s men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s world championships, with the only differences being the name at the bottom of the center plate and the colors, as well as the women&#x27;s being smaller. First was the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship in April 2016, which became the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship later that year, although it reverted to its original name in June 2023. After the WWE World Heavyweight Championship became exclusive to SmackDown as a result of the 2016 brand split, the design would also be used for the WWE Universal Championship that was introduced for the Raw brand. The design was also used for the SmackDown Women&#x27;s Championship introduced in August until that title received a new design in June 2023 when it was renamed Women&#x27;s World Championship. The NXT United Kingdom Championship and NXT UK Women&#x27;s Championship belts also used the same base outline but with a different design on the center plate itself. After the introduction of the Universal Championship, the WWE World Heavyweight Championship subsequently reverted to being called the WWE Championship, although from July to December 2016, it was called the &quot;WWE World Championship&quot;. The physical belt retained the text &quot;World Heavyweight Champion&quot;.

After Roman Reigns became the Undisputed WWE Universal Champion at WrestleMania 38 in April 2022, both the standard versions of the WWE Championship and Universal Championship belts were used in tandem to represent the undisputed title, although both titles retained their individual lineages. On the June 2, 2023, episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;, in celebration of Reigns reaching 1,000 days as Universal Champion, he was presented with a new single title belt to represent the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship. It features the same &quot;Network Logo&quot; design on a black strap, but the WWE logo is encrusted with black diamonds, it has a gold nugget-textured background behind the logo which was made as part of the metal plate instead of colored leather, and the text at the bottom of the plate says &quot;Undisputed Champion&quot;; the side plates remained the same. Despite this, his manager Paul Heyman had continued to carry around the previous WWE and Universal Championship belts until the end of July. On WWE&#x27;s website, pictures of the previous title belts were still used for the individual title histories of each championship until April 2024 when the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship (subsequently referred to as the Undisputed WWE Championship) belt replaced the image for the WWE Championship; the Universal Championship title history remains a picture of the previous blue belt.

During &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; on December 14, 2024–as part of the show&#x27;s 1980s throwback theme—reigning champion Cody Rhodes wore the &quot;Winged Eagle&quot; belt to represent his Undisputed WWE Championship. Following the controversial finish where Rhodes hit Kevin Owens with his Cross Rhodes finishing move on a steel chair to win the match, Owens would after the match hit Rhodes with a piledriver (a move banned in WWE) and steal the &quot;Winged Eagle&quot; belt, proclaiming himself the &quot;true champion&quot;.

=== Customization ===

Custom championship belts have been created to honor certain reigning champions or match their characters. During Hogan&#x27;s reign in 1986, he had a modified version of the Hogan &#x27;86 made, which included a picture of himself at the center. Not much is known about this &quot;mystery belt&quot; as he quickly reverted to the Hogan &#x27;86 version. A much larger version similar to the Hogan &#x27;86 championship belt was created for André the Giant before WrestleMania III, although he never wore it as champion.

A custom championship belt was used by &quot;Stone Cold&quot; Steve Austin during his second reign (1998), which included his &quot;Smoking Skull&quot; logo as well as rattle snakes. As an answer, The Rock also had a custom championship belt designed and constructed, including his trademark &quot;Brahma Bull&quot; logo, but due to creative reasons, it never appeared on television. The Spinner Belt, originally a customized belt for John Cena, remained the standard title belt from 2005 to 2013. During Edge&#x27;s second reign in 2006, he introduced his own variation, the &quot;Rated R Spinner&quot; design, replacing the WWE scratch logo with his &quot;Rated R Superstar&quot; logo. Edge had sketched a completely new custom design, but due to creative differences, it did not get made. Edge, who was not a fan of his spinner version and wanted a custom design that meant something, later said that WWE probably decided to go with the Rated R Spinner version in order to sell more merchandise. During Daniel Bryan&#x27;s fourth reign (2018–2019) as part of his environmentalist heel gimmick, he threw the standard title belt in a garbage can (bemoaning the fact it was made from leather) and introduced a new custom belt, dubbed the &quot;Planet&#x27;s Championship&quot;, featuring the same design as the &quot;Network Logo&quot; belt, but made from &quot;entirely sustainable materials&quot; (such as the strap being made from hemp and the center and side plates carved from wood of a naturally fallen oak tree; the side plates also had his name instead of the WWE logo).

===In other sports===
In October 2014, WWE presented the San Francisco Giants a replica of the &quot;Network Logo&quot; belt for winning the 2014 World Series. This began a tradition for WWE, and they have since created custom WWE Championship belts for winners in professional sports, with the side plates commemorating the achievement. They have also presented a custom belt to exceptionally notable people for their efforts in their profession. WWE had originally presented custom WWE Championships to winners in both male and female sports, but in 2018, they began presenting those in female sports with custom Women&#x27;s Championship belts.

Since that original gift in 2014, WWE has presented custom WWE Championship belts to winners of the World Series, Super Bowl, NBA Finals, FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, College Football Playoff National Championship, Stanley Cup Finals, Australian Open, Premier League, Bundesliga, Indian Premier League, Liga MX, Argentine Primera División, Major League Baseball Home Run Derby, Formula One World Championship, UEFA Champions League, Overwatch League, Cricket World Cup, Men&#x27;s US Open, and Canadian Football League Grey Cup. WWE also presented a title to London police officer Charlie Guenigault for his &quot;exceptional bravery&quot; during the 2017 London Bridge attack, and to the U.S. servicemen and women who have helped in hosting WWE Tribute to the Troops (since 2015) as well as for their continued service to the country. In 2020, WWE Championship belts were also presented to Christophe Agius and Philippe Chéreau, WWE announcers in France for 20 consecutive years presenting WWE on French television. With the introduction of the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship belt in June 2023, WWE have since presented custom versions of it. 

In 2021, and 2023 respectively, WWE announced their dual partnership with the NBA and NFL to bring custom WWE Legacy Championship Belts to winners of their respective championship games.

== Reigns ==
The WWE Championship was the first world championship introduced into the promotion in 1963. The inaugural champion was Buddy Rogers, and there have been 55 different official champions overall and 11 vacancies. The longest reigning champion is Bruno Sammartino, who held the title from May 17, 1963, to January 18, 1971, for a total of 2,803 days (7 years, 8 months, and 1 day); Sammartino also holds the record for longest combined reign at 4,040 days. André the Giant is the shortest reigning champion, officially holding the title for 1 minute, 48 seconds due to selling the title to Ted DiBiase following his title win. The youngest champion is Brock Lesnar, who won the title for the first time at the age of 25 years, 44 days during SummerSlam 2002 in August 2002, while the oldest champion is Mr. McMahon, who won the title for the first and only time at the age of 54 years, 21 days during the September 16, 1999 episode of &quot;SmackDown&quot;. John Cena holds the record for most reigns with 13 which occurred between 2005 and 2017.

Cody Rhodes is the current champion in his first reign. He won the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship (WWE and Universal Championships) by defeating Roman Reigns in a Bloodline Rules match at WrestleMania XL Night 2 on April 7, 2024, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Following his win, the undisputed title&#x27;s name was truncated to Undisputed WWE Championship.

<text>Howard William Morenz (September 21, 1902 – March 8, 1937) was a Canadian professional ice hockey player. Beginning in 1923, he played centre for three National Hockey League (NHL) teams: the Montreal Canadiens (in two stints), the Chicago Black Hawks, and the New York Rangers. Before joining the NHL, Morenz excelled in the junior Ontario Hockey Association, where his team played for the Memorial Cup, the championship for junior ice hockey in Canada. In the NHL, he was one of the most dominant players in the league and set several league scoring records. A strong skater, Morenz was referred to as the &quot;Stratford Streak&quot; and &quot;Mitchell Meteor&quot; in reference to his speed on the ice.

Considered one of the first stars of the NHL, Morenz played 14 seasons in the league. He was a member of a Stanley Cup–winning team three times, all with the Canadiens. During his NHL career he placed in the top 10 leading scorers ten times. For seven straight seasons, Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals scored and points. He was named the winner of the Hart Trophy as the most valuable player of the league three times, and he led the league once in goals scored and twice in points scored. After the introduction of All-Star teams in 1931, he was named to the NHL first All-Star team twice and the NHL second All-Star team once.

Morenz died from complications of a broken leg, an injury he suffered in a game. After his death, the Canadiens retired his jersey number, the first time the team had done so for any player. When the Hockey Hall of Fame opened in 1945, Morenz was one of the original nine inductees. In 1950, the Canadian Press named him the best ice hockey player of the first half of the 20th century, and in 2017 the NHL included him on their list of the 100 greatest players in league history.

==Personal life==
Born in Mitchell, Ontario to William Frederick Morenz and Rosena (Rose) Pauli, Howie Morenz had three sisters, Freda, Erma and Gertrude, and two brothers, Wilfred and Ezra. Morenz learned his hockey by playing shinny on the Thames River. At the age of eight, he played his first organized game as a goaltender, where he allowed 21 goals in a game. After that game, a coach switched Morenz to rover. Starting the 1916–17 junior season as a goaltender, Morenz became a forward when it became apparent his speed was much more suitable for an offensive role, and he helped the Mitchell ice hockey team win the Western Ontario junior championship. After the Morenz family moved to the nearby community of Stratford in May 1917, Morenz tried enlisting in the Canadian military but was refused when recruiters learned he was only 15 years old.

At the age of 18, Morenz became an apprentice with the Canadian National Railways (CNR) factory in Stratford. When not playing hockey, Morenz bet avidly on horse races and played the ukulele. In 1926 he married Mary McKay; together, they had three children: Howie Jr. in 1927 (d. 2015), Donald in 1933 (d. 1939), and Marlene in 1934 (d. March 2, 2018). Marlene later married Bernie Geoffrion, who played for both the Canadiens and Rangers from 1950 to 1968. Their son, Morenz&#x27;s grandson Dan, played for the Canadiens in 1979–80. Dan&#x27;s son, Blake, played with the University of Wisconsin and won the Hobey Baker Award as best collegiate player in 2010. Selected in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Nashville Predators, he made his debut with the Predators in 2011, becoming the first fourth-generation NHL player. Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012, meaning that all four generations of the Morenz-Geoffrion family have played within the Canadiens organization.

==Playing career==
===Early career===
In 1920 Morenz joined the Stratford Midgets junior team (under 20 years old), leading the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) in assists and points during the 1920–21 regular season, and goals, assists and points in the playoffs. The Midgets won the league title and played in the 1921 Memorial Cup against the Winnipeg Falcons. While Morenz scored a hat trick (three goals) in the second game in the series, the Midgets lost the total-goals series 11–9. His performance in the Memorial Cup tournament earned him an invitation to play for the Stratford Indians, a senior league team, for the 1921–22 season. While he joined the Indians, he continued to play for the juniors as well. During the playoffs, he led both leagues in goals, assists, and points and he also led the senior league in penalty minutes. Playing exclusively in the senior league in the 1922–23 season, he led it in regular season assists, playoff goals, points, and penalty minutes.
During a CNR hockey tournament held in December 1922 in Montreal, Morenz scored nine goals in a game for Stratford. A friend of Léo Dandurand, the owner of the Montreal Canadiens of the National Hockey League, refereed the game and told Dandurand how good Morenz was. Dandurand went to Stratford in January 1923 to watch Morenz play, and decided he wanted to sign him to the Canadiens. In April he met with William Morenz, because at the age of 20, Howie was still legally a minor. William told Dandurand that he wanted Howie to finish his apprenticeship at the CNR factory, which would take another two years. However, in July Dandurand learned that Morenz and his father had been in contact with the Toronto St. Patricks, a rival team in the NHL. Fearing that Morenz would sign in Toronto, Dandurand sent his friend, Cecil Hart, to Stratford with instructions to sign Morenz at any cost. On July 7, 1923, Morenz signed a contract with the Canadiens for three years with a salary of $3,500 per year and a $1,000 signing bonus, a considerable amount for a first-year professional.

Right after signing the contract with the Canadiens, Morenz began to reconsider joining them. Stratford residents, as well as his senior team, wanted him to stay, and Morenz yielded to the pressure. He wrote a letter in August to Dandurand, explaining that he could not leave Stratford, and included the cheque given to him as a signing bonus. After receiving the letter, Dandurand phoned Morenz and told him to come to Montreal to talk in person. In Montreal, Morenz began explaining his reasons for not signing to Dandurand but began crying and could not finish. In response, Dandurand falsely threatened that if Morenz did not join the Canadiens, his professional hockey career would be over. Hearing this, Morenz relented and agreed to report to the Canadiens&#x27; training camp later in the year.

===Montreal Canadiens (1923–34)===
On December 3, 1923, Morenz arrived at his first Canadiens training camp and quickly impressed his new teammates. He made his NHL debut on December 26, 1923, in Ottawa against the Ottawa Senators, scoring a goal. At the conclusion of the 1923–24 season, Morenz&#x27;s first in the NHL, he finished with 13 goals and 3 assists in 24 games. Finishing first in the league for the first time in five years, the Canadiens faced the Senators in the playoffs for the NHL championship. In the first game of the two-game, total-goals series, Morenz scored the only goal, and added another goal in the second game as the Canadiens won the series, five goals to two. As the champions of the NHL, the Canadiens played two teams from Western Canada for the Stanley Cup. They defeated the Vancouver Maroons of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) in two games of a best-of-three series and then faced the Calgary Tigers of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL). In the first game against Calgary, Morenz scored a hat trick as the Canadiens won by a score of 6–1. He scored another goal in the second game, as Montreal defeated the Tigers 3–0 to win their second Stanley Cup championship and Morenz&#x27;s first with the team.
The following season, Morenz scored 28 goals and had 11 assists for 39 points, placing second on the Canadiens and fourth in the NHL in scoring. That was followed with seven goals and eight points in six playoff games, as Montreal lost in the Stanley Cup Finals to the Victoria Cougars of the WCHL. Morenz tied with linemate Aurèle Joliat in leading the Canadiens in scoring in 1925–26 with 26 points, finishing fifth in the league. In 1926–27 he finished third in the league in goals, with 25, and points, with 32, to again lead the Canadiens. The one goal he scored in four playoff games was a series winner in the quarter-finals, eliminating the Montreal Maroons from postseason contention.

The 1927–28 season was one of Morenz&#x27;s best in the NHL. On March 24, 1928, in the final game of the regular season, Morenz earned two assists, tying the then-NHL record for assists in a season with 18 and becoming the first player to reach 50 points in a season, finishing with 51. As the league leader in goals, with 33, assists and points, Morenz was named the recipient of the Hart Trophy as the league&#x27;s most valuable player. Though his scoring totals went down in 1928–29, with 17 goals and 27 points, Morenz still led the Canadiens in scoring, and tied for third overall in the league.

In 1929–30 Morenz finished seventh in the league for scoring with 50 points, including scoring 40 goals for the first time; this included a game against the New York Americans on March 18, 1930, in which he scored five goals. In the playoffs, he added another three goals, including his second Stanley Cup-winning goal, as the Canadiens beat the Boston Bruins for their third Stanley Cup. In the 1930–31 season, Morenz scored 28 goals and matched his career high with 51 points, winning his second NHL scoring title, and being awarded the Hart Trophy for the second time. He was also named to the newly created NHL All-Star team, being selected as the first-team centre, as the top player in that position. In the playoffs, the Canadiens reached the Stanley Cup Finals for the second consecutive year, playing the Chicago Black Hawks. Playing with an injured shoulder and being held back by the Black Hawks, Morenz only scored one goal throughout ten playoff games, the final goal of the playoffs, as he won his third Stanley Cup with the Canadiens.

The 1931–32 season was another productive season for Morenz. With 49 points he finished third in league scoring, and became the first player in NHL history to win the Hart Trophy for a third time, also being named to the first All-Star team again. In a March 17, 1932, game against the New York Americans, Morenz scored his 334th point with an assist, passing Cy Denneny as the NHL record holder for career points. Minor injuries led to Morenz&#x27;s point totals going down the following season as he finished second on the Canadiens in scoring behind Joliat, the first time in seven years he did not lead the Canadiens, ending up 10th in the league with 35 points. In the playoffs, he had three assists in two games. The 1933–34 season also saw Morenz&#x27;s goal and point totals fall, to 8 goals and 21 points. Even with his decline in scoring, he still managed to reach a significant milestone, once again passing Cy Denneny to do so. Against the Detroit Red Wings on December 23, 1933, he scored his 249th career goal, to become the NHL leader for career goals. On January 2, 1934, Morenz twisted his ankle in a game in New York, bruising the bone and tearing ligaments. It was the first serious injury of his career, and he was unable to play for a month. After returning to the team, Morenz was unable to play at his previous level, and the Canadiens&#x27; fans began booing him.

With the decline in production, reports of the Canadiens wanting to trade Morenz began appearing in Montreal newspapers. When the Canadiens began their playoff series against the Chicago Black Hawks, the Canadiens&#x27; general manager, Léo Dandurand, confirmed that several teams wanted to acquire Morenz. After playing the first game with his usual speed and skill, Morenz broke his thumb in the second game, finishing with a goal and an assist for the playoffs.

After the playoffs, Morenz addressed the trade rumours, telling a reporter that he would only play for the Canadiens, saying that &quot;when I can&#x27;t play for them, I&#x27;ll never put on a skate again,&quot; though the Canadiens&#x27; management knew he was too passionate about hockey to quit. During the summer of 1934, Morenz became concerned about his future with the team. Newspapers continued to write that Morenz would be involved in a trade involving several players and teams. Adding to Morenz&#x27;s concern was the lack of response from either of the Canadiens&#x27; owners, Léo Dandurand or Joe Cattarinich, informing him of what was happening. The rumours ended on October 3, 1934, when Morenz was traded along with goaltender Lorne Chabot and defenceman Marty Burke, to the Chicago Black Hawks for forwards Leroy Goldsworthy and Lionel Conacher, and defenceman Roger Jenkins.

===Chicago, New York and Montreal (1934–37)===

In his first season with the Black Hawks, 1934–35, Morenz played in all 48 games for the team, scoring 8 goals and 34 points, an improvement over the previous season. The Black Hawks reached the playoffs, though Morenz was held pointless in the two games played. The following season was not as good for Morenz. He did not feel comfortable in Chicago, and was being benched, playing fewer minutes than he was used to. After 23 games with the Black Hawks, in which he scored 15 points, Morenz was traded for the second time in his career; he was sent to the New York Rangers on January 26, 1936, for forward Glen Brydson. Playing 19 games for the Rangers, Morenz scored 2 goals and had another 4 assists for 6 points, giving him 21 points over the season.

Over the summer of 1936, the Canadiens re-hired Cecil Hart to be the coach of the team. Hart agreed to the job on one condition: that the Canadiens bring Morenz back to the team. On September 1, 1936, Morenz once again joined the Canadiens, his contract being purchased by the team from the Rangers. The Canadiens spent most of the 1936–37 season as one of the best teams in the NHL; Morenz contributed regularly, occasionally showing the speed that had made him notable at the start of his career. By mid-January, he had 4 goals and 20 points, far better totals than previous years.

====Final game and death====
The Canadiens played the Chicago Black Hawks in Montreal on January 28, 1937. In the first period, Morenz went after the puck in the Chicago end while being chased by Black Hawks defenceman Earl Seibert. Morenz lost his balance and fell to the ice, crashing into the boards and catching his left skate in the wooden siding. Seibert, unable to stop, landed on him with full force. The resulting impact snapped Morenz&#x27;s left leg, creating a noise heard throughout the rink. Helped to the Canadiens bench by his teammates, Morenz was taken to Hôpital St-Luc, where it was found that his leg was fractured in four places. Hart was initially hopeful that Morenz could return after six weeks, but after learning of the severity of the injury conceded that Morenz would not be able to play the rest of the season.
While recovering in the hospital, Morenz received many get-well cards and visits from his teammates and players from other NHL teams. There were so many of them who brought drinks that a teammate remarked that &quot;the whisky was on the dresser and the beer was under the bed.&quot; Though there were many visitors, Morenz often found himself alone in the hospital room, unable to move off his bed. To pass the time, he read newspapers to stay up to date with the Canadiens as they finished the season. Since his injury, the team had dropped in the standings, causing Morenz to worry. He began to think he would never play hockey again and became depressed.

The Canadiens&#x27; team doctor, Dr. J.A. Hector Forgues, visited Morenz in late February and determined that he had suffered a nervous breakdown. To help Morenz, Dr. Forgues banned all visitors to his room, except for family and Canadiens officials. Mary, Morenz&#x27;s wife, and their oldest son, Howie Jr., visited on most days, and William Morenz, his father, travelled from Stratford during the first week of March and stayed through March 5. On March 8, Morenz began complaining of chest pains, which doctors attributed to a heart attack. Mary Morenz and Cecil Hart were called to the hospital; around 11:30 pm, Morenz tried to get out of bed to use the washroom but collapsed on the floor and died from a coronary embolism caused by blood clots from his damaged leg, minutes before his wife and coach arrived. He was 34.

The Canadiens were scheduled to play the Montreal Maroons the evening of March 9, a game the NHL offered to cancel in honour of Morenz&#x27;s death. However Mary insisted the game be played, saying that Morenz would have wanted the game to continue. The players on the Canadiens and Maroons wore black armbands for the game, and prior to the start, two minutes of silence were observed in his honour. A similar event happened in New York, where the New York Rangers and New York Americans had a moment of silence before the start of their game.

A funeral was held on March 11, at the Montreal Forum, the arena where the Canadiens played. Fans were allowed to file past the casket, laid at centre ice, and 50,000 people paid their respects. A rotating guard of honour of four Canadiens stood around the casket which was covered in flowers including a large wreath from Aurèle Joliat that was shaped like the number 7, Morenz&#x27;s number, and a note from Morenz&#x27;s three children. The entire service was broadcast on the radio, and after its conclusion he was buried in Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal.

==Legacy==
The city of Montreal mourned the death of Morenz for months. To honour him, the Canadiens retired his jersey number, 7, on November 2, 1937, the first time the team honoured a player in that fashion. This was prior to a benefit all-star game held at the Forum to raise money for the Morenz family. A team composed of players from the Canadiens and Maroons was defeated 6–5 by a team of players from the other NHL teams.

One of the most skilled players in the early NHL, Morenz led the Canadiens in both goals and points from 1926 until 1932, though he tied with Aurèle Joliat for points in 1926. At the time of his death, he had set an NHL record for most career points with 472. When the Hockey Hall of Fame was established in 1945, he was among the first group of nine inductees. A 1950 Canadian Press poll named Morenz the best ice hockey player of the first half of the 20th century. In 1998 he was ranked 15th on &quot;The Hockey News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players. When the NHL announced its 100 greatest players in conjunction with the league&#x27;s centennial in 2017, Morenz was included on the list.

Through his exciting play, Morenz encouraged the expansion of the NHL, helping bring professional hockey to the United States. Watching Morenz play during the 1924 Stanley Cup Finals between Montreal and Calgary, Morenz&#x27;s first season in the NHL, Charles Adams, the owner of a chain of grocery stores, went back to Boston wanting a hockey team based in the city. That summer, the NHL granted Adams a franchise for the following season, the Boston Bruins. Boxing promoter Tex Rickard, owner of Madison Square Garden, also saw Morenz play early in his career and agreed to add ice to his building for an NHL team known as the New York Americans. As part of the agreement, Morenz and the Canadiens played the first game against the Americans on December 15, 1925.

Morenz&#x27;s daughter Marlene married Bernie Geoffrion, who also played for the Canadiens and Rangers, and was later inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. When the Canadiens retired Geoffrion&#x27;s number on the night of his death on March 11, 2006, the team recognized the link between the two men. As Geoffrion&#x27;s banner was being raised to the rafters, Morenz&#x27;s banner was lowered halfway to the ice. Once Geoffrion&#x27;s banner reached Morenz&#x27; banner, the two were raised together.

<text>Charlottenberg is a locality in Värmland County, Sweden, and the administrative centre of Eda Municipality.

Situated some seven kilometres from the Norwegian border, the town has a population of around 3,000. Charlottenberg railway station is the last in Sweden before the Norwegian border, and serves as the frontier point between the Swedish and Norwegian railway systems. The town lies on Swedish national road (&quot;riksväg&quot;) 61, which becomes Norwegian national road (&quot;riksvei&quot;) 2 at the border. Nearby towns include Åmotfors (14 km) and Arvika (30 km) in Sweden, Magnor (9 km), Skotterud (14 km), and Kongsvinger (38 km) in Norway.

As a border town, Charlottenberg benefits greatly from the &quot;border trade&quot; encouraged by the difference in retail prices between Norway and Sweden. Alcohol, meat, and confectionery are sold in large quantities. The influx of Norwegian shoppers is so great in the period leading up to Christmas that many Charlottenberg locals prefer to do their own shopping in other towns at this time of year.

As well as retailing, Charlottenberg&#x27;s economic activities include the manufacture of cast aluminium components for the transport industry.

<doc id="630478" wikidata="Q6029713" url="?curid=630478" title="Infinitary logic">
<text>An infinitary logic is a logic that allows infinitely long statements and/or infinitely long proofs. The concept was introduced by Zermelo in the 1930s.

Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard first-order logic. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be compact or complete. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in finitary logic sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and strong completeness are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.

Considering whether a certain infinitary logic named Ω-logic is complete promises to throw light on the continuum hypothesis.

==A word on notation and the axiom of choice==
As a language with infinitely long formulae is being presented, it is not possible to write such formulae down explicitly. To get around this problem a number of notational conveniences, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the formal language, are used. formula_1 is used to point out an expression that is infinitely long. Where it is unclear, the length of the sequence is noted afterwards. Where this notation becomes ambiguous or confusing, suffixes such as formula_2 are used to indicate an infinite disjunction over a set of formulae of cardinality formula_3. The same notation may be applied to quantifiers, for example formula_4. This is meant to represent an infinite sequence of quantifiers: a quantifier for each formula_5 where formula_6.

All usage of suffixes and formula_1 are not part of formal infinitary languages.

The axiom of choice is assumed (as is often done when discussing infinitary logic) as this is necessary to have sensible distributivity laws.

==Formal languages==

A first-order infinitary language formula_8, formula_9 regular, formula_10 or formula_11, has the same set of symbols as a finitary logic and may use all the rules for formation of formulae of a finitary logic together with some additional ones:
*Given a set of formulae formula_12 with formula_13 then formula_14 and formula_15 are formulae. (In each case the sequence has length formula_3.)
*Given a set of variables formula_17 with formula_18 and a formula formula_19 then formula_20 and formula_21 are formulae. (In each case the sequence of quantifiers has length formula_3.)

The language may also have function, relation, and predicate symbols of finite arity. Karp also defined languages formula_23 with formula_24 an infinite cardinal and some more complicated restrictions on formula_25 that allow for function and predicate symbols of infinite arity, with formula_25 controlling the maximum arity of a function symbol and formula_27 controlling predicate symbols.

The concepts of free and bound variables apply in the same manner to infinite formulae. Just as in finitary logic, a formula all of whose variables are bound is referred to as a &quot;sentence&quot;.

==Definition of Hilbert-type infinitary logics==

A theory formula_28 in infinitary language formula_29 is a set of sentences in the logic. A proof in infinitary logic from a theory formula_28 is a (possibly infinite) sequence of statements that obeys the following conditions: Each statement is either a logical axiom, an element of formula_28, or is deduced from previous statements using a rule of inference. As before, all rules of inference in finitary logic can be used, together with an additional one:

*Given a set of statements formula_12 that have occurred previously in the proof then the statement formula_33 can be inferred.

If formula_34, forming universal closures may not always be possible, however extra constant symbols may be added for each variable with the resulting satisfiability relation remaining the same. To avoid this, some authors use a different definition of the language formula_35 forbidding formulas from having more than formula_36 free variables.

The logical axiom schemata specific to infinitary logic are presented below. Global schemata variables: formula_3 and formula_38 such that formula_39.
*formula_40
*For each formula_6, formula_42
*Chang&#x27;s distributivity laws (for each formula_38): formula_44, where formula_45 or formula_46, and formula_47
*For formula_48, formula_49, where formula_50 is a well ordering of formula_51
The last two axiom schemata require the axiom of choice because certain sets must be well orderable. The last axiom schema is strictly speaking unnecessary, as Chang&#x27;s distributivity laws imply it, however it is included as a natural way to allow natural weakenings to the logic.

==Completeness, compactness, and strong completeness==
A theory is any set of sentences. The truth of statements in models are defined by recursion and will agree with the definition for finitary logic where both are defined. Given a theory &quot;T&quot; a sentence is said to be valid for the theory &quot;T&quot; if it is true in all models of &quot;T&quot;.

A logic in the language formula_29 is complete if for every sentence &quot;S&quot; valid in every model there exists a proof of &quot;S&quot;. It is strongly complete if for any theory &quot;T&quot; for every sentence &quot;S&quot; valid in &quot;T&quot; there is a proof of &quot;S&quot; from &quot;T&quot;. An infinitary logic can be complete without being strongly complete.

A cardinal formula_53 is weakly compact when for every theory &quot;T&quot; in formula_54 containing at most formula_9 many formulas, if every &quot;S&quot; formula_56 &quot;T&quot; of cardinality less than formula_9 has a model, then &quot;T&quot; has a model. A cardinal formula_53 is strongly compact when for every theory &quot;T&quot; in formula_54, without restriction on size, if every &quot;S&quot; formula_56 &quot;T&quot; of cardinality less than formula_9 has a model, then &quot;T&quot; has a model.

==Concepts expressible in infinitary logic==
In the language of set theory the following statement expresses foundation:

:formula_62

Unlike the axiom of foundation, this statement admits no non-standard interpretations. The concept of well-foundedness can only be expressed in a logic that allows infinitely many quantifiers in an individual statement. As a consequence many theories, including Peano arithmetic, which cannot be properly axiomatised in finitary logic, can be in a suitable infinitary logic. Other examples include the theories of non-archimedean fields and torsion-free groups. These three theories can be defined without the use of infinite quantification; only infinite junctions are needed.

Truth predicates for countable languages are definable in formula_63.

==Complete infinitary logics==
Two infinitary logics stand out in their completeness. These are the logics of formula_64 and formula_65. The former is standard finitary first-order logic and the latter is an infinitary logic that only allows statements of countable size.

The logic of formula_64 is also strongly complete, compact and strongly compact.

The logic of formula_67 fails to be compact, but it is complete (under the axioms given above). Moreover, it satisfies a variant of the Craig interpolation property.

If the logic of formula_68 is strongly complete (under the axioms given above) then formula_69 is strongly compact (because proofs in these logics cannot use formula_69 or more of the given axioms).

<text>A general anaesthetic (or anesthetic) is a drug that brings about a reversible loss of consciousness. These drugs are generally administered by an anaesthetist/anesthesiologist to induce or maintain general anaesthesia to facilitate surgery.

General anaesthetics have been widely used in surgery since 1842 when Crawford Long for the first time administered diethyl ether to a patient and performed a painless operation. It has long been believed that general anaesthetics exert their effects (analgesia, unconsciousness, immobility) through a membrane mediated mechanism or by directly modulating the activity of membrane proteins in the neuronal membrane. 
In general, different anaesthetics exhibit different mechanisms of action such that there are numerous non-exclusionary molecular targets at all levels of integration within the central nervous system.
However, for certain intravenous anaesthetics, such as propofol and etomidate, the main molecular target is believed to be GABAA receptor, with particular β subunits playing a crucial role.

The concept of specific interactions between receptors and drugs first introduced by Paul Ehrlich in 1897 states that drugs act only when they are bound to their targets (receptors). The identification of concrete molecular targets for general anaesthetics was made possible only with the modern development of molecular biology techniques for single amino acid mutations in proteins of genetically engineered mice.

== Lipid solubility-anaesthetic potency correlation (the Meyer-Overton correlation) ==

A nonspecific mechanism of general anaesthetic action was first proposed by Emil Harless and Ernst von Bibra in 1847.
They suggested that general anaesthetics may act by dissolving in the fatty fraction of brain cells and removing fatty constituents from them, thus changing activity of brain cells and inducing anaesthesia. In 1899 Hans Horst Meyer published the first experimental evidence of the fact that anaesthetic potency is related to lipid solubility. Two years later a similar theory was published independently by Charles Ernest Overton.

Meyer compared the potency of many agents, defined as the reciprocal of the molar concentration required to induce anaesthesia in tadpoles, with their olive oil/water partition coefficient. He found a nearly linear relationship between potency and the partition coefficient for many types of anaesthetic molecules such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, ethers, and esters.
The anaesthetic concentration required to induce anaesthesia in 50% of a population of animals (the EC50) was independent of the means by which the anaesthetic was delivered, i.e., the gas or aqueous phase.

Meyer and Overton had discovered the striking correlation between the physical properties of general anaesthetic molecules and their potency: the greater the lipid solubility of a compound in olive oil, the greater its anaesthetic potency. This correlation is true for a wide range of anaesthetics with lipid solubilities ranging over 4-5 orders of magnitude if olive oil is used as the oil phase. This correlation can be improved considerably in terms of both the quality of the correlation and the increased range of anaesthetics if bulk octanol or a fully hydrated fluid lipid bilayer is used as the &quot;oil&quot; phase. It was also noted that volatile anaesthetics are additive in their effects. (A mixture of a half dose of two different volatile anaesthetics gave the same anaesthetic effect as a full dose of either drug alone.)

The best characterized anesthetics site accounting for the Meyer-Overton correlation resides in ordered lipid domains. Anesthetics adhere non-specifically to the surface of a palmitate specific binding site within the lipid membrane, displacing the palmitate from ordered GM1 lipids. The process gives rise to a component of membrane-mediated anesthesia. A similar mechanism was shown for luciferase. The anesthetics bound non-specifically to a hydrophobic surface and out-competed the specific binding of luciferin. However luciferase is not physiologically relevant to vertebrates as it is not endogenously expressed in vertebrates.

== Early lipid hypotheses of general anaesthetic action ==

From the correlation between lipid solubility and anaesthetic potency, both Meyer and Overton had surmised a unitary mechanism of general anaesthesia. They assumed that solubilization of lipophilic general anaesthetic in lipid bilayer of the neuron causes its malfunction and anaesthetic effect when critical concentration of anaesthetic is reached. Later in 1973 Miller and Smith suggested the critical volume hypothesis also called lipid bilayer expansion hypothesis.
They assumed that bulky and hydrophobic anaesthetic molecules accumulate inside the hydrophobic (or lipophilic) regions of neuronal lipid membrane causing its distortion and expansion (thickening) due to volume displacement. Accumulation of critical amounts of anaesthetic causes membrane thickening sufficient to reversibly alter function of membrane ion channels thus providing anaesthetic effect. Actual chemical structure of the anaesthetic agent per se is not important, but its molecular volume plays the major role: the more space within membrane is occupied by anaesthetic - the greater is the anaesthetic effect.
Based on this theory, in 1954 Mullins suggested that the Meyer-Overton correlation with potency can be improved if molecular volumes of anaesthetic molecules are taken into account. This theory existed for over 60 years and was supported by experimental fact that increases in atmospheric pressure reverse anaesthetic effect (pressure reversal effect).

Then other, physicochemical theories of anaesthetic action emerged that took into account the diverse chemical nature of general anaesthetics and suggested that anaesthetic effect is exerted through some perturbation of the lipid bilayer. Several types of bilayer perturbations were proposed to cause anaesthetic effect, including (1) changes in phase separation, (2) changes in bilayer thickness, (3) changes in order parameters, or (4) changes in curvature elasticity.

According to the lateral phase separation theory anaesthetics exert their action by fluidizing nerve membranes to a point when phase separations in the critical lipid regions disappear. This anaesthetic-induced fluidization makes membranes less able to facilitate the conformational changes in proteins that may be the basis for such membrane events as ion gating, synaptic transmitter release, and transmitter binding to receptors. More recent techniques with super resolution imaging show that the anesthetics do not overcome phase separation—the phase separation persists. Rather saturated lipids within the phase separation can undergo a transition from ordered to disordered which is dramatically affected by anesthetics. Nonetheless the concept of proteins moving between phase separated lipids in response to anesthetic has now been shown to be correct.

All these early lipid theories were generally thought to suffer from four weaknesses (full description with rebuttals see in sections below):
* Stereoisomers of an anaesthetic drug have very different anaesthetic potency whereas their oil/gas partition coefficients are similar.
* Certain drugs that are highly soluble in lipids, therefore expected to act as anaesthetics, exert convulsive effect instead (and therefore were called nonimmobilizers).
* A small increase in body temperature affects membrane density and fluidity as much as general anaesthetics, yet it does not cause anaesthesia.
* Increasing the chain length in a homologous series of straight-chain alcohols or alkanes increases their lipid solubility, but their anaesthetic potency stops increasing beyond a certain cutoff length.

The correlation between lipid solubility and potency of general anaesthetics was thought to be a necessary but insufficient condition for inferring a lipid target site. General anaesthetics could equally well be binding to hydrophobic target sites on proteins in the brain, but given the chemical diversity of anesthetics this would likely need to include more than one site and those sites would not inherently preclude a site in the membrane. For proteins, one reason that more polar general anaesthetics could be less potent is that they have to cross the blood–brain barrier to exert their effect on neurons in the brain.

== Modern lipid hypothesis ==
There are two modern lipid hypotheses which are non-exclusionary with direct protein binding. The most recent hypothesis postulates that ordered lipids in the plasma membrane contain a structured binding site for the lipid palmitate. It is a lipid binding site within a lipid structure, not a protein structure. Proteins that contain a covalently attached palmitate (palmitoylation) are targeted to the ordered lipids through a specific lipid-lipid interaction. The binding of palmitate to the lipid domain is cholesterol dependent and the cell regulates the protein by nanoscopic localization.

Anesthetics work by binding non-specifically to the palmitate binding site, which disrupts the ability of the cholesterol to bind to and sequester the protein into an inactive state. This membrane mediated mechanism was demonstrated experimentally by Pavel and colleagues in 2020. They showed that the enzyme phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is anesthetic sensitive and activates the potassium channel TREK-1 through a membrane mediated mechanism. The anesthetics displaced PLD2 from ordered lipid domains, allowing the enzyme to be activated by substrate presentation and activate the channel.
The second lipid hypothesis states that anaesthetic effect happens if solubilization of general anaesthetic in the bilayer causes a redistribution of membrane lateral pressures.

Each bilayer membrane has a distinct profile of how lateral pressures are distributed within it. Most membrane proteins (especially ion channels) are sensitive to changes in this lateral pressure distribution profile. These lateral stresses are rather large and vary with depth within the membrane. According to the modern lipid hypothesis a change in the membrane lateral pressure profile shifts the conformational equilibrium of certain membrane proteins known to be affected by clinical concentrations of anaesthetics such as ligand-gated ion channels. This mechanism is also nonspecific because the potency of the anaesthetic is determined not by its actual chemical structure, but by the positional and orientational distribution of its segments and bonds within the bilayer.

In 1997, Cantor suggested a detailed mechanism of general anesthesia based on lattice statistical thermodynamics. It was proposed that incorporation of amphiphilic and other interfacially active solutes (e.g. general anaesthetics) into the bilayer increases the lateral pressure selectively near the aqueous interfaces, which is compensated by a decrease in lateral pressure toward the centre of the bilayer. Calculations showed that general anaesthesia likely involves inhibition of the opening of the ion channel in a postsynaptic ligand-gated membrane protein by the following mechanism:
* A channel tries to open in response to a nerve impulse, thus increasing the cross-sectional area of the protein more near the aqueous interface than in the middle of the bilayer;
* Then the anaesthetic-induced increase in lateral pressure near the interface shifts the protein conformational equilibrium back to the closed state, since channel opening will require greater work against the higher pressure at the interface.

This is the first hypothesis that provided not just correlations of potency with structural or thermodynamic properties, but a detailed mechanistic and thermodynamic understanding of anaesthesia.

Thus, according to the modern lipid hypothesis anaesthetics do not act directly on their membrane protein targets, but rather perturb specialized lipid matrices at the protein-lipid interface, which act as mediators. This is a new kind of transduction mechanism, different from the usual key-lock interaction of ligand and receptor, where the anaesthetic (ligand) affects the function of membrane proteins by binding to the specific site on the protein. Thus some membrane proteins are proposed to be sensitive to their lipid environment.

A slightly different detailed molecular mechanism of how bilayer perturbation can influence the ion channel was proposed in the same year. Oleamide (fatty acid amide of oleic acid) is an endogenous anaesthetic found in vivo (in the cat&#x27;s brain) and it is known to potentiate sleep and lower the temperature of the body by closing the gap junction channel connexion. The detailed mechanism is shown on the picture: the well-ordered lipid(green)/cholesterol(yellow) ring that exists around connexon (magenta) becomes disordered on treatment with anaesthetic (red triangles), promoting a closure of the connexon ion channel. This decreases brain activity and induces lethargy and anaesthetic effect.

Recently super resolution imaging showed direct experimental evidence that volatile anesthetics disrupt the ordered lipid domains as predicted. In the same study, a related mechanism emerged where the anesthetics released the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) from lipid domains and the enzyme bound to and activated TREK-1 channels by the production of phosphatidic acid. These results showed experimentally that the membrane is a physiologically relevant target of general anesthetics.

== Membrane protein hypothesis of general anaesthetic action ==

In the early 1980s, Nicholas P. Franks and William R. Lieb demonstrated that the Meyer-Overton correlation can be reproduced using a soluble protein. They found that two classes of proteins are inactivated by clinical doses of anaesthetic in the total absence of lipids. These are luciferases, which are used by bioluminescent animals and bacteria to produce light, and cytochrome P450, which is a group of heme proteins that hydroxylate a diverse group of compounds, including fatty acids, steroids, and xenobiotics such as phenobarbital. Remarkably, inhibition of these proteins by general anaesthetics was directly correlated with their anaesthetic potencies. Luciferase inhibition also exhibits a long-chain alcohol cutoff, which is related to the size of the anaesthetic-binding pocket.

These observations were important because they demonstrated that general anaesthetics exert their effect non-specifically including when binding to proteins. This also opened up the possibility that anesthetics could work through direct binding to proteins, rather than affect membrane proteins indirectly through nonspecific interactions with lipid bilayer as mediator. It was shown that anaesthetics alter the functions of many cytoplasmic signalling proteins, including protein kinase C.

However, the proteins considered the most likely molecular targets of anaesthetics are ion channels. According to this theory general anaesthetics are much more selective than in the lipid hypotheses, and they bind directly only to a small number of targets in the central nervous system, mostly ligand-gated ion channels in synapses and G-protein coupled receptors, altering their ion flux. Particularly Cys-loop receptors are plausible targets for general anaesthetics that bind at the interface between the subunits. The Cys-loop receptor superfamily includes inhibitory receptors (GABAA receptors, GABAC receptors, glycine receptors) and excitatory receptors (nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and 5-HT3 serotonin receptor). General anaesthetics can inhibit the channel functions of excitatory receptors or potentiate functions of inhibitory receptors, respectively.

The location of non-specific binding sites in ion channels is still a major question in the field. In particular, how does a compound that follows Overton-Meyer directly cause a conformational change in the protein? Typically, allosteric regulation involves a change in protein shape that accommodates the binding of the ligand. This mechanism is distinct from the luciferase mechanism. A second important question, how are the non-specific protein binding sites conserved across species and why do they generally inhibit excitatory receptors and potentiate inhibitory receptors? 
A number of experimental and computational studies have shown that general anaesthetics could alter the dynamics in the flexible loops that connect α-helices in a bundle and are exposed to the membrane-water interface of Cys-loop receptors. The main binding pockets of general anaesthetics, however, are located within transmembrane four-α-helix bundles of Cys-loop receptors.

==GABAA receptor is a major target of general anesthetics==
The GABAA receptor (GABAAR) is an ionotropic receptor activated by the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). 
Activation of the GABAA receptor leads to an influx of chloride ions, which causes hyperpolarization of the neuronal membranes.

The GABAA receptor has been identified as the main target of intravenous anesthetics such as propofol and etomidate.
The binding site of propofol on mammalian GABAA receptors has been identified by photolabeling using a diazirine derivative. Strong activation of tonic GABAA receptor conductance by clinical concentrations of propofol has been confirmed with electrophysiological recordings from hippocampal CA1 neurons in adult rat brain slices.

GABAA receptors that contain β3-subunits are the main molecular targets for the anesthetic actions of etomidate, whereas the β2-containing GABAA receptors are involved in the sedation elicited by this drug.
Electrophysiological experiments with amnestic concentrations of etomidate have also shown enhancement of tonic GABAA conductance of CA1 pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices.

Potent activation of GABAA receptor-mediated inhibition with resulting strong depression of firing rates of neocortical neurons has also been demonstrated for clinical concentrations of volatile anesthetics such as isoflurane, enflurane and halothane.

== Other molecular targets ==

The enhancement of GABAA receptor activity is unlikely to be the only mechanism to account for the wide range of behavioural effects of general anaesthetics. Accumulating experimental data suggests that modulation of two-pore domain potassium channels, or voltage-gated sodium channels may also account for some of the actions of volatile anaesthetic agents. Alternatively, inhibition of glutamate-gated N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors by ketamine, xenon, and nitrous oxide provides a mechanism of action in keeping with a predominant analgesic profile.

== Historical objections to the early lipid hypotheses ==

=== 1. Stereoisomers of an anaesthetic drug ===

Stereoisomers that represent mirror images of each other are termed enantiomers or optical isomers (for example, the isomers of R-(+)- and S-(−)-etomidate).
Physicochemical effects of enantiomers are always identical in an achiral environment (for example in the lipid bilayer). However, in vivo enantiomers of many general anaesthetics (e.g. isoflurane, thiopental, etomidate) can differ greatly in their anaesthetic potency despite the similar oil/gas partition coefficients. For example, the R-(+) isomer of etomidate is 10 times more potent anaesthetic than its S-(-) isomer. This means that optical isomers partition identically into lipid, but have differential effects on ion channels and synaptic transmission. This objection provides a compelling evidence that the primary target for anaesthetics is not the achiral lipid bilayer itself but rather stereoselective binding sites on membrane proteins that provide a chiral environment for specific anaesthetic-protein docking interactions.

Rebuttal to the objection: 1) Stereo selective transport of the anesthetic was never considered. Anesthetics are hydrophobic and transported bound to proteins in the blood. Any stereo selective binding to the transport protein would change the concentration at the site of action. Furthermore a protein sink in the membrane could bind one of the isomers slightly better and reduce the effective concentration the membrane experiences. All stereo isomers are effective anesthetics, they only shifted the sensitivity, suggesting selective transport and selective protein sinks need to be considered. 2) Lipids are chiral, the same as proteins. And like proteins, lipids have ordered and disordered regions. The field failed to investigate the chirality of ordered lipids due to a lack of knowledge of their existence.

=== 2. Nonimmobilizers ===

All general anaesthetics induce immobilization (absence of movement in response to noxious stimuli) through depression of spinal cord functions, whereas their amnesic actions are exerted within the brain. According to the Meyer-Overton correlation the anaesthetic potency of the drug is directly proportional to its lipid solubility, however, there are many compounds that do not satisfy this rule. These drugs are strikingly similar to potent general anaesthetics and are predicted to be potent anaesthetics based on their lipid solubility, but they exert only one constituent of the anaesthetic action (amnesia) and do not suppress movement (i.e. do not depress spinal cord functions) as all anaesthetics do. These drugs are referred to as nonimmobilizers. The existence of nonimmobilizers suggests that anaesthetics induce different components of anaesthetic effect (amnesia and immobility) by affecting different molecular targets and not just the one target (neuronal bilayer) as it was believed earlier. Good example of non-immobilizers are halogenated alkanes that are very hydrophobic, but fail to suppress movement in response to noxious stimulation at appropriate concentrations. See also: flurothyl.

Rebuttal to the objection: This is a logical fallacy. The hypothesis does not require that every molecule ever tested obeys the hypothesis for the hypothesis to be true. The existence of less than 10-20 related compounds that are known to disobey the Meyer-Overton hypothesis in no way negates the hundreds if not thousands of chemically diverse compounds that do obey the Overton-Meyer hypothesis. Exceptions can exist for reasons unrelated to the mechanism underlying the Meyer-Overton hypothesis.

=== 3. Temperature increases do not have anaesthetic effect ===

Experimental studies have shown that general anaesthetics including ethanol are potent fluidizers of natural and artificial membranes. However, changes in membrane density and fluidity in the presence of clinical concentrations of general anaesthetics are so small that relatively small increases in temperature (~1 °C) can mimic them without causing anaesthesia. The change in body temperature of approximately 1 °C is within the physiological range and clearly it is not sufficient to induce loss of consciousness per se. Thus membranes are fluidized only by large quantities of anaesthetics, but there are no changes in membrane fluidity when concentrations of anaesthetics are small and restricted to be pharmacologically relevant.

Rebuttal to the objection: Early studies only considered the fluidity of the bulk lipid membrane. Recent work has shown that temperature changes can occur over several degrees in ordered nanoscopic lipid domains. Furthermore, fluidity is actively regulated by fatty acid desaturases. And lastly, competition of anesthetics with palmitoylated proteins occurs independent of temperature and despite increased ordered lipids. 

=== 4. Effect vanishes beyond a certain chain length ===

According to the Meyer-Overton correlation, in a homologous series of any general anaesthetic (e.g. &quot;n&quot;-alcohols, or alkanes), increasing the chain length increases the lipid solubility, and thereby should produce a corresponding increase in anaesthetic potency. However, beyond a certain chain length the anaesthetic effect disappears. For the &quot;n&quot;-alcohols, this cutoff occurs at a carbon chain length of about 13 and for the &quot;n&quot;-alkanes at a chain length of between 6 and 10, depending on the species.

If general anaesthetics disrupt ion channels by partitioning into and perturbing the lipid bilayer, then one would expect that their solubility in lipid bilayers would also display the cutoff effect. However, partitioning of alcohols into lipid bilayers does not display a cutoff for long-chain alcohols from &quot;n&quot;-decanol to &quot;n&quot;-pentadecanol. A plot of chain length vs. the logarithm of the lipid bilayer/buffer partition coefficient &quot;K&quot; is linear, with the addition of each methylene group causing a change in the Gibbs free energy of -3.63 kJ/mol.

The cutoff effect was first interpreted as evidence that anaesthetics exert their effect not by acting globally on membrane lipids but rather by binding directly to hydrophobic pockets of well-defined volumes in proteins. As the alkyl chain grows, the anaesthetic fills more of the hydrophobic pocket and binds with greater affinity. When the molecule is too large to be entirely accommodated by the hydrophobic pocket, the binding affinity no longer increases with increasing chain length. Thus the volume of the n-alkanol chain at the cutoff length provides an estimate of the binding site volume. This objection provided the basis for protein hypothesis of anaesthetic effect (see below).

However, cutoff effect can still be explained in the frame of lipid hypothesis. In short-chain alkanols (A) segments of the chain are rather rigid (in terms of conformational enthropy) and very close to hydroxyl group tethered to aqueous interfacial region (&quot;buoy&quot;). Consequently, these segments efficiently redistribute lateral stresses from the bilayer interior toward the interface. In long-chain alkanols (B) hydrocarbon chain segments are located further from hydroxyl group and are more flexible than in short-chain alkanols. Efficiency of pressure redistribution decreases as the length of hydrocarbon chain increases until anaesthetic potency is lost at some point. It was proposed that polyalkanols (C) will have anaesthetic effect similar to short-chain 1-alkanols if the chain length between two neighbouring hydroxyl groups is smaller than the cutoff. This idea was supported by the experimental evidence because polyhydroxyalkanes 1,6,11,16-hexadecanetetraol and 2,7,12,17-octadecanetetraol exhibited significant anaesthetic potency as was originally proposed.

Rebuttal to the objection: The argument assumes that all classes of anaesthetics must work the same on the membrane. It is quite possible that one or two classes of molecules could work through a non-membrane mediated mechanism. For example, the alcohols were shown to incorporate into the lipid membrane via an enzymatic transphosphatidylation reaction. The ethanol metabolite bound to and inhibited an anesthetic channel. And while this mechanism may contradict a single unitary mechanism of anaesthesia, it does not preclude a membrane mediated one.

<text>The Restaurants du Cœur (literally &quot;Restaurants of the Heart&quot; but meaning &quot;Restaurants of Love&quot;), commonly known as the Restos du Cœur, is a French charity founded by comedian Coluche (1944–1986) and its main activity is to distribute food packages and hot meals to those in need.

The association targets the homeless and those with of low income (single families, elderly people with a low pension, young adults, etc.). The association also helps people to find housing and supports other projects. This not-for-profit association has the &quot;reconnu d&#x27;utilité publique&quot; (recognised as being of public interest) status which exempts it from specific taxes. The association had 66,000 volunteers in 2015 and is known for its yearly Les Enfoirés fundraising concert.

== History ==
Comedian and actor Coluche launched the idea of the Restos du Cœur on 26 September 1985: &quot;I have a little idea, a bit like this... If there are people who would be interested in sponsoring a free soup kitchen, we&#x27;d start first in Paris and then spread to France&#x27;s big cities.&quot; The first Resto du Cœur opened on 21 December ahead of Christmas and soon multiplied all over the country. The goal of the founders was to give away 2,000 to 3,000 meals per day; 8.5 million meals were distributed in the first winter alone. In 2018, 130 million meals were served.

The initiative was supported by a song written by the songwriter and singer Jean-Jacques Goldman called &quot;les Restos du cœur&quot;, which included some of the lyrics being sung or read out by other celebrities. A televised show allowed the organisation to collect several million francs.

Coluche pleaded for the Restos&#x27; cause at the European Parliament in February 1986 after learning that surplus products cost more to store than to distribute free to the poor; his plea was heard and in 1987 the surplus was made available to four organisations.

==Operation==

===Structure and Organisation===
The Restos du Cœur consists of one national organisation and 119 departmental organisations.

====The National Organisation====
Founded by the comedian and actor Coluche in 1985, &quot;Les Restos du Cœur - Relais du Cœur&quot; is a voluntary association as defined by the French association law of 1901. Recognised as being of public interest, its goal is to help the neediest and to fight social marginalisation.

It is a founding member of the Committee of the Charter of Deontology of Social and Humanitarian Organisations, a group of associations committed to financial transparency. It owns the name and logo of the Restos du Cœur.

Every year, the general assembly elects its governing body, which in turn chooses the president and the board from its members. The board enacts the policy of the Restos, as defined by the general assembly, at weekly meetings. The national organisation&#x27;s goals are:
*to centralise purchases of food and to supply it to the departments;
*to encourage the departmental organisations to be involved in the reintegration of their beneficiaries into society, and to support them in their endeavours using technical and financial support;
*to ensure the training of volunteers;
*to oversee, using policy officers, the consistency of their messages;
*to control and consolidate the accounts of the departmental organisations, to look after their well-being, and to ensure their respect for the rules;
*and to maintain communication between the Restos.

====The Departmental Branches====
The 113 departmental organisations can be found throughout 96 departments. Although they are legally autonomous, they operate using the same principles as the national organisation (general assemblies, governing bodies, boards), and are bound to them by a contractual agreement.

The departmental organisations manage, activate and coordinate activities on the ground with 40,000 volunteers in almost 2,500 Restos, which together welcome 600,000 beneficiaries a day. Their aims are to provide food aid, lodging, workshops (such as the &quot;Jardins du Cœur&quot; - &quot;Gardens of the Heart&quot;) and cultural activities.

All these reintegration programmes exist to help beneficiaries to become normal citizens. Under the heading of &quot;reinsertion into society&quot; are several different kinds of activities:
*from workshops to gardens;
*from trucks doing nightly rounds in the big cities to long-term lodging solutions;
*and from cultural activities to picnics.

Though the soup kitchens remain the most visible face of the Restos, they alone cannot ease the exclusion of those benefiting from their existence. Reinsertion is therefore considered top priority.

The &quot;Les Restos demain&quot; (&quot;The Restos Tomorrow&quot;) survey, which polled more than 13,000 beneficiaries and volunteers in 1998 and 1999, confirmed the need to evolve and reinforced the will to extend the beneficiary-volunteer partnership.

===A Need for Clarity===
The Restos du Cœur are attentive to the good use of the funds. As an organisation essentially financed by private donors, public funds and public organisations, and with its activities carried out by volunteers, its overheads are generally very low (around 8% of resources) and unnecessary expenses are eliminated. Invitations to tender ensure that best value for money is obtained. Consequently, 90% of financial resources are devoted to activities.

In line with the organisation&#x27;s legislation, the accounts of the organisation are inspected by auditors. Occasional discrepancies by some local groups are sanctioned and transmitted to the courts.

Voted on and passed in 1988, the loi Coluche (&quot;Coluche law&quot;) permits small donors (the largest segment of funders) to benefit from the same tax breaks as big donors. A later amendment permits donors to get a tax break of 75% for donations up to €470. Above that, and within a limit of 20% of income, the tax break is 66%. Each donor receives a tax form on which an accountant confirms all the necessary calculations for the tax break, and a document stating how the money donated will be used by the Restos.

Since 1987, the Restos du Cœur have benefited financially from the European Plan to Help the Neediest (Plan européen d&#x27;aide aux plus démunis, or PEAD).

==The People==

===Donors===
There are many different kinds of donors:
*From children to the elderly, from artisans to multinationals, from housewives to stars, individuals are, in various ways, the most reliable supporters.
*Those who generously give their services (loan of buildings, transport, printing...) or participate in authorised protests, which are strictly regulated financially and legally.
*Those who give money by buying an Enfoirés CD (les Enfoirés - &quot;The Tossers&quot; or &quot;The Bastards&quot; in English - is the name of an annual concert to raise money for the cause), by bequeathing their goods or money, or by giving up their copyright over a work.
*Those who give goods (books, clothes, food, hygiene products...).

However, the following are all forbidden:
*fundraising or garage sales;
*commercial operations without the consent of the Restos du Cœur;
*and direct mailing canvassing financial donations, apart from those from the organisation itself.

===Volunteers===
The first campaign for the Restos du Cœur in 1985 netted 5,000 volunteers. Today, there are more than 63,000 of all backgrounds with one point in common: generosity devoid of political or religious points of view. Their actions are based on the Volunteers&#x27; Charter, whose six guiding points guarantee the good working order of the organisation. To fulfil their mission well, each volunteer undergoes a training period enabling them to learn the techniques necessary for their mission. Two professional trainers and some experienced volunteers give seminars where volunteers from all around France gather. Classes about the following subjects are held:
*managing a Resto;
*welcoming people who no longer try for or want to get help;
*accompanying those who ask for moral support;
*helping those who have trouble paying rent on the homes they have finally found;
*and teaching at a workshop or a garden.

===Artists===
Coluche knew that the best way he could help the Restos was to present his own image and those of his friends. In one winter, he created the Enfoirés around this idea.

On 26 January 1986, Coluche presented a show on national television that lasted all afternoon. An exceptional group of people gathered together: politicians of all stripes, presenters from all the TV channels and radio stations, and all kinds of artists and sports stars.

Since then, every year an Enfoirés concert has been held to encourage people to donate to the Restos du Cœur. It has become a very popular event. Each year, the media explain the goals of the organisation and remind people of where they can donate or volunteer. The Enfoirés themselves support the Restos by giving up the profits from the concerts and albums of these concerts.

There was also a charity song about it on TF1 (2012 &quot;appel aux dons&quot; spot), beautifully accompanied with the music of the Spanish band PLOU .

==The Restos abroad==

===Belgium: 1986===
There are 16 Restos in Belgium: 12 in Wallonia, two in Flanders and two in Brussels. Coluche inaugurated the first one, in Liège, on 22 February 1986. It was immediately decided to leave it open all year long, and as elsewhere, the services provided were quickly swamped.

The Belgian Federation of Restos currently offers many services (social, legal, reinsertion...), and help (administrative, financial, medical, lodging...).

===Germany: 1997===
One can also find &quot;Restaurant des Herzens&quot; in Germany, specifically in Erfurt and Leipzig.

In Erfurt, there is a cultural programme with theatre and music, and even a Father Christmas for the children. In 2004, however, dwindling donations resulted in reduced opening hours.

In Leipzig, the beneficiaries have to pay 50 euro cents per meal, otherwise the distribution of food would be impossible to finance. Nevertheless, a free minibus service operates between the central railway station and the restaurant.

<text>In cryptography, SAFER (Secure and Fast Encryption Routine) is the name of a family of block ciphers designed primarily by James Massey (one of the designers of IDEA) on behalf of Cylink Corporation. Its first variant was published in 1993, and other variants were published until about 2000. The early SAFER K and SAFER SK designs share the same encryption function, but differ in the number of rounds and the key schedule. More recent versions – SAFER+ and SAFER++ – were submitted as candidates to the AES process in 1998 and the NESSIE project in 2000, respectively. All of the algorithms in the SAFER family are unpatented and available for unrestricted use.

==SAFER K and SAFER SK==

The first SAFER cipher was SAFER K-64, published by Massey in 1993, with a 64-bit block size. The &quot;K-64&quot; denotes a key size of 64 bits. There was some demand for a version with a larger 128-bit key, and the following year Massey published such a variant incorporating new key schedule designed by the Singapore Ministry for Home affairs: SAFER K-128. However, both Lars Knudsen and Sean Murphy found minor weaknesses in this version, prompting a redesign of the key schedule to one suggested by Knudsen; these variants were named SAFER SK-64 and SAFER SK-128 respectively – the &quot;SK&quot; standing for &quot;Strengthened Key schedule&quot;, though the RSA FAQ reports that, &quot;one joke has it that SK really stands for &#x27;Stop Knudsen&#x27;, a wise precaution in the design of any block cipher&quot;. Another variant with a reduced key size was published, SAFER SK-40, to comply with 40-bit export restrictions.

All of these ciphers use the same round function consisting of four stages, as shown in the diagram: a key-mixing stage, a substitution layer, another key-mixing stage, and finally a diffusion layer. In the first key-mixing stage, the plaintext block is divided into eight 8-bit segments, and subkeys are added using either addition modulo 256 (denoted by a &quot;+&quot; in a square) or XOR (denoted by a &quot;+&quot; in a circle). The substitution layer consists of two S-boxes, each the inverse of each other, derived from discrete exponentiation (45&quot;x&quot;) and logarithm (log45x) functions. After a second key-mixing stage there is the diffusion layer: a novel cryptographic component termed a pseudo-Hadamard transform (PHT). (The PHT was also later used in the Twofish cipher.)

==SAFER+ and SAFER++==
There are two more-recent members of the SAFER family that have made changes to the main encryption routine, designed by the Armenian cryptographers Gurgen Khachatrian (American University of Armenia) and Melsik Kuregian in conjunction with Massey.

* SAFER+ (Massey et al., 1998) was submitted as a candidate for the Advanced Encryption Standard and has a block size of 128 bits. The cipher was not selected as a finalist. Bluetooth uses custom algorithms based on SAFER+ for key derivation (called E21 and E22) and authentication as message authentication codes (called E1). Encryption in Bluetooth does not use SAFER+.
* SAFER++ (Massey et al., 2000) was submitted to the NESSIE project in two versions, one with 64 bits, and the other with 128 bits.

<text>Milton Brown (September 8, 1903 – April 18, 1936) was an American band leader and vocalist who co-founded the genre of Western swing. His band was the first to fuse hillbilly hokum, jazz, and pop together into a unique, distinctly American hybrid, thus giving him the nickname, &quot;Father of Western Swing&quot;. The birthplace of Brown&#x27;s upbeat &quot;hot-jazz hillbilly&quot; string band sound was developed at the Crystal Springs Dance Hall in Fort Worth, Texas, from 1931 to 1936.
Along with Bob Wills, with whom he performed at the beginning of his career, Brown developed the sound and style of Western swing in the early 1930s. For a while, he and his band, the Musical Brownies, were more popular than Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys. Brown&#x27;s career was cut short in 1936 when he died following a car accident.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Born in Stephenville, Texas, in 1903, Brown moved to Fort Worth, Texas, in 1918. After graduating from Fort Worth&#x27;s Arlington Heights High School in 1925, he worked as a cigar salesman, but he lost his job when the Great Depression hit in the late &#x27;20s.

Brown began his musical career in 1930, when he met Bob Wills and guitarist Herman Arnspiger. They were performing at a local Fort Worth dance and Brown joined the duo on a chorus of &quot;St. Louis Blues&quot;. The trio decided to team up to play medicine shows around Texas and Brown landed a regular radio spot on WBAP for the group, where they played a show sponsored by Aladdin Lamp Company, which had the band change its name to the Aladdin Laddies.

===Light Crust Doughboys===
In early 1931, the group was hired by the Light Crust Flour Company—which was run by Burrus Mill and Elevator Company—to appear daily on the radio station KFJZ. The company, which was managed by W. Lee O&#x27;Daniel (also known as &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel) who hosted the radio shows, had the group rename themselves the Light Crust Doughboys. The Doughboys were an instant success, and soon O&#x27;Daniel moved them to another radio station, then syndicated the program statewide.

The Doughboys were playing cowboy songs, jazz, blues, and popular songs—a repertoire so diverse that the band&#x27;s audience continued to expand. In February 1932, they recorded a single for Victor under the name the Fort Worth Doughboys. The band was playing dance music and wanted to play at dances, but O&#x27;Daniel was reluctant to let the group play outside of their radio shows. He also was hesitant to pay them much money, which angered Brown. In September 1932, in need of additional money to support his aging parents, Brown left the band after he had an argument about money with O&#x27;Daniel.

===Musical Brownies===
After leaving the Light Crust Doughboys, Brown formed the world&#x27;s first Western swing band in Fort Worth, Texas, the Musical Brownies. The first incarnation of the Brownies featured Brown, guitarist Derwood Brown, bassist Wanna Coffman, Ocie Stockard on tenor banjo, and fiddle player Jesse Ashlock. Shortly afterward, pianist Fred &quot;Papa&quot; Calhoun and fiddle player Cecil Brower (who replaced Ashlock) joined the group. Like the Light Crust Doughboys, the Musical Brownies played a mixture of country, pop, and jazz, but the Brownies had a harder rhythm &amp; blues dance edge than their predecessors.

Almost immediately, Brown and His Musical Brownies were a huge success. The group had a regular spot on the radio station KTAT and drew large crowds to various Texas and Oklahoma dance halls. Their home venue, Crystal Springs Dance Hall in Fort Worth, was sold out nearly every Saturday night from 1933 to 1936. Brown and Wills remained friends.

In April 1934, the band recorded eight songs for Bluebird Records; and then another ten recordings for the label in August. Brown and his talented group of musicians were responsible for numerous innovations, notably in late 1934, the Brownies added the true pioneer of the world&#x27;s first electrically amplified steel guitar—Bob Dunn. Dunn was a jazz guitarist who first heard electric steel guitar played by a down and out blues performer on the Coney Island Boardwalk—Dunn&#x27;s innovative steel guitar solo riffs single-handedly created country &amp; western&#x27;s most recognized solo instrumental sound. His upbeat &quot;Taking Off&quot; instrumental is an example of his inspired solos; a towering inspiration to many Western swing, country and even rock guitarists in the years to follow.

In January 1935, Brown&#x27;s band signed with Decca records and recorded 36 songs for the label with Brown singing lead vocals on most all of the tracks. Released as singles over the course of 1935, the songs helped establish the band as the most popular Western swing band in the entire southwest United States. In March 1936, Brown and his Musical Brownies travelled to New Orleans to record their second set of sessions for Decca. By this time, fiddler Brower had been replaced by Cliff Bruner. At these sessions, the Brownies cut about 50 songs, which were issued throughout 1936 and 1937.

==Death==

On the morning of April 13, 1936, Brown suffered a car accident, which may have been attributed to his habitual falling asleep at inopportune times, possibly narcolepsy. Although he survived the impact and was expected to recover, he died five days later from pneumonia. Brown&#x27;s single-car accident occurred on Fort Worth&#x27;s Jacksboro Highway after the car he was driving hit a telephone pole. A 16-year-old girl, Katy Prehoditch, was killed in the crash. She had slipped away from her house without her parents&#x27; knowledge to go to Crystal Springs Dance Hall with friends. Brown had agreed to give the girl a ride home.

Brown was taken to Fort Worth&#x27;s Methodist Hospital where his injuries were initially believed to not be life-threatening. However, one of his broken ribs had punctured a lung. Pneumonia set in and he died five days later. The site of the crash was in the southbound lane of Jacksboro Highway directly across the street from the &quot;Avalon Motel&quot; which still stands today... and quite eerily, Brown had recorded the song &quot;Avalon&quot; two months prior to his accident.

Following Brown&#x27;s death, Derwood Brown kept the Musical Brownies together for two years, recording a dozen sides for Decca in 1937.

<doc id="630500" wikidata="Q2052486" url="?curid=630500" title="1999 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom">
<text>The 1999 European Parliament election was the United Kingdom&#x27;s part of the European Parliament election 1999. It was held on 10 June 1999. Following the European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999, it was the first European election to be held in the United Kingdom where the whole country used a system of proportional representation. In total, 87 Members of the European Parliament were elected from the United Kingdom across twelve new regional constituencies.

The change in voting system resulted in significant changes in seats. The Conservatives won double the number of seats they had won in the previous European election, in 1994, while the Labour Party saw its seats reduced from 62 to 29. The Liberal Democrats saw their number of seats increase to 10 from just 2 in the previous election. The UK Independence Party (UKIP), Green Party and Plaid Cymru gained their first seats in the European Parliament.

A by-election to the British Parliament also took place on the same day in the Leeds Central constituency - Labour held the seat but with significantly reduced turnout.

The House of Commons Library calculated notional seat changes based on what the result would have been if the 1994 European elections had been held under proportional representation. The notional results and seat changes are shown in the results box for this article.

It was the first European Parliament election to be held since the 1997 general election which resulted in a change of government from Conservative to Labour.

Turnout was 24%, the lowest of any member state in the 1999 election where the EU average was 49.51%. It was also the lowest of any European election in the United Kingdom, and the lowest of any member state until the 2009 election and to date is the lowest turnout for any national election in the history of the United Kingdom.

==Background==

===Electoral system===
The European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 introduced a closed-list party list system method of proportional representation, calculated using the D&#x27;Hondt method into Great Britain. In Northern Ireland, the Single Transferable Vote, which is also a form of proportional representation, which had been used since the first European election in 1979 was retained. The Act also created twelve new electoral regions, which were based on the British government&#x27;s nine administrative Regions of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The effect of the introduction of proportional representation was that many small parties won seats to the European Parliament for the first time.

==Results==
===United Kingdom===
The Conservatives doubled the number of seats from the last European election. Labour saw their 62 seats reduced to just 29. It was the first European Parliament election to be held since the change of United Kingdom government from Conservative to Labour two years earlier. The Liberal Democrats saw their number of seats increase to 10 from just 2 in the previous election. The UK Independence Party, Green Party and Plaid Cymru won their first seats in the European Parliament.

These changes were largely due to the move to proportional representation from first-past-the-post. The House of Commons Library calculated that if the 1994 European elections had been held under proportional representation, Labour would have won 43 MEPs, the Conservatives 26, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP 3 and Plaid Cymru 1.

==Aftermath==
Labour&#x27;s results brought about a debate within the party about the introduction of proportional representation. In September 1998, a poll of 150 MPs had found that 58% backed the introduction of proportional representation. A follow-up poll ran on the Sunday after the election found that this had decreased to 43%, with the majority wanting a return to the first-past-the-post system. It has also been argued, however, that the introduction of proportional representation actually reduced Labour&#x27;s losses, as first-past-the-post is more sensitive to swings in public opinion.

<text>In mathematics, algebraic geometry and analytic geometry are two closely related subjects. While algebraic geometry studies algebraic varieties, analytic geometry deals with complex manifolds and the more general analytic spaces defined locally by the vanishing of analytic functions of several complex variables. The deep relation between these subjects has numerous applications in which algebraic techniques are applied to analytic spaces and analytic techniques to algebraic varieties.

== Main statement ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective complex algebraic variety. Because &quot;X&quot; is a complex variety, its set of complex points &quot;X&quot;(C) can be given the structure of a compact complex analytic space. This analytic space is denoted &quot;X&quot;an. Similarly, if formula_1 is a sheaf on &quot;X&quot;, then there is a corresponding sheaf formula_2 on &quot;X&quot;an. This association of an analytic object to an algebraic one is a functor. The prototypical theorem relating &quot;X&quot; and &quot;X&quot;an says that for any two coherent sheaves formula_1 and formula_4 on &quot;X&quot;, the natural homomorphism:
:formula_5
is an isomorphism. Here formula_6 is the structure sheaf of the algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; and formula_7 is the structure sheaf of the analytic variety &quot;X&quot;an. More precisely, the category of coherent sheaves on the algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; is equivalent to the category of analytic coherent sheaves on the analytic variety &quot;X&quot;an, and the equivalence is given on objects by mapping formula_1 to formula_2. (Note in particular that formula_10 itself is coherent, a result known as the Oka coherence theorem, and also, it was proved in “Faisceaux Algebriques Coherents” that the structure sheaf of the algebraic variety formula_6 is coherent.

Another important statement is as follows: For any coherent sheaf formula_1 on an algebraic variety &quot;X&quot; the homomorphisms
:formula_13
are isomorphisms for all &quot;q&quot;&#x27;s. This means that the &quot;q&quot;-th cohomology group on &quot;X&quot; is isomorphic to the cohomology group on &quot;X&quot;an.

The theorem applies much more generally than stated above (see the formal statement below). It and its proof have many consequences, such as Chow&#x27;s theorem, the Lefschetz principle and Kodaira vanishing theorem.

== Background ==
Algebraic varieties are locally defined as the common zero sets of polynomials and since polynomials over the complex numbers are holomorphic functions, algebraic varieties over C can be interpreted as analytic spaces. Similarly, regular morphisms between varieties are interpreted as holomorphic mappings between analytic spaces. Somewhat surprisingly, it is often possible to go the other way, to interpret analytic objects in an algebraic way. 

For example, it is easy to prove that the analytic functions from the Riemann sphere to itself are either
the rational functions or the identically infinity function (an extension of Liouville&#x27;s theorem). For if such a function &quot;f&quot; is nonconstant, then since the set of &quot;z&quot; where &quot;f(z)&quot; is infinity is isolated and the Riemann sphere is compact, there are finitely many &quot;z&quot; with &quot;f(z)&quot; equal to infinity. Consider the Laurent expansion at all such &quot;z&quot; and subtract off the singular part: we are left with a function on the Riemann sphere with values in C, which by Liouville&#x27;s theorem is constant. Thus &quot;f&quot; is a rational function. This fact shows there is no essential difference between the complex projective line as an algebraic variety, or as the Riemann sphere.

== Important results ==
There is a long history of comparison results between algebraic geometry and analytic geometry, beginning in the nineteenth century. Some of the more important advances are listed here in chronological order.

=== Riemann&#x27;s existence theorem ===

Riemann surface theory shows that a compact Riemann surface has enough meromorphic functions on it, making it an (smooth projective) algebraic curve. Under the name Riemann&#x27;s existence theorem a deeper result on ramified coverings of a compact Riemann surface was known: such &quot;finite&quot; coverings as topological spaces are classified by permutation representations of the fundamental group of the complement of the ramification points. Since the Riemann surface property is local, such coverings are quite easily seen to be coverings in the complex-analytic sense. It is then possible to conclude that they come from covering maps of algebraic curves—that is, such coverings all come from finite extensions of the function field.

=== The Lefschetz principle ===
In the twentieth century, the Lefschetz principle, named for Solomon Lefschetz, was cited in algebraic geometry to justify the use of topological techniques for algebraic geometry over any algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot; of characteristic 0, by treating &quot;K&quot; as if it were the complex number field. An elementary form of it asserts that true statements of the first order theory of fields about C are true for any algebraically closed field &quot;K&quot; of characteristic zero. A precise principle and its proof are due to Alfred Tarski and are based in mathematical logic.

This principle permits the carrying over of some results obtained using analytic or topological methods for algebraic varieties over C to other algebraically closed ground fields of characteristic 0. (e.g. Kodaira type vanishing theorem.)

=== Chow&#x27;s theorem ===
Chow&#x27;s theorem (), proved by Wei-Liang Chow, is an example of the most immediately useful kind of comparison available. It states that an analytic subspace of complex projective space that is closed (in the ordinary topological sense) is an algebraic subvariety. This can be rephrased as &quot;any analytic subspace of complex projective space that is closed in the strong topology is closed in the Zariski topology.&quot; This allows quite a free use of complex-analytic methods within the classical parts of algebraic geometry.

=== GAGA ===
Foundations for the many relations between the two theories were put in place during the early part of the 1950s, as part of the business of laying the foundations of algebraic geometry to include, for example, techniques from Hodge theory. The major paper consolidating the theory was by Jean-Pierre Serre, now usually referred to as GAGA. It proves general results that relate classes of algebraic varieties, regular morphisms and sheaves with classes of analytic spaces, holomorphic mappings and sheaves. It reduces all of these to the comparison of categories of sheaves.

Nowadays the phrase &quot;GAGA-style result&quot; is used for any theorem of comparison, allowing passage between a category of objects from algebraic geometry, and their morphisms, to a well-defined subcategory of analytic geometry objects and holomorphic mappings.

==== Formal statement of GAGA ====
# Let formula_14 be a scheme of finite type over C. Then there is a topological space &quot;X&quot;an that as a set consists of the closed points of &quot;X&quot; with a continuous inclusion map λX: &quot;X&quot;an → &quot;X&quot;. The topology on &quot;X&quot;an is called the &quot;complex topology&quot; (and is very different from the subspace topology).
# Suppose φ: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is a morphism of schemes of locally finite type over C. Then there exists a continuous map φan: &quot;X&quot;an → &quot;Y&quot;an such that λ&quot;Y&quot; ∘ φan = φ ∘ λX.
# There is a sheaf formula_15 on &quot;X&quot;an such that formula_16 is a ringed space and λX: &quot;X&quot;an → &quot;X&quot; becomes a map of ringed spaces. The space formula_16 is called the &quot;analytification&quot; of formula_14 and is an analytic space. For every φ: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; the map φan defined above is a mapping of analytic spaces. Furthermore, the map φ ↦ φan maps open immersions into open immersions. If &quot;X&quot; = Spec(C[&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;x&quot;n]) then &quot;X&quot;an = C&quot;n&quot; and formula_19 for every polydisc &quot;U&quot; is a suitable quotient of the space of holomorphic functions on &quot;U&quot;.
# For every sheaf formula_20 on &quot;X&quot; (called algebraic sheaf) there is a sheaf formula_21 on &quot;X&quot;an (called analytic sheaf) and a map of sheaves of formula_22-modules formula_23. The sheaf formula_21 is defined as formula_25. The correspondence formula_26 defines an exact functor from the category of sheaves over formula_27 to the category of sheaves of formula_16.&lt;br&gt;The following two statements are the heart of Serre&#x27;s GAGA theorem (as extended by Alexander Grothendieck, Amnon Neeman, and others).
# If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is an arbitrary morphism of schemes of finite type over C and formula_20 is coherent then the natural map formula_30 is injective. If &quot;f&quot; is proper then this map is an isomorphism. One also has isomorphisms of all higher direct image sheaves formula_31 in this case.
# Now assume that &quot;X&quot;an is Hausdorff and compact. If formula_32 are two coherent algebraic sheaves on formula_27 and if formula_34 is a map of sheaves of formula_15-modules then there exists a unique map of sheaves of formula_22-modules formula_37 with formula_38. If formula_39 is a coherent analytic sheaf of formula_15-modules over &quot;X&quot;an then there exists a coherent algebraic sheaf formula_20 of formula_22-modules and an isomorphism formula_43.

In slightly lesser generality, the GAGA theorem asserts that the category of coherent algebraic sheaves on a complex projective variety &quot;X&quot; and the category of coherent analytic sheaves on the corresponding analytic space &quot;X&quot;an are equivalent. The analytic space &quot;X&quot;an is obtained roughly by pulling back to &quot;X&quot; the complex structure from C&quot;n&quot; through the coordinate charts. Indeed, phrasing the theorem in this manner is closer in spirit to Serre&#x27;s paper, seeing how the full scheme-theoretic language that the above formal statement uses heavily had not yet been invented by the time of GAGA&#x27;s publication.

<doc id="630517" wikidata="Q1616638" url="?curid=630517" title="HP-IL">
<text>The HP-IL (&quot;Hewlett-Packard Interface Loop&quot;) was a short-range interconnection bus or network introduced by Hewlett-Packard in the early 1980s. It enabled many devices such as printers, plotters, displays, storage devices (floppy disk drives and tape drives), test equipment, etc. to be connected to programmable calculators such as the HP-41C, HP-71B and HP-75C/D, the Series 80 and HP-110 computers, as well as generic ISA bus based PCs.

==Principles==

As its name implies, an HP-IL network formed a loop (i.e. it was a Ring network): each device in the loop had a pair of two-wire connections, one designated &quot;in&quot;, which received messages from the previous device in the loop; and one designated &quot;out&quot;, which delivered messages to the next device in the loop. One device on the loop is designated the &quot;controller&quot;, and manages all other devices on the loop. HP-IL cables utilize a unique two-pin connector design with polarizing D-shaped shells, and can be connected together without further adapters to extend their length.

HP-IL uses a token passing protocol for media access control: messages are passed from one device to the next until they return to the originator. When the loop is initialized, the controller sends an &quot;Auto Address 1&quot; message to the first device; that device (and each subsequent device) takes the number in the message it receives as its own address, and then forwards the message &quot;with the address incremented&quot; to the next device. When the &quot;Auto Address &quot;n&quot;&quot; message finally returns to the controller, it can tell how many devices are on the loop (&quot;n&quot;-1). Up to 31 devices can be addressed using this method. Once addresses are assigned, the controller can then assign &quot;talker&quot; or &quot;listener&quot; roles to any device on the loop. By addressing each device in turn, and using the &quot;Send Accessory ID&quot; message, the controller can determine the role and capability of each device on the loop.

When the controller assigns &quot;listener&quot; role to a device, that device accepts and processes data received from the loop. The role of &quot;talker&quot; allows a device to originate data on the loop. Multiple devices can be assigned the role of &quot;listener&quot; at once, but the role of &quot;talker&quot; can only be assigned to a single device at a time. Data transfer between loop devices is accomplished by the controller designating a talker and one or more listeners and then sourcing a &quot;Send Data&quot; message.

Most devices that were designed to be used as controllers were fixed in that role, but the HP-71B was capable of assuming either controller &quot;or&quot; device mode; and with the HP 82402 Dual HP-IL Adapter, the HP-71B could even be configured with multiple loops.

==Applications==
Hewlett-Packard developed a range of devices to be connected to the HP-IL, mostly peripherals such as printers and storage devices for calculators. Through the 82169A HP-IL/HP-IB Interface, HP-IL controllers could be connected to instruments with an HP-IB (aka GPIB or IEEE-488) interface, or vice versa. There were also plans to make test equipment with IL interfaces, but apart from the somewhat popular 3468A multimeter, only a few devices were introduced before HP-IL itself became obsolete.

In addition to the HP-IB interface, HP also sold RS-232 and general-purpose parallel I/O interfaces as well as a prototype kit to create custom interfaces.

===HP Calculator Applications===

Several HP calculators were offered with HP-IL interfaces. In the HP-75C/D it was built in, in others such as the HP-71 and HP-41, plug in interface modules were available (such as the HP82160A for the HP-41). Popular uses for the HP-IL on the calculators included printing (using the HP 82162A thermal printer) and cassette file storage (through the HP 82161A digital cassette drive). For ease of use, the calculators supported automatic I/O address assignment (&quot;AUTOIO&quot;), where printer or mass storage commands are directed to the first available device of the appropriate type. Where multiple devices per type were present, a manual (&quot;MANIO&quot;) assignment mode could be used.

===HP-IL to HP-IB interfacing===
Through the 82169A interface converter, even small calculators could be used to control a number of devices on a standard HP-IB (GPIB, IEEE-488) bus, an interface in wide use for test and measurement equipment. The converter can operate in either of two modes, &quot;Translator&quot; or &quot;Mailbox&quot;. Translator mode is adequate for systems where only one controller is present (typically a calculator on HP-IL), while Mailbox mode applies when there are separate controllers present on both buses.

In Translator mode with an HP-IL controller, the default addressing mode is to connect the converter as the last device in the HP-IL loop, to set its own HP-IB address higher than the number of devices on the HP-IL loop, and to set the addresses of devices to be addressed on the HP-IB side must be higher than the converter&#x27;s address. Deviating from this scheme requires manual control of addressing.

In Mailbox mode, the controllers on either side can place a message into the converter&#x27;s buffer memory, for the other side to retrieve from that memory.

<doc id="630518" wikidata="Q7732720" url="?curid=630518" title="The Evolution of Melanism">
<text>The Evolution of Melanism: a study of recurring necessity; with special reference to industrial melanism in the Lepidoptera is a 1973 science book by the lepidopterist Bernard Kettlewell.

The book includes Kettlewell&#x27;s original papers in the journal &quot;Heredity&quot; on his classic predation experiments on the peppered moth. It also covers Kettlewell&#x27;s experiments in Shetland on other Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies).

The book is centered on the authors research of evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths. It does not goes much in-depth about the evolution of melanism in other species as the title might suggest. 
The book introduces the reader with a 50-page long chapter about melanism. Then, the book goes in-depth about industrial melanism. Finally, the peppered moth &quot;Biston betularia&quot; is discussed in all its known details of that time. Knowledge of the genetics of the melanistic forms of the moths, the knowledge of the predation by birds and the knowledge of blackening of the environment in the English midlands is discussed and used for Kettlewell&#x27;s most important experiments on natural selection. This is also the climax of the book, namely the details and outcomes of his own experiments on natural selection. Kettlewell also shows other cases, such as his experiments in the Shetland Islands with &quot;Lasiocampa quercus&quot; (‘Recessive melanic plymorphisms’) and &quot;Amanthes glareosa&quot; (‘Northern melanism’) (Kettlewell et al., 1969). However, these lack knowledge compared to the &quot;Biston&quot; experiments. Therefore, they are mostly seem as secondary importance. However, according to Carson (1974), &quot;“they play an important role in showing that manifold genetic melanisms can exist apart from those that have evolved as a genetic response to industrial pollution”&quot;. The conclusion of the book discusses several melanisms, such as .

== Importance of the book==
The experiments with the peppered moths, as described in this book, are arguably the most dramatic and best known case of adaptive evolution. For many people at that time, this was the first evidence that they could see evolution taking place in the world around them, and could see how fast evolution can go since Darwin came up with the hypothesis (Kettlewell, 1959). In today&#x27;s biology books on primary schools and even in university books, this is still one of the most common example of adaptive evolution according to Carson (1974). 
It also led to more studies to industrial melanism in other species and places at that time but also currently. After his papers were published in the late 1950s (from which his book mostly consists of), there was an increase in studies. These included two-spot ladybirds (&quot;Adalia bipuncta&quot;) in the U.K. (Creed, 1970) and some &quot;Lepidoptera&quot; from North America (Owen, 1961). More recent studies were conducted on seasnakes (&quot;Emydocephalus annulatus&quot;) in New Caledonia (Goiran et al., 2017).

==Criticism==
Most of the information depicted in the book was already published before and it followed the presentation of Kettlewell&#x27;s papers. He has altered many figures and tables slightly compered to the originals which were mostly published in the journal Heredity. It was therefore criticised that this book was more a compilation of Kettlewell&#x27;s work instead of a synthesis (Carson, 1974). Furthermore, some of the black-and-white photographs were of better quality in the journals than in the book. 

The entomologist and geneticist Michael Majerus reviewed this in his 1998 book &quot;&quot;, and compared it with more recent studies which did not support some of Kettlewell&#x27;s conclusions. He called for more research, and in 2001 began extended experiments.
In 2002, Judith Hooper wrote a book about Kettlewell, &quot;Of Moths and Men&quot;, accusing Kettlewell of fraudulent data. Majerus concluded his research in 2007, with results which he described as a complete vindication of the natural selection theory of peppered moth evolution, answering the various questions which had been raised.

<text>Venda Nova do Imigrante is a municipality, with a capital of the same name, in east central Espírito Santo, Brazil. Created in 1989, by separating from Conceição do Castelo, it stands at a height of 630 meters above sea level. Its population was 25,745 (2020) and its area is 185.9 km2.

It was mainly colonised by northern Italian immigrants and still holds Italian-themed festivals such as the Polenta festival and wine festivals. Other such traditions still held on to are traditional Italian dancing and choral singing, often seen during such festivals.

==Geography==

Bordering municipalities include: (E) Domingos Martins, (N) Afonso Claudio, (W) Conceição do Castelo and Castelo in the south.

<doc id="630522" wikidata="Q338753" url="?curid=630522" title="Voting age">
<text>A legal voting age is the minimum age that a person is allowed to vote in a democratic process. For general elections around the world, the right to vote is restricted to adults, and most nations use 18 years of age as their voting age, but for other countries their voting age ranges between 16 and 21 (with the sole exception of the United Arab Emirates where the voting age is 25). A nation&#x27;s voting age may therefore coincide with the country&#x27;s age of majority, but in many cases the two are not tied.

==History==
In 1890, the South African Republic, commonly known as the Transvaal Republic, set a voting age of 18 years. The effort was, like later legislation expanding voting rights for women and impoverished whites, in part an attempt to skew the electorate further in favor of Afrikaner interests against uitlanders.

Prior to the Second World War of 1939–1945, the voting age in almost all countries was 21 years or higher. In 1946 Czechoslovakia became the first state to reduce the voting age to 18 years, and by 1968 a total of 17 countries had lowered their voting age, of which 8 were in Latin America, and 8 were communist countries.

Australia, Japan, Sweden and Switzerland had lowered their voting age to 20 by the end of the 1960s. 

Many major democratic countries, beginning in Western Europe and North America, reduced their voting ages to 18 years during the 1970s, starting with the United Kingdom (Representation of the People Act 1969), Canada, West Germany (1970), the United States (26th Amendment, 1971), Australia (1974), France (1974), Sweden (1975) and others. It was argued that if young men could be drafted to go to war at 18, they should be able to vote at the age of 18. 

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries voting ages were lowered to 18 in Japan, India, Switzerland, Austria, the Maldives, and Morocco. By the end of the 20th century, 18 had become by far the most common voting age. However, a few countries maintain a voting age of 20 years or higher, and a few countries have a lower voting age of 16 or 17.

=== Current ===
The vast majority of countries and territories have a minimum voting age of 18-years-old as of October 2020. According to data from the ACE Electoral Knowledge Network, 205 countries and territories have a minimum voting age of 18 for national elections out of 237 countries and territories the organization has data on as of October 2020. As of the aforementioned date, 12 countries or territories have a minimum voting age of less than 18, with 3 countries or territories at 17-years-old, and 9 countries or territories at 16-years-old. 16-years-old is the lowest minimum age globally for national elections, while the highest is 25-years-old which is only the case in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This age of 25 was also the case in Italy for Senate (upper house) elections until it was lowered to 18 in 2021. Italy&#x27;s lower house of Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, has had a minimum voting age of 18 since 1975, when it was lowered from 21.

==Debate on lowering the voting age==

Around 2000, a number of countries began to consider whether the voting age ought to be reduced further, with arguments most often being made in favor of a reduction to 16. In Brazil, the age was lowered to 16 in the 1988 Constitution, while the lower voting age took effect for the first time in the 1989 Presidential Election. The earliest moves in Europe came during the 1990s, when the voting age for municipal elections in some States of Germany was lowered to 16. Lower Saxony was the first state to make such a reduction, in 1995, and four other states did likewise.

In 2007, Austria became the first country to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in national elections, with the expanded franchise first being consummated in the 2009 European Parliament election. A study of young voters&#x27; behavior on that occasion showed them to be as capable as older voters to articulate their beliefs and to make voting decisions appropriate for their preferences. Their knowledge of the political process was only insignificantly lower than in older cohorts, while trust in democracy and willingness to participate in the process were markedly higher. Additionally, there was evidence found for the first time of a voting boost among young people age 16–25 in Austria.

During the 2000s several proposals for a reduced voting age were put forward in U.S. states, including California, Florida and Alaska, but none were successful. In Oregon, Senate Joint Resolution 22 has been introduced to reduce the voting age from 18 to 16. A national reduction was proposed in 2005 in Canada&lt;ref name=&quot;vote16.ca/2007&quot;&gt;Parliament of Canada, Bill C-261 (2005); Vote16, Canada &lt;/ref&gt; and in the Australian state of New South Wales, but these proposals were not adopted. In May 2009, Danish Member of Parliament Mogens Jensen presented an initiative to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in Strasbourg to lower the voting age in Europe to 16.

Demands to reduce the voting age to 16 years were again brought forward by activists of the school strike for climate movement in several countries (including Germany and the UK).

=== Australia ===
After Premier Don Dunstan introduced the Age of Majority (Reduction) Bill in October 1970, the voting age in South Australia was lowered from 21 to 18 in 1973.

On 21 October 2019, Greens MP Bandt introduced a bill in the House of Representatives to lower the voting age to 16.

A report suggesting that consideration be given to reducing the voting age to 16 in the Australian Capital Territory in Canberra, Australia was tabled in the territorial legislature on 26 September 2007 and defeated.

In 2015, federal Opposition Leader Bill Shorten said that the voting age should be lowered to 16.

=== Austria ===
In 2007, Austria became the first member of the European Union to adopt a voting age of 16 for most purposes. The voting age had been reduced in Austria from 19 to 18 at all levels in 1992. At that time a voting age of 16 was proposed by the Green Party, but was not adopted.

The voting age for municipal elections in some states was lowered to 16 shortly after 2000. Three states had made the reduction by 2003 (Burgenland, Carinthia and Styria), and in May 2003 Vienna became the fourth. Salzburg followed suit, and so by the start of 2005 the total had reached at least five states out of nine. As a consequence of state law, reduction of the municipal voting age in the states of Burgenland, Salzburg and Vienna resulted in the reduction of the regional voting age in those states as well.

After the 2006 election, the winning SPÖ-ÖVP coalition announced on 12 January 2007 that one of its policies would be the reduction of the voting age to 16 for elections in all states and at all levels in Austria. The policy was set in motion by a Government announcement on 14 March, and a bill proposing an amendment to the Constitution was presented to the legislature on 2 May. On 5 June the National Council approved the proposal following a recommendation from its Constitution Committee. During the passage of the bill through the chamber relatively little opposition was raised to the reduction, with four out of five parties explicitly supporting it; indeed, there was some dispute over which party had been the first to suggest the idea. Greater controversy surrounded the other provisions of the bill concerning the &quot;Briefwahl&quot;, or postal vote, and the extension of the legislative period for the National Council from four to five years. A further uncontroversial inclusion was a reduction in the candidacy age from 19 to 18. The Federal Council approved the Bill on 21 June, with no party voting against it. The voting age was reduced when the Bill&#x27;s provisions came into force on 1 July 2007. Austria thus became the first member of the European Union, and the first of the developed world democracies, to adopt a voting age of 16 for all purposes. Lowering the voting age encouraged political interest in young people in Austria. More sixteen- and seventeen-year-olds voted than eighteen-to-twenty-one-year-olds in Austria.

=== Brazil ===
Brazil lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 in the 1988 constitution. The presidential election of 1989 was the first with the lower voting age. People between the ages 18 and 70 are required to vote. The person must be 16 full years old on the eve of the election (In years without election, the person must be 16 full years old on or before 31 December). If they turn 18 years old after the election, the vote is not compulsory. When they turn 18 years old before the election, the vote is compulsory.

=== Canada ===
Canada lowered its federal voting age from 21 to 18 in 1970. Most Canadian provinces soon followed suit, though several initially lowered their voting age to 19. It wasn&#x27;t until 1992 when the last province, British Columbia, lowered its voting age to 18. A further reduction to 16 was proposed federally in 2005, but was not adopted. It was proposed again in 2011, but was not adopted.

In August 2018, in British Columbia, a group of 20 youth partnered with Dogwood BC to launch a Vote16 campaign. Currently, they have unanimous support from the Union of BC Municipalities, as well as endorsements from the province&#x27;s Green Party of British Columbia and British Columbia New Democratic Party representatives. The campaign is now waiting for it to be brought up in the legislative assembly by the NDP and for it to pass there.

In 2020, Canadian Senator Marilou McPhedran introduced a bill to lower the federal voting age from 18 to 16. She reintroduced it again in November 2021, (bill S-201), but it died on the floor when Parliament was prorogued in January 2025. In December 2021, a group of young people filed a court challenge to lower the federal voting age from 18, arguing that the voting age is unconstitutional for violating multiple sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Several weeks later, Taylor Bachrach of the New Democratic Party (NDP) introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to lower the voting age to 16. The bill (C-210) was debated in May 2022. The bill was defeated in its second reading with 245 members of parliament voting to oppose the bill and 77 voting to support it.

Political parties in Canada generally allow anyone 14 and up to join as full voting members. Though there are some exceptions, including the BC NDP, who set their internal voting age at 12.

=== Cuba ===
As stated in the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba, the voting age is 16 for men and women.

=== Germany ===
As part of their 2021 coalition deal, the SPD, Greens and FDP agreed to lower the voting age for European Elections to 16 within the course of the 20th Bundestag. They successfully did so in time for the 2024 European parliament elections. They also aimed to lower the voting age for elections to the German parliament. However, this would need a change of the constitution, which was blocked by the opposition CDU. Seven of the 16 states have also lowered their voting age for state elections and 11 of the 16 have lowered it for local elections.

=== Iceland ===
The first proposal to lower the voting age to 16 years was submitted in parliament in 2007. A bill to lower the voting age for municipal elections reached the final reading in 2018, but was filibustered by opponents until the close of the parliamentary session.

On 28 October 2023, the municipalities of Vesturbyggð and Tálknafjarðarhreppur held a referendum on unification; the voting age in this referendum was lowered to 16.

=== Iran ===
Iran had been unique in awarding suffrage at 15, but raised the age to 18 in January 2007 despite the opposition of the Government. In May 2007 the Iranian Cabinet proposed a bill to reverse the increase.

=== Luxembourg ===
Currently, Luxembourg has compulsory voting from the age of 18. 

Discussion about lowering the voting age to 16 was first introduced as part of a wider June 2015 referendum. The broader principles of the referendum which concerned electoral reform were rejected by 81% of voters.

Discussion, specifically surrounding the lowering of the voting age to 16 received almost universal support in 2025. Politically, only the ADR and CSV oppose the idea.

Malta

On 20 November 2013, Malta lowered the voting age from 18 to 16 for local elections starting from 2015. The proposal had wide support from both the government and opposition, social scientists and youth organizations.

On Monday, 5 March 2018, the Maltese Parliament unanimously voted in favor of amending the constitution, lowering the official voting age from 18 to 16 for general elections, European Parliament Elections and referendums, making Malta the second state in the EU to lower its voting age to 16.

=== New Zealand ===
The New Zealand Green Party MP Sue Bradford announced on 21 June 2007 that she intended to introduce her Civics Education and Voting Age Bill on the next occasion upon which a place became available for the consideration of Members&#x27; Bills. When this happened on 25 July Bradford abandoned the idea, citing an adverse public reaction. The Bill would have sought to reduce the voting age to 16 in New Zealand and make civics education part of the compulsory curriculum in schools.

On 21 November 2022, the Supreme Court of New Zealand ruled in Make It 16 Incorporated v Attorney-General that the voting age of 18 was &quot;inconsistent with the bill of rights to be free from discrimination on the basis of age&quot;. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern subsequently announced that a bill to lower the voting age to 16 would be debated in parliament, requiring a supermajority to pass. This bill was subsequently withdrawn in January 2024, after the Sixth National Government of New Zealand was elected.

=== United Kingdom ===
The Representation of the People Act 1969 lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 for elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the first major democratic nation to do so. The 1970 United Kingdom general election is the first in which this Act had effect.

Men in military service who turned 19 during the first world war were entitled to vote in 1918 irrespective of their age as part of the Representation of the People Act 1918 which also allowed some women over the age of 30 to vote. The Representation of the People (Equal Franchise) Act 1928 brought the voting age for women down to 21.

The reduction of the voting age to 16 in the United Kingdom was first given serious consideration in 1999, when the House of Commons considered in Committee an amendment proposed by Simon Hughes to the Representation of the People Bill. This was the first time the reduction of a voting age below 18 had ever been put to a vote in the Commons. The Government opposed the amendment, and it was defeated by 434 votes to 36.

The Votes at 16 coalition, a group of political and charitable organizations supporting a reduction of the voting age to 16, was launched on in 2003. At that time a Private Member&#x27;s Bill was also proposed in the House of Lords by Lord Lucas.

In 2004, the UK Electoral Commission conducted a major consultation on the subject of the voting age and age of candidacy, and received a significant response. In its conclusions, it recommended that the voting age remain at 18. In 2005, the House of Commons voted 136-128 (on a free vote) against a Private Member&#x27;s Bill for a reduction in the voting age to 16 proposed by Liberal Democrat MP Stephen Williams. Parliament chose not to include a provision reducing the voting age in the Electoral Administration Act during its passage in 2006.

The report of the Power Inquiry in 2006 called for a reduction of the voting age, and of the candidacy age for the House of Commons, to 16. On the same day the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, indicated in an article in The Guardian that he favored a reduction provided it was made concurrently with effective citizenship education.

The Ministry of Justice published in 2007 a Green Paper entitled The Governance of Britain, in which it proposed the establishment of a &quot;Youth Citizenship Commission&quot;. The Commission would examine the case for lowering the voting age. On launching the paper in the House of Commons, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: &quot;Although the voting age has been 18 since 1969, it is right, as part of that debate, to examine, and hear from young people themselves, whether lowering that age would increase participation.&quot;

During the Youth Parliament debates of in 2009 in the House of Commons, Votes at 16 was debated and young people of that age group voted for it overwhelmingly as a campaign priority. In April 2015, Labour announced that it would support the policy if it won an overall majority in the 2015 general election, which it failed to do.

In July 2024 however, Keir Starmer the current leader of the UK Labour Party, became elected as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As part of the parties 2024 manifesto (in the run up to the general election) Labour maintained this previous position, Keir Starmer himself confirming that he would lower the voting age from 18 to 16 in all elections (if elected). Prior to the 2024 election, the voting age in both Scotland and Wales was and is already set at 16, by the relevant governments of both UK nations (see detail specifics below).

There was some criticism about not reducing the voting age to 16 years for the referendum on the membership in the European Union in 2016.

YouGov poll research from 2018 shows that whilst the public are still opposed, there is growing support for extending the franchise. As of May 2019, all the main parties, with the exception of the Conservatives, back reducing the age to 16. Some have argued the Conservatives are hypocritical not to support this, as they allow 16-year-olds to vote in their leadership elections. It is also argued that all the main parties&#x27; approach is self-serving as younger voters are thought more likely to support left leaning parties and remaining in the EU, and less likely to support right leaning parties, and leaving the EU.

==== Scotland ====
The Scottish National Party conference voted unanimously on 27 October 2007 for a policy of reducing the voting age to 16 (the age of majority in Scotland), as well as in favor of a campaign for the necessary power to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

In September 2011, it was announced that the voting age was likely to be reduced from 18 to 16 for the Scottish independence referendum. This was approved by the Scottish Parliament in June 2013.

In June 2015, the Scottish Parliament voted unanimously to reduce the voting age to 16 for elections for the Scottish Parliament and for Scottish local government elections. The voting age in Scotland remains 18 for UK general elections.

==== Wales ====
Major reforms were recommended in 2017 in the &#x27;A Parliament That Works For Wales&#x27; report, by the expert panel on Assembly Electoral Reform led by Professor Laura McAllister. It included increasing the size of the Assembly, adapting or changing the electoral system and of course reducing the age of voting to 16.

The Welsh Assembly&#x27;s Commission, the corporate body, introduced a bill in 2019 to reduce the voting age to 16 and change the name to Senedd. The National Assembly for Wales passed the Senedd and Election (Wales) Act later that year. A vote to remove this enfranchisement was defeated by 41 votes to 11. The first election to include the biggest enfranchisement in Welsh politics since 1969 was the 2021 Senedd election.

The Welsh Government also legislated for the enfranchisement of 16 and 17-year-olds in the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act, which received royal assent in 2021. The changes were in place for local Welsh elections in 2022. The voting age in Wales remains 18 for UK general elections.

==== British Overseas Territories ====
The voting age in the British Overseas Territories (those parts of the British Realm that lie outside the archipelago of the British Isles, which, before 1983, were termed &quot;British colonies&quot;, and, from 1983 to 2002, &quot;British Dependent Territories&quot;) for the national (ie, &quot;British&quot;) Parliamentary elections is the same as in that part of the realm that lies within the British Isles, although - as no electoral district has ever been created for any British Overseas Territory, British nationals from the territories must first establish residency in an existing electoral district in order to exercise their voting rights in national elections. Local elected legislatures were established in Virginia in 1619 and Bermuda (originally settled as part of Virginia) in 1620. Sovereignty remained with the national (British) government, with the British Parliament asserting its right to legislate for the colonies, though in practice certain competencies were delegated by the British government to the local governments (varying depending upon the degree of representation in the local government of each colony). Since the 1960s, most of the remaining colonies have been given elected legislatures similar to Bermuda&#x27;s (or the Councils that advise the appointed governors, originally made up only of appointees, now include elected members), with the enfranchisement for local elections determined by local legislation (subject, like all local legislation, to the approval of the national government). In Anguilla, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Montserrat, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena (and presumably Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha), and Turks and Caicos Islands the current voting ages for local elections are all 18. There are no permanent inhabitants, and no local legislatures in British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory, and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. Under the agreement with Cyprus by which Britain retained the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, the British government agreed not to set up and administer &quot;colonies&quot; and not to allow new settlement of people in the Sovereign Base Areas other than for temporary purposes. There is no local legislature and consequently there are no local elections.

==== Crown Dependencies ====
As of 2025, the voting age in all British Crown Dependencies is now set at 16.

Moves to lower the voting age to 16 were first successful in three British Crown dependencies from 2006 to 2008. The Isle of Man was the first to amend previous legislation in 2006, when it reduced the voting age to 16 for its general elections, with the House of Keys approving the move by 19 votes to 4.

Jersey followed suit in 2007, when it approved a reduction of the voting age to 16. The States of Jersey voted narrowly in favour, by 25 votes to 21, and the legislative amendments were adopted. The law was sanctioned by Order in Council, and was brought into force in time for the general elections in late 2008.

In 2007, a proposal for a reduction (in voting age to 16) made by the House Committee of the States of Guernsey, and approved by the States&#x27; Policy Committee, was adopted by the assembly by 30 votes to 15. An Order in Council sanctioned the law, and it was registered at the Court of Guernsey. It came into force immediately, and the voting age was accordingly reduced in time for the 2008 Guernsey general election.

In 2022, both Alderney and Sark passed legislation which lowered the voting age to 16 for all elections going forward.

=== United States ===
In the United States, the debate about lowering the voting age from 21 to 18 began during World War II and intensified during the Vietnam War, when most of those subjected to the draft were too young to vote, and the image of young men being forced to risk their lives in the military without the privileges of voting successfully pressured legislators to lower the voting age nationally and in many states. By 1968, several states had lowered the voting age below 21 years: Alaska and Hawaii&#x27;s minimum age was 20, while Georgia and Kentucky&#x27;s was 18. In 1970, the Supreme Court in &quot;Oregon v. Mitchell&quot; ruled that Congress had the right to regulate the minimum voting age in federal elections; however, it decided it could not regulate it at local and state level.

The Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution (passed and ratified in 1971) prevents states from setting a voting age higher than 18. Except for the express limitations provided for in Amendments XIV, XV, XIX and XXVI, voter qualifications for House and Senate elections are largely delegated to the States under Article I, Section 2 and Amendment XVII of the United States Constitution, which respectively state that &quot;The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and &quot;the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature&quot;.&quot; and &quot;The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, elected by the people thereof, for six years; and each Senator shall have one vote. The &quot;electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the State legislatures&quot;.&quot;

Seventeen states permit 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections and caucuses if they will be 18 by election day: Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Virginia, Vermont, and West Virginia. Iowa, Minnesota, and Nevada allow 17-year-olds to participate in all presidential caucuses, but may not vote in primary elections for other offices. Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Washington, and Wyoming allow 17-year-olds to participate in only Democratic caucuses, but not in the Republican caucus.

All states allow someone not yet 18 to preregister to vote. Fifteen states — California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Virginia, and Washington — and Washington, D.C., allow 16-year-olds to preregister. In Maine, Nevada, New Jersey, and West Virginia, 17-year-olds can preregister. Alaska allows a teen to preregister within 90 days of their 18th birthday. Georgia, Iowa, and Missouri allow 17.5-year-olds to preregister if they turn 18 before the next election. Texas allows someone 17 year and 10 months old to preregister. The remaining states, excepting North Dakota, do not specify an age for preregistration so long as the teen will be 18 by the next election (usually the next general election). North Dakota does not require voter registration.

On 3 April 2019, Andrew Yang became the first major presidential candidate to advocate for the United States to lower its voting age to 16. At 16, Americans do not have hourly limits imposed on their work, and they pay taxes. According to Yang, their livelihoods are directly impacted by legislation, and they should therefore be allowed to vote for their representatives.

In 2018, a bill in the Council of the District of Columbia was proposed to lower the voting age to 16, which would make the federal district the first jurisdiction to lower the voting age for federal level elections. In 2019, Washington D.C., Council Member Charles Allen sponsored a debate on whether or not the city should lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, including the presidential election in the city. Allen gained a magnitude of public support although the measure to lower the age of voting stalled.

==== Youth voting at the local level ====
In 2013, the City of Takoma Park, Maryland, became the first place in the United States to lower its voting age to 16 for municipal elections and referendums. , Greenbelt, Hyattsville, Riverdale Park, Mount Rainier, Somerset and Chevy Chase had followed suit.

Starting in 2024, 16 and 17-year-olds can vote on School Board races in Berkeley, Oakland and Newark. 

In Massachusetts, the state has blocked efforts to lower the voting age for local elections to 16 in Ashfield, Boston, Brookline, Cambridge, Concord, Harwich, Lowell, Northampton, Shelburne, Somerville, and Wendell.
==== Debate on increasing the voting age ====
During the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries, Vivek Ramaswamy announced that he favored raising the voting age to 25 in most circumstances. The policy change, which would have to be done through a constitutional amendment, would only allow for citizens between 18 and 24 to vote if they are enlisted in the military, work as first-responder personnel, or pass a civics test.

=== Venezuela ===
A request to lower the voting age to 16 was made during consideration of revisions to the Constitution of Venezuela in 2007. Cilia Flores, president of the National Assembly, announced that the Mixed Committee for Constitutional Reform had found the idea acceptable. Following approval in the legislature the amendment formed part of the package of constitutional proposals, and was defeated in the 2007 referendum.

==Maximum voting age==
There are occasional calls for a maximum voting age, on the grounds that older people have less of a stake in the future of the country or jurisdiction. In fact, however, the only jurisdiction with a maximum voting age is the Vatican City State whose sovereign, (the Pope) is elected by the College of Cardinals. A Cardinal must be below the age of 80 on the date of the previous Pope&#x27;s death or resignation, in order to vote to elect a new Pope.

==List by country==
18 is the most common voting age. In some countries and territories 16 or 17 year-olds can vote in at least some elections. Examples of places with full enfranchisement for those aged 16 or 17 include Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, East Timor, Greece, and Indonesia.

The only known maximum voting age is in the Holy See, where the franchise for electing a new Pope in the Papal Conclave is restricted to Cardinals under the age of 80.
The following is an alphabetical list of voting ages in the various countries and territories of the world.

<doc id="630525" wikidata="Q707225" url="?curid=630525" title="Retief Goosen">
<text>Retief Goosen (born 3 February 1969) is a South African professional golfer who plays on the PGA Tour Champions. He has won two U.S. Opens, in 2001 and 2004, headed the European Tour Order of Merit in 2001 and 2002, and was in the top ten of the world rankings for over 250 weeks between 2001 and 2007. He was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame, class of 2019.

== Early life ==
Goosen was born in Pietersburg (now Polokwane), South Africa. He is the son of Theo Goosen, a local real estate agent and amateur golfer who introduced the game of golf to Retief at an early age. Theo took a strict approach to parenting. &quot;Look, I never made life easy for my kids,&quot; said Theo. &quot;We never spoiled them. We never pleasurized them.&quot; Goosen admits that his father put pressure on him.

In 1987, Goosen was struck by lightning. He was golfing with his friend, Henri Potgieter, at Pietersburg Golf Club. They were playing through a small drizzle when lightning struck Goosen. Potgieter was knocked from his feet and when he stood back up saw Retief lying on the ground on his back. Potgieter retold the story to &quot;Golf World,&quot; &quot;I wanted to know his reaction. What I did see was his golf clubs and his golf bag. Then I saw him lying on his back. His tongue was down his throat and his eyes were backward, and he was breathing weird. He had no clothes on; they&#x27;d been burned from his body. I remember picking up his spectacles. I didn&#x27;t know what to do. It looked like he was dead. I was screaming for help. Fortunately, there were guys teeing off on the 12th hole. They came running toward us. From then on, I can&#x27;t remember much. They picked him up and put him in a car.&quot; Goosen&#x27;s shoes had disintegrated from his feet, his underwear and watch band had melted to his body. He retains a scar on his wrist from the incident. He was unable to put his shoes on for weeks afterwards. He recovered enough to grab another set of clubs and take up the game a few weeks later. Goosen doesn&#x27;t remember the events that happened, but his father took his son&#x27;s survival as a sign from God of good things to come.

==Amateur career==
In 1990, Goosen won the South African Amateur Championship, the leading amateur competition in his country.

== Professional career ==

=== Southern Africa Tour ===
In 1990, Goosen turned professional.

=== European Tour ===
Gossen was medalist at the European Tour&#x27;s Qualifying School in 1992 and enjoyed success on the Tour between 1992 and 2000, but it was not until 2001 that he made his name in America with a U.S. Open win on a very tough Southern Hills Country Club golf course. He nearly lost his chance at victory after three putting from 12 feet, missing a two foot putt on the final green, but managed to recover to make a playoff with the 1996 PGA Championship winner Mark Brooks. Goosen dominated the next day&#x27;s 18-hole playoff, eventually winning by two strokes. Later that summer, he completed his second wire-to-wire victory of the year at The Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. He finished 2001 with three wins, 11 top-tens and the European Tour Order of Merit and followed it up with another in 2002. He also became the first non-European to win the Order of Merit. After his third win of the 2001 season, he rose to a career-high 11th in the world rankings. In 2002, he won on both the PGA Tour and European Tour for the second straight year, a feat that would be repeated for three more years. He won a second U.S. Open in 2004, where he had 11 one-putts in the final round at a tough test at Shinnecock Hills Golf Club. He then rose to his career high world ranking position of 3rd. He won on the PGA Tour each year from 2001 to 2005 with six wins, and he added a seventh win in March 2009 at the Transitions Championship.

After winning medalist at the European Tour&#x27;s Q-School in 1992, Goosen played 3 seasons before winning his first event in 1996 at the Slaley Hall Northumberland Challenge. He won the Alfred Dunhill Cup in 1997 and 1998 with Ernie Els and David Frost. Goosen played in the 2000 Presidents Cup where the U.S. team won, but Goosen scored 2 points in total in his 1st appearance in the event. Goosen won four times on the European Tour between 1996 and 2000, before his breakthrough year in the United States with his 2001 U.S. Open win. Two weeks after the U.S. Open win of 2001, Goosen won on the European Tour at The Scottish Open at Loch Lomond. This win secured Goosen the Player of the Month for June 2001 on the European Tour. He added another win late in the year and won the European Tour Order of Merit and the Player of the Year on the European Tour.

=== PGA Tour ===
Goosen was in contention in the U.S. Open at Southern Hills Country Club in 2001 all week, and battled Mark Brooks and Stewart Cink during the final round. After Brooks had posted 4 under par, and Goosen was at 5 under coming up 18, Cink had a chance to win until he three-putted the 71st hole, leaving the battle for the trophy a two-man race between Brooks and Goosen. After Goosen hit his approach to 12 feet on 18, he had 2 putts to win and victory seemed imminent. Goosen put his first putt past the hole and was left with 22 inches for victory, but pushed the second putt across the right edge of the cup and was forced to make a putt longer than the one previous to force a playoff with Brooks.

Goosen won the Monday 18-hole playoff by 2 strokes with an even-par 70 and Brooks shooting a 2-over-par 72. It was Goosen&#x27;s first victory on U.S. soil. He finished 47th on the PGA Tour money list with over $1,047,000 in a restricted season shared between the PGA and European Tours.

Goosen won the European Tour Order of Merit for a second straight year for a season that included a win at the Johnnie Walker Classic by a margin of 8 strokes. He had eight other top-10s on the season, two runner-up finishes, including a 2nd place to Tiger Woods at The Masters. Goosen won the money title in the end by a slim margin over Northern Ireland&#x27;s Darren Clarke. Goosen also had his second win in the U.S. at the BellSouth Classic in April on the PGA Tour.

In 2003, Goosen won his second Trophee Lancome title in its final playing. It was his lone win on the European Tour in 2003, though he had five other top-10s on the season. 2003 was the first season where he played most of his events in the United States. He picked up his 3rd tour win at the Chrysler Championship in October. His 2003 season included 17 of 19 cuts made, 9 top-10s, a win and over $3,100,000 in earnings. Goosen played in the Presidents Cup for the International team where he scored 3 points for the week that ended with a tie because Tiger Woods and Ernie Els were involved in a playoff that was not over at sundown, so captains Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus decided that the 2003 matches would be a draw.

Goosen&#x27;s second major title came at the 2004 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills. The USGA had prepared extremely tough conditions which were later argued by players as &quot;unfair.&quot; The final-round scoring average of 78.7 was the second-highest since World War II, with only Goosen and Phil Mickelson finishing under par. He eventually won by two strokes over Mickelson as both men shot 1-over-par rounds of 71. Goosen had 11 one-putt greens on Sunday and 31 one-putts for the championship. He only needed 24 putts on the day in what is remembered as one of the most clutch putting performances in U.S. Open history. 2004 was the start of the &quot;Big Five Era&quot; which is used in describing the era in golf where Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh, Ernie Els, Retief Goosen, and Phil Mickelson dominated the game of golf. The five switched up and down the top five positions in the Official World Golf Ranking; most notably Singh&#x27;s derailing of Woods as the number one golfer in the world. The five stayed, for the most part in the top five spots from 2004 till the start of 2007. Nine majors were won between them many fighting against each other head to head.

Goosen won the Tour Championship in November 2004, coming from four strokes behind on the final round with a 6-under-par 64 to win by four strokes over Tiger Woods. It was his second Tour win on the season and it secured him a career high 6th-place finish on the 2004 money list.

In 2005 Goosen was in pursuit of his third U.S. Open and his second in a row, leading by three strokes after three rounds of golf at the Pinehurst No. 2 course. However, he disappeared in the final round with a score of 81 and he ended up finishing in 11th place. In an interview after his round Goosen said &quot;I messed up badly. I obviously threw this one away.&quot;

Even though Goosen finished T-11 in the U.S. Open in 2005, it was his worst finish in a major in 2005, he won The International by one point over Brandt Jobe for his 6th career win. His 2005 season included 8 top 10s, and over $3.4 million in earnings. Goosen played in his 3rd Presidents Cup in 2005, at an event where he defeated Tiger Woods in Sunday&#x27;s singles matches and finished with 4 points. The final score was 18½–15½ for the United States.

Goosen has been a consistent player: he has won internationally every year since 1995, and also won a PGA Tour event every year from 2001 to 2005. Additionally, he has spent a long period of time in the top 5 of the Official World Golf Ranking, and in 2006 reached a career-best third place after a runner-up finish at The Players Championship to Stephen Ames and 5 other top 10s on the season. He also won on the European Tour at the South African Airways Open and at the Volkswagen Masters-China on the Asian Tour. He also won his match during the challenge season at the People vs. The Pros event. But from early 2007 to late 2008 he had had a dip in performance.

2007 was an average season for Goosen&#x27;s standards; a victory at the Qatar Masters in January – when he finished birdie-eagle for the win, looked to be a sign of things to come along with being the European Tour player of the month in January. Goosen posed a threat on the final day at The Masters. He held the lead till a bogey on the par-three twelve, Goosen failed to rebound parring each of his six remaining holes. He finished tied for second, two behind Zach Johnson. However, after the Masters Goosen&#x27;s best finish throughout the rest of the year was a tie for 15th at the BMW Asian Open, and he ended 2007 having slumped down to 26th in the world rankings.

Goosen&#x27;s statistics on the PGA Tour at this time were surprisingly low. He was outside the top 100 in ball striking, greens in regulation, driving accuracy, distance, and putting. But this was due mainly, Goosen said, to the swing changes he had made, his hiring a swing coach for the first time in his career, and how he had lost all confidence in his game.

He was again a part of the International team at the 2007 Presidents Cup at the Royal Montreal Golf Club, just outside Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was his fourth appearance in the event. He finished the week with 2 points, including a singles win of 2&amp;1 over Jim Furyk on Sunday.

At the start of 2008, Goosen withdrew from the Qatar Masters as defending champion due to problems with his vision after undergoing corrective laser surgery ten days before the tournament began. He was forced to return to his home in London, England, for further treatment. In March, he showed a form that had left him for almost a year and resulted in a tie for second at the WGC-CA Championship. He putted exceptionally well thanks to his old &quot;Yes!&quot; putter he won both his U.S. Open titles with and named &quot;Tracy&quot; after his wife. 
Before the tournament Goosen was ranked 40th in the world, which was the lowest he had been ranked since 10 June 2001 (a week before the U.S. Open). His best finish in 2009 other than the runner-up at the WGC-CA Championship, was at the other stroke play WGC event, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, where he finished T4, two strokes behind winner Vijay Singh. It was his second of two top five finishes on the season. Although showing some signs of his old self, Goosen had a very inconsistent year finishing 72nd on the PGA Tour money list. In June 2008, he made controversial comments about fellow golfer Tiger Woods, alleging that Woods was faking the severity of his injuries at the 2008 U.S. Open. Goosen apologized for the comments saying he was not being serious when he made the claim.

His game was on the rise in late 2008. Late in the 2008 season Goosen replaced Vijay Singh because of injury in the Asian Tour&#x27;s Iskandar Johor Open. Goosen won the tournament for his only win of 2008. The win also extended his streak of winning a professional golf event every year since 1995.

Goosen continued his good form from late 2008 into 2009. With two international wins in three months, it was a sign of good form to come throughout the season.

He started his 2009 season with two wins on two major tours. Goosen won his second event in four worldwide starts on the Sunshine Tour, at the Africa Open in January, where he came from behind with a final round 65 on Sunday to win by one stroke over four players and take the trophy. Goosen said he&#x27;d been struggling with his putting for the last few seasons, he put a belly putter in his bag for a few weeks to &quot;get his stroke back&quot;. He played with it for 3 weeks in January and February, starting at the Buick Invitational. He played well with it at the AT&amp;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, where he was the 36-hole leader. He went on to finish 3rd for the rained-out 54-hole event. He then won his seventh PGA Tour title at the Transitions Championship in March 2009. He made only five bogeys all week on the tough Copperhead Course at Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Florida. He shot all four rounds under par, and finished at −8, to win by one stroke over Charles Howell III and Brett Quigley. His putting was exceptional during that week, making 55 of 55 putts from 5 feet and less, including a -foot putt for par on 18 for the win that fell in the left edge of the cup. Goosen credited Gary Player with inspiring him to rededicate himself to a new diet and fitness program. This win vaulted Goosen to number 22 in the Official World Golf Ranking, his highest position since November 2007.

With his rededication to his game with his work with his swing coach, his newfound fitness regime and his renewed, refreshed sense of confidence, Goosen dramatically improved his statistics in 2009 from those of the 2007–2008 seasons before. He moved from driving distance from outside the top 100 to 82nd, to inside the top 40 in putting, 20th in scoring average and 49th in the all-around statistic.

After a tie for 16th place at the U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, Goosen was in contention the very next week in Munich, Germany at the BMW International Open. He led after the first three rounds at 17 under par, two ahead of Bernhard Langer and three ahead of Nick Dougherty. On Sunday, Goosen did not putt as well as he did the first three rounds, only managing a 1-under 71. He finished the week in 3rd, four strokes behind eventual winner Dougherty.

After a week off, Goosen was in contention the week before The Open Championship at the Barclays Scottish Open at Loch Lomond Golf Club in Glasgow. After a first round of 3-under par 68, he shot a second round 63, which was started by an un-Goosen like opening tee shot. He pulled out a 3-wood off the first tee, and barely got the ball airborne as Goosen topped it and put it in the right rough, as a couple of grouse scuttled for cover. But Goosen shot a second round 63 to pull two clear of Adam Scott after two rounds. He shot a disappointing final round of 73 to finish in a tie for 6th.

Goosen added a 3rd top-10 finish in as many starts worldwide at the 2009 Open Championship at Turnberry. He contended for most of the week and had a share of the lead momentarily during the 3rd round. He finished the event in a tie for 5th, 2 strokes out of the playoff between Stewart Cink and Tom Watson. Goosen almost picked up his second PGA Tour win of the season at the RBC Canadian Open the following week. Goosen faced Nathan Green in a playoff after the two players shot −18 after four rounds of play. Goosen had a six-foot birdie putt to win the tournament on the first playoff hole but missed it. Green had a twelve-foot birdie putt to win the tournament on the second hole and missed it but it did not matter. Goosen had to sink a nine-foot par putt to extend the playoff but he missed it, giving Green his first PGA Tour victory.

Goosen had another close call at victory during the 2009 FedEx Cup Playoffs at the Deutsche Bank Championship, where he was the 54-hole co-leader with Sean O&#x27;Hair and Steve Stricker, but he shot a final round of Even Par to finish T8.

Goosen added 4 consecutive top 10 finishes in October and November; 6th at the Portugal Masters, 3rd at the Iskandar Johor Open, where he shot a third round 62, 9th at the Volvo World Match Play Championship and 10th at the WGC-HSBC Champions.

Goosen started his 2010 campaign in January with 3 consecutive top-10 finishes. He finished 6th at the SBS Championship, 4th at the Sony Open in Hawaii and 9th at the Qatar Masters. Goosen added a quarterfinal loss to Camilo Villegas in February at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship, his best appearance in the event since 2006. Goosen had a good title defense at the Transitions Championship in March, where he finished 5th. A week later at the Arnold Palmer Invitational, Goosen finished in a tie for 4th, his fifth top-10 in seven 2010 PGA Tour events, and his 11th top-10 finish in his last 14 events worldwide. The 4th-place finish moved Goosen to 15th in the Official World Golf Ranking.

On 27 April 2010, Goosen broke his toe while playing with his children. /The injury caused Goosen to miss the Quail Hollow Championship and The Players Championship. On 18 May, in an incident separate to his toe injury, Goosen injured his hand. This injury caused Goosen to miss the BMW PGA Championship, one of the premier events on the European Tour. Goosen returned to the PGA Tour in June at the St. Jude Classic, the week before the U.S. Open. He finished T15 at the St. Jude Classic. After the U.S. Open, Goosen flew to Canada to play in the Telus World Skins Game, where he won 5 skins. Two days after that, he played in the Travelers Championship, where he finished T5, his 6th top-10 finish of the season.

At the 2010 Open Championship at St Andrews, Goosen finished 6th, breaking par in all four rounds. It was Goosen&#x27;s 7th top-10 finish of the season. Goosen had his first top-3 finish of the season in August at the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational, his 8th top-10 of the season.

After a 7th-place finish at the BMW Championship, Goosen played in the final group on Sunday at The Tour Championship with eventual winner Jim Furyk. Goosen finished 3rd on his own. Goosen finished 10th in the final standings of the 2010 FedEx Cup Playoffs. He finished his 2010 PGA Tour season with 10 top-10s, and over $3.2 million in earnings.
In December, Goosen finished runner-up to Ernie Els at the South African Open in Durban. Goosen finished at 24 under par, one stroke behind Els.

Despite a strong start to the season, with two top-3 finishes by January, Goosen ended the year with his worst season since 1995. Goosen withdrew from both The Open Championship and the PGA Championship after poor first rounds, citing injuries. Goosen had to deal with back injuries for the entire second half of the 2011 season. At the end of the year, he had dropped out of the top 50 in the world rankings for the first time in over a decade.

Goosen started his 2012 campaign on the European Tour with three consecutive starts in January in South Africa. He finished 3rd in the Africa Open, and 16th in the Joburg Open before finishing tied second with Ernie Els in the Volvo Golf Champions, losing to winner Branden Grace in a playoff. Through the first three weeks of season, Goosen was second in the Race to Dubai.

For the first time since 1999, Goosen did not play in the Masters, as he was outside the Top 50 in the OWGR.

Goosen started his 2013 campaign internationally, finishing 20th at the Volvo Golf Champions and missing the cut at the Qatar Masters. Goosen made 9 starts on the PGA tour making 6 cuts, including 9th at AT&amp;T National. He re-injured his back at The Players Championship, causing him to withdraw from the tournament. After months of time off, Goosen returned to action on the European Tour in September for two tournaments, finishing 63rd and 66th.

Goosen showed hopeful signs during the 2013–14 season. Focused only on the PGA Tour, Goosen made 19 of the 26 cuts, including 14 straight cuts to finish the season, while earning over $825k.

Goosen started off the 2014–15 PGA Tour season with a 3rd-place finish at the Frys.com Open. Goosen finished 2014 making 2 out of 3 cuts, finishing 33rd at the CIMB Classic and 65th at the OHL Classic. He held the lead at the 2015 Northern Trust Open for the first three rounds. A final round 75 dropped him to a tie for 8th finish. He was able to qualify for the U.S. Open via a local qualifying tournament, but missed the cut. He continued to compete in several tournaments. After firing an opening round of 66 (−6) at the 2015 Open Championship to place him into second place, he stayed in the top 10 for the first three rounds, but a final round 74 saw him fall into a 20th place. Two weeks later at the Quicken Loans National tournament, he took the 18-hole lead after an opening round −8, 63. But he stalled the final three rounds and finished 46th.

===Champions Tour===
In 2019, Goosen turned 50, started playing on the PGA Tour Champions and was elected to the World Golf Hall of Fame. On 14 July 2019, Goosen won his first title on the PGA Tour Champions. It was a major tournament, the Bridgestone Senior Players Championship. In the final round, Goosen birdied the final two holes at Firestone Country Club in Akron, Ohio, to win by two strokes over Jay Haas and Tim Petrovic. Because of issues with lockdowns, he was not invited to the next &quot;subsequent official&quot; playing of the Players Championship, as is normally offered.

On 15 January 2020, Goosen received the PGA Tour Champions Rookie of the Year for 2019. In March 2022, Goosen won the Hoag Classic on PGA Tour Champions in Newport Beach, California.

==Personal life==
Goosen has the nickname &quot;The Iceman&quot; on the PGA Tour, because of his calm demeanour. He is also called &quot;The Goose.&quot; Goosen&#x27;s mother attributes her son&#x27;s calm demeanour to the effects left on Goosen after he was struck by lightning.

Retief has played in the Nelson Mandela Invitational hosted by Gary Player in South Africa, honoring former South African President Nelson Mandela. He has won the event twice, in betterball in 2000 with Allan Henning, and in 2006 with Bobby Lincoln. He also won the fourball event in 2008 with Costantino Rocca, and Alan Pearson.

Goosen owns his own vineyard in Garden Route, South Africa. The vineyard is situated 2500 feet above sea level and was deemed a great place to plant in 1993. He started growing plants on the vineyard in 2005, and labelled his wine &quot;The Goose&quot;. The Goose Expression Cabernet Sauvignon Shiraz wine won the bronze medal in 2008 from the Decanter World Wide Wine. In 2009, Goosen won awards for both his &quot;Goose&quot; wines. This follows on from last year&#x27;s bronze medal for The Expression Cabernet Sauvignon / Shiraz 2005. 2009 brought a Silver Medal each by The Decanter World Wine Award 2009 for The Expression Cabernet Sauvignon / Shiraz 2007 and The Goose Sauvignon Blanc 2008.

<doc id="630526" wikidata="Q5030767" url="?curid=630526" title="Canadian electoral system">
<text>The Canadian electoral system is based on a parliamentary system of government modelled on that of the United Kingdom.

== Federal parliament ==
The Parliament of Canada consists of:
*The sovereign (represented by the governor general)
*An upper house (the Senate), the members of which are appointed by the governor general on the recommendation of the prime minister
*A lower house (the House of Commons), the members of which are chosen by the citizens of Canada through federal general elections.

Elections Canada is the non-partisan agency responsible for the conduct of elections in Canada, including federal elections, by-elections and referendums. It is headed by the chief electoral officer.

===Representation in the House of Commons===
Representation in the House of Commons is based on electoral districts, also known as constituencies or ridings. Each riding elects one member to the House of Commons, and the number of ridings is established through a formula set out in the Constitution of Canada.

Riding boundaries are established by independent commissions, and take into account:
*population
*social links
*economic links

New commissions are set up every ten years to make any necessary revisions to existing boundaries, following criteria defined in the &quot;Electoral Boundaries Readjustment Act&quot;. The process of redefining electoral boundaries is called &quot;redistribution&quot;, and the results are recorded in a &quot;representation order&quot;. The &quot;Representation Order of 2003&quot; set the number of ridings at 308. The 2012 redistribution set the number of ridings to 338.

==Electoral method==

=== Single-member plurality ===
Canada&#x27;s electoral system is a &quot;first-past-the-post&quot; system, which is formally referred to as a single-member plurality system. The candidate who receives the most votes in a riding, even if not a majority of the votes, wins a seat in the House of Commons and represents that riding as its member of Parliament (MP). When a party wins a majority of seats, the governor general asks the party leader to form a government; that leader becomes prime minister. When no party attains a majority, the current prime minister may resign immediately, or choose to stay in office and attempt to win the confidence of a majority of the House. If they resign (either immediately or following a vote of no confidence), the governor general will invite the leader of the opposition party most likely to enjoy the confidence of the House to form a government. The largest party by seat count that is not the government or part of a governing coalition becomes the Official Opposition. That party receives more finances and prestige than the other opposition parties.

An absolute majority of the votes cast in the last election is not needed to have power, and is rarely achieved. As well, the party in power does not need to have a majority of seats in the House of Commons and under the current multi-party system, quite often does not have that. However to pass bills, the governing party must have support of a majority of MPs. Without majority support, the government falls and a new party is named government or an election has to be held. Only the Liberals and Conservatives (the original Conservative Party of Canada, Progressive Conservatives and modern Conservatives) have formed the federal government in Canada.

=== Turnout ===

Voter turnout fell dramatically between 1962 (79%) and 2011 (61.4%). The Gallagher Index of disproportionality for Canadian federal elections in that period has ranged from 6.26 to 20.91, in line with some of its comparables — Australia, New Zealand (prior to adoption of MMP in 1992) and United States (presidential electoral college), but significantly higher than many others, for example Belgium, Germany, Ireland, United States (House) and the Scandinavian countries.

Voter turnout rose higher in 2015 to 68.5%, and to 66% in 2019.

=== Timing of election ===
Historically, the prime minister could ask the governor general to call an election at virtually any time, although one had to be called no later than five years after the return of the writs under section 4 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. In 2007, the Conservative Parliament passed an act requiring fixed election dates in Canada every four years. This law does not curtail the power of the governor general to dissolve Parliament at any time, as was done for the 2008 election at the request of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

If a government loses a confidence motion, traditionally the prime minister will ask the governor general to call an election. The governor general when approached by the prime minister who has lost a vote of confidence will traditionally call an election. However, it is not assured as some assume. The governor general also has the right to call the leader of the party they think would be most likely to be able to form a government and ask them if they can form the government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the King-Byng Affair.

=== Running for office ===

Any number of candidates may run for election in an electoral district, but each candidate may only run in one district, either independently or under the banner of a political party. Each party may endorse only one candidate per riding. Candidates who run for election without party affiliation may be designated as independent or as having no affiliation.

A political party is a group of people who together:
* Establish a constitution and by-laws
* Elect a leader and other officers
* Endorse candidates for election to the House of Commons.

To obtain the right to put the party name on the ballot, under the names of the candidates it endorses, a political party must register with the chief electoral officer. , there were 22 registered political parties operating at the federal level in Canada.

=== Governing party ===
After an election, the party with the most elected representatives usually becomes the governing party. The leader of this party is then summoned by the governor-general and sworn in as Prime Minister of Canada shortly after the election concludes. The party with the second largest number of MPs is called the Official Opposition. Each of the elected candidates has a seat in the House of Commons, where they debate and vote on draft legislation (called bills) and thus attempt to have an influence on government policy. A party having a majority of the seats can pass what it wants despite any opposition from the group(s) holding the minority of seats, but the imperative to be re-elected and any moral pressure the opposition can impose may temper its legislative agenda

==Right to vote==
All citizens (18 years and older) have the right to a voice in choosing their parliamentary representatives. Canada&#x27;s electoral law requires the chief electoral officer to inform the public about the system and about individual rights under that system and to remove obstacles that may make voting difficult for some.

=== Information to voter ===
During an election, Elections Canada informs Canadians about their right to vote, how to get on the National Register of Electors and the voter&#x27;s list, and where and how they can vote. Its public information activities include
*News releases.
*Advertisements in newspapers and on television and radio, brochures, posters.
*A toll-free telephone inquiries center.
*A website.
*Meetings with community and ethnocultural groups.

Between elections, the agency publishes additional background information for the public, keeps its telephone enquiries centre and website open to answer questions, and works with educators to encourage young people to vote when they become eligible (18 years and older).

=== Voting accommodations ===
Helping to remove obstacles to voting is an important part of Elections Canada&#x27;s work. Voters who are not able to vote on polling day can vote at the advance polls. A mail-in special ballot is available for Canadians who are away from their ridings, travelling or temporarily resident overseas. Even Canadians in their own ridings during the election period may use the special ballot if they do not wish to go to a polling station. In special cases, electors with a disability may vote at home, in the presence of an election officer. Mobile polls serve voters living in certain institutions, such as nursing homes for people who are elderly or who have a disability.

Wherever possible, election officers at polling stations speak both official languages (English and French). In addition, a deputy returning officer can appoint and swear in an interpreter to help communicate with a voter.

All votes are made on the same standard heavy paper ballot, which is inserted in a standard cardboard box, furnished by Elections Canada. The ballot and the box are devised to ensure that no one except the elector knows the individual choice that was made.

==Voting reform==

In 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was in favour of adopting a single-winner ranked voting system, also referred to as instant-runoff voting or preferential voting.

Trudeau promised electoral reform in the 2015 campaign but was unable to get a consensus with other political parties. He said he could not implement electoral reform, saying all parties were not in agreement. Each party had different suggestions, one or more even wanting to retain first-past-the-post. Very few government proposals have approval of every political party represented in the House of Commons.

<text>A swing vote is a vote that is seen as potentially going to any one of a number of candidates in an election, or, in a two-party system, may go to either of the two dominant political parties. It usually comes from voters who are &#x27;undecided&#x27; or who may change their preferences between candidates or parties. Such votes are usually sought after in election campaigns, since they can play a big role in determining the outcome.

A swing voter or floating voter is a voter who may not be affiliated with a particular political party (Independent) or who will vote across party lines. In USA politics, many centrists, liberal Republicans, and conservative Democrats are considered &quot;swing voters&quot; since their voting patterns cannot be predicted as easily as voters in &#x27;safe seat&#x27; voters.

While the swing voter is ostensibly the target of most political activity during elections, another factor is the success of each party in rallying its core support. In a two-party system, those who become disillusioned with their once-favoured party are more likely to vote for a third-party or abstain than cross over. 

Smaller groups that use voting to decide matters, such as chambers of parliament and supreme courts, can also have swing voters. The smaller the group, the more power swing voters can have. For example, on a court of nine judges (as there is in the SCOTUS) of which four are committed to each side of a case, the ninth judge may be seen as single-handedly deciding the case.

== Impact on campaigning ==
Swing Vote can have a very broad meaning and has been used in many different contexts by different media and news outlets. One definition is someone who has not yet made up their mind on how they will be voting. These voters can be easily persuaded and are cross pressured. If some voters are firm, clear, dependable supporters of one candidate or the other, swing voters are the opposite: those whose final allegiance is in some doubt all the way up until election day. This is particularly significant when considering where political parties choose to focus their campaigning efforts. The voters who can be convinced are the voters that receive the most attention because campaigns will not bother to engage the voters they know will show up to the polls and support them. In the state of New York, voters almost always vote Democrat so the Democratic and Republican candidates do not spend much campaign time there as their is little chance the outcome will change. 

Whether swing voters actually exist is a point of contention. Prior to an election, some voters may claim to be &quot;swing voters&quot;, open to the idea of changing their vote. But in reality, they are not as &quot;undecided&quot; as they may claim. They have pre-existing biases and history that almost always draws them to one political side or the other.

Focusing only on the undecided voters instead of all voters at large is a core part of almost all political campaigns. With this framework in mind, the idea of a swing vote can closely tie with the concept of swing states. Swing/Battleground states are states that neither party can guarantee will go in their favour. These are the states that politicians will most likely focus their time to maximize their reach, in the same way that there is a focus on swing voters. Identifying battleground states is much easier than identifying individual swing votes.[&quot;}&quot;

To some extent, it is unclear if a state truly is a &quot;swing state.&quot;  For decades Missouri was the ultimate &quot;swing&quot; state until 2004 when it &quot;swung&quot; from Democrat to Republican. Since then it has been reliably Republican in presidential elections. The same can be said for the state of Florida which was famously the deciding state in the 2000 presidential election, but in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections has become reliably Republican. Colorado and Virginia also went from &quot;swing states&quot; to reliably Democrat in recent presidential elections as well. 

With battleground states being essential in a potential close call in a future election, campaigns must balance their efforts, targeting persuadable voters while energizing their base to ensure high turnout. The 1960 election, where swing voters tipped the scales for Kennedy, demonstrates the importance of strategic resource allocation, prioritizing battleground areas where both groups can be influenced. However, swing voters often reinforce existing trends rather than decisively shifting outcomes, showing the need for campaigns to focus on broad appeal through national messaging and policies that resonate across demographics.

== Calculating a swing votes ==
Deciding who is a swing voter can be calculated by measuring how a voter feels about each of the candidates. The American National Election Studies (ANES) created a scale by asking how favourably they see each candidate from negative 100 to 100, with zero as neutral. Then, the two scores for the candidates are subtracted and the smaller the difference is, the more likely that the person is a swing voter. The answers are indicative of the voters voting behaviour and their ideological identification. The ANES also shows about the relationship between scale position and “convertibility”—the likelihood that a campaign can change a person’s vote intention. This method of measurement is also a good indication of how polarized the public already is. For example, in 2004, only 13% of the voters were considered swing voters which is low compared to previous elections.

==Profile==
In an election, there are &quot;certain&quot; or &quot;lock&quot; votes, voters who are solidly behind or partisan to a particular candidate and will not consider changing their minds whatever the opposition says. Swing voters are undecided about how they will vote. They are sometimes referred to as undecideds, undecided voters, or floating voter. Which is essentially respondents who tell pollsters that they do not know how they are going to vote in the upcoming election. 

They may be dissatisfied party members who are open to the idea of voting for other parties, or they could be officially registered as &quot;independents&quot; or simply people who have never had a strong affiliation with any political party and will vote depending on certain things such as valance factors with may influence them: healthcare, benefits, election campaign, etc.

Some, but not all, swing voters are considered to be &quot;low-information voters.&quot; Because the votes of swing voters are considered to be &quot;up for grabs,&quot; candidates direct a fair proportion of campaign effort towards them, but they must also be concerned with voter turnout among their political base. There is a perception that swing voters are primarily motivated by self-interest rather than values or ideology and so are particularly susceptible to pork barreling.

If a constituency contains a large proportion of swing voters it is often called a marginal seat and extensive campaign resources are poured into it.

==Demographics within the United States==

An April 2016 poll by the Progressive Policy Institute examined voters in the U.S. states considered &quot;battlegrounds&quot; in the upcoming presidential election (Florida, Ohio, Colorado and Nevada). Swing voters were slightly more likely to be women (52% women, 48% men) and slightly less likely to have a college degree (44%) than voters overall in these states (48%. By contrast, race was a significant determinant, especially for African-Americans. While 7% of poll respondents identified as African-American, only 2% of swing voters were African-American. Latinos (12% of poll respondents) were represented more proportionately (13% of swing voters).

&quot;Overall, white voters are likely to swing the outcome of a national election by an average of 10 percentage points—voting more Democratic in elections Democrats win and more Republican in elections Republicans win,&quot; according to a 2008 report by the Democratic Leadership Council. Most of this (6.7 of the 10 percentage points) is due to those white people who have only a high school education.

In mid-term and presidential elections from 1992 to 2014, people who self-identified as &quot;gay, lesbian, or bisexual&quot; voted consistently &quot;around 75% Democratic within a range of 67 to 81%.&quot; In the 2016 presidential election, people who identified as gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender cast 78% of their votes for the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Among people who identify as gay and bisexual, men&#x27;s support for Democratic candidates in the 1990s Congressional elections (held every two years from 1990 to 1998) was more consistent than women&#x27;s. Across these five elections, men&#x27;s support ranged from 67% to 75%, while women&#x27;s support ranged from 53% to 82%. This suggests that lesbian and bisexual women may be more likely swing voters, at least over time, if not necessarily for any given election. There are also differences by state: &quot;California GLB voters are more likely to identify as &#x27;Independent&#x27; than are GLB voters nationally, and therefore have a greater potential to play the role of a swing vote in a close election.&quot;

In the 2020 election, 30% of voters were considered swing voters. The swing votes in this election demographically were younger, ideologically moderate, disengaged in politics. Political apathy also plays a part in identifying swing voters. 24% of swing voters did not vote in the 2016 election and 22% did not vote in the 2018 election. 18-29 year olds were the age group that had the highest percentage of swing voters - there was about the same number of swing voters as there were &quot;decided voters&quot;. In the oldest age group of 65 and older, only 22% are considered swing voters. Another important data point from the 2020 election was that 39% of Swing Voters say they are paying &quot;a lot&quot; of attention to politics, compared to the 68% of decided voters that pay attention.

In the 2024 election, the Donald Trump political victory highlights how new voter groups can emerge that had been nearly unseen before. What now looks like a new group called &quot;Barstool Conservatives&quot; would have been seen prior to the election as &quot;swing voters&quot; given their youth which would imply liberalism but male gender which would imply conservatism. But the continuing relevance of Donald Trump in American politics through the 2024 election, and potentially the future, highlights how a hypothetical &quot;swing voter&quot; can become the base demographic of a candidate almost instantaneously. 

==Impact==
Swing voters occasionally play a huge part in elections. First-time voters and swing voters are usually credited for helping Jesse Ventura win the Minnesota gubernatorial election in 1998. Swing voters who support third-party candidates take potential votes away from the major candidates. Ventura was a third-party candidate; his opponents were seen as two weak major-party candidates, and this situation created many more swing voters than usual. This resulted in Jesse Ventura, the third-party candidate, winning the election.

In the Supreme Court of the United States the swing justice, if one exists, essentially decides the overall outcome of the ruling during a split, which can mean highly impacting landmark decisions. For example, the effective decision of the President of the United States in the 2000 election was ultimately made by Justice Anthony Kennedy in the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; case.

==Examples==
Common examples of swing voters include &quot;Reagan Democrats&quot; (Democrats who voted for Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980s) and &quot;Clinton Conservatives&quot; (Republicans who voted for Democrat Bill Clinton in the 1990s). In her 2012 book &quot;The Swing Vote&quot;, Linda Killian divides the American swing vote into 4 factions: NPR Republicans, America First Democrats, the Facebook Generation, and Starbucks Moms and Dads. On the Supreme Court of the United States, Associate Justices Potter Stewart, Byron White, Lewis F. Powell Jr., Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, Anthony Kennedy, and Chief Justice John Roberts have been described as swing votes between the two factions of the court. In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Essex man&quot;, &quot;Worcester woman&quot; and &quot;Holby City woman&quot; are examples of personifications of swing voters.

<text>Afonso Cláudio is a municipality in east central Espírito Santo, Brazil, founded in 1963. The town, at a height of 610m above sea level, has a population of approximately 30,455 and an area of 361.7 km2, and a population density of 32,53 inhabitants/km2. Its borders include: (E) Domingos Martins, Santa Maria de Jetibá and Itarana (N) Laranja da Terra and the neighbouring state of Minas Gerais, (W) Brejetuba (S) Conceição do Castelo and Venda Nova do Imigrante.

==History==
Afonso Cláudio first began to be populated in 1885, when Valentim Perozzini, an Italian immigrant, moved there. Now that place is called São Luis de Miranda. The mainly Italian immigration which took place in this area was indirect, in that people usually first came from the neighbouring localities of Alfredo Chaves, Castelo and Itaguaçu. The name of the municipality was given in honour of Afonso Cláudio de Freitas Rosa (born in Santa Leopoldina, Espírito Santo), the first governor of that state after the implantation of the Brazilian Republic on November 15, 1889.

<doc id="630537" wikidata="Q4020981" url="?curid=630537" title="Wormit">
<text>Wormit is a village on the south shore of the Firth of Tay in north-east Fife, Scotland. It is located at the southern end of the Tay Rail Bridge and together with Woodhaven and Newport-on-Tay, Wormit is a part of The Burgh of Newport-on-Tay. The name of the village is thought to be derived from the plant wormwood.

==Wormit Station==
Wormit Railway Station, opened on 1 May 1889 and closed on 5 May 1969, was operated on a closed branch line, The Newport Railway, which left the main line (Edinburgh/Dundee) railway immediately at the south end of the Bridge to serve Wormit/Newport. After closure, Wormit Station was later dismantled and rebuilt at the heritage Bo&#x27;ness &amp; Kinneil Railway to the west of Edinburgh.

In 1955, there was a serious train crash in Wormit Station in which three people were killed and forty-one were injured.

==Power==
Wormit claims to be the first Scottish village to have installed electricity. A windmill located on Wormit Hill generated the power, with a steam engine supplementing this when the wind was low. This was later replaced by a coal-gas engine until the 1930s, when Wormit was connected to the national grid. Alexander Stewart, who built many of Wormit&#x27;s early houses, owned the windmill and steam engine and offered electrical lighting to homeowners as well as basic street lighting. Consumers paid 10 shillings a quarter and could use as much electricity as they liked. The first houses to have electricity had sun rays painted on the front, and these can still be seen along the highest row of terraced housing in the village.

==Norwegian connection==
During the Second World War, King Haakon VII of Norway visited a house in Wormit used as a base by officers of the Norwegian Army. The soldiers painted a sea motif for the king on the walls of a bedroom, and it is still present in the house. Norwegian Catalina flying boats of No. 333 Squadron RNoAF were stationed at Woodhaven, Fife, and a Norwegian flag is still flown in the harbour, which has since been changed back into Wormit Boating Club, from where occasional pleasure sailings operate for much of the year upon the River Tay, mainly between the Tay Rail Bridge and Tay Road Bridge.

==Reservoir==
Wormit water reservoir was built in 1923 in anticipation of the population of the town growing, but war intervened and the reservoir was eventually decommissioned due to costs. Trevor Cox, a professor of acoustic engineering at the University of Salford, identified the reservoir as one of the &quot;strangest sounding places in the UK&quot;. It is a large concrete box long, wide and high. In a normal room, sounds die away quickly due to sound waves reflecting in to the walls, losing energy. In Wormit water reservoir, the size of the room means the time between reflections is much greater, coupled with sound waves losing less energy when reflecting off concrete, meaning sounds last for much longer. This was demonstrated by an experiment in which a balloon was popped inside the reservoir.

==Amenities and services==
Wormit has its own primary school (established in 1896), church, blacksmith, garage, hair dresser, restaurant and local shop. The local secondary school is Madras College, St Andrews.

There are several sports clubs within Wormit, including tennis, bowling and boating clubs. 
Wormit Bowling Club was established in 1901; its clubhouse was built in 1955.

<doc id="630540" wikidata="Q4037739" url="?curid=630540" title="Dübs and Company">
<text>Dübs &amp; Co. was a locomotive manufacturer in Glasgow, Scotland, founded by Henry Dübs in 1863 and based at the Queens Park Works in Polmadie. In 1903 it amalgamated with two other Glasgow locomotive manufacturers to create the North British Locomotive Company.

==Preserved locomotives==

Eleven locomotives built for the New Zealand Railways Department, numerous others in South Africa and the Isle of Man.

===Preserved locomotives in New Zealand===
Four members of the 0-4-0 A class built in 1873 have been preserved. A 64 and A 67 are in full operational condition on vintage railways; A 64 resides at The Plains Vintage Railway &amp; Historical Museum in Ashburton. A 67 is owned and operated by the Ocean Beach Railway / Otago Railway &amp; Locomotive Society Inc, while A 62 is in private ownership and it is understood that the smokebox has been snapped from the boiler. A 66 (also owned by the Ocean Beach Railway) was damaged by fire when the building in which it was kept on static display was burnt down, it is now on long term lease to a Southland preservation railway. 

Two members of the C class have survived (only five of the 16 locomotives were built by Dübs). Currently in operation at the Silver Stream Railway is an example from 1875 that originally had the wheel arrangement of 0-4-0 but was converted soon after purchase to 0-4-2 and is preserved with that wheel arrangement. Another member of the C class, 803, was recovered by the Westport Railway Preservation Society in 1993 from where it had been dumped in the Buller Gorge, West Coast, and was under restoration with the goal of returning it to a fully operational state. It was moved from Westport to the National Railway Museum of New Zealand in 2024.

Five members of the 0-6-0 F class built between 1878 and 1880 have been preserved. Currently in operational condition are F 163 and F 185. F 111 had its boiler condemned in 1980 and its owners, the Ocean Beach Railway, have yet to replace it; the Ocean Beach Railway also owns F 150 but it was leased to the Plains Vintage Railway of Ashburton in 1986 where it was unrestored and partially dismantled. In July 2019 it was transported to Invercargill where the Southern Steam Train Charitable Trust is having it restored for occasional use. This is expected to be completed by 2026. F 230 was converted to a wheel arrangement of 0-4-2 on a private industrial line and is on static display at Hamilton Lake Park in a somewhat rundown condition. Other members of the 88-total F class that still exist were built by other manufacturers.

===Preserved locomotives in Australia===
The oldest steam locomotive in Tasmania is Dübs No.1415 of 1880. It is a Queensland 4D9 class locomotive and was built to run on Queensland Railways&#x27; gauge. In 1917 the locomotive was sold to the Strahan Marine Board on Tasmania&#x27;s West Coast, where it was employed in the construction of the breakwater at Hells Gates at the entrance to Macquarie Harbour. The locomotive is now on display (minus cab) at the Don River Railway.

On Sunday, 30 December 1900, the Emu Bay Railway (EBR) took delivery of three Dübs 4-8-0 locomotives to run on the Melba line from Burnie to Zeehan. The locomotives were EBR Nos. 6 (3854/1900), 7 (3856/1900) and 8 (3855/1900). No.7 was taken out of service in 1959 and scrapped in 1963. In 1960 No.6 was named &quot;Murchsion&quot; and No.8 was named &quot;Heemskirk&quot; and both locomotives were repainted from drab black to a striking two tone blue livery to haul the new &quot;Westcoaster&quot; train, which transported buses and cars (and their occupants) from Burnie to Rosebery. No.6 is now on display at the West Coast Pioneers Museum at Zeehan, where its drab black (2006) has recently (2013) been replaced by the striking blue livery mentioned above. No.8 is preserved (in black) in running order at the Don River Railway preservation society at Devonport, Tasmania.

Mount Lyell Mining &amp; Railway Company purchased five 0-4-2RT (rack tank) locomotives to run on their gauge railway from Queenstown, Tasmania to Strahan, Tasmania, Australia, using the Abt Rack railway system. The first four of these were built by Dübs and the first three are still in existence. Mount Lyell No.1 (3369/1896) and Mount Lyell No.3 (3730/1898) operate on the West Coast Wilderness Railway. The third example, Mount Lyell No.2 (3594/1898) has now also been restored and operates on the West Coast Wilderness Railway.

No. 3730, built in 1898, is used by the West Coast Wilderness Railway between Strahan and Queenstown. It was locally fitted for the Abt Rack railway system.

Victorian Railways No. 2 steam crane, built 1890 by Dubs, works number 2711, is on display at the Newport Railway Museum, Melbourne.

===Preserved locomotives elsewhere===

In the United Kingdom, 1901-built Dübs crane tank No. 4101 is preserved at the Foxfield Light Railway, Stoke-on-Trent. It was operational and saw frequent use by late 2012.

In Ireland, 5 Slieve Callan is preserved at the West Clare Railway.

Natal Government Railways &#x27;A&#x27; Class 4-8-2 tank locomotive No. 196 (Works Number 3819 of 1899) returned to the UK for preservation by the NBL Preservation Group on 12 May 2011. It is on display at the Mizens Railway near Woking in Surrey. Full details can be found on www.nbloco.net

On the Isle of Man Railway, Manx Northern Railway 0-6-0 no. 4 &quot;Caledonia&quot; was built in 1885 (works no. 2178), renumbered 15 when brought into IoMR stock in 1904 (Boyd 1996; p. 188-192). Cale returned to service to commemorate its part in building the Snaefell Railway when a third rail to 3&#x27; gauge was laid to facilitate a return to Snaefell, and 15 has just undergone a major overhaul and returned to service after a brief absence.

Nos. 1 and 2 of NSB class XXI, built 1894, are preserved at the Setesdal Line museum railway, Norway. No. 1 has been out of service since the closure of ordinary activities at the Setesdal Line in 1962; no. 2 has been in regular use on the Setesdal Line since 1894 and until recently, both during ordinary activities and, since 1964, at the museum railway. It was undergoing a general service in August 2005.

Locomotive No.3 built for the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1882 is owned by the Prairie Dog Central enthusiast railway of Winnipeg, Manitoba. It underwent a thorough restoration, completed in early 2009.

Built in 1882 for Natal Government Railways (NGR), a predecessor to South African Railways, is Class-A No.88, restored and preserved by Umgeni Steam Railway (Durban, South Africa). It is used on the 3.2 km (2 mile) route from Durban to Point Road and later on the 23-hour trip from Durban to Johannesburg.

Built in 1888 for former Brazilian CP (unknown numbering) and later having been an industrial locomotive at Frigorífico Bordon is Dubs #2351, a 2-6-4T of gauge, completely restored for static exhibition at Museu de Tecnologia de São Paulo (São Paulo Technology Museum in São Paulo, SP.

A JGR Class 2100 0-6-2 locomotive, built in 1891 and numbered 2109, is preserved in working order at the Nippon Institute of Technology in Saitama, Japan. Its production number, 2774, is on the maker&#x27;s plate attached to the locomotive. It was used on the three-kilometre Seino Railway in Gifu to transport limestone until 1966. After being preserved on the Oigawa Railway, the Institute received the locomotive in September 1993.

The 0-6-2T locomotive No. 17 &quot;Urdaneta&quot;, part of the Manila Railway Dagupan class was built in 1888 was built for the Manila Railway Company. It entered service in 1890 and was retired in 1927. &quot;Urdaneta&quot; was one of the only four steam locomotives to be preserved by the Philippine National Railways, its modern-day successor. This locomotive is now on display in Dagupan.

<doc id="630544" wikidata="Q8036873" url="?curid=630544" title="Wormleighton">
<text>Wormleighton is a village in Warwickshire, England. It sits on Wormleighton Hill overlooking the River Cherwell. The population taken at the 2011 census was 183. 

The original village was on the banks of the Cherwell and can still be seen as a series of humps and hollows on the east bank of the Oxford Canal.
 The present village sits on the crest of the hill. At one end is St Peter&#x27;s Church, which has a Norman tower and nave, with small added Gothic aisles, made of local ironstone. The Church has remaining box pews, a Norman font, and an interesting tomb to Robert Spencer which gives his death date in 1610 (he died in France) both in the new Gregorian calendar (used in France from 1582) and in the old Julian calendar which was still used in Britain until 1752. The church is surrounded by its graveyard, which is accessible to local sheep. A path from the church leads to the remains of the old 16th-century manor house, Wormleighton Manor, of which the first view is a fine old chimney, then the great hall can be seen, part made of stone, part of brick. The gatehouse is Jacobean, and has a date of 1613 upon it. 

The manor house was slighted by the Parliamentarians as it was a Royalist stronghold. The village was abandoned after the English Civil War when the Spencer family home, Wormleighton Manor, was burned down in 1645. The village, however, was refounded in the 19th century, and there is a group of buildings in the Arts and Crafts style, as well as a number of thatched cottages.

The first mention of a post office in the village is in September 1853, when a type of postmark known as an undated circle was issued. The post office closed in 1971.

The historic family of Wormleighton is based in the north-west of England. During the Second World War, Captain Ronald fought with distinction and was awarded the Victoria Cross in 1944. The Spencer family fortune derived from Sir John Spencer of Wormleighton, Warwickshire, who bought Althorp in 1508 with the profits from his sheep-rearing business. In 1498 an inquest jury recorded that 60 villagers had been evicted from the Wormleighton Estate &quot;weeping, to wander in idleness ... perished of hunger&quot;.

<text>(Norwegian, ; , ), , or is an archipelago and a traditional district in the county of Nordland, Norway. Lofoten has distinctive scenery with dramatic mountains and peaks, open sea and sheltered bays, beaches, and untouched lands. There are two towns, Svolvær and Leknes – the latter is approximately north of the Arctic Circle and approximately away from the North Pole. The archipelago experiences one of the world&#x27;s largest elevated temperature anomalies relative to its high latitude.

== Etymology ==
In Norway, the archipelago and the area are called Lofoten. There have been many attempts to research the backgrounds and meanings of both the names Lofoten and Ofoten, which has led to many theories, but no definite information. Critical examination has not reached any generally accepted and justified interpretation of the name. 

According to one explanation &quot;Lofoten&quot; () was the original name of the island Vestvågøya. The first element is (i.e., &quot;lynx&quot;) and the last element is derived from Norse (i.e., &quot;foot&quot;), as the shape of the island must have been compared with that of a lynx&#x27;s foot. (The old name of the neighbouring island Flakstadøya was , &quot;wolf&#x27;s foot&quot;, from &quot;wolf&quot;.) The explanation has at least been seen in an article about Lofoten published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; newspaper, for which the reporter had claimed to have heard the explanation from the locals. However, this interpretation of the name has also received criticism. It is considered doubtful that the name Lófót itself meant the island of Vestvågøya from the beginning. Unlike, for example, the local names &quot;Værøya&quot; and &quot;Gimsøya&quot;, where the names clearly contain the endings meaning the island, the &quot;i Lofot&quot; appearing in the texts rather refers to the district, which nevertheless also included Vestvågøya.

Alternatively, the name could derive from the word for light in reference to the presence of Aurora Borealis as the word for light itself is the root of the Old Norse word for lynx , although the earliest evidence suggests was first the name of the island of Vestvågøy and only later becoming the name of the chain of islands. Most parsimonious is the analogy with Aurora Borealis, as the word is typically not used to describe the feet of beasts of prey, instead using the word (paw) or (also paw) for animals such as cats or dogs. can be used to describe legs, and as such, &#x27;light leg&#x27; represents the most plausible etymology taking into account the geography of the archipelago, eventually morphing to describe only the island of Vestvågøy before once again describing the island chain from its main island.

Another name one might come across is &quot;Lofotveggen&quot; or the Lofoten wall. The archipelago looks like a closed wall when seen from elevated points around Bodø Municipality or when arriving from the sea, some long, and high.

== History ==

According to Robert M. D&#x27;Anjou and others: &quot;There is evidence of human settlement extending back at least 11,000 years in Lofoten, and the earliest archaeological sites ... are only about 5,500 years old, at the transition from the early to late Stone Age&quot;. Iron Age agriculture, livestock, and significant human habitation can be traced back to 
The town of Vågan () is the first known town formation in northern Norway. It existed in the early Viking Age, maybe earlier, and was located on the southern coast on eastern Lofoten, near today&#x27;s village Kabelvåg in Vågan Municipality. The Lofotr Viking Museum with the reconstructed longhouse (the largest known) is located near Borg on Vestvågøya, which has many archeological finds from the Iron Age and Viking Age.

The islands have for more than 1,000 years been the centre of great cod fisheries, especially in winter, when the cod migrate south from the Barents Sea and gather in Lofoten to spawn. Bergen in southwestern Norway was for a long time the hub for further export of cod south to different parts of Europe, particularly so when trade was controlled by the Hanseatic League. In the lowland areas, particularly Vestvågøy, agriculture plays a significant role, as it has done since the Bronze Age.

In March 1941 the islands were raided by British Commandos during Operation Claymore, and in a subsequent diversionary attack to support the Vaagso raid in December.

As of 2017, the islands attract one million tourists a year.

== Geography ==

Lofoten is located at the 68th and 69th parallels north of the Arctic Circle in North Norway. Lofoten encompasses the municipalities of Vågan, Vestvågøy, Flakstad, Moskenes, Værøy, and Røst. The principal islands, running from north to south are:

*Southern tip of Hinnøya.
*Southern 60% (approx.) of Austvågøya ( in total )
*Gimsøya ( )
*Vestvågøya ( )
*Flakstadøya ( )
*Moskenesøya ( )
Further to the south are the small and isolated islands of Værøy Municipality () and Røst Municipality (). The total land area amounts to , and the population totals 24,500. Many will argue that Hinnøya, the northern part of Austvågøya and several hundred smaller islands, skerries, and rocks to the east of Austvågøya are also part of the Lofoten district. Historically, the territorial definition of Lofoten has changed significantly. Between the mainland and the Lofoten archipelago lies the vast, open Vestfjorden, and to the north is the Vesterålen district. The principal towns in Lofoten are Leknes in Vestvågøy Municipality and Svolvær in Vågan Municipality. The main islands are joined to each other and the mainland by road bridges.

The Lofoten Islands are characterised by their mountains and peaks, sheltered inlets, stretches of seashore and large virgin areas. The highest mountain in Lofoten is Higravstinden () in Austvågøy; the Møysalen National Park just northeast of Lofoten has mountains reaching . The famous Moskstraumen (Malstrøm) system of tidal eddies is located in western Lofoten, and is indeed the root of the term maelstrom.

=== Geology ===
Lofoten is a horst ridge of bedrock. The rocks of Lofoten belong to the wider Western Gneiss Region of Norway. Some of the high relief and irregular surfaces of Lofoten has been attributed to etching that took place during the Mesozoic Era. Evidence of this would be the kaolinite found at some locations. To the northwest the Lofoten archipelago is bounded by the NE–SW-trending West Lofoten Border Fault. This is a normal fault whose fault scarp has been eroded forming a strandflat.

In Vestvågøya mountains have steep slopes towards the open sea in the northwest and southeast while slopes pointing towards the interior of the island are more gentle. This is the result of erosion acting on a landscape that has been uplifted along NE–SW-trending faults in the margins of Lofoten while the interior axis has remained more stable. In tectonic terms mountains are half-grabens and faults are of the dip-slip type.

The sea around Lofoten is known to host significant oil reserves: 1.3 bn barrels. Oil extraction in the Lofoten area is prohibited.

=== Wildlife ===
The sea is rich with life, and the world&#x27;s largest deep water coral reef, called the Røst Reef, is located west of Røst. Approximately 70% of all fish caught in the Norwegian and Barents seas use its islands&#x27; waters as a breeding ground. Otters are common, and there are elk on the largest islands. There are some woodlands with downy birch and rowan. There are no native conifer forests in Lofoten, but some small areas with private spruce plantations. &quot;Hedlundia hybrida&quot; and &quot;Malus sylvestris&quot; occur in Lofoten, but not further north.

====Birds====
Some of marine waters along the north-western coasts and fjords of the Lofoten Islands have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International (BLI) because it supports overwintering populations of common eiders and yellow-billed loons. The IBA contains or overlaps with the Seløya, Morfjorden, Laukvikøyene, Eggum and Borgværet nature reserves, as well as the Laukvikøyene Ramsar site. Lofoten has a high density of sea eagles and cormorants, and millions of other sea birds, among them the colourful puffin. It has mainland Europe&#x27;s largest seabird colony. The birds once mistaken for the extinct great auk turned out to be some of the nine king penguins released around Norway&#x27;s Lofoten Islands in August 1936, there until at least 1944.

=== Climate ===
Lofoten features a mostly subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) under the Köppen climate classification, although some parts like Skrova feature a temperate oceanic climate (Cfb). Winter temperatures in Lofoten are extremely mild considering its location north of the Arctic Circle – possibly the largest positive temperature anomaly in the world relative to latitude. The mild winters are a result of the temperate waters of the Norwegian Sea, which is warmed by the North Atlantic Current and the Norwegian Current. The mild air (Lows) from the Atlantic having a free path northwards even in winter is also very significant. 

Strong winds can occur in late autumn and winter. Snow and sleet are not uncommon in winter. The mountains can have substantial amounts of snow, and avalanches may come down from the steep slopes.

In Svolvær, the sun is above the horizon continuously (&quot;midnight sun&quot;) from 25 May to 17 July, and in winter the sun does not rise from 4 December to 7 January. In Leknes, the sun is above the horizon from 26 May to 17 July, and in winter the sun does not rise from 9 December to 4 January.

The temperature in the sea has been recorded since 1935. At depth in the sea near Skrova, water temperatures vary from a low of in March to in August, some years peaking above . November is around . At a depth of , the temperature is near all year.
Skrova lighthouse on an island near Svolvær has the longest recording of air temperature in Lofoten. The warmest temperature recorded is in June 1972. The coldest temperature recorded is in February 1966. The last overnight freeze in June was in 1962, and the last freeze in September was in 1986. Skrova and nearby Svolvær are among those places in North Norway that can record what Norwegians know as &quot;tropical nights&quot; when the overnight low does not go below . The warmest night recorded in Lofoten was July 1 1972 at Skrova with low , and the earliest in summer was June 10th 2011 with low . The wettest month recorded is December 1936 with 227 mm, and the driest is January 2014 with 0.9 mm. 


Even if the islands are not that large, there are climatic differences. Værøy and Røst furthest west have the warmest winters, but summer highs are cooler. Vestvågøy with the town Leknes has lowland in the interior of the island with mountains nearby; winters here are slightly colder and much wetter than at Skrova, while summers are drier and comparable.

== Sport ==
=== Mountaineering and rock climbing ===
Lofoten offers many rock climbing and mountaineering opportunities. It has 24  hours of daylight in the summer and has Alpine-style ridges, summits, and glaciers, but at a height of less than . The main centre for rock climbing is Henningsvær on Austvågøya.

The main areas for mountaineering and climbing are on Austvågøya and Moskenesøya. Moskenesøya features remote and serious mountaineering whereas Austvågøya is a very popular area for rock climbing.

=== Football ===
Lofoten has one of the world&#x27;s most noteworthy football pitches. Located in the village of Henningsvaer, the pitch at Henningsvaer Stadium rests on a rocky islet and has no actual seats.

=== Surfing ===
Unstad is one of its better-known locations for surfing. Every September surfers from around the world visit to compete in the Lofoten Masters.

=== Cycling ===
There is a well-marked cycling route that goes from Å in the south and continues past Fiskebøl in the north. The route is part public road, part cycle path with the option to bypass all of the tunnels by either cycle path (tunnels through mountains) or boat. Traffic is generally light, although in July there may be a lot of campervans. Some of the more remote sections are on gravel roads. There is a dedicated cycling ferry that sails between Ballstad and Nusfjord, allowing cyclists to avoid the long, steep Nappstraum tunnel. The route hugs the coastline for most of its length where it is generally flat. As it turns inland through the mountain passes there are a couple of climbs.

The Lofoten Insomnia Cycling Race takes place every year around midsummer, possible in the midnight sun, but certainly in 24-hour daylight, along the whole Lofoten archipelago.

The Arctic Race of Norway, the world&#x27;s northernmost professional stage race on road bike which takes place every year in Northern Norway, crossed the Lofoten islands during its first edition in August 2013. , the race was planned to be back in 2019 from Thursday 15 August to Sunday 18 August. The first two stages will cross the Lofoten archipelago from west to east.

== Transportation ==
The European road E10 connects the larger islands of Lofoten with bridges and undersea tunnels. The E10 road also connects Lofoten to the mainland of Norway through the Lofast road connection, which was officially opened on 1 December 2007. There are several daily bus services between the islands of Lofoten and between Lofoten and the mainland along E10. The Lofoten Islands are not serviced by any trains. However, the city of Narvik is connected to Stockholm and Oslo by train and connects directly to the Lofoten bus line. 

Bodø is often used as a hub for travel to Lofoten. In addition to air travel there is a ferry connecting Bodø to Moskenes, Værøy and Røst, and a speedboat connection to Svolvær. Bodø is connected by train to Trondheim and Oslo. There is also a ferry connecting Svolvær to Skutvik in Hamarøy Municipality, with a road connection east to E6. Hurtigruten calls at Stamsund and Svolvær. 

Lofoten is also served by a number of small airports:
*Leknes Airport (101,757 passengers in 2014)
*Svolvær Airport, Helle (74,496 passengers in 2014)
*Røst Airport (9,889 passengers in 2014), which mainly offers flights to Bodø.
*Værøy Heliport (9,420 passengers in 2014)
*Stokmarknes Airport, Skagen (93,782 passengers in 2016) is located in Vesterålen.
*Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes has direct flights to Oslo and Trondheim.

<text> () is an Arabic Islamic term referring to the custom, or &#x27;knowledge&#x27;, of a given society. To be recognized in an Islamic society, must be compatible with Sharia. When applied, it can lead to the deprecation or inoperability of a certain aspect of fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence).

 is a source of Islamic legal rulings where there are not explicit primary texts of the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah specifying the ruling. can also specify something generally established in the primary texts.

==Overview==
;Terminology
The term , meaning &quot;to know&quot;, refers to the customs and practices of a given society.

;History
 was first recognized by Abū Yūsuf (d. 182/798), an early leader of the Ḥanafī school, though it was considered part of the , and not as formal source. Later al-Sarak̲h̲sī (d. 483/1090) opposed it, holding that custom cannot prevail over a written text.

;Scriptural basis
The &quot;maxim&quot; that custom is an authoritative source for Islamic law &quot;appears in the Quran and Hadith&quot;. One hadith narrated by Ibn Mas&#x27;ud stated &#x27;Whatever the Muslim saw as good is [considered] good by God, and whatever the Muslim saw as evil is evil according to God.&#x27;&quot; 

==Sharia==
Although this was not formally included in Islamic law, the Sharia recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur&#x27;an or the Sunnah (called &quot;Divine silence&quot; ***sunnah is not &quot;divine silence&quot;). Practices later innovated are also justified, since Islamic tradition says what the people, in general, consider good is also considered as such by Allah (see God in Islam). According to some sources, holds as much authority as (consensus), and more than (legal reasoning by analogy). is the Islamic equivalent of &quot;common law&quot;.

In the application of , custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region, not merely in an isolated locality. If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts, custom is disregarded. However, if it is in opposition to , custom is given preference. Jurists also tend to, with caution, give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars.

In some countries such as Egypt, marriage, the way, refers to a form of common law marriage that does not involve obtaining official papers issued by the state ( ). The validity of that type of marriage is still under debate, and women may have fewer rights than under an officially-registered marriage.

<text>Sasser is a computer worm that affects computers running vulnerable versions of the Microsoft operating systems Windows XP and Windows 2000. Sasser spreads by exploiting the system through a vulnerable port. Thus it is particularly virulent in that it can spread without user intervention, but it is also easily stopped by a properly configured firewall or by downloading system updates from Windows Update. The specific hole Sasser exploits is documented by Microsoft in its MS04-011 bulletin (CVE-2003-0533), for which a patch had been released seventeen days earlier. The most characteristic experience of the worm is the shutdown timer that appears due to the worm crashing LSASS.

==History and effects==
Sasser was created on April 30, 2005. This worm was named Sasser because it spreads by exploiting a buffer overflow in the component known as LSASS (Local Security Authority Subsystem Service) on the affected operating systems. According to a report by eEye Digital Security published on April 13, 2004, this buffer overflow relies on an apparently deprecated API call to Microsoft Active Directory, which both allows for unchecked remote queries and crashes LSASS.exe if given a long string. Once on a machine, the worm scans different ranges of IP addresses and connects to victims&#x27; computers primarily through TCP port 445. If a vulnerable installation of XP or 2000 is found, the worm utilizes its own FTP server hosted on previously infected machines to download itself onto the newly compromised host. Microsoft&#x27;s analysis of the worm indicates that it may also spread through port 139. Several variants called &quot;Sasser.B&quot;, &quot;Sasser.C&quot;, and &quot;Sasser.D&quot; appeared within days (with the original named Sasser.A). The LSASS vulnerability was patched by Microsoft in the April 2004 installment of its monthly security packages, prior to the release of the worm. Some technology specialists have speculated that the worm writer reverse-engineered the patch to discover the vulnerability, which would open millions of computers whose operating system had not been upgraded with the security update.

The effects of Sasser included the news agency Agence France-Presse (AFP) having all its satellite communications blocked for hours and the U.S. flight company Delta Air Lines having to cancel several trans-atlantic flights because its computer systems had been swamped by the worm. The Nordic insurance company &quot;If&quot; and their Finnish owners &quot;Sampo Bank&quot; came to a complete halt and had to close their 130 offices in Finland. The British Coastguard had its electronic mapping service disabled for a few hours, and Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Post, and the European Commission also had issues with the worm. The X-ray department at Lund University Hospital had all their four layer X-ray machines disabled for several hours and had to redirect emergency X-ray patients to a nearby hospital.

On 8 May 2005, an 19-year-old German named Sven Jaschan from Rotenburg, Lower Saxony, then student at a technical college, was arrested for writing the worm. German authorities were led to Jaschan partly because of information obtained in response to a bounty offer by Microsoft of US$250,000.

One of Jaschan&#x27;s friends had informed Microsoft that his friend had created the worm. He further revealed that not only Sasser, but also Netsky.AC, a variant of the Netsky worm, was his creation. Another variation of Sasser, Sasser.E, was found to be circulating shortly after the arrest. It was the only variation that attempted to remove other worms from the infected computer, much in the way Netsky does.

Jaschan was tried as a minor because the German courts determined that he created the worm before he was 18. The worm itself had been released on his 18th birthday (29 April 2004). Sven Jaschan was found guilty of computer sabotage and illegally altering data. On Friday, 8 July 2005, he received a 21-month suspended sentence.

==Side effects==
An indication of the worm&#x27;s infection of a given PC is the existence of the files codice_1, codice_2 or codice_3 on the PC&#x27;s hard disk, the codice_4 running randomly and 100% CPU usage, as well as seemingly random crashes with LSA Shell (Export Version) caused by faulty code used in the worm. The most characteristic symptom of the worm is the shutdown timer that appears due to the worm crashing LSASS.exe.

==Workarounds==
The shutdown sequence can be aborted by pressing start and using the Run command to enter codice_5. This aborts the system shutdown so the user may continue what they were doing. The shutdown.exe file is not available by default within Windows 2000, but can be installed from the Windows 2000 resource kit. It is available in Windows XP.
A second option to stop the worm from shutting down a computer is to change the time and/or date on its clock to earlier; the shutdown time will move as far into the future as the clock was set back.

== Removal ==
The Sasser worm can be removed by pressing start and using the Run command to enter codice_5. This will abort the shutdown caused by the termination of lsass.exe, allowing the user more time to remove the worm. The worm may be removed by running codice_7 and navigating to codice_8. There, the user must remove the codice_9 string. Next, the user must terminate codice_9 in task manager. Next, the user must navigate to codice_11 and delete codice_12. Finally, the user must navigate to codice_13 and delete codice_9 and reboot. After a reboot, the user&#x27;s PC will no longer be infected with Sasser.

<doc id="630554" wikidata="Q1196022" url="?curid=630554" title="Wu Daozi">
<text>Wu Daozi ( or ), also known as Daoxuan and Wu Tao Tzu, was a Chinese painter of the Tang dynasty. The British art historian Michael Sullivan considers him one of &quot;the masters of the seventh century,&quot; Some of his works survive; many, mostly murals, have been lost.

Wu&#x27;s father died when he was at an early age, and he subsequently lived in poverty. He learned calligraphy from Zhang Xu and He Zhizhang, before specialising in painting. He pioneered realistic techniques, the formal establishment of brushwork, and landscape painting. He painted figures with round strokes so as to show their flowing clothes.

== Works ==
He traveled widely and created murals in Buddhist and Daoist temples. Wu also drew mountains, rivers, flowers, birds. No authentic originals are extant, though some exist in later copies or stone carvings. Wu&#x27;s famous painting of Confucius was preserved through being copied in a stone engraving.

== Legends==
Numerous legends gathered around Wu Daozi, often concerning commissions by Emperor Xuanzong.

In one, Emperor Xuanzong called him to paint a wall of his palace. He painted a wall mural displaying a rich nature-scene set in a valley, containing a stunning array of flora and fauna and including a cave at the foot of a mountain. The story goes that he informed the emperor that it&#x27;s not just what the emperor is able to see, Wu Daozi has made this painting in such a way, that a spirit dwells in the cave. Next, he clapped his hands and entered the cave, inviting the emperor to follow. The painter entered the cave but the entrance closed behind him and, before the astonished emperor could move or utter a word, the painting vanished from the wall. This story depicts the spirituality of art. The contemporary Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist meditates on this legend and the challenge that it poses to modern aesthetics in his book, &quot;The Myth of Wu Tao-Tzu.&quot;

Another legend states that Emperor Xuanzong sent Wu Daozi to Sichuan to study the green waters of the Jialing River in order to complete a mural of its entire course. Supposedly, Wu returned without sketches and rapidly painted the entire river from memory, completing the 300-li account within a single day. It is sometimes added that his technique was foiled by Li Sixun, who accompanied him and followed the traditional practice of working slowly from numerous prepared sketches. To the extent that it is grounded in a real event, however, it probably only reflects Wu&#x27;s speed of execution and not a lack of reliance on sketches.

Another has it that a painter found one of the last surviving murals of Wu Daozi and learned to imitate the style. He then destroyed the wall, possibly by pushing it into a river, to ensure that no one else could learn the same secrets.

<text>Glenrothes (; , ; ; , pronounced [kʲlən̪ˠˈrˠahɪʃ]) is a town situated in the heart of Fife, in east-central Scotland. It had a population of 39,277 in the 2011 census, making it the third largest settlement in Fife and the 18th most populous locality in Scotland. Glenrothes is the administrative capital of Fife, containing the headquarters of both Fife Council and Police Scotland Fife Division and is a major service and employment centre within the area.

Planned in the 1940s, following World War II, as Scotland&#x27;s second new town its purpose was to generate economic growth and renewal in central Fife. Initially this was to be done by providing new homes, industries, infrastructure and services needed to support the development of a newly established National Coal Board &#x27;super pit&#x27;, the Rothes Colliery. The mine closed early in its life and the town&#x27;s economy thereafter transitioned and diversified, establishing it as an important centre for industry and playing a significant role in establishing Scotland&#x27;s Silicon Glen between 1961 and 2000. The name Glenrothes comes from its historical link with the Earl of Rothes, who owned much of the land on which the new town has been built; &quot;Glen&quot; (Scottish for valley) was added to the name to avoid confusion with Rothes in Moray and in recognition that the town lies in a river valley. The motto of Glenrothes is , meaning &quot;From the Earth Comes Life&quot;, which dates back to the founding of the town.

The town has won multiple horticultural awards in the Beautiful Scotland and Britain in Bloom contests for the quality of its parks and landscaping. It has numerous outdoor sculptures and artworks, a result of the appointment of town artists in the early development of the town. It is also a centre for excellence within the high-tech electronics and manufacturing industry sectors; several organisations have their global headquarters in Glenrothes. Major employers include Bosch Rexroth (hydraulics manufacturing), Fife College (education), Leviton (fibre optics manufacturing) and Raytheon (defence and electronics). Glenrothes is unique in Fife as much of the town centre floorspace is internalised within Fife&#x27;s largest shopping centre, the Kingdom Shopping Centre. Public facilities include a regional sports and leisure centre, two golf courses, major parks, a civic centre and theatre and a college campus.

The A92 trunk road provides the principal road access, passing through Glenrothes and connecting it to the wider Scottish motorway and trunk road network. A major bus station is located in the town centre, providing regional and local bus services to surrounding settlements. Glenrothes lies on the edge of the Edinburgh–Dundee line and Fife Circle rail line with railway stations serving the town located at Markinch and Thornton.

==History==
===Toponymy===

The decision on the town&#x27;s name was taken by the Fife Planning Committee which met in Cupar on 4 July 1947. Twelve names were considered for the new town prior to its formal designation. From the list of names Glenrothes and Westwood tied with five ballot votes each. Cadham, Drostain, Thaines and Woodside each received a single vote. The name Westwood was proposed by Provost Drummond, after Joseph Westwood, who was a strong advocate for the delivery of the new town, cut his political teeth in Fife and was Secretary of State for Scotland at the time. Glenrothes carried the day by eight votes to six on a second ballot despite the plea to recognise Westwood’s “services to the country”. In a tragic twist of fate Joseph Westwood died 18 days later in a car accident.

The name Rothes comes from the association with the Earl of Rothes, of the Leslie family. This family historically owned much of the land on which Glenrothes has been built, and gave its name to the adjacent village of Leslie. &quot;Glen&quot; (from the Scottish Gaelic word &quot;gleann&quot; meaning valley) was added to prevent confusion with Rothes in Moray, and to reflect the location of the town within the River Leven valley.

The different areas (&quot;precincts&quot;) of Glenrothes have been named after the hamlets that were already established in the area (e.g. Cadham, Woodside), the farms which formally occupied the land (e.g. Caskieberran, Collydean, Rimbleton) or the historical estate homes in the area (e.g. Balbirnie, Balgeddie, Leslie Parks).

===Early known settlement===

Glenrothes is home to the remains of ancient stone circles which can be seen at Balbirnie and Balfarg in the northeast of the town. The Balfarg henge was constructed around 3000 BC and contains the remnants of a stone circle which has been partly reconstructed. The henge was excavated between 1977 and 1978 prior to the development of a new housing estate. The Balbirnie stone circle and cairn, only about 500 m away from Balfarg, was excavated between 1970 and 1971. To allow widening of the A92, the stones were moved a short distance to a new location at North Lodge and reconstructed as nearly as possible in the original way. The stone circle has been carbon dated as being from the Bronze Age. It is thought that the Balbirnie stone circle and the Balfarg circle once formed part of a larger ceremonial complex.

There are a number of former country houses in Glenrothes. Balbirnie House, a category-A listed Georgian period building, was bought along with its grounds in 1969 by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) from the Balfour family to be developed as Balbirnie Country Park and Golf Course. The house was later occupied and restored by the GDC in 1981, to stop the property falling into disrepair. This led to interest, and the house was converted into a four-star hotel in 1989. The B-listed former stable block of the house was converted into a craft centre. Balgeddie House, a C-Listed former residence of Sir Robert Spencer Nairn located in the northwest of the town and built in the 1930s, has also been converted into a hotel. Leslie House, the category-A listed 17th century former home of the Earl of Rothes (Clan Leslie), became a care home for the elderly in 1945; owned by the Church of Scotland. The building was in the process of being renovated, when the interior and roof of the house were destroyed by a fire in February 2009. However, proposals to restore the mansion were approved in 2019. Much of the former grounds of Leslie House have been used to create Riverside Park. Collydean precinct hosts a ruin of a 17th-century house called Pitcairn House which was built for and first occupied by Archibald Pitcairne, a famous Scottish physician.

The land which Glenrothes now occupies was largely agricultural, and once contained a number of small rural communities and the hamlets of Cadham and Woodside, which were established to house workers at local paper mills.

===Glenrothes new town===

Glenrothes was designated in 1948 under the New Towns Act 1946 as Scotland&#x27;s second post-war new town. The planning, development, management and promotion of the new town were the responsibility of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC), a quango appointed by the Secretary of State for Scotland. The corporation board consisted of eight members including a chairman and deputy chairman. The first meeting of the GDC was in Auchmuty House, provided by Tullis Russell on 20 June 1949.

The original plan was to build a new settlement for a population of 32,000 to 35,000. The initial preferred option for the new town would have centred it on Markinch, building around the original settlement and utilising the existing services and infrastructure, including the rail station there. However the village&#x27;s infrastructure was deemed unable to withstand the substantial growth that would be needed for a new town of the scale proposed and there was considerable local opposition to the plans. Leslie and Thornton were also considered as possible locations, again meeting local opposition, and eventually the area between all of these villages, amounting to , was zoned for the new town&#x27;s development. Much of the historical Aytoun, Balfour, Balgonie and Rothes estates were included in Glenrothes&#x27; assigned area, along with the historical country houses Balbirnie House, Balgeddie House and Leslie House.

Unlike the other post-war Scottish new towns, Cumbernauld, East Kilbride, Irvine and Livingston, Glenrothes was not originally to be a Glasgow overspill new town, although it did later take this role. It was however populated in the early 1950s, in part by families moving from the declining coalfield areas of Scotland. It is also the only Scottish new town not to take its name from an existing settlement; in that respect it was a completely new settlement.

===Industrial history===
Before Glenrothes was developed, the main industries in the area were papermaking, coal mining and farming. Local paper manufacturers included the Auchmuty and Rothes Mills (latterly Tullis Russell) and Balbirnie Mills (later Sappi Graphics) near Markinch in the east and the Fettykil (now the Sapphire Paper Mill) and Prinlaws Mills to the west at Leslie. The paper mills were established along the banks of the River Leven, which provided energy to power their operations.
Scotland had emerged from the Second World War in a strong position both to contribute to the UK&#x27;s post-war reconstruction, and to help repay heavy overseas debt incurred in rearmament and six years of war. At the heart of government strategy was the need to produce energy, and the first focus of the resulting industrial renewal was massive investment by the state in the Scottish coal industry. The case for developing Glenrothes was partially driven by this strategy, and was further advanced in a report produced in 1946 by Sir Frank Mears to the Central and South-East Scotland Planning Committee. This specifically made the case for a new town in the Leslie-Markinch area to support growth in the coal mining industry in Fife.

The Rothes Colliery, the new coal mine associated with the town&#x27;s development, was built on land to the west of Thornton, an established village south of Glenrothes. The mine, which was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957, was promoted as a key driver in the economic regeneration of central Fife. However, unstemmable flooding and geological problems in the area, combined with a lessening demand for coal nationally, made the mine less viable, and it was closed in 1965. Ironically, miners who had worked in older deep pits in the area had warned against the development of the Rothes pit for this very reason.

On 28 May 1963 Cadco Development Ltd held a press conference in Edinburgh to announce that they were bringing 2,000 jobs to Glenrothes. They were going to take three factories on the Queensway Industrial Estate; open pig breeding units at Whitehill; and build a supermarket in the town centre. Cadco&#x27;s board of directors included the film star George Sanders and his wife Benita Hume alongside Denis Loraine and Tom Roe (Thomas Chambers Windsor Roe). Loraine soon persuaded the Glenrothes Development Corporation that the construction work should be carried out by Cadco&#x27;s own building company, which had opened a depot in nearby Kirkcaldy. By May 1964 Cadco were confident that their factories would soon start production, but by October all work had stopped because the Cadco Building Company had not paid its sub-contractors and suppliers. It transpired that Cadco did not have the money to back up its plans; and the banks and small companies who had respectively paid for and done the advance work found themselves out of pocket; and its employees lost their jobs. It turned out that the money the development corporation had paid to Cadco for building work had been used instead to help the failing Royal Victoria Sausages Company in Brighton. When the scam was exposed, the town&#x27;s MP Willie Hamilton posed questions in the House of Commons and a Board of Trade inquiry was set up. As the hoped-for jobs evaporated, the development corporation, the Royal Bank of Scotland and others involved had to explain to the Board of Trade inspectors how they been taken in by Denis Loraine and Cadco. However no-one was ever prosecuted for their part in the affair in the United Kingdom. Historians speculate that this was because of the involvement, direct and indirect, of people in high places, particularly future Prime Minister, Edward Heath and Hollywood actress Jayne Mansfield. Investors alleged to be compromised by the scandal ranged from novelist Graham Greene to Charlie Chaplin. After the scandal broke, Loraine fled to the United States, only avoiding a long prison sentence by working under cover to help bring to justice those behind the biggest counterfeiting operation in US history.

The closure of the Rothes Colliery almost halted the further development of Glenrothes. Soon afterwards however, central government modified the town&#x27;s role by appointing it as an economic focal point for economic growth and development, one of several across Central Scotland to be developed as part of a Regional Plan. The Glenrothes Development Corporation were able to use this status to attract a plethora of light industries and modern electronics factories to the town. The first big overseas electronic investor was Beckmans Instruments in 1959, followed by Hughes Industries in the early 1960s. A number of other important companies followed, establishing Glenrothes as a major industrial hub in Scotland&#x27;s Silicon Glen. In the mid-1970s, the town also replaced Cupar as the HQ of Fife Regional Council, making it the administrative centre of Fife.
Major industrial estates were developed to the south of Glenrothes, largely because it was near the proposed East Fife Regional Road (A92) which was developed in 1989, giving dual carriageway access to the main central Scotland road network. The rapid growth experienced in Silicon Glen peaked in the 1990s with Canon developing their first UK manufacturing plant at Westwood Park in Glenrothes in 1992. ADC Telecommunications, a major American electronics company, established a base at Bankhead in early 2000 with the promise of a substantial number of jobs. Around the start of the 21st century, a decline in major electronics manufacturing in Scotland affected the town&#x27;s economy, and thus the industrial base of the town was forced to diversify for the second time in its short history. By 2004 both ADC and Canon had closed their Glenrothes operations, with much of the promised jobs growth failing to materialise. This was largely due to the electronics industrial sector in Glenrothes and most of central Scotland being dependent upon an inward investment strategy that led to almost 43% of employment in foreign-owned plants which were susceptible to changes in global economic markets.

===Modern history===
The GDC was finally wound up in 1995 after which responsibility for Glenrothes was largely transferred to Fife Council with assets such as the Kingdom Shopping Centre, industrial and office units sold off to private sector companies. However, by 1995 the GDC had left a lasting legacy on the town by overseeing the development of over 15,000 houses, of industrial floorspace, of office floorspace and of shopping floorspace. Since the winding up of the GDC Glenrothes continues to serve as Fife&#x27;s principal administrative centre and serves a wider sub-regional area as a major centre for services and employment.

In 2008, coinciding with the town&#x27;s 60th anniversary, Canadian artist and researcher Sylvia Grace Borda chose to explore the town as if she were a late-1960s photographer of common places. The outcome was the production of a series of images which the artist believes contradict how some Scots would &#x27;see&#x27; Glenrothes.

Annual awards that were set up by Urban Realm and Carnyx Group in the mid-2000s to challenge the quality of built environments in Scotland saw Glenrothes awarded their Carbuncle Award in 2009. The judges awarded Glenrothes the category of the most dismal place in Scotland for its &quot;depressed and investment starved town centre&quot;. This generated mixed and polarized views from locals and built environment professionals alike. Paradoxically in 2010 the town won awards for being the &quot;Best Kept Large Town&quot; and the most &quot;Clean, sustainable and beautiful community&quot; in Scotland in the Beautiful Scotland competition and was the winner in the &quot;large town&quot; category in the 2011 Royal Horticultural Society Britain in Bloom competition. The town achieved further Gold awards in the 2013 and 2014 UK finals.

In 2011 then Historic Scotland completed an assessment of the town art in Glenrothes, ultimately awarding listed status to a number of artworks scattered throughout the town. The organisation also gave positive recognition to Glenrothes&#x27; significant role in helping to create the idea of art being a key factor in creating a sense of place.

Glenrothes&#x27; place and importance in the history and development of Scotland has been enshrined in the Great Tapestry of Scotland, which was unveiled in 2013 in the Scottish Parliament. The Glenrothes panel shows various pieces of the town&#x27;s public artworks, along with visual references to its important industrial heritage associated originally with coal mining and later as a major centre for &quot;Silicon Glen&quot; industries.

In mid-2015 Tullis Russell Papermakers, a stalwart to the local area economy for around 200 years, went into administration. The Scottish Government and Fife Council established a taskforce to help mitigate the effects of job losses and put in place appropriate support for a sustainable future for the area. Around £6 million was set aside to support the Fife Taskforce&#x27;s Action Plan which included projects such as the Queensway Technology Park; supporting the regeneration of Queensway Industrial Estate to develop a modern business and technology park which can utilise the proximity to RWE&#x27;s Biomass Power Generation facility and to a Green Data Centre. The Glenrothes Enterprise Hub was another project delivered as a result of the task force support. Redevelopment on the site of the former mills for mixed uses including around 800 new homes, retail, businesses and industry commenced in early 2022.

The Glenrothes Energy Network was progressed in 2017 to utilise the heat from the RWE Markinch Biomass CHP plant which opened in March 2015. The project was a collaboration between Fife Council, RWE and the Scottish Government. It was awarded Scottish Government funding in May 2017 as part of the Scottish Energy Strategy. Construction of the heat network commenced in June 2018 and the network became operational in April 2019 making it Scotland&#x27;s first 100% renewable biomass heat and power district network. The network was officially opened by the Scottish Minister for Energy, Connectivity and the Islands, Paul Wheelhouse. In 2019 the project won the Cities &amp; Communities award at the Decentralized Energy Awards organised by the Association for Decentralised Energy. It supplies low carbon heat to Council offices, local businesses and homes in Glenrothes.

==Governance==

In the early years of the creation of the new town the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) with input from the local authority, then Fife County Council, and later Kirkcaldy District Council and Fife Regional Council, oversaw the governance. There was some controversy in this arrangement in that Glenrothes was the only new town designated in the UK without the power to agree to any planning applications that fell within its boundary with such decisions taken by either Kirkcaldy District or Fife Regional Councils. There were proposals to formally establish a Glenrothes District Council but this was overtaken by proposals for broader local government reorganisation that took place in the 1990s. Also in the early 1990s the then Conservative UK Government established a wind-up order for all of the UK&#x27;s new town development corporations. Responsibilities for the assets, management and governance of all of the new towns were to be transferred to either private sector companies, or to the local authorities or other government organisations.

Glenrothes is represented by a number of tiers of elected government. North Glenrothes Community Council and Pitteuchar, Stenton and Finglassie Community Council form the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government.

Fife Council is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance in the region and has its main headquarters in Glenrothes. Council meetings take place in Fife House (formerly known as Glenrothes House) in the town centre. The west wing of the building was built by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) as their offices in 1969, which was later used as the headquarters of Fife Regional Council. Glenrothes is divided by 3 of the 22 Fife Council electoral wards, Glenrothes Central and Thornton (ward), Glenrothes North, Leslie and Markinch (ward) and Glenrothes West and Kinglassie (ward).

The town forms part of the county constituency of Glenrothes and Mid-Fife, electing one Member of Parliament (MP) to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom by the first past the post system. Richard Baker of the Labour Party is the MP for Glenrothes after being elected in the 2024 general election. He replaced Peter Grant of the Scottish National Party who was the MP for Glenrothes after being elected in the 2015 general election and the snap election in 2017.

For the purposes of the Scottish Parliament, Glenrothes forms part of the Mid Fife and Glenrothes constituency following the 2011 Scottish elections. This constituency replaced the former Central Fife constituency. Each constituency elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) by the first past the post system of election, and the region elects seven additional members to produce a form of proportional representation. Following the 2016 and 2021 Scottish Elections the constituency is represented by Jenny Gilruth MSP of the Scottish National Party.

==Geography==
Glenrothes lies inland and is located in mid-Fife between the agricultural Howe of Fife in the north and east and Fife&#x27;s industrial heartland in the south and west. Its immediate neighbouring settlements are Coaltown of Balgonie, Leslie, Markinch and Thornton, whose boundaries are virtually indistinguishable from Glenrothes&#x27; forming a contiguous urban area. The villages of Kinglassie, Milton of Balgonie and Star are located slightly further away and are physically separated from Glenrothes by farmland. Kirkcaldy, a former royal burgh, port and industrial town is the next nearest large settlement located approximately to the south on the coast of the Firth of Forth. Glenrothes is also located equidistant from two of Fife&#x27;s other historically important principal settlements, Dunfermline and St Andrews, at and away. Two of Scotland&#x27;s major cities, Edinburgh and Dundee, are located almost equidistantly from Glenrothes at and away, respectively. The smaller Scottish city of Perth is located to the northwest.

The northern parts of the settlement lie upland on the southern fringes of the Lomond Hills Regional Park. The central parts of the town extend between the Warout Ridge and the southern edge of the River Leven valley; a substantial green space which passes east west through the town. Southern parts of Glenrothes are largely industrial and are situated on land which gently slopes south towards the Lochty Burn and the village of Thornton. The height above mean sea level at the town centre is . Temperatures in Glenrothes, like the rest of Scotland, are relatively moderate given its northern latitude. Fife is a peninsula, located between the Firth of Tay in the north, the Firth of Forth in the south and the North Sea in the east. Summers are relatively cool and the warming of the water over the summer results in warm winters. Average annual temperatures in Glenrothes range from a maximum of to a minimum of .

A linked network of semi-natural landscape areas throughout the town allow for a mix of biodiversity with different flora and fauna and wildlife habitats. Areas of ancient woodland are found in Riverside Park and Balbirnie Park, both of which are also designated historic gardens and designed landscapes. Balbirnie Park is renowned for having a large collection of rhododendron species. Protected wildlife species found in the Glenrothes area include red squirrels, water voles and various types of bats. Landscape areas also act as natural drainage systems, reducing the likelihood of flooding in the built up areas of the town, with rainwater flows channelled to the River Leven, or to the Lochty Burn. Landscape planning has also ensured that Glenrothes&#x27; road network, with particular focuses on the town&#x27;s many roundabouts, provides green networks throughout the town.

===Built environment and urban form===

Careful consideration was given to the form and infrastructure of the town, focusing on the creation of individual suburban type neighbourhoods (precincts), each with their own architectural identity. Engineers, planners, builders and architects were tasked with creating not only good quality mass-produced housing but green spaces, tree planting, wildlife corridors and soft and hard landscaping. This was seen as an equally important part of the process, helping to provide a sense of place and connection to the land that a New Town was felt to need in order to become a successful place where people would want to live and raise children. Separating industry from housing areas in planned industrial estates was a key element of early plans. This was at the time seen as an important change from the &quot;chaotic&quot;, congested and polluted industrial towns and cities of the previous centuries where cramped unsanitary housing and dirty industries were built in close proximity to one another.

The vision for Glenrothes was to provide a clean, healthy and safe environment for the town&#x27;s residents and much of the housing, as in most other new towns (especially in Scotland) took the form of council housing built by the Glenrothes Development Corporation. The provision of council housing, part of a nation-wide trend towards this type of tenure, gave the local development corporation an even greater overall ability to implement its vision of a planned built environment while also fulfilling one of the primary aims of the new towns: to create affordable housing for workers in areas that were to be centres of new industry and economic growth. The new homes simultaneously provided affordable housing for people being relocated from crowded &quot;slum&quot; areas in the industrial Central Belt (and Glasgow in particular), though the latter was less of priority for Glenrothes initially compared to other Scottish new towns such as East Kilbride and Cumbernauld which were more specifically planned to fulfill a so-called &quot;overspill&quot; function.
The settlement has been purposely planned using a series of masterplans. Development of Glenrothes started in Woodside in the east and progressed westwards with the first town masterplan implemented as far as South Parks and Rimbleton housing precincts. Early neighbourhoods were based on Ebenezer Howard&#x27;s Garden City philosophy, using relatively tried and tested principles of town planning and architecture which is reflected in their housing styles and layouts. The first town masterplan sub-divided the town&#x27;s designated area into self-contained residential precincts with their own primary schools, local shops and community facilities, consistent with other new towns being built elsewhere in the UK in the same period.

A second town masterplan was then developed in the late 1960s following Glenrothes&#x27; change of role and was to accommodate an increased population of 50,000–70,000. New areas of land in the north and south of the designated area were identified for new development. The road network was redesigned and upgraded to deal with projected increases in car ownership and new housing estates were developed to the west, then to the south and finally to the north of the designated area.

The housing precincts of the 1960s and 1970s, developed under the second masterplan, departed slightly from the garden city ideals instead adopting Radburn principles; separating as far as practical footpaths from roads. The housing precincts were designed to better accommodate increases in car ownership which increased significantly from the 1960s onwards. The townscape changed in this period seeing more use of contemporary architectural styles of the time and newer forms of development layouts. Terraced housing and blocks of flats were predominantly developed and housing designs also used flat roofed and mono pitch roof styles to create variety. The fronts of houses were in many instances designed to face onto public footpaths and open spaces. Car parking was kept either to the rear of properties or in parking bays located nearby in efforts to minimise conflict with pedestrians.

Housing precincts from the 1980s onwards were largely developed by the private sector with the majority of this housing developed in low density suburban cul-de-sacs. Areas of structural planting, tree belts and open spaces were purposely designed to blend housing and factories into the hillsides and local landscape.

===Geology===
The Glenrothes area&#x27;s geology is predominantly made up of glacial deposits with the subsoil largely consisting of boulder clay with a band of sand and gravel in the area to the north of the River Leven. The river valley largely comprises alluvium deposits and there are also igneous intrusions of olivine dolerite throughout the area. Productive coal measures were largely recorded in the southern parts of Glenrothes, approximately south of the line of the B921 Kinglassie road. These coal measures form part of the East Fife coalfield and prior to 1962 the deposits there were to be worked by the Rothes Colliery, until it was found that there were severe issues with water penetration and subsequent flooding. Smaller limestone coal outcrops that had been historically worked were recorded around the Balbirnie and Cadham/Balfarg areas with the land that is now Gilvenbank Park found particularly to be heavily undermined.

===Climate===
Like most of central Scotland, Glenrothes has a maritime climate. Glenrothes has a much milder climate than other places at its latitude such as Moscow and Edmonton. Summer is often temperate with temperatures between 18 °C and 25 °C.
Winter is mild with temperatures between 0 °C and 10 °C; the temperature rarely falls below -5 °C due to its proximity to the ocean and the Gulf Stream.

==Demography==

In 1950 the population in the Glenrothes designated area was about 1,000 people, located in the hamlets of Woodside and Cadham and in the numerous farm steadings that were spread throughout the area. Population growth in the early phases of the town was described as slow due to the dependence on the growth of jobs at the Rothes Colliery. In 1960 the town population was shown to have increased to 12,499 people, and it had risen to 28,098 by 1969. The fastest growth was between 1964 and 1969, with average inward migration of 1,900 persons per year. In 1981 Glenrothes&#x27; population was estimated at 35,000 and at the time the GDC was disbanded in 1995 it was estimated to be just over 40,000.
The 2001 census recorded the population of Glenrothes at 38,679 representing 11% of Fife&#x27;s total population. The 2011 census recorded a 1.5% population rise to 39,277.

The total population in the wider Glenrothes area was estimated at 49,817 in 23,596 households in 2022. 61% of the population is of working age (16–64 years). Glenrothes is similar to Fife for the percentage of homes which are owner occupied (62%) social rented (25%) or private rented (11%). The Area has a higher employment rate (74.5%), and a lower rate of those who are classed
as economically inactive (21.8%) than Fife. Employment (10.9%) and income deprivation (13.8%) are just above the levels for Fife as a whole. 91.9% of 16-19 year olds are participating in education, employment or training, showing similar patterns to Fife across all categories. The Glenrothes (UK Parliament constituency) Area&#x27;s median weekly income was calculated at £559.10 (residents earnings) and £567.10 (workplace earnings) in 2022.

The working age population of the town in 2011 was 29,079 as recorded by the census. The percentage of population economically active in Glenrothes was recorded at 75.2% in 2021. The number of Jobseekers Allowance (JSA) and Universal Credit (UC) claimants at December 2022 in the Glenrothes area was 970 representing a 3.2% rate, consistent with the Scottish average, but lower than the Fife and UK averages of 3.4% and 3.7%. Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) figures indicate that Auchmuty, Cadham, Collydean, Macedonia and Tanshall areas in Glenrothes fall within the 20% most deprived communities category in Scotland.

==Economy==

The Glenrothes area&#x27;s economy predominantly comprises manufacturing and engineering industries, service sector, health and public sector jobs. In 2023, around 24,225 people were employed in the Glenrothes area; approximately 18% of the 137,465 jobs in Fife. Glenrothes is recognised for having the main concentration of advanced manufacturing and engineering companies in Fife. There are a total of 46 &quot;Top 200 Fife Businesses&quot; located in Glenrothes and there was a recorded of industrial and business floorpace within the town&#x27;s employment areas following a survey carried out in 2014 with the largest concentrations of premises in the south of the town and around the town centre. Major employment areas in Glenrothes include: Bankhead, Eastfield, Pentland Park, Queensway, Southfield, Viewfield, Westwood Park and Whitehill.

===Industry===

The 2011 census showed that manufacturing accounted for almost 15% of employment in Glenrothes. In 2015 this amounted to over 4,000 jobs in the local area, or almost a third of all manufacturing jobs in Fife. A number of high tech industrial companies are located in the town largely specialised in electronics manufacturing making the Glenrothes area one of Scotland&#x27;s largest clusterings of electronics companies. These are what remain of Silicon Glen operations in the area which gradually reduced and then consolidated since the peak in the late 1990s. Local companies specialised in this sector include Compugraphic which develops photomasks for the microelectronics sector, CTDI (formally Regenersis) which provides technology repair and test services, Leviton (previously Brand Rex) which produces fibre optic cabling, Raytheon which specialises in electronics for the defence industry and Semefab which produces Micro Electric Mechanical Systems (MEMS). Other major companies which have established a base in Glenrothes include Bosch Rexroth (hydraulics manufacturing), FiFab (precision engineering) and Velux (Window and Skylight Manufacturers).

In 2013 Indian beverages group Kyndal entered into a joint venture with John Fergus &amp; Co Ltd to establish a new Scotch whisky distillery and bonded warehouse facility in Glenrothes. The new distillery, named Inchdairnie, focuses on exporting to markets in India, Africa and the Far East. It opened in May 2016 creating 15 new jobs as well as generating new exports worth a predicted £3.6 million to Scotland over the next three years. It is located at Whitehill Industrial Estate adjacent to Fife Airport. The distillery is one of the first in Scotland to embark on a significant decarbonisation programme and was awarded UK Government funding as part of a &#x27;Green Distilleries Competition&#x27; in January 2021. This will specifically focus on the potential to use hydrogen at the distillery to significantly decarbonise the process heat required. The hydrogen could be produced two ways, by converting the gas generated at the local AD plant to hydrogen onsite and through electrolysis of local renewables onsite. This will reduce the overall carbon footprint of the distillery.

Roof window manufacturer Velux announced in October 2018 that it was delivering a £7 million expansion to its UK and Ireland headquarters in Glenrothes. The firm&#x27;s head office building was renovated and a 3,500 square metre new build structure was developed alongside the existing office, housing a customer service centre, training facilities, office space, meeting suite and a staff restaurant. Like the current building, the extension showcases Velux products, such as its modular skylight system, flat roof windows and sun tunnels.

Dutch-owned firm Scotch Whisky Investments (SWI) developed a bonded whisky storage facility in 2023 in Southfield Industrial Estate delivering around 38 full-time jobs. SWI aims to deliver a centre of excellence in Glenrothes for the support of the cask investment and storage market that allows Scotch to age on site, creating high-quality matured whisky. The development comprises whisky storage warehouses, maintenance and bottling buildings and offices. The first phase of development delivered £10 million of inward investment to the town with longer-term development aspirations to expand operations on the site. Alongside its plans for Glenrothes, SWI is also aiming to deliver a new visitor centre that will showcase and educate people about single malt Scotch whisky in nearby Falkland.

===Retail, leisure and service sectors===
Retail jobs accounted for approximately 11% of the total number of jobs in the local economy in 2011. The majority of shopping, retail services and administrative facilities in Glenrothes are concentrated in the town centre (central business district). With approximately 120 shop units, the Kingdom Shopping Centre provides the largest concentration of retail and services in the town centre. New shop and drive-thru units were delivered at North Street between 2018 and 2021 anchored by a M&amp;S foodhall.

Community and commercial leisure facilities within the town centre include the Rothes Halls complex; Glenrothes&#x27; principal theatre, library, civic and exhibition centre. A cinema, restaurant, pub and bingo hall complex are located adjacent to the Kingdom Centre at Carrick Gate/Church Street. Ten-pin bowling facilities are available at Albany Gate. The Gym Group also operate from a facility at Rothesay Place/North Street.

A number of retail operators including the town&#x27;s major supermarkets are also located in the Queensway business park located adjacent to the town centre. The town&#x27;s largest retail employers, Asda and Morrisons, both trade from large stores there. A retail park has also been constructed at the Saltire Centre, approximately half of a mile (1 km) to the southwest of the town centre containing major stores including Matalan and Homebase.

Other types of service industries also add to the town&#x27;s economic mix with large single employers being in the &#x27;accommodation and food services&#x27; sector which accounted for around 4% of the town&#x27;s total jobs. Balbirnie House Hotel, a four star hotel, Balgeddie House Hotel (a Best Western hotel) and Premier Inn, both three stars, are the largest hotels in Glenrothes. Budget hotels include the Golden Acorn Hotel, the Gilvenbank Hotel, a Travelodge and a Holiday Inn Express. Balbirnie House was awarded the &quot;Best Wedding Hotel&quot; Global Award at the Haute Grandeur Global Hotel Awards for five consecutive years between 2019 and 2024.

Financial and professional services represent 15.6% of the total number of jobs. Offices are mainly concentrated in the town centre and at Pentland Park. An enterprise hub facility was opened in the town centre in 2017 to act as a &quot;one-stop shop&quot; supplying increased enterprise and business services to potential entrepreneurs in the local area.

===Public and voluntary sectors===

A number of public service and third sector agencies and authorities are based in Glenrothes contributing to the town&#x27;s administrative centre function. Police Scotland has established its Fife Division headquarters in Glenrothes at Viewfield. Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), Scottish Enterprise and Kingdom Housing Association, a major Registered Social Landlord also have offices in Glenrothes at Pentland Park; a business park within the town. Fife College is also a key employer in Glenrothes with a large campus based at Stenton Road adjacent to Viewfield Industrial Estate. Fife Council is a major employer in the locality with its prominent local authority headquarters building located in Glenrothes town centre. Other council departments are located at a major depot and office facility at Bankhead in the former ADC building.

===Regeneration and future development===

A range of development projects are proposed to regenerate the town centre steered by a masterplan that was approved by the Glenrothes Area Committee in March 2021. This seeks to address a variety of negative trends including addressing the reduction in retail operators and office floorspace in the town centre due to changing market and working requirements and rationalisation of Fife Council&#x27;s office estate. The masterplan also recommends celebrating the unique legacy of public art bequeathed to the town, introducing new business opportunities outwith the Kingdom Shopping Centre, creating new public spaces and meeting areas including a new town square, and supporting an enhanced evening economy. Older parts of the Kingdom Shopping Centre at Albany Gate are proposed to be demolished and redeveloped. A mixed use redevelopment of the former police station site at Napier Road was outlined in the masterplan and proposals for this site were approved by Fife Council in early 2023. Fife Council announced in 2023 its intention to demolish Rothesay House as part of ongoing regeneration activity in the town centre.

Major housing developments are taking place in the area, including at the former Tullis Russell papermills, Cadham Road, Markinch South and at Westwood Park which will collectively deliver over a thousand new build homes between 2022 and 2030.

There are also proposals to support the regeneration of the western neighbourhoods, centered around the Glenwood centre. A charrette was held in 2017, facilitated by PAS and supported by design experts, Fife Council and the Scottish Government to inform an action plan for the future of the area. The Glenwood Centre was subsequently demolished in 2023 making way for the regeneration of the area. Fife Council is replacing the demolished centre with new affordable homes and a community hub facility.

Glenrothes is to be home to the UK&#x27;s First 100% Green Data Centre which is to be built at Queensway Technology Park. Once complete this will represent a significant economic development for the area and will play a strategically important part in Scotland&#x27;s IT infrastructure transformation as a whole. The £40 million development will create over 300 construction jobs during the build process and up to 50 full-time posts created on completion, including technical and operational staff. The facility will be the first of its kind in the UK drawing its energy from a renewable source with power coming directly from the RWE biomass plant in the town. Queensway Data Centre will accommodate up to 1500 high performance computer racks offering the highest levels of resilience and data security. The facility will be built to a BREEAM outstanding standard with a power usage effectiveness rating of less than 1.15.

The UK Government announced in January 2023 that Glenrothes will share £19.4m of Levelling-up funding. The money will go into the River Leven Regeneration project to make it an exemplar for a green economic recovery to meet climate and nature targets, and a just transition to net zero. It will also go to regeneration plans for Glenrothes and Leven town centres. The improvements in Glenrothes Riverside Park include new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, provision of public toilets and an upgraded multi-functional equipped children&#x27;s play park with a giant open-mouthed hippo – described as a play sculpture – at the centre. Improvements will also include a state-of-the art pump track for mountain bikes, BMX bikes, skateboards and scooters, designed by Clark and Kent Contractors, the company behind the London 2012 Olympic BMX track, which will be capable of hosting national and international competitions. The aim is to develop the park into a “must visit” destination for tourists as well as residents. Improvements to the cycle and pedestrian connections to the park including enhanced accessible linkages to the Fife Pilgrim’s Way are also being provided.

Approval was given in December 2024 for the development of a timber and manufacturing facility, a construction skills academy and a crematorium at Southfield. Respect Developments (Scotland) Ltd and Dignity Funerals Ltd who are delivering the project suggest that the development will provide 120 new jobs as part of the skills academy and manufacturing facility, comprising 80 apprentices and 40 factory workers. A total of five classrooms would be provided within the building to accommodate learning opportunities. It is anticipated that around 10-15 new jobs would be provided as part of the crematorium. In addition to jobs when in operation, there will also be a significant amount of construction jobs created.

==Culture and community==
===Public artworks===
In 1968 Glenrothes was the first town in the UK to appoint a town artist. This is now recognised as playing a significant role, both in a Scottish and in an international context, in helping to create the idea of art being a key factor in creating a sense of place. Two town artists, David Harding (1968–78) and Malcolm Robertson (1978–91), were employed in the lifetime of the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC). Both artists, supported by a number of assistants, created a large variety of artworks and sculptures, around 140 pieces, that are scattered throughout the town. Malcolm Robertson produced the &quot;Giant Irises&quot; sculpture as Glenrothes&#x27; contribution to the Glasgow Garden Festival. The sculpture was the winner of the John Brown Clydebank award for the &quot;Most Original and Amusing Artifact&quot; and following the festival, it was re-erected at Leslie Roundabout.

Other artists have also contributed to the creation of the town&#x27;s artworks. The first sculpture erected in Glenrothes was &quot;Ex Terra&quot;, created by Benno Schotz which was inspired by the town&#x27;s motto (Latin) meaning &quot;From the earth strength&quot;. &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot; sculpture in Riverside Park was produced by Edinburgh-based sculptor, Ronald Rae, who was commissioned by the GDC to produce a piece of art work in celebration of the town&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 1988. The concrete hippos scattered throughout the town were designed and created by Stanley Bonnar who went on to be the town artist at East Kilbride.

Four pieces of Glenrothes artworks have been awarded listed status by Historic Environment Scotland. &quot;Ex Terra&quot; has been listed at Category B and &quot;The Birds&quot;, &quot;The Henge&quot; and &quot;Work&quot; (or Industry, Past and Present) at Category C.

Coinciding with the town&#x27;s 75th anniversary on 30 June 2023 a new public artwork was unveiled in the town centre named &quot;The Disappearing Hippo&quot;, created by Stanley Bonnar. It is constructed using recycled tin cans and other sustainable materials bringing a conservation message.

===Civic and heritage facilities===

Rothes Halls is the town&#x27;s main theatre, exhibition, conference and civic centre. The town&#x27;s main library and a cafe also form part of the complex. The Rothes Halls was officially opened by actor and director Richard Wilson on 30 November 1993. Since then it has played host to a vast range of local, national and international shows; popular music and entertainment acts, and amateur societies. It also hosts an annual Kingdom Of Fife Real Ale and Cider Festival, the Glenrothes comic con and a science festival. Some of the exhibits and displays of the former Glenrothes &amp; Area Heritage Centre were relocated into the Rothes Halls after the Heritage Centre closed its unit in the Kingdom Shopping Centre following the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019/2020.

A war memorial was constructed in Glenrothes in 2007 following the deaths of two local Black Watch soldiers in Iraq. Prior to this Glenrothes was in the unusual position of not being able to host its own Remembrance Sunday commemorations. Unlike traditional memorials, the Glenrothes war memorial consists of two interlinking rings of standing stones.

===Community hospital facilities===
Glenrothes Hospital is a community hospital located in the Forresters Lodge area to the northwest of the town centre. Opened in October 1981 the hospital has over 80 nursing staff and over 60 beds, as well as around 20 day hospital beds. Glenrothes Hospital provides a wide range of services including; speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, dietetics, district nurses, health visitors, podiatry, hospital pharmacy and x-ray services. There is, however, no accident and emergency service within this hospital.

===Social clubs, organisations and community events===
There are a number of social clubs and organisations operating within Glenrothes which contribute to the cultural and community offerings of the town. These include an art club, various youth clubs, a floral art club, amateur theatre groups, a choral society and a variety of sports clubs. Glenrothes hosts an annual gala which is held at Warout Park and has a variety of family activities including a dog show, highland dancing and a travelling funfair with stalls. Summer and winter festivals were held in Riverside Park in 2012. The summer festival included sporting events along with arts and crafts, food stalls and fairground shows. The winter festival coincided with bonfire night celebrations and included the town&#x27;s annual fireworks display which was previously held at Warout Park. Markinch and Thornton each host an annual Highland Games and the other surrounding villages host their own annual gala days and festivals.

===Public parks and horticulture===
The town has won numerous awards locally and nationally for the quality of its landscaping; something that is promoted by the &quot;Take a Pride in Glenrothes&quot; (TAPIG) group. The Glenrothes Development Corporation devoted around one third of land in Glenrothes to the provision of open space. As a consequence the town has numerous parks, the largest being Balbirnie Park, Carleton Park, Gilvenbank Park, Riverside Park, and Warout Park. The Lomond Hills Regional Park borders and enters the town to the north and east.

===Sports facilities, clubs and events===
The town has a large variety of established sports and leisure facilities. This includes two 18-hole golf courses (Glenrothes and Balbirnie), outdoor skateparks, an indoor ten-pin bowling alley, a football stadium at Warout Park, private gyms and the Michael Woods Sports and Leisure Centre which is a major sports complex located in Viewfield. The Sports Centre was named after the late SNP Councillor Michael Woods in a controversial decision taken by the Glenrothes Area Committee in 2012. The sports centre was recognised for its architectural quality in the 2014 Scottish Property Awards, coming second place in the Architectural Excellence Award for Public Buildings. In April 2018 a new state-of-the-art indoor training facility was developed adjacent to the Michael Woods Sports and Leisure Centre; the only facility of its kind in Fife. The indoor arena features a 3G football pitch allowing for seven-a-side and five-a-side matches. The facility, which was funded by Fife Council and sportscotland at a cost of £2.3 million, is also compliant for rugby training.

The town&#x27;s football club is Glenrothes F.C., they compete in the East of Scotland League and play at Warout Stadium. The local rugby club is Glenrothes RFC who are based at Carleton Park and there is also a local cricket club who play at Gilvenbank Park. The Road Running Festival in Glenrothes is the largest annual sporting event in the town with over 1500 people of all ages and levels of fitness taking part and has been held annually since 1983. The town is also an established destination in hosting the BDO British International Championships for darts which are held annually at the town&#x27;s CISWO club.

===Town twinning===
Glenrothes has a twin-town link with Böblingen, a city in Baden-Württemberg in Germany since 1971. As early as 1962 a local councillor had suggested that the town might &quot;twin&quot; with a town on the Continent. Some years later a friendship grew up between teachers at Glenrothes High School and the Gymnasium in Böblingen which eventually led to the twinning of the towns. Since then there have been a number of exchanges on official, club and personal levels.

===Notable residents===

*The actor Dougray Scott grew up in Glenrothes and attended Auchmuty High School.
*Douglas Mason, known as one of the engineers of the &quot;Thatcher revolution&quot; and the &quot;father of the poll tax&quot;, set up home in Glenrothes in the 1960s and lived most of his adult life there.
*Henry McLeish, the former First Minister of Scotland, lived in Glenrothes, having been brought up in nearby Kennoway. Glenrothes town centre is home to the building involved in the notorious Officegate scandal, which ultimately led to McLeish&#x27;s resignation as First Minister in 2001.
*Tricia Marwick, the first female Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, served as MSP for Glenrothes.
*John Wallace CBE, born in nearby Methilhill, like many of his extended family played in the Tullis Russell Mills Band; his father worked as a joiner in the late Tullis Russell Paper Mills.

==Landmarks==
The River Leven Bridge, also known locally as the &#x27;White Bridge&#x27;, which spans Riverside Park and carries the town&#x27;s Western Distributor Road, is a cable-stayed bridge that was completed in 1995. The bridge was designed by Dundee-based Nicoll Russell Studios, Architects and was commissioned by the Glenrothes Development Corporation (GDC) as a landmark creating a gateway into Riverside Park that could be seen from further afield. The bridge was constructed by Balfour Beatty Construction (Scotland) and it was the first reinforced-concrete cable-stayed structure ever built in the UK.

A number of Glenrothes&#x27; artworks and sculptures act as landmarks at major gateways into the town, such as the &quot;Giant Irises&quot; at Leslie Roundabout, and the Glenrothes &quot;Gateway Totum&quot; at Bankhead Roundabout. A number of other sculptures were relocated in 2011 to more visually prominent locations around the town creating new landmarks.

The town is also home to a number of churches which act as important landmarks due to their unique architectural styles and sometimes their locations at key road junctions. The three earliest churches are now listed buildings. These are St. Margaret&#x27;s Church in Woodside (category C listed), St. Paul&#x27;s RC Church in Auchmuty (category A listed), and St. Columba&#x27;s Church on Church Street (category A listed) in the town centre. St. Paul&#x27;s RC was designed by architects Gillespie, Kidd and Coia. In 1993 it was listed as one of sixty key monuments of post-war architecture by the international conservation organisation DoCoMoMo. The church sits at a junction between two main distributor roads. St Columba&#x27;s Church, designed by architects Wheeler &amp; Sproson, underwent significant restoration in 2009. Internally the church contains a large mural created by Alberto Morrocco titled &#x27;The Way of the Cross&#x27;, which was completed in 1962. Externally the church with its distinctive triangular iron bell tower and Mondrian inspired stained glass windows acts as a landmark at the south-western gateway to the town centre.

Balgonie Castle located to the east of Glenrothes on the south bank of the River Leven near Milton of Balgonie and Coaltown of Balgonie is a local landmark on the eastern approach to Glenrothes from Levenmouth. The castle keep dates from the 14th century and has been recently restored. The castle was awarded category A listing in 1972 by Historic Scotland.

==Education==
===Primary schools===
Early precincts in the town were served by their own primary schools which were to be provided on the basis of one school for every 1,000 houses. The first primary school to be opened in Glenrothes was Carleton Primary School, built in 1953 in Woodside. In total thirteen primary schools were developed in the town, twelve non-denominational and one to serve catholic pupils. In February 2014 Fife Council&#x27;s executive committee voted to close one of Glenrothes&#x27; primary schools at Tanshall as part of a wider school estate review which sought to reduce costs. The closure faced considerable local opposition and the proposals were called-in by the Scottish Government, but ultimately the closure of the school went ahead as planned and Tanshall Primary School was demolished in 2016.

===Secondary schools===

Secondary Schools were originally to be provided on the basis of one school for every 4,000 houses. Three secondary schools were constructed in Glenrothes, the earliest Auchmuty High School opened in 1957 serving the eastern area of the new town. Glenwood High School was the second secondary to be built in 1962 serving the newer western precincts as the town expanded during that period. Prior to 1966 older pupils had to attend schools in neighbouring towns to continue &quot;Higher&quot; examinations as Auchmuty and Glenwood only provided for pupils at junior secondary level. Glenrothes High School was built in 1966 to accommodate pupils at a higher level. However changes in the education system nationally meant that both Auchmuty and Glenwood were extended and raised to full high school status in the 1970s. Auchmuty High School serves the east and southern parts of Glenrothes as well as the villages of Markinch, Coaltown of Balgonie and Thornton. As part of the £126 million Building Fife&#x27;s Future Project a replacement for Auchmuty was completed and opened to pupils in 2013. Glenrothes High School serves the central and northern areas in the town. Glenwood High School serves the western parts of Glenrothes and the villages of Leslie and Kinglassie. Catholic pupils in Glenrothes attend St Andrew&#x27;s High School in neighbouring Kirkcaldy.

===Further education===

Further education in the town is provided at Fife College. Construction of a Glenrothes college campus began in the early 1970s, originally specialising in paper manufacturing, mechanical engineering and electrical engineering courses. A second institute known as FIPRE (Fife Institute of Physical and Recreational Education) was built adjacent catering for sport and physical education as well as providing a sports centre for the town. The Glenrothes campus of the college is located at Stenton Road in Viewfield. This was significantly extended in 2010 with the development of the &quot;Future Skills Centre&quot;. It includes departments in engineering, construction, renewables and science to cater for emerging industries specialising in renewable energy and low carbon technologies as well as provide training for major engineering projects.

==Transport==
Glenrothes has a planned road network with original masterplans establishing the principle that &quot;through traffic&quot; be bypassed around the housing precincts by a network of &quot;Freeway&quot; and &quot;Highway&quot; distributor roads. These would connect each precinct to the purposely designed town centre and to the industrial estates. Another element that was adopted was the use of roundabouts at junctions instead of traffic lights which would allow traffic to flow freely.

The town has direct dual-carriageway access to the M90 via the A92 Trunk Road. The A92 passes north–south through the town and connects Glenrothes with Dundee in the north and Dunfermline in the southwest where it merges with the M90. This gives Glenrothes a continuous dual-carriageway link to Edinburgh and the major central Scotland road networks, whilst much of the route north to Dundee remains a single-carriageway. Local campaigners have for a number of years sought the upgrade of the A92 north of Glenrothes.

The A911 road passes east/west through the town and connects it with Levenmouth in the east and Milnathort and the M90 in the west. The B921 Kinglassie Road, described in early masterplans as the Southern Freeway, links Glenrothes to the former mining communities of Cardenden and Kinglassie, and to Westfield. The route is a dual carriageway between Bankhead Roundabout and as far west as Fife Airport. Early masterplans show that this route was originally intended to be upgraded to provide dualled connections to the A92 Chapel junction in Kirkcaldy, however this was never implemented.

The town has a major bus station in the town centre providing frequent links to the cities of Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Perth as well as to surrounding towns and villages.

Glenrothes lies on the edge of the Edinburgh–Dundee line and the Fife Circle rail line. Two railway stations on the edge of the main town serve the Glenrothes area - Glenrothes with Thornton railway station and Markinch railway station. Upon designation of the new town in the 1940&#x27;s branch lines operated from Markinch, connecting to Leslie and to the Tullis Russell papermill passing through the new town area. The Leslie branch line closed in 1967 as part of the Beeching cuts and later became Boblingen Way, a pedestrian and cycle route. The Tullis Russell (Auchmuty Mill) branch line closed in 1992 with the majority converted as a pedestrian and cycle route.

Glenrothes is home to an airfield, Fife Airport (ICAO code EGPJ), which is used for general aviation with private light aircraft. Edinburgh Airport is the nearest international airport to Glenrothes and Dundee Airport operates daily flights to London, Belfast and Shetland.

A purposely designed pedestrian and cycle system was also created using a network of ring and radial routes throughout the town. This includes a near three mile continuous linear cycle path, called Boblingen Way, which extends across the length of Glenrothes, from Leslie in the west, to Woodside in the east.

Glenrothes is connected to the National Cycle Network via Route 766 which runs north from Kirkcaldy to north of Glenrothes, linking to the wider network via Route 76 and Route 1. The Fife Pilgrim Way is a long-distance walking route covering a distance of around 64 miles between Culross, connecting a number of Fife&#x27;s villages, towns and countryside and terminating in St Andrews. The route passes through Glenrothes on a section of the route between Kinglassie in the southwest and Markinch in the east.

<text>Puya is a genus of the botanical family Bromeliaceae. It is the sole genus of the subfamily Puyoideae, and is composed of 226 species. These terrestrial plants are native to the Andes Mountains of South America and southern Central America. Many of the species are monocarpic, with the parent plant dying after one flower and seed production event.

The species &quot;Puya raimondii&quot; is notable as the largest species of bromeliad known, reaching 3 m tall in vegetative growth with a flower spike 9–10 m tall. The other species are also large, with the flower spikes mostly reaching 1–4 m tall.

The name &quot;Puya&quot; was derived from the Mapuche Indian word meaning &quot;point&quot;.
==Taxonomy==
The genus is commonly divided into two subgenera, &quot;Puya&quot;, containing eight species, and &quot;Puyopsis&quot; containing the remainder. The subgenera can be distinguished by the presence of a sterile inflorescence at the branch apex in &quot;Puya&quot;, which are fertile in &quot;Puyopsis&quot;.

===Species===
, Plants of the World Online accepted the following species:
==Cultivation and use==
Some species of &quot;Puya&quot; in Chile, locally known as &quot;chagual&quot;, are used to make salads from the base of its young leaves or stem. A common species is &quot;Puya chilensis&quot;.

<text>Score following is the process of automatically listening to a live music performance and tracking the position in the score. It is an active area of research and stands at the intersection of artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, signal processing, and musicology. Score following was first introduced in 1984 independently by Barry Vercoe and Roger Dannenberg. 

Artistically, it is one of the main components for live electronic music of many composers such as Pierre Boulez and Philippe Manoury among others and is currently an active line of research in different communities such as IRCAM in Paris. The latest version of IRCAM&#x27;s score following, developed by the Musical Representations Team is capable of following complex audio signals (monophonic and polyphonic) and synchronize events via the detected tempo of the performance in realtime. It&#x27;s distributed publicly since 2009 under the name Antescofo and has been successfully performed throughout the world for a wide number of contemporary music productions including realtime electronics.

Other score following authors include Chris Raphael, Roger Dannenberg, Barry Vercoe, Miller Puckette, Nicola Orio, Arshia Cont, and Frank Weinstock (; ; ).

For the first time, in October 2006, there is going to be a Score Following evaluation during the second Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange (MIREX). It is expected that most systems participate and compete in live musical situations and the results be announced in public domain.

<doc id="630570" wikidata="Q521933" url="?curid=630570" title="Influence peddling">
<text>Influence peddling, also called traffic of influence or trading in influence, is the practice of using one&#x27;s influence in government or connections with authorities to obtain favours or preferential treatment for another, usually in return for payment. Influence peddling &quot;per se&quot; is not necessarily illegal, as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has often used the modified term &quot;undue influence peddling&quot; to refer to illegal acts of lobbying; however, influence peddling is typically associated with corruption and may therefore delegitimise democratic politics with the general public. It is punishable as a crime in Argentina, Belgium, Bulgaria, Brazil, France, Hungary, Italy, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

== Known cases ==

In December 2008, Rod Blagojevich, the then Governor of Illinois, was accused of influence peddling in attempting to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by the then President-elect Barack Obama. Blagojevich was convicted in 2011 and sentenced to 14 years in prison. He was later pardoned by then-President Donald Trump by February 2020. Larry O&#x27;Brien, the then mayor of Ottawa, was brought to trial on similar grounds in May 2009. O&#x27;Brien was accused of purported influence peddling. On 5 August 2009, both charges were dismissed. 

In April 2009, former Newfoundland and Labrador politician Ed Byrne was convicted of influence peddling for his actions in the Constituency Allowance Scandal. He was the first of four politicians convicted in relation to the Scandal and the remaining politicians are on or awaiting trial. 

In 2012, Amado Boudou, the then vice president of Argentina, was accused of being a mere straw owner of the printing house Ciccone Calcográfica, a private company that has contracts to print over 120 million new Argentine pesos banknotes, license plates, and other government issues. The scandal became known as Boudougate, as the contracts were awarded by Boudou himself when he was the Economy Minister. In 2018, Boudou was convicted of corruption and sentenced to 5 years and 10 months in prison, as well as being banned from running for office. He was granted parole in 2021, 5 years into his sentence

In the Radia tapes controversy of the late 2000s and early 2010, Nira Radia was under investigation for using her connections with Indian politicians and members of the Indian media to tilt the auction of multi-million dollar licence contracts in favour of certain companies and individuals. No major charges were brought against Radia, and the case did not result in convictions.

In 2014, former French President Nicolas Sarkozy was investigated due to alleged influence peddling. Sarkozy was convicted in March 2021 for corruption and influence peddling. He was sentenced to three years in prison, with two years suspended and one year to be served under house arrest.

In April 2015, the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office of Brazil opened an investigation for influence peddling against Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, at the time a former president of Brazil. It was alleged that, between 2011 and 2014, he lobbied for Odebrecht company to gain public procurements in foreign countries while also getting BNDES to finance those projects. Countries where this allegedly took place include Ghana, Angola, Cuba, and the Dominican Republic. Lula was later convicted on separate corruption charges and imprisoned but was released in 2019 after Brazil&#x27;s Supreme Court annulled his sentences. In 2022, Lula was re-elected as president of Brazil.

On 9 December 2016, the National Assembly impeached Park Geun-hye, the president of South Korea from 2013 to 2017, on charges related to influence peddling by her top aide Choi Soon-sil, and Hwang Kyo-ahn, the then Prime Minister of South Korea, assumed her powers and duties as Acting President as a result. The Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the impeachment by a unanimous 8–0 ruling on 10 March 2017, thereby removing Park from office.. On 6 April 2018, South Korean courts sentenced her to 24 years in prison; this was later increased to 25 years, and Park was imprisoned at Seoul Detention Center. In 2018, two separate criminal cases resulted in an increase of seven years in her prison sentence. She was found guilty of illegally taking off-the-book funds from the National Intelligence Service and given a five-year prison sentence, and also found guilty of illegally interfering in the Saenuri Party primaries in the 2016 South Korean legislative election, for which she was sentenced to two more years in prison.

<text>Acusilaus, Acusilas, Acousileos, or Akousilaos () of Argos, son of Cabas or Scabras, was a Greek logographer and mythographer who lived in the latter half of the 6th century BC but whose work survives only in fragments and summaries of individual points. He is one of the authors (= &quot;FGrHist&quot; 2) whose fragments were collected in Felix Jacoby&#x27;s &quot;Die Fragmente der griechischen Historiker&quot;.

Acusilaus was called the son of Cabras or Scabras, and it is not known whether he was of Peloponnesian or Boeotian Argos. Possibly there were two of the name. He is reckoned by some among the Seven Sages of Greece.

According to the &quot;Suda&quot;, Acusilaus wrote genealogies (c. 500 BC). Three books of his genealogies are quoted, which were for the most part only a translation of Hesiod into prose. Acusilaus claimed to have taken some of his information from bronze tablets discovered in his garden which were inscribed with information, a source looked upon with suspicion by some modern commentators. As with most of the other logographers, he wrote in the Ionic dialect. Plato is the earliest writer by whom he is mentioned. The works which bore the name of Acusilaus in a later age were spurious.

<text>Mutaga IV Mbikije ( – 30 November 1915) was the king of Burundi from 21 August 1908 until 30 November 1915. He was the son of Mwami Mwezi IV. 
He inherited the throne at the age of 15, after his father died in 1908, under the regnal name of Mutaga. Being too young to ensure continuity, he ruled with the help of a regency council consisting of another wife of his father, Ririkumutima, and a half-brother of this father, Ntanigera. Mutaga IV died prematurely in November 1915 after a fight that supposedly pitted him against his younger brother, Prince Bangura.

He had two sons:

* Mwambutsa IV Bangiricenge
* Prince Ignace Kamatari (died 1964), father of Princess Esther Kamatari

His stepmother, Ririkumutima, served as regent for much of his reign.

Belka said he would not resign over the remarks he is alleged to have made. The secret recordings were believed to have been made in one or more restaurants in the capital, Warsaw, and thought to date back as far as Summer 2013.

<doc id="630583" wikidata="Q431156" url="?curid=630583" title="Mwezi IV of Burundi">
<text>King Mwami Mwezi IV Gisabo Bikata-Bijoga (c. 1840–1908) was the last independent ruler of Burundi before its colonization by the German Empire.

== Biography ==
He ascended to the throne in 1850 after succeeding his father. Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba who was the King of Burundi until 1850. Mwezi IV would continue to reign up until his death in 1908, when he would be succeeded by his son Mutaga IV Mbikije. 
===Pre-colonisation reign===
In his position as king of Burundi, he was seen as the ‘Father’ of the Nation, a figure seen as more religious than political, who was revered as a mystical figure. Mwezi was one of the younger sons of Ntare, he came to power under the regency of his older brother, and there was some question of his own parentage. This would end up leading to a struggle with his older brothers in order to retain his claim to kingship. During the more than fifty-year reign of King Mwezi IV, a four-tiered system of administration emerged in order to help govern the country of Burundi more effectively. A central area around the Muramvya Province was under the direct control of the king; an area under the administration of his sons or brothers, which was most closely allied to him; a broad area further east and south that was administered by Batare chiefs, who were descendants of Ntare IV of Burundi: and a final zone that covered the west and northwestern areas of the country and was under the administration of other, mostly Hutu authorities. This method of leadership ended up in multiple revolts in attempts to overthrow Mwezi Gisabo, with the principal actors in these revolts often being the sons and grandsons of Ndivyariye, an older brother of Mwezi Gisabo. The issue of governance in Burundi concerned the ways in which the society was governed and how it was presently governed, the distribution of the contested authority and resources in the society, and most importantly to what level of degree were the political leaders seen as a legitimate leader with authority in the eyes of Burundian society. The sources of power in Burundi had always been authority, human resources, skills and knowledge, intangible psychological and ideological factors, and material resources and sanctions, and when legitimacy of a leader did not exist or was thrown into doubt, the result was political turmoil and social unrest. Mwezi IV was forced to control a number of new forms of political intrusion that threatened to undermine his power as king and his control over Burundi. He was forced to deal with attacks by African actors from the east (such as Mirambo), as well as threats from the commercial power associated with the east coast Swahili networks, and direct European intervention in his country. In 1884 he led the Burundian army in battle against slave traders led by Rumaliza along the Kivu-Tanganyika road, inflicting a major defeat upon his opponents and stopping their incursion into Burundi.
===German colonisation and continued rule===
There were some Burundian figures that allied themselves with the German colonial empire in exchange for their help seizing King Mwezi. The powerful individuals that betrayed their king were to be rewarded with important or prominent administrative positions that had political power of their own, the most prominent of these being Inanga Maconco. Maconco was originally the son-in-law of Mwezi, who became an early ally to him after marrying one of Mwezi&#x27;s daughters. After she died, Maconco allied himself with the German forces as they sought to capture Mwezi, and in exchange the Germans promised him a prominent administrative position. However, he was arrested and hanged by the Germans after he was accused of stealing a gun. The German forces along with some of the Burundi that had allied themselves with the Europeans, including Maconco, drove Mwezi from his compound and were able to force him into an agreement. The contents of this 1890 agreement were that King Mwezi be forced to recognize German authority, respect the presence of foreign missionaries, and accept the administrative authority of German allies (such as those who betrayed him like Maconco) in certain areas. However, in exchange for this, the Germans would support Mwezi as the continued King of Burundi. The year 1890 would also see the country of Burundi, along with Rwanda and Tanganyika, become part of the German East Africa. Although this occurred under the reign of Mwezi, the German Protectorate of East Africa was a short-lived venture for the Germans, as they ended up losing all of their colonies, Burundi included, as one of the consequences resulting from World War I.

<doc id="630584" wikidata="Q785104" url="?curid=630584" title="Xenoglossy">
<text>Xenoglossy (), also written xenoglossia () and sometimes also known as xenolalia, is the supposedly paranormal phenomenon in which a person is allegedly able to speak, write or understand a foreign language that they could not have acquired by natural means. The term derives from the Ancient Greek (), &quot;foreigner&quot; and (), &quot;tongue&quot; or &quot;language&quot;. The term &quot;xenoglossy&quot; was first used by French parapsychologist Charles Richet in 1905. Accounts of xenoglossy are found in the New Testament, and contemporary claims have been made by parapsychologists and reincarnation researchers such as Ian Stevenson. Doubts have been expressed that xenoglossy is an actual phenomenon, and there is no scientifically admissible evidence supporting any of the alleged instances of xenoglossy.

Two types of xenoglossy are distinguished. Recitative xenoglossy is the use of an unacquired language incomprehensibly, while responsive xenoglossy refers to the ability to intelligibly employ the unlearned language as if already acquired. 

==Christianity==
This phenomenon is mentioned in Acts of the Apostles chapter 2 at Pentecost, when the first disciples of Jesus Christ, gathered together, numbering one hundred and twenty, and of the &quot;tongues&quot; of fire landed on each of them, formalizing the coming of the Spirit in an episode of inspired communication that allows the disciples to express themselves in languages other than Galilean and to be understood by strangers. Several accounts of miraculous abilities of some people to read, write, speak or understand a foreign language as mentioned in the Bible have been related in similar Christian accounts in the Middle Ages. Similar claims were also made by some Pentecostal theologians in 1901.

==Spiritualism==
Claims of mediums speaking foreign languages were made by Spiritualists in the 19th century. More recent claims of xenoglossy have come from reincarnation researchers who have alleged that individuals were able to recall a language spoken in a past life. Some reports of xenoglossy have surfaced in the popular press, such as Czech speedway rider Matěj Kůs who in September 2007 supposedly awoke after a crash and was able to converse in perfect English; however press reports of his fluency in English were based entirely on anecdotal stories told by his Czech teammates. Xenoglossy has been claimed to have occurred during exorcisms.

==Notable claims==

===Ian Stevenson===
Canadian parapsychologist and psychiatrist at the University of Virginia Ian Stevenson claimed there were a handful of cases that suggested evidence of xenoglossy. These included two where a subject under hypnosis could allegedly converse with people speaking the foreign language, instead of merely being able to recite foreign words. Sarah Thomason, a linguist at the University of Michigan, reanalyzed these cases, concluding that &quot;the linguistic evidence is too weak to provide support for the claims of xenoglossy&quot;.
* When Stevenson investigated an American housewife known as &quot;T. E&quot; who exhibited the male personality of a Swedish farmer named &quot;Jensen Jacoby&quot; while under hypnosis, he reported that the subject was able to converse in Swedish, albeit not fluently. However, Thomason&#x27;s reanalysis concluded that &quot;Jensen&quot; could not convincingly be claimed to speak Swedish; writing that though &quot;Jensen&quot; had a total vocabulary of about 100 words, &quot;this is not very impressive when compared with the thousands of words known by any native speaker of any natural language, even taking into account the limited contexts in which Jensen spoke Swedish.&quot; Thomason found that &quot;Jensen&quot; gave no complex sentences, mostly giving one or two word answers, and concluded, &quot;[Stevenson&#x27;s] demonstration that there was no fraud in the case is convincing, but his claim that Jensen had the capacity to speak Swedish is not.&quot; Linguist William Samarin drew the same conclusion as Thomason.
* Stevenson investigated another American woman named Dolores Jay who exhibited the personality of a German teenage girl named &quot;Gretchen&quot; while hypnotized. He claimed that the subject was able to converse in German. Thomason&#x27;s reanalysis, while acknowledging that the evidence against fraud was convincing, concluded that &quot;Gretchen&quot; could not converse fluently in German and that her speech was largely the repetition of German questions with different intonation, or utterances of one or two words. Thomason found that the German vocabulary of &quot;Gretchen&quot; was &quot;minute&quot; and her pronunciation was &quot;spotty&quot;, adding that Dolores Jay had some previous exposure to German in TV programs and had looked at a German book.

William J. Samarin, a linguist from the University of Toronto, argues that Stevenson interacted with linguists in a selective and unprofessional manner, noting that Stevenson corresponded with one linguist for a period of six years &quot;without raising any discussion about the kinds of thing that linguists would need to know,&quot; and that most of Stevenson&#x27;s collaborators were &quot;fellow believers&quot; in the paranormal.

In a review of Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Unlearned Language: New Studies in Xenoglossy&quot; (1984), William Frawley wrote that Stevenson was too uncritically accepting of a paranormal interpretation of the cases. In one case, a female subject could only answer yes-or-no questions in German, which Frawley found unimpressive. In another, the female subject could speak Bengali with poor pronunciation. Frawley noted that she was raised in the language of Marathi (related to Bengali), had studied Sanskrit from which both Marathi and Bengali derive, and was living in a town with thousands of Bengalis. He concluded: &quot;Stevenson does not consider enough linguistic evidence in these cases to warrant his metaphysics.&quot;

Psychologist David Lester evaluated Stevenson&#x27;s cases and wrote the subjects made grammatical mistakes, mispronounced words, and did not show a wide vocabulary of words in foreign language; he thus concluded that they cannot be considered evidence for xenoglossy.

===Alfred Hulme===

In the early 20th century, Alfred Hulme, a self-proclaimed Egyptologist, investigated a young girl named Ivy Carter Beaumont (also known as &quot;Rosemary&quot;) from Blackpool, England, who claimed to be under the influence of the personality of a Babylonian princess. Hulme was convinced she spoke in an ancient Egyptian dialect. However, according to linguist Karen Stollznow, &quot;Several scholars examined the data independently and concluded that Hulme&#x27;s analyses were grossly inaccurate. Hulme had confused Middle Egyptian and Late Egyptian&quot; and likely &quot;falsified many results.&quot;

=== Eberhardt Gmelin ===
In 1791 Eberhardt Gmelin, a German physician often credited with discovering dissociative identity disorder, published a report entitled &quot;Materialien für die Anthropologie&quot;, in which he described a case of a 20-year-old German woman from the town of Stuttgart who would &quot;exchange&quot; her personality for that of a French aristocrat. During these &quot;French&quot; states, as Gmelin termed them, she was able to speak French perfectly, despite never having visited a francophone country or been taught the language, and speak her own native tongue, German, with a French accent. However, this cannot be accepted as an example of xenoglossy, as the woman had probably picked up bits of the language from aristocratic refugees who had arrived at Stuttgart in 1789, the beginning of the French Revolution.

== Explanations ==
Most cases of recitative xenoglossy have been interpreted as instances of cryptomnesia, where memories of a language acquired earlier in life re-enter the consciousness in certain exceptional circumstances.

<doc id="630585" wikidata="Q7593475" url="?curid=630585" title="St James's Theatre">
<text>The St James&#x27;s Theatre was in King Street, St James&#x27;s, London. It opened in 1835 and was demolished in 1957. The theatre was conceived by and built for a popular singer, John Braham; it lost money and after three seasons he retired. A succession of managements over the next forty years also failed to make it a commercial success, and the St James&#x27;s acquired a reputation as an unlucky theatre. It was not until 1879–1888, under the management of the actors John Hare and Madge and W. H. Kendal that the theatre began to prosper.

The Hare-Kendal management was succeeded, after brief and disastrous attempts by other lessees, by that of the actor-manager George Alexander, who was in charge from 1891 until his death in 1918. Under Alexander the house gained a reputation for programming that was adventurous without going too far for the tastes of London society. Among the plays he presented were Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; (1892) and &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1895), and A.W.Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1893).

After Alexander&#x27;s death the theatre came under the control of a succession of managements. Among the long-running productions were &quot;The Last of Mrs Cheyney&quot; (1925), &quot;Interference&quot; (1927), &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot; (1933) and &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1939). In January 1950 Laurence Olivier and his wife Vivien Leigh took over the management of the theatre. Their successes included &quot;Venus Observed&quot; (1950) and for the 1951 Festival of Britain season &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;.

In 1954 Terence Rattigan&#x27;s &quot;Separate Tables&quot; began a run of 726 performances, the longest in the history of the St James&#x27;s. During the run it emerged that a property developer had acquired the freehold of the theatre and obtained the requisite legal authority to knock it down and replace it with an office block. Despite widespread protests the theatre closed in July 1957 and was demolished in December of that year.

==History==
===Background and construction===
In 1878 &quot;Old and New London&quot; commented that the St James&#x27;s Theatre owed its existence &quot;to one of those unaccountable infatuations which stake the earnings of a lifetime upon a hazardous speculation&quot;. John Braham, a veteran operatic star, planned a theatre in the fashionable St James&#x27;s area, on a site in King Street, bounded by Crown Passage to the west, Angel Court to the east and buildings in Pall Mall to the south. A hotel called Nerot&#x27;s had stood there since the 17th century but was by now abandoned and decaying. To generate income, the façade would incorporate one or two shops. Building and opening the theatre were not straightforward. The Theatres Trust comments that Braham quarrelled regularly with his architect, Samuel Beazley, and other professional advisers and contractors. He also faced difficulties in obtaining the necessary licence to open a theatre; the management of the nearby Theatre Royal, Haymarket opposed it, as did other interested parties. The licence was issued by the Lord Chamberlain on the instructions of William IV, but Braham continued to encounter opposition from rivals.

The theatre, which cost Braham £28,000, was designed with a neo-classical exterior and a Louis XIV style interior built by the partnership of Grissell and Peto. The frontage was in three bays, three storeys high, with shops in each outer bay. The façade had a four-column Ionic portico, a balustraded balcony and a two-storey loggia topped by a tall sheer attic. The interior was decorated by the Frederick Crace Company of Wigmore Street, London. After the opening, &quot;The Times&quot; described it in detail:
:The prevailing colour is a delicate French white. A border of flowers, richly embossed in gold, runs round the dress circle, and has a tasteful and elegant effect. The panels of the boxes in the front of the first circle are ornamented by designs, in the style of Watteau, placed in gilded frames of fanciful workmanship. … The front of the slips and gallery are distinguished by neat gold ornaments, relieved by handsome medallions. The proscenium, which, like that of Covent-garden, is shell-form, is painted in compartments, where the loves and graces are depicted gaily disporting. Two slender fluted Corinthian columns, supported on pedestals of imitative marble, add greatly to the beauty of the stage-boxes. A series of arches, supporting the roof, and sustained by caryatides, runs entirely round the upper part of the theatre. ... The &quot;tout ensemble&quot; of the house is light and brilliant. It looks like a fairy palace. Then, the two great points which are most important to the comfort of an audience – hearing and seeing – have been sedulously consulted; and, with reference to them, we think that the new theatre takes the lead of all its brethren.

===Early years: 1835–1857===
The theatre opened on 14 December 1835 with a triple bill consisting of two farces by Gilbert à Beckett and an opera, &quot;Agnes Sorel&quot;, with music by his wife, Mary Anne à Beckett. This ran for a month before being replaced by one of the few successes of Braham&#x27;s tenure, another bill containing an operetta – &quot;Monsieur Jacques&quot; – and a farce, &quot;The Strange Gentleman&quot;, by &quot;Boz&quot; (Charles Dickens). In April 1836 the first of many visiting French companies played at the theatre, a tradition that endured intermittently throughout the 122-year existence of the St James&#x27;s. 

The theatre did not attract the public in the numbers Braham had expected; in addition to its unexciting programmes it was felt to be too far west to appeal to theatregoers. Braham struggled financially and after three seasons he gave up. John Hooper, previously Braham&#x27;s stage director, ran the theatre for four months in 1839. His programmes included the presentation of performing lions, monkeys, dogs and goats. In November 1839 Alfred Bunn, whom the theatre critic and historian J. C. Trewin called a former &quot;autocrat of Drury Lane and Covent Garden&quot;, took over the house, and changed its name to &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Theatre&quot; in honour of the Prince Consort. Among Bunn&#x27;s early offerings was a season of German opera, beginning with &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. Queen Victoria and the Prince Consort came to two performances during the season, but otherwise Bunn&#x27;s tenure was undistinguished and unprofitable.

The theatre was dark for most of 1841. In 1842 John Mitchell (1806–1874), a bookseller and founder of the Bond Street Ticket Agency, took over, reverted the name to the original, and ran the St James&#x27;s for twelve years, with much artistic success but little financial return. He presented French plays with the greatest stars of the Parisian stage, including Rachel, Jeanne Plessy, Virginie Déjazet and Frédérick Lemaître. He also engaged a French opera company, which opened in January 1849 with &quot;Le domino noir&quot;, and followed with &quot;L&#x27;ambassadrice&quot;, &quot;La dame blanche&quot;, &quot;Richard Coeur-de-Lion&quot;, &quot;Le chalet&quot; and many other popular French works. In between French offerings, Mitchell occasionally sub-let the theatre. In 1846, an amateur performance of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Every Man in his Humour&quot; included Dickens playing Captain Bobadil. Mitchell had a fondness for international entertainments, and presented German conjurors, Tyrolean singers, dramatic readings by Fanny Kemble, P. T. Barnum&#x27;s infant prodigies – Kate and Ellen Bateman, aged eight and six – in scenes from Shakespeare, and, most popular of all, the Ethiopian Serenaders who enthused London about the American-style minstrel shows, a form of entertainment that remained popular for decades.

After Mitchell left, the actress Laura Seymour (1820–1879) ran the theatre for a season in association with Charles Reade, from October 1854 to March 1855. Under Seymour&#x27;s management the interior was remodelled, replacing the first tier of boxes with the now more fashionable dress circle. Among the few notable aspects of her tenure was the London debut of the comic actor J. L. Toole. The house was once again dark for most of 1856, but in 1857 the theatre returned to royal and public favour when Jacques Offenbach brought his opéra bouffe company from Paris, with a repertoire of nine of his works. This was followed by the Christy Minstrels who played to good houses for two weeks in August 1857 before moving to other venues.

===Five managements: 1858–1869===

Following this the theatre had a succession of managements. F. B. Chatterton became the lessee for two years from 1858. He presented a season, mainly of Shakespeare, by the popular actor Barry Sullivan, and staged F. C. Burnand&#x27;s first major play, a burlesque called &quot;Dido&quot;, which ran for 80 performances. Alfred Wigan, who had been a member of Braham&#x27;s original company, briefly took over the house in 1860, and was succeeded, equally briefly, by George Vining. Under Frank Matthews, who took over in December 1862, the theatre had its longest-running production thus far: &quot;Lady Audley&#x27;s Secret&quot;, which ran for 104 nights. Matthews ended his tenancy in July 1863 and was followed by Benjamin Webster, who mounted a series of revivals and a few new burlesques and extravaganzas, which were financially unsuccessful.

A member of Webster&#x27;s company, Ruth Herbert, took over in 1864 and ran the theatre until 1868. She attracted much praise for presenting Henry Irving in his first important appearance on a London stage. His performance in Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;Hunted Down&quot; in November 1866 caused a sensation. The following month the theatre presented W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s first burlesque, &quot;Dulcamara! or, The Little Duck and the Great Quack&quot;, a parody of Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;, which ran until Easter the following year. The Herbert management ended in April 1868. The theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope writes:
:She had done nobly and had earned widespread praise. She had kept the theatre open and had brought at least two young people, both destined for greatness, to the notice of the London public – Henry Irving and Charles Wyndham. But the St James&#x27;s had lost her a lot of money. 
The season after her departure was notable for two Offenbach productions in which Hortense Schneider starred, bringing the Prince of Wales and London society to the theatre in June 1868.

===Mrs John Wood; Marie Litton and others: 1869–1878===

In 1869 the theatre was taken by Mrs John Wood, whose first production was &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot;, which ran for 160 performances – a long run for the time. It was beaten by &quot;La Belle Sauvage&quot; which opened in November 1869 and ran for 197 nights. There were successful productions of John Poole&#x27;s &quot;Paul Pry&quot;, &quot;Fernande&quot; (in which Fanny Brough made her London debut), &quot;Anne Bracegirdle&quot;, and &quot;Jenny Lind at Last&quot;. The theatre was well patronised and appeared to be finally prospering. But expenses outran receipts, and Wood gave up the management of the theatre in 1871, and went to the US to replenish her funds.

In 1875 another actress, Marie Litton, took the theatre. She had made her name in management, founding and running the Court Theatre, with which Gilbert&#x27;s works had become closely, and profitably, associated. In one of her productions at the St James&#x27;s, a work by Gilbert, &quot;Tom Cobb&quot;, was in a triple-bill with &quot;The Zoo&quot;, a short comic opera with music by Arthur Sullivan. Another of Litton&#x27;s productions was a double bill of revivals of Frank Marshall&#x27;s farce &quot;Brighton&quot; and William Brough&#x27;s burlesque &quot;Conrad and Medora&quot;, in which she co-starred with Henrietta Hodson. When Litton left for another theatre in 1876, first Horace Wigan, and then Mrs John Wood made brief returns to management at the St James&#x27;s, the latter with some success in &quot;The Danischeffs&quot;, which ran to good houses for more than 300 performances. She was succeeded by Samuel Hayes, who produced three failures in quick succession and then withdrew.

===John Hare and the Kendals: 1879–1888===

The owner of the freehold of the theatre, Lord Newry, began to take an active interest in its affairs. He invited the actor John Hare to take over, which he did, in 1879, in partnership with two fellow-actors, Madge Kendal and her husband William. The theatre was again extensively renovated, with new decor by Walter Crane. &quot;The Era&quot; commented that the new management was in possession of &quot;a house which, for taste and elegance, and comfort, is far in advance of anything the Metropolis has yet been able to boast.&quot;

A historian of the St James&#x27;s, Barry Duncan, heads his chapter on this phase of the theatre&#x27;s history, &quot;John Hare and the Kendals: Nine Years of Steady Success&quot;. For the first time, the theatre&#x27;s reputation as &quot;unlucky&quot; was steadily defied. The new lessees aimed both to amuse and to improve public taste, and in the view of the theatre historian J. P. Wearing, they achieved their aim, with a successful mixture of French adaptations and original English plays.

Under their management the St James&#x27;s staged twenty-one plays: seven were new British pieces, eight French adaptations, and the rest were revivals. Their first production on 4 October 1879 was a revival of G. W. Godfrey&#x27;s &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Shilling&quot;. This was followed in December by Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;The Falcon&quot;, based on the &quot;Decameron&quot;, in which Madge Kendal made a considerable successes as Lady Giovanna.

Wearing regards &quot;The Money Spinner&quot; (1881) as of particular importance to this period of the theatre&#x27;s history, being the first of several of A. W. Pinero&#x27;s plays staged there by Hare and the Kendals. It was regarded as daringly unconventional and a risky venture, but it caught on with the public, partly for Hare&#x27;s character, the &quot;disreputable but delightful old reprobate and card-shark&quot; Baron Croodle. Other plays by Pinero given by the Hare-Kendal management at the St James&#x27;s were &quot;The Squire&quot; (1881), &quot;The Ironmaster&quot; (1884), &quot;Mayfair&quot; (1885), and &quot;The Hobby Horse&quot; (1886).

B. C. Stephenson&#x27;s comedy &quot;Impulse&quot; (1883) was a considerable success and was revived by public demand two months after the end of its first run. The reception of a rare excursion into Shakespeare, &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1885), was mixed. Hare&#x27;s Touchstone was considered by some to be the worst ever seen, whereas Madge Kendal&#x27;s Rosalind had always been one of her best-loved roles. Among the company in these years the actresses included Fanny Brough, Helen Maud Holt, and the young May Whitty; among their male colleagues were George Alexander, Allan Aynesworth, Albert Chevalier, Henry Kemble, William Terris, Brandon Thomas and Lewis Waller.

In a speech at the end of the final night of the Hare-Kendal management, Kendal commented that they had enjoyed more successes and fewer failures than managements of most theatres. But the St James&#x27;s reputation for ill-luck was not yet finished.

===Rutland Barrington; Lillie Langtry: 1888–1890===

In 1888 the comic singer and actor Rutland Barrington became lessee of the theatre. He recruited a talented company, giving Olga Nethersole, Julia Neilson, Allan Aynesworth and Lewis Waller their London debuts, but met financial disaster when his first two – and in the event his only – productions, &quot;The Dean&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Sydney Grundy and &quot;Brantinghame Hall&quot; by Gilbert, were both complete failures. Barrington lost £4,500, went bankrupt, and surrendered the lease in January 1889. The theatre stayed dark for the rest of the year.

Lillie Langtry took a year&#x27;s lease from January 1890. She reopened the house on 24 February, playing Rosalind in a production of &quot;As You Like It&quot; attended by the Prince and Princess of Wales. She followed this with a melodramatic new play, &quot;Esther Sandraz&quot;, adapted from the French by Grundy, which played with a curtain-raiser, a musical farce by Burnand and Edward Solomon, &quot;The Tiger&quot;. Langtry fell ill with pleurisy and had to abandon the season in June. Arthur Bourchier, who had been playing in her company, took on the remainder of the lease, presenting &quot;Your Wife&quot;, an English version of a French farce, but poor box-office takings forced him to close the piece within a month. The lease was taken up by a French company who presented a season of plays in the latter months of the year. Poor attendance again forced the premature closure of the run.

===George Alexander: 1890–1918===

In 1891 the actor George Alexander, who had begun a managerial career a year earlier, took a lease of the St James&#x27;s. He remained in charge there until his death in 1918. He redecorated it and had electric lighting installed. He opened with a double bill of comedies, &quot;Sunlight and Shadow&quot; and &quot;The Gay Lothario&quot;. He followed this with &quot;The Idler&quot;, by Haddon Chambers, a serious drama. It had already been a success in America and ran at the St James&#x27;s through most of the remainder of the season, which concluded with a costume drama, &quot;Moliere&quot;, by Walter Frith. When Alexander took over the St James&#x27;s he had only eleven years&#x27; professional experience in the theatre, but the historians J. P. Wearing and A. E. W. Mason both note that he had already reached a firm and enduring managerial policy. He sought to engage the best actors for his company: unlike some star actor-managers he did not wish to be supported by actors whose inferior talent would make the star look better. Among the actresses he engaged for his companies were Lilian Braithwaite, Constance Collier, Kate Cutler, Julia Neilson, Juliette Nesville, Marion Terry and Irene and Violet Vanbrugh. Their male colleagues included Arthur Bourchier, H. V. Esmond, Cyril Maude, Godfrey Tearle and Fred Terry.

Two key features of Alexander&#x27;s management were his continual support of British playwrights; and his care to avoid alienating his key clientele, the fashionable society audience. The writer Hesketh Pearson commented that Alexander catered to the tastes and foibles of London Society in its theatre-going just as the Savoy Hotel catered to them in restaurant-going.

Within a year of taking over the St James&#x27;s, Alexander began a mutually beneficial professional association with Oscar Wilde, whose &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; he presented in February 1892. The following year he produced Pinero&#x27;s, &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot;, presented in May 1893. Like &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot; it featured &quot;a woman with a past&quot;, but unlike Wilde&#x27;s play it ended in tragedy. It was thought daring at the time, but Alexander knew his audiences and kept to what Pearson called his &quot;safe path of correct riskiness&quot;. It ran for 227 performances in its first production and was later much revived. The title role was first played by Mrs Patrick Campbell, who made her name in the part.
Between Pinero&#x27;s play and the work with which Alexander&#x27;s name has become most closely associated – &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; – came Alexander&#x27;s most conspicuous failure. The celebrated novelist Henry James had written a play, &quot;Guy Domville&quot;, about a hero who renounces the priesthood to save his family by marrying to produce an heir, but finally reverts to his religious calling. The play had been turned down by one London management, but Alexander took it on and opened it at the St James&#x27;s on 5 January 1895. It was received politely by those in the more expensive parts of the house and impolitely by those in the cheaper seats. The reviews were unenthusiastic; Alexander kept the play on the bill for a month before turning to Wilde as a more theatrically adept writer.

In February 1895 Alexander presented Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. The success of the play with audiences and critics was immediate and considerable, but it was short-lived. Within weeks of the premiere Wilde was arrested on a charge of committing homosexual acts and was tried, convicted and imprisoned. The public turned against him, and although Alexander tried to keep the production of the play going by removing the author&#x27;s name from the playbills, he had to withdraw it after 83 performances. Under Alexander, the St James&#x27;s did not solely concentrate on drawing-room comedy and society drama. There were costume dramas, including the Ruritanian swashbuckler, &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot;, which ran for 255 performances; and occasional ventures into Shakespeare, notably &quot;As You Like It&quot;, with Alexander as Orlando, Julia Neilson as Rosalind and a supporting cast that included C. Aubrey Smith, Bertram Wallis, H. B. Irving, Robert Loraine and H. V. Esmond. 

At the end of 1899 Alexander closed the theatre to have it largely reconstructed, producing what &quot;The Era&quot; called &quot;one of the handsomest temples of the drama in London&quot;, while retaining its charm and cosiness. The rebuilding provided increased seating capacity, which enhanced the financial viability of the theatre. The decor was by Percy Macquoid, carried out by the leading London decorators Messrs. Morant and Co. It reopened on 2 February 1900 with a performance of &quot;Rupert of Hentzau&quot; by Anthony Hope attended by the Prince of Wales. The &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; agreed that the redeveloped theatre was &quot;now one of the handsomest in London&quot;. Alexander&#x27;s management continued into the new century, continuing to vary the repertory with, in 1902, a verse drama, &quot;Paolo and Francesca&quot;, based on an episode in Dante&#x27;s &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, as well as the theatre&#x27;s more usual fare such as Pinero&#x27;s drama &quot;His House in Order&quot;, an artistic and box-office success, running for 427 performances. In 1909 Alexander successfully revived &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;, which ran for 316 performances. In 1913 he sub-let the theatre to Harley Granville Barker for four months. Among the novelties of that season was Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Androcles and the Lion&quot; in 1913.

===1918–1939===

After Alexander died in 1918, the lease was taken over by Gilbert Miller, an American impresario, who presented his own productions from time to time, but more often sub-let the theatre to other managers. The first was Gertrude Elliott who presented and starred in an American fantasy play, &quot;The Eyes of Youth&quot;, which ran for 383 performances. After this, Miller went into partnership with the actor Henry Ainley, and in 1920 they presented &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, with Ainley as Mark Antony and a cast including Basil Gill, Claude Rains, Milton Rosmer and Lilian Braithwaite, which ran for 83 performances. There followed a succession of society dramas and light comedies including &quot;Polly With a Past&quot; (1921) in which many future stars appeared, including Helen Haye, Edith Evans and Noël Coward. In 1923 &quot;The Green Goddess&quot;, a melodrama by William Archer, started a run of 417 performances.

During the 1920s, the St James&#x27;s staged Christmas seasons of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; with Peter played by Edna Best (1920 and 1922) and Jean Forbes-Robertson (1929), and Captain Hook by Ainley (1920), Ernest Thesiger (1921), Lyn Harding (1922), and Gerald du Maurier (1929).

In September 1925 du Maurier and Gladys Cooper took a sub-lease of the theatre to present &quot;The Last of Mrs Cheyney&quot; by Frederick Lonsdale (1925), which ran for 514 performances, until the end of 1926. &quot;Interference&quot; (1927), a thriller by Roland Pertwee and Harold Dearden, was another big success and ran for 412 performances. It was followed by a flop, &quot;S.O.S&quot; (1928), notable only for starring Gracie Fields in her first straight part. In 1929, Alfred Lunt made his London debut, starring with his wife Lynn Fontanne in &quot;Caprice&quot;, presented by C. B. Cochran, a comedy about a man, his two mistresses, and his son by one of them who falls in love with the other.

In the early 1930s there was a succession of failures or minimal successes until 1933, when Emlyn Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Late Christopher Bean&quot; ran from May until September of the following year, with Edith Evans, Louise Hampton and Cedric Hardwicke. In 1936 the centenary of the theatre was marked by a lavishly staged adaptation of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, designed by Rex Whistler, which ran for nearly a year. It was presented by Miller in association with Max Gordon and starred Celia Johnson and Hugh Williams. Of the later productions during the 1930s only &quot;Golden Boy&quot; (1938) and &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; (1939) ran for more than 100 performances.

===1940–1957===
At the outbreak of the Second World War theatres were temporarily closed by government decree. When they were permitted to reopen, a few weeks later, &quot;Ladies in Retirement&quot; resumed its run until the theatre was hit by a bomb in 1940. It did not reopen until March 1941. A brief season of ballet was followed by a Shakespeare and Ben Jonson season by Donald Wolfit and his company. In mid-1942 Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; transferred from the Piccadilly Theatre; Coward took over the role of Charles Condomine from Cecil Parker prior to taking the play on tour. Wolfit and his company returned at the end of 1942 and played into the following year. Williams&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;A Month in the Country&quot; starring Michael Redgrave ran for 313 performances for most of 1943. It was followed by Agatha Christie&#x27;s &quot;Ten Little Niggers&quot;, which ran for 260 performances, interrupted when a bomb severely damaged the theatre in February 1944: the production moved temporarily to the Cambridge Theatre, returning in May to complete its run. Of productions of the later 1940s, few made much impression, with the exception of &quot;Adventure Story&quot; by Terence Rattigan (1949), starring Paul Scofield as Alexander the Great. The reviews were respectful, but the play ran for less than three months.
The critic Ivor Brown thought that Scofield&#x27;s performance as Alexander, though excellent, owed something to the example of Laurence Olivier. In January 1950 Olivier and his wife Vivien Leigh took over the management of the theatre. They opened with Christopher Fry&#x27;s new play, &quot;Venus Observed&quot;, in which Leigh did not appear. In 1951, for the Festival of Britain season, they starred in Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot; and Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Duncan observes, &quot;The company was as brilliant as it was enormous.&quot; In addition to the Oliviers it included Robert Helpmann, Richard Goolden, Wilfred Hyde White and Peter Cushing among the men, and their female colleagues included Elspeth March, Maxine Audley and Jill Bennett.

Later that year, at Olivier&#x27;s invitation, the French actors Jean-Louis Barrault and Madeleine Renaud presented a three-week season at the theatre with their own company. This was followed by Orson Welles in the title role of &quot;Othello&quot;, with Peter Finch as Iago and Gudrun Ure as Desdemona. In 1953 Olivier presented an Italian company headed by Ruggero Ruggeri in plays by Pirandello, and a short French season by the Comédie-Française.

In 1954 Rattigan&#x27;s play, &quot;Separate Tables&quot;, began a run of 726 performances, the longest in the history of the St James&#x27;s. The play starred Margaret Leighton and Eric Portman. During the run of &quot;Separate Tables&quot; it became known that a property developer had acquired the freehold of the theatre and had obtained the requisite permission from the London County Council (LCC) to demolish the building and replace it with an office block. Leigh and Olivier led a nationwide campaign to try to save the theatre. There were street marches and a protest in the House of Lords. A motion was carried against the Government in that house, but to no avail. The LCC ordered that no further theatres would be demolished in central London without a planned replacement, but neither the national nor the local government would intervene to prevent the destruction of the St James&#x27;s. After the run of &quot;Separate Tables&quot; there were five short-lived productions at the theatre, and the final performance there was given on 27 July 1957. In October the interior was stripped; in November the contents of the theatre were auctioned; and in December the demolition team moved in.

An office building, St James&#x27;s House, was built on the site. It incorporated sculptured balcony fronts on each floor above the entrance. Four bas-relief panels by Edward Bainbridge Copnall depicted the heads of Gilbert Miller, George Alexander, Oscar Wilde and the Oliviers. The office building was demolished and a new one built on the site in the 1980s. The panels were moved from the King Street façade to the Angel Court side of the building.

<text>Ntare II Rutaganzwa Rugamba (c. 1800 - c. 1850) was the king of Burundi. He was the son of king Mwambutsa I Mbariza and Msabiyije, a wife from the influential Bashoka Tutsi clan. The early years of his reign began with a regency, which was common in Burundian royal history.

Ntare&#x27;s inherited kingdom was approximately half the size of the present-day Burundi. Early in his rule, he came into conflict with Nsoro Nyabarega, the ruler of Bugesera. Eventually, around 1840, Ntare conquered the Buyogoma with the support of his son Rwasha. He achieved the greatest expansion in the history of Burundi, doubling the territory.

Ntare II was succeeded by Mwezi IV of Burundi, also known as Mwezi Gisabo.

== Life ==
His predecessor as king of Burundi was his father Mwezi III of Burundi.

In Mutaga&#x27;s life there had been conflicts with Ruanda. Fights that had begun with Burundis expansion northward ended when Mutaga married Rujugira, the daughter of Ruanda&#x27;s king.

These wars restarted in later years and he died in Butare. Mwambutsa I became his successor.

<text>Alexander Melentyevich Volkov ( ; 14 June 1891 – 3 July 1977) was a Soviet novelist, playwright, university lecturer. He was an author of novels, short stories, plays and poems for children, mostly remembered for the &quot;Magic Land&quot; series of books, based on L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;.

== Biography ==
Volkov was born in Ust-Kamenogorsk, Semipalatinsk Oblast, Russian Empire (now Oskemen, Kazakhstan). At the age of 12 he graduated from the Ust-Kamenogorsk town school as valedictorian, where he would later teach. In 1907 he entered the Tomsk Teachers Institute. In 1909 he graduated with right to teach all subjects of the school curriculum, except for the Law of God.

He began to work as a teacher in Ust-Kamenogorsk. Starting in 1910, he worked as a mathematics teacher in the village of Kolyvan. In the 1920s he moved to Yaroslavl, where he worked as a school principal. He graduated in absentia from the mathematical faculty of the Yaroslavl Pedagogical Institute.

In 1929 he moved to Moscow, where he worked as the head teacher of the rabfak. He completed coursework and passed the external examinations at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of Moscow University in seven months.

Starting in 1931 he worked as teacher, and later as Docent of the Department of Higher Mathematics of the Moscow Institute of Non-Ferrous Metals and Gold.

== Writings ==
=== Magic Land series ===
The first of these books, &quot;The Wizard of the Emerald City&quot; (), is a loose translation of the first Oz book, with chapters added, altered, or omitted, and some names changed (for example, Dorothy becomes &quot;Ellie&quot;, Oz is renamed &quot;Magic Land&quot;, and Toto can talk when in Magic Land), and several characters given personal names instead of generic ones. Baum&#x27;s name is mentioned in the first of Volkov&#x27;s books, but the publisher paid no royalties to the Baum estate. First published in 1939 in the Soviet Union, the book became quite popular; and in the 1960s Volkov also wrote his own sequels to the story. He liberally borrowed from some of the originals, such as using the &quot;Powder of Life&quot; idea from &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, but mostly created a divergent universe. From 1963 to 1970, four more books in the series were published, with the sixth and final story published posthumously in 1982. Other authors such as Yuri Kuznetsov, Sergei Sukhinov, and Leonid Vladimirsky (Volkov&#x27;s original illustrator) have recently written additional sequels in Russian, creating in effect an alternative series of Oz books.

The context and situations found in the Volkov version are notably different from the original Baum version in their political tones. The situations, while still maintaining a childlike clarity of good versus evil, often involve the characters encountering very mature political and ethical decisions. The heroes are repeatedly called upon to defend Magic Land against invasions or topple feudalistic or aristocratic governments to free the populace. Both themes are often found in Soviet sci-fi and adventure literature (see the Strugatsky brothers&#x27; novels &quot;Hard to be a God&quot; and &quot;Inhabited Island&quot;).

Volkov had faith in the omnipotence of the man-made technique, so the wizardry of his heroes was usually won with the help of various technical inventions (a cannon designed by Charly Black, a mechanical drill, and Tilly-Willy; a super-robot).

Volkov&#x27;s &quot;Magic Land&quot; series was translated into many languages and was popular with children all over the Eastern bloc. Volkov&#x27;s version of Oz seems to be better known than Baum&#x27;s in some countries, for example in China, in Germany (especially former East Germany), and also in Arab countries such as Syria. In Germany, two authors have written their own set of sequels to Volkov&#x27;s books.

The books in the series have been translated into English by Peter L. Blystone, and were published by Red Branch Press in three volumes (two books per volume) in 1991, 1993, and 2007. A revised edition of the first two-book volume was published in 2010.

<doc id="630604" wikidata="Q237740" url="?curid=630604" title="Wilhelmine, Margravine of Brandenburg-Bayreuth">
<text>Princess Friederike Sophie Wilhelmine of Prussia (3 July 170914 October 1758) was a Prussian princess and composer. She was the eldest daughter of Frederick William I of Prussia and Sophia Dorothea of Hanover, and a granddaughter of George I of Great Britain. She was the older sister of Frederick the Great. In 1731, she married Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. The baroque buildings and parks built during her tenure shape much of the present appearance of the town of Bayreuth, Germany.

== Early life ==

Born in Berlin, Wilhelmine shared the unhappy childhood of her brother, Frederick the Great, whose friend and confidante she remained all her life, with the exception of one short interval. She was fiercely beaten and abused by her governess during her childhood. Wilhelmine later wrote: &quot;Not a day passed that she [the governess] did not prove upon me the fearful power of her fists.&quot; The mistreatment continued until the prince&#x27;s governess finally said to their mother, who had been oblivious to the abuse, that she would not be surprised if Wilhelmine was eventually beaten until she was crippled. After this, the governess was promptly replaced.

Being the eldest daughter in her family, she was early the target of discussions about political marriages. Her mother, Queen Sophia Dorothea, wished her to marry her nephew Frederick, Prince of Wales, but on the British side there was no inclination to make an offer of marriage except in exchange for substantial concessions that Wilhelmine&#x27;s father would not accept. The fruitless intrigues carried on by Sophia Dorothea to bring about this match played a large part in Wilhelmine&#x27;s early life. Her father, on the other hand, preferred a match with the House of Habsburg.

==Marriage==
After much talk of other matches came to nothing, Wilhelmine was eventually married in 1731 to her Hohenzollern kinsman, Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Bayreuth. Frederick had been engaged to Wilhelmine&#x27;s younger sister, Sophie, but at the last moment King Frederick William I decided to replace her with Wilhelmine. The groom was not consulted in this decision.

This marriage was only accepted by Wilhelmine under threats from her father and with a view to lightening her brother&#x27;s disgrace. It was initially a happy marriage, but was eventually clouded first by limited financial resources and then by a love affair of the future Margrave with Dorothea von Marwitz, whose rise as an official mistress at the court of Bayreuth was bitterly resented by her brother Frederick the Great and caused an estrangement of some three years between him and Wilhelmine.

==Margravine==
When Wilhelmine&#x27;s spouse came into his inheritance in 1735, the pair set about making Bayreuth a miniature Versailles. Their building projects included the rebuilding of their summer residence (now part of the Hermitage Museum); the rebuilding of the great Bayreuth opera house; the building of a second, new opera house; the building of a theater; and the reconstruction of the Bayreuth palace. The so-called &quot;Bayreuth Rococo&quot; style of architecture is renowned even today. The pair also founded the University of Erlangen. All of these ambitious undertakings pushed the court to the verge of bankruptcy.

The margravine made Bayreuth one of the chief intellectual centers of the Holy Roman Empire, surrounding herself with a court of wits and artists that accrued added prestige from the occasional visits of Voltaire and Frederick the Great.

Wilhelmine&#x27;s brother Frederick granted her an allowance in exchange for troops, following the same procedure with her sisters. With the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War, Wilhelmine&#x27;s interests shifted from dilettantism to diplomacy. Austrian diplomats were trying to influence the court of Bayreuth to take their side against Prussia. In September 1745, during the Silesian war, Wilhelmine met with Maria Theresa of Austria. This almost destroyed her intimate relationship with her brother. In 1750 Wilhelmine visited the Prussian court for several weeks and met famous contemporaries such as Voltaire, Maupertuis and La Mettrie. In June 1754, the siblings met for the last time, after which Frederick swore her his eternal loyalty. She acted as eyes and ears for her brother in southern Germany until her death at Bayreuth on 14 October 1758, the day of Frederick&#x27;s defeat by the Austrian forces of Leopold Josef Graf Daun at the Battle of Hochkirch. Although Frederick had lost many friends and family to death throughout his life, Wilhelmine&#x27;s hit him the hardest. He suffered from severe illness for a week following news of Wilhelmine&#x27;s death and fell into a depression from which he never fully recovered.

On the tenth anniversary of her death, her devastated brother had the Temple of Friendship built at Sanssouci in her memory.

== Works ==
The margravine&#x27;s memoirs, &quot;Memoires de ma vie&quot;, written or revised in French between 1748 and her death, are preserved in the Royal Library of Berlin. They were first printed in two forms in 1810: a German translation down to the year 1733 from the firm of Cotta of Tübingen; and a version in French published by Vieweg of Brunswick, and coming down to 1742. There were several subsequent editions, including a German one published at Leipzig in 1908. An English translation was published in Berlin in 1904. For the discussion on the authenticity of these entertaining, though not very trustworthy, memoirs, see G. H. Pertz, &quot;Uber die Merkwürdigkeiten der Markgrafin&quot; (1851). See also Arvede Barine, &quot;Princesses et grandes dames&quot; (Paris, 1890); E. E. Cuttell, &quot;Wilhelmine, Margravine of Baireuth&quot; (London, 2 vols., 1905); &#x27; and R. Fester, &quot;Die Bayreuther Schwester Friedrichs des Grossen&quot; (Berlin, 1902). Writer William Thackeray recommended the memoirs to &quot;those who are curious about European Court history of the last age&quot;.

In addition to her other accomplishments, Wilhelmine was also a gifted composer and supporter of music. She was a lutenist, a student of Sylvius Leopold Weiss, and the employer of Bernhard Joachim Hagen.

Keyboard Concerto in G minor

# Allego, G minor.
# Cantabile, B flat major.
# Gavottes I &amp; II, G minor. Cembalo, Fl, Strings

The obbligato flute part could have been played either by her brother or her husband, as both were flautists (and pupils of Quantz). Each movement takes wing from solid and vigorous openings. There is a stubborn insistence about the first tutti&#x27;s repeated octave jumps, offset by the buoyancy of its striding sequences. She has a Bach-like flair for phrase extensions, which is also evident in the final gavotte where the solo shadows the orchestra and emerges to take the lead. Some of the ideas in the 34 bar slow movement are more son-of-Bach in style; and in the D minor second gavotte, which serves as a central &quot;trio&quot; to the first, there is a delicate episode of rather French, languishing descents.

Argenore: opera c. 1740. Seven soloists (3 sop., 1 mezzo-sop., 2 alto, 1 baritone or mezzo-sop.), and orchestra (1 flute, 2 oboes, 2 trumpets, strings, continuo). Performed in 1740 for her husband&#x27;s birthday.

Cavatinen: short songs; voice, strings, harpsichord.

Flute Sonata: flute &amp; keyboard, c. 1730.

Some chamber music still survives.

== Issue==

Wilhelmine&#x27;s only child was Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, born on August 30, 1732. Described by Casanova as the most beautiful princess in Germany, she was married to Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, in 1748. She died on 6 April 1780 without surviving children.

==Memoirs==
An earlier English translation from the French of her memoirs was published in a two volume edition in 1828 by Hunt and Clarke, York St., Covent Garden.

Scribner and Welford published Princess Helena of the United Kingdom&#x27;s German-to-English translation of Wilhelmine&#x27;s memoirs in 1887.

<text>The C-class Melbourne tram is a fleet of three-section Alstom Citadis 202 trams built in La Rochelle, France that operate on the Melbourne tram network. They were the first low-floor trams in Melbourne, being delivered in 2001-2002.

==History==
To meet a franchise commitment to introduce new trams to replace Z1 and Z2-class trams, 36 three-section Alstom Citadis 202 low-floor trams were purchased by Yarra Trams. They were the first low-floor trams in Melbourne, and the first tram imported for the Melbourne tram system since the 1920s.

The design was adapted by Alstom for local conditions, with the first four trams arriving at Webb Dock on 10 August 2001. Following fit-out and testing at Preston Workshops, they entered service on 12 October 2001. The last arrived on 25 June 2002 and entered service on 30 August 2002. All C1-class trams initially operated solely on route 109.

==Criticisms==
The Citadis trams have been criticised by the Australian Rail Tram &amp; Bus Industry Union (RTBU), who claim they have operational problems, including injuries to the drivers relating to design. There were concerns raised in 2011 regarding the rear-vision cameras fitted to the trams. Despite Yarra Trams replacing the cameras a number of times, there were visibility problems at night and in high glare situations. These had been solved by July 2012.

The trams have also been described by the RTBU as &quot;cheap as chips&quot;, following allegations that swaying and lateral forces at &quot;speeds above 25 km/h&quot; were causing driver injuries. Yarra Trams responded by stating that they were offering drivers lumbar support, and that track renewal had improved ride quality, reducing sway, while the driver&#x27;s controls had been changed to avoid wrist injuries.

Tram number 3011 has derailed three times, most recently on Sunday 6 October 2019. Each derailment occurred after a collision with a car. The RTBU has again said the model should be removed from service.

==Operation==
C-class trams operate on the following routes:
*48: North Balwyn to Victoria Harbour Docklands
*109: Box Hill to Port Melbourne

<text>In the field of genetics, a suicide gene is a gene that will cause a cell to kill itself through the process of apoptosis (programmed cell death). Activation of a suicide gene can cause death through a variety of pathways, but one important cellular &quot;switch&quot; to induce apoptosis is the p53 protein. Stimulation or introduction (through gene therapy) of suicide genes is a potential way of treating cancer or other proliferative diseases.

Suicide genes form the basis of a strategy for making cancer cells more vulnerable or sensitive to chemotherapy. The approach has been to attach parts of genes expressed in cancer cells to other genes for enzymes not found in mammals that can convert a harmless substance into one that is toxic to the tumor. Most suicide genes mediate this sensitivity by coding for viral or bacterial enzymes that convert an inactive drug into toxic antimetabolites that inhibit the synthesis of nucleic acid. Suicide genes must be introduced into the cells in ways that ensure their uptake and expression by as many cancer cells as possible, while limiting their expression by normal cells. Suicide gene therapy for cancer requires the vector to have the capacity to discriminate between target and non target cells, between the cancer cells and normal cells.

== Apoptosis ==
Cell death can majorly occur by either necrosis or apoptosis. Necrosis occurs when a cell is damaged by an external force, such as poison, a bodily injury, an infection or getting cut off from blood supply. When cells die from necrosis, it&#x27;s a rather messy affair. The death causes inflammation that can cause further distress of injury within the body. Whereas, apoptosis causes degradation of cellular components without eliciting an inflammatory response.

Many cells undergo programmed cell death, or apoptosis, during fetal development. A form of cell death in which a programmed sequence of events leads to the elimination of cells without releasing harmful substances into the surrounding. Apoptosis plays a crucial role in developing and maintaining the health of the body by eliminating old cells, unnecessary cells, and unhealthy cells. The human body replaces perhaps one million cells per second. When a cell is compelled to commit suicide, proteins called caspases go into action. They break down the cellular components needed for survival, and they spur production of enzymes known as DNase, which destroy the DNA in the nucleus of the cell. The cell shrinks and sends out distress signals, which are answered by macrophages. The macrophages clean away the shrunken cells, leaving no trace, so these cells do not damage surrounding necrotic cells do. Apoptosis is also essential to prenatal development. For example, in embryos, fingers and toes are initially connected to adjacent digits by tissue. The cells of this connecting tissue undergo apoptosis to produce separate digits. In brain development, initially millions of extra neurons are created. The cells that don&#x27;t form synaptic connections undergo apoptosis. Programmed cell death is also necessary to start the process of menstruation. That&#x27;s not to say that apoptosis is a perfect process. Rather than dying due to injury, cells that go through apoptosis die in response to signals within the body. When cells recognize viruses and gene mutations, they may induce death to prevent the damage from spreading. Scientist are trying to learn how they can modulate apoptosis, so that they can control which cells live and which undergo programmed cell death. Anti-cancer drugs and radiation, for example, work by triggering apoptosis in diseased cells. Many diseases and disorders are linked with the life and death of cells—increased apoptosis is a characteristic of AIDS, Alzheimer&#x27;s, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease, while decreased apoptosis can signal lupus or cancer. Understanding how to regulate apoptosis could be the first step to treating these conditions.

Too little or too much apoptosis can play a role in many diseases. When apoptosis does not work correctly, cells that should be eliminated may persist and become immortal, for example, in cancer and leukemia. when apoptosis works overly well, it kills too many cells and inflicts grave tissue damage. This is the case in strokes and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Also known as programmed cell death and cell suicide.

== Applications ==

=== Cancer suicide gene therapy ===

The ultimate goal of cancer therapy is the complete elimination of all cancer cells, while leaving all healthy cells unharmed. One of the most promising therapeutic strategies in this regard is cancer suicide gene therapy (CSGT), which is rapidly progressing into new frontiers. The therapeutic success, in CSGT, is primarily contingent upon precision in delivery of the therapeutic transgenes to the cancer cells only. This is addressed by discovering and targeting unique or / and over-expressed biomarkers displayed on the cancer cells and cancer stem cells. Specificity of cancer therapeutic effects is further enhanced by designing the DNA constructs, which put the therapeutic genes under the control of the cancer cell specific promoters. The delivery of the suicidal genes to the cancer cells involves viral, as well as synthetic vectors, which are guided by cancer specific antibodies and ligands. The delivery options also include engineered stem cells with tropisms towards cancers. Main mechanisms inducing cancer cells&#x27; deaths include: transgenic expression of thymidine kinases, cytosine deaminases, intracellular antibodies, telomeraseses, caspases, DNases. Precautions are undertaken to eliminate the risks associated with transgenesis. Progress in genomics and proteomics should help us in identifying the cancer specific biomarkers and metabolic pathways for developing new strategies towards clinical trials of targeted and personalized gene therapy of cancer. By introducing the gene into a malignant tumor, the tumor would reduce in size and possibly disappear completely, provided all the individual cells have received a copy of the gene.

When the DNA sample in the virus is taken from the patient&#x27;s own healthy cells, the virus does not need to be able to differentiate between cancer cells and healthy ones. In addition, the advantage is that it is also able to prevent metastasis upon the death of a tumor.

=== As a cancer treatment ===

One of the challenges of cancer treatment is how to destroy malignant tumors without damaging healthy cells. A new method that shows great promise for accomplishing this employs the use of a suicide gene. A suicide gene is a gene which will cause a cell to kill itself through apoptosis. Suicide gene therapy involves delivery of a gene which codes for a cytotoxic product into tumor cells. This can be achieved by two approaches, indirect gene therapy and direct gene therapy. Indirect gene therapy employs enzyme-activated prodrug, in which the enzyme converts the prodrug to a toxic substance and the gene coding for this enzyme is delivered to the tumor cells. For example, a commonly studied strategy based on transfection of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) along with administration of ganciclovir (GSV), in which HSK-TK assists in converting GCV to a toxic compound that inhibits DNA synthesis and causes cell death. Whereas, direct gene therapy employs a toxin gene or a gene which has the ability to correct mutated proapoptotic genes, which can in turn induce cell death via apoptosis.  For instance, the most researched immunotoxin for cancer therapy is the diphtheria toxin as it inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating elongation factor 2 (EF-2) which in turn inhibits protein translation, Moreover, p53 is identified to be frequently abnormal in human tumors and studies show that restoring function of p53 can cause apoptosis of cancer cells. Suicide gene therapy is not necessarily expected to eliminate the need for chemotherapy and radiation treatment for all cancerous tumors. The damage inflicted upon the tumor cells, however, makes them more susceptible to the chemo or radiation. This approach has already proven effective against prostate and bladder cancers. The application of suicide gene therapy is being expanded to several other forms of cancer as well. Cancer patients often experience depressed immune systems, so they can suffer some side effects of the use of a virus as a delivery agent.

==== Improved vectors ====
Suicide gene delivery can be broadly classified into three groups which include viral vectors, synthetic vectors and cell-based vectors. The most efficient vehicles for gene delivery are viral vectors. Widely used viruses for gene therapy include retrovirus, adenovirus (Ads), lentivirus and Aden-associated viruses (AAVs). Non-viral vectors like synthetic vectors were used to combat certain disadvantages of viral vectors like immunogenicity, insertional mutagenesis to name a few. Synthetic vectors refer to use of nanoparticles, like gold nanoparticles, to delivery genes to target cells. Lastly, cell-based vectors employ stem cells as carriers of suicide genes. In the last few years, cell-mediated gene therapy for cancer using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was patented.

==== Bystander effect ====
The bystander effect (BE) is phenomenon as a result of which it is possible to kill untransfected tumor cells located adjacent to transduced cells in suicide gene therapy. As hundred percent transduction of all tumor cells is very difficult to achieve, BE is critical feature of suicide gene therapy.

==== Limitations ====
The drug is supposed to show high specificity towards cancer in order to effective, but studies have shown this to be rarely achieved. Moreover, expression of suicide gene was under control of tumor-specific promoters like human telomerase (hTERT), osteocalcin, carcinoembryonic antigen; however, only hTERT promoter was found to enter clinic trials. This is majorly because of the low transcriptional power of these tumor-specific promoters for suicide gene expression. Additionally, poor accessibility to target cells is an important limitation of suicide gene therapy. Another major hurdle of suicide gene therapy is partial vector specificity to target affected cells. Finally, lack of specific animal models to predict the clinical outcome and other effects of SGT.

=== Biotechnology ===

Suicide genes are often utilized in biotechnology to assist in molecular cloning. Vectors incorporate suicide genes for an organism (such as E. coli). The cloning project focuses on replacing the suicide gene by the desired fragment. Selection of vectors carrying the desired fragment is improved since vectors retaining the suicide gene result in cell death.

<text>The Alstom Citadis is a family of low-floor trams and light rail vehicles built by Alstom. , over 2,300 Citadis trams have been sold and 1,800 tramways are in revenue service throughout the world, with operations in all six inhabited continents. An evolution of Alstom&#x27;s earlier TFS vehicle, most Citadis vehicles are made in Alstom&#x27;s factories in La Rochelle, Reichshoffen and Valenciennes, France, and in Barcelona, Spain, and Annaba, Algeria.

==Citadis types==
The Citadis family includes both partial and fully low-floor trams and LRVs, in versions with three (20x), five (30x), seven (40x), and nine (50x) sections. It comprises the following standard variants:

===Urban tramway vehicles===

Citadis X00:
*Citadis 100 – three section, 70% low floor, originally designed and manufactured by Konstal in Chorzów for the Polish market (Katowice, Gdańsk)
Citadis X01 (First generation):
*Citadis 301 – three section, 70% low floor (Orléans)
**Citadis 301 CIS – 100% low floor version with IPOMOS bogies on gauge (Moscow, Saint-Petersburg). Also designated 71-801 according to the Russian unified system of rolling stock classification (71=trams, 8=manufacturer code (Alstom), 01=model code).
*Citadis 401 – five sections, 70% low floor (Montpellier and Dublin, some converted from 301s)
Citadis X02 (Second generation):
*Citadis 202 – three section, 100% low floor (Melbourne)
*Citadis 302 – five sections, 100% low floor (Algiers, Adelaide, Angers, Lyon, Bordeaux, Paris T2, T7 and T8, Valenciennes, Rotterdam, Buenos Aires, Madrid, Melbourne, Nice, Murcia, Barcelona, Jerusalem, Le Havre and Nottingham)
*Citadis 402 – seven sections, 100% low floor (Bordeaux, Grenoble, Lyon, Paris T3, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Oran, Constantine)
*Citadis 502 – nine sections, 100% low floor (Dublin, some converted from 402s)
Citadis X03 (Third generation):
*Citadis 403 – seven sections, 100% low floor (Strasbourg)
Citadis X04 (Fourth generation):
*Citadis 304 – 100% low floor, next generation design for Central and Eastern Europe (Istanbul)
Citadis X05 (Fifth generation):
*Citadis 205 or Compact – three sections, 100% low floor (Aubagne, Avignon)
*Citadis 305 – five sections, 100% low floor (Sydney, Lusail, Caen, Kaohsiung, Athens, Philadelphia)
*Citadis 405 – seven sections, 100% low floor (Nice, Paris line T9, T10)

===Light-rail transit vehicles===
*Regio-Citadis – three sections, 70% low floor LRV (Kassel, The Hague)
*Citadis Dualis – four or five sections, 100% low-floor LRV (operated by the SNCF, &quot;see below&quot;)
* Citadis Spirit – three or four sections, 100% low floor LRV designed for the North American market (Ottawa, Toronto)

===Power supply===
Like most trams, Citadis vehicles are usually powered by overhead electric wires collected by a pantograph, but the trams in several places do not use pantograph current collection entirely. Other places, such as Toronto, use a trolley pole.

The most popular solution is Alstom&#x27;s proprietary ground-level power supply (APS, first used in Bordeaux and subsequently in Angers, Reims, Orleans, Tours, Dubai, Rio, and Sydney), consisting of a type of third rail which is only powered while it is completely covered by a tram so that there is no risk of a person or animal coming into contact with a live rail. On the networks in France and in Sydney, the trams switch to conventional overhead wires in outer areas, but the Dubai vehicles are the first to employ APS for its entire passenger length (although they are still equipped with pantographs for use in the maintenance depot).

Another option is to use on-board batteries to store electrical power, allowing brief periods of catenary-free operation without the need to install special infrastructure. The Citadis trams in Nice operate off a set of nickel metallic hydride batteries in two large open spaces where overhead wires would be an eyesore. This has since been superseded by a supercapacitor-based energy storage system (SRS) which is in use in Rio de Janeiro (alongside APS), Kaohsiung, and along a new line in Nice. The Regio-Citadis can also be built as a dual-voltage or electro-diesel vehicle with various configurations.

<text>Greater Vitória (&quot;Região Metropolitana da Grande Vitória&quot;) is a metropolitan area in Espírito Santo, Brazil. It is made up of the following municipalities: Cariacica, Fundão, Guarapari, Serra, Vitória, Vila Velha, and Viana and according to IBGE it covers an area of 2,331.01 km2 with 1,880,828 inhabitants (2022). It was established on February 21, 1995, when it was known as the Metropolitan Region of Vitória (RMV, &quot;Região Metropolitana de Vitória&quot;), and later modified in 1999 and 2001, when it was renamed and it incorporated the municipalities of Guarapari and Fundão respectively. These seven municipalities are home to almost half of the total population of Espírito Santo (49%) and 57% of the state&#x27;s urban population. They produce 58% of the wealth and consume 95% of the electricity.

The term &quot;Greater Vitória&quot; corresponds mainly to the area centered on Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, Brazil. Today, the greatest part of industrial development is occurring in the Serra municipality, where many industries are building depots and factories. Those take advantage of the 3 Ports, Vitória Airport and the proximity to the ring road, which goes right though Serra, to distribute their products.

<doc id="630617" wikidata="Q626220" url="?curid=630617" title="Paraguayan National Anthem">
<text>The &quot;Paraguayan National Anthem&quot; () was officially adopted on 20 May 1846. The lyrics were written by Francisco Acuña de Figueroa under the presidency of Carlos Antonio López, who at the time delegated Bernardo Jovellanos and Anastasio González to ask Figueroa to write the anthem. The original composer of the song remains unclear, although the music is often attributed to Francesco Casale. Remberto Giménez rearranged the melody in 1933.

The author of the lyrics also wrote the lyrics to the &quot;Uruguayan National Anthem&quot;.

==History==
It still remains unclear who was responsible for the creation of the music. Some sources claim that Frenchman Francisco Sauvageot de Dupuis was the composer, while others claim it to be the work of the Hungarian-born Francisco José Debali (Debály Ferenc József), who composed the music for the Uruguayan national anthem. What it is known for sure is that it was the Paraguayan composer Remberto Giménez who in 1933 arranged and developed the version of the national anthem that remains in use by Paraguay today.

== Lyrics ==
Though the national anthem has many verses, usually only the first verse followed by the chorus are sung on most occasions. Due to the song&#x27;s length, the wordless introductory section and the latter half of the first verse are often omitted for brevity when the national anthem is played before a sporting event such as a soccer game.
