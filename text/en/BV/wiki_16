<text>The Joe Perry Project is an American rock band formed by Aerosmith lead guitarist Joe Perry shortly before his departure from Aerosmith in 1979. They almost immediately signed a record deal with Aerosmith&#x27;s label, Columbia Records, who were disappointed with the chaos in the Aerosmith camp and hoping to maneuver Perry back into Aerosmith. The Project, with its debut album, &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot;, played in smaller venues mostly around the Boston area. After several line-up changes over the next few years and two more albums with dismal sales the band dissolved in 1984 when Perry, and guitarist Brad Whitford, agreed to reunite with Aerosmith, bringing the band back to its original line-up. Joe Perry has reformed the Joe Perry Project several times since as a side project to stay busy during downtime with Aerosmith.

==History==
The original band line-up consisted of Joe Perry on guitar and sometimes lead vocal, Ralph Morman, on lead vocals, bassist David Hull, and drummer Ronnie Stewart. This line-up recorded the band&#x27;s 1980 debut album, &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot;, which was produced by long-time Aerosmith producer Jack Douglas. The album was well-received and sold 250,000 copies in America within its first six months of release.

In June 1980, while on tour in support of the album, Ralph Morman was fired from the band due to issues with alcohol and his undependable and unpredictable behavior. He was temporarily replaced by singer Joey Mala, of the New York-based act Revolver, in order for Perry to fulfill concert obligations until a permanent vocalist could be brought in. A permanent replacement was eventually found in singer and rhythm guitarist Charlie Farren. Perry, Farren, Stewart, and Hull recorded one album, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got the Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Rolls Again&quot;, which proved to be less successful than the group&#x27;s debut effort. Columbia Records executives were reluctant to promote the album, which some believe was due solely on the fact that they were much more interested in a reunited Aerosmith, than a Perry solo project. This resistance from the label, combined with Perry&#x27;s ongoing drug and financial problems, led to the entire band quitting in 1982.

Equipped with a new record label (MCA Records) and three new band members in singer Cowboy Mach Bell, bassist Danny Hargrove and drummer Joe Pet, the band released &quot;Once a Rocker, Always a Rocker&quot; in 1983. The album met the same fate as its predecessor, selling less than 50,000 copies. Despite the poor sales, The Project went out on a final tour in support of the album, adding then-former Aerosmith guitarist Brad Whitford to the line-up.

A compilation album, &quot;The Music Still Does the Talking: The Best of the Joe Perry Project&quot;, was released by an Australian Indie Record label in 1999.

==Reformation==
On October 6, 2009, Joe Perry, on his own record label (&quot;Roman Records)&quot; released a solo album titled &quot;Have Guitar, Will Travel&quot;. The first single was called &quot;We&#x27;ve Got a Long Way to Go.&quot; Although the record was released as a Perry solo album, the touring band included original bassist David Hull and was billed as The Joe Perry Project. Also participating were guitarist/keyboardist Paul Santo (Aerosmith, Ozzy Osbourne, Ringo Starr), drummer Marty Richards ( James Montgomery, Norah Jones, The J. Geils Band) and German vocalist Hagen Grohe who was discovered by Billie Perry (Joe Perry&#x27;s wife) on YouTube. The new Joe Perry Project also backed Joe on his latest album, making it a de facto JPP album.

On September 20, 2009, the new Joe Perry Project played the first public concert of the Have Guitar, Will Travel Tour at Memorial Hall in Plymouth, Massachusetts. The show was announced just days before the event. Fans who attended were the first to hear some of the new songs from the upcoming album, as well as a handful of classic Aerosmith songs including: &quot;Let the Music Do the Talking&quot; (original JPP version), &quot;Walkin&#x27; The Dog,&quot; &quot;Dream On,&quot; &quot;Combination&quot; and &quot;Walk This Way.&quot; The final song of the night was a cover of Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; in the Free World.&quot;

During the 2009–2010 tour, the Joe Perry Project opened for Bad Company and Mötley Crüe.

In 2022, Joe Perry announced that the Joe Perry Project would be playing three shows in New England that summer. The lineup for these shows includes Buck Johnson, Pet, Chris Wyse, and Gary Cherone of Extreme. Additionally the band scheduled two shows in Brazil that same summer. The next year, Perry announced another tour. The lineup for the 2023 tour includes Cherone, Johnson, Hull, and Jason Sutter, who toured with the band the prior year in place of Pet.

<doc id="613635" wikidata="Q5349014" url="?curid=613635" title="Eight Skilled Gentlemen">
<text>Eight Skilled Gentlemen is a novel by Barry Hughart, first published in 1990.
It is the third, and final, part of a series set in a version of ancient China that began with &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; and &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In this novel, Li Kao and Number Ten Ox are attending the execution of a notorious criminal (about whose capture the less said the better, according to the chronicler) when into the public square bounds a &quot;vampire ghoul&quot; who soon meets a fiery demise. Master Li is given the case by the &quot;Celestial Master&quot; who soon becomes a main suspect. The plot involves everything from a conspiracy involving fake tea to dog-brides, puppeteers to magic birdcages, assorted pre-Chinese demons and gods, and the hooded and ancient Eight Skilled Gentlemen.

The plot also involves a subject rarely mentioned in fiction, the pre-Chinese aborigines and their gods.

==Reviews==
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; called this book &quot;a refreshing change from the dull and endless parade of Celtic myth that dominates the fantasy marketplace.&quot; They compare his writing to Ernest Bramah&#x27;s Kai Lung novels and Robert van Gulik&#x27;s Judge Dee mysteries.

&quot;School Library Journal&quot; states &quot;This is a mystery story for those who don&#x27;t read mysteries, a fantasy novel for people who don&#x27;t read fantasy, and a good time for anyone.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book as &quot;Superbly written and narrated in the humorously observant voice of Number Ten Ox, this is a book not to be missed.&quot;

<doc id="613638" wikidata="Q2235969" url="?curid=613638" title="Sutton Cheney">
<text>Sutton Cheney ( ) is a village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Dadlington and Sutton Cheney, in the borough of Hinckley and Bosworth, in the county of Leicestershire, England, near the county border with Warwickshire. In addition to the village of Sutton Cheney itself, the civil parish also contains the villages of Dadlington and Shenton, a number of farms, and the location of the Battle of Bosworth. Its closest large towns are Nuneaton and Hinckley. Its closest market town is Market Bosworth.

The village of Sutton Cheney is clustered around the intersection of four roads: Ambion Lane leading westwards to the village of Shenton; Bosworth Road leading northwest to the neighbouring town of Market Bosworth; Main Street leading northeast to the villages of Cadeby or Stapleton; and Wharf Lane leading southwest to Sutton Cheney Wharf on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal. 

The civil parish of Dadlington and Sutton Cheney is bordered by the civil parishes of Market Bosworth to the north; Cadeby to the northeast; Peckleton to the east; Barwell, Stoke Golding, and Higham on the Hill to the south; and Sheepy to the west. Its population at the 2021 census was 490, down from 538 in 2011 and from 545 in 2001.

== History ==
The area was settled in both Bronze Age and Roman times but the earliest written mention of the village of Sutton Cheney is in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was named Sutone. It was mostly owned by Crowland Abbey with a minor holding in the hands of Hugh de Grandmesnil, a companion of William the Conqueror. At that time it was recorded as having four households.

The manor took the name &#x27;Sutton Chainell&#x27; during the thirteenth century on account of a rich farmer named Chainell who held the village as a tenant of Crowland Abbey but the name appears variously as Sutton, Sutton juxta Bosworth, Sutton Chenyie, and Sutton Cheynell in deeds and other official registers between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries.

The army of Richard III made camp in the village on 21 August 1485, the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field, and the battle itself took place within the civil parish, near to Dadlington. Richard died in the battle, which was the last battle of the Wars of the Roses. It ended the Middle Ages in England and ushered in the Tudor period.

In 1564 there were 25 families living in Sutton Cheynell and in 1630 the freeholders were Sir William Roberts, Richard May, William Drakeley and John Swinfen. Sir William Roberts endowed six Almshouses for the village in 1612 and his tomb is still extant in the village church, with the inscriptions: &#x27;Sir William Roberts was son of Thomas Roberts and married to his first wife Katherine, daughter of Richard Elkington, and to his second wife Elizabeth, daughter of Valentine Hartopp; but by neither had issue. He lived 79 years and died Feb 24 1633&#x27; and &#x27;Here lyeth interred the body of Sir William Roberts, who in his life-time, being devoted both to hospitality and charity, among other memorable works erected, out of a pious mind, a hospital for six poor men adjoining the churchyard and endowed it with 30 pounds worth of land yearly for their maintenance for ever.&#x27;

Between the seventeenth and twentieth centuries, the village of Sutton Cheney was an estate village, developed to suit the needs of a single farming family, with the Hall as their home. In addition to workers&#x27; cottages, a further range of buildings such as a blacksmith&#x27;s, bakery, and post office provided the essentials of rural life, together with Almshouses for poor single men. These have now all been converted to dwellings but the village retains its traditional character and is designated as a conservation area. Today, the majority of the land and approximately half the dwellings are still in the ownership of the estate, with half the dwellings in private ownership.

Sutton Cheney was formerly a chapelry in the parish of Market-Bosworth, from 1866 Sutton Cheney was a civil parish in its own right, on 1 April 1935 the parishes of Dadlington and Shenton were merged with Sutton Cheney, the merged parish was named &quot;Sutton Cheney&quot; until 2023 when it was renamed &quot;Dadlington and Sutton Cheney&quot;. In 1931 the parish of Sutton Cheney (prior to the merge) had a population of 207.

== Battlefield Heritage Centre ==
Within the civil parish, on Ambion Hill, is the Bosworth Battlefield Heritage Centre and Country Park, maintained by Leicestershire County Council as a country park and learning centre to advance public knowledge about the Battle of Bosworth Field. The battlefield entrance is opposite Ambion Firewood &amp; Contractors

The centre also contains the Tithe Barn restaurant and cafe, based in a reconstructed fourteenth century oak timbered barn, donated by the Derbyshire County Council.

Other monuments within the centre include King Richard&#x27;s Well, where Richard III is reputed to have drunk before the battle and a cairn now stands as his monument, and a memorial sundial.

== Other attractions and amenities ==

Sutton Cheney Wharf is situated within the civil parish on the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal and maintained by the Canal &amp; River Trust. It gives access through Ambion Wood to the Battlefield Centre and there is also a cafe called Sutton Wharf on the site.

A heritage steam railway, the Battlefield Line Railway, runs from Shenton station, within the civil parish, to Shackerstone. It is operated by the Shackerstone Railway Society. 

In the village of Shenton the old village hall is now an art gallery and cafe, the White Dove Gallery, and a group of restored and listed farm buildings now operate as Whitemoors Antique Centre and Tearooms.

The Leicestershire Round, a 200 mile walk around the county of Leicestershire runs through the civil parish and the village itself, linking it by footpath to the adjacent town and civil parish of Market Bosworth in a walk through farmland and Market Bosworth Country Park.

== Notable buildings in the village ==

The village of Sutton Cheney has two Georgian coaching inns. The Hercules Revived (formerly The Hercules Inn), is named after the prizewinning horse Hercules owned by the Dixie family of Market Bosworth in the eighteenth century. It was renovated and restored in 2012. The Royal Arms (formerly The Greyhound Inn) was re-opened in 2003 as a hotel, restaurant, and wedding venue.
St James&#x27; Church dates originally from the early 13th century with repairs and restorations in the centuries since, including the west tower built in brick in the nineteenth century. Richard III reputedly heard his last Mass in the church the night before the Battle of Bosworth Field. The church is consequently known as &quot;the Battlefield Church&quot; and contains a plaque in remembrance of him. Many of the kneelers in the church were embroidered by members of the Richard III Society and on 22 March 2015, the funeral cortège of the King paused in Sutton Cheney en route to his burial in Leicester Cathedral.

The six Almshouses founded by Sir William Roberts in 1612 and altered in 1811, as a plaque records, due to &quot;the liberality of Rosamund Kinnersley&quot; are now a private home, having been converted in the late twentieth century.

The Hall dates from 1601 with later additions and a Victorian wing.

Townshend Farmhouse dates from the early 19th century with an earlier core.

The village has been designated as a conservation area.

== Notable residents and visitors ==

As well as Richard III, the parish also contained the campsite of Henry VII, the victor of the Battle of Bosworth, who was crowned King of England in the adjacent civil parish of Stoke Golding.

The famous mathematician Thomas Simpson FRS (1710-1761) of Market Bosworth, Nuneaton, and Woolwich is buried in the graveyard of St James&#x27; Church. There is a Latin memorial plaque to him inside the Church to the left of the door.

The village&#x27;s vicar from 1960 until his death in 1986, the Rev. E. R. &quot;Teddy&quot; Boston, was notable as a traction engine and light railway enthusiast and engineer who constructed the now-dismantled Cadeby Light Railway. He was immortalised in his friend Rev. Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s The Railway Series books (more commonly known as the Thomas the Tank Engine books) as &quot;the Fat Clergyman&quot;. There is a plaque to him in the chancel of St James&#x27; Church.

<text>The Beretta 3032 Tomcat and Beretta 3032 Tomcat Inox are semi-automatic pocket pistols designed and manufactured by Beretta. They are chambered in .32 ACP (a.k.a. 7.65 mm Browning) and are small pistols, designed for concealed-carry and use as backup weapons. The Beretta 3032 Tomcat builds on a long line of small and compact pocket pistols for self defense manufactured by Beretta. The allure and popularity is commonly attributed to the loading procedure, which does not require the user to &quot;rack&quot; the slide to chamber a round, but rather place a round in the tip-up barrel before the magazine is inserted. This is especially popular for those with weaker or smaller hands.

==Specifications==
The Beretta 3032 Tomcat is a simple blowback pistol with a single- and double-action trigger mechanism. It also features a tip-up barrel. It is fitted with a frame-mounted thumb safety. This safety acts as a slide stop when engaged. The frame is made of aluminium alloy while the slide and barrel are carbon steel in the standard version and stainless steel in the &quot;Inox&quot; variant.

A document included with all Model 3032 Tomcat pistols warns that the owner should never use ammunition that exceeds of muzzle energy. Notably, even normal factory .32 ACP cartridges have become significantly more powerful in recent decades and can well exceed the 130 ft-lb limit of the pistol&#x27;s initial design, one that Beretta continues to use to this day. Representatives of Beretta USA have often recommended that owners purchase their .32 ACP ammunition online, so that the muzzle energy is properly verified in specification charts. Use of any ammunition that exceeds this rating may cause irreparable or prohibitively expensive damage to the firearm, most commonly manifesting as a crack on the frame.

Notably, the design omits an extractor mechanism; thus, the firearm relies solely on the blowback energy of the cartridge to extract and eject spent casings.

Beretta recommends caution when removing grip panels, as the safety mechanism is retained underneath with spring tension. Parts can be lost during improper removal, making the firearm inoperable until repaired. The barrel should not be completely removed from the assembly, which may cause frame damage.

==Variants==
The model 3032 Tomcat is available in an &quot;Inox&quot; variant, with stainless steel barrel and slide and the frame anodized for a similar aesthetic. For a short time, a titanium-framed model was also available. Previously, Beretta offered a variant of the Tomcat possessing tritium night sights referred to as the &quot;Alley Cat,&quot; which was discontinued in the late 2000s. In 2020, Beretta began offering a &quot;Covert&quot; model with wooden grip panels and a factory threaded barrel (2.9 in).

<doc id="613640" wikidata="Q2622199" url="?curid=613640" title="Upper respiratory tract infection">
<text>An upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) is an illness caused by an acute infection, which involves the upper respiratory tract, including the nose, sinuses, pharynx, larynx or trachea. This commonly includes nasal obstruction, sore throat, tonsillitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, sinusitis, otitis media, and the common cold. Most infections are viral in nature, and in other instances, the cause is bacterial. URTIs can also be fungal or helminthic in origin, but these are less common.
In 2015, 17.2 billion cases of URTIs are estimated to have occurred. As of 2016, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990.
==Signs and symptoms==

In uncomplicated colds, coughing and nasal discharge may persist for 14 days or more even after other symptoms have resolved.
Acute URTIs include rhinitis, pharyngitis/tonsillitis, and laryngitis often referred to as a common cold, and their complications: sinusitis, ear infection, and sometimes bronchitis (though bronchi are generally classified as part of the lower respiratory tract.) Symptoms of URTIs commonly include cough, sore throat, runny nose, nasal congestion, headache, low-grade fever, facial pressure, and sneezing.

Symptoms of rhinovirus in children usually begin 1–3 days after exposure. The illness usually lasts 7–10 more days.

Color or consistency changes in mucous discharge to yellow, thick, or green are the natural course of viral URTI and not an indication for antibiotics.

Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal pharyngitis/tonsillitis (strep throat) typically presents with a sudden onset of sore throat, pain with swallowing, and fever. Strep throat does not usually cause a runny nose, voice changes, or cough.

Pain and pressure of the ear caused by a middle-ear infection (otitis media) and the reddening of the eye caused by viral conjunctivitis are often associated with URTIs.

==Cause==
In terms of pathophysiology, rhinovirus infection resembles the immune response. The viruses do not cause damage to the cells of the upper respiratory tract, but rather cause changes in the tight junctions of epithelial cells. This allows the virus to gain access to tissues under the epithelial cells and initiate the innate and adaptive immune responses.

Up to 15% of acute pharyngitis cases may be caused by bacteria, most commonly &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot;, a group A streptococcus in streptococcal pharyngitis (&quot;strep throat&quot;). Other bacterial causes are &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, &quot;Corynebacterium diphtheriae&quot;, &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot;, and &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;.

Sexually transmitted infections have emerged as causes of oral and pharyngeal infections.

==Diagnosis==
===Classification===
A URTI may be classified by the area inflamed.
Rhinitis affects the nasal mucosa, while rhinosinusitis or sinusitis affects the nose and paranasal sinuses, including frontal, ethmoid, maxillary, and sphenoid sinuses. Nasopharyngitis (rhinopharyngitis or the common cold) affects the nares, pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils generally. Without involving the nose, pharyngitis inflames the pharynx, hypopharynx, uvula, and tonsils. Similarly, epiglottitis (supraglottitis) inflames the superior portion of the larynx and supraglottic area; laryngitis is in the larynx; laryngotracheitis is in the larynx, trachea, and subglottic area; and tracheitis is in the trachea and subglottic area.

==Prevention==
Vaccination against influenza viruses, adenoviruses, measles, rubella, &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;, &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;, diphtheria, &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, and &quot;Bordetella pertussis&quot; may prevent them from infecting the URT or reduce the severity of the infection.

==Treatment==

Treatment comprises symptomatic support usually via analgesics for headache, sore throat, and muscle aches. Moderate exercise in sedentary subjects with a naturally acquired URTI probably does not alter the overall severity and duration of the illness. No randomized trials have been conducted to ascertain benefits of increasing fluid intake.

===Antibiotics===
Prescribing antibiotics for laryngitis is not a suggested practice. The antibiotics penicillin V and erythromycin are not effective for treating acute laryngitis. Erythromycin may improve voice disturbances after a week and cough after 2 weeks, but any modest subjective benefit is not greater than the adverse effects, cost, and the risk of bacteria developing resistance to the antibiotics. Health authorities have been strongly encouraging physicians to decrease the prescribing of antibiotics to treat common URTIs because antibiotic usage does not significantly reduce recovery time for these viral illnesses. A 2017 systematic review found three interventions which were probably effective in reducing antibiotic use for acute respiratory infections: C-reactive protein testing, procalcitonin-guided management, and shared decision-making between physicians and patients. The use of narrow-spectrum antibiotics has been shown to be just as effective as broad-spectrum alternatives for children with acute bacterial URTIs, and has a lower risk of side effects in children. Decreased antibiotic usage may also help prevent drug-resistant bacteria. Some have advocated a delayed antibiotic approach to treating URTIs, which seeks to reduce the consumption of antibiotics while attempting to maintain patient satisfaction. A Cochrane review of 11 studies and 3,555 participants explored antibiotics for respiratory tract infections. It compared delaying antibiotic treatment to either starting them immediately or to no antibiotics. Outcomes were mixed depending on the respiratory tract infection; symptoms of acute otitis media and sore throat were modestly improved with immediate antibiotics with minimal difference in complication rate. Antibiotic usage was reduced when antibiotics were only used for ongoing symptoms and maintained patient satisfaction at 86%. In a trial involving 432 children with a URTI, amoxicillin was no more effective than placebo, even for children with more severe symptoms such as fever or shortness of breath.

For sinusitis while at the same time discouraging overuse of antibiotics the CDC recommends:
* Target likely organisms with first-line medications: amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate
* Use the shortest effective course; should see improvement in 2–3 days. Continue treatment for 7 days after symptoms improve or resolve (usually a 10–14 day course).
* Consider imaging studies in recurrent or unclear cases; some sinus involvement is frequent early in the course of uncomplicated viral URI

=== Cough medicine ===
No good evidence exists for or against the effectiveness of over-the-counter cough medications for reducing coughing in adults or children. Children under 2 years old should not be given any type of cough or cold medicine due to the potential for life-threatening side effects. In addition, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, the use of cough medicine to relieve cough symptoms should be avoided in children under 4 years old, and the safety is questioned for children under 6 years old.

====Decongestants====

According to a Cochrane review, a single oral dose of nasal decongestant in the common cold is modestly effective for the short-term relief of congestion in adults; however, data on the use of decongestants in children are insufficient. Therefore, decongestants are not recommended for use in children under 12 years of age with the common cold. Oral decongestants are also contraindicated in patients with hypertension, coronary artery disease, and history of bleeding strokes.

====Mucolytics====
Mucolytics such as acetylcysteine and carbocystine are widely prescribed for upper and lower respiratory tract infection without chronic broncho-pulmonary disease. However, in 2013 a Cochrane review reported their efficacy to be limited. Acetylcysteine is considered to be safe for the children older than 2 years.

===Alternative medicine===
Routine supplementation with vitamin C is not justified, as it does not appear to be effective in reducing the incidence of common colds in the general population. The use of vitamin C in the inhibition and treatment of upper respiratory infections has been suggested since the initial isolation of vitamin C in the 1930s. Some evidence exists to indicate that it could be justified in persons exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise and/or cold environments. Given that vitamin C supplements are inexpensive and safe, people with common colds may consider trying vitamin C supplements to assess whether they are therapeutically beneficial in their case.

Some low-quality evidence indicates the use of nasal irrigation with saline solution may alleviate symptoms in some people. Also, saline nasal sprays can be of benefit.

==Epidemiology==
Children typically have two to nine viral respiratory illnesses per year. In 2013, 18.8 billion cases of URTIs were reported. As of 2014, they caused about 3,000 deaths, down from 4,000 in 1990. In the United States, URTIs are the most common infectious illness in the general population, and are the leading reasons for people missing work and school.

==Dietary research==
Weak evidence suggests that probiotics may be better than a placebo treatment or no treatment for preventing upper respiratory tract infections.

<doc id="613643" wikidata="Q5442604" url="?curid=613643" title="Felony petty theft">
<text>Felony petty theft is the colloquial term for a statute in the California Penal Code (Section 666) that makes it possible for a person who commits the crime of petty theft to be charged with a felony rather than a misdemeanor if the accused had previously been convicted of a theft-related crime at any time in the past. The technical name for the charge is petty theft with a prior.

== Interaction with &quot;three strikes&quot; law ==

Though this law has been on the books in California since 1972, its existence took on new importance after the state&#x27;s voters approved a three strikes law in a 1994 referendum, when it appeared on the ballot as Proposition 184. In certain cases, a person with two prior felony convictions has been charged with a third felony for committing a minor shoplifting crime. If one of the two previous felony charges had involved stealing in any manner then the shoplifting conviction, thus upgraded to a felony, would result in a mandatory sentence of 25 years to life in prison under the three-strikes law.

In 1995, Jerry Dewayne Williams was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life for stealing a slice of pizza from a group of children. His five prior felony convictions included robbery and attempted robbery.

This scenario has aroused harsh criticism, not only throughout the United States, but also globally; several court challenges to its inclusion in the three-strikes law were pending as of 2004, but a ballot measure that would have eliminated it, known as Proposition 66, was rejected by California voters on November 2, 2004; the measure was opposed by most law-enforcement unions in the state, and also by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The main complaint with Proposition 66 was that it would retroactively resentence all offenders convicted of third strike offenses, allowing violent criminals (who had served sentences for their previous crimes) to be released.

In 2012, a revised measure aimed at moderating the effects of the three-strikes rule, known as Proposition 36, was passed by voters. This required that, except where the offender had previously been convicted of rape, murder or child molestation, the third strike must be a &quot;serious or violent&quot; felony.

== Other states ==
Texas, Washington, Colorado, Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Nevada, North Dakota, Arkansas, Georgia, Maryland, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah, Vermont, Wisconsin, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, and Arizona have also enacted Three Strikes laws for habitual offenders, making petty larceny a felony if there have been prior convictions.

<text>Saint Patrick&#x27;s Basilica () is a Roman Catholic minor basilica on René-Lévesque Boulevard in Downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

==History==
The church is known for its historic links to the Irish Canadian community. St. Patrick&#x27;s celebrated its 150th anniversary in 1997. French-speaking Catholics first assembled in Montreal at the Notre-Dame-de-Bon-Secours church in Old Montreal; however, their numbers were swelled by the massive arrival of Irish immigrants around 1817. Initially they were transferred to the Church of the Recollets (the French Franciscans) in 1825, but by 1841 they numbered 6,500, and could no longer be accommodated.

The site of Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church was purchased, and construction began in September 1843. What was then the outskirts of the town, on a sloped site overlooking parishioners&#x27; homes in Point St. Charles, Goose Village and Griffintown, Saint Patrick&#x27;s seven cornerstones were laid, making it the oldest English-speaking Roman Catholic Church in Montreal. The first mass was celebrated in the church on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, March 17, 1847, and in 1850 Samuel Russell Warren built the church&#x27;s first organ. Adélard Joseph Boucher was the organist from 1853 to 1858, Joseph-A. Fowler followed (1868–1908) and was briefly preceded by Benoît Poirier.

The Quebec government designated the church a historic monument on December 10, 1985. It has also been designated a National Historic Site of Canada.

April 4, 1985 the Quebec Government deemed the church as a Historical Monument and in 1996 was named a National Historic site of Canada.

On St. Patrick&#x27;s Day, March 17, 1989, the church was promoted to the title of minor basilica by Pope John Paul II, upon request by Paul Grégoire, cardinal archbishop of Montreal.

==Architecture==

The gothic revival building, designed by P. L. Morin and Father Felix Martin, is long and wide; the steeple reaches a height of . It is considered one of the most magnificent examples of its style in Canada.

===Interior===
The interior is heavily ornamented with motifs that combine a French fleur de lys and Irish shamrocks; more striking are the columns, all carved from the same white oak and encased in marble. It features three altars, four rosette stained-glass windows (designed by New York artist Alex S. Locke) and features 150 oil paintings of saints. St. Patrick&#x27;s Basilica has a Casavant Frères pipe organ (1895), which was completely electropneumatic.

Two additions to the decorations have been made since St. Patrick&#x27;s completion, first in 1922 by Guido Nincheri and again in 1931 by Victor Marion.
The church is known for &quot;St. Patrick&#x27;s Chimes,&quot; its ten bells, of which the oldest, &quot;Charlotte,&quot; was cast in 1774 and used in the previous church of Notre-Dame. The bell system was restored in 1989. The organ was installed in 1852 and has been successively rebuilt several times. In 1972, it was combined with the organ of St. Antony&#x27;s Church, also of Montreal, which had been demolished. St. Patrick&#x27;s has undergone four major restorations since its construction, the most recent of which cost $5 million through donations from citizens, corporations and the Quebec Government which contributed $1.4 million.

Inside the church are memorials to two famous parishioners. Pew 240, used by Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee, a statesman and Father of Confederation who was assassinated in 1868 in Ottawa. In the rear of the church, a plaque commemorates poet Émile Nelligan&#x27;s baptism in the church Christmas Day 1879.

The church is located at 460 René Lévesque Boulevard West, in downtown Montreal, at the corner of Saint-Alexandre Street (Square-Victoria-OACI or Place-des-Arts metro stations).

<doc id="613646" wikidata="Q849817" url="?curid=613646" title="IBM Monochrome Display Adapter">
<text>The Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA, also MDA card, Monochrome Display and Printer Adapter, MDPA) is IBM&#x27;s standard video display card and computer display standard for the IBM PC introduced in 1981. The MDA does not have any pixel-addressable graphics modes, only a single monochrome text mode which can display 80 columns by 25 lines of high-resolution text characters or symbols useful for drawing forms.

==Hardware design==
The original IBM MDA was an 8-bit ISA card with a Motorola 6845 display controller, 4 KB of RAM, a DE-9 output port intended for use with an IBM monochrome monitor, and a parallel port for attachment of a printer, avoiding the need to purchase a separate card.

== Capabilities ==
The MDA was based on the IBM System/23 Datamaster&#x27;s display system, and was intended to support business and word processing use with its sharp, high-resolution characters. Each character is rendered in a box of 9 × 14 pixels, of which 7 × 11 depicts the character itself and the other pixels provide space between character columns and lines. Some characters, such as the lowercase &quot;m&quot;, are rendered eight pixels across.

The theoretical total screen display resolution of the MDA is 720 × 350 pixels, if the dimensions of all character cells are added up, but the MDA cannot address individual pixels to take full advantage of this resolution. Each character cell can be set to one of 256 bitmap characters stored in ROM on the card, and this character set cannot be altered from the built-in hardware code page 437. The only way to simulate &quot;graphics&quot; is through ASCII art, obtaining a low resolution 80 × 25 &quot;pixels&quot; screen, based on character positions.

Code page 437 has 256 characters (0-255), including the standard 95 printable ASCII characters from (32-126), and the 33 ASCII control codes (0-31 and 127) are replaced with printable graphic symbols. It also includes another 128 characters (128-255) like the aforementioned characters for drawing forms. Some of these shapes appear in Unicode as box-drawing characters.

There are several attribute values - bit flags that can be set on each character on the screen. These are &quot;invisible, underline, normal, bright (bold), reverse video,&quot; and &quot;blinking&quot;. Reverse video swaps the foreground and background colors, while blinking causes text to flash periodically. Some of these attributes can be combined, so that e.g. bright, underlined text can be rendered.

Early versions of the MDA board have hardware capable of outputting red, green and blue TTL signals on the normally unconnected DE-9 video connector pins, theoretically allowing an 8-color display with a suitable monitor. The registers also allow the monochrome mode to be set on and off. No (widely) published software exists to actually control the feature.

It is also possible to combine the values of output pins 7 (&quot;Video)&quot; and 6 (&quot;Intensity),&quot; to generate four brightness levels. &quot;Video&quot; corresponds to 2/3 luminance and &quot;Intensity&quot; to 1/3 luminance), but the actual display of these levels is monitor-dependent:
== Use ==

The MDA was released alongside the IBM Color Graphics Adapter, and in fact could be installed alongside the CGA in the same computer. A command included with PC DOS permitted switching the primary display between the CGA and MDA cards.

Because of the lack of pixel-addressable graphics, MDA owners were unable to play PC games released with graphics support. However, textmode games were released for the PC (including text adventures) and at least one game, IBM&#x27;s &quot;One Hundred And One Monochrome Mazes&quot;, requires MDA. Box-drawing characters made the production of rudimentary graphics practical for early PC game titles, including BBS door games or titles such as &quot;Castle Adventure&quot;.

Another use for the MDA was as a secondary display for debugging. Applications like SoftICE and the Windows debugger permitted the simultaneous use of an MDA and another graphics card, with the MDA displaying a debugger interface while the other card was showing the primary display.

=== Disadvantage ===

A typical 8-bit monochrome card could turn the 16-bit 8 MHz ISA bus into an 8-bit 4 MHz PC bus, which resulted in having the bus bandwidth cut by up to 75%. If the monochrome card was added to the PC as a second card besides a normal VGA card for debugging purposes, this resulted in slow VGA performance. Microsoft recommended in its &quot;Writing HOT Games for Microsoft Windows&quot; (1994) to remove the monochrome card in such a setup for maximum speed of the VGA card.

== Reception ==
The author of an internal IBM publication stated in October 1981 that he had planned to purchase the CGA adapter but changed his mind after seeing its poor display quality. Describing MDA as beautiful, he observed that &quot;you stare at text a whole lot more than you stare at color graphics&quot;. MDA was more popular than CGA for business applications. The higher resolution of MDA&#x27;s text and inclusion of a printer port made it more appealing for the business applications that were the focus of the original PC. However, dissatisfaction with its limitations quickly led to third parties releasing competing hardware. 

A well known example was the Hercules Graphics Card. Introduced in 1982, it offered both an MDA-compatible high resolution text mode and a monochrome graphics mode. The founder of Hercules Computer Technology, Van Suwannukul, created the Hercules Graphics Card so that he could work on his doctoral thesis on an IBM PC using the Thai alphabet, which was impossible at the low resolution of CGA or the fixed character set of MDA. It could address individual pixels, and displayed a black and white picture of 720 × 348 pixels. This resolution was superior to the CGA card, yet offered pixel-addressable graphics, so despite lacking color capability, the Hercules adapter&#x27;s offer of high resolution bitmap graphics combined with MDA-grade text quality made it a popular choice, which was even shipped with many clones.

==Specifications==

MDA cards used a DE-9 output port intended for a digital TTL monitor, like the IBM monochrome monitor.

The signal had the following specifications:
* Type: Digital, TTL
* Resolution: 720 × 350
* Horizontal frequency: 18.432 kHz
* Vertical frequency: 50 Hz
* Colors: Monochrome, with 2 to 4 intensity levels (depending on monitor)

==Clone boards==

Other boards offer MDA compatibility, although with differences on how attributes are displayed or the font used.

<text>Reservoir ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Darebin local government area. Reservoir recorded a population of 51,096 at the 2021 census.

Reservoir is an established suburb with standard brick or weatherboard homes, and an increasing number of new developments. The suburb contains popular recreation areas and facilities, including Edwardes Lake and the Reservoir Leisure Centre, and is home to the Edwardes Street and Broadway shopping strips.

==History==

The land which became the suburb of Reservoir was first surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1837, and was formed from parts of both the Jika Jika Parish and Keelbundoora Parish.

The Rose Shamrock Hotel, formerly known as The Rose Shamrock &amp; Thistle Hotel, opened on Plenty Road in 1854. Reservoir post office opened around 1921. Reservoir became a suburb at that time, with the name coming from the three water reservoirs first built in 1863.

The reservoirs were collectively known as Preston Reservoir, which continue to form part of the fresh water supplied to Melbourne&#x27;s inner and western suburbs. The Maroondah Aqueduct was built in 1886–1891, to supply water to the Preston Reservoir from a diversion weir on the Watts River, which was dammed in 1927 to form Maroondah Reservoir.

In 1914, Thomas Dyer Edwardes donated an area of of land to the people of the City of Preston, which was developed into Edwardes Lake Park. Between 1919 and 1939, swimming was officially permitted in the lake, overseen by the Preston Lifesaving Club, and regular demonstrations of swimming and lifesaving techniques were given.

==Overview==

Reservoir is close to the Northland Shopping Centre, Preston Market, Sydney Road shops and restaurants and one of three remaining drive-in cinemas in Melbourne, the Village in Coburg. The area is experiencing unprecedented growth, with plenty of new developments.

<doc id="613651" wikidata="Q12006208" url="?curid=613651" title="Thornbury, Victoria">
<text>Thornbury () is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Darebin local government area. Thornbury recorded a population of 19,005 at the .

Thornbury is bordered by the Merri Creek to the west, and the Darebin Creek to the east. The heart of Thornbury is known as Thornbury Village, and is located at the centre of Thornbury, at the intersection of High Street and Normanby Avenue/Clarendon Street.

Thornbury is shaped as a thin strip of land sandwiched between Northcote and Preston. Its east–west distance is four times its north–south distance. For 111 years, Thornbury was part of the former City of Northcote local government area, which existed from 1883 until June 1994. As such, Thornbury is universally understood to be a demographic and commercial satellite of Northcote, along with Westgarth, although the latter does not have its own postcode.

In the 2021 census, the most common ancestries were English 29.7%, Australian 24.8%, Irish 14.1%, Italian 12.6% and Greek 10.9%%. 70.5% of people were born in Australia with other common countries of birth being Greece 4.2%, England 2.9%, Italy 2.9%, and New Zealand 2.2%. Most common languages, other than English spoken at home are Greek 8.0%, Italian 4.2%, Arabic 1.7%, Mandarin 1.1% and Vietnamese 1.0%.

==History==
===Etymology===
The area&#x27;s name is derived from the name of a property of early settler, Jobbo Smith, with the name dating to 1850. Smith named his property after a farm near his English birthplace. 

===19th century===
High Street had a cable tram by 1890. This ran the length of High Street from Northcote to Preston. By 1901, a railway line to its west connected to the central city line. A cable tram engine house was built, with the building still existing on 628 High Street Thornbury. It contained both the engine house and the car shed.

===20th century===
St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1916.

==Geography==
Thornbury&#x27;s geology mainly consists of Silurian sedimentary rocks of the Melbourne Formation (formerly Dargile). River sediments overlay parts of the folded Silurian rocks, especially near Merri Creek and Darebin Creek that represent the western and eastern borders of the suburb respectively.

===Urban structure===
An area of Thornbury, referred to as the &quot;Thornbury Park Estate Precinct&quot;, consists of a mix of housing built in the Victorian era, late Federation and the interwar period. After a backlash from residents about the proposed demolition of a 1920s Church Manse on Comas Grove in particular, the local council established a temporary heritage overlay, protecting the buildings. Old buildings, some 100 years old, were regularly being demolished and replaced with newer buildings, and in some cases, apartments. The &quot;Thornbury Park Estate Precinct - Proposed Heritage Overlay&quot; established temporary protection, initiated in April 2022, and saved houses in the area from demolition 

==Economy==
The main commercial area in Thornbury is the High Street shopping strip, centred on Thornbury Village. Smaller shopping precincts are to be found on sections of St Georges Road, Wales Street and Station Street. The Northcote Pottery, founded in 1897 at Clyde Street, was closed in 2007.

Thornbury has a long line of industry near Dundas Street (the border between Thornbury and Preston) and Station Street. It consists mainly of warehouses and scrap metal yards, with a few metal recycling centres and factories.

The Merri Creek Trail and Darebin Creek Trail run on the west and east boundaries of Thornbury respectively, and are popular shared-use recreational paths used by cyclists and walkers.

<doc id="613654" wikidata="Q1376909" url="?curid=613654" title="Guy Gardner (astronaut)">
<text>Guy Spence Gardner (born January 6, 1948) is a United States Air Force officer and a former astronaut. He holds the rank of colonel. He flew as pilot on two Space Shuttle missions, STS-27 and STS-35. Gardner was also the 12th president of the Williamson College of the Trades.

==Background and education==
Gardner was born on January 6, 1948, in Altavista, Virginia, and grew up in Alexandria, Virginia. He was active in the Boy Scouts of America where he achieved its second-highest rank, Life Scout. He graduated from George Washington High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 1965; received a Bachelor of Science degree with majors in Astronautics, Mathematics, and Engineering Sciences from the United States Air Force Academy in 1969 and a Master of Science degree in Astronautics from Purdue University in 1970.

==Military experience==
Gardner completed U.S. Air Force pilot training at Craig Air Force Base, Alabama, and F-4 Phantom II upgrade training at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida in 1971. In 1972, he flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia while stationed in Udon Thani, Thailand. In 1973–74, he was an F-4 instructor and operational pilot at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. He attended the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1975, and served as a test pilot at Edwards in 1976. In 1977–78, he was an instructor test pilot at the USAF Test Pilot School. In 1979–1980, he was operations officer of the 1st Test Squadron at Clark Air Base, Philippines.

==NASA and FAA experience==
Gardner was selected as a pilot astronaut by NASA in May 1980. During his 11 years as an astronaut, he worked in many areas of Space Shuttle and Space Station development and support. In 1984, he was assigned as pilot on STS-62-A, the first Space Shuttle mission to launch from Vandenberg AFB, California. That mission was later canceled.

Gardner first flew in space as pilot on the crew of STS-27, aboard the Space Shuttle Atlantis, on December 2–6, 1988. The mission carried a Department of Defense payload and is noteworthy due to the severe damage Atlantis sustained to its critical heat-resistant tiles during ascent. Gardner next flew as pilot on the crew of STS-35, aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia, on December 2–10, 1990. The mission carried the ASTRO-1 astronomy laboratory consisting of three ultraviolet telescopes and one x-ray telescope.

Gardner left NASA in June 1991 to command the USAF Test Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California. In August 1992, Gardner retired from the Air Force and returned to NASA to direct the joint U.S. and Russian Shuttle-Mir Program.

In 1995, Gardner joined the Federal Aviation Administration as Director of the William J. Hughes Technical Center, at the Atlantic City Int&#x27;l Airport, in New Jersey. He then moved to FAA Headquarters in 1996 as the Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification (now Aviation Safety), leading the government organization responsible for oversight and regulation of civil aviation safety.

== Post-government service==
Gardner engaged in several education related activities in the years after completing U.S. Government service. He served in various teaching positions in Fairfax County, Virginia. In 2004 he returned to Purdue University to manage research programs. Between 2006 and 2009, he was superintendent of the Riverside Military Academy. From 2009 to 2013, he served as the President of the Williamson College of the Trades.

==Awards and honors==

===Decorations and medals===
*Defense Distinguished Service Medal
*Defense Superior Service Medal 
*Legion of Merit, with one oak leaf cluster
*Distinguished Flying Cross with two oak leaf clusters
*Air Medal with 13 oak leaf clusters
*National Intelligence Medal of Achievement
*National Defense Service Medal with star
*Vietnam Service Medal
*NASA Spaceflight Medal
*Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal

Gardner was a distinguished graduate of the USAF Academy, the top graduate in pilot training, and the top graduate from the USAF Test Pilot School. He has been awarded the Test Pilot School Outstanding Academic Instructor, the Test Pilot School Outstanding Flying Instructor, and the Distinguished Astronaut Engineering Alumnus award of Purdue University.

<text>Broadmeadows is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District and the council seat of the City of Hume local government area. Broadmeadows recorded a population of 12,524 at the 2021 census. It is colloquially known as &quot;Broady&quot;.

Broadmeadows is a sub-regional centre within the northern suburbs of Melbourne, and is often used as a reference for the suburbs around it, although this may be due to its former status as a municipality.

==History==

The Broadmeadows area, home to the Wurundjeri Aboriginal nation prior to European settlement, was settled by pastoralists in the 1840s.

The original Broadmeadows (aka &quot;Old Broady&quot;) is now known as Westmeadows, which lies to the west of the present Broadmeadows. The first Broadmeadows township was laid out by a Government survey in 1850. Ardlie Street was its commercial centre with a hotel (the Broadmeadows Hotel, now Westmeadows Tavern), the police station and the shire office (the District Roads Board Building, opened in 1866).

Broadmeadows&#x27; centre was altered when the railway line and station were opened two kilometres to the original centre&#x27;s east in 1872. Shire loyalties clung to the old township until new civic offices were built near the railway station in 1928.

Broadmeadows was the site of the main camp for the reception and training of recruits for the AIF from Victoria early in the First World War. Broadmeadows had been identified as a possible site for military training in 1913, but no facilities had been established. The camp was established in August 1914 at &quot;Mornington Park&quot;, a property loaned to the government by Mr R.G. Wilson. Early on, Broadmeadows was predominantly a tented camp and conditions were quite spartan. These facilities, combined with wet weather and poor drainage resulted in a rapid increase in sickness among recruits in autumn 1915. Public concern, fuelled by sensationalist press coverage, resulted in a decision in May 1915 to re-establish the main Victorian training camp at Seymour, approximately 100 kilometres north of Melbourne. Broadmeadows Camp remained in use throughout the war, however, with facilities being progressively improved.

The Housing Commission of Victoria began the building of a 2,226 ha. estate in the Broadmeadows area in 1949. Not until 1975 did it begin building in the vicinity of the old township, which it called Westmeadows Heights. Between 1975 and 1979 it built over 900 houses in the area.

The first Broadmeadows Post Office (near Mickleham Road in today&#x27;s Westmeadows) opened on 1 January 1855, was renamed Broadmeadows West in 1955, Westmeadows in 1963 before closing in 1973. The second Broadmeadows Post Office was renamed in 1956 from Broadmeadows East (from 1923 the successor to Broadmeadows Railway Station Post Office open since 1902). It closed in 1968, the day Dallas (located centrally and open since 1966) became the third Broadmeadows Post Office. This office reverted to Dallas in 1995, when Broadmeadows Square Post Office, on Pascoe Vale Road north of the station (previously named Meadow Fair from 1965, having replaced Jacana Post Office, to the south, open since 1961) was renamed and became the fourth distinct location of the Broadmeadows Post Office. A later Broadmeadows East office, near Widford Street to the southeast of the station, opened in 1961, was renamed Broadmeadows South in 1969, and also remains open.

The City hosted the road cycling event at the 1956 Summer Olympics.

== Environmental issues ==
In October 2018, some fatty and smelly liquid were found near Yuroke Creek. After EPA Victoria inspected the area, it was found that a leak was coming from Fresh Cheese Co (Aust) Pty Ltd, a dairy manufacturing company. A crack in concrete caused liquid to leak from the drain into the creek causing damage to the wildlife and vegetation. The company was taken to court by EPA and fined $8,060. The company accepted the legal responsibility of the leak and mentioned the possibility of vandalism due to a burglary happening a week before the leak.

<doc id="613659" wikidata="Q907492" url="?curid=613659" title="Clapping game">
<text>A clapping game (or hand game) is a type of usually cooperative (i.e., non-competitive) game which is generally played by two players and involves clapping as a rhythmic accompaniment to a singing game or reciting of a rhyme, often nursery rhymes. Clapping games are found throughout the world and similar games may be known throughout large areas with regional variation.

==Nature of the games==
Due to the communication skills and coordination required, simple clapping games are age appropriate for children age 24 months and above. In many cultures clapping games are played by all sexes and ages, but in many European and European-influenced cultures, they are largely the preserve of girls.

Claps commonly included in patterns are clapping one&#x27;s own hands, clapping both hands of a partner, and clapping one hand of a partner, generally across such as the right hand of each player. The clapping may include other activities such as thigh slapping, or a final move such as touching the ground and freezing. Sara Bernstein describes seventy-nine &quot;basic hand-claps&quot;.

Clapping patterns may be used with only specific rhymes, generically with most rhymes, or improvised. Children in different areas may be more or less strict about which claps accompany which rhymes but generally different clapping patterns may be used to accompany different rhymes. The rhymes are generally very similar to a jump-rope rhymes. Some games are played without a rhyme, such as &#x27;Slide&#x27;, and not all require the players to clap each other&#x27;s hands, such as &#x27;Sevens.&#x27;

Clapping games are a part of oral tradition. As such there are a variety of distinct clapping games or families of games. A game may be performed or played in various versions found in different areas and times and often according to ethnicity. For example, &quot;Hello, Operator&quot; may be called &quot;Miss Susie&quot; or &quot;Miss Lucy&quot; and may contain, omit, or vary verses or specific lines. Clapping patterns and actions may also vary. There is no canonical version of any game though children often fight over whose version is &quot;right&quot; or &quot;real&quot;.

== Clapping Games in Popular Culture and Global Variations ==
Clapping games have been a significant part of childhood play for generations, and their popularity extends across many different cultures. While they are often associated with young children, the specific forms and styles of clapping games can vary widely depending on region and local tradition. In addition to the widely known nursery rhymes, clapping games may incorporate original rhymes, chants, or even local idioms that reflect the community’s cultural identity. 

In many parts of the world, clapping games serve as a communal activity, reinforcing social bonds and group dynamics. In African American culture, for example, clapping games are often used to teach rhythm and coordination, with some games even incorporating elements of call-and-response. In the Caribbean, clapping games may be performed during celebrations or festivals, sometimes evolving into larger performances that blend dance, music, and storytelling. The use of clapping as a rhythmic accompaniment allows the games to transcend language barriers, providing a universal form of play that unites children through a shared, rhythmic experience. 

The persistence and evolution of clapping games reflect the resilience of oral traditions and their ability to adapt to changing times. Despite regional variations, the core aspects of these games—cooperation, rhythm, and verbal expression—remain consistent across cultures. This adaptability ensures the ongoing popularity of clapping games, as children continue to create new versions and interpretations of old classics. 

== Examples ==

Clapping games include:

* &quot;A Sailor Went to Sea&quot;
* &quot;Down Down Baby&quot; (also known as &quot;Roller Coaster&quot;)
* &quot;Down by the Banks&quot;
* &quot;Mary Mack&quot;
* &quot;Miss Susie&quot;
* &quot;Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, baker&#x27;s man&quot;
* &quot;Pease Porridge Hot&quot;
* &quot;Pretty Little Dutch Girl&quot;
* &quot;Stella Ella Ola&quot;
* &quot;Cup game&quot;
* &quot;Crocidilly&quot;
* &quot;Four White Horses&quot;
* &quot;Bobo Ski Waten Taten&quot;
* &quot;Shame Shame Shame&quot;
* &quot;Rockin&#x27; Robin&quot;
* &quot;Miss Lucy Had a Steamboat&quot;

<doc id="613660" wikidata="Q4996655" url="?curid=613660" title="Bulla, Victoria">
<text>Bulla is a locality and township in Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Bulla recorded a population of 668 at the 2021 census.

Bulla is located adjacent to the Melbourne metropolitan area. Deep Creek, a tributary of the Maribyrnong River, flows through the township.

==History==

The word Bulla is of indigenous Australian origins meaning &#x27;two&#x27;. It was first settled by William &quot;Tulip&quot; Wright, the former chief constable of Melbourne in 1843. In 1851 the village was surveyed. A flour mill, brickworks and pottery works were built to exploit local kaolinite reserves, and facilities were quickly erected to serve the local population, including several churches (two of which are now listed by the National Trust), a school, general store, and from 1862, council offices.

Bulla Post Office opened on 1 March 1851, but was known as Bulla Bulla until 1854.

At the time it was the largest town in the region, but competition from Sunbury limited the growth of the town. In 1956, the Bulla Shire Council (now part of the City of Hume following amalgamation in 1994) moved to Sunbury, and in 1996, the Kennett Liberal government closed the primary school.

In 1910, the Bulla Cream Company took up dairy farming in the area, transporting the cream by horse and cart to their processing facility at Moonee Ponds in suburban Melbourne.

==Present day==

The town centre of Bulla contains a large reserve which includes a sports centre, tennis club and community centre. This reserve is home to the Tullamarine Live Steam Society, who maintain a miniature railway which is open to the public on the first and third Sunday afternoon of each month, with a monthly market on the third Sunday between 9am and 3pm with train rides all day. It also contains hotel-motel accommodation and a country fire station.

The ABS reported in 2001 that 12% of the town&#x27;s residents are of Italian descent. A Calabria Club is located on Uniting Lane.

Next to the former Shire&#x27;s bluestone hall in the main street of Bulla is the Alister Clark Memorial Rose Garden. Alister Clark, who was the Shire&#x27;s president several times and whose house &#x27;Glenara&#x27; lies on Deep Creek in the old Shire of Bulla, was the most prolific and best known of Australian rose breeders. The garden, created and maintained by local volunteers, has a nearly complete collection of his surviving roses.

==Transport==

Bus route 479 passes through Bulla. It operates between Westfield Airport West Shopping Centre and Sunbury railway station.

<text>Campbellfield is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Campbellfield recorded a population of 4,977 at the 2021 census.

==History==

Campbellfield was named after two unrelated families named Campbell brought farm lots in the area in the 1840s. The land at that time was lightly timbered, which made it easy for grazing, plus also due to its proximity to the Merri Creek.

The first Broadmeadows Post Office was open briefly in 1854 in Campbellfield. It reopened on 1 June 1856 and closed in 1893, replaced by the Campbellfield railway station office. This, in turn, was renamed Campbellfield around 1903.

Campbellfield is home to Victoria&#x27;s oldest church in east Broadmeadows. The Scots church was built on Sydney Road in 1842, and replaced by the present blue stone structure in 1855. It was placed on the National Estate and Victorian Heritage Register, and has been an icon of Victorian history.

==Today==

Campbellfield was home to the Ford Australia&#x27;s Broadmeadows Assembly Plant. Built in 1959, it is where the Falcon and Territory models were last manufactured in Australia. The Ford factory closed in October 2016 with the loss of 650 jobs.

Campbellfield is a mixed residential and industrial/business suburb, with various industrial areas and business parks around the suburb. In 2011–2012, it was listed in the top four of Melbourne&#x27;s most crime-ridden suburbs, and bottom five of Melbourne&#x27;s most livable suburbs.

The suburb has one public school (Campbellfield Heights Primary School). There are currently no private or secondary schools.

Campbellfield has a strip of shops on Barry Road known as Fordgate, and a shopping plaza on Sydney Road.

Merlynston Creek has its source in National Boulevard Nature Reserve in Campbellfield just north of the Ford plant and next to the disused single track railway line.

==Population==

In the , there were 5,056 people in Campbellfield. 42.5% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Iraq 11.5%, Lebanon 8.3%, Italy 5.7%, Turkey 3.6% and Greece 2.2%. 18.2% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Arabic 28.5%, Sureth 13.4%, Italian 7.7%, Turkish 7.3% and Greek 4.6%. The most common responses for religion were Islam 35.1% and Catholic 35.0%.

Campbellfield has one railway station, Upfield, which is the terminus of the Upfield line. The station is located on Barry Road, with the station and railway line acting as the suburban boundary between Campbellfield and Coolaroo. Broadmeadows station, on the Craigieburn line, is another nearby station.

There was a Campbellfield railway station, located adjacent to Camp Road, from 1889 until 1956, when it was closed to make way for the newly built Upfield station, which was located in a position more accessible to the community.

== Environmental issues ==
In August 2020, a toxic fire erupted at MRI e-cycle solutions, a large e-waste operator, causing loud explosions audible from kilometres away. The company stored and recycled electronic waste including up to 20 tonnes of batteries and 60 tonnes of e-waste coming from retailers, companies, schools and local governments. These waste are known to be toxic to health and the environment when damaged or close to fires. While battling the blaze for a day, some contaminated water also spread out into Merlynston Creek and Jack Roper Lake in Broadmeadows. 

The company was previously asked by EPA Victoria in March to stop accepting material and manage all combustible and recyclable material according to their waste management policy. In November 2020, EPA suspended MRI&#x27;s operation licence.

<doc id="613666" wikidata="Q83794" url="?curid=613666" title="Khushal Khattak">
<text>Khushal Khan Khattak (Pashto: خوشال خان خټک; Urdu, ; 1613 – 20 February 1689), also known as Khushal Baba (), was a 17th-century Pashtun poet, chief, and warrior. Khushal Khan served the Mughal Empire protecting them from Pashtun warriors over most of his lifespan. After being expelled from his tribal chiefdom and replaced with his son by his Mughal superiors, Khushal Khan turned against the Mughals. Afterwards, Khushal preached the union of all Pashtuns, and encouraged revolt against the Mughal Empire, promoting Pashtun nationalism in the last years of his life through poetry. Much of Khushal&#x27;s poetry is in Pashto but some is also in Persian. Khushal is considered the &quot;father of Pashto literature&quot; and the national poet of Afghanistan.

Khushal&#x27;s life was spent in serving the Mughal emperor and in his last years he struggled against the Mughal Empire who had fluctuating relations with the Pashtuns of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (in present-day Pakistan) and Zabulistan (present-day Afghanistan). In order to restore his position as chief, Khushal challenged the powers of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb and defeated the Mughal troops in many engagements. He was a renowned warrior who became known as a &quot;Pashtun warrior-poet&quot;. The stand and fight attitude of Khushal was an important stance in Pashtun history, and his opinions and ideas form a new stage in the ideological and intellectual development of the Pashtuns. Besides poetry and prose works, Khushal also wrote various translations from Persian and Arabic into Pashto. He later died in Tirah area (Now Khyber District).

== Early life ==
Khushal was born in or about 1613 in the Khattak tribe of the Pashtun (Afghan) people. He was the son of Malik Shahbaz Khattak from Akora, in the Mughal Empire (now in Nowshera District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan). His grandfather, Malik Akoray, was the first Khattak to enjoy widespread fame during the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar. Akoray moved from Teri (a village in Karak District) to Sarai Akora, the town which Akoray founded and built. Akoray cooperated with the Mughals to safeguard the trunk route and was generously rewarded for his assistance. The Akor Khels, a clan named after Akoray, still hold a prominent position in the Khattak tribe. The Khattak tribe of Khushal Khan now mostly lives in areas of Karak, Kohat, Nowshera, Akora Khattak, Cherat, Peshawar, Mardan and in other parts of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Khushal&#x27;s life can be divided into two important parts — during his adult life he was mostly engaged in the service of the Mughal king, and during his old age he was preoccupied with the idea of the unification of the Pashtuns.

He was an intelligent and bold person from childhood. His first involvement in war occurred when he was just 13 years old. Apart from the fact that he was a scholar, thinker, philosopher and boisterous poet he was a prince and leaders of his tribe simultaneously. His forefathers were since the 16th century officers of the Mughal Empire. After the death of his father Shahbaz Khan Khattak, Emperor Shah Jehan appointed him as the tribal chief and Mansabdar in 1641 at the age of 28. The Mughal king shah Jahan appreciated his principality. After the death of shah Jahan his relations with Aurangzeb deteriorated. Aurangzeb arrested Khushal . In 1658, Aurangzeb, Shah Jehan&#x27;s successor, threw him away as a prisoner in the Gwalior fortress. There he was a prisoner for some time and later under detention in the mountains prison. When he returned, he dissociated himself from the Mughal Empire slowly and started with his resistance later. He took contact to other Pashtun tribes and with support of his people he started a systematic resistance against the Mughals.

== Family background ==
Khushal&#x27;s grandfather Malik Akoray Khan was a chief of his tribe but when he died his son Shahbaz Khan Khattak (father of Khushal Khan Khattak) became the chief of the Khattaks. Shahbaz Khan Khattak was a prominent soldier in Mughal army. He fought many wars against Yousafzai – a powerful Pashtun tribe. He also proved his bravery in fighting with Afridi and later on with Mugahl army that he got the name of swordsman. Khushal was the elder son of Shahbaz Khan Khattak. Once a battle was fought between the Khattaks and the Yusufzai at this time Khushal was only thirteen years old even then he joined this battle with his father. It means he was by birth a swordsman a necessary skill for a chieftain.

== As a follower of Sheikh Rahamkar ==
Khushal followed the Sufi Saint Sayyid Kastir Gul, known as Sheikh Rahamkar or Kaka Sahib and was trained by him in islamic sciences.

Shortly before Sayyid Kastir Gul passed away, he issued the following will of his:

“in this age, no one can be as pious and virtuous as Khushal
Khan is. I would like him to give me the final ritual bath and
bury me with his own hands if it is possible for him.”:

Khushal substantiated Pashtun Nationalism, hinting that the Pashtuns were blessed with the shrine of &quot;The Kaka&quot;, meaning Sayyid Kastir in their land and that the decrets of Kaka Sahib shall be regarded as law abiding on all Pashtuns. In honor of his master Sayyid Kastir Gul, he centered his revolution at the shrine of Sayyid Kastir and announced assemblies (Jirgas) there. Sayyid Kastir´s descendants, the Kaka Khel were given much influence.

Khushal´s daughter married Sayyid Ziauddin Shaheed, the son of Sayyid Kastir Gul.

== Rebellion and the Mughal Empire ==
His father Malik Shahbaz Khan Khattak was killed in a tribal clash against the Yusufzai tribe on 4 January 1641. After his father&#x27;s death, Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan appointed him as the tribal chief and Mansabdar in 1641 at the age of 28. The Mughal king Shah Jahan appreciated his principality. Then Aurangzeb (the son of Shah Jahan) imprisoned his father and ordered the beheading of his brothers; so he made his way to the throne. Aurangzeb arrested Khushal In 1658. He threw him away as a prisoner in the Rathambore fortress. There he had as a prisoner or later and-Delhi-spent under detention in the mountains prison. He later release from captivity in 1668. After Khushal was permitted to return to the Pashtun dominated areas, Khushal had been deadly shocked by the unfriendly treatment, he received from Mughal authorities and king Aurangzeb whose indifference and coolness towards his plight had wounded Khushal&#x27;s ego. He used to say, &quot;I had done nothing wrong against the interests of the king or the empire&quot;. Mughal authorities continued to offer him with temptations in order to reclaim him to their service but Khushal resisted all such offers and made it clear to the Mughals that &quot;I served your cause to the best of my honesty, I subdued and killed my own Pashtuns to promote the Empire’s interests but my services and my loyalty did not make me a Mughal&quot;. According to Khushal, he was burning from inside for exacting revenge but preferred to keep silent. Nevertheless, the Mughals were not inclined to bear his aloofness and therefore he was challenged either &quot;to be friend or foe&quot; as the interests of empire knew no impartiality. Khushal decided to be a foe and joined Darya Khan Afridi and Aimal Khan Mohmand in their fight and wars against Mughals. He dissociated himself from the Mughal Empire slowly and started with his resistance later, he incited the Afghan tribes to rebel against the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. He took contact to other Pashtoon tribes and with support of his people he started a systematic resistance against the Mughals. Khushal joined a rebellion of Khattak, Momand, Safi and Afridi tribes against the Mughals. In the Mughal Empire, The Pashtun tribesmen of the Empire were considered the bedrock of the Mughal Army. They were the Empire&#x27;s northwestern defense from the threat bulwark in the North-West as well as the main fighting force against the rebellions of the Sikhs in the Punjab and the Marathas in the Deccan. The Pashtun revolt in 1672 began under the leadership of the warrior poet Khushal Khan Khattak. The revolt was triggered when Mughal soldiers under the orders of the Mughal Governor Amir Khan allegedly attempted to molest and sexually touch a woman of the Safi tribe in modern-day Kunar. The Safi tribe retaliated and killed the Mughal soldiers. This attack provoked a reprisal, which triggered a general revolt by most of the Pashtun tribes. The Mughal King Aurangzeb ordered the Safi tribal elders to hand over the killers. The Safi, Afridi, Mohmand, Shinwari and Khattak tribes came together to protect the Safi men accused of badal. Attempting to reassert his authority, Amir Khan on the orders of Aurangzeb led a large Mughal Army to the Khyber Pass, where the army was surrounded by Pashtun tribesmen and routed. Afghan sources claim that Aurangzeb suffered a humiliating defeat, with a reported loss of 40,000 Mughal soldiers and with only four men, including the Governor managing to escape. In a Battle he lost his Dear and Trustworthy friends Aimal Khan Mohmand and Darya Khan Afridi. Khushal greatly praised the bravery and courage of Darya Khan Afridi and Aimal Khan Mohmand who had destroyed the entire Mughal army in the Khyber Pass in 1672. As he said about his these two close companions: &quot;Aimal Khan Mohmand and Darya Khan Afridi, from death God preserve them, Never have they failed me at the time of need&quot;.

After that the revolt spread, with the Mughals suffering a near total collapse of their authority along the Pashtun belt. The closure of the important Attock-to-Kabul trade route along the Grand Trunk road was particularly critical. By 1674, the situation had deteriorated to a point where Aurangzeb himself camped at Attock to personally take charge. Switching to diplomacy and bribery along with force of arms, the Mughals eventually split the rebellion and while they never managed to wield effective authority outside the main trade route, the revolt was partially suppressed. However, the long term anarchy on the Mughal frontier that prevailed as a consequence ensured that Nader Shah&#x27;s Khorasanian forces half a century later faced little resistance on the road to Delhi.

== Death and tribute ==
Khushal continued to resist the Mughals on war fronts. It must also be worth mentioning that the son of Khushal Khan Khattak named as &quot;Behram Khan Khattak&quot; also turned to be enemy of Khushal Khan Khattak. He wanted to snatch the senior position of the tribe and joined hands with mughals to kill his own father. The hate for Behram khan is also depicted from the poetry of Khushal Khan khattak. These wars according to historians shook the foundations of the Mughal Empire. Khushal visited the far flung areas, met with Pashtun tribal chiefs, particularly the Yousafzais, negotiated with them to bring about unity in Pashtun ranks against Mughals but failed in his efforts and returned broken hearted. After failing to unite the Pashtun tribes, Khushal retired as a warrior and focused on writing. Khushal had written many poems mostly patriotic about his roots, about his tribe, about his nation and triumphs over invaders. Upon his retirement, his 57 sons began fighting for leadership. Meanwhile, the Mughals had bribed his son Behram Khan to arrest or to kill Khushal. Bahram joined forces with Mughals set to capture his father, and before he could do so, Khushal Khan fled into Afridi territory in Tirah assisted by his two sons Nusrat Khan and Gohar Khan. Khushal died at the age of 76 on Friday, 20 February 1689 at Dambara. People searched for him and found his dead body a number of days later with his sword and the carcass of his horse (known as &quot;Silai&quot; in Pashto, which means Wind).

&lt;poem&gt;
The art of chieftainship thou hast not learned, 
Bahrain in your time you have dishonored the chieftainship,
From now on don&#x27;t count yourself amongst my sons,
That is the last prayer breathed by Khushal the Khattak.
&lt;/poem&gt;
He desired before his death that he should be buried in a place where &quot;the dust of Mughal horses’ hoofs may not fall on his grave.&quot; His wishes were carried out by his friend and his remains were laid at‘Chashmai’ village in the Akora Khattak in Khattaks hills, where many Pashtuns continue to pay tribute and visit his tomb. His grave carries the inscription: &quot;Da Afghan Pa nang mai watarala toora, nangyalai da zamanai Khushal Khattak Yam&quot; (trans.: &quot;I have taken up the sword to defend the pride of the Afghan, I am Khushal Khattak, the honorable man of the age.&quot;)

Allama Muhammad Iqbal called Khushal the Hakeem and Tabeeb (physician) of Afghan Millat and Afghan Shanas. Maj: Roverty and certain other orientalists say that Khushal was not only Afghan Shanas but like Goethe and Shakespeare he was also a great Insan- Shanas (one who knows man) Iqbal expressed his desire that if he knew Pashto he would have translated Khushal&#x27;s poetry into Urdu or Persian.

Khushal was a practical man. He manifested all those qualities in his living conduct which he wanted to see in a man. Allama Muhammad Iqbal, the national poet of Pakistan, said about Khushal:

&lt;poem&gt;
That Afghan shanas (Khushal Khan Khattak) said well,

He expressed what he saw save any hesitation.
He was the Hakeem (Philosopher) of Afghan nation.
He was the physician of Afghan cause.
He stated the secrets of nation boldly.
He was rendering and said the right very wisely.
&lt;/poem&gt;

At another place he commends Khushal in these words:

&lt;poem&gt;
I am tribal and am lost in the unity of nation.
To elevate the name of Afghans
I love these young people who puts the halter on stars
This son of mountains is never less than the Mughals
O’companion! May I tell you the secrets of my heart?
Khushal Khan likes that grave where the dust of Mughal’s horse’s boots could not fall.
&lt;/poem&gt;

== Struggle for peace and national integrity ==
Khushal&#x27;s struggled for peace gradually changed into national integrity. He expected that his struggle will ultimately bring peace in the region and his own nation (Pashtuns) will get freedom form the Mughal emperors. For this purpose, he tried to unite Pashtuns owing to this he traveled from the mountains of Tirah to Swat. To some extent, he seems successful by uprising the name of Pashtuns. He says about them in the following couplet: &quot;If I have girded up my sword against the Mughals I have revealed all the Pashtuns to the world.&quot; He further says about his tribe that due to his struggle they got recognition in the world: &quot;Of what worth, of what value were the Khattaks (but) I have made them to be counted among the tribes&quot;.

The above couplets make it clear that Khushal&#x27;s war were not based on his personal greed or enmity. Fighting for the defense of motherland and for the rights of his compatriots is the struggle of peace and that is a noble cause. He fought up to the end of his life for the rights of oppressed people and for thefreedom of his mother land. Thus, all of his struggles were for the establishment of peace.

Khushal&#x27;s poetry consists of more than 45,000 poems. According to some historians, the number of books written by Khattak are 260. His more famous books are &quot;Bāz-nāma&quot;, a manual of falconry, &quot;Swāt-nāma&quot;, a description of a journey to the beautiful Swat Valley, &quot;Fazl-nāma&quot;, a handbook on religious and social duties, &quot;Tibb-nāma&quot;, a book on homely medicinal recipes, &quot;Farrukh-nāma&quot;, a dialogue between the pen and the sword, and &quot;Firāq-nāma&quot;, a lament of his separation from his homeland during captivity. Khushal also wrote many ghazals in Persian under the pen-name &quot;Rūhī&quot;, and a Persian qasida on the futility of the world.

H. G. Raverty was the first translator of Khattak into English; &quot;Selections from the Poetry of Afghans&quot; (1862, Kolkata) has ninety eight poetic pieces. This was followed by Biddulph&#x27;s translation &quot;Selections from the Poetry of Khushhal Khan Khattak&quot; in 1890 published in London. Evelyn Howell and Olaf Caroe jointly translated and published &quot;The Poems of Khushhal Khan Khatak&quot; in 1963, from the University of Peshawar. Another translation was that by Dr N. Mackenzie &quot;Poems from the Diwan of Khushhal Khan Khattak&quot; published from London in 1965.

Dost Mohammad Khan Kamil was the first Pashtun scholar to initiate research on Khattak along scientific lines. He wrote two important and comprehensive books, one in English called &quot;On a Foreign Approach to Khushhal&quot; and the other in Urdu titled &quot;Khushhal Khan Khattak&quot; published in 1952. &quot;Diwan-i-Khushhal Khan Khattak&quot; was published under the directive of H .W. Bellew in 1869 (Jail Press, Peshawar), the manuscript of which was provided by Sultan Bakhash Darogha, an employee of the British government. More recently his poetry has been translated again.

In October 2002, a book on Khushal, &quot;Khushal Khan, The Afghan Warrior Poet and Philosopher&quot;, was published. It is sponsored by Pashtun Cultural Society and Pashto Adabi Society of Islamabad/Rawalpindi. The book is written by a well-known writer and scholar, Ghani Khan Khattak, who is reputed for having established the literary and cultural societies, and for promoting Pashto literary and cultural activities in the capital of Pakistan, Islamabad. The significance of the book lies in that this is the first book in English on Khushal. Most of the written material available on Khattak is either in Pashto, Persian or Urdu. Although orientalists have always given importance to Khattak in their findings but they have not ever presented a detailed life story of Khushal Khan.

Ghani Khan Khattak has also authored three more books on the Khan i.e. in Urdu, Pashto and another in English, an improved version on his previous book &quot;Khushal Khan Afghan warrior Poet and Philosopher.&quot; The book in Urdu, published in 2009 i.e. خوشحال خان افغان قومی شاعر و فلاسفر gives extensive coverage to the Khushal&#x27;s philosophical thoughts. The author&#x27;s Pashto book خوشحال دَ ننګيال او سردار په لټون کښې deals with his thoughts on ننګيال, the Hero and سردار, the Sovereign. The book was published in 2011. In his recent attempt on Khushal, &quot;Khushal, life, thoughts and contemporary Pakhtuns,&quot; published in March 2014 is aimed at giving projection to the time and life of the great Khan for the benefit of English readers in Afghanistan, Pakistan and beyond.

== Legacy ==
Khushal Khan Khattak University in Karak, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, named after Khushal Khan Khattak. A train service, the Khushhal Khan Khattak Express, is also named after him.

=== Allama Iqbal ===
Allama Iqbal dedicated a poem titled &quot;Khushhal Khan Ki Wasiyat&quot; to him. Toward the end of his life, Iqbal became appreciative of his work to the extent of supporting his struggle against Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, that he once eulogized, writing in a letter that Khushal &quot;was a versatile mind and he wrote on various subjects, such as poetry, philosophy, ethics, medicine&quot; and that &quot;throughout his poetry, the major portion of which was written in India, and during his struggles with the Mughals, breathes the spirit of early Arabian poetry - we find in it the same love of freedom and war, the same criticism of life.&quot;

<text>Safranbolu () is a town in Karabük Province in the Black Sea region of Turkey. It is the seat of Safranbolu District. Its population is 52,999 (2022). It is about 9 km north of the city of Karabük, north of Ankara and about 100 km south of the Black Sea coast. The town&#x27;s historic names in Greek were &quot;Theodoroupolis&quot; (Θεοδωρούπολις, i.e. city of Theodorus or female Theodora) and later &quot;Saphrampolis&quot; (Σαφράμπολις). Its former names in Turkish were &quot;Zalifre&quot; and &quot;Taraklıborlu&quot;. It was part of Kastamonu Province until 1923 and Zonguldak Province between 1923 and 1995. The town lies at an elevation of .

According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Safranbolu had a total population of 52,523, consisting of 49,197 Muslims and 3,326 Greeks.

The Old Town preserves many historic buildings, with 1008 registered historical artifacts. These are: 1 private museum, 25 mosques, 5 tombs, 8 historical fountains, 5 Turkish baths, 3 caravanserais, 1 historical clock tower, 1 sundial and hundreds of houses and mansions. Also, there are mounds of ancient settlements, rock tombs and historical bridges. The Old Town is situated in a deep ravine in a fairly dry area in the rain shadow of the mountains. The New Town can be found on the plateau about two kilometers west of the Old Town.

The name of the town derives from &quot;saffron&quot; and the Greek word &quot;polis&quot; (πόλις) meaning &quot;city&quot;, since Safranbolu was a trading place and a center for growing saffron. Today, saffron is still grown at the village of Davutobası to the east of Safranbolu, with a road distance of 22 kilometres.

Safranbolu was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1994 due to its well-preserved Ottoman era houses and architecture.

<text>Blow Up Your Video is the eleventh studio album by Australian hard rock band AC/DC, released on 1 February 1988. The album was re-released in 2003 as part of the &quot;AC/DC Remasters&quot; series.

==Recording==
Writing sessions for &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; took place in London&#x27;s Nomis Studio in July 1987, with the band convening at Studio Miraval in Le Val in Provence in the south of France in August and September with Harry Vanda and George Young, the production team behind the band&#x27;s early albums. This was also the final studio album to feature drummer Simon Wright.

In a 2008 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; cover story, George Young admitted to David Fricke that the &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; session was when he realised his brother Malcolm, who had always been a heavy drinker, was in the grips of alcoholism: &quot;I saw the signs. Malcolm had a problem. I said if he didn&#x27;t get his act together, I was out of there. I don&#x27;t recall it having any effect.&quot;

The band recorded 16 tracks during the sessions, including the unreleased songs &quot;Let It Loose&quot; and &quot;Alright Tonight&quot;, as well as other versions of &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Two additional songs, &quot;Snake Eye&quot; and &quot;Borrowed Time&quot;, were recorded but not featured on the album. The song &quot;Down on the Borderline&quot; was recorded, but not released until 1990 as a B-side. All three of these songs were later included on &quot;Backtracks&quot; in 2009. Demo tracks for the songs &quot;Let it Loose&quot; and &quot;Alright Tonight&quot; were stolen and bootlegged, so they were omitted from the final album cut.

&quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; is the last album to feature Brian Johnson as a lyricist/songwriter (all songs on subsequent albums were written by the Young brothers).

The title of the album was taken from a line in the song &quot;That&#x27;s The Way I Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In 1988 Angus Young explained the title to MTV Australia: &quot;We were probably a band that&#x27;s best seen in a live situation and that&#x27;s how the title came about... &#x27;Cause everything&#x27;s automatic these days. A kid can flick on the button on a TV, he&#x27;s got a remote control and he can zoom through everything and get it coming in from all over the world. You can turn on your radio and get rock coming in from America. For us, the best thing as a band it was always we were great onstage.&quot;

==Tour==

The band began a world tour in Perth on 1 February, playing 16 dates in Australia for the first time in seven years. The band played live four tracks from &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; on the tour: &quot;Heatseeker&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, &quot;Nick of Time&quot; and &quot;Go Zone&quot;.

On the eve of the North American leg of the tour (a long stretch that would run from May to November), Malcolm Young decided not to participate in order to deal with a by-now problematic alcohol addiction. Unlike Angus, who had always been a teetotaller, Malcolm enjoyed drinking but in recent years it had escalated to the point where it began to affect performances. The band&#x27;s former US agent Doug Thaler recalls seeing the band at one of the Monsters of Rock shows in 1984: &quot;I&#x27;d gone into AC/DC&#x27;s dressing room and had a scotch with Malcolm and Jonno [Brian Johnson] while Mötley Crüe played. When AC/DC went out to take the stage, Malcolm had clearly had too much to drink. And they were playing the song that Angus used to do his guitar solo and strip to, and Malcolm would just barely keep a steady rhythm—he couldn&#x27;t even do that. And he fell into the drum kit, and I thought, &#x27;Oh boy, this is not headed any place good.&#x27;&quot;

By April 1988, Malcolm recognised he had a problem and, ever mindful of his former bandmate Bon Scott&#x27;s premature passing (the previous AC/DC singer died of alcohol poisoning in London in 1980), he began attending AA meetings, confessing to VH1&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Music&quot; in 2000, &quot;My drinking overtook my whole thing. I felt like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. I had a talk with Angus... I was letting people down... I wasn&#x27;t brain-dead, but I was just physically and mentally screwed by the alcohol.&quot; Filling in for him was Malcolm and Angus&#x27; nephew, Stevie Young, although Malcolm was present on the rest of the tour and in the &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; promotional videos. Stevie would also step in for Malcolm in 2014 when it was disclosed that the guitarist was suffering from dementia.

After their last few albums underperformed commercially, this tour brought AC/DC back into the spotlight and their following album, &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, proved to be a greater commercial success.

==Reception==

The album was the band&#x27;s biggest-selling album of new material since &quot;For Those About to Rock We Salute You&quot;, being certified Platinum in the US. &quot;Blow Up Your Video&quot; reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 12 in the US. The album was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock/Metal Performance Vocal or Instrumental in 1989. In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Jim Farber wrote, &quot;Fortunately, the Young brothers continue to come up with enough inspired riffs to make the tunnel vision justifiable. In fact, the riffs here add up to the band&#x27;s catchiest work since its classic album &quot;Back in Black&quot;.&quot; Greg Prato of AllMusic called the album &quot;unfocused&quot; and &quot;glutted with such throwaways as &quot;Nick of Time&quot;.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff found the album &quot;frustrating&quot; and the band &quot;looking too deeply for a new enigmatic direction&quot;.
Author Paul Stenning however described the album as, &quot;the sound of a group remaining current but still defining the rock art form on their own terms.&quot; 

Modern reviews are less enthusiastic, being more on the negative side. &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine describes the album in a very unappealed way stating &quot;Apart from those two songs it’s largely a slog through fairly pedestrian deep cuts. And that’s really the major difference between great AC/DC albums, and not-so great ones: the good ones are all killer, no filler, with every track a finely crafted morsel of hard-core rock’n’roll so tight and lethal it can’t be reasoned with, stacked two-sides high.&quot; Ultimate Classic Rock agrees, pointing out that it while it has a couple good singles, &quot;...for those momentary glimpses of excitement, there’s just not a lot there.&quot;

==Track listing ==

*The additional songs &quot;Snake Eye&quot; and &quot;Borrowed Time&quot; were recorded but only released on the 12-inch single versions of &quot;Heatseeker&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s the Way I Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, respectively. &quot;Snake Eye&quot; was also included on the 3-inch CD-single for &quot;Heatseeker&quot;. The song &quot;Down on the Borderline&quot; was recorded, but not released until 1990, as the B-side of the Australian &quot;Moneytalks&quot; single in 7-inch, 12-inch and CD-single formats. All three of these songs were later released in 2009 on the &quot;Backtracks&quot; box set.

<text>Craigieburn is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Craigieburn recorded a population of 65,178 at the 2021 census.

Craigieburn is a satellite suburb located on the urban-rural fringe of Melbourne, ranging from the lower half of Bridgewater Road to Mount Ridley. A large majority of the suburb is more than 200 metres above sea level, with Mount Ridley being the northernmost hill in northwestern metropolitan Melbourne with clear views of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district 29.7 km away. It has an older shopping centre known as the plaza with shops such as Woolworths and discount chemist warehouse formally chemist warehouse and a new four tier centre known as craigieburn central 

Craigieburn is bounded by Mount Ridley Road, the Hume Freeway and Donnybrook Road in the north, Merri Creek in the east, Patullos Lane, the Craigieburn/North East railway line and a line that borders Roxburgh Park and Greenvale in the south, and Mickleham Road, Craigieburn Road and a line running north–south that borders Mickleham in the west.

==History==

Craigieburn&#x27;s first people were the Wurundjeri people.

The suburb takes its name from an old bluestone inn (its site located directly opposite modern day Kingswood Drive) that catered for travellers along the Old Sydney Road. The name is derived from the Gaelic word Craigie, meaning craggy and Scots word burn that means stream.

By 1865, Craigieburn was a small hamlet with a number of farmers, with its surrounding land unsuitable for agriculture. Craigieburn Post Office opened on 26 February 1866.

In 1872, the North East railway line to Seymour opened, with a station at Craigieburn opening in that year. The hamlet still remained of little importance, although a recreation hall was built by 1912. At that time, fishing and scenery in the Merri Creek (Craigieburn&#x27;s eastern boundary) was noted.

In the 1920s, a brick facade near the railway station was erected, intended for a harvester factory which was never completed. Post World War II, a primary school opened in 1955, but was moved in 2003 replacing the school at Somerton. In 1961, the Hume Highway overpass near the railway station opened, replacing a previous level crossing.

In 1972, the Hothlyn Corporation started construction of a residential subdivision, marking the start of suburbanisation in Craigieburn. Wilmott Park Golf Course (Craigieburn Golf Club) opened in 1974. The Craigieburn Plaza Shopping Centre opened in 1975, Craigieburn Leisure Centre (Sports Stadium) opened in 1979, the Reserve Bank&#x27;s Note Printing Branch in 1980, Mitford Crescent Kindergarten And Maternal Health opened in 1980, Craigieburn Secondary College and Craigieburn South Primary School opened in 1984 but was completed in 1990 and within a few years there was a Catholic primary school, community health centre, several reserves and a public golf course. By 1991, the population was over 10,000 due to large housing growth.

In 2005, the Hume Highway bypassed Craigieburn with the opening of the Craigieburn Bypass.

<text>Paul Justin von Breitenbach (16 April 1850 – 10 March 1930) was a Prussian politician and railway planner.

Breitenbach was central to the building of the underground in Berlin, specifically the line between the city center and Berlin-Dahlem (today U3). The &quot;Breitenbachplatz&quot; in Dahlem was named after him in 1913.

==Life==

Breitenbach was born in Danzig (Gdańsk) in the Province of Prussia. His father was a lawyer: Paul was one of seven recorded siblings. After attendind the Gymnasium (secondary school) he moved on to study law in Leipzig 1869 and continued in Berlin. In 1881 he moved to the town of Altona near Hamburg.

==Career==

1872 and 1873 he was &quot;Gerichtsreferendar&quot; (Assistant) in Danzig, and then &quot;Gerichtsassessor&quot; at the local court in Berlin. In 1878 he entered the Prussian state railways administration, first in Hanover, then from 1880 on in Breslau (Wrocław). In July 1884 he came to Berlin to work for the state-owned Berlin-Hamburg railway.

From 1893-95, Breitenbach was the director of the &quot;Eisenbahn-Betriebsamt&quot; (railway traffic office), first in Hanover, later in Hamburg. In 1896 he was a commissioner to the Prussian Minister for Public Works in Mainz. In 1897 he became president of the Royal Prussian and Grand Duchy of Hesse Railway Division (&quot;Königliche Preußische und Großherzogliche Hessische Eisenbahndirektion&quot;), the Prussian and Hessian railway management in Mainz.

In 1903 Breitenbach moved to Cologne, taking up the post as president of the &quot;Königliche Eisenbahndirektion&quot;. From there, the Reich Chancellor, Bernhard von Bülow, made Breitenbach the Minister of Public Works in 1906. He remained there until 1916. During this time, he was also the head of the Imperial Office for the Management of the Imperial Railways in Alsace-Lorraine (&quot;Reichsamt für die Verwaltung der Reichseisenbahnen in Elsaß-Lothringen&quot;).

In 1909 he was ennobled by William II, German Emperor, and, in 1913, he received the Order of the Black Eagle.

From May 1916 until November 1917, Breitenbach was the vice president of the government of Prussia. After the German Revolution, on 11 November 1918, he retired. He died in Bückeburg.

<text>Greenvale is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Greenvale recorded a population of 21,274 at the 2021 census.

Greenvale is located between Yuroke and Attwood, on Mickleham Road.

==History==
Greenvale gets it name from a farm named &quot;Greenvale&quot;, owned by local farmer John McKerchar. It was located in the parish of Yuroke, from which the area first took its name.

Greenvale Post Office originally opened in a rural area on 1 January 1871 and closed in 1969. As the suburb developed the post office reopened in 1996.

Although subdivisions began in 1972, Greenvale expanded largely in the 1980s and now has two shopping centres, three primary schools, a community centre and two kindergartens. Greenvale has a privately-owned school called Aitken College. Greenvale Reservoir in the north was built in 1973.

===Greenvale Sanatorium===
 Greenvale Sanatorium was built in 1905, consisting of weatherboard buildings and quarantine huts, primarily for patients in reduced circumstances, and was appropriately isolated from the general public by the Victorian Government under the administration of the Health Department for the treatment of tuberculosis and other diseases.

A two-storey brick hospital, named the Percy Everett Building, was added to the site in 1940, with the original weatherboard buildings and huts demolished in 1973. In 1956, due to tuberculosis facilities becoming redundant thanks to effective treatments, the site became an aged care facility. Its doors finally closed in 1998, and the land it stood on was sold in 2004 to form part of Woodlands Historic Park. The building was fully demolished by the end of 2006.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

==Today==

Although positioned only ten minutes from Melbourne Airport, Greenvale has been up until recently known as a semi-rural area, characterised by larger farm holdings to the north of the town centre (past Somerton Road). Three of these farms (the one bordering Aitken College is known as &quot;Hacienda&quot;) are now planned for development into a new housing estate. This will continue the trend for Greenvale in undergoing further residential development, with several new estates appearing in the suburb itself and in nearby areas, such as Attwood and Bulla. Greenvale is a mixture of old and new development. Older areas are referred to as &quot;The Toorak of the North&quot; (sic) for their grand and stately homes.

Greenvale is home to Living Legends - The International Home of Rest for Champion Horses - located at Woodlands Homestead in Woodlands Historic Park.

===Greenvale Lakes===
Greenvale Lakes is a housing estate located in the suburbs of Roxburgh Park and Greenvale, close to the Greenvale Reservoir. A new school has been built in Greenvale Lakes called Kolbe Catholic College Greenvale Lakes.

===Aspect Greenvale===
Aspect Greenvale is a housing estate located in Greenvale that overlooks the Greenvale Reservoir and the city skyline.

<doc id="613682" wikidata="Q7700835" url="?curid=613682" title="Tenterfield School of Arts">
<text>The Tenterfield School of Arts is a heritage-listed former school of arts and now museum, theatre, cinema, community centre and library located at Manners Street, Tenterfield in the Tenterfield Shire local government area of New South Wales, Australia. It was built in 1869 by Mr Merrell. It is also known as Sir Henry Parkes Memorial School of Arts. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia, New South Wales branch. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.

The site is notable as the place where Sir Henry Parkes delivered the Tenterfield Oration, a speech proposing that the six separate British colonies in Australia should unite into a single federation.

== History ==
In his reminiscences of 1913, Mr Isaac Whereat wrote &#x27;The first school of Arts was started about 1863 or 1864. Mr Geo. Wilson was elected president and Mr E. R. Whereat (aged 23) honorary secretary and treasurer. It was situated in a building occupied by Mr Raper, a tailor, at the corner of Scott and High Streets.&#x27;

It was afterwards removed to one of Mr Merrell&#x27;s brick cottages in Rouse Street. In 1869 or 1870 they built the first School of Arts on the present site. It was slab building with a single roof and looked like a big barn. A year or so later public interest intensified and a bazaar was held and funds collected. The town and Country Journal of August 30, 1879 wrote &#x27;The first meeting was held on March 9, 1871, when the Institution was organized and the committee appointed Mr J. F. W. Addision, Police Magistrate, was the first president. Great interest was manifested in the information, and subscriptions were collected, together with a bazaar to obtain funds, and a considerable sum was realised towards the erected of a building&#x27;.

On 26 November 1875 Mrs Lee, wife of Mr C. A. Lee who was Mayor and also president of the institution laid the foundation stone. It was opened on 7 September 1876, with great show, the day being observed as a general holiday.

The new School of Arts became the centre of community life with the town&#x27;s first agricultural show being held in the building and adjoining grounds on 5–6 April 1877. The founders of the School of Arts were actively involved in the town&#x27;s inaugural show with Edward Reeves Whereat presiding over the first meeting of the Tenterfield Pastoral, Agricultural and Horticultural Society when it was first formed in the late 1876. An original trustee of the School of Arts, Edward Irby of Bolivia Station was subsequently elected president.

In 1880 the Tenterfield Post and Telegraph office was completed.

During this period after the School of Arts was opened, in November 1882 events unfolded in Sydney which would ultimately embroil Tenterfield in the historic events that have given the School of Arts much of its cultural significance.

On 17 November Sir Henry Parkes, as Premier of New South Wales, had dissolved Parliament of New South Wales after the government was defeated on a Bill to modify controversial land laws created by his government some years before. Parkes looked beyond the current crisis to an extended term in office in which new achievements would crown his career.

In 1882 Edward Whereat retired and proposed Parkes as Member for Tenterfield. At the official nomination Whereat spoke warmly of &quot;...the good likely to accrue to the district from being represented by a man of such ability, power and influence as Sir Henry Parkes&quot;. Tenterfield&#x27;s mayor, David Corney, seconded the nomination and to enthusiastic cheers Parkes was elected unopposed.

A banquet in the School of Arts was held in February 1883 to honour Parkes&#x27; first trip to Tenterfield. In 1884 Parkes finished his term as Member for Tenterfield.

Sports organised by local school teacher Mr David Alexander Pike were held at the showground in September 1901 by the Fallen Soldiers Memorial Committee, in aid of the fund to erect a memorial to the local bushmen lost, in conjunction with the Tenterfield Mounted Rifles.

In 1935 A. D. Donnelly commenced his effort to protect and recognise the importance of the School of Arts. In 1937 Messers McMaster and Potts of Wallangarra, owners of the Lyric Theatre, attempted to take over the &quot;School of Arts Talkies&quot; from the Literary Institute. In 1938, the Literary Institute temporarily stopped the take over by the Lyric Theatre. In April 1938 the Lyric Theatre discontinued screening at the School of Arts.

In 1942 World War II was in full swing, the military authorities took over the School of Arts Main Hall. The military vacated the Main Hall in 1944.

A plaque was erected in 1946 by the Governor-General H. R. H. Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester, to commemorate that Sir Henry Parkes had made his &quot;famous Tenterfield Speech&quot; there.

In 1952 the controversy over the condition and use of the School of Arts began again. The Lyric Theatre and Motion Picture Exhibitor&#x27;s Association joined the controversy and tried to have the licence to screen film revoked. In 1953 the Chief Secretary&#x27;s Department cancelled the licence to screen films. The big name appeal committee formed to protect the School of Arts after the constant persistence of A. vD. Donnnelly. Pleas were heard in 1954 - 58 by the Chief Secretary for panic lighting and safety inspection.

The building was threatened with demolition in the 1950s, but was saved after an extended community campaign, which saw the formation of the National Trust of Australia. In 1957, the National Trust of Australia (NSW) acquired its first property, the Tenterfield School of Arts, which was transferred by an Act of Parliament. In 1957 Tax deductibility for donations made to the National Trust funded the commencement of restoration. After refurbishment was carried out in 1960 the Main Public Hall was leased to Tenterfield Municipal Council for 30 years. Restoration and maintenance was completed during the 1960s. After being renamed the Sir Henry Parkes School of Arts, the building became the first museum operated by the Trust in Australia, containing a range of memorabilia related to the history of Federation and the local area. It is open to the public seven days a week.

A library, function centre, cinema and theatre are housed in the School of Arts building.

In 1996 a council meeting was held to discuss the opportunity of Federation of Centenary. In 1997 a Conservation Management Plan commenced.

== Description ==
There are four major stages of construction, following the demolition of the 1871 slab barn - 1876, 1884, 1903 and 1913. These construction dates embrace different architectural style which are expressive of the separate eras in which each part was built.

The School of Arts as it exists today, is really a complex of separate buildings.

The original part of the existing school of Arts complex, consisting of a Hall and Reading rooms built in 1876, was the culmination of community effort following the establishment of a Reading Room in 1863 by Edward Reeves Whereat when the township was barely ten years old.

In 1884 the building more than doubled in size with the addition of a No. 2 Hall to the east, a new bay to the south and gabled frontispieces to the Rouse St facade. These elements were constructed in a mixed Victorian Rustic Gothic and Victorian Romanesque styles.

The Main Hall in Federation Free Classical style, completed in 1903, is a memorial to men from Tenterfield who gave their lives during the Boer War, 1898–1901.

The Billiard Room, designed by F. J. Madigan, was completed in 1913 towards the end of period uniquely nationalist architectural expression not known as the Federation Style.

The local community and The National Trust in recognising the significance of the site and maintaining, its original characteristics have maintained the integrity of the building.

=== Modifications and dates ===
Since its construction the following modifications have been made to the School of Arts:
*1884additions were made, including the steep gable entry portico and enlarged room to Rouse St elevation and construction of rooms under skillion roof along eastern façade.
*1902construction of the Boer War Memorial arched entry portico and Main Public Hall to the south of the original hall facing Rouse St took place.
*1903Main Public Hall opened.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 11 October 2000, the Sir Henry Parkes Memorial School of Arts is of historic significance as the venue for the now famous &quot;Tenterfield Oration&quot; delivered by Sir Henry Parkes on 24 October 1889. The School of Arts has also has a long social and cultural association with the construction of Tenterfield as a community and the functioning as a community facility. Architecturally Sir Henry Parkes Memorial School of Arts is a prominent building reflecting the society and era dating back to the 1870s. The building and location reflect the beginning of a community functioning politically and creatively as a whole.

The Tenterfield School of Arts was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

The Sir Henry Parkes Memorial School of Arts is of historic significance as the venue for the now famous &quot;Tenterfield Oration&quot; delivered by Sir Henry Parkes on 24 October 1889. The Tenterfield Municipal Library operates in the School of Arts today having maintained continuous occupancy of the site with this function since its predecessor, the Literary institute, was first established there in 1871. The halls within the complex continue their historical function as the main meeting place of the town. The school is the first building to be held in custodianship by the National Trust of Australia (NSW).

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The School of Arts has a landmark presence in the Town. The building is constructed of four aesthetically significant styles: First is the original part consisting of a Hall and Reading Rooms built in 1876. This was followed by the building in 1884 in mixed Victorian Rustic Gothic/ Romanesque style. Third, in 1903 a Federation Free Classical Style was completed with the addition of a number 2 Hall to the east, and finally, the Billiard Room was completed in 1913, consisting of a Federation style design.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

The 1875 School of Arts was executed in a function and rudimentary style and the culmination of efforts to fashion and a cultural centre in a pioneer town. The town still represents a community meeting place for the people of Tenterfield. The Main Hall is a memorial to the men from Tenterfield who lost their lives in the Boer War, which ushered in Australia&#x27;s independent nationhood. This (memorial) Hall is considerably significant through having been created by some of Australia&#x27;s earliest and best soldiers who grew out of the Upper Clarence Light Horse, established in 1885. The Billiard Room is of moderate significance. It became, as well as its intended use as gathering place for the men of the town to play billiards, a gathering place for the names of the 117 young men of the town who were absent in the Great European War of then indeterminate duration.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The Tenterfield&#x27;s School of Arts depicts the evolution of the School of Arts movement in the stages of its development. Its Original Hall and Reading Rooms represents a humble balance between entertainment and education objectives while later extension demonstrate a drift in emphasis towards entertainment (the Main Hall ) and recreation (the Billiard Room). The phased development leaves a legible testimony to the rise and fall in the importance of the School of Arts.

<text>Tenterfield is a regional town in New South Wales, Australia, situated at the junction of the New England and Bruxner highways, along the Northern Tablelands, within the New England region. At the , Tenterfield had a population of 4,066. Tenterfield&#x27;s proximity to many regional centres and its position on the route between Sydney and Brisbane led to its development as a centre for the promotion of the federation of Australia.

== Geography ==
Tenterfield is located at the northern end of the New England region, at the intersection of the New England and Bruxner Highways. The town is the seat of the Tenterfield Shire. The closest nearby large town is Stanthorpe, Queensland, being 56 km north via the New England Highway. Tenterfield is three hours from Brisbane, Queensland (276 km), three hours from Byron Bay, New South Wales (205 km), two hours from Armidale, New South Wales (188 km) and eight hours from Sydney (663 km). The town is on the north-western stretch of the Northern Tablelands plateau, a spur of the Great Dividing Range, and is nestled in a valley beneath Mount Mackenzie (1,287m elevation), one of the highest points along the Northern Tablelands.

==History==
Tenterfield&#x27;s first inhabitants were the Jukembal people who travelled the area from near Glen Innes to Stanthorpe, Queensland.
In 1841, Sir Stuart Donaldson was running 18,000 sheep on a property that he named Tenterfield Station, after a family home, Tenterfield House, in Haddington, Scotland. Donaldson was the first premier of NSW and made biannual trips to Tenterfield to inspect his holdings there, which covered of unfenced land.

Tenterfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1849 and the township was gazetted in 1851 with allotments being sold in 1854. 

In 1858 gold was discovered at Drake (Fairfield) and shortly afterwards at Timbarra and Boonoo Boonoo. During 1859 an AJS Bank opened and an Anglican church was built the following year. In the 1860s the &quot;Tenterfield Chronicle&quot; was published, the district court was established; the building of a hospital commenced and a public school was opened. In 1870 the population was less than 900, but the town had five hotels, a school of arts and three churches. The existing Tenterfield Post Office was constructed in 1881.

On 1 February 1919, the presence of cases of Spanish flu in New South Wales resulted in Queensland closing its borders. Travellers bound for Queensland on the Main North railway line were forced to disembark at Tenterfield railway station, the last stop before the train would close the border. The Tenterfield showgrounds were turned in a temporary quarantine camp occupied by up to 700 people. Some people chose to return to Sydney while other spent a week in the camp after which they could enter Queensland.

During World War II, Tenterfield was earmarked as a key battleground if the Japanese should invade Australia. During 1942 thousands of soldiers were set up in emergency camps, unbeknown to the locals, to cope with such an event. Overgrown tank traps and gun emplacements can still be seen on the Travelling Stock Route near the New England Highway. The highway was until the early 1950s the only all-weather road from Sydney to Brisbane.

== Railway – Main North Railway Line ==
The railway opened to Tenterfield on 28 October 1884 and in 1886 to nearby Wallangarra/Jennings on the Queensland border, connecting Sydney and Brisbane, with a break-of-gauge at Wallangarra. When the rail link to the Queensland border was completed, Sydney and Brisbane were linked by rail for the first time. The railway was subsequently bypassed by the fully standard gauge North Coast line between Sydney and Brisbane, which was completed in 1932. The Main North line is now closed north of Armidale through to Wallangarra/Jennings, and the Tenterfield railway station is now a museum.

There was considerable debate about whether the break of gauge should take place at the existing town of Tenterfield, or at a whole new town at the border, which respectively became Wallangarra (Queensland side) and Jennings (New South Wales side).

Sir Henry Parkes delivered his Federation Speech, commonly referred to as the &quot;Tenterfield Oration&quot;, in the Tenterfield School of Arts on 24 October 1889. He was travelling from Brisbane to Sydney, via the new Main North railway. The speech is credited with re-igniting the debate that ultimately led to Federation on 1 January 1901. Parkes never got to see his oration come to fruition, dying 5 years prior to the Federation of Australia.

<text>Meadow Heights is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Meadow Heights recorded a population of 14,890 at the 2021 census.

Meadow Heights is bounded by Somerton Road in the north, Pascoe Vale Road in the east, Barry Road in the south and the Broadmeadows Valley Park in the west.

==History==
Until gazetted as a suburb in the late 1990s, Meadow Heights was a housing estate planned within Coolaroo.

When still open country, Meadow Heights was known as Broadmeadows North. The land was acquired by the Housing Commission for one of its several estates in the Broadmeadows region. Coolaroo, immediately east of Meadow Heights was built by the Commission during 1966-72. In 1975 the Commission started building at Meadow Heights, although at that time the new estate was named Westmeadows Heights. (See separate entry on Westmeadows for an explanation of the name.) In 1982 the new estate was also considered to be part of Coolaroo.

Westmeadows Heights primary school opened in 1977, and Bethal primary school opened two years later. Both came commendably early in the growth of new public housing estates. In 1985 the Commission withdrew from house construction and left it to the private sector and real estate Collings to complete the estate. Completion of the suburb took until the 1990s, with a post office not opening until 1995.

There is a shopping centre in the middle of Meadow Heights, (1994) with an Islamic mosque and cultural centre,(2007) a Catholic church and learning centre, and a community centre to the south. The Coolaroo railway station (2010) is immediately south-east of Meadow Heights.

Meadow Heights Post Office opened on 6 March 1995.

In recent years, developers have focused their efforts on suburbs to the north, with very few new housing projects being completed since 2000.

==Demographics==

The most common ancestries in Meadow Heights were 21.8% Turkish, 12.2% Australian, 9.4% English, 9.0% Lebanese and 4.4% Iraqi. 46.3% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were 11.1% Turkey, 7.1% Iraq, 4.3% Lebanon, 3.0% Syria and 2.5% Vietnam. 

23.5% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included 20.8% Turkish, 17.9% Arabic, 4.8% Assyrian Neo-Aramaic, 3.9% Vietnamese, and 3.2% Urdu. 

The most common responses for religion in Meadow Heights were 48.1% Islam, 18.1% Catholic, 9.7% No Religion and 2.4% Assyrian Apostolic.

<doc id="613695" wikidata="Q17093683" url="?curid=613695" title="Marshall Pottery">
<text>Marshall Pottery Inc. is the largest manufacturer of red clay pots in the United States. From 1974 to 2015, Marshall Pottery operated a 100,000 ft2 (9,000 m2) retail store adjacent to its headquarters in Marshall, Texas, which at one time attracted over 500,000 tourists each year.

Marshall Pottery was founded by W. F. Rocker in Marshall in 1895. Rocker located the business in East Texas because of its abundant water and white clay deposits. In 1905 Marshall Pottery was acquired by Sam Ellis. With the invention of the glass canning jar and other new competing products in the 1920s, the business almost folded. Prohibition led to a thriving moonshine industry and a need for inexpensive jugs to store the liquor. If not for the sale of jugs during Prohibition, Marshall Pottery would likely have gone bankrupt.

In the 1940s, with the discovery of a clay that required a lower firing temperature, the pottery began producing flower pots. For many years the company continued to employ potters as its primary means of manufacturing. One of these employees, Pete Payne, became a master potter and displayed his technique at the Smithsonian Institution. Since the construction of a new facility in 1998 most of the pottery&#x27;s production has been automated. However, hand made pottery can still be purchased, and tourists can watch potters create it.

In October 2015 Marshall Pottery Old World Store closed its doors. Along with its closing went the hand-turned pottery division, leaving only the terra cotta production facility operational.

In April 2017, a Marshall Pottery worker, Arturo Gonzalez, was locked inside a kiln, which was then heated, killing him. In November 2017, OSHA fined the company over $545,000 related to Gonzalez&#x27;s death. A worker died in a similar incident at Marshall in 2008.

<doc id="613700" wikidata="Q184259" url="?curid=613700" title="Let It Be (song)">
<text>&quot;Let It Be&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles, released on 6 March 1970 as a single, and (in an alternative mix) as the title track of their album &quot;Let It Be&quot;. It was written and sung by Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership. The single version of the song, produced by George Martin, features a softer guitar solo and the orchestral section mixed low, compared with the album version, produced by Phil Spector, featuring a more aggressive guitar solo and the orchestral sections mixed higher.

At the time, it had the highest debut on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, beginning its chart run at number 6 and eventually reaching the top. It was the Beatles&#x27; final single before McCartney announced his departure from the band. Both the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album and the US single &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; were released after McCartney&#x27;s announced departure from and the subsequent break-up of the group.

==Composition and recording==
===Origins===
McCartney said he had the idea of &quot;Let It Be&quot; after he had a dream about his mother during the tense period surrounding the sessions for &quot;The Beatles&quot; (&quot;the White Album&quot;) in 1968. Mary Patricia McCartney died of cancer in 1956, when he was fourteen. In rehearsing the song with the Beatles in January 1969, in place of the &quot;Mother Mary&quot; lyric, McCartney occasionally sang &quot;Brother Malcolm&quot;, a reference to the Beatles&#x27; assistant Mal Evans. McCartney later said: &quot;It was great to visit with her again. I felt very blessed to have that dream. So that got me writing &#x27;Let It Be&#x27;.&quot; In a later interview he said about the dream that his mother had told him, &quot;It will be all right, just let it be.&quot; When asked if the phrase &quot;Mother Mary&quot; in the song referred to the Virgin Mary, McCartney has typically replied that listeners can interpret the song however they like.

===Recordings===

McCartney first began to play around with &quot;Let It Be&quot; in the recording studio in between takes of &quot;Piggies&quot; on 19 September 1968. Some months later, the song would be rehearsed at Twickenham Film Studios on 3 January 1969, where the group had, the previous day, begun what would become the &quot;Let It Be&quot; film. During this stage of the film they were only recording on the mono decks used for syncing to the film cameras, and were not making multi-track recordings for release. A single take was recorded, with just McCartney on piano and vocals. The first attempt with the other Beatles was made on 8 January. Work continued on the song throughout the month. Multi-track recordings commenced on 23 January at Apple Studios.

The master take was recorded on 31 January 1969, as part of the &quot;Apple studio performance&quot; for the project. McCartney played a Blüthner piano, Lennon played six-string electric bass (replaced by McCartney&#x27;s own bass part on the final version at the behest of George Martin), George Harrison and Ringo Starr assumed their conventional roles, on guitar and drums respectively, and Billy Preston contributed on Hammond organ. This was one of two suitable performances of &quot;Let It Be&quot; recorded that day. The first version, designated take 27-A, would serve as the basis for all officially released versions of the song. The other version, take 27-B, was included in the film &quot;Let It Be&quot; as part of the Apple studio performance along with &quot;Two of Us&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.

Before 2021, the film performance of &quot;Let It Be&quot; was never officially released as an audio recording. The lyrics in the two versions differ a little in the last verse. The studio version has &quot;mother Mary comes to me... there will be an answer&quot;, whereas the film version has &quot;mother Mary comes to me... there will be no sorrow&quot;. In addition, McCartney&#x27;s vocal performance is noticeably different in both versions: in the film version, it sounds rough in certain moments since he is not using anti-pop on his mic; there are also a couple of falsetto vocals performed by him (extending the vocal &#x27;e&#x27; on the word &#x27;be&#x27;), for instance in the &#x27;let it be&#x27; line that precedes the second chorus. Finally, the instrumental progression featured in the middle of the song after the second chorus (that descends from F to C), which is played twice on all released studio versions, is played (or at least is shown being played) only once in the film. A new mix of the take used in the film was included as &quot;Take 28&quot; on the 2021 Super Deluxe edition of the album &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

On 30 April 1969, Harrison overdubbed a new guitar solo on the best take from 31 January. He overdubbed another solo on 4 January 1970. The first overdub solo was used for the original single release, and the second overdub solo was used for the original album release. Some fans mistakenly believe that there were two versions of the basic trackbased mostly on the different guitar solos, but also on other differences in overdubs and mixes.

McCartney sent a demo of this song to Jerry Wexler in late 1969 and he passed along the recording to Aretha Franklin, whose version came out in January 1970, as the first release of &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

===Single version===

The single used the same cover photographs as the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album, and was originally released on 6 March 1970, backed by &quot;You Know My Name (Look Up the Number)&quot;, with a production credit for George Martin. This version includes orchestration and backing vocals overdubbed on 4 January 1970, under the supervision of Martin and McCartney, with backing vocals that included the only known contribution by Linda McCartney to a Beatles song. It was during this same session that Harrison recorded the second overdubbed guitar solo. The intention at one point was to have the two overdub solos playing together. This idea was dropped for the final mix of the single, and only the 30 April solo was used, although the 4 January overdub can be heard faintly during the final verse. Martin mixed the orchestration very low in this version.

The single mix made its album debut on the Beatles&#x27; &quot;1967–1970&quot; compilation album. Original pressings erroneously show the running time of 4:01 (from the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album), and not the single version&#x27;s running time of 3:52. This version was also included on &quot;20 Greatest Hits,&quot; &quot;Past Masters Volume 2&quot; and &quot;1&quot;.

The &quot;Let It Be&quot; EP (1972 Melodiya) was the Beatles&#x27; first release in the Soviet Union. The 3-track 7-inch vinyl EP, M62-36715/6, also included &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and &quot;I Me Mine&quot;.

===Album version===

On 26 March 1970, Phil Spector remixed the song for the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album. This version features Harrison&#x27;s second guitar solo overdub, fewer backing vocals, a delay effect on Starr&#x27;s hi-hat, and more prominent orchestration. The final chorus has three &quot;let it be...&quot; lines, as the &quot;there will be an answer&quot; line is repeated twice (instead of once as on the single) before the &quot;whisper words of wisdom&quot; line to close the song. On the album, as the preceding track &quot;Dig It&quot; ends, Lennon is heard saying in a falsetto voice, mimicking Gracie Fields: &quot;That was &#x27;Can You Dig It&#x27; by Georgie Wood, and now we&#x27;d like to do &#x27;Hark, the Angels Come&#x27;.&quot;

===&quot;Anthology&quot; version===
A previously unreleased January 1969 take of the song (recorded before the master), without heavy production, appeared on &quot;Anthology 3&quot; in 1996. This version, take 1, was recorded on 25 January 1969. It is a much simpler version, as McCartney had not written the final verse yet (&quot;And when the night is cloudy ... I wake up to the sound of music ...&quot;). Instead, the first verse is repeated. The track, as released on &quot;Anthology 3&quot; also features studio talk between Lennon and McCartney prior to a 31 January 1969 take:
Also, at the end of the song on the &quot;Anthology 3&quot; version, Lennon can be heard saying, following another 31 January take, &quot;I think that was rather grand. I&#x27;d take one home with me. OK let&#x27;s track it. (Gasps) You bounder, you cheat!&quot; (This is a reference to the no-overdub policy that the Beatles had adopted for the &quot;Get Back&quot; project – &quot;tracking&quot; refers to double tracking the vocals on a recording.) The running time of the &quot;Anthology&quot; version is 4:05.

===&quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; version===

Still another version of the song appeared on the &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; album in 2003. The majority of this remix is take 27-A from 31 January 1969, with parts of take 27-B (as used in the film &quot;Let It Be&quot;), including the subdued guitar solo, spliced in.

This version contains a different piano track than the one on the studio and single versions. This piano track was taken in part from take 28 which was subsequently released and can be heard on the Super Deluxe re-release of the &quot;Let It Be&quot; album in 2021. In the intro, McCartney plays an extra A bass note during the A minor chord (very similar to the way he plays the intro in the film version); he also plays a standard A minor chord in the piano at the first beat of measure two in the last verse (on the lyric &quot;mother&quot;, also like in the film version), while the other versions have a different piano harmonisation which can be easily interpreted as an unfixed mistake. The backing vocals in the chorus of this version are similar to those in the single version, but are significantly reduced in volume while still retaining a reverb-heavy, choral effect. Ringo Starr disliked Phil Spector&#x27;s version where Starr&#x27;s drumming was augmented by Spector&#x27;s &quot;tape-delay-effect&quot; to his hi-hats during the song&#x27;s second verse and added shakers, so &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; features his original &quot;stripped-down-approach&quot; drumming. Also departed were the tom-tom overdub rolls, heard after the guitar solo during the third verse. Starr also commented that after the release of &quot;Naked&quot;, he would now have to listen to McCartney saying, &quot;I told you so&quot;, when talking about Spector&#x27;s production. The song&#x27;s running time on &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; is 3:52.

===Glyn Johns mixes===

Glyn Johns mixed the song on 28 May 1969 as he finished the mixing for the &quot;Get Back&quot; album. This version was not released at the time. He used the same mix on 5 January 1970, which was an attempt to compile an acceptable version of the LP; this version best exemplifies Glyn&#x27;s drum recording techniques. Again, this version of the LP was never officially released. The 1969 Glyn Johns version of the LP was included in the 2021 &quot;Super Deluxe&quot; release of &quot;Let It Be&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In his review of the single, for the &quot;NME&quot;, Derek Johnson admired McCartney&#x27;s performance and the lyrics&#x27; &quot;pseudo-religious&quot; qualities. Although he considered that the melody paled beside some of the band&#x27;s previous singles, Johnson added: &quot;As ever with The Beatles, this is a record to stop you dead in your tracks and compel you to listen attentively.&quot; John Gabree of &quot;High Fidelity&quot; magazine found the lyrics &quot;dangerous politically&quot;, but viewed the song as possibly &quot;the best thing musically that McCartney has done&quot;. In his album review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot;, Richard Williams said that McCartney&#x27;s compositions &quot;seem to be getting looser and less concise&quot; and added that, although the album version of &quot;Let It Be&quot; featured a &quot;much harder guitar solo&quot; than the single, the song &quot;still doesn&#x27;t have enough substance to become a McCartney standard&quot;.

AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger describes &quot;Let It Be&quot; as one of &quot;the Beatles&#x27; most popular and finest ballads&quot;. In Ian MacDonald&#x27;s view, the song &quot;achieved a popularity well out of proportion to its artistic weight&quot; and it was &quot;&#x27;Hey Jude&#x27;, without the musical and emotional release&quot;. Former &quot;Creem&quot; critic Richard Riegel included it on his 1996 list of the ten most overrated Beatles tracks, saying that, like Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot;, the song &quot;cater[ed] to the lowest-common-denominator emotional stasis of its listeners. &#x27;Let It Be&#x27; left the Beatles &quot;no&quot; artistic choice but dissolution.&quot;

Lennon also commented disparagingly on &quot;Let It Be&quot;. In his 1980 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, he disavowed any involvement with composing the song, saying: &quot;That&#x27;s Paul. What can you say? Nothing to do with the Beatles. It could&#x27;ve been Wings. I don&#x27;t know what he&#x27;s thinking when he writes &#x27;Let It Be&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;Let It Be&quot; was ranked number 2 on CILQ-FM&#x27;s 2000 list of the &quot;Top 500 Pure Rock Songs
Of The Century&quot;. In 2004, the song was included on Grammy Hall of Fame. &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Let It Be&quot; at number 50 in its 2006 list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;. In a similar list compiled in 2010, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed it at number 8. The magazine also ranked the track at number 20 on its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. &quot;Let It Be&quot; holds the top spot on &quot;The Fans&#x27; Top 10&quot; poll included in &quot;The 100 Best Beatles Songs: An Informed Fan&#x27;s Guide&quot; by Stephen J. Spignesi and Michael Lewis. The song is ranked third on the 100 Best Beatles Songs list, behind &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, and continues to bring about numerous pop culture references.

==Music video==
On 10 May 2024, a new official music video for the song was released on the band&#x27;s YouTube channel, featuring clips from the 1970 film Let It Be.

==Live performances==
Film of the Beatles performance was shown on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on 1 March 1970.

Although the song is performed regularly during McCartney&#x27;s performances, there are a few notable performances.
* On 13 July 1985, McCartney performed &quot;Let It Be&quot; as one of the closing acts of the Live Aid charity concert in front of an estimated global television audience exceeding one billion people. It was beset by technical difficulties when his microphone failed for the first two minutes of his piano performance, making it difficult for television viewers and impossible for those in the stadium to hear him. As a result, previous performers David Bowie, Bob Geldof, Alison Moyet and Pete Townshend returned to the stage to back him up. He later joked about changing the lyrics to &quot;There will be some feedback, let it be&quot;. He re-recorded his vocals afterwards for future home video releases.
* Along with a 700-person congregation, McCartney, Harrison and Starr sang &quot;Let It Be&quot; during a memorial service for Linda McCartney at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, in 1998.
* McCartney also led a crowd rousing rendition as part of the finale of the Concert for New York City, a benefit concert he organised, featuring many famous musicians, that took place on 20 October 2001 at Madison Square Garden in New York City in response to the 11 September attacks.
* In 2003, before playing his concert in Moscow&#x27;s Red Square, McCartney performed a private rendition for Russian president Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin.
* On 18 July 2008, McCartney performed &quot;Let It Be&quot; with Billy Joel and his band to close the final concert at Shea Stadium in Queens, New York before its demolition.
* On 4 June 2012, McCartney performed the song as part of his set during the Concert for the Queen, celebrating the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.
* On 25 June 2022, McCartney performed the song as he headlined the Pyramid stage at the Glastonbury festival. The crowd of over 100,000 sang along, likely the biggest crowd the Pyramid stage had ever seen.
* On 11 April 2024, McCartney sang the song live at the Hollywood Bowl backed by The Eagles as a tribute to Jimmy Buffett.

==Ferry Aid version==
In 1987, the song was recorded by charity supergroup Ferry Aid (which included McCartney). It reached number one on the UK singles chart for three weeks and reached the top ten in many other European countries. McCartney&#x27;s verse used the original take from the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Let It Be&quot; sessions. Ferry Aid covered &quot;Let It Be&quot; as a charity single to raise money for victims of the Zeebrugge Disaster. The featured artists included McCartney, Boy George, Mark Knopfler and Kate Bush, as well as an ensemble chorus made up of media personalities and other musicians. Although McCartney&#x27;s contribution was taken from the Beatles&#x27; recording, he filmed a segment of himself singing to the track for inclusion in the music video. The single topped the UK singles chart for three weeks and was certified gold for shipping over 500,000 copies. It was also a number 1 hit in Norway and Switzerland.

<text>Gwydir Highway is a state highway in northern New South Wales, Australia. The highway was named after the Gwydir River, which in turn was named after a locale in Wales.

==Route==

Gwydir Highway traverses the New England region from the inland plains to the coastal region, linking Walgett, Collarenebri, Moree, Warialda, Inverell, Glen Innes and Grafton. The western termination of the highway is at the junction with Castlereagh Highway, north of Walgett.

At Moree it intersects the Newell Highway. At Inverell, it has an intersection with Thunderbolts Way. At Glen Innes it intersects New England Highway. At South Grafton on the Clarence River, it joins Big River Way and Summerland Way. Between Glen Innes and South Grafton, Gwydir Highway runs between the Gibraltar Range and Washpool National Parks.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Gwydir Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 12) from the intersection with North Coast Highway (today Pacific Highway) in South Grafton, via Buccarumbi, Glen Innes, Inverell, Moree to the crossing of the Barwon River at Mogil Mogil, and Main Road No. 68 was declared along its future alignment from Walgett via Collarenabri to Mogil Mogil (and continuing northwards to the state border with Queensland, and westwards via Brewarrina, Bourke, Louth, Wilcannia, Menindee, Pooncarrie and Wentworth to the state border with South Australia) on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highway 12 and Trunk Road 68 on 8 April 1929. In late 1929, the western end was amended to terminate via Grawan Bridge at Collarenebri instead.

In December 1960, a 160-kilometre deviation between Glen Innes and Grafton via Jackadgery opened, with the old road via Buccarumbi renamed Old Glen Innes Road.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the western end of Gwydir Highway (as State Highway 12) was extended from Collarenabri to the intersection with Castlereagh Highway north of Walgett, subsuming the former alignment of Main Road 68 (formerly Trunk Road 68, officially splitting it into a western section terminating at Walgett, and an eastern section terminating in Collarenabri), on 17 December 1993. When Pacific Highway&#x27;s Grafton bypass opened in May 2020, Gwydir Highway (as Highway 12) was officially extended east along the old alignment of Pacific Highway to Tyndale, on 5 July 2022, although the road is known locally and sign-posted as Big River Way. Gwydir Highway today, as part of Highway 12, still retains this declaration.

The highway was allocated National Route 38 in 1962, from Grafton to Collarenebri, later extended with the highway to north of Walgett in 1993. With New South Wales&#x27; conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B76 across the whole highway.

=== The Poddle ===
The River Poddle runs south to north through the area. At the southern end of the district, the river&#x27;s course splits at the centuries-old &quot;Tongue&quot; or &quot;Stone Boat&quot; with part of its flow diverted underground into the &quot;City Watercourse&quot; culvert, while the mainline continues overground, passing through ponds. The Poddle goes underground between Mount Argus and Mount Jerome, then flows along the cemetery boundary, including the Islamic plot, before going into a culvert at Greenmount, heading for the Grand Canal.

== Name ==
There are a number of competing explanations for the name of Harold&#x27;s Cross, which has been extant for a very long time, at least several centuries, and indeed whether there was an eponymous Harold, or whether the name referred to a class or group of &quot;Haralds,&quot; or where precisely and what form the “Cross” took. Debating the question is considered a good way to start an argument in the area, since there is no clear or contemporaneously recorded answer, with many authoritatively and insistently stated, albeit significantly different explanations since the 19th century, with at least some tenuous justification to each. An aspect of the name theories is that Harold’s Cross lies on the ancient &quot;Slíghe Chualann&quot;, a major South to North route and one of the ‘Five Great Roads’ of medieval Ireland and a key southern entry point into Dublin City via Clanbrassil Street.

One explanation of the origin of the name is that it is derived from the name given to a gallows, which had been placed where the Harold&#x27;s Cross Park is now situated; however, gallows in medieval times were primarily used to support weighing scales for markets and toll/tax collection and less for executions (see the discussion below.) It is the case that Harold&#x27;s Cross was an execution ground for the city of Dublin up to the 18th century, but it also was a key entry point to the greater city where tolls might have been collected. In the 14th century a gallows there was maintained by the Archbishop.

Another explanation is that Harold&#x27;s Cross stands on lands which formed, like those of Rathmines, part of the Manor of St. Sepulchre, and its name is said to have originated in a cross which marked the boundary of the lands of the Archbishop of Dublin, and warned the Harolds (or Haralds/Harrals/Harrels), the wild guardians of the border of the Pale near Whitechurch that they must not encroach beyond that point. The De Meones family, who gave their name to Rathmines, also owned lands at Harold&#x27;s Cross in the fourteenth century.

Yet another explanation is that it is derived from a stone cross that marked the boundary of lands held by the Danish Viking Harold family of Rathfarnham in early medieval times, reputedly located at what is now the five-road Kenilworth junction on Harold&#x27;s Cross Road.

A variation on these explanations is derived from the traditional use of gallows as public weighing scales (and not just a means of public execution) and suggests that the cross was used to weigh certain goods entering or exiting the city of Dublin by this boundary, so as to charge a tax or tariff, or that a fee was charged by weight for goods crossing a ford over one of the watercourses that predated the Grand Canal by one or more of the families, groups or individuals described as controlling the area above, or alternatively that the cross[ing] was that ford over the river Poddle.

==History==
Harold’s Cross lies on the medieval Slíghe Chualann, of the Five great roads of Ireland, and thus would have been an important entry point into Dublin from the South. Much of the local industry during the 19th century revolved around the old mills which were located on the River Poddle and associated channels. A paper mill was located at Mount Argus where there was a small rural village at that time, and also a flour mill was near what are now the gates of Mount Jerome cemetery. During the 20th century the old mill at Mount Argus, disused at this stage, was adopted by the local Scout Troop the 45th Mount Argus as a boxing club, as a result of which the troop became commonly known as &quot;the fighting 45th&quot; troop in Dublin Scouting circles. The troop was founded by Rev. Fr. Cronin C.P. of Mount Argus church.

Harold&#x27;s Cross Green was a key meeting point for members of the Society of United Irishmen just before the 1798 Rebellion, rebels such as Thomas Cloney and Myles Byrne meet the commander Robert Emmet to discuss tactics for the pending uprising.
Irish Nationalist leader Robert Emmet was captured near Harold&#x27;s Cross. He lived for a period in a house in Harold&#x27;s Cross so he could be near his sweetheart Sarah Curran of Rathfarnham. He led an abortive rebellion against British rule in 1803 and was captured, tried and executed. The Grand Canal bridge linking Harold&#x27;s Cross Road and Clanbrassil Street was named in his honour and a plaque there commemorates him (the bridge was formerly called Clanbrassil Bridge, and is known locally as Harold&#x27;s Cross Bridge).

The father of Patrick Pearse (Pádraic Mac Piarais), James, was a stonemason for Mount Argus Church. The Pearse family had a long association with the Passionists and Mount Argus. Both Patrick and Willie Pearse came for confessions on the day of the Easter Rising. Mrs Pearse and Patrick himself also taught Irish language lessons in the community Scout Hall next to the church. The 1916 Volunteers, who had a training ground in nearby Kimmage, are said to have paid a visit to Mount Argus Church to pray just before taking part in the 1916 Easter Rising.

O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Jewellers on Harold&#x27;s Cross Road was the location of one of two robberies carried out by the notorious Dublin criminal Martin Cahill in the 1980s. Cahill, also known as &quot;The General&quot;, is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery.

Honour Bright, a prostitute (real name Elizabeth (Lily) O&#x27;Neill) was murdered in June 1925, and her body found in the mountains. Witnesses last saw her alive at Leonards&#x27; Corner, just to the north of Harolds&#x27; Cross. Dr Patrick Purcell, a medical doctor in County Wicklow, and Leopold J. Dillon, a Garda, were put on trial charged with the murder but were acquitted. The murderer was never traced.

There was a well-established community of Quakers in Harold&#x27;s Cross that operated a number of industries in the locality including cotton, paper and flour milling during the 19th century. They also ran a number of orphanages locally. Among these industries was the Greenmount Spinning manufacturing powered by the River Poddle, owned by the Pim family. James Pim was commonly known as the &quot;Quaker father of Irish railways.

Quaker brothers Thomas Pim and Robert Goodbody decided to relocate Goodbody Tobacco manufacturing to Greenville near Harolds Cross after a disastrous fire in their Tullamore premises in 1886; as a result, most of their employees were also relocated to the area, where red brick terrace housing was built in the area by the Dublin Artizans&#x27; Dwellings Company, in which the Pim family were prominent members.

== Amenities and features ==
Harold&#x27;s Cross has a number of pubs, shops, cafes, an active credit union, and other businesses.

Harold&#x27;s Cross Park, a small and well-maintained city park, occupies the site of the original village green and contains a playground, water feature and coffee kiosk.

Historically a number of large houses were constructed, mostly with the appendage of ‘Mount’ to reflect the parish&#x27;s elevation, and their names are remembered today but no longer as houses: Mount Argus (church and monastery), Mount Jerome (cemetery), Greenmount House (the Hospice), Mount Harold (the Catholic Church) and Mount Drummond and Mount Tallant (housing developments).

The memorial cross at Harold&#x27;s Cross Park was sculpted by local sculptor and stonemason Joseph Courtney and isn’t the eponymous ‘Cross;’ the name of Harold’s Cross long predating it (at least that explanation for the area’s name is definitely incorrect! See the discussion above)

In 1804 the sisters of the order of St. Clare moved to the village to run a female orphanage (named after San Damiano), founded the previous year. This is now the Saint Clare&#x27;s Convent and Primary School, and is the oldest Catholic school in the Archdiocese of Dublin. Beside the convent is the national headquarters for the Secular Franciscan Order.

===Mount Jerome Cemetery===
At one side of Harold&#x27;s Cross is Mount Jerome Cemetery, as mentioned in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, originally one of the residences of an extensive family named Shaw. It is considered Dublin&#x27;s most gothic cemetery. People buried there include Thomas Davis, George Russell (AE), and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s father, William Wilde, and mother, in addition to members of the Guinness family and deceased members of the Royal Irish Constabulary. The remains of French Huguenots once buried in St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Peter&#x27;s Row (now the location of the Dublin YMCA), which was demolished in the 1980s, are interred here. Other graves include those of mathematician William Rowan Hamilton and playwright John Millington Synge. The cemetery was operated from 1837 to 1984 by a private company and now belongs to the Massey family.

The creation of the cemetery at Mount Jerome in 1836 by the Protestant Church of Ireland was to counteract the popularity of burials, even among people of their own fraternity at that time, for the new Glasnevin Cemetery opened in 1832. Initially Mount Jerome was an exclusively Protestant cemetery but was later opened up to Catholic burials. There is now also a distinct Islamic plot, to the right near the entrance.

===Hospice===
The suburb is also home to Dublin&#x27;s first hospice, &quot;Our Lady&#x27;s Hospice, Harold&#x27;s Cross&quot;. This palliative care facility was founded in 1879 in a house called Our Lady&#x27;s Mount (formerly Greenmount), which was previously the Mother House of the Religious Sisters of Charity. Mary Aikenhead, founder of the Sisters of Charity order, lived in Our Lady&#x27;s Mount from 1845 onwards. She bought a large Georgian house at Greenmount from an abolitionist family called Webb who were members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), after she offered more than a rival bid from Mount Jerome cemetery. A new hospice building was commenced in 1886, and many more buildings followed.

== Transport ==
Harold&#x27;s Cross is served by Dublin Bus routes 9, 16, 49, 54a, 83, 83a and S2. Dublin Bus also provides a Dublin Bus Nitelink service (49N) that operates the same route as the 49 on Friday, Saturday nights and on public holidays at 00:00, 02:00 and 04:00.

==Religion==
The area holds Our Lady of the Rosary Roman Catholic parish church, Mount Argus Monastery and church, Saint Clare&#x27;s Convent and primary school, and the base of Dublin&#x27;s Russian Orthodox community.

Mount Argus was the official home of Saint Charles of Mount Argus who was a well known Passionist priest in 19th-century Ireland, mentioned as a miracle worker in the book Ulysses, Circe chapter. It also has long-established links with the Garda Síochána and it was officially the church of the Dublin Metropolitan Police. The first Rector of Mount Argus was Fr. Paul Mary Pakenham who was the son of the Earl of Longford and nephew of Kitty Pakenham (Duchess of Wellington). His first mass took place in a house at the time on 15 August 1856. Irish architect J.J. McCarthy was commissioned to design the new monastery.

The Roman Catholic parish church is the Church of the Holy Rosary. The parish is an active one with many contributing to its attendant organisations. The church was built on top of the remains of an old stately house called Mount Harold House at the end of the 19th century. Original floor tiles of the house can still be seen on the chapel floor to this day.

The former Church of Ireland parish church in Harold&#x27;s Cross, overlooking the Poddle and Mount Jerome Cemetery to the rear, is leased to the Moscow Patriarchate of the Russian Orthodox Church and operates as the Church of Ss Peter and Paul. A substantial congregation, made up of Orthodox immigrants to Ireland (mostly from the former Soviet Union, Eastern Slovakia, the Baltic States and Poland) along with native (mostly convert) Irish Orthodox attend services here. Services are conducted both in Church Slavonic and English with a smattering of Irish, and the iconostasis includes St. Patrick and St. Brigid. Below the church are community rooms.

==Education==

Harold&#x27;s Cross is served by a number of primary and secondary schools.

Primary schools in the area include Harold&#x27;s Cross National School, Saint Clare&#x27;s Primary School, Scoil Mológa (a Gaelscoil) and Harold&#x27;s Cross Educate Together National School.

Harold&#x27;s Cross has a single secondary school, Harold&#x27;s Cross ETSS (Educate Together Secondary School), and is served by a variety of other schools in the immediate area.

Harold&#x27;s Cross Stadium was one of two main greyhound racing stadia in Dublin, the other being Shelbourne Park in Ringsend. It was owned and operated by the Irish Greyhound Board. It closed in February 2017 due to a need to repay debts arising from a major development in Limerick.

Shelbourne FC, the League of Ireland side, played at the Harold&#x27;s Cross greyhound stadium during the period 1975-77 and again from 1983 to 1989 before moving to the refurbished home ground of Tolka Park. St Patrick&#x27;s Athletic also played at the greyhound stadium from 1989/90 up to November 1993, while work was being done to its Richmond Park home.

<text>Taste are an Irish blues rock band formed in Cork in 1966. They were founded by songwriter and guitarist Rory Gallagher who left the band in 1970.

==History==
Taste (originally &quot;The Taste&quot;) were formed in Cork, Ireland, in August 1966 as a trio consisting of Rory Gallagher on guitars and vocals, Eric Kitteringham on bass, and Norman Damery on drums. In their early years Taste toured in Hamburg and Ireland before becoming regulars at Maritime Hotel, an R&amp;B club in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the summer of 1967.

In 1968 Taste began performing in the UK where the original lineup split up. The new lineup formed with Richard McCracken on bass and John Wilson on drums. The new Taste moved permanently to London where they signed with the record label Polydor. In November 1968, the band, along with Yes, opened at Cream&#x27;s farewell concerts. While with Polydor, Taste began touring the United States and Canada with the English supergroup Blind Faith. In April 1969, Taste released the first of their two studio albums, the self-titled &quot;Taste&quot;, with &quot;On the Boards&quot; following in early 1970, the latter showing the band&#x27;s jazz influences with Gallagher playing saxophone on two tracks. 

They performed at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, alongside Jimi Hendrix and The Who. According to Donal Gallagher (Rory&#x27;s brother who managed the band) filmmaker Murray Lerner had instructed his crew to shoot just two numbers from the new bands and to save the main film stock for Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Leonard Cohen and the other headliners, but Taste&#x27;s performance prompted him to change his instructions: &quot;Murray didn&#x27;t know who Taste were but when he saw the spontaneity of the band and the audience and their interaction, he just told his guys keep filming and they just kept going and captured over an hour of the performance which was quite incredible.&quot; In the song &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;, a photographer can be seen hurriedly bringing his camera up from a re-load to cover another camera angle.

Later in 1970 Taste toured Europe, then disbanded for numerous reasons, the details of which are still unclear, but are generally acknowledged as being related to managerial disputes, and tensions between Gallagher and the rest of the band, who wanted to be recognised as equals with him (Gallagher having been the sole songwriter in the band). They performed their last show on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Belfast. Wilson and McCracken immediately formed &#x27;Stud&#x27; in early 1971, with Jim Cregan and John Weider, while Gallagher went on to pursue a solo career. Some years after the break-up, recordings of the original line-up emerged.

A musical homage to Taste and Gallagher was made by Black 47 in their song &quot;Rory&quot;, released on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Green Suede Shoes&quot; album.

In 1996, Richard McCracken and John Wilson reformed the band with guitarist/vocalist Sam Davidson taking over Rory Gallagher&#x27;s role as frontman, with Albert Mills replacing McCracken in 2010. The band continued in this formation until February 2017, when it was revealed that the band would tour under the name &quot;Little Taste of Rory feat. John Wilson&quot;, and that the line-up now consisted of Wilson, Davidson, and new bassist Alan Niblock. In 2018 John Wilson retired from the band due to ill health but Sam Davidson continues to perform as &quot;Sam Davidson&#x27;s TASTE&quot; with Albert Mills back on bass and Lyn McMullan taking over from Wilson on drums.

<doc id="613708" wikidata="Q669923" url="?curid=613708" title="Highways in New South Wales">
<text>The present highway network in New South Wales, Australia was established in August 1928 when the Main Roads Board (the predecessor of the Department of Main Roads, Roads &amp; Traffic Authority and Roads &amp; Maritime Services) superseded the 1924 main road classifications and established the basis of the existing New South Wales main road system. (the full list of main roads gazetted appears in the Government Gazette of the State of New South Wales of 17 August 1928). The number of a road for administrative purposes is not the same as the route number it carries e.g. the Great Western Highway is Highway 5 for administrative purposes but is signposted as part of route A32.)

Many major routes in New South Wales, including Sydney motorways and even some routes named as &quot;highways&quot; are not officially gazetted as highways. For a list of all numbered routes in New South Wales, see List of road routes in New South Wales.

While highways in many other countries are typically identified by number, highways in Australia, including New South Wales, are known mostly by names. These names typically come from 19th-century explorers, important politicians or geographic regions.

<doc id="613710" wikidata="Q542844" url="?curid=613710" title="Marco I Sanudo">
<text>Marco Sanudo (c. 1153 – between 1220 and 1230, most probably 1227) was the creator and first Duke of the Duchy of the Archipelago, in Italian: &quot;&quot;Duca del Mare Egeo e Re di Candia&quot;, Barone delle Isole di Nasso, Pario, Milo, Marine ed Andri&quot;, duchy granted by the Republic of Venice to him and all his descendants. After the Fourth Crusade his lineage became named Sanudo de Candia.

Maternal nephew of Venetian doge Enrico Dandolo, he was a participant in the Fourth Crusade (1204). He was part of the negotiations when the Republic of Venice bought the island of Crete from Boniface of Montferrat.

Between 1205 and 1207, or a little after 1213-1214, he gathered a fleet and captured the island of Naxos, laying the foundations of the Duchy of the Archipelago. He built a new capital city on the island, &quot;Kastro&quot; (now the main port). During his reign, he blended the Byzantine and Venetian organizations.

He became vassal of the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders around 1210 or 1216. For his lord, he fought against the Empire of Nicaea. But for Venice, he took part in the Cretan expedition of 1211.

== Sources ==
All biographies of Marco Sanudo were written in the centuries after the facts they tell. Most of them are Venetian chronicles dating from the 14th and 15th centuries. In the first one, &quot;Istoria di Romania&quot;, Marino Sanudo Torsello, a member of the Sanudo family, writes about Marco Sanudo only this:

he conquered the islands.

Doge Andrea Dandolo wrote a history of Venice (called &quot;Chronica extensa&quot;) around 1350. This text is the first to relate the conquest of the Aegean islands and has been the foundation of all later accounts:

Sailing separately, Marco Sanudo and those following him conquered the islands of Naxos, Paros, Milos and Santorini, and Marino Dandolo conquered Andros. Also, Andrea and Geremia Ghisi [took] Tinos, Mykonos, Skyros, Skopelos and Skiathos.

A chronicle in Venetian dated 1360-1362 and attributed to an Enrico Dandolo gives a short biography of Marco Sanudo, starting with his struggle in Crete against Enrico Pescatore. But the text is not reliable; most of it is either invented or contradicted by official documents. Also, it is the first text to state that Marco Sanudo and Doge Enrico Dandolo were related. In 1454, Flavio Biondo published his &quot;De Origine et gestis Venetorum&quot;, in which he copied Andrea Dandolo&#x27;s account and introduced the idea of the Venetian Republic giving to its citizens the official right to conquer lands in the Orient, as long as they would never be transmitted to a non-Venetian. This rule, asserted in the 15th century, is thus extended to the start of the 13th century by Biondo.

The most commonly used chronicle, because it gives a lot of geographical and chronological details, is the one written by Daniele Barbaro in the 16th century. He combined different older chronicles to create a coherent story based on the accounts of the two Dandolos. His version is the one used by all later writers and historians, such as J. K. Fotheringham in 1915. Guillaume Saint-Guillain, in a 2004 article, suggests another interpretation, based on his recent works on official documents.

The &quot;Histoire nouvelle des anciens Ducs de l&#x27;Archipel&quot;, another widely used account, was written in the second half of the 17th century by a French Jesuit from Naxos monastery, Father Saulger.

==Biography==

=== Family and youth ===

The Sanudo family may have originated in Eraclea where Marco Sanudo&#x27;s ancestors held charges. The family came to the Venetian islands at the beginning of the 9th century after their city was destroyed. The family may have for a time been called Candiano and under that name given doges to the City: Pietro I Candiano (887), Pietro II Candiano (932–939), Pietro III Candiano Canuto (white hair) or Sanuto (wise) (942–959), Pietro IV Candiano (959–976) and Vitale Candiano (978–979). The last Candiani (11th century) may have tried to take power in the Republic and keep it hereditarily in their family. Thus discredited, the name disappeared, and afterwards, only the Sanudo family exists. Note: Candiano derives from Candia, as Crete was called in Venetian, so, &quot;Candiano&quot; means &quot;the Cretan&quot;, as &quot;Napolitano&quot; means &quot;the Neapolitan&quot;.

Four generations after Pietro IV, a Marco Sanudo is recorded (second half of the 11th century) as a &quot;councilor&quot; and &quot;captain&quot;. He might also have been ambassador to Constantinople where he might have negotiated the Byzantine Emperor&#x27;s recognition of Venice&#x27;s domination over Dalmatia and Croatia circa 1084-1085. He might then have built numerous friendships and relations in Greece and around the Aegean Sea. He was then nicknamed &quot;Costantinopolitani&quot; (the &quot;Constantinopolitan&quot;). He had a son, Pietro, of whom we only know that he married a sister of Enrico Dandolo. Pietro and Zabarella had at least three sons: Marco, Bernardo et Lunardo.

Bernardo Sanudo, as a young man, was among the electors of Doge Enrico Dandolo in 1192. Lunardo was one of the officers commanding the Venetian fleet attacking Abydos in 1196. Lunardo, or according to other Venetian chronicles, Bernardo, was &quot;Capitan delle Navi&quot; (Commander of a portion of the Venetian fleet) for Enrico Dandolo during the conquest of Constantinople in 1204.

Marco Sanudo&#x27;s date of birth is not known for certain. It is often calculated by deducing his probable age at his probable death. According to the Père Saulger, he would have been 67 in 1220. He might therefore have been born around 1153. He is first mentioned in the medieval chronicles aboard Venetian galleys circa 1176-1177 when 30 galleys from Venice, under the command of Doge Sebastian Ziani clashed against 75 galleys commanded by Otto I, Count of Burgundy, son of Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor. But the historic existence of this battle is not certain.

Thus, the first certain fact known about Marco Sanudo is that he took part in the Fourth Crusade. He was noted for his courage during the captures of Zara and Constantinople, but with no other details. But, his name is not among those of the officers commanding galleys. It is probable he was aboard a galley commanded by one of his brothers (Bernardo or Lunardo) or by his uncle Enrico Dandolo.

=== Conquest of the Cyclades ===

==== The Cyclades at the beginning of the 13th century ====
After Heraclius, the Byzantine Empire was organized in themes. In the 10th century, a theme of the Aegean Sea (&quot;tò théma toû Aiyaíou Pelágous&quot;) ruled by an admiral (&quot;dhrungarios&quot;) was created. It included the Cyclades, Sporades, Chios, Lesbos and Lemnos. But quickly, the central government was no longer capable to control these small and scattered lands. At the beginning of the 13th century, it had given up the very idea altogether. It appears the Cyclades might then have been ruled from Rhodes by a former Byzantine civil servant Leo Gabalas self-styled &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Lord of Rhodes and the Cyclades&quot;. But even he was not able to collect the taxes, mainly because of Genoese and Turkish pirates.

At that time, inhabitants left villages by the sea to create new ones in the mountains, such as the villages on the Traghea plateau on Naxos.

==== Competition between Venice and Genoa ====

After the 11th century, Italian merchant cities, mainly the Republic of Venice and Republic of Genoa, developed their trade with the Orient, mostly Constantinople and Egypt, the first stages of the silk road. Trade routes of both cities were almost identical. Venetian boats ran alongside the East coast of the Adriatic Sea with stops in Zara, Dyrrachium and Corfu, then around the Peloponnese with Koroni and up the Aegean and Cyclades with stops in Naxos, Euboea and Thessaloniki to Constantinople, or via Crete, Alexandria and Syria to Egypt. The Genoan ships ran alongside the West coast of Italy, crossed the Strait of Messina then the Strait of Otranto to Corfu, round the Peloponnese stopping at Monemvasia, up the Aegean and Cyclades with stops in Chios to Constantinople or via Milos, Naxos and Amorgos to Egypt and Syria. Thus, the cities were competing to control the stopping places.

The competition grew in the 12th century. Venice had secured privileges from Emperor Isaac II Angelos. His successor Alexios III Angelos resented Venetian control of the Byzantine trade. He tried to give more room to Genoa, as well as Pisa (to avoid giving Genoa all the power). Thus, the Genoan marine crushed the very pirates the Republic had created to cripple Venetian (and Byzantine) trade. The Genoan district in Constantinople became larger in 1201. The Pisan influence grew also in Thessaloniki. Venice could not let these go unaddressed. When Alexios Angelos asked the crusaders to help him become Emperor, they could not refuse. A new Emperor, owing his throne to the crusaders and Venice, was what the city needed to regain its commercial power in the Byzantine Empire.

==== The Fourth Crusade ====

In July 1203, the Crusaders took Constantinople and put Alexios IV Angelos on the throne, as promised. But, the fire in August brought him down. Hostility between the Crusaders and the inhabitants of Constantinople was also growing. Fighting between the Crusaders and the troops of Alexios V Doukas broke out.

Finally, on the 13th of April 1204, the Crusaders, or as they became called &quot;Latins&quot; or &quot;Franks&quot;, again took Constantinople and divided the conquered Byzantine Empire. The treaty &quot;Partitio terrarum imperii Romaniae&quot; was probably drafted during the autumn of 1204 by a commission of 24 people (12 Venetians, 12 non-Venetians). One fourth went to Baldwin VI Count of Hainaut, elected Latin Emperor, three eights went to Venice, and the remaining three eights to the other Crusaders. The Cyclades were not mentioned as such, contrary to the Sporades or the Ionian Islands. Only Andros and Tinos were mentioned: the former was given to Venice and the latter to the Emperor. Historians have tried to identify the others Cycladic islands in the text but nothing is really convincing. Paul Hetherington suggest two simple explanations for the absence of the Cyclades, even the bigger ones such as Naxos, in the text. The treaty was drafted using the Byzantine taxes of 1203 and they were no longer collected on most of the islands. Venice might also have done it deliberately as the Republic was the only one with a real geographic knowledge of the Aegean. Thus, the Republic kept aside essential stopping points on its trade routes.

In conquered Constantinople, Marco Sanudo became judge at the consular court (&quot;giudice del commun&quot;) and then took part to the negotiations between the Republic of Venice and Boniface I, Marquess of Montferrat that ended with the purchase of Crete, given to Boniface, by Venice. Boniface de Montferrat was to close to the Genoans for the Venetians. Thus, he was not elected Latin Emperor and was given, as compensation, the Kingdom of Thessalonica and Crete. But Macedonia had not been conquered, when the Latin imperial army began the conquest, Boniface rebelled, considering the Emperor was trying to take his share from him. So, he besieged Adrianople. Enrico Dandolo sent a mission to reason with Boniface. The head of the ambassadors was Geoffroi de Villehardouin and Marco Sanudo was among them. The main objective of the mission was to avoid that Boniface sold Crete to the Republic of Genoa, as he had announced. On the 12th of August 1204, the Treaty of Adrianople between Boniface and Venice was signed. The Republic got the island of Crete and guaranteed to Boniface the possession of the Kingdom of Thessalonica. Some medieval chronicles -after the one by Enrico Dandolo (1360–1362)- say that this Treaty of Adrianople explicitly gave Marco Sanudo lands on Crete. But the original text, preserved, says no such thing.

==== Creation of the Duchy ====

===== Conquest of Naxos =====

The Republic of Venice was afraid that its rival, the Republic of Genoa, would take advantage of the troubled situation in the Eastern Mediterranean to gain ground. Venice could barely buy Crete just before Genoa. Even then, the Ligurian republic threatened its rival with war if it did not abandon the big island. The war was inevitable and started. At the beginning of 1205, the news reached Constantinople that a Genoan fleet had just arrived in the Aegean. Marco Sanudo, with his uncle Enrico Dandolo&#x27;s and the Latin Emperor&#x27;s blessings, armed with his own money eight galleys that had been entrusted to him in order to fight the Genoans. All the sailors were Venetians and came on their own accord.

In order to achieve this goal, control of Naxos was essential. Sanudo&#x27;s fleet landed on the South-West of the island, near Potamides. The local population did not oppose them. The main objective was the Byzantine fortress of Apalyrou, approximately three kilometers inland. It was guarded by Greek and Genoan troops. According to some sources, Sanudo burned his own vessels to motivate his soldiers. The siege lasted for five weeks. The capture of the fortress gave Sanudo control of the whole island.

===== Political confirmations =====

Marco Sanudo had to have his conquest certified by the Latin Empire&#x27;s authorities. But, the Emperor Baldwin had died during the Battle of Adrianople (1205) and Marco Sanudo&#x27;s uncle Enrico Dandolo also died in June. In Constantinople, the podestà and the Council of the Venetians assured him there would be no problem. But, one condition was made: Naxos could only go to a Venetian after Sanudo&#x27;s death.

In July 1205, Sanudo left for Venice, carrying the news of the death of the Doge, and also to get the confirmation of his conquest. There, he took part to the election of the new Doge, Pietro Ziani. He was then authorized to take, as private property, all Cycladic islands not included in the &quot;Partitio Terrarum&quot;. In fact, this right was given to all Venetian citizens for all the Byzantine lands not included in the &quot;Partitio Terrarum&quot;.

Meanwhile, the Genoans had set foot on and fortified Crete and Corfu, threatening the Venetian power. The Republic armed a fleet to oust them. Marco Sanudo took part to the expedition in Crete because the Genoans there were a threat to his island. Enrico Pescatore, working for Genoa, with a fleet comprising eight galleys had set foot in Crete in 1206. The Venetian fleet captured four Genoan galleys in Spinalonga, then patrolled the Cretan seas, boarding all ships. But no attempt was made to land on and recapture the island. At the end of the campaign, the Venetian fleet went back home and Sanudo sailed to Constantinople to get the new Emperor&#x27;s (Henry of Flanders) confirmation for this conquest and for his new project of conquering the other Cyclades.

===== Conquest of the other islands =====
The authorization given by Venetian and Imperial authorities gave ideas to other adventurers. A new expedition, still privately financed, set sail in 1206-1207. That year, Marco Sanudo controlled all Cyclades with his companions or relatives. His cousin Marino Dandolo (another nephew of Enrico Dandolo) became Lord of Andros. Other relatives, the brothers Andrea and Geremia Ghisi became Lords of Tinos and Mykonos, with fiefs on Kea and Serifos (also in the Sporades). The Pisani shared Kea with the Ghisi and with the Michieli and the Guistiniani. Jaccopo Barozzi (from Bologna) took Santorini. Anafi went to Leonardo Foscolo. Pietro Guistianini and Domenico Michieli each received a quarter of Serifos and a quarter of Kea. Marco Sanudo took a dozen of the bigger islands: Naxos, Paros, Antiparos, Milos, Kimolos, Ios, Amorgos, Siphnos, Sikinos, Syros, Folegandros and Kythnos (where the Castelli and the Gozzadini were his vassals). Some chronicles suggest that he might have already conquered Smyrna at that time.

The conquest seems to have been relatively easy. There are no accounts of battles or fighting. It seems that all the conquerors had to do was to show up in the principal harbour of an island and announce they were taking charge. Historians suggest some explanations. The first is linked to the insecurity caused by the pirates in the Aegean at the time and only the Venetian fleet was strong enough to fight them. Locals did not care that the new lords were private persons and not captains in the service of Venice. Better them than the insecurity. Also, Sanudo did not alienate the Greek ruling class: the &quot;archontes&quot;. He let them keep their properties, their privileges and their religion. Thus, nothing was to be feared from a local population controlled by the local ruling class.

===== Alternate hypothesis =====
Guillaume Saint-Guillain, in an article published in 2006, after working on the many medieval chronicles and showing they are unreliable, uses documents produced by the contemporaries of Marco Sanudo. Thus, the archbishop of Athens, Michael Choniates, who had taken refuge from the Latin troops on Kea wrote at the end of 1208 or at the beginning of 1209 a letter to the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in which he refused to take charge of the vacant bishop seat of Paros-Naxos. It seems improbable that he would have fled the Latins in Athens to go into Latin-conquered lands on Naxos. In his poem &quot;Théanô&quot;, he writes about the Greek resistance to the Latins. Reading that text, we can infer that the island he was living on, Kea, was not conquered at the time he wrote (1212). He suggests in the same poem a failed attempt of conquest of the Cyclades in 1205, but there is no mention of Marco Sanudo. It might then be necessary to suggest a later date for the conquest of the Cyclades by the Venetians.

==== Relations with Greek population ====
Marco Sanudo was the initiator of the two main political lines of all the rulers of the Duchy of Archipelago throughout its existence: independence from the Republic of Venice and good relations with the Greek population of his islands.

===== Feudalism in the Aegean islands =====
In 1210, Marco Sanudo pledged homage to the Latin Emperor Henry who bestowed him the title of Peer of the Byzantine Empire and &quot;Duke of the Archipelago&quot;. It is probable that it was this Duchy that created the word &quot;archipelago&quot; from the Venetian, a deformation of the Greek name of the Aegean Sea &quot;Aigaion Pelagos&quot; (&quot;Αιγαιον πελαγος&quot;). By that homage, Sanudo chose to become the vassal of the Emperor to avoid ending up as a mere governor of the islands in the name of Venice. Thus, he made sure his conquests became his own properties, in exchange of the usual feudal obligations: aid and counsel.

Thus, the feudal system was applied to the Aegean islands. Except for the Ghisi who might have been direct vassals of the Emperor, all the Italians in the Cyclades were Marco Sanudo&#x27;s vassals, himself vassal of the Emperor. Sanudo rewarded his soldiers and sailors who conquered the islands by conferring knighthood and fiefs in exchange of the usual feudal obligations: aid and counsel. They became known as &quot;feudati&quot; or &quot;feudatori&quot;, living from the income of their lands. They became a new social elite alongside the Greek &quot;archontés&quot;. When the news that yeomen could become knights in Greece reached other lands, a new wave of adventurers arrived from Italy, France or Spain.

Marco Sanudo recognised the rights and deeds to their properties of all the Greek &quot;archontés&quot;. On Naxos, 56 fiefs (&quot;τόποι&quot;) are known for that time: half were in Greek hands. It seems there was enough unclaimed lands and lands taken from the ancient Byzantine public domain for Sanudo to give to his new &quot;Franks&quot; vassals without confiscating Greek properties. At the same time, in Crete, Venice confiscated the properties of the Greek &quot;archontés&quot; and in doing so alienated them for the following centuries during which the Republic had to face numerous rebellions. Marco Sanudo never had any trouble with &quot;his&quot; locals.

The &quot;Frankish&quot; feudal system was simply added to the ancient Byzantine administrative one kept by the new lords: the ancient Byzantine administrative organisation was used for the new feudal taxes and corvées and the Byzantine agricultural techniques were used on the new fiefs. Byzantine law was also used for the local Greek population being for the marriages or the properties. It was the same for the religious organisation: even if the Catholic hierarchy was in power, an Orthodox hierarchy still existed (albeit without a bishop but with a &quot;protopappas&quot;). And, when a Catholic priest was not available, the mass was said by an Orthodox priest.

Quickly, the two communities became more and more close. The &quot;noblemen&quot;, Italians as well as Greeks, were speaking Italian, called by all the Greeks &quot;Frank&quot; and the lower classes spoke a blending of the two languages, an &quot;italohellenic&quot;. Thus, they were able to understand each other on some level.

===== Government of the Duchy =====

Sanudo ruled directly over Naxos and Milos and appointed governors on all the other islands. According to Father Saulger, Sanudo created all the institutions of the Duchy, but according to B. J. Slot, there is no real proof of that fact. Marco Sanudo might have been helped by a council (&quot;università&quot;) inspired by the Venetian institution. Greeks and Latins were members of that council. Sanudo might have instituted the political fonction of &quot;vicario&quot;, who was supposed to replace him when he was away (which he was repeatedly). There also were a &quot;megas kapetanios&quot; (in Greek), commander in chief of the troops, a treasurer, a chancellor and a judicial administration. The Duchy also had its own currency: the ducat.

Sanudo changed the face of the island itself by moving the capital (the actual Naxos-town or Chora) from the interior to the seaside, where it used to be during the Antiquity. Its harbor was even better than Potamides. He built at least one pier. Some sources even say he link the mainland with the islet on which the temple is built. Some say that the chapel of Myrtidiotissa on a small islet in the middle of the harbor was built on the medieval pier. On the old acropolis, Sanudo built his &quot;kastro&quot;, his fortress. It comprised the palace, the exterior walls, a keep, a gothic chapel (since destroyed), the houses of the Latin families and the Catholic cathedral. Greeks built their houses between the harbor and the fortress, in the Bourgou and Neochorio suburbs.

He did the same on Milos, where a new town was built for the Latin families on the seaside: Apanokastro.

===== Catholicism and Orthodoxy =====
Non-Greeks were very few in Sanudo&#x27;s duchy, around 10% of the population of the &quot;capital island&quot; Naxos, i.e. around 300 people. On the other islands, the proportion was less: not higher than 5%. So, &quot;Latin&quot; and &quot;Greek&quot; ruling classes rapidly mingled. Moreover, the &quot;Latins&quot; were almost exclusively male and Catholic families were not willing to marry their daughters so far away. So, the Latin male lords found wives in Greece.

==== At the service of two masters ====

===== Crete in 1211 and 1212 =====

=====War against the Empire of Nicaea=====

==== Marriages and children ====

==== Death and successor ====
Marco died in 1227, two years after Otto de la Roche, the first duke of Athens, departed for France, three years after the Kingdom of Thessalonica collapsed, and a short while before the death of Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, Prince of Achaea. In a very short time, the whole political landscape of Frankish Greece was radically altered.

==Marriage and children==
According to William Miller, Marco I married an unnamed Laskaraina, a woman of the Laskaris family. Miller identified her as a sister of Constantine Laskaris and Theodore I Laskaris. He based this theory on his own interpretation of Italian chronicles. The &quot;Dictionnaire historique et Généalogique des grandes familles de Grèce, d&#x27;Albanie et de Constantinople&quot; (1983) by Mihail-Dimitri Sturdza rejected the theory based on the silence of Byzantine primary sources.

In any case, Marco I had one known son: Angelo Sanudo. Marino Sanuto the Elder is considered a descendant but his exact lineage is not known.

<text>New England Highway is an long highway in Australia running from Yarraman, north of Toowoomba, Queensland, at its northern end to Hexham at Newcastle, New South Wales, at its southern end. It is part of Australia&#x27;s National Highway system, and forms part of the inland route between Brisbane and Sydney.

==State-controlled road in Queensland==

The Queensland segment of the New England Highway is a state-controlled road, subdivided into three sections for administrative and funding purposes. One of the three sections (number 22C) is part of the National Highway, while sections 22A and 22B are strategic roads. The sections are:
* 22A – Yarraman to Toowoomba
* 22B – Toowoomba to Warwick
* 22C – Warwick to Wallangarra

State-controlled roads that intersect with the highway are listed in the main article.

==Route==
At its northern end New England Highway connects to D&#x27;Aguilar Highway, and at its southern end it connects to Pacific Highway. It traverses the Darling Downs, New England, and Hunter Valley regions.

During the winter months, some parts of the New England Highway are subject to frost and snowfall, with the 350 km section from the Moonbi Ranges to Stanthorpe located at high altitudes.

===Traffic volume===
In 2013–14, the New England and Cunningham Highways combined (known as the Sydney–Brisbane inland route) had an average annual daily traffic count of just over 13,000 vehicles, which is approximately half that seen on the coastal route (i.e., the Pacific Highway and Pacific Motorway). Heavy vehicles account for approximately 13% of the traffic seen on the route.

===Speed cameras===
As of November 2018, fixed speed cameras were located at Ben Lomond (between Ross Road and Ben Lomond Road), Blandford (between Hayles Street and Mills Street) and Tenterfield (between Duncan Street and George Street). Average speed enforcement (point-to-point) cameras target heavy vehicles between Singleton and Muswellbrook.

==History==
The New England Highway has its origins in the track which developed north from Newcastle to reach the prime wool growing areas of the New England region which Europeans settled following expeditions by NSW Surveyor-General John Oxley in 1818 and botanist Allan Cunningham in 1827 and 1829. The rough track, navigable only by horse or bullock dray, crossed the Liverpool Range, went through Tamworth and ended at the state border at Mount Lindesay, where it connected with the Queensland road network. The track became known as the Great Northern Road. During the 1860s, several robberies occurred along the road, with infamous bushranger Captain Thunderbolt known to be active in the area.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). Great Northern Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 9) on 8 August 1928, replacing the Great Northern Road and running from North Sydney via Hornsby, Peat&#x27;s Ferry, Gosford, Swansea, Newcastle, Maitland, Singleton, Tamworth, Armidale, Glen Innes, Tenterfield and Woodenbong to the border with Queensland; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 9 on 8 April 1929.

The section of Great Northern Highway between Sydney and Hexham was subsumed into Pacific Highway on 26 May 1931; the southern end of Great Northern Highway was truncated at the intersection with Pacific Highway at Hexham as a result. The remaining portion from Hexham to Brisbane was later renamed New England Highway, through Queensland on 14 February 1933, and a month later through New South Wales on 14 March 1933. In 1936 the road was described by contemporary observers as being in good condition (for the time), with spectacular scenery and excellent accommodation en route.

Starting in 1946, the Queensland Main Roads Commission constructed the Cunningham Highway between Warwick and Ipswich. The new highway opened in November 1949. With the opening of the Cunningham Highway, traffic began using it as an alternative to the New England Highway north of Tenterfield. However, the road from the Bruxner Highway junction just north of Tenterfield across the state border to Warwick was still an unsealed local road. Despite this, in 1950 it was decided that the New England Highway would ultimately follow this route. Reconstruction and sealing of the route between Tenterfield and Warwick commenced in 1951, and the highway was officially opened on 11 August 1954. On 3 September, State Highway 9 was rerouted so that it now ran via Wallangarra and Stanthorpe, terminating at Warwick. At the same time, the old route of the New England Highway was redeclared as State Highway 24, the Mount Lindesay Highway. In 1963, the Queensland MRD reclassified much of their road network. As part of this, the New England Highway was extended north to its current terminus at Yarraman, via Clifton, Toowoomba and Hampton.

Route numbering:

The New England Highway was signed as National Route 15 from Warwick to Hexham in 1955. In 1974, the Whitlam government introduced the &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of Queensland and New South Wales, New England Highway was declared a National Highway in 1974 and was consequently re-signed as National Highway 15. At the same time, National Route 42 was signed, using the New England Highway from Warwick to Toowoomba. State Route 85 was allocated sometime during the 1980s between Toowoomba and Hampton, and State Route 61 allocated sometime during the 1990s between Hampton and its northern terminus at Yarraman. National Highway 15 was later truncated at its southern end from Hexham to Beresfield in 1988, as the Mandalong–Freemans Waterhole stage of Sydney–Newcastle Freeway opened and National Highway 1 was rerouted via existing arterial routes to Beresfield, then along New England Highway to Hexham, before resuming its original route north along Pacific Highway.

With Queensland&#x27;s conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2005, the Toowoomba-Warwick section of National Route 42 and State Route 61 were removed and replaced by route A3, now running concurrent with State Route 85 between Hampton and Toowoomba. The Warwick-Wallangarra section remains signed as National Highway 15. New South Wales&#x27; conversion to the newer alphanumeric system occurred later in 2013, with National Highway 15 updated to route A15 from the state border at Wallangarra to Branxton, where the highway becomes the A43 for its final section to Hexham.

<doc id="613716" wikidata="Q659134" url="?curid=613716" title="AlltheWeb">
<text>AlltheWeb (sometimes referred to as FAST or FAST Search) was an Internet search engine that made its debut in mid-1999 and was closed in 2011. It grew out of &quot;FTP Search&quot;, Tor Egge&#x27;s doctorate thesis at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, which he started in 1994, which in turn resulted in the formation of Fast Search &amp; Transfer (FAST), established on July 16, 1997.

==Traits==
When AlltheWeb started in 1999, FAST aimed to provide their database to other search engines, major portals, ISPs and content sites. By August 2, 1999, the AlltheWeb database had grown to 200 million unique URLs. By June 2002, their crawler had indexed over 2 billion pages.

AlltheWeb claimed a few advantages over Google, such as a fresher database, more advanced search features, search clustering and a completely customizable look.

==Closure==
In February 2003, FAST&#x27;s web search division was bought by Overture for $70 million. In July 2003, Overture was acquired by Yahoo!, putting AlltheWeb under the ownership of Yahoo!. Shortly after Yahoo!&#x27;s acquisition, the AlltheWeb site started using Yahoo!&#x27;s database and some of the advanced functions were removed, such as FTP search and direct image search.

In May 2006, Yahoo! started testing live search results on AlltheWeb.

On April 4, 2011, AlltheWeb was shut down by Yahoo!.

<text>Roxburgh Park ( , also ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of the central business district, located within the City of Hume local government area. Roxburgh Park recorded a population of 24,129 at the 2021 census.

The suburb is bound by Craigieburn to the north, to the west by Aitken Boulevard skirting the Greenvale Reservoir, to the east by the Craigieburn railway line and to the south by Somerton Road.

==History==

Originally part of Somerton, Roxburgh Park gets its name from the property &quot;Roxburgh&quot;, which was named by local farmer Thomas Brunton in about 1885, after his house in Scotland. Prior to the construction of Roxburgh Park, the area was the subject of a design by architect Philip Treeby for a garden suburb called &quot;Hopetoun&quot; in 1889. Plans for the suburb included parks, schools, tennis courts and shops. The early 1890s economic depression prevented the construction of this design.

In January 1951 the Moonee Valley Racing Club bought the &quot;Roxburgh Park&quot; property for £35,000, as a speculative investment, although the purchase did give the club an option if it ever had to leave its somewhat cramped location in Moonee Ponds.

The Victorian Government&#x27;s Urban and Regional Land Corporation (later &quot;VicUrban&quot; and then &quot;Places Victoria&quot;) purchased land in the area in 1988 to plan and develop Roxburgh Park (not unlike the new towns in the green wedges of Britain). The suburb, which was originally going to be named &quot;Ruthvenfield&quot;, was to comprise 7000 house blocks for around 20,000 residents. Construction began in the early 1990s.

Recognition of Roxburgh Park was promoted in widely screened TV commercials throughout the mid-1990s, presenting Roxburgh Park&#x27;s avowed virtues as a planned community with a balance of residential and industrial land, along with public reserves (part of the Shankland Reserve is in the south of Roxburgh Park), community services and access to transport. The slogan for the campaign was &quot;Roxburgh Park – where dreams come true...&quot;

Developments over recent years include child care centres, a retirement village and an Islamic centre. The commercial hub of the suburb is on Somerton Road.

==Demographics==

The most common ancestries of residents in Roxburgh Park are Turkish 11.8%, Australian 11.5%, Iraqi 10.5%, Chaldean (Assyrian) 8.5%, English 7.8%.

Roxburgh Park has been described as one of Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;multicultural hot spots&quot;. Well-known figures in the immigrant community of the suburb include Alaa Elzokm, who was awarded an Order of Australia in the 2023 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours, &quot;For service to the Islamic community&quot;.

==Education==
* Roxburgh Park Primary School
* Roxburgh Rise Primary School

==Commercial==

Three large shopping centres are located within the suburb; on Somerton Road is the Roxburgh Park Shopping Centre, which features 70 specialist stores, on Pascoe Vale Road near the Roxburgh Park Hotel is the Roxburgh Plaza and Homemaker Centre. The smaller Roxburgh Homestead Shopping Centre lies close to the Roxburgh Homestead Primary School. On Fouz Street, near the Good Samaritan Catholic Primary School and along Donald Cameron Drive, is Roxy Central. Roxy Central was finalised and fully opened during 2021. It contains national brands such as FoodWorks and many different local small businesses.

==Sport==

<text>Somerton is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Somerton recorded a population of 6 at the 2021 census.

Somerton is predominantly an industrial and business suburb, and has a number of industrial parks, including the Austrak Business Park, Somerton Logistics Centre and the Northgate Distribution Centre. It is bounded by Patullos Lane in the north, the Merri Creek in the east, Somerton Road/Cooper Street in the south and the Craigieburn/North East railway lines in the west.

==History==

The origin of Somerton&#x27;s name is unclear, however records from 1847 show a &quot;Summerton Inn&quot;. It may have also been named after Somers Town in London, England.

Somerton Post Office first opened on 1 January 1854 and closed in 1864. It reopened in 1892, some time after the railway line opened and again closed in 1966. In 1994, the Somerton Business and Delivery Centre opened.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Two bus routes service Somerton:

* : Craigieburn station – Broadmeadows station via Upfield station. Operated by Broadmeadows Bus Service.
* SmartBus : Frankston station – Melbourne Airport. Operated by Kinetic Melbourne.

===Train===
Roxburgh Park station, on the Craigieburn line, and Upfield station, on the Upfield line, are the nearest railway stations to Somerton. Somerton railway station opened in 1881 and closed to passengers in 1960. A crossing loop on the Melbourne – Sydney standard gauge line and an adjacent rail yard retain the Somerton name.

<doc id="613730" wikidata="Q1544396" url="?curid=613730" title="Great Western Highway">
<text>Great Western Highway is a state highway in New South Wales, Australia. From east to west, the highway links Sydney with Bathurst, on the state&#x27;s Central Tablelands. The highway also has local road names between the Sydney city centre and Parramatta, being: [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]] from to , [[Parramatta Road]] from Chippendale to Parramatta, and Church Street through Parramatta. 

==Route==
The eastern terminus of Great Western Highway is at Railway Square, at the intersection of Broadway with Quay Street, in the inner-city suburb of Haymarket and just south of the Sydney CBD. From Railway Square, the highway follows Broadway south and west, to the intersection with City Road (Princes Highway), where the highway changes name to Parramatta Road and heads generally west towards Parramatta. Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) branches south-west at Summer Hill/Ashfield, and a short distance further west the majority of traffic is diverted off the highway onto M4 Western Motorway via the WestConnex tunnel at Ashfield. A short distance further west, on the northern fringes of Ashfield, the City West Link arterial road ends at a major junction with the highway at Frederick Street (which proceeds south to join Hume Highway).

The highway continues west as Parramatta Road, with a major intersection at Homebush West with the A3 arterial road. Although the A3 road is called &quot;Centenary Drive&quot; in this area, the on-/off-ramps are separately named Marlborough Road, carrying on the name of the surface road that was replaced by Centenary Drive. Further west, on the boundary between Lidcombe and Auburn, the highway intersects the A6 arterial road (St Hillier&#x27;s Road / Silverwater Road).

Just south of Parramatta, the highway meets Woodville Road and continues west onto an on-ramp for M4 Western Motorway, while the highway-designated route turns sharply to the north along Church Street, before turning west again at the southern fringe of the Parramatta central business district, continuing west across western metropolitan Sydney to , north of the central business district, where it crosses the Nepean River via the 1867 Victoria Bridge. At , M4 Western Motorway reconnects with the highway as it begins its ascent into the Blue Mountains. It intersects with Darling Causeway at Mount Victoria which heads north to connect with Bells Line of Road. From Mount Victoria, the highway descends via Victoria Pass into the Hartley Valley and then passes through the western suburbs of Lithgow where it is joined by the Chifley Road, which links eastward back to Bells Line of Road. The highway continues generally west, intersecting with Castlereagh Highway west of Marrangaroo, and crosses Coxs River to ascend the Great Dividing Range to reach its highest point (at just east of Yetholme) and over the western ridge of the Sydney basin before dropping into the Macquarie Valley to reach its western terminus at Bathurst, at the junction of the Mitchell and Mid-Western Highways.

At numerous points along its journey, the highway transverses or is transversed by the Main Western railway line. Major river crossings occur east of Emu Plains (Nepean), near Wallerawang (Coxs), and east of Bathurst (Macquarie).

It consists of two of Australia&#x27;s most historic roads – Parramatta Road, and the full length of the former Great Western Road, from Parramatta to Bathurst.

==History==

===Colonial establishment===

====Sydney CBD to Parramatta and Penrith====

Initial travel between Sydney and the settlement of Parramatta was by water along the Parramatta River. Sometime between 1789 and 1791 an overland track was made to provide an official land route between the two settlements. Parramatta Road dates to the 1792 formation of a route linking Sydney to the settlement of Parramatta, formalised under the direction of Surveyor-General Augustus Alt in 1797. Parramatta Road became one of the colony&#x27;s most important early roadways, and for many years remained one of Sydney&#x27;s premier thoroughfares. By 1810, Parramatta Road had officially open to traffic and was financed during a large portion of the 1800s by a toll, with toll booths located at what now is Sydney University and the Duck River.

From Parramatta to Penrith, a road along the current alignment of the Great Western Highway (except at and Penrith) was constructed soon after completion of the Sydney–Parramatta Road.

====Emu Plains to Mount Victoria====

In 1813, acting on the instructions of Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth led an 1813 expedition that travelled west from Emu Plains and, by staying to the ridges, were able to confirm the existence of a passable route directly west from Sydney across the Blue Mountains. The existence of other, less direct routes had been known as far back as 1797, but due to the need to prevent convicts from believing that escape from the hemmed-in Sydney region was possible, knowledge of the expeditions confirming the existence of routes across the Blue Mountains was suppressed. Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth travelled as far west as the point they named Mount Blaxland, southwest of where Lithgow now stands. From this point they were able to see that the worst of the almost impenetrable terrain of the Blue Mountains was behind them, and that there were easy routes available to reach the rolling countryside they could see off to the west.

====Mount Victoria to Bathurst====
Macquarie then despatched Surveyor George Evans to follow Blaxland, Lawson and Wentworth&#x27;s route and to push further west until he reached arable land. Evans travelled west until he reached the Fish River, and followed it downstream until he reached the site of Bathurst. Within a year, Macquarie commissioned William Cox to construct a road west from Emu Plains, following Evans&#x27; route, and this road was finished in 1815. Macquarie himself travelled across it soon after completion, established and named Bathurst, and named the road the Great Western Road.

The section of the Great Western Road as far west as , with a small number of minor deviations, is still in use today as part of the Great Western Highway. West of Mount Victoria, Evans&#x27; route has been superseded, chiefly by Mitchell&#x27;s new route constructed between 1832 and 1836.

===Route development===
Between present-day and Dog Trap Road (now Woodville Road), Parramatta Road travelled in a wide arc up to south of the present route, to avoid marshy areas around Haslams Creek and Duck River. Continuing due west from Flemington, it crossed Duck River near the present Mona Street bridge, turning north near the present Granville Park to finish at George Street in Parramatta, between Pitt and Church Streets. This was deviated circa 1840 to follow the present route. Few traces of the original route remain.

At Mount Victoria, at the western edge of the Blue Mountains, the route of Cox&#x27;s road turned north to Mount York, from where it descended into the Hartley Valley. This pass was the major piece of engineering on the original route, and when Macquarie travelled the new road in 1815, he named it Cox&#x27;s Pass in honour of the builder. From the foot of Mount York the road resumed its westerly direction to where now stands. However, from here it ran via the present-day Glenroy, Mount Blaxland, Cut Hill Road, Pitts Corner, Phils Falls, Mount Olive Road, Carlwood Road and Sidmouth Valley to a point south of . From here it continued westward, not crossing the Fish River, but crossing Campbells River north of the present bridge at The Lagoon and ascending to another ridgeline where it turned north to Gormans Hill, to reach the future site of Bathurst from the south, not the east.

For the first one hundred years after this ceased to be the route of the Great Western Road it remained trafficable, but the destruction of the bridge at Phil&#x27;s Falls on the Fish River in 1930 meant it was no longer a through route, and parts became untrafficable. However, most of this route remains in existence as a series of local roads.

The original route had only been in existence for eight years when, in 1823, Assistant Surveyor James McBrian identified an improved route on the approaches to Bathurst. This route turned north south of O&#x27;Connell to run northwest to where is now located, then west across the Macquarie River into Bathurst. The section from south of O&#x27;Connell to Kelso is now part of the Bathurst-Oberon Road, and from Kelso into central Bathurst still remains as part of Great Western Highway.

When Major Thomas Mitchell was appointed as Surveyor-General in 1828, one of the first matters to which he turned his attention was the improvement of the Great Western Road. Mitchell&#x27;s attention was focussed on providing a more direct and easily graded route for the Great Western Road. To this end, he surveyed a route running northwest from Hartley via Mt Walker to Meadow Flat, crossing the Great Dividing Range at Mount Lambie, then running in an almost straight line westward via Browns Hill to Kelso, to meet the pre-existing road. This road remains in existence – from Mount Lambie west it remains as the route of the current highway (with deviations) but the section adjacent to Cox&#x27;s River was inundated by the construction of Lake Lyell for Wallerawang Power Station in the late 1970s.

Mitchell was also concerned to improve the worst sections of the road, which were the climb from the Cumberland Plain, on which Sydney sits, and the descent of Mount York, down the western side of the Blue Mountains.

In improving the eastern ascent Mitchell adhered largely to Cox&#x27;s route, which follows the southern side of an east-falling gully to reach the plateau at where is now located. However, he engaged Scottish engineer David Lennox to build a stone arch bridge, now the Lennox Bridge, across the mouth of a particularly deep side gully. This route, known as Mitchell&#x27;s Pass, was completed in 1833 and superseded what is now called Old Bathurst Road, located to the north of the route. The Mitchell&#x27;s Pass and Lennox Bridge served as the main route to the Blue Mountains for 93 years until 1926, when the Great Western Highway was re-routed via sections of the former Lapstone Zig Zag including the Knapsack Viaduct.

After protracted arguments first with Governor Ralph Darling and then his successor Richard Bourke, and ignoring orders, Mitchell surveyed, designed and had built what is now known as Victoria Pass, where the highway drops from the Blue Mountains into the Hartley Valley. Midway down the road had to be supported on a causeway formed by massive stone buttressed walls, where a narrow ridge connects two large bluffs. This ridge had to be widened and raised to give the highway a route from the upper to the lower bluff. Mitchell cut terraces into the sides of these bluffs to form a passage for the road. It is a testimony of Mitchell&#x27;s vision and engineering skill that this route, almost unchanged, and using his 1832 stonework, is still in use. Because this pass brought the road into the Hartley Valley several kilometres south of the Mount York descent, it necessitated a new route as far west as Hartley to meet Cox&#x27;s Road. This also is still in use as part of the highway.

In 1929 the Main Roads Board deviated the route north from Old Bowenfels to Marrangaroo, using Trunk Road 55 (Mudgee Road, today Castlereagh Highway). From Marrangaroo a new road was built westward, running south of Wallerawang to meet Mitchell&#x27;s 1830 deviation immediately east of Mount Lambie. This route avoids the long, steep gradients either side of Cox&#x27;s River, which were the main drawback of Mitchell&#x27;s route.

Great Western Highway today therefore consists of Parramatta Road to Parramatta, the Great Western Road to Emu Plains, Coxs Road to Hartley (other than Mitchell&#x27;s deviations at and Mount York), Mitchell&#x27;s route from Hartley to Old Bowenfels, the Main Roads Board route from Old Bowenfels to Mount Lambie, Mitchell&#x27;s road from Mount Lambie to Kelso, and McBrian&#x27;s road from Kelso to central Bathurst.
===Road classification===
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Great Western Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 5) on 8 August 1928, from the interchange with Parramatta Road and City Road in the City of Sydney, via Penrith, Katoomba, and Lithgow to Bathurst; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 5 on 8 April 1929. Its eastern end was extended to the intersection of Broadway and Wattle Street on 22 February 1967 (part of Sydney&#x27;s Ring Road 1 at the time). It was extended east again to its current terminus at Railway Square in Haymarket on 22 January 1993.

As the main route for traffic from the Blue Mountains into Sydney was superseded from Great Western Highway to the Western Freeway/Motorway from the 1970s, the definition of Great Western Highway as State Highway 5 outside inner Sydney remained virtually untouched, until the western extension of Western Freeway from Emu Plains to Lapstone in June 1993, resulting in a roughly-2km gap between the beginning of the motorway and the interchange with Russell Street where the highway recommences.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Great Western Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 5, from the intersection of Broadway and Quay Streets at Railway Square in Haymarket to the interchange with M4 Western Motorway at Leonay, then from the end of Western Motorway at the interchange with Governors Drive at Lapstone to Bathurst.

==Improvements==
===During 19th century===
The first recorded major improvement to the route of Great Western Highway was the construction in 1806 of ten bridges along Parramatta Road.

In attempts to improve the gradient of the descent from the Blue Mountains plateau to the floor of the Hartley Valley, Lawson&#x27;s Long Alley was opened in 1824. This still did not prove satisfactory and construction of a second deviation, known as Lockyer&#x27;s Pass, was commenced. However this route was not completed, as its construction was abandoned in favour of construction of Mitchell&#x27;s route via Victoria Pass.

Originally the Great Western Road crossed the Nepean River at Penrith by means of a ferry adjacent to the Log Cabin Hotel. This was superseded in 1856 by a bridge which was destroyed by a flood in 1857. A second bridge was opened in 1860, and was destroyed by the record flood of 1867. In the same year a new bridge, Victoria Bridge, was nearing completion adjacent to the road crossing, as part of the Penrith-Weatherboard (Wentworth Falls) section of the Main Western Railway. Its deck was modified to accommodate road traffic as well as the single-track railway. This bridge continued in dual use until 1907 when the current steel truss railway bridge was built alongside, and the 1867 bridge was given over solely to road traffic. This bridge remains in use for Great Western Highway. The design of this bridge is almost identical to that of the 1863 Menangle Railway Bridge, also over the Nepean River.

In 1870 the Denison Bridge, a wrought iron truss bridge, was built across the Macquarie River at Bathurst. This replaced an earlier wooden bridge.

===During early 20th century===
In the first few years of the 20th century the railway overpasses between Lapstone Hill and Mount Victoria were replaced as part of the duplication of the Main Western railway. These bridges were of brick arch construction. They were in turn replaced in the mid-1950s to obtain the necessary height clearances for overhead wiring for the electrification of the Main Western Railway from Penrith to Bowenfels.

In 1912 Victoria Pass was superseded by Berghofers Pass, which followed a similar route to Victoria Pass, but below it. It was more winding and thus longer, thereby affording a less steep climb. However rapid improvements in motor vehicle performance meant that in 1920 Victoria Pass was rebuilt to become the main route again.

After the ascent of the eastern escarpment by the Main Western Railway was deviated for the second time in 1913 to its current route via Glenbrook Gorge, the Great Western Road was also deviated at this point for a second time in 1926 by the then Main Roads Board, which rerouted it via the disused 1867 stone arch railway viaduct across Knapsack Gully and around the southern side of Lapstone Hill to gain the first plateau in the ascent of the Blue Mountains. As this viaduct had held only a single railway track, its deck was widened in 1939 to its present two lane configuration. The viaduct was closed to motor traffic when the M4 Motorway was extended west from Russell Street to connect to the highway at Lapstone in 1994.

West of Knapsack Gully, although now widened to four lanes, the 1926 route of the highway is still in use. It uses a long stretch of abandoned railway formation – the section from Zig Zag Street to Blaxland station is located on the original 1867 railway alignment. An indication of the need to divert the railway can be gained from the gradient of the highway as it climbs west from Hare Street to Lovett Street.

A number of deviations were built in 1929:
* at Haslams Creek, , to straighten the road and provide a new bridge
* between and , to remove an underpass and an overpass of the railway from the route of the highway
* at Eusdale, Yetholme (in three sections) and Melrose (all west of Meadow Flat), to ease gradients.

In 1930 the level crossing at Bowenfels was replaced by an underpass.

Victoria Pass was upgraded in 1932 to give a constant width of 8.5 m, with a minor deviation built at the foot of the pass.

===Upgrading since World War II===
In 1957 a short deviation immediately west of Linden eliminated two narrow overpasses of the railway, both of which had right angle bend approaches from both directions. These bridges would have had to have been replaced in any event to allow for overhead wiring for the electrification to Bowenfels of the Main Western Railway. Such replacements occurred east of Linden, further west of Linden near Bull&#x27;s Camp, east of Lawson, at Medlow Bath and east of Mount Victoria, and in these cases the replacement bridges were located at a skew angle to eliminate right angle bend approaches, with the earlier bridges left for pedestrian use.

In 1958 the &#x27;Forty Bends’, where the Highway runs along the foot of Hassans Walls approaching Lithgow, were eased. The fact that this section of the highway is on the southern side of a very high escarpment poses severe ice problems during winter, due to the lack of sunlight.

In the early 1960s the highway was deviated east of Leura to cross under the railway at Scott Parade (which was itself part of the former highway route) and run along the north side of the railway to rejoin the previous route at Leura Mall.

In 1967, the highway was deviated to bypass Springwood shopping centre, eliminating two narrow underpasses of the railway from the highway route. The previous route remain in use for local traffic as Macquarie Road. In 1968 a dual carriageway 3 km deviation was opened at Prospect. This replaced the only winding section of the Highway between Parramatta and Penrith. The bypassed section was heritage-listed in 2014 as the best-preserved section of the 1818 alignment.

From the late 1960s to the early 1970s the highway was almost entirely realigned and constructed to three lanes, being deviated as necessary, between Kirkconnell and Glanmire. Ironically this included reinstatement of most of the parts of Major Mitchell&#x27;s 1830 alignment which had been deviated in 1929 to ease gradients.

This work was extended eastward to Mount Lambie in stages during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A second Cox&#x27;s River deviation, to replace the 1929 deviation, was completed in 1993, between Marrangaroo and Mount Lambie.

At Katoomba the highway was deviated in 1985 to travel along the eastern side of the railway station, whereas the original alignment crossed the railway via a level crossing at the north end of Katoomba Street and ran along the western side of the railway. Immediately west of where the highway now crosses the railway due to this deviation, the highway was realigned over a distance of 1 km in 2004 to remove the sharp bend at &#x27;Shell Corner&#x27;.

In Bathurst, the Denison Bridge (1870) was bypassed in 1991 by a realignment of the Highway where it crosses the Macquarie River into Bathurst city centre. Because of its heritage value it was retained for use by cyclists and pedestrians.

During 1991–1993 a massive cutting was made to improve and widen the alignment of the highway immediately east of Woodford. At the top of the southern side of this cutting can be seen the rudimentary excavation of the rock for Cox&#x27;s 1815 road. This was severed in 1868 by the construction of the Springwood-Mount Victoria section of the Main Western Railway. The railway itself was deviated at this point in the 1920s when it was duplicated, and a cutting on the original alignment of the railway now forms the top section of the southern face of the highway cutting, the terrace in the face of the cutting being the bed of the original cutting.

In June 1993 the highway route was severed at Emu Plains with the closure to road traffic of the Knapsack Gully Viaduct. This occurred in conjunction with the westward extension of the M4 Motorway from its terminus since 1971 at Russell Street, Emu Plains. This extension connects directly to the highway at Lapstone, bypassing the viaduct. The portion of Great Western Highway west from Russell Street to Mitchells Pass Road is now only used by local traffic to access residential properties. Mitchells Pass, travelling is now one way eastbound between Lennox Bridge and the highway, due to its narrowness. Great Western Highway traffic therefore has to use the M4 between Russell St and Governors Drive.

A major realignment west from Mount Boyce (the highest point on the highway) to eliminate the Soldiers Pinch and other nearby sharp curves was completed in 2002.

===Duplication and widening===
From Railway Square to Woodville Road, the highway was widened to its present width when it was reconstructed in reinforced concrete in the 1930s. From Woodville Road west to The Northern Road the highway was widened, generally progressively westward, from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. This section is a combination of six lanes with median strip, six lanes with wide landscaped median, and four lanes undivided. At The Northern Road in Kingswood the highway reverts to a four lane undivided configuration through Penrith shopping centre, widens to six lanes at the Castlereagh Road intersection, reverts to two lanes west from Castlereagh Road to Russell Street, and is then four lanes undivided with sealed shoulders from Russell Street to the base of Mitchells Pass, where it has been truncated.

Between 1981 and 2015 the NSW Government Roads &amp; Maritime Services duplicated the highway between and west of Katoomba, generally working westward. This work incorporated the dual carriageway Springwood bypass, opened in 1967.

West of Katoomba, there is a further of dual carriageway on the River Lett Hill, and of dual carriageway from Magpie Hollow Road at Old Bowenfels to Lidsdale State Forest. This was completed as follows:
* road widening and realignment completed in 2006
*River Lett Hill 2014/15
*Old Bowenfels to Bowenfels completed in sections during the late 1990s
*Bowenfels to Marrangaroo Creek mid-1970s
*Marrangaroo interchange with the Castlereagh Highway 1970
*Marrangaroo interchange to Lidsdale State Forest (second Cox&#x27;s River deviation) 1993.

Four-lane undivided sections are the of Victoria Pass (except for Mitchell&#x27;s 1832 causeway, which is two lanes), and from Boyd Street in to the terminus of the highway at its junction with the Mitchell and Mid Western Highways in West Bathurst (parts have a raised median strip).

From Lidsdale State Forest as far west as Glanmire most of the highway is three lanes, with almost continuous overtaking lanes alternating between eastbound and westbound.

===Controversy===
Many people, including Aboriginal communities, are complaining about the expansion works. The completed highway will destroy a lot of native lands. There are also fears that the highway could wipe out platypus populations.

==Current projects==
* Repairs and enhancements from Victoria Pass to Lithgow. The bridge at Victoria Pass is being refurbished and kept as two lane (one each direction.)
* Forty Bends upgrade (from top of River Lett Hill to Magpie Hollow Road) – consists of extension of the length of three-lane pavement and measures to reduce the incidence of black ice in winter
* Duplication from Ashworth Drive to Stockland Drive Kelso (in Bathurst).

==Route numbers==
Current route numbering is extremely confusing, considering its numerous allocation history, as follows:
*City Road to Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) Ashfield – A22, following the introduction of the &#x27;Metroads&#x27; in the late 1990s. Before M5 East was opened in late 2001 it was Metroad 5. After 2001 it was State Route 31.
*Liverpool Road, Ashfield to Wattle Street, Haberfield – no route number since the diversion via Stage 3, City West Link on 2 June 2000.
*Wattle Street, Haberfield to M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield – A44, following the opening of M4 East in July 2019. Before this, it was part of the A4.
*M4 Western Motorway intersection at Strathfield to Russell Street, Emu Plains – A44.
*Russell Street-M4 at Lapstone (Knapsack Viaduct now closed) – no number.
*M4 at Lapstone to intersection of Mitchell and Mid-Western Highways in Bathurst (end of Great Western Highway) – A32.

Route A32 continues along Mitchell Highway as far as Nyngan, then follows Barrier Highway to , north of and northeast of Adelaide, connecting with Horrocks Highway. Mid-Western Highway is designated route A41 from Bathurst to Cowra, then route B64 from Cowra to , connecting with Cobb Highway.

===Route number changes===
Great Western Highway was allocated part of National Route 32 (Sydney-Adelaide via Dubbo and Broken Hill) in 1955, with the section from Hume Highway (Liverpool Road) in Summer Hill to Chippendale sharing a concurrency with National Route 31. As sections of Western Freeway opened between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s, National Route 32 was diverted off Great Western Highway and onto the freeway on the opening of each section: from 1974, sections of the highway formerly allocated National Route 32 were allocated State Route 44 instead. Metroad 4 replaced National Route 32 across the entire freeway from Emu Plains to North Strathfield - and Great Western Highway from North Strathfield to Chippendale - in 1992, and Metroad 5 replaced National Route 31 from Summer Hill to Chippendale, also in 1992: Great Western Highway switched between National Route 32 and State Route 44 at Emu Plains, and between State Route 44 and Metroad 4 at North Strathfield, and was also concurrent with Metroad 5 from Summer Hill to Chippendale. Metroad 4 was diverted along City Link West at Haberfield in 2000 and wasn&#x27;t replaced, while Metroad 5 was diverted along the M5 East Motorway when it opened in 2001, and was replaced with State Route 31, leaving a short gap between Haberfield and Summer Hill that even today remains unallocated.

With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, State Route 44 was replaced with route A44, Metroad 4 was replaced with route A4, and State Route 31 was replaced with route A22. When M4 East opened between Strathfield and Haberfield in July 2019, route M4 was rerouted onto the new motorway. As a result, the section of Great Western Highway/Parramatta Road between Strathfield and Haberfield was designated A44, replacing the previous A4 designation.

<text>Svetlana Aleksandrovna Masterkova (; born 17 January 1968) is a Russian former middle-distance runner and former women&#x27;s world record holder for the mile and the current 1000 metres world record. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, she won the gold medal in both the 800 metres and 1500 metres.

==Career==
Born in Achinsk (Siberia), Masterkova started out as an 800 metres runner. She first appeared internationally at the 1985 European Athletics Junior Championships, taking 6th place in the 800 metres. Her breakthrough came in 1991, winning the national championships of the Soviet Union, which also qualified her for the World Championships. In Tokyo, she placed eighth in the final. During the following seasons, she had some minor successes (silver at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in 1993), but also suffered from injuries. In 1994 and 1995, she took a break from running, giving birth to a daughter (Anastasia).

In 1996, she returned to athletics. Instead of only running the 800 m, Masterkova also decided to compete in the 1500 metres, a distance she had not competed in four years. At the Russian Championships, she won both distances in top times. However, she was not considered as a real favourite for the 800 m Olympic gold; Maria Mutola and Ana Fidelia Quirot were expected to fight for the title in Atlanta. Masterkova took the lead from the start, and led the entire race to become Olympic champion. After this surprise, Masterkova caused a major upset by also winning the 1500 m in a similar fashion, thereby equaling Tatyana Kazankina&#x27;s performance at the 1976 Olympics (Kelly Holmes would repeat the performance in 2004). She completed her season by also setting two new world records at the 1000 metre and mile distances.

Masterkova was not able to repeat her feat at the World Championships the next year, as an achilles tendon injury caused her to drop out in the heats of the 1500 metres. Her 1998 season was great again, crowned by a win in the 1500 m at the European Championships. At the 1999 World championships, Masterkova again contested both middle distance events. She won bronze in the 800 m won by Ludmila Formanová but comprehensively won the 1500 metres title. This would be her last major success. Although Masterkova participated in the Sydney Olympics, she abandoned her 1500 metres heat. She announced her retirement at Znamensky Indoor stadium on 7 January 2003.

==Personal life==
Svetlana married Russian professional road racing cyclist Asiat Saitov in 1994. Their daughter Anastasiya Saitova is a professional tennis player, taking her first singles title in Sharm El Sheikh and ranked number 511 in the world in 2014.

<text>Ahmet Mesut Yılmaz () (6 November 1947 – 30 October 2020) was a Turkish politician. He was the leader of the Motherland Party (, ANAP) from 1991 to 2002, and served three times as Prime Minister of Turkey. His first two prime-ministerial terms lasted just months (in 1991 and 1996), while the third ran from June 1997 to January 1999. The first was brought to an end by defeat in the 1991 elections, the latter two by the breakdown of Yılmaz&#x27; coalition governments.

== Career ==
Of Hamsheni origin, Mesut Yılmaz was a rising star in the Motherland Party of Turgut Özal, representing the Black Sea province of Rize in the parliament and serving in Özal&#x27;s cabinet. He was State Minister for Information (December 1983), then Minister of Culture and Tourism (1986), and Minister of Foreign Affairs (December 1987 to February 1990). Upon Özal&#x27;s election to the presidency in 1989, Yılmaz became the leader of an intraparty opposition to the new prime minister, Yıldırım Akbulut.

== Prime minister ==

In June 1991, Yılmaz managed to discharge Yıldırım Akbulut from the party leadership and from all executive functions during the party congress. Because ANAP had the majority in the parliament he subsequently became Prime Minister of Turkey in the 48th government of Turkey. However, in October ANAP came in second in the 1991 general election to Süleyman Demirel&#x27;s True Path Party (DYP), and the DYP formed a coalition with the Social Democratic Populist Party (49th government of Turkey).

The following years saw a decline in the popularity of the Motherland Party and an acrimonious relationship with Tansu Çiller, leader of the center-right True Path Party (DYP). Yılmaz also made the Motherland Party more business-friendly and Europe-oriented, causing the more conservative, religious wing to switch to the Welfare Party (RP) of Necmettin Erbakan. In the December 1995 general election ANAP again came second, this time to the Welfare Party. After lengthy coalition negotiations Yılmaz formed a coalition with the DYP in March 1996 (53rd government of Turkey), but this lasted less than four months, falling to a censure motion led by the Welfare Party. President Demirel invited Erbakan to form a government, which he did, in coalition with the DYP.

Erbakan&#x27;s term was marked by the Susurluk scandal, during the investigation of which Yılmaz admitted the existence of the JİTEM counter-terrorist Gendarmerie unit. The scandal led to the resignation of Erbakan&#x27;s Interior Minister, Mehmet Ağar (a leader of the True Path Party, DYP), following revelations that Abdullah Çatlı, leader of the far-right Grey Wolves organisation, worked for the state. Yılmaz&#x27; concerns over his own safety, owing to his support of the Susurluk investigation, led to him briefly carrying a gun in self-defense.

Yılmaz formed a government for the third time in June 1997, after the Welfare Party had resigned from government following the February 1997 military memorandum. DYP and others expected to form a government under Tansu Çiller, but President Süleyman Demirel asked Yılmaz to form the new government. Yılmaz created an ANAP-Democratic Left Party-Democrat Turkey Party coalition which lasted until January 1999. Yılmaz&#x27; final term was marked by fallout from the investigations into the Susurluk scandal, and further revelations of connections between politicians, police and mafia. When the attempt to privatize the Türk Ticaret Bankası to Korkmaz Yiğit blew up in October 1998 over allegations of the involvement of mafia boss Alaattin Çakıcı, Yılmaz&#x27; coalition did not last much longer.

In October 1998, Yılmaz set off a furor in the Arab world by threatening to &quot;poke out the eyes&quot; of Syria over Hafez al-Assad&#x27;s alleged support of the separatist Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party.

== Later career ==

Yılmaz continued as a politician, however, serving as a deputy prime minister in a coalition led by Bülent Ecevit from 1999 to 2002. After his failure to win entry into the Grand National Assembly in 2002 elections, Yılmaz retired from politics to pursue a teaching career. A few days before the match between Fenerbahçe and Malatyaspor, the then-Prime Minister, Yılmaz, was a guest on a TV channel with Can Ataklı. During their conversation, Yılmaz made a statement: &quot;By Allah&#x27;s permission, we will make Galatasaray the champion this year too.&quot; Prior to the Malatyaspor match at Fenerbahçe&#x27;s closed stands, a huge banner was unfurled, reading &quot;We&#x27;ll see you at the ballot box, Mesut Bey.&quot;

He was charged by the state public prosecutor with corruption during his tenure as prime minister relating to the privatization of Turkish Trade Bank. In 2006, the Supreme Court suspended the case for five years, so that the charges would be dropped if no similar charges arose in that period. Yılmaz announced that he would return to politics.

In the 2007 general election, he was elected as independent member of parliament from Rize. He died from complications of lung cancer in 30 October 2020 and was buried at Kanlıca Cemetery two days later.

== Personal life ==

He was married to Berna Yılmaz. The couple became parents to two sons, Hasan Yılmaz and Yavuz Yılmaz, the latter of which was found shot dead in his apartment in Beykoz, Istanbul in December 2017. His son&#x27;s death was reported as a probable suicide by Turkish police. Mesut Yılmaz&#x27;s own licensed Smith &amp; Wesson gun was found beside his son&#x27;s body.

<doc id="613741" wikidata="Q354903" url="?curid=613741" title="Šuppiluliuma I">
<text>Šuppiluliuma I, also Suppiluliuma () or Suppiluliumas (died c. 1322 BC) () was an ancient Hittite king (r. –1322 BC).

Even before assuming the throne, Šuppiluliuma distinguished himself as a military commander protecting and reclaiming Hittite territories after a period of foreign attacks. Once king, he continued this program of consolidation and expansion, both in Anatolia and in Syria, with a great deal of success. Victories over a major rival, the Upper-Mesopotamian kingdom of Mittani, led to the extension of Hittite authority over a bevy of petty kingdoms in northern Syria, the installation of the Hittite king&#x27;s younger sons as local viceroys at Aleppo and Carchemish, and the rump of the Mittanian state itself became effectively a dependency of the Hittite Kingdom.

Relations with Egypt vacillated between friendship and hostility, culminating in the so-called Zannanza affair, in which Šuppiluliuma was persuaded to send one of his sons to marry the widowed queen of Egypt and assume its throne. The murder of the Hittite prince resulted in a long period of Hittite-Egyptian hostility, and Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s captives causing an outbreak of plague that ravaged Hittite society for at least two decades. For all his successes, Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s ruthlessness was blamed for this evil by his own son, Muršili II.

==Origins==
Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s origins are unclear. A statement in the genealogy of his grandson Ḫattušili III was long taken to indicate that Šuppiluliuma’s father and Ḫattušili III&#x27;s great-grandfather was Ḫattušili II. However, the terminology involved (which, taken literally, would indicate that Ḫattušili III was the great-grandson of Ḫattušili II) might have indicated more distant descent, and the Ḫattušili in question might have been the famous Ḫattušili I at the dawn of Hittite power in the late 17th century BC. The discovery of seal impressions naming Šuppiluliuma as the son of Tudḫaliya III (sometimes called II) led to the discarding of the previous hypothesis by most scholars. Most scholars now concluded that Šuppiluliuma was the son of his predecessor, Tudḫaliya III, whom he had long served as a military commander. However, the description of Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s first wife Ḫenti as the &quot;great queen, daughter of the great king, the hero,&quot; has resulted in her identification as the daughter of Tudḫaliya III, making Šuppiluliuma the son-in-law and possibly adopted son of that king.

==Generalship==

According to the &quot;Deeds of Šuppiluliuma&quot; composed by his son and second successor Muršili II, Šuppiluliuma served as the adviser and chief military commander to his predecessor Tudḫaliya III, helping effect the king&#x27;s recovery of his lands from Šamuḫa, where the court had established itself for greater security from enemy attack.

Tudḫaliya and Šuppiluliuma waged a successful campaign against the Kaška in the north, then intervened to recover control over and protect the regions of Kaššiya and the Ḫulana River Land to the west and southwest, striking back at their invaders. After dealing with a new threat from the Kaška under Piyapili, Tudḫaliya and Šuppiluliuma, had to fight King Karanni (or Lanni) of Azzi-Ḫayaša in the northeast. Karanni had invaded Hittite territory and even threatened Šamuḫa, but was defeated, Tudḫaliya and Šuppiluliuma invading Azzi-Ḫayaša in turn. A battle at Kummaḫa (probably Kemah) seems to have resulted in a Hittite victory, as Azzi-Ḫayaša is later found as a Hittite vassal.

After these successes in the north, Tudḫaliya seems to have been able to return to the Hittite capital, Ḫattuša. He sent Šuppiluliuma southwest against the Arzawa confederacy, and Šuppiluliuma was victorious in several battles, recovering the city of Tuwanuwa (probably Tyana), which had been occupied by the enemy.

The Hittite Kingdom had recovered much lost ground, but Arzawa remained a dangerous enemy, and Muršili II would relate that it took Šuppiluliuma some 20 years (presumably extending into his own reign) to settle affairs in the west. The recovery had clearly begun before the end of Tudḫaliya III’s reign, but credit for much of it was given to Šuppiluliuma.

==Accession to the throne==
When Tudḫaliya III died, the throne should have been inherited by his son Tudḫaliya the Younger, to whom Šuppiluliuma and other members of the Hittite elite had sworn oaths of loyalty. It is not clear whether or not Tudḫaliya the Younger actually ascended the throne, before he was murdered, together with some of his brothers, by the supporters of Šuppiluliuma. Long associated with Tudḫaliya as his chief military commander, Šuppiluliuma I now became king. The murder of Tudḫaliya the Younger was later identified by an oracle as a cause for the outbreak of plague that ravaged the Hittite kingdom for two decades, into the reign of Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s son and second successor Muršili II. In accordance with tradition, the widow of the preceding king, Dadu-Ḫeba, continued to enjoy the title of chief queen, Tawananna, until her death.

==Family==

=== Queen Ḫenti ===
Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s first wife was Ḫenti, apparently the daughter of Tudḫaliya III. After the death of her mother or stepmother Dadu-Ḫeba, Ḫenti became the Tawananna. She is believed to have been the mother of all of Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s &quot;legitimate&quot; sons: 
* Arnuwanda II, who was Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s designated heir (&quot;tuḫkanti&quot;) and eventual successor.
* Telipinu, who was appointed priest (and governor) of Kizzuwatna and later became vassal king of Aleppo in Syria.
* Piyaššili, also called Šarri-Kušuḫ, who became vassal king of Carchemish as master of the formerly Mittanian lands west of the Euphrates.
* Zannanza, who disappeared en route to Egypt to marry a widowed Egyptian queen, possibly Ankhesenamun.
* Muršili II, who became king of the Hittites after his older brother, Arnuwanda I.

Šuppiluliuma also had daughters, of whom Muwatti was married to Mašḫuiluwa, the king of Mira-Kuwaliya in Arzawa, while another daughter, name unknown, was married to Šattiwaza, the king of Mittani.

Additionally, Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s sister, name unknown, was married to Huqqana, the king of Azzi-Ḫayaša. Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s brother Zida (or Zidana) was appointed Commander of the Guard.

A badly damaged text from the reign of her son Muršili II implies that Ḫenti may have been banished by her husband to the land of Aḫḫiyawa. The motivation for this decision remains unclear. Suggested possibilities include the desirability of a marriage alliance with the Kassite king of Babylon, or conflict between Ḫenti and Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s new Babylonian wife after that marriage alliance was concluded.

=== Malnigal ===
Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s last queen was a Babylonian princess possibly named Malnigal, who apparently assumed the title of Tawananna in place of her original name. She was the daughter of a Babylonian king, probably Burna-Buriaš II. The Babylonian Tawananna would survive a decade into the reign of Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s son and second successor Muršili II, who would demote and banish her after an oracle confirmed that she was guilty of causing the death of the king&#x27;s wife Gaššulawiya.

==Reign==

=== Anatolia ===
Šuppiluliuma continued his efforts to establish a Hittite supremacy in western Anatolia, providing asylum to the expelled heir to the throne of Mira-Kuwaliya, Mašḫuiluwa. Having married his daughter Muwatti to Mašḫuiluwa, Šuppiluliuma proceeded to make his new son-in-law the vassal king of Mira-Kuwaliya. When the young Manapa-Tarḫunta of the Šeḫa River Land was expelled by his brothers and fled to Karkiša, Šuppiluliuma ensured his safety by sending presents to the ruler of Karkiša and the exile was eventually restored to his throne by Šuppiluliuma’s son Muršili II. The defeat of the Hittite commander Ḫimuili by the Arzawan leader Anzapaḫḫaddu, who had refused the demands to release Hittite captives, forced Šuppiluliuma to intervene personally and enforce the demands. Šuppiluliuma established his lieutenant Ḫanutti as governor of the region, and the latter secured the submission of Lalanda and the pillage of Ḫapalla.

At some point late in his reign, perhaps not long before the Zannanza Affair, Šuppiluliuma waged a war against the Kaška in the north, temporarily subjugating and pacifying a portion of their land and establishing Hittite outposts there. This was followed by a Kaška revolt, in which many Hittites were slain and the Hittite fortresses came under attack. Šuppiluliuma and two of his generals struck back, invading and pillaging enemy territory, and restoring Hittite control over the northwestern land of Tummana (classical Domanitis?). The northern front remained unstable, and at the very end of his reign Šuppiluliuma is found campaigning against the Kaška again. He met with ostensible success, but it was impossible to consolidate these gains.

Apparently seeking to secure his northeastern frontier before pursuing his ambitions to the southeast, Šuppiluliuma arranged a marriage between his sister and Huqqana, supposedly making the latter king of his homeland, Azzi-Ḫayaša. In addition to the usual content of such treaties with vassal kings, this one featured extensive morality clauses. This treaty was probably concluded early in Šuppiluliuma’s reign.

=== Syria and Mesopotamia ===
Apart from consolidating his position in the northeast and west, Šuppiluliuma sought to recover control over Kizzuwatna and Tegarama, areas to the south and east, which had come under the indirect control of the Kingdom of Mittani centered on Upper Mesopotamia. An initial Hittite strike against Mittani failed, its king Tušratta claiming victory in a letter sent to Amenhotep III of Egypt, along with a representative share of the booty. Learning from his failure, Šuppiluliuma apparently made an alliance with a rival Mittanian royal, Artatama II and may have sought to keep Egypt, at this point a Mittanian ally, out of any following conflict by maintaining friendly diplomatic relations with it. Šuppiluliuma also established an alliance with Kassite Babylonia, and at some point married a Babylonian princess, his last queen.

==== One-Year War ====

Apparently after lengthy preparations, Šuppiluliuma attacked Mittani again in the so-called One-Year War. Responding to an appeal for help against Mittani from a petty king of Nuḫašši, Šarrupši, Šuppiluliuma launched a direct assault on Mittani, overrunning its vassal Išuwa, before capturing and plundering the Mittanian capital Waššukanni. Tušratta, unable to resist, fled to rally elsewhere. At this point, Šuppiluliuma created a certain Antaratli the vassal king of Alši in the northernmost part of Mesopotamia.

Šuppiluliuma then crossed the Euphrates into Syria, conquering the smaller kingdoms that had recognized Mittanian suzerainty there, including Aleppo, Mukiš (centered on Alalaḫ), Niya, Araḫtu, Qatna, and Nuḫašši. Carchemish, however, remained firmly under Mittanian control. Šuppiluliuma enticed the small but wealthy kingdom of Ugarit, which had loose ties to Egypt, into becoming an ally through common hostility to Mukiš and Nuḫašši, King Niqmaddu II of Ugarit eventually recognizing Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s suzerainty; having conquered these, Šuppiluliuma rewarded Ugarit with some of their lands. Šarrupši of Nuḫašši, who had betrayed his Hittite alliance, was driven from his throne, but later his grandson Tette was installed as a vassal king by Šuppiluliuma.

Although he had intended to bypass Kadesh, an Egyptian dependency, Šuppiluliuma was provoked into battle by its king Šutatarra. The Hittites were victorious, and the king and his family were carried off into captivity. Later, Šuppiluliuma allowed the return of Šutatarra’s son Aitakkama to rule Kadesh as a Hittite vassal. For the time being, Egypt apparently did not respond to the provocation (Šuppiluliuma would later claim that he took Kadesh from Mittani), and Šuppiluliuma could take great satisfaction in all he had achieved in single year of war.

==== Six-Year War ====
Late in his reign, Šuppiluliuma sought to consolidate his gains and expand farther at the expense of Mittani or eliminate it altogether, as Tušratta was defeated but unconquered. This led to the so-called Six-Year War. It was conducted mostly by Šuppiluluma&#x27;s deputies, especially his son Telipinu, the priest of Kizzuwatna, who had been made vassal king of Aleppo by his father. Telipinu succeeded in defeating an attack launched across the Euphrates by the Mittanians. However, while Telipinu was recalled for a meeting with his father at Uda (probably Hydē), the Mittanians renewed their attack, while an Egyptian force attacked the Hittite dependency of Kadesh. Sending his eldest son Arnuwanda and his Commander of the Guard Zida ahead, Šuppiluliuma gathered additional forces and headed to Syria. Meeting with success, he besieged of Carchemish and finally captured it, installing his son Piyaššili, also known as Šarri-Kušuḫ as its vassal king. The murder of Tušratta by one of his younger sons led to further conflict within Mittani, allowing the Hittites to consolidate their gains in Syria and on the Euphrates.

The weakening of Mittani was quickly exploited by its former vassals, Assyria and Alši, while Tušratta’s son Šattiwaza aimed to recover his father&#x27;s throne from Artatama II and the latter&#x27;s son Šuttarna III. Šattiwaza was forced to seek refuge first in Kassite Babylonia, then with his father&#x27;s former enemy Šuppiluliuma in Ḫatti. Šuppiluliuma married one of his daughters to Šattiwaza, bound him with an oath, and dispatched him to recover his father&#x27;s kingdom with the help of a Hittite army led by Piyaššili (Šarri-Kušuḫ). The treaty concluded between Šuppiluliuma and Šattiwaza reads, in part:
: Šuttarna, together with the chariot warriors, sought to kill Prince Šattiwaza. However, he escaped and came into the presence of My Majesty, Šuppiluliuma, King of Ḫatti, Hero, Beloved of the Storm-god. I, Geat King, spoke thus: &quot;The Storm-god has decided his legal case. As I have taken up Šattiwaza, son of King Tušratta, in my hand, I will seat him upon the throne of his father, so that the land of Mittani, the great land, does not go to ruin. I, Great King, King of Ḫatti, have given life to the land of Mittani for the sake of my daughter. I took up Šattiwaza, son of Tušratta, in my hand, and I gave him a daughter in marriage.&quot;

Šattiwaza and Piyaššili were successful, and Šattiwaza was established as king of what was left of Mittani (which was called Ḫanigalbat by the Assyrians). Although it was meant to be a great kingdom, the country was effectively reduced to becoming alternately the dependency of the Hittites and the Assyrians, until its final annexation by the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I (1265–1235 BC). Much of Mittani&#x27;s earlier territory, and that of its dependencies, was now reorganized under Hittite control, such as the vassal kingdom of Aštata, centered on Emar. The Hittite vassals in Syria were left under the management of the Hittite princes ruling at Carchemish and Aleppo, who served effectively as the viceroys of the Hittite great king in the area.

=== Relations with Egypt ===
After the earlier amicable relations with Egypt, conflict eventually ensued over the petty kingdom of Amurru. Supported by troops from nomadic bands (Ḫabiru), its king ʿAbdi-Aširta had preyed upon his neighbors until finally being captured by a belated Egyptian military action. His son Aziru renewed the depredations on his neighbors, while protesting his innocence to their common overlord, the king of Egypt, whom he solicited for chariots and troops against possible Hittite aggression. Aziru was summoned to and detained in Egypt, until released to deal with Hittite incursions in the area. After briefly staying loyal to Egypt, Aziru built up alliances with the Hittite vassals Niqmaddu II of Ugarit and Aitakkama of Kadesh, and finally openly defied Egypt and became a vassal of Šuppiluliuma. The new Hittite vassals preyed upon the neighboring dependencies of Egypt even more eagerly than before.

The Egyptian attack on Kadesh during the absence of Šuppiluliuma and Telipinu from Syria appears to have been an attempt to redress or avenge the Hittite advance into the Egyptian sphere of influence. When Šuppiliuliuma returned to Syria to besiege Carchemish, he dispatched two of his generals to raid and pillage the Egyptian dependency Amka in the region of Damascus in retribution.

==== Zannanza affair ====
Still at the siege of Carchemish and expecting another Egyptian attack in response, Šuppiluliuma was surprised to receive an unusual marriage proposal instead. It came from an envoy of a sonless Egyptian queen designated in the Hittite sources Daḫamunzu (a rendition of Egyptian &quot;tȝ-ḥmt-nsw&quot;, &quot;the king’s wife&quot;), who was the widow of a king called Nipḫururia (a rendition of the throne name of either Akhenaten, Neferkheprure, or Tutankhamun, Nebkheprure). Although there is plenty of debate over which pharaoh&#x27;s widow was involved, most scholars tend to identify her as Ankhesenamun, the widow and possibly sister of Tutankhamun. This identification is assumed to be correct in the treatment below; the leading alternative for the widowed queen is Akhenaten&#x27;s widow Nefernefruaten-Nefertiti, who reigned as queen regnant after her husband&#x27;s death.

Having no sons and unwilling to take one of her subjects as husband (the most prominent options might have been Ay and Horemheb, both of whom became kings subsequently), the widowed queen, here assumed to be Ankhesenamun, asked the Hittite great king Šuppiluliuma to send one of his sons to Egypt to become her husband and king. The relevant exchanges are recorded in the &quot;Deeds of Šuppiluliuma&quot;, composed by Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s son and second successor, Muršili II. Ankhesenamun initiated the exchange by sending a letter expressing her distress and making her request:
My husband has died and I have no son. They say about you that you have many sons. You might give me one of your sons to become my husband. I would not wish to take one of my subjects as a husband... I am afraid.

Upon hearing Ankhesenamun&#x27;s request, Šuppiluliuma exclaimed:
Nothing like this has happened to me in my entire life!... Go and bring thou the true word back to me! Maybe they deceive me! Maybe in fact they do have a son of their lord!

Šuppiluliuma consulted with his council and dispatched his chamberlain Ḫattuša-ziti to Egypt to ascertain the facts. Upon realizing Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s wariness of her intentions, Ankhesenamun replied, by way of Ḫattuša-ziti and an Egyptian envoy named Ḫani:
Why didst thou say &quot;they deceive me&quot; in that way? Had I a son, would I have written about my own and my country&#x27;s shame to a foreign land? Thou didst not believe me and hast even spoke thus to me! He who was my husband has died. A son I have not! Never shall I take a servant of mine and make him my husband! I have written to no other country, only to thee have I written! They say thy sons are many: so give me one son of thine! To me he will be husband, but to Egypt he will be king.

After Šuppiluliuma heard Ankhesenamun&#x27;s angry response, he remained skeptical and wary. He expressed this to the Egyptian envoy Ḫani, accusing Ankhesenamun of having ulterior motives:
...You keep asking me for a son of mine as if it were my duty. He will in some way become a hostage, but king you will not make him!

After further assurances from the Egyptian envoy Ḫani, Šuppiluliuma eventually agreed to Ankhesenamun&#x27;s proposal. He selected his son Zannanza as Ankhesenamun&#x27;s husband and Egypt&#x27;s would-be king, and Zannanza was duly sent off to Egypt. According to Muršili II, Šuppiluliuma eventually learned that his son had been killed en route to Egypt: 
They brought this tablet, they spoke thus: &quot;... killed Zannanza,&quot; and brought word: &quot;Zannanza died.&quot; And when my father heard of the slaying of Zannanza, he began to lament for Zannanza.

While the text is broken where it would have indicated the murderers of Zannanza, Šuppiluliuma clearly considered the Egyptians responsible, addressing the gods: 
Oh gods! I did no evil, yet the people of Egypt did this to me, and they also attacked the frontier of my country.

Assuming that Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s prospective daughter-in-law was indeed Tutankhamun&#x27;s widow Ankhesenamun, suspicion might naturally attach to Tutankhamun&#x27;s successor, Ay, who seems to have ascended the Egyptian throne before the completion of negotiations between Šuppiluliuma and Ḫani, unbeknownst to them, and likely would have been threatened by the appearance of the would-be king Zannanza on the scene. Anticipating retaliation from the Hittites, the new pharaoh apparently denied all responsibility for the murder in a conciliatory missive to Šuppiluliuma, but the Hittite king rejected his excuses and threatened war in a draft reply found at Ḫattuša. The very fragmentary and heavily restored text reads, in part:
But now you always write as king of Egypt... When I was asked to provide a son for a husband... I did not know. I was prepared to send my son for the kingship, but I did not know that you were already on the throne... Regarding your writing to me, saying: &quot;Your son died, but I did him no harm,&quot; that... you say every time... When the Queen of Egypt kept writing to me, you were not... But if you had taken the throne in the meantime, you could have sent my son home! ... your servant Ḫani held us responsible... What have you done with my son? ... Then perhaps you have killed my son! You continually praise your troops and charioteers, but I will mobilize my troops and charioteers, whatever army I have. For me the Stormgod, my Lord, is the king of all lands, and the Sungoddess of Arinna, my Mistress, the queen of all lands. They will come and the Storm God, my Lord, and the Sungoddess of Arinna, my Mistress, will pass judgement!

Adding to Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s fury, the Egyptian messenger, Ḫani, had apparently attempted to deflect some of the responsibility for Zannanza&#x27;s death, perhaps pointing to the previous Hittite attacks on Egyptian territory. Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s draft letter addresses the new pharaoh&#x27;s attempts to intimidate the Hittites away from a military response:
Regarding your writing to me: &quot;If you lust for vengeance, I shall take away that lust for vengeance from you!&quot; But it is not me from whom you must take away that lust for revenge, you must take it from the Stormgod, my Lord! ... Those who denied him (Zannanza) the rule, they should ... Regarding your writing to me: &quot;If you write to me in brotherhood, then I will make friendship with you,&quot; ... why should I write about brotherhood?

The &quot;Plague Prayers&quot; of Muršili II complete the story:
: And although the Hittites and the Egyptians had been put under the oath by the Storm-god of Ḫatti, the Hittites came to repudiate (the agreement), and suddenly the Hittites transgressed the oath. My father sent infantry an chariotry, and they attacked the border region of Egyptian territory in the land of Amka. He sent (them) again, and they attacked again. When the Egyptians became frightened, they came and actually asked my father for his son for kingship. When my father gave them his son, and when they took him off, they killed him. My father became hostile, went to Egyptian territory, and attacked Egyptian territory. He killed the infantry and chariotry of Egypt.
: And at that time the Storm-god of Ḫatti, my Lord, gave my father the upper hand in the lawsuit (manifest in the armed conflict), so that he defeated the infantry and chariotry of Egypt. He killed them. When prisoners of war who had been captured were brought back to Ḫatti, the plague broke out among the prisoners of war and they [began] to die in great numbers. When the prisoners of war were carried off to Ḫatti, the prisoners of war introduced the plague into Ḫatti, and from that time people have been dying in Ḫatti. When I found the tablet mentioned earlier dealing with Egypt, I made an oracular inquiry of a god about it: &quot;Has this matter discussed earlier been brought about the Storm-god of Ḫatti because the Egyptians and the Hittites had been put under oath by the Storm-god of Ḫatti?&quot;

Thus, along with Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s murder of Tudḫaliya the Younger and other sins, Muršili II determined that Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s attacks on Egypt, despite the belief that the Egyptians had murdered Zannanza, were a cause for the outbreak of the plague (rabbit fever?) in the Hittite Kingdom. The plague is often considered the cause of death of Šuppiluliuma and of his eldest son and initial successor, Arnuwanda I.


==In fiction==
Šuppiluliuma I appears in Mika Waltari&#x27;s historical novel &quot;The Egyptian&quot;, in which he is presented as the ultimate villain, a ruthless conqueror and utterly tyrannical ruler. Popular culture researcher Abe Brown notes that &quot;As Waltari&#x27;s book was written during the Second World War, Šuppiluliuma&#x27;s depiction is likely to be at least in part inspired by Hitler, rather than by historical facts. Unlike quite a few other historical figures of many times and places who got cast in the role of Hitler, Šuppiluliuma has not yet attracted the attention of any historical novelist to write a bit more nuanced popular account—though his life certainly offers rich untapped material&quot;.

Janet Morris wrote a detailed biographical novel, &quot;I, the Sun&quot;, whose subject was Šuppiluliuma I, in which all characters are from the historical record, about which O.M. Gurney, Hittite scholar and author of &quot;The Hittites&quot;, commented that &quot;the author is familiar with every aspect of Hittite culture&quot;.

Šuppiluliuma appears in a minor role in the novel &quot;The Shadow Prince&quot; by Philip Armstrong, as the grandfather of the hero, Tupiluliuma, in which he is Tudḫaliya&#x27;s nephew and adopted son. It is explained that he was reluctantly forced to take the throne and exclude his adoptive brother, Tudḫaliya the Younger, as a result of his predecessor&#x27;s descent into madness. He is regarded as one of the greatest of the Great Kings of Hatti, but is not a man to be crossed lightly.

Šuppiluliuma is a character in the historical fiction manga &quot;Red River&quot;, introduced as an old man who has retired from warfare. He dies shortly after the start of the story.

Šuppiluliuma may be depicted in the &#x27;Nantucket&#x27; novels of S.M. Stirling, but under an alternative name, with a son called Kalkash.

Šuppiluliuma is a character in Turkish author Hüseyin Nihal Atsız&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Dalkavuklar Gecesi&quot; (The Night of the Sycophants), set in the Hittite kingdom.

<text>The Macquarie Place Park, also known as the Macquarie Place Precinct, is a heritage-listed small triangular urban park located in the Sydney central business district in the City of Sydney local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The former town square and milestone and now memorial, public park and monument is situated on the corner of Bridge Street and Loftus Street. It is named in honour of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. The precinct includes The Obelisk or Macquarie Obelisk, the Sirius anchor and gun/cannon, the Statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, the historic Underground Public Conveniences and the Christie Wright Memorial Fountain. The property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010.

Macquarie Place was the first formally laid out public space in Sydney in 1810, functioning as the town square. Along with Hyde Park, it is the oldest public park in Australia. Its size has been greatly reduced since colonial days. An obelisk from 1818 and designed by the New South Wales Government Architect, Francis Greenway, is located in the park and records the distance to various locations in New South Wales along the earliest roads developed in the colony. Later an anchor from the Norfolk Island wreckage of the First Fleet flagship, HMS &quot;Sirius&quot;, together with a cannon from the ship, were placed in the park. The Great North Walk to Newcastle southern terminus is at the obelisk in Macquarie Place.

Many important institutions have had establishments at Macquarie Place. In 1817 Australia&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of New South Wales opened in Macquarie Place. The State Library of New South Wales briefly had premises in the place during the 1830s. Opposite the place in Bridge Street is the original Department of Lands building, which was the department responsible for surveying and mapping New South Wales.

In 1883, a statue of early Australian industrialist Thomas Mort was unveiled in the park. In 1954, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh marked the beginning of the Remembrance Driveway by planting two plane trees in Macquarie Place.

== History ==
Originally swampy mangrove land on the banks of the Tank Stream, the colony&#x27;s first water supply, this site is very significant. In 1792 a path continuing Bridge Street and the carriageway to First Government House met in this approximate spot. This was then close to the foreshore. By then the alignment of lots forming its southern boundary was in existence.

Macquarie Place is shown from 1792 as a triangular area adjoining the garden of the First Government House, near the original foreshore of Circular Quay (then Sydney Cove) and on the eastern bank of the Tank Stream (when it was an open stream into Sydney Cove). The land of Macquarie Place is represented as such in the 1792 Governor Phillip&#x27;s Survey of the settlement in New South Wales and the 1793 Sketch of Sydney by Ferdinand Brambila. The triangular shape responded to the natural topography of the original shoreline of Sydney Cove and the Tank Stream. The triangular area was formed by the intersection of three early Colonial roads running in direct lines between three important constructions of the colonial period, including the Guard House at the entrance to First Government House at the south-eastern tip of the triangle, the bridge over the Tank Stream at the south-western tip of the triangle, and the 1788 fortifications (replaced by the Dry Store in 1791) beside the Government Wharf at the northern tip of the triangle. Macquarie Place may have operated as a public place of gathering for the early settlement from as early as 1791 alongside the Dry Store, located in the approximate present-day location of Customs House. At least half of the population still depended upon this Dry Store for collecting their food rations by 1801. During this early period before the official gazettal of Macquarie Place, part of the land was leased to Shadrach Shaw. This early lease appears in plans of Sydney of 1800 and 1807 and in no other known plans before or following these years.

By 1807 a triangular layout had been formalised (relating to the existing layout of plots) and a guard house had been built next to Government House&#x27;s main entrance.

===Macquarie&#x27;s plan for Sydney town===
In 1810 Macquarie named the principal roads in Sydney town, envisaging a regular grid, and set aside Macquarie Place as public ground. Roads to Liverpool and Windsor were completed and toll gates built. During his term (1810–1821) a network of surveyed new towns (the five Hawkesbury towns, Liverpool, Campbelltown) and roads pushed into the interior, well past the possible on his arrival. Bathurst Plains were opened up with a road across the Blue Mountains in 1814–1815. Elizabeth Macquarie advised her husband on creating public spaces – she knew about landscaping country estates – her involvement in creating the setting of her family home, Airds House, in Argyle, Scotland had impressed him. She and Francis Greenway had elaborate visions for Sydney. To achieve a picturesque setting, parks were created and buildings carefully designed and arranged to enhance the composition and create vistas. This form of landscaping was often used in English gentry country estates of the era.

Landscape gardening, in contrast to architecture, was an activity where it was then acceptable for women to participate. Elizabeth was responsible for introducing it into Australia. As the Governor&#x27;s wife she could and did influence the design of public and military buildings. The Macquaries transformed the Sydney and Parramatta Domains in picturesque style, sweeping away Phillip&#x27;s more utilitarian, straight lined beds and layout of paddocks.

Macquarie had unofficially employed convict architect, Francis Greenway from 1814, to inspect works and copy designs from Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s pattern books; appointing him Acting Government Architect and Assistant Surveyor in 1816. In that year Greenway prepared schemes including the First Government House and stables, Fort Macquarie and Dawes Point Barracks. With these he envisaged landscaped gardens. Of his vision for Sydney Cove only the stables (now Conservatorium) and this obelisk remain. Convict labour cleared and levelled the site.

The roughly triangular area bounded by the Government Domain to its east, the civil officers&#x27; houses to the south, the Tank Stream to the west and the houses of Messrs. Lord, Thompson and Reibey on its north was to be cleared of buildings and enclosures and made into an open area to be named &quot;Macquarie Place&quot;. There was no reference to access for the inhabitants of the town and its very naming implied possession. Although it was not enunciated in 1810, Macquarie&#x27;s immediate moves to replace the guard house to the west of First Government, to construct new residences for officials and to enclose Macquarie Place with a dwarf stone wall and paling in 1816, indicated that Macquarie Place was a triangular town &quot;square&quot; accessible only to the surrounding and sanctioned residents. The Obelisk constructed in 1817–1819 was primarily ornamental but given a more functional status, provided a decorative centre piece. The water fountain, demolished before it was completed in its first manifestation under Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s instructions and replaced with a structure to a design by Francis Greenway, stood at the south-west corner outside the Macquarie Place enclosure, providing a publicly-accessible water source as far removed from Government House as possible while providing a suitable ambience to the approach to First Government House from the town.

Macquarie Place was the first planned town square in Sydney, as well as the geographic centre of the early Colony, marked by the erection of the Obelisk at the centre of this park in 1818. Macquarie Place was the first formally laid out public space in Sydney and thus in Australia. Governor Macquarie was responsible for its formal layout, befitting its important situation at the centre of the colony. The park and the memorials standing in this park outline the development of Sydney since its foundation.

Macquarie Place separated the town from the Governor&#x27;s private domain, including the First Government House and its grounds extending into and including the present day Domain. Macquarie Place thus marked the boundary between the grounds of Government House and the surrounding residential allotments owned by the elite and leading Colonial officials of the early colony, including the Colonial Judge&#x27;s residence and offices, Colonial Secretary&#x27;s residence and offices, Simeon Lord, Andrew Thompson and Mary Reibey. The park containing the Obelisk formed the main town square of Sydney and both were popular subjects for many artists in the early days of the colony, including Conrad Martens, Joseph Fowles, Thomas Watling and Major James Taylor. This parcel of land was gazetted as Macquarie Place in 1810.

The western side of the reserve was available for private purchase, while the south side was occupied by Government buildings and the east by the Governor&#x27;s Domain. Significant emancipist traders such as Mary Reibey and Simeon Lord bought land on the west and Lord&#x27;s prominent three-storey mansion occupied the site of today&#x27;s (1931) Kyle House.

===Macquarie Place===

Macquarie Place is now the oldest town square in Australia. Together with Hyde Park, it is also the oldest urban park in Australia and has been in continuous operation as a public space for at least 195 years.

====The obelisk====
The Obelisk is the oldest surviving milestone built to mark the place from which all public roads in the Colony were to be measured, and is the second oldest known European monument in Australia. The oldest known monument is the 1811 obelisk also erected by Macquarie&#x27;s Regiment at Watsons Bay to commemorate the completion of construction of the road to South Head. An obelisk could be used to mark a point from which a view could be obtained and could form an element in a vista to draw the eye. It is assumed this one was designed not only to enhance the entrance to Government House but also the vistas from it and the Government Domain / Governor&#x27;s Pleasure Garden (to the east and south). The scale of Sydney has much changed but the obelisk was once clearly visible from the ridges above Sydney Cove, the front of Government House and the North Shore. The park in which it was built was divided into segments by paths leading to the sandstone obelisk. A low wall surrounded the reserve.

Obelisks originated as Egyptian sacred symbols to sun God, Heliopolis. Pairs flanked temple entrances. Many were transported to Rome by emperors and erected in public squares. Adding a cross on top turned them into Christian symbols. Renaissance designers used them singly to mark particular points, such as the Piazza in front of St. Peter&#x27;s, Rome. Gardens such as the Villa Lante, Bagnaia and Pitti Palace, Florence also used them. These inspired many English gentlemen on the &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, and were widely published, probably finding their way into private libraries such as those of Elizabeth Macquarie and Francis Greenway. She brought pattern books with her here. He had to sell his library to pay creditors and relied on memory, and her books. Lord Burlington erected an obelisk in the gardens of Chiswick House, London () and they became a very fashionable element, especially after one was erected, with pyramid, in Bath, by Richard (Beau) Nash (1734). Elizabeth Macquarie and Greenway may both have visited, or at least seen drawings of Bath.

The obelisk&#x27;s form seems to be directly influenced by Georgian examples rather than Egyptian: Greenway is reputed to have based his design on that of Nash in Bath. It is also possible the source of the Macquaries&#x27; fancy may have been the pair of obelisks in the Passeio Publico overlooking the harbour in Rio de Janeiro, which they visited in August 1809.

Governor Macquarie caused the sandstone Obelisk to be erected in the (then) centre of Macquarie Place in 1818 to mark the place from where all public roads were to be measured for the expansion of the colony into the interior on New South Wales. It was erected near the carriageway into the first Government House. &quot;New South Wales&quot; at the time was mapped as covering two-thirds of the continent, excluding only the territories now known as Western Australia. The distances and other Colonial centres inscribed on the Obelisk show the actual extent of the still tiny colony in 1818 despite its vast extent shown on maps at the time. Mileage is given only for Bathurst, Windsor, Parramatta, Liverpool, South Head and the North Head of Botany Bay. This was nevertheless the first major expansion of Sydney town into the interior of New South Wales, compared to when Macquarie first became Governor when he described the poor state of the colony, noting that the roads only penetrated forty miles into the interior. Built between 1816 and 1818, the obelisk before the Department of Lands building is literally the &quot;hub&quot; of NSW, the datum point from which all distances in NSW were measured from Sydney. Its inscriptions record the extent of the road network in 1818.

The Obelisk operated as the &quot;zero point&quot; for measuring the distance of roads from Sydney from 1818. It played a central role in the subsequent surveying, mapping and planned expansion of the Colony from the early 1800s beyond the current extent of New South Wales. Surveyors measured and laid out the line of many roads. Distances in the County of Cumberland were measured from this Obelisk. Those distances were also recorded at the side of the road on milestones or other distance markers. Road plans prepared by surveyors show these distances as well. Public works officers and workers were responsible for forming and making the roads, but it was the surveyors who laid them out, thus providing a direct link to the Macquarie Place Obelisk. The early surveyors of the Colony at the time of the erection of the Obelisk for this purpose included John Oxley, who was appointed by Governor Macquarie as Surveyor General in 1812, and James Meehan, who was appointed by Governor Macquarie as Deputy Surveyor General from 1812 to 1822.

Much of the time of John Oxley was devoted to journeys of exploration into the interior of the colony rather than in ordinary survey work. The duties of surveying land were largely performed by James Meehan, who produced the 1807 Plan of the Town of Sydney. In addition to his surveying duties, Meehan carried out considerable journeys of exploration, a matter largely ignored by his predecessors. As a result of the recommendations of Commissioner Bigge additional surveyors and draftsmen were appointed in an attempt to overcome the arrears of survey work in the colony. In very many instances land had been occupied without any proper survey having been carried out. T L Mitchell was the Surveyor-General from 1828 to 1855, and was also responsible in the early 1830s for road building. In that role, he laid out the main Northern, Southern and Western Roads, undertaking major works such as the Victoria Pass works at Mount Victoria. The distance of these roads laid out by T L Mitchell and other major nineteenth century roads for the expansion of the Colony were measured from the Obelisk. With few exceptions, roads emanating from Sydney, in particular the historic &quot;Great Roads&quot; continue to be measured from the Macquarie Obelisk. The RTA &quot;ROADLOC&quot; distance measurement system is also measured from this point.

The Obelisk was designed by Francis Greenway, one of the most celebrated architects of early NSW with strong influence from Elizabeth Macquarie, and was built by the stonemason Edward Cureton in 1818–20. It was one of the first works of the former convict, Francis Greenway, formed part of a group of civic adornments designed by Greenway, but was the only one built due to the intervention of Commissioner Bigge. Greenway is reputed to have based his design on the influential 1734 Georgian Obelisk erected by Richard (Beau) Nash in Bath, England, more so than the Egyptian prototypes. While the stone used to construct the Obelisk would have been quarried locally near Sydney Cove, the exact location of the quarry is not known. There are no other structures in Sydney that are built from this particular fine grained white sandstone. Unusually for obelisks, this needle was constructed of ashlar blocks of sandstone because, despite the availability of a convict labour force, the technology for excavating a single block of sandstone was not available in colonial Sydney at the time.

Macquarie Place and the Obelisk provide evidence of Governor Macquarie&#x27;s vision for the planning of the Colony and its future. This far exceeded the views of the British Government at the time which considered NSW to be a gaol outpost of the British Empire, and as such did not warrant the substantial public buildings, monuments and public investment by Macquarie. This was embodied in the reaction of Commissioner Bigge to the Obelisk when he travelled from England to investigate the Colonial management and convey this British view. Bigge found even this simple monument too grand for a penal settlement. Governor Macquarie defended with indignation the expense and design describing it as a &quot;little unadorned Obelisk... rendered at a trifling expense, somewhat ornamental to the Town...&quot; which did not, in his view, &quot;merit any censure&quot;.

The erection of features like the Obelisk that were completed before British criticism became too severe are also remnant evidence of the attempts by Governor Macquarie and his wife to construct Sydney City as a Georgian town with a regular planned layout and elegant buildings, set within picturesque landscaped grounds. The Hyde Park Barracks, St James Church and the First Government House stables (now the Conservatorium) are other rare surviving remnants of Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney. Macquarie Place and the Obelisk therefore provide a rare record of the transition of the early town from a rough penal settlement to a planned city under the direction of Governor Macquarie.

The Obelisk also demonstrated the potential for success in the Colony and the abundant opportunities even for ex-convicts like Francis Greenway. Francis Greenway was convicted of forgery in 1812 and sentenced to death. This sentence was commuted to transportation to New South Wales for 14 years. In 1816 Greenway was appointed by Governor Macquarie to the position of the first Colonial Architect and became one of the most important architects of the colonial period.

As the Colonial Architect from 1816, Greenway prepared elaborate schemes for Sydney Cove including a series of castellated buildings, Government House, Government House Stables, Fort Macquarie and the Dawes Point Barracks, plus landscaped gardens and an Egyptian styled monument on Garden Island. Only the Stables (now converted and altered for the Conservatorium of Music), St James Church, Hyde Park Barracks and the Obelisk remain of Greenway&#x27;s work on implementing Macquarie&#x27;s vision of the early 1800s for Sydney township.

====The Greenway fountain====
In 1819, Macquarie also commissioned Greenway to design the Doric fountain which was located at the western corner of the park in the location of the present statue of T. S. Mort. It was outside the fenced triangle so that the general public could have access and at the furthest point from Government House. Macquarie Place today is approximately half its original size. A path system was developed to encircle the park and these paths led to the central obelisk, as seen in &#x27;Harper&#x27;s Plan of Sydney, 1822&#x27;. The public were not allowed into the Governor&#x27;s Domain, however they were permitted to promenade in front of it, along the eastern foreshore of Sydney Cove. Macquarie Place separated the town from the Domain, it was the main square at the time and would have been the site for many events. The Inner Domain at the time included Bennelong Point and Sydney Cove down to Loftus Street and south to the intersection of Bent and Macquarie Streets.

Elizabeth Macquarie was influmental in the fountain&#x27;s design and construction, having a large section of its stonework pulled down and rebuilt after its niches were originally omitted. It was &quot;still unroofed&quot; in 1820. Controversy surrounded its erection: Bigge questioned both the contractor and Mrs Macquarie. She sent him haughty replies. Politicians hurled charges of extravagance at Macquarie, with such sarcastic phrases as &quot;temples round pumps&quot;. Macquarie defended it vigorously.

James Broadbent and Joan Kerr in a book &quot;Gothick Taste in the Colony of NSW&quot; noted:
During the Macquarie era the nature of Sydney changed and elegant structures often with associated courtyards or squares were built, e.g. the Military Barracks (demolished) and Hyde Park Barracks. Macquarie introduced building regulations though they were much ignored. Buildings like the obelisk show attempts to create a Georgian town with elegant buildings and regular layout. Macquarie resigned his post before Bigge arrived but remained in office until 1821.

===The &quot;Sirius&quot; anchor and cannon===
Macquarie Place also retains evidence of the first defences of the Colony taken from the warship of the First Fleet. The salvaged anchor and canon of the &quot;Sirius&quot; are still mounted in Macquarie Place. The &quot;Sirius&quot; was the man-of-war flagship which escorted the First Fleet to Australia. The &quot;Sirius&quot; sailed from England with the First Fleet on 13 May 1787, arrived in Botany Bay on 20 January 1788, and anchored at Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. The &quot;Sirius&quot; was wrecked on the coast of Norfolk Island in 1790. The &quot;Sirius&quot; cannon and anchor have been mounted at Macquarie Place for nearly a century or longer, according to different accounts. The iron cannon mounted at Macquarie Place was originally manufactured between 1767 and 1786 at the Calcutts Foundry in Shropshire, England, based on its marking with the cast founder&#x27;s mark of George Matthews from this foundry, and the Royal cipher of George III whose reign was from 1760 to 1820. The cannon was landed from the &quot;Sirius&quot; shortly after the foundation of the Colony, either in 1788 or 1796 as part of one of two groups of cannons taken from the vessel, and was used on shore for defences and signalling the arrival of vessels to the isolated community.

The first group of 10 iron six-pounder cannons (plus 2 brass six-pounders and 4 twelve-pounders) were offloaded from the &quot;Sirius&quot; in 1788 to defend the new Colony. The second group of 10 cannons was salvaged from the wreck of the Sirius in 1791–1796 under the direction of Governor Hunter when he was concerned for the security and defences of the Colony against a rebellion by Irish convicts and attack by the French or Spanish warships. Most historical records indicate that the subject cannon formed one of these 10 salvaged cannons.

The location of the subject cannon before 1810 is not known, although it is possible they formed part of the first fortifications at Dawes Point or Port Phillip (now Sydney Observatory) where the iron six-pounder cannons were placed in 1788, or later positions established by Governor Hunter and Governor King for the salvaged cannons at Bennelong Point, Garden Island, Windmill Hill, and unidentified positions described by Governor Hunter as &quot;the most commanding eminences which cover the town of Sydney&quot;. It is known that after 1810 the subject cannon was stationed at the Macquarie lighthouse at South Head as a signal gun by Governor Macquarie, together with three other salvaged cannons. The cannon was moved to Macquarie Place in the 1880s. In 1905 the anchor of the &quot;Sirius&quot; was salvaged from the wreck and mounted in this location with the cannon at Macquarie Place in 1907.

Macquarie Place and the surrounding area is also the site of the first constructed defences of Sydney Cove when the First Redoubt was built near its northern end as the first fortification of Sydney from 1788 to 1791. A redoubt is a temporary, stand-alone, fully enclosed fortification, generally constructed of earth walls. The 1788 redoubt at Sydney Cove was square in shape. Two cannons taken from the &quot;Sirius&quot; in 1788 were located at this Redoubt from 1788 to 1791, however, they were the two brass cannons, and therefore not the existing iron cannon. Macquarie Place took on its current size during the 1830s. During the 1830s, the relocation of Government House and extension of Castlereagh Street (now Loftus Street) through the original extent of Macquarie Place reduced the park to its present size from a public square to a small park, with the Obelisk situated near the boundary of Loftus Street.

The park around Macquarie Place was reduced between 1836 and 1843 and Loftus Street was created. This may have coincided with constructing Semi-Circular Quay, the Customs House and Alfred Street in the 1850s. Joseph Fowles in 1848 made drawings of Sydney&#x27;s highlights including this obelisk and fountain. Warehouses were built facing Loftus Street.

The park contains many mature trees with fig trees remnant of the street planting scheme of the 1860s.

Farrer Place dates to 1865 as, first Fountain Street (1871) (suggesting it led to the c. 1820 fountain), Raphael Street (1880) after a Councillor; Raphael Place and Raphael Triangle (1902+).

In 1935 the Minister for Agriculture requested that it and the triangular plantation space fronting the building housing the Department of Agriculture (the southern part of today&#x27;s Education Building) be renamed &quot;Farrer Place&quot;. This commemorated William Farrer (1845–1906) a noted wheat breeder whose work had incalculable benefit to the wheat industry, as he selected strains suitable for Australian conditions.

A Mayor of Sydney left his memorial with the 1869 stone gate posts facing Bridge Street marked with the words &quot;Walter Renny, Esq., Mayor 1869&quot;.

===Statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort===
In the 1880s large Government buildings (Lands; Education; Chief Secretary&#x27;s) were built along Bridge Street. Macquarie Place had become enclosed with a palisade fence. The fountain appears to have been demolished in c. 1887 to make way for the statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort.

The development of commerce and industry in Sydney is represented in Macquarie Place by an imposing bronze statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, who died in 1878. He was &quot;A pioneer of Australian resources, a founder of Australian industries, one who established our wool market&quot; states the inscription on the plinth. He was one of the first in Australia to make the export of perishable food possible by refrigeration, and to provide docks for the reception of the world&#x27;s shipping. Mort was also a major founder of the ship building and repair industry in Australia. His statue represents the evolution of a new Sydney – a city conscious of its dignity as the nucleus of a self-supporting and expanding colony within the Empire.

The statue was erected in this location in 1883. It replaced the earlier Doric Fountain of 1819–1820. Archaeological remains of the fountain may survive below ground beneath the footings of the statue. The Governor&#x27;s unveiling of the statue was witnessed by hundreds of workers who had voluntarily forfeited a day&#x27;s pay in order that they might be present for this final tribute to their late employer.

Mort (1816–1878) emigrated to NSW in 1838, setting up as an auctioneer in 1843, becoming an innovator in wool sales. His wealth facilitated his considerable horticultural ambitions, realised at Sydney&#x27;s then-finest garden, Greenoaks (now Bishopscourt), Darling Point, which set the tone for villas in this fashionable Sydney resort. He employed gardeners Michael Guilfoyle, Michael Bell and George Mortimore, creating a celebrated landscape garden. President of the NSW Horticultural Society in from 1862 to 1878, he maintained enthusiasm for horticulture over 30 years, first as an exhibitor and top prize winner in the Society&#x27;s shows, and later as an administrator. At Greenoaks he hosted some of the Society&#x27;s shows and grew an array of plants, including orchids and pursuing the hybridisation of cacti.

By the 1890s mature trees dominated: the obelisk was obscured. In c. 1917 a staircase on either side was built; Loftus Street was now higher. By the 1930s it was re-landscaped as an urban park flanked by warehouses and offices. Further schemes occurred in c. 1970 and c. 1980.

Around 1910 changes to the park included removal of an enclosing wrought iron fence and reduction in the number of fig trees from fifteen to four. During World War I the area around the obelisk was altered. The level of Loftus Street appears to have been raised at this time and a new staircase and retaining wall were built adjacent to the Obelisk. Gravel was installed between the outer fence and the Obelisk.

Two of the London Plane trees in Macquarie Place were planted in 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh, during the first visit to Australia by a reigning monarch. These trees commemorate the royal visit, mark the beginning of the Remembrance Driveway to Canberra, and recreate the site&#x27;s original function of being the starting point for main roads from Sydney.

Further 19th and early 20th century public memorials of exceptional quality and design which were relocated or erected in the park included an 1857 drinking fountain (relocated to this position in the 1970s) and the 1908 domed lavatory (now partly an archaeological site).

===Fountain and pond by Gerald Lewers===
In 1960, a small bronze fountain was added to the park designed by the renowned sculptor Gerald Lewers, in remembrance of an Australian sculptor, Lieutenant John Christie Wright, who was killed at age 28 during service in France in 1917. The current wall and steps surrounding the Obelisk were also constructed at this time.

According to Peter Webber, a former professor of architecture at the University of Sydney and a former government architect, the obelisk at Macquarie Place was damaged when a truck careered into its base in about 1970; the incised lettering on the replacement panels to the eastern side is crude by comparison with that on the undamaged surviving original panels. In 1976 several alterations were made including an extension of the western corner of the park, and alterations to pathways, Macquarie Place was closed to motor traffic, the iron drinking fountain was relocated, and plantings and paving were altered.

The park though somewhat reduced in size has continued to operate as a public space since 1810. Its landscaping and levels have changed but the obelisk remains in its original location and form. Towering buildings and trees now dominate the site. Sydney City Council allocated $450,000 for obelisk conservation works in 2006.

== Description ==
Macquarie Place is a triangular public open space surrounded on two sides (south, east) by a low sandstone wall.

Its plantings are mostly mature and include three plane trees (&quot;Platanus x hybrida&quot;) facing Loftus Street to its east, two Moreton Bay figs (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;) on the western side and an evergreen/holly/holm oak (&quot;Quercus ilex&quot;) flanked by two clumps of Lord Howe Island palms (&quot;Howea fosteriana&quot;) and one clump of soft tree ferns (&quot;Cyathea&quot; sp.) on the Bridge Street (southern) side. A young weeping lily pilly (Waterhousia floribunda) is also in the south-eastern corner.

Originally the park was approximately double its current size but was reduced sometime between late 1836 and 1843 by the construction of Loftus Street. Historically, the north west oblique boundary of Macquarie Place appears to be an important building alignment which, although buildings are different from those there in 1807, has remained relatively unchanged.

The park includes numerous monuments and memorials including:

;The Obelisk:
This is a sandstone obelisk designed by Francis Greenway and built by stonemason Edward Cureton between 1816 and 1818 to furnish Sydney&#x27;s first public square and to mark the place from which all public roads in the colony were to be measured. It is literally the &quot;hub&quot; of NSW, the datum point from which all distances in NSW were measured from Sydney. Its inscriptions record the extent of the road network in 1818.

The obelisk is designed in the Georgian period and detailed in the Greek revival style. The obelisk&#x27;s form seems to be directly influenced by Georgian examples rather than Egyptian: Greenway is reputed to have based his design on that of Nash in Bath. It is also possible the source of the Macquaries&#x27; fancy may have been the pair of obelisks in the Passeio Publico overlooking the harbour in Rio de Janeiro, which they visited in August 1809. It is an elongated pyramid on a narrow square pedestal decorated by projecting cornice and base. The pedestal contains the original inscription and is surrounded by a low stone wall with a later simple curved wrought iron balustrade. Building materials are sandstone and a wrought iron balustrade. The sandstone would have been quarried locally near Sydney Cove, however the exact location of the quarry is not known. There are no other structures in Sydney that are built from this particular fine grained white sandstone.

The lettering on the Obelisk is incised blackened lettering of a Roman type face in a style that is recognisably Georgian in style, and is one of only four remaining examples of this style and period of lettering in the inner City. This records the distances to the major outer settlements at the time of 1818 – namely Bathurst, Windsor, Parramatta, Liverpool, South Head and the North Head of Botany Bay.

;The &quot;Sirius&quot; anchor and cannon:
These are relics of the flagship of the First Fleet, of HMS &quot;Sirius&quot;, that was wrecked two years later in 1790 on Norfolk Island. The bronze statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, who died in 1878 is inscribed with the dedication on the plinth &quot;A pioneer of Australian resources, a founder of Australian industries, one who established our wool market&quot;. A Mayor of Sydney left his memorial with the 1869 sandstone gate posts facing Bridge Street marked with the words &quot;Walter Renny, Esq., Mayor 1869&quot;. Further 19th century and early 20th century public memorials relocated or erected in the park also include the 1908 domed lavatory (now partly an archaeological site) and an 1857 cast iron drinking fountain. A small bronze fountain designed by the renowned sculptor, Gerald Lewers, was installed in 1960. Two of the London Plane trees were planted in 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh. These trees mark the beginning of the Remembrance Driveway to Canberra.

;Archaeological remains
Possible footings (archaeological remains) of a fountain designed by Francis Greenway and Mrs Macquarie, built by the same contractor Edward Cureton under Mrs Macquarie&#x27;s direction: it was &quot;still unroofed&quot; in 1820. This was on the western side of Macquarie Place and supplied water to local residents. The fountain was demolished c. 1887 to make way for the statue of Thomas Mort.

;Thomas Sutcliffe Mort statue:
This c. 1887 statue looking out over Bridge Street, Sydney&#x27;s premier financial street, commemorates businessman and horticulturist, wool baron and frozen meat entrepreneur Thomas Sutcliffe Mort (1816–78), who emigrated to NSW in 1838 setting up as an auctioneer in 1843, becoming an innovator in wool sales. His wealth facilitated his considerable horticultural ambitions, realised at Sydney&#x27;s then-finest garden, Greenoaks (now Bishopscourt), Darling Point, which set the tone for villas in this fashionable Sydney resort. Mort employed gardeners Michael Guilfoyle, Michael Bell and George Mortimore, creating a celebrated landscape garden. President of the NSW Horticultural Society in the 1860s he pursued hybridisation of cacti.

;Memorial gate pillars facing Bridge Street &amp; Department of Lands Building:
These sandstone gate pillars commemorate Walter Penny, Mayor of Sydney, in 1869.

;Fountain and pond by Gerald Lewers:
This commemorates, an Australian sculptor, Lieutenant John Christie Wright, who was killed at age 28 during service in France in 1917.

=== Condition ===

As of 15 September 2005, the trees, monuments and park are all generally in good condition. The Heritage Council Technical Advisory Group is being consulted by City of Sydney Council for the restoration and maintenance of the Obelisk (2005).

In terms of archaeological potential, the site may contribute to our understanding of the settlement and occupation of early town leases in Sydney through its potential for archaeological remains from the pre-1814 development of the land as a town lease, which was levelled for the improvements by Governor Macquarie for the construction of the park. This is extremely rare on two accounts, first because it remained largely undeveloped from 1814 onwards, except as part of a reserve. Secondly, most archaeological sites in Sydney which relate to the occupation of town allotments to c.1814 have been destroyed by subsequent development.

The current extent of Macquarie Place dates from the 1830s when it was reduced by the construction of Loftus Street. The Obelisk has a high degree of original integrity and requires some restoration of the 1818 fabric. The Heritage Council Technical Advisory Group is being consulted by City of Sydney Council for the restoration of the Obelisk (2005).

=== Modifications and dates ===
Macquarie Place has been greatly reduced in size since Macquarie&#x27;s time. The park has been subject to various changes and stages of development over the years from the early 1800s. Some of these stages are:
*1792The land of Macquarie Place is represented as such in 1792 Governor Phillip&#x27;s Survey of the settlement
*1793Sketch of Sydney by Ferdinand Brambila also shows the land of Macquarie Place. The triangular shape responded to the natural topography of the original shoreline of Sydney Cove and the Tank Stream. The triangular area was formed by the intersection of three early Colonial roads running in direct lines between three important constructions of the colonial period, including the Guard House at the entrance to First Government House at the south-eastern tip of the triangle, the bridge over the Tank Stream at the south-western tip of the triangle, and the 1788 fortifications (replaced by the Dry Store in 1791) beside the Government Wharf at the northern tip of the triangle. Macquarie Place may have operated as a public place of gathering for the early settlement from as early as 1791 alongside the Dry Store, located in the approximate present-day location of Customs House. At least half of the population still depended upon this Dry Store for collecting their food rations by 1801.
*1807A triangular layout had been formalised (relating to the existing layout of plots) and a guard house built next to Government House&#x27;s main entrance.
*1810Macquarie set aside Macquarie Place as public ground.
*1818/19Obelisk and Doric Fountain built. The park in which it was built was divided into segments by paths leading to the sandstone obelisk. A low wall surrounded the reserve.
*1830sReduction of size of park.
*1869–1910Addition of various monuments.
*1910Changes including the reduction of number of fig trees.
*1954Two Plane trees planted.
*1960Fountain added.
*1976Alterations as listed in historical notes.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 8 December 2008, Macquarie Place represents one of the most historically significant urban spaces in Sydney and Australia, which was first established less than 25 years after the arrival of the First Fleet. The 1810 park and its later monuments outline the development of Sydney since its colonial foundation. Macquarie Place was the first and main town square of colonial Sydney and is a surviving remnant of the first town centre of Sydney beside First Government House (now demolished) and on the original foreshores of Sydney Cove before the shoreline was extended. The Obelisk, erected in Macquarie Place in 1818, is the geographic centre point of nineteenth century Sydney, the Colony, and the network of nineteenth century roads throughout NSW. It was erected in this location by Governor Macquarie to mark the place from where all public roads were to be measured and has continued to perform this function over most of the history of European settlement in Australia, for over 190 years. The park and monument were well recognised landmarks of colonial Sydney and appeared in many nineteenth century artist views, including paintings by Conrad Martens.

Although the original importance of Macquarie Place as the main town square of Sydney, the geographic and symbolic centre of the Colony, the setting to First Government House and the landmark qualities of Obelisk are now less apparent than in Colonial times due to the level of surrounding changes, the park and its monuments remain one of the few tangible links to this first Colonial town centre and thereby part of the earliest history of European settlement in Australia. It is also possibly the only remnant of the natural landform of the original foreshores of Sydney Cove which has survived relatively unchanged over two centuries of European settlement, and can therefore symbolise the first place of meeting between Aboriginal people of the Eora Country and British settlers at Sydney Cove in 1788.

Macquarie Place represents the oldest planned town square in Australia. Together with Hyde Park, it is also the oldest urban park in Australia, and has been in continuous use as a public space for at least 195 years, possibly operating as a public place of gathering from as early as 1791. The Obelisk is the oldest milestone for measuring of roads in Australia and the second oldest known European monument in Australia. The inscriptions on the Obelisk provide evidence of the extent of the small colony in 1818 when the colony was first expanding into the interior of New South Wales. The Obelisk was also the &quot;symbolic peg&quot; indicating the far extent of the British Empire in the early 1800s.

Macquarie Place and the Obelisk are rare surviving evidence of the transition of the Colony from a rough penal settlement to a planned town during the early 1800s under the direction of Governor Macquarie. This transition is demonstrated by the function of the Obelisk in the expansion of the Colony, by the establishment of a formal centre to the Colony, by the first formal layout of public space, and by the quality and design of the park and monument. The Obelisk and Macquarie Place are fine examples of the layout and ornamentation of Sydney town and its public spaces in the Georgian style, and rare surviving remnants of Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney, together with the Hyde Park Barracks, St James Church, and First Government House Stables (now the Conservatorium). The Obelisk was designed by one of the most celebrated architects of the Colonial period, Francis Greenway, and was built by stonemason, Edward Cureton, with convict labour.

These qualities of the Obelisk and Macquarie Place symbolise Macquarie&#x27;s vision for a permanent planned settlement, which provided the genesis for the development of the nation, and which far exceeded the views of the British Government of the Colony as simply a penal settlement. When the Obelisk was first erected in Macquarie Place, Commissioner Bigge, representing the British Government, found even this simple monument too grand for a penal colony. Governor Macquarie defended the expense and design of the monument with indignation as a &quot;little unadorned Obelisk...rendered at a trifling expense, somewhat ornamental to the Town&quot; which in his view did not &quot;merit any censure&quot;. It was this difference of opinion that contributed to the resignation of a disillusioned Governor Macquarie, and meant that many of his plans and Greenway&#x27;s designs for an elegant Georgian township were not realised.

The &quot;Sirius&quot; cannon and anchor mounted in Macquarie Place are rare relics of the first defences of the Colony by the man-of-war flagship of the First Fleet that arrived in Sydney Cove in 1788. Both the cannon and anchor have been mounted in Macquarie Place for over a century after the canon and anchor were salvaged from the wreck of the vessel in 1791 and 1905 respectively and mounted at Macquarie Place in the 1880s and 1907. Macquarie Place is also the site of the first constructed defences of Sydney Cove when the First Redoubt was built at its northern end as the first fortification of Sydney from 1788 to 1791.

Later public monuments and structures constructed in Macquarie Place illustrate the continued civic importance of the park and demonstrate the continued evolution and achievements in the civic planning, services, design, construction, industry and growth of Sydney since Colonial times.

Macquarie Place Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 5 March 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.

The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.

Macquarie Place represents one of the most historically significant urban spaces in Sydney and Australia, complete with numerous public monuments which demonstrate the history of Australian settlement from its colonial foundation. Macquarie Place was the first and main town square of colonial Sydney, and is a surviving remnant of the first town centre of Sydney beside First Government House (now demolished) and on the original foreshores of Sydney Cove before the shoreline was extended. The park and Obelisk were well recognised landmarks of colonial Sydney and appeared in many nineteenth century artist views, including paintings by Conrad Martens. Macquarie Obelisk and Macquarie Place both mark the geographic centre of the Colony during the early 1800s, and provide a very rare remnant of the early days of the development of Sydney Town and the planning of the Colony by Governor Macquarie.

Although the original importance of Macquarie Place as the main town square of Sydney, the geographic and symbolic centre of the Colony, the setting to First Government House and the landmark qualities of Obelisk are now less apparent than in Colonial times due to the level of surrounding changes, the park and its monuments remain one of the few tangible links to this first Colonial town centre and thereby part of the earliest history of European settlement in Australia. It is also possibly the only remnant of the natural landform of the original foreshores of Sydney Cove which has survived relatively unchanged over two centuries of European settlement, and can therefore symbolise the first place of meeting between Aboriginal people and British settlers at Sydney Cove in 1788.

Macquarie Obelisk is the oldest surviving milestone built to mark the place from which all public roads in the Colony were to be measured, and is the second oldest known European monument in Australia. Macquarie Place is the oldest urban park in Australia, together with Hyde Park, and has been in continuous use as a public space for over 190 years. Both Macquarie Place and the Obelisk were constructed less than 30 years after the arrival of the First Fleet near the original shores of Sydney Cove and First Government House.

The Obelisk was erected by Macquarie in 1818 as the &quot;zero point&quot; milestone from which the expansion of the Colony was physically measured. The inscriptions on the Obelisk evidence the extent of the relatively small Colony at the time. The Obelisk was also the &quot;symbolic peg&quot; indicating the far extent of the British Empire during the early 1800s.

The Obelisk and Macquarie Place provide rare evidence of the formative period of the colony, and its transition from a rough penal settlement to a planned town under the direction of Governor Macquarie. This was recognised shortly after the construction of the park and Obelisk by the ire of the British Government which objected to the elegance of public works by Governor Macquarie and specifically the Obelisk for being too grand for a penal settlement. The Obelisk and Macquarie Place symbolise Macquarie&#x27;s vision for a permanent planned settlement, which provided the genesis for the development of the nation, and which far exceeded the views of the British Government at the time. Both demonstrate the transition of the Colony from a rough penal settlement to a planned town by the function of the Obelisk in the expansion of the Colony, by the establishment of a formal centre to the Colony, by the first formal layout of public space, and by the quality and design of the park and monument.

Macquarie Place and its surrounding area is also the site of the first defences of the newly settled colony. It was the location of the First Redoubt which was the first attempt at fortifications at Sydney Cove (a plaque on the footpath marks the location of the First Redoubt). The &quot;Sirius&quot; cannon and anchor have been mounted at Macquarie Place since the 1880s and 1907 respectively, which are relics from the warship of the First Fleet and thus of the first settlement and defences by the British.

The triangular shape of the park is a remnant of the early Colonial street layout that responded to the natural topography of the Tank Stream valley and which linked three major constructions of the Colonial period including First Government House, the bridge over the Tank Stream, and the First Redoubt (replaced by the Dry Store) located beside Government Wharf. The remaining Moreton Bay Fig trees are remnants of the 1860s street planting scheme.

Later monuments in Macquarie Place demonstrate the evolution of Sydney from these earliest stages, its achievements, technological advancements and civic pride as a major City. The development of commerce and industry in Sydney, in particular the wool industry, is represented in Macquarie Place by a bronze statue of Thomas Sutcliffe Mort, who died in 1878. The statue of Thomas Mort represents the evolution of a new Sydney, a city conscious of its dignity as the nucleus of a self-supporting and expanding colony within the Empire. A Mayor of Sydney has also left his memorial with the 1869 stone gate posts facing Bridge Street marked with the words &quot;Walter Renny, Esq., Mayor 1869&quot;. The 1908 domed lavatory (now partly an archaeological site) records the major reforms and achievements of the early 20th century in sanitation, public health, technology and City design, which transformed Sydney and the other city centres of Australia into modern cities. Two of the London Plane trees in Macquarie Place planted in 1954 by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh commemorate the first visit to Australia by a reigning monarch, mark the beginning of the Remembrance Driveway to Canberra, and recreate the site&#x27;s original function of being the starting point for main roads from Sydney. A small bronze fountain designed by the renowned sculptor, Gerald Lewers, is a memorial to an Australian sculptor, Lieut. John Christie Wright, who was killed at age 28 during service in France in 1917.

The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales&#x27;s history.

The Obelisk was designed by one of the most celebrated architects of the Colonial period (and former convict convicted for forgery) Francis Greenway, and was built by stonemason Edward Cureton with convict labour. The Obelisk was one of the first works of Greenway where he was given a free hand after he was appointed as the first Colonial Architect. It formed part of a group of civic adornments designed by Greenway but was the only one built due to the intervention of Commissioner Bigge for the British Government.

Macquarie Pace and the Obelisk at its centre were built under the direction of Governor Macquarie and is strongly associated with Macquarie and his planning of the colony. The park and monument both symbolise the divide between Macquarie&#x27;s vision for the permanent planned settlement and expansion of the Colony and the view of the British Government at the time of the Colony as simply a penal settlement. When the Obelisk was first erected, Commissioner Bigge, representing the British Government, found even this simple monument too grand for a penal colony. Governor Macquarie defended the expense and design of the monument with indignation as a &quot;little unadorned Obelisk...rendered at a trifling expense, somewhat ornamental to the Town&quot; which in his view did not &quot;merit any censure&quot;. It was this difference of opinion, symbolised by the monument, on the expenditure for a penal colony that contributed to the resignation of a disillusioned Governor Macquarie, and meant that many of his plans and Greenway&#x27;s designs for an elegant Georgian township were not realised.

The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The Obelisk and Macquarie Place are rare remnants of Governor Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney based on a regular planned layout and elegant buildings, set within picturesque landscaped grounds. They are fine examples of the early planning, ornamentation and urban design of the Colony and its public spaces in the Georgian style, of which few designs were realised at the time and fewer still have survived to the present. Macquarie Place is joined by the Hyde Park Barracks, the former Government House stables (now the Conservatorium) and St James Church as some of the few surviving remnants of Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney.

The Place and the Obelisk was a well recognised landmark of the new colony and appeared in many nineteenth century artist views, including paintings for example by Conrad Martens.

Macquarie Place is also a fine example of triangular parks and street patterns of the early Colonial period that responded to the natural topography of the original foreshore of Circular Quay and the Tank Stream valley.

The design of the Obelisk and the park is an early example of the introduction of the Neo-Classical revival, imported from the Georgian city of Bath in England. Greenway is reputed to have based his design on the Georgian Obelisk erected by Beau Nash in Bath more so than the Egyptian prototypes. The design of Macquarie Place and the Obelisk are in contrast with earlier buildings in Australia which are considered to be vernacular, whereas the design of these features could be traced to the Georgian style. The proportions of the Obelisk are designed according to the Georgian rules of style and taste, which differ to later Victorian examples. The layout of the triangular park of Macquarie Place, centred on the Obelisk, incorporated many aspects of Georgian town planning, where Macquarie Place and the Obelisk were deliberately designed as part of the picturesque landscaped setting for the first Government House.

The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.

Macquarie Place is an important green space in the city&#x27;s central business district, providing an attractive green space for city residents and workers. Historically it formed the main town square of Sydney which was a popular place for early citizens of the Colony to promenade. Its continued use as a public space for over 200 years has important social significance.

The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

The obelisk is symbolic of the expansion of the colony and as an outpost of the British Empire. The Obelisk is of research significance because it forms the central pivot of the system of highways constructed in New South Wales from the early years of the Colony in 1818. It is a well preserved example of a marker stone from which distances were measured, which continued to be used for this purpose for a lengthy period.

The site is of scientific significance because it may contribute to our understanding of the settlement and occupation of early town leases in Sydney through its potential for archaeological remains from the pre-1814 development of the land as a town lease, which was levelled for the improvements by Governor Macquarie for the construction of the park. The site is extremely rare on two accounts, first because it remained largely undeveloped from 1814 onwards, except as part of a reserve. Secondly, most archaeological sites in Sydney which relate to the occupation of town allotments to c.1814 have been destroyed by subsequent development.

There are no other structures in Sydney like the Obelisk that are built from its particular fine grained white sandstone. Unusually for Obelisks, this obelisk needle was constructed of ashlar blocks of sandstone because, despite the availability of a convict labour force, the technology for excavating a single block of sandstone was not available in Colonial Sydney at the time. It also provides evidence of one of the few surviving examples of wrought iron balustrading of its quality and period.

Archaeological remains may also survive of the 1819–1820 Doric Fountain designed by Francis Greenway. These lie somewhere in the vicinity of the T.S. Mort statue, possibly further towards the corner of Bridge Street and Macquarie Place. The building alignment on the northwest oblique boundary and the southern boundary is essentially the same as that existing in 1807 as depicted in James Meehan&#x27;s Plan of the Town of Sydney (see attached map). This remnant street alignment has the potential to provide and important insight into the layout and planning of Sydney in its very early days.

The sandstone dwarf wall originally constructed around Macquarie Place in 1816 is of scientific significance because it preserves evidence of the former configuration and appearance of Macquarie Place and its formal improvements at this time.

The bower anchor (the main anchors) and cannon from the &quot;Sirius&quot; demonstrates aspects of shipbuilding and iron technology of the late 18th century, and have historical associations with the first settlement of Australian in 1788 by belonging to the flagship of the First Fleet. The anchor demonstrates the Admiralty Old Pattern Long Shanked type of anchor that was in common use throughout the 18th century by most major Navies and merchant vessels.

The covered cast iron drinking fountain dating from c. 1857 demonstrates an example of one of a group of such fountains manufactured in Britain for Sydney town and installed in prominent positions around the city, associated with the early provision of water by piped water mains for public use. It was relocated to Macquarie Place in the 1970s. It demonstrates a fine example of ornamental cast ironwork.

The 1907 domed Underground Public Conveniences (now partly an archaeological site) is a fine example of an Edwardian public convenience and its associated building and sanitation technology, demonstrating the high quality provision of public health and sanitation measures in Sydney following the outbreak of the Bubonic plague.

The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.

Macquarie Place and the Macquarie Obelisk provide very rare remnants of the early development of Sydney township and the earliest planning of the Colony. They provide rare surviving evidence of Governor Macquarie&#x27;s vision for Sydney as a permanent planned settlement, which began the transition of the Colony from a rough penal settlement to a planned town during the early 1800s.

Macquarie Place and the Obelisk are rare evidence of the early Colonial town centre from where all public roads were measured, where the Colony was first governed, near where the First Fleet landed, where the first defences were built, where the early elite of Sydney lived, and where the first town square was laid out. Since this time, the foreshore of Sydney Cove (now Circular Quay) has been extended, first Government House has been demolished, the adjoining part of the Domain was redeveloped as part of the main town, the Tank Stream has been covered, and the centre of the town moved to the South. Although the original importance of Macquarie Place as the symbolic and geographic centre of the early Colony, the main town square of Sydney, the setting to first Government House, and the landmark qualities of the Obelisk are now less apparent than in Colonial times due to the level of surrounding changes, the park and its early monuments remain one of the few tangible links to this first Colonial town centre and thereby part of the earliest history of Australia.

Macquarie Place and the Macquarie Obelisk are rare as surviving evidence of the attempts by Governor Macquarie and his wife to construct Sydney as a Georgian town with a regular planned layout and elegant buildings, set within picturesque landscaped grounds. The Hyde Park Barracks and St James Church are other rare surviving remnants of Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney (also designed by Greenway).

Macquarie Place is the first planned town square in Australia, gazetted in 1810 and which possibly operated as a gathering place from as early as 1791. Macquarie Place is now the oldest formally laid out town square in Australia. It is also the oldest urban park in Australia, together with Hyde Park, and has been in continuous use as a public space for at least 195 years.

The Macquarie Place Obelisk is rare as the second oldest surviving European monument in Australia, dating from 1818.

The Macquarie Place Obelisk is very rare as the first and oldest &quot;zero point&quot; milestone from which public roads were measured. The other known standing milestone of this kind and of a later date is in Kiama, although in a deteriorated condition, which provided the zero point for all roads into the town.

The only known older obelisk and European monument in Australia is the 1811 obelisk at Watson&#x27;s Bay which was erected by Macquarie&#x27;s regiment to commemorate their achievement in constructing a road to South Head. There are no known examples of obelisks or other European monuments built before the Watson&#x27;s Bay and Macquarie Place obelisks. Other obelisks from later in the nineteenth century were erected as memorials of significant events, as ornamental picturesque objects in the landscape, or to disguise functional elements like the obelisk of the Hyde Park sewer vent at the eastern end of Bathurst Street.

The inscriptions in the Obelisk are also rare as a tangible record of the extent of the Colony at a fixed time during the early Colonial period, providing evidence of the expansion of the Colony into the interiors of NSW during this period of transition from a penal settlement to a permanent planned town. It provides an official record that shows the actual extent of colonial settlement at that time, as distinguished from some maps from this period which indicate the colony extended over most of the continent.

The Obelisk is a rare example of the work of the first Colonial Architect, Francis Greenway. It is the only Obelisk designed by Greenway that was constructed, and one of few of his constructed works to have survived. Only the Government House Stables (now converted and altered for the Conservatorium of Music), St James Church, Hyde Park Barracks and the Obelisk remain of Greenway&#x27;s vision for Sydney Cove of the early 1800s.

The Macquarie Obelisk is one of few remaining convict built structures in the inner city. It is also rare for its construction of ashlar blocks for the needle rather than a single piece of sandstone, and for its materials as there are no other structures in Sydney that are built from its particular fine grained white sandstone. The Obelisk is rare for its carved detailing, as the carved fan motifs (the Acroteria) at the base of the shaft are one of the earliest examples of decorative carving in the Colony for a civic purpose, and the use of the Acroteria detail is rare generally for obelisks. The Macquarie Obelisk also provides evidence of one of the few surviving examples of wrought iron balustrading of its quality and period. It is one of only four examples of the style of incised lettering which now remain in inner Sydney, all of which date from the Macquarie era.

The anchor and cannon from the &quot;Sirius&quot; are rare relics of the flagship man-of-war from the First Fleet, and thus the earliest European settlement and defence of Australia. Of the 22 six-pounder canons offloaded or salvaged from the vessel in 1788 and 1791–1796, there is only one other known surviving six-pounder cannon from the &quot;Sirius&quot; where its provenance has been established within reasonable doubt, which is now held by the National Maritime Museum. The anchor is one of only three known surviving bower anchors (the main anchors) from the &quot;Sirius&quot;. The other two are located at the National Maritime Museum and Norfolk Island. The anchor is rare in New South Wales as a surviving example of the Admiralty Old Pattern Long Shanked type of anchor. Only five other examples of this type of anchor have been identified in New South Wales as underwater archaeological relics or are on public display.

The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

The Obelisk and Macquarie Place represents the geographic and symbolic centre of Sydney during the early Colonial period, from which all public roads were measured and as the main town square separating the town lots of the elite of Sydney from the grounds of first Government House.

The triangular shape of Macquarie Place represents the early town planning in Sydney when street planning responded to the natural topography of the original foreshore of Circular Quay and the Tank Stream, instead of a formal grid pattern. The remaining fig trees also represent the street planting of the time, influenced by Charles Moore, the Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, 1848–1896.

The Obelisk is an example of the markers used as the point from which distances are measured found in major city centres. It operated as the &quot;zero point&quot; for measuring the distance of roads from Sydney from 1818 until this function was replaced by the General Post Office.

Macquarie Place and the Obelisk are fine examples of the early planning, ornamentation and urban design of the Colony and its public spaces during the early 1800s based on Governor Macquarie&#x27;s plan and Francis Greenway&#x27;s designs for an elegant Georgian township, of which few designs were realised at the time and fewer still have survived to the present. They form part of a group of the few surviving remnants of Macquarie&#x27;s Georgian town plan for Sydney also including the Hyde Park Barracks, the former Government House stables (now the Conservatorium) and St James Church.

The design of the Obelisk and the park are a fine example of the introduction of the Neo-Classical revival, imported from the Georgian city of Bath in England. Greenway is reputed to have based his design on the Georgian Obelisk erected by Beau Nash in Bath more so than the Egyptian prototypes. The design of Macquarie Place and the Obelisk are in contrast with earlier buildings in Australia which are considered to be vernacular, whereas the design of these features could be traced to the Georgian style. The proportions of the Obelisk are designed according to the Georgian rules of style and taste, which differ to later Victorian examples. The layout of the triangular park of Macquarie Place, centred on the Obelisk, incorporated many aspects of Georgian town planning, where Macquarie Place and the Obelisk were deliberately designed as part of the picturesque landscaped setting for the first Government House.

The Macquarie Obelisk is a fine example of a monument constructed in the form of an Obelisk. While characteristic for obelisks in many of its features, there are significant design variations. It is a fine example of the unusual use of the Acroteria motif detail in the carving and the construction of the needle from ashlar blocks of sandstone rather than a single piece of sandstone.

<text>WiseNut was a crawler-based search engine that officially launched on September 5, 2001. Like Teoma, WiseNut automatically clustered search results, a technology called &quot;WiseGuide&quot;. Despite being referred to as a &quot;Google killer&quot; and having a good start, WiseNut never managed to become a major search engine. It lacked boolean search in the standard search and other advanced search features. The company was based in San Francisco, California.

On March 12, 2002, LookSmart announced that they would be acquiring WiseNut for about $9.25 million in stock. LookSmart completed the acquisition in April.

WiseNut shut down in late-September 2007.

<doc id="613749" wikidata="Q187459" url="?curid=613749" title="Entablature">
<text>An entablature (; nativization of Italian , from &quot;in&quot; and &quot;table&quot;) is the superstructure of moldings and bands which lies horizontally above columns, resting on their capitals. Entablatures are major elements of classical architecture, and are commonly divided into the architrave (the supporting member immediately above; equivalent to the lintel in post and lintel construction), the frieze (an unmolded strip that may or may not be ornamented), and the cornice (the projecting member below the pediment). The Greek and Roman temples are believed to be based on wooden structures, the design transition from wooden to stone structures being called petrification.

==Overview==
The structure of an entablature varies with the orders of architecture. In each order, the proportions of the subdivisions (architrave, frieze, cornice) are defined by the proportions of the column. In Roman and Renaissance interpretations, it is usually approximately a quarter of the height of the column. Variants of entablature that do not fit these models are usually derived from them.

=== Doric ===
In the pure classical Doric order entablature is simple. The architrave, the lowest band, is split, from bottom to top, into the guttae, the regulae, and the taenia.

The frieze is dominated by the triglyphs, vertically channelled tablets, separated by metopes, which may or may not be decorated. The triglyphs sit on top of the taenia, a flat, thin, horizontal protrusion, and are finished at the bottom by decoration (often ornate) of &#x27;drops&#x27; called guttae, which belong to the top of the architrave. The top of the triglyphs meet the protrusion of the cornice from the entablature. The underside of this protrusion is decorated with mutules, tablets that are typically finished with guttae.

The cornice is split into the soffit, the corona, and the cymatium. The soffit is simply the exposed underside. The corona and the cymatium are the principal parts of the cornice.

=== Ionic ===
The Ionic order of entablature adds the fascia in the architrave, which are flat horizontal protrusions, and the dentils under the cornice, which are tooth-like rectangular block moldings.

=== Corinthian ===
The Corinthian order adds a far more ornate cornice, divided, from bottom to top, into the cyma reversa, the dentils, the ovolo, the modillions, the fascia, and the cyma recta. The modillions are ornate brackets, similar in use to dentils, but often in the shape of acanthus leaves.

The frieze is sometimes omitted—for example, on the portico of the caryatides of the Erechtheum—and probably did not exist as a structure in the temple of Diana at Ephesus. Neither is it found in the Lycian tombs, which are reproductions in the rock of timber structures based on early Ionian work. The entablature is essentially an evolution of the primitive lintel, which spans two posts, supporting the ends of the roof rafters.

=== Non-classical architecture ===
The entablature together with the system of classical columns occurs rarely outside classical architecture. It is often used to complete the upper portion of a wall where columns are not present, and in the case of pilasters (flattened columns or projecting from a wall) or detached or engaged columns it is sometimes profiled around them. The use of the entablature, irrespective of columns, appeared after the Renaissance.

<text>Sunbury ( , ) is a satellite town of Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Sunbury recorded a population of 38,851 at the .

Statistically, Sunbury is considered part of Greater Melbourne, as per the Victorian Government&#x27;s 2009 decision to extend the urban growth boundary in 2011 to include the area in the Melbourne Urban Area as the north-western fringe of the Greater Melbourne area, giving its land urban status and value.

==History==

The Sunbury area has several important Aboriginal archaeological sites, including five earth rings, which were identified in the 1970s and 1980s, and believed to have been used for ceremonial gatherings. Records of corroborees and other large gatherings during early settlement attest to the importance of the area for Aboriginal people of the Wurundjeri tribe. One Indigenous name for the area of unknown language and meaning is &#x27;Koorakoorakup&#x27;.

Sunbury was first settled in 1836, by George Evans and William Jackson. It was Jackson and his brother, Samuel, who named the township Sunbury, after Sunbury-on-Thames, in Middlesex, England when it was established in 1857. The Post Office opened on 13 January 1858.

Sunbury&#x27;s connection with the history and development of Victoria is influential because of its most famous and powerful citizen, &quot;Big&quot; Clarke. In 1837, Clarke came to the area, and gained vast pastoral licences encompassing Sunbury, Clarkefield and Monegeetta. His role as one of the biggest pastoralists in the colony, and his power and position within the Victorian Legislative Council, were highly significant in the early years of Victoria.

During the early decades of self-government in the Colony of Victoria there was a continual struggle in parliament, between the Legislative Assembly and the Legislative Council for ascendancy and the control of government. It was Council members, such as Clarke, who attempted to negate what they saw as the excesses of manhood suffrage, republicanism and Chartism, as embodied in the Assembly, in order to protect their own position.

&quot;Big&quot; Clarke, as a member of the so-called bunyip aristocracy, also helped to frustrate legislative measures involving opening land to small farm selectors. &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot; depicted Clarke in anti-squatter cartoons, such as &quot;The Man in Possession&quot; In 1859, &quot;Big&quot; Clarke was involved in a scandal around the discovery of gold on his holdings in Deep Creek. Shares in the Bolinda company soared and Clarke sold his shares at the peak of the rush, before the fraud was exposed. The gold assay was actually &#x27;salted&#x27;, possibly via a shotgun blast of golden pellets into the samples. Clarke claimed the rich assay was proved when washed in a soup bowl. The ever-barbed &quot;Melbourne Punch&quot; explained how the fraud worked in a cartoon of a chipped Chinese Willow Pattern plate titled &quot;The Soup Plate&quot;.

In 1874, Clarke&#x27;s son William built a mansion on an estate named &quot;Rupertswood&quot;, after his own son, Rupert. The estate had access to a private railway station. Though the station was constructed in the late 19th century, the Clarkes did not pay the railways for its construction until the 1960s. (Rupertswood railway station was closed as a result of the Regional Fast Rail project and is now only a disused platform). The Clarkes also had a connection to the Kelly Gang story via their police connection with Superintendent Hare.

The younger William was the president of the Melbourne Cricket Club, and it was through that position that the touring English cricket team came to spend the Christmas of 1882 at Rupertswood. On Christmas Eve, the English team played a social game of cricket against a local team. Lady Clarke took one or more bails, burnt them, and put the ashes in a small urn, wrapped in a red velvet bag, which she presented to the English Captain, Ivo Bligh. She proposed that the ashes be used as a perpetual trophy for matches between the two countries. The Ashes has since become one of the world&#x27;s most sought-after sporting trophies.

In 1922, the Clarke family sold the property to H V McKay, the owner of the Sunshine Harvester Works, who died in 1926. His estate sold the property in 1927 to the Salesian Catholic order. Until recently, the mansion and surrounding property were used for educational and agricultural purposes, and as a boarding school for students undertaking both academic and agricultural endeavours. The school, known as Salesian College, Rupertswood, is still located on the property. The mansion has been restored, and is used for weddings and other formal functions.

In the early 1970s, the area, which was then still largely rural, became famous in Australia as the site of the Sunbury Pop Festival, which was held annually from 1972 to 1975.

==Culture==
Sunbury&#x27;s residents represent diverse cultural backgrounds, and include a major working-class sector, dependent on proximity to major manufacturing and transport hubs, such as Melbourne Airport which is only from the township. A recent trend for people who work in the Melbourne CBD to trade longer commute times for a more economic lifestyle (due to cheaper housing), has seen the population of Sunbury grow in number, with numerous new housing estates ringing the borders of the established township. Sunbury&#x27;s population was recorded as being 25,086 in the 2001 census, and is estimated at 34,000 in , making it the 38th largest urban centre by population in Australia.

==Transport==
===Bus===
Ten bus routes service Sunbury:
* : Sunbury station – Diggers Rest station. Operated by Sunbury Bus Service.
* : Westfield Airport West – Sunbury station via Melbourne Airport. Operated by CDC Melbourne.

===Train===
Sunbury station is connected by Metro services to Melbourne on the Sunbury Line and by V/Line services on the Bendigo line to both Melbourne and country Victoria. V/Line services are not as frequent as those on the metropolitan Metro service – an approximate hourly frequency is provided by V/Line on weekdays, although on weekends service levels can be as infrequent as once every 80 minutes.

The State Government electrified the tracks between Sunbury and Sydenham in a $270 million investment, bringing more frequent passenger services to the town – these Metro services started operating on 18 November 2012.

<doc id="613753" wikidata="Q1666557" url="?curid=613753" title="Revolving credit">
<text>Revolving credit is a type of credit that does not have a fixed number of payments, in contrast to installment credit. Credit cards are an example of revolving credit used by consumers. Corporate revolving credit facilities are typically used to provide liquidity for a company&#x27;s day-to-day operations. They were first introduced by the Strawbridge and Clothier Department Store.

It is an arrangement which allows for the loan amount to be withdrawn, repaid, and redrawn again in any manner and any number of times, until the arrangement expires. Credit card loans and overdrafts are revolving loans, also called evergreen loan.

==Typical characteristics==
* The borrower may use or withdraw funds up to a pre-approved credit limit.
* The amount of available credit decreases and increases as funds are borrowed and then repaid.
* The credit may be used repeatedly.
* The borrower makes payments based only on the amount used or withdrawn, plus interest.
* The borrower may repay over time (subject to any minimum payment requirement), or in full at any time.
* In some cases, the borrower is required to pay a fee to the lender for any money that is undrawn; this is especially true of corporate bank revolving-credit loans.

A revolving loan provides a borrower with a maximum aggregate amount of capital, available over a specified period of time. Unlike a term loan, the revolving loan allows the borrower to draw down, repay and re-draw loans on the available funds during the term of the note. Each loan is borrowed for a set period of time, usually one, three or six months, after which time it is technically repayable.

Repayment of a revolving loan is achieved either by scheduled reductions in the total amount of the loan over time, or by all outstanding loans being repaid on the date of termination. A revolving loan made to refinance another revolving loan which matures on the same date as the drawing of the second revolving loan is known as a &quot;rollover loan&quot;, if made in the same currency and drawn by the same borrower as the first revolving loan. The conditions to be satisfied for drawing a rollover loan are typically less onerous than those for other loans.

A revolving loan is a particularly flexible financing tool as it may be drawn by a borrower by way of straightforward loans, but it is also possible to incorporate different types of financial accommodation within it – for example, it is possible to incorporate a letter of credit, a swingline (that is, a short-term borrowing that is funded on one day&#x27;s notice), or an overdraft within the terms of a revolving credit loan. This is often achieved by creating a sublimit within the overall loan, allowing a certain amount of the lenders&#x27; commitment to be drawn in the form of these different facilities.

In project finance, revolving credit facilities—commonly known as &quot;revolvers&quot;—are employed to manage short-term liquidity and ensure that critical debt service obligations are met even when operational cash flows are variable. For example, a renewable energy project might secure a $1,000,000 revolving credit facility. When the project draws $400,000 for operational expenses, it is charged an upfront fee—typically around 1.5% of the total facility (amounting to $15,000)—and interest is assessed on the drawn amount. This interest is calculated as the sum of a fixed margin and a floating base rate; for instance, with a 2.0% margin and a 3.5% base rate, the effective rate becomes 5.5%, resulting in annual interest costs of approximately $22,000 on the $400,000 drawn. Moreover, the undrawn portion of the facility ($600,000 in this example) incurs a commitment fee, often calculated as a percentage of the margin—for example, 40% of the 2.0% margin, which equates to an effective fee rate of 0.8% (or $4,800 per year). These fees collectively ensure that funds are available when needed while compensating the lender for maintaining the credit line. In certain projects, this structure is integrated with a Debt Service Reserve Facility (DSRF), so that if the project’s Cash Flow Available for Debt Service (CFADS) falls short of the scheduled debt service—say, if only $80,000 is available when $100,000 is required—the DSRF can cover the shortfall and help maintain debt repayments.

<text>Westmeadows is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Hume local government area. Westmeadows recorded a population of 6,502 at the .

Mainly a residential suburb, Westmeadows includes the areas east and west of Mickleham Road. It borders include Yuroke Creek between Johnstone Street and Barry Road (the eastern limit), the border with Attwood (the water pipes path parallel to Toora Drive and Linga and Kenny Streets) as well as the Moonee Ponds Creek east of Mickleham Road (the northern limits) and just before the Cleanaway Landfill (the western limit). The area north of residential Westmeadows (still part of Westmeadows) contains the east–west flight path for the Melbourne Airport, Tullamarine. The land under the flight path has been kept undeveloped and is the Broadmeadows Valley Park. It contains two streams which flow into the Moonee Ponds Creek.

==History==

The Broadmeadows area, home to the Wurundjeri Aboriginal tribe prior to European settlement, was settled by pastoralists in the 1840s.

Westmeadows contains the original Broadmeadows Village on the Moonee Ponds Creek, but is now west of the present Broadmeadows. The first Broadmeadows township was laid out by a Government survey in 1850. Ardlie Street was its commercial centre with a hotel (the Broadmeadows Hotel, now Westmeadows Tavern), the police station and the Shire office (the District Roads Board Building, opened in 1866). The first Broadmeadows Post Office opened here on 1 January 1855, was renamed Broadmeadows West in 1955 then Westmeadows in 1963.

The Anglican Church was opened in 1850 a little to the east, a Presbyterian Church was opened in the same decade, the Vicarage for the Anglican Church in 1860 and the St Anne&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church in 1867. A school begun in Westmeadows in 1851. However, the present primary school site dates from 1870.

Broadmeadows township and the urban centre began to be moved two kilometres eastwards when the railway line and station were opened in 1872. Shire loyalties clung to the old township until new civic offices were built near the railway station in 1928.

The Housing Commission began the building of a 2,226 ha. estate in the Broadmeadows area in 1949. Not until 1975 did it begin building in the vicinity of the old township, which it called Westmeadows Heights. Between 1975 and 1979 it built over 900 houses in the area.

===Landmarks===

There are many historic buildings and landmarks still surviving in Westmeadows. These include the Shire Offices and the Bluestone Bridge over the Moonee Ponds Creek (built in 1869, part of Fawkner Street) which are both on the Register of the National Estate. The original Westmeadows Police Station (no longer in use, since the opening of the Broadmeadows Police Station) and the Westmeadows Gaol are also still standing. The original Anglican church is still being used (presently on Raleigh Street).

The Old Coach House (10 Broad Street) 

Local information suggests the place has been known as the Old Coach House, suggesting a connection with the coaching activities of Cobb &amp; Co. and that it was the site of Grant&#x27;s Livery Stables in 1850, a stop-over for coaches operating between Melbourne and Broadmeadows. The Coach Service ran daily from the Bush Inn in Bourke Street Melbourne, leaving there a 4:00pm and returning at 8:00am the next day (return far 4/-) (Historical Society).

<text>Northern Rivers is the most northeasterly region of the Australian state of New South Wales, located between north of the state capital, Sydney, and encompasses the catchments and fertile valleys of the Clarence, Richmond, and Tweed rivers. It extends from Tweed Heads in the north (adjacent to the Queensland border) to the southern extent of the Clarence river catchment which lies between Grafton and Coffs Harbour, and includes the main towns of Tweed Heads, Byron Bay, Ballina, Kyogle, Lismore, Casino and Grafton. At its most northern point, the region is south-southeast of the Queensland capital, Brisbane.

As with all regions of New South Wales, it has no official status, although state government department offices and local governments in the area work together for purposes such as tourism, education, water catchment management and waste management. This area has a mild, sub-tropical climate. Major industries are agriculture, fisheries, public services (particularly health) and tourism; the region is also popular for niche crops, hobby farmers, and retirees from life in the larger cities.

==Geography==
The Northern Rivers region is bounded by the Coral Sea and the Tasman Sea to the east and the New England region to the west, where the Great Dividing Range forms a mountainous boundary. To the north is the border between New South Wales and Queensland, where the Darling Downs are located to the north-west and South East Queensland directly to the north. The southern boundary is the Dorrigo ranges, which also mark the southern boundary for the Clarence River Basin.

The defining characteristic of the region are the fertile valleys of the Clarence, Richmond and Tweed rivers and their sources, hence the region&#x27;s name; and the region&#x27;s white sandy beaches.

===Demography and area===
The following local government areas are contained within the region:

The region is traversed by the Pacific Highway, Bruxner Highway, Clarence Way, Summerland Way and the North Coast railway line which links Sydney to Brisbane.

===Characteristics===
The northernmost part of the region contains Mount Warning and the surrounding remnants of the long-extinct Tweed Volcano, portions of which extend into southern Queensland. Immediately to the south was formerly the &quot;Big Scrub&quot;, an extensive area of subtropical rainforest that was largely cleared for timber-getting and subsequently dairy farming in the nineteenth century. The major towns of the area developed at the navigable heads of the local river systems (Murwillumbah on the Tweed, Lismore on the Wilsons – a tributary of the Richmond – and Grafton on the Clarence) rather than on the coast, in order to be able to transport the valuable timber products (in particular the Australian red cedar, &quot;Toona ciliata&quot;) to markets interstate and overseas. Dairy production in the region was extensive up until the 1970s and many towns in the area retain their dairy processing plants (&quot;butter factories&quot;) from that era, now largely re-purposed for other uses; dairy cattle were then largely replaced with beef cattle for economic reasons, although some dairy production remains. The north of the region is an important sugarcane growing area with smaller contributions from coffee, bananas and assorted tropical fruit and vegetables. The hills with their red volcanic soils inland from Byron Bay provide Australia&#x27;s main region for the cultivation of macadamia trees which are used for their production of both raw nuts and macadamia oil. Ballina is a fishing port and was a centre for Australia&#x27;s east coast offshore prawn industry, although boat numbers have declined in recent years, while additional vessels operate out of Iluka and Yamba. Byron Bay was at one time a centre for commercial whaling as well as mineral extraction via sand mining. Further south, the rural portions of the Clarence river catchment are predominantly used for forestry, agriculture and grazing.

The region as a whole includes a significant component of New South Wales&#x27; state forests and national parks, and tourism is important in the north of the region in particular, especially in Tweed Heads, which is effectively a southern extension of the Gold Coast, and Byron Bay, which has developed a reputation as both a centre for relaxation and &quot;alternative&quot; health practices such as yoga, and at certain times of the year, a convenient out-of-town recreation area for partygoers from the major urban centres of south-east Queensland. The village of Nimbin, in the Lismore area, also attracts tourists interested in its reputation for environmental and alternative living initiatives such as permaculture, sustainability, and self-sufficiency, as well as its often-cited counterculture which includes lobbying for the decriminalisation of recreational and medicinal cannabis, as evidenced by its annual MardiGrass celebration. Following some decades of population decline with the reduction of certain primary industry (in particular dairying), the area is now seeing a population increase, in part because of the availability of ex-dairy land for newer niche crops and hobby farms along with an influx of &quot;sea change&quot; and &quot;tree change&quot; families, as well as retirees attracted by the region&#x27;s subtropical climate and unique combination of lifestyle attributes.

From the 1970s onwards, the northern portion of the region has also been the scene of successful environmental protests aimed at preventing the destruction of the area&#x27;s significant natural assets, including the 1979 Terania Creek anti-logging protest in the Nightcap National Park which led to the then Wran State Government gazetting remaining rainforest in New South Wales as National Parks, the 2014 Bentley blockade, which protested against exploratory drilling for gas at that location, and flow-on community reaction which eventually led to the New South Wales State Government buying back a coal seam gas exploration licence covering more than 500,000 hectares across the region in October 2015.

Prior to European settlement in the nineteenth century, the region was home to the Aboriginal Bundjalung people (or Bandjalang) (including the Widjabul of the Lismore region, the Arakwal of the Byron Bay area, and the Kalibal and Minjungbal of the Tweed and Queensland border) and the Gumbaynggirr and Yaegl peoples to the south, which collectively still form a component of the local population, and have been successful in some native title land claims on behalf of local Bandjalang and Yaegl communities.

==Education==

The region contains the Southern Cross University, which is headquartered at Lismore and has campuses in Tweed Heads and Coffs Harbour. The North Coast Institute of TAFE has campuses at Lismore, Ballina, Casino, Grafton, Kingscliff, Maclean, Trenayr, Wollongbar and Yamba.

There are several local sporting competitions, including:
*Association football – Football Far North Coast

*Don Gulley Oval, Kyogle
*Stan Paine Oval, Evans Head
*Kingsford Smith Park, Ballina
*Geoff Watt Oval, Alstonville
*Red Devil Park, Byron Bay
*Williams Reserve, Lennox Head

== Culture ==
The Northern Rivers has its own orchestras, the Northern Rivers Symphony Orchestra based in Murwillumbah and the Lismore Symphony Orchestra. Murwillumbah, Lismore and Grafton all have regional art galleries; that at Murwillumbah (the Tweed Regional Gallery) includes the Margaret Olley Art Centre named after the prominent locally-born Australian artist Margaret Olley and includes examples of her work plus a recreation of areas of Olley&#x27;s famous home studio, principally the Hat Factory and the Yellow Room.

===History of settlement===
The region has a history of Italian settlement. The locality of New Italy was settled in 1882 by Italian pioneers who attempted to cultivate the area&#x27;s difficult interior, while additional phases of migration followed in the 1920s and again with the post-World War II influx of European migrants anxious to escape their war-ravaged country. They typically leased hilly land from local farmers on which they cultivated bananas, moving to other trades when the local banana industry declined when refrigeration and better transport links facilitated the supply of cheaper competition from Queensland.

== Rail transport ==
The Northern Rivers was served for over a century by the Murwillumbah railway line, although, amidst some ongoing controversy, services were suspended in 2004.

<doc id="613762" wikidata="Q805263" url="?curid=613762" title="Ballina, New South Wales">
<text>Ballina () is a town in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia, and the seat of the Ballina Shire local government area. It lies north of Sydney and south of Brisbane. Ballina&#x27;s urban population at the end of 2021 was 46,190. 

The town lies on the Richmond River and serves as a gateway to Byron Bay.

==History==
Ballina is located on the ancestral land of the Bundjalung people, who are its traditional owners and original inhabitants. Archaeological evidence demonstrates Bundjalung occupation of the region for at least 6000 years. One view suggests that the name Ballina comes from corruption of a clan name for the &quot;Bullina&quot; or &quot;Bul-loona&quot; band of the Arakwal. It has been argued that in this tribe&#x27;s Bundjalung language, meant &quot;place of many oysters&quot;. This theory argues that the Aboriginal name reminded the predominantly Irish settlers of &quot;Ballina&quot;, so the name&#x27;s origin could be an accidental or deliberate corruption. Another view is that town&#x27;s name comes from the Irish placename Ballina (&quot;Béal an Átha&quot;, &quot;mouth of the ford&quot;), which is found in several parts of Ireland.

Ballina was established in the 1840s on the northern shore of the Richmond River, 20 kilometres south of Cape Byron, Australia&#x27;s most easterly point. HMS &quot;Rainbow&quot;, commanded by Capt. Henry Rous, first sailed into the Richmond River in 1828, followed by overland settlers from the Clarence River. In 1842, more settlers arrived on a ship called &quot;Sally,&quot; forming a settlement at what is now East Ballina on Shaws Bay. 

A lighthouse, Richmond River Light, was first constructed in Ballina in 1866, which served as a significant port in the region. The temporary lighthouse was replaced with the current one, designed by James Barnet, in 1879, and first lit in 1880. It is still active. A branch railway line connected Ballina with the Murwillumbah railway line railway at Booyong. The line was opened on 24 August 1930 and closed on 12 January 1949.

===Landfalls===

Ballina has a number of famous &quot;landfalls&quot; associated with it. In 1928, Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s plane, the &quot;Southern Cross&quot;, crossed the coast over Ballina after its epic journey across the Pacific Ocean. Ballina had a festival associated with the event during the 1970s and 1980s, and a school in East Ballina bears the name &quot;Southern Cross&quot;.

In 1973, the Las Balsas rafts were towed into Ballina by fishing trawlers after their journey from Ecuador. One of the rafts is preserved in the Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum. They had planned to arrive in Mooloolaba in Queensland, but currents forced them off their course. Their journey was almost twice as long as the &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; expeditions of 1947 and proved that people could have travelled across the Pacific in ancient times.

== Heritage listings ==
Ballina has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 37 Norton Street: Brundah

==Location==
It is approximately north of Sydney and south of Brisbane. Ballina is a coastal town and is connected to the Pacific Highway which now bypasses it.

The Richmond River was an important transport route for the region for the first 100 years after settlement. The river and its estuaries abound with marine wildlife and provide for recreational fishing and water sports.

==Demographics==
The population of Ballina township was 18,532 at the 2021 Census (representing 40 percent of the Ballina Shire population of 46,296). The urban area had a population of 46,190, which includes Lennox Head and other suburban areas.

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.3% of the population; compared with the national and state average of 2.9%.

The most common ancestries in the area were English 31.2%, Australian 28.3%, Irish 10.9%, Scottish 8.7% and German 3.2%. 81.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.4%, New Zealand 1.7%, Scotland 0.5% and South Africa 0.4%. 13.3% of people had both parents born overseas. 88.7% of people only spoke English at home.

The most common responses for religion in the area were No Religion 30.2%, Catholic 23.0% and Anglican 19.6%.

Ballina serves as a tourism gateway to the close by destinations of Lismore and Byron Bay. The town has access to several beaches, such as Shelly, Lighthouse, Angels, Flat Rock and Sharpes beaches.

It is also home to historical sites such as the Ballina Manor and the Ballina Naval and Maritime Museum, however its most famous landmark is the &quot;Big Prawn&quot;.

==The Big Prawn ==

Ballina is home to the world&#x27;s largest prawn model (made of concrete and fibreglass). On 24 September 2009, Ballina Shire Council voted to allow the demolition of the Big Prawn, but this permission was never acted upon. Bunnings Warehouse purchased the site and refurbished the Prawn as part of the redevelopment. The Prawn now sits on a stand next to the entrance of the Bunnings Warehouse car park. 

The Ballina Prawn festival ran from 2013–2017, featuring performances from Kav Temperley of Eskimo Joe, Simon Doe and Painted Dice, indie-rock band Hot Compost, and the late Howie Hughes singing his &#x27;Prawn Song, For The Ballina Prawn Festival&#x27;. 

In March 2018, Google Maps&#x27; facial recognition software blurred out the facial area of the Prawn, first noticed on Reddit Australia, and later reported in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

There is an ongoing &quot;Prawn War&quot; between the two Big Prawns with another being in Exmouth, Western Australia; the Big Prawn in Ballina is significantly larger but Exmouth locals say theirs is more realistic.

==Climate==
The town of Ballina experiences a humid subtropical climate (Koppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), typical of the central part of Australia&#x27;s eastern coast. Summers are sultry, humid and rainy, with approximately 40% of the town&#x27;s total annual precipitation occurring from December to March, with March being the wettest month of the year, receiving an average of of precipitation. Ballina&#x27;s annual precipitation total observes a considerably higher concentration in the first half of the year (January–June) than the second half of the year (July–December). Ballina&#x27;s wetness is due to the town&#x27;s coastal location and proximity to Cape Byron, the easternmost point in Australia, which means that exposure to moisture-laden frontal systems that develop throughout the year in the Tasman Sea follows accordingly. Ballina experiences a copious of precipitation annually, which is one of the highest annual precipitation levels to be found along the eastern coast of Australia south of the tropical coast of northern Queensland. The all-time highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the town are and on 12 January 2002 and 17 June 1999 respectively.

==Transport==
===Ballina bypass===
The Ballina bypass project upgraded 12.4 km of dual carriageway road, extending from south of Ballina at the intersection of the Bruxner and Pacific highways to north of Ballina at the intersection with Ross Lane at Tintenbar. Twelve kilometres of local roads were also upgraded.

Early works started in April 2008 and substantial works on 16 June 2008. The Cumbalum to Ross Lane section opened in 2011 (the bypass was extended an extra 0.5 km to allow for a better connection to the Tintenbar to Ewingsdale Project) with full completion in mid-2012. The project had its final traffic switch opened to the public in April 2012, allowing for separation of the Pacific Highway and the Bruxner Highway traffic.

<text>The Birmingham Botanical Gardens are a botanical garden situated in Edgbaston, Birmingham, England. The gardens are located south-west of Birmingham city centre at . Designed in 1829, the gardens are Grade II* listed in Historic Englands&#x27;s Register of Parks and Gardens, and retain many original features and layout, which was designed by the landscape gardener and horticulturalist John Claudius Loudon. The site is notable for its range of glasshouses and gardens, which display a wide variety of plants and previously, birds. Birmingham Botanical Gardens is managed by Birmingham Botanical and Horticultural Society, a registered charity. The gardens are open daily to the public with paid admission.

==History==
When Birmingham Botanical and Horticultural Society was formed in 1829, the intention was to develop a botanical garden. The chosen site for Birmingham Botanical Gardens was an 18-acre area of the Calthorpe estate, named Holly Bank Farm. The gardens were designed in 1829 by John Claudius Loudon, a leading garden planner, horticultural journalist and publisher. The aim was to combine a scientific and ornamental garden and arboretum that would include a nursery and market garden for selling plants, fruits and vegetables to help with the gardens&#x27; maintenance costs. Loudon&#x27;s design for the main conservatory was rejected as too expensive, so it was eventually designed by a local manufacturer. It took three years to plan and construct the site, before it was opened to members of the society on 11 June 1832. Further development and planting continued throughout the decade. Due to rising expenditure, the southern part of the gardens was given up in 1844 and would eventually be used as Westbourne Road Leisure Gardens. The layout of the Botanical Gardens has changed very little since Loudon first designed it.

In 1852, the Tropical House was built, to house the tropical water lily, &quot;Victoria amazonica&quot;. This was followed by the construction of the Subtropical House in 1871. In 1884, the present-day Terrace glasshouses replaced the original conservatory and lean-to houses.

Birmingham Botanical Gardens has played a significant role in the dissemination of Loudon&#x27;s ideas in terms of planting and garden layout within the Birmingham area. Between 1833 and 1927, the gardens hosted annual exhibitions of exotic plants, fruits and flowers, which raised local horticultural expertise. In 1910 a zoological collection was introduced with the aim of increasing society membership and this included bears, monkeys, seals and alligators. Although the zoological collection was later abandoned, the gardens&#x27; collection of birds remained a feature until early 2024.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s a £1.8 million refurbishment of the gardens took place, which involved the introduction of several new buildings and the restoration of the glasshouses. An aviary was constructed in 1995, and housed a variety of birds in four different flights. In 2019, the &quot;Taking a Stand!&quot; campaign was announced to restore the octagonal iron bandstand, so it could be used as an all-weather outdoor space for schools and be a platform for music and other events, such as weddings. In April 2021, the bandstand, brought to its 1874 glory, was dedicated as the Peter Sowerby Bandstand, following a donation from the Peter Sowerby Foundation, the bandstand had been redecorated up 18 times in its history. On 10 July 2023, a £13m revamp was announced to restore its four glasshouses under the Growing Our Green Heritage after it was awarded almost £600,000 from the National Lottery Heritage Fund to develop the first phase of the project to due commence in mid-2025 and be completed in 2028, with a further £4.4m available as the programme progresses. In September 2024, proposals were submitted for the restoration of the botanical gardens&#x27; historic glasshouses. In January 2025, the city council of Birmingham, England approved plans to restore the historic glasshouse estate.

== Features ==
Overall, the character of Birmingham Botanical Gardens is that of a Victorian public park set in of landscaped greenery.

The gardens feature four glasshouses, which are tropical, subtropical, Mediterranean and arid glasshouses. There is also an Alpine House and Butterfly House. Running along the south range of glasshouses is the terrace, also known as the Loudon Terrace, which provides views of the Main Lawn, with its range of beds and shrubberies around the perimeter. The Aviary, which was located on the south-east side of the lawn torn down in November 2024, comprised four domed iron flight cages. A sunken Rose Garden can be located on the north side of the now-gone Aviary. A 19th Century Grade II listed, octagonal iron bandstand, designed by F.B. Osborn, is situated on the west side of the lawn. At the north-west corner of the lawn stands an octagonal, pierced-work, cast-iron gazebo, which dates to c. 1850 and was moved to the gardens in the mid 1990s. A Coade stone fountain lies west of the bandstand, which was presented in 1850 and was designed by the Birmingham architect, Charles Edge.

From the west side of the Main Lawn, a network of paths wind north and south, giving access to the other main features around the gardens. To the north east lie the Pinetum, Winter Gardens, the West Lawn and the Herbaceous Border. To the south-east is a rock garden and pool, dating to 1895, Rhododendron Walk and the Ernest &#x27;China&#x27; Wilson Border. At the southernmost section of the gardens are the Azalea Walk, Fern Walk and Woodland Glade laid out 1862. On the west side of the path looping around the Rhododendron Walk is a Conservation Garden created in 1991. South of this, in the southern corner of the gardens, is the Nursery. At the north-west corner of the gardens, is the Curator&#x27;s Lodge, built in the 1960s. In 1999, this was extended to become a study centre. South of this, against the east boundary of the gardens, is a series of three period gardens (Roman, Medieval and Tudor), which were created in 1994. Next to the Roman Garden to the south is a waterfowl pool and further south lies a children&#x27;s playground. A museum is housed in the red-brick, Grade II listed Teulon Cottage, which was designed by Samuel Sanders Teulon. Near the west boundary is a rock garden, which was constructed in 1895 in memory of Sir Hugh Nettlefold, an important benefactor.

==Plants==

Birmingham Botanical Gardens contain over 7,000 different plants from around the world.

The gardens are home to The British National Bonsai Collection, which opened in 1993 and aims to provide both casual visitors and enthusiasts with a comprehensive display of the variations of species and styles of bonsai. One of the oldest specimens is the &quot;Omiya tree&quot;, a 250-year-old &quot;Juniperus chinensis&quot; in the informal upright style, presented to the collection in 1995 by the then city of Omiya, Japan.

Each of the four glasshouses features a different variety of plants. The tropical glasshouse consists of essential crops, such as rice, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton, as well as ornamental and aquatic plants. The subtropical glasshouse features orchids, ferns and carnivorous plants, such as Venus flytraps. The Mediterranean glasshouse provides visitors with a display of citrus trees and shrubs. The arid glasshouse consists of survivalist plants, such as cacti and aloe vera.

There are many unusual and notable plants in the gardens including two fine Himalayan Cedars close to the fountain. These were raised from seeds given to the gardens in the 1840s by James Watt Junior, the son of James Watt whose improvements to the Newcomen steam engine were fundamental to the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution. A plant found nowhere else is the fern &quot;Dicksonia&quot; ×&quot;lathamii&quot; which is a hybrid between &quot;Dicksonia antarctica&quot; and &quot;Dicksonia arborescens&quot;, raised by ex-Curator W. B. Latham more than one hundred years ago.

==Birds==
The gardens were home to a small collection of exotic birds from around the world including white-cheeked turaco, Himalayan monals, azure-winged magpies and Quaker parakeets. The majority of the gardens&#x27; birds were located in the white-domed aviary building that provided a focal point on the main lawn. The aviary consisted of four distinct sections, three of which represented Asia, Africa and the Americas. The Asian section housed colourful tragopans, the African section was home to different varieties of lovebirds, and the American section housed Quaker parakeets. The fourth section consisted of soft-billed birds, such as starlings and Mynah birds. The gardens also feature a wetlands enclosure that contains a variety of ornamental waterfowl. The terrace was the location for the gardens’ parrots, including a sulphur-crested cockatoo named Jenny that entertained visitors with her chatter, and Lionel, a blue macaw. In early 2024, the birds were moved elsewhere and the aviary was demolished in November 2024.

==Facilities==
Birmingham Botanical Gardens features a gift shop, plant sales centre, tea room, meeting and conference facilities, and five event suites, including the Loudon, Garden and Terrace Suites.

There are two playground areas for children, a traditional playground with swings and slide and a children&#x27;s discovery garden where children can learn about plants through interactive play.

==Education==
The gardens serve schools, colleges, nurseries and youth groups in the West Midlands and beyond with outdoor educational visits. The education programme includes cross-curricular teaching sessions. Schools are able to use the purpose-built education building called the Study Centre. The Centre also hosts a variety of leisure courses for adults, including photography, nature and heritage courses.

==Events==
There is an all-year events programme at the gardens that includes activity sessions for youngsters, garden tours, family activities, photography and art classes, theatre, music and falconry.

<doc id="613766" wikidata="Q317265" url="?curid=613766" title="Mark Williams (snooker player)">
<text>Mark James Williams (born 21 March 1975) is a Welsh professional snooker player who is a three-time World Champion, winning in 2000, 2003 and 2018. Often noted for his long potting ability, Williams has earned the nickname &quot;The Welsh Potting Machine&quot;, and is regarded as one of the greatest snooker players of all time.

Williams turned professional in 1992 and has been ranked the world number one player three times (1999–00, 2000–01 and 2002–03). His most successful season to date was 2002–03, when he won the Triple Crown: the UK Championship, the Masters and the World Championship. In doing so, he became only the third player, after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, to win all three Triple Crown events in one season. He is the first, and to date, the only player to win all three versions of the professional World Championship: the World Snooker Championship, the Six-red World Championship and the World Seniors Championship.

The first left-handed player to win the World Championship, Williams has won 26 ranking tournaments, including two UK Championships (1999 and 2002), making him sixth on the all-time list. He has also won the Masters on two occasions (1998 and 2003). His form began to decline after his second World Championship title in 2003; he then dropped out of the top 16 following the 2007–08 season, but he regained his place for 2009–10. Williams has compiled over 600 century breaks in professional competition, including three maximum breaks. Winning the 2024 Tour Championship aged 49 years and 17 days made him the second-oldest player—after Ray Reardon—to win a professional ranking tournament.

He is one of the group of three players known as the &quot;Class of &#x27;92&quot; who all turned professional during the 1992–93 snooker season. The other two are Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and John Higgins.

==Career==

===Early career===
Williams was born in Cwm, near Ebbw Vale, in the Welsh county of Gwent (now the county borough of Blaenau Gwent). He started playing snooker at an early age and won his first junior event when he was eleven years old; it was then that he realised that he wanted to pursue a career as a snooker player. He scored his first century break when he was thirteen, and had achieved his first 147 break by the time he was eighteen. As a schoolboy, he was also a promising amateur boxer, remaining undefeated in twelve fights. He was encouraged to play snooker by his father Dilwyn, who was a coal miner. At the age of fifteen, Williams did a 12-hour shift down the mines.

Williams finished his first season ranked 119th; three years later, he was ranked in the world&#x27;s top 16 for the 1996–97 season. His first ranking tournament win came in January 1996, when he won the 1996 Welsh Open title, beating John Parrott 9–3 in the final. After failing to qualify for the 1996 World Championship, he won the first ranking event of the new season in October 1996, the Grand Prix, beating surprise finalist Euan Henderson 9–5. In April 1997, he went on to win the British Open, beating Stephen Hendry 9–2 in the final. He also beat Hendry in a &quot;thrilling&quot; final in February 1998, to take his first Masters title, winning 10–9 in a black-ball finish in the deciding frame, after recovering from 6–9 down. At the 1997 World Championship, he was drawn against his coach Terry Griffiths, who was making his last appearance at the Crucible as a player; Williams eventually beat Griffiths 10–9 on the black, but then lost 8–13 to Hendry in the last 16. He reached the semi-finals of the 1998 World Championship, losing 14–17 to Ken Doherty. The following year, at the 1999 World Championship, he made it through to the final and finished the tournament as runner-up to Hendry, losing the final 1118.

===1999–2004===
The 1999–00 season was a very successful one for Williams who won the 1999 UK Championship and the 2000 World Championship. These results, along with another ranking title at the 2000 Thailand Masters and three runner-up positions, allowed him to capture the world number one position for the first time. At the 1999 UK Championship he defeated Stephen Hendry 96 in the semi-final before defeating Matthew Stevens 108 in the final. In the 2000 World Championship final he came from 7–13 behind against his fellow countryman Stevens to eventually win 18–16. With the victory he became the first left-handed player to win the World Championship at The Crucible. He also produced a notable comeback in his semi-final match against John Higgins, coming from 1014 down to win 17–15. Williams won only one ranking event in the 2000–01 snooker season, the 2000 Grand Prix, with a 9–5 victory over Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the final, but he was a runner-up in two other ranking events, the 2000 UK Championship, where he lost 410 to Higgins in the final, and the 2000 China Open, where he was beaten 39 by O&#x27;Sullivan. This was enough for him to retain his number one ranking, although his title defence at the 2001 World Championship ended in the second round with a 12–13 defeat to Joe Swail.

In the 2001–02 season, Williams also only won one ranking tournament, as he struggled to find his best form from previous seasons, winning the 2002 China Open, where he defeated Anthony Hamilton 9–8 from 5–8 down in the final. However, he then lost to Hamilton 9–13 in the second round of the 2002 World Championship and the number one ranking to O&#x27;Sullivan.

The 2002–03 season was exceptional for Williams as he won all three Triple Crown events, the 2002 UK Championship, 2003 Masters and the 2003 World Championship. This made him only the fourth player after Hendry, Davis and John Higgins to hold these titles simultaneously, and only the third player after Davis and Hendry to have won them all in one season. These results enabled him to reclaim the number one spot at the end of the season. He became just the second player, after Ray Reardon, to reclaim the number one ranking. In the UK Championship final he beat Ken Doherty 10–9, and in the Masters he beat Hendry 10–4. Before the 2003 World Championship he had a scare with his cue when it was damaged and bent on his flight with Ryanair to play in the Irish Masters, but he had it repaired before the tournament.

On his way to winning the 2003 World title, he had a relatively untroubled route to the final with wins over Stuart Pettman 10–2, Quinten Hann 13–2, Hendry 13–7 and Stephen Lee 17–8 before facing Doherty in the final. He led 10–2, and looked to be heading for an emphatic victory, before Doherty fought back to 16–16. Williams regained his composure under intense pressure to win the last two frames and lift the trophy for the second time.

The following season, he lost in the first round of the 2003 UK Championship to Fergal O&#x27;Brien, a match which ended his record run of 48 tournaments in which he had won his first match. In February, he was unable to defend his title at the 2004 Masters. He beat Stevens in the first round but then lost a close match to Paul Hunter 56 in the quarter-final. His defence at the 2004 World Championship started with a 10–7 win over Dominic Dale, but he lost 11–13 in the second round to Joe Perry, and he endured a run of poor form over the 2004–05 season, dropping to ninth in the world rankings for the 2005–06 season.

===2005–2009===
On 20 April at the 2005 World Snooker Championship, Williams became the first Welshman and the fifth player in history to score a maximum break at the Crucible Theatre in the World Championship. This came in the final frame of a 10–1 first round victory over Robert Milkins, but he then lost in the second round to Ian McCulloch 12–13.

On 26 March 2006, Williams won his 16th ranking event, his first in two and a half years, at the 2006 China Open in Beijing, beating John Higgins 9–8 in the final. This helped him return to the top eight in the world rankings, after a dramatic fall in the provisional rankings which saw him facing a possible drop out of the top 16. He also showed good form in the 2006 World Championship, beating Anthony Hamilton 10–1 and Mark Selby 13–8 to set up a quarter-final clash with Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, the first time the two had met at the Crucible. The match was given extra tension considering they had been rivals (although O&#x27;Sullivan has since said that the former feud has been replaced by friendship and respect). In a close-fought match, O&#x27;Sullivan eventually won 13–11. It was revealed during that tournament that Williams had split with coach Terry Griffiths. The two remained very close friends, but Griffiths would no longer be coaching him. In late 2007, Williams returned to having Griffiths as his coach.

On 2 September 2006, Williams won the Pot Black trophy, after compiling a century break (119) in the final against Higgins. However, Williams had perhaps the worst season of his career in 2006–07, losing his first match in several tournaments, including the 2007 World Championship, where he lost 910 to Joe Swail. However, he retained his top 16 place, mainly through the ranking points he had earned the previous season.

His first win of the 2007–08 season came in the 2007 Grand Prix with a 4–3 win over Ian McCulloch, but he still failed to qualify for the last 16 of the event and was outside the top 32 on the provisional ranking list.

At the 2007 UK Championship, he showed a return to some form. He beat Ricky Walden comfortably 9–3 in the last 32, and in the last 16 he faced Mark Allen who he trailed 0–4 and 1–5. However, Williams produced a comeback to win eight successive frames and he won the match 9–5. In the quarter-finals, Stephen Maguire was too strong and beat him 9–5.

After a 2–6 first round loss to Ken Doherty in the 2008 Masters, Williams revealed he was considering retirement from the game if he dropped out of the top 32 and was forced to play in all the qualifying competitions, although then only 32 years old. But he also claimed at the 2008 Welsh Open at Newport that this statement had been blown out of proportion, and that he would remain a professional. He began to show more consistency for the remainder of the season, reaching the last 16 of three ranking events and a run to the quarter-finals of the 2008 China Open, but he could not reach his first semi-final for two years, losing 3–5 to Ryan Day. At the 2008 World Championship he defeated Mark Davis; however, a 7–13 defeat to O&#x27;Sullivan in the second round forced him out of the top 16, pushing him into the qualifiers for 2008/2009. On 8 July 2008 it was announced that Williams had split from his management company 110 Sport, following O&#x27;Sullivan and Maguire.

In the 2008–09 season, he reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 Shanghai Masters and 2008 UK Championship, but also suffered three qualifying defeats. At he UK Championship his form inproved as he beat Mark Selby and Graeme Dott 9–7, before losing narrowly 8–9 to Ali Carter. He also qualified for the 2009 World Championship but lost 7–10 to Stephen Hendry after leading 7–5. During the end of the match he suffered some trouble with his tip. However, he had done enough to return to the top 16 at the end of the season.

===2009–10 season===
The 2009–10 season started badly when Williams broke his wrist in a fall at home, less than a month before the 2009 Shanghai Masters, the first ranking event of the season. He played in Shanghai despite the injury, but wore a cast on his wrist. There he won his first round match against Joe Swail 5–3, but lost in the next round against John Higgins 1–5. In the 2009 Grand Prix he secured wins over Stuart Bingham, Stephen Hendry and Robert Milkins on his way to the semi-finals. Despite making a break of 142 (the highest break of the tournament) in the first frame against Ding Junhui, he lost 1–6.

At the 2009 UK Championship he led Graeme Dott 6–2, before Dott retired due to illness and Williams thus won the match 9–2. After this he lost his next match against Peter Lines 8–9 in the last 16. At the 2010 Masters he won his wild card round match, beating Rory McLeod 6–2. Then he won his first round match against Ali Carter 6–3 to progress to the quarter-finals of the event, despite being involved in a traffic accident the day before his match against Carter. It was reported that a car drove into the back of the 4×4 that his sponsors had lent him, which was carrying Williams and Hendry to a restaurant. In the quarter-finals he defeated Shaun Murphy 6–4, but eventually lost a high-quality match in the semi-final 5–6 against Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. In the 2010 Welsh Open, he reached the quarter-finals, beating Fergal O&#x27;Brien 5–2 and Andrew Higginson 5–0, before losing against Stephen Maguire 1–5.

After these signs of form, in April 2010 he won his first ranking tournament in four years – the 2010 China Open. On his way he beat Jamie Cope 5–3, the then reigning world champion John Higgins 5–2, Marco Fu 5–1, and Ali Carter 6–4, setting up a clash with Ding Junhui in the final. Trailing 3–5 at one stage, Williams eventually won the match 10–6. This was his 17th ranking event win and his third China Open. After his victory, Williams said: &quot;I&#x27;m over the moon to win again. It&#x27;s been a long time coming but I&#x27;ve kept working hard and I felt that in the end the results would come.&quot;

At the 2010 World Championship, Williams defeated Marcus Campbell 10–5 in the first round, but lost his second-round match against O&#x27;Sullivan 10–13. He finished the season ranked eighth.

===2010–11 season===
Williams opened the season by winning the first event of the Players Tour Championship by defeating Stephen Maguire 4–0 in the final, a new addition to the snooker calendar introduced by Barry Hearn, a series of events that Williams has supported. Williams finished 6th on the Players Tour Championship Order of Merit.

In the 2010 Shanghai Masters Williams won his first round match against Ricky Walden 5–3, but lost narrowly in the second round against Graeme Dott 4–5. He then reached the semi-finals of the 2010 World Open, where he lost 2–3 against eventual winner Neil Robertson.

He was selected to compete in the 2010 Premier League, due to his success from the previous season, the first time he has competed in the event for five years, but failed to reach the semi-finals. At the 2010 UK Championship he reached the final, his run including a 9–8 victory over Shaun Murphy in the semi-final after trailing 6–8, but lost against John Higgins 9–10 in the final, after leading 7–2, 8–4 and 9–5 at some points of the match, as well as leading the 17th frame by 29 points with only the colours remaining, meaning Higgins needed a snooker to stay in the match. Williams&#x27;s next tournament was the 2011 Masters, where he lost 4–6 in the first round against Ding Junhui. Williams won the first ranking event of 2011, the 2011 German Masters, by defeating Mark Selby 9–7 in the final. At the 2011 China Open Williams lost in the first round 4–5 against Stephen Lee, despite making four centuries.

At the 2011 World Snooker Championship, Williams defeated Ryan Day 10–5 in the first round, and Jamie Cope 13–4 in the second round. He then won his quarter-final against Mark Allen 13–5, and in doing so he reached the semi-final stage for the first time since 2003, but lost 14–17 against Higgins. As a result of Selby&#x27;s exit from the tournament Williams became the new world number one after the event.

===2011–12 season===
At the 2011 World Cup, Williams was partnered with Matthew Stevens to represent Wales, and they reached the semi-finals, losing 1–4 against China. Williams then reached the final of the 2011 Australian Goldfields Open, but lost 8–9 against Stuart Bingham, after leading 8–5 at one point of the match. Williams also lost from a winning position in the final of the next major ranking event, the 2011 Shanghai Masters. His run included a 6–5 win over Neil Robertson in the semi-final, and he led Mark Selby 9–7 in the final, but lost the last three frames to lose 9–10. The defeat also meant that Selby took the world number one spot from Williams. He was beaten in the last 16 of the 2011 UK Championship by Ricky Walden and reached the quarter-finals in his defence of the 2012 German Masters, where he succumbed 3–5 to Stephen Lee. Williams suffered a 1–5 defeat to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the second round of the 2012 China Open.

Williams played in 11 of the 12 PTC events throughout the season, but could only reach the last 32 two times, in Event 10 and Event 11. He was ranked 82nd in the PTC Order of Merit, comfortably outside the top 24 who made the Finals.

Williams caused a degree of controversy ahead of the World Championship by stating on his Twitter page that he &quot;hates&quot; the tournament&#x27;s venue, the Crucible Theatre, and hopes it will be played in China soon. He also swore when describing the Grade II listed building. A spokesman from the WPBSA confirmed a statement would be released regarding the matter. Williams was drawn to play Liu Chuang in the first round and won 10–6 to set up a second round clash with O&#x27;Sullivan which he lost 6–13. The result meant that Williams had failed to beat O&#x27;Sullivan in over 10 years in ranking events. Williams ended the season ranked world number 3. It was revealed by World Snooker that Williams had been fined a total of £4,000 for his comments made before the World Championship.

===2012–13 season===

Williams first ranking event of the 2012–13 season was the 2012 Wuxi Classic, where he beat Tom Ford and Mark Allen, before losing 3–5 to Marcus Campbell in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He went one better at the 2012 Shanghai Masters by seeing off Mark Davis, Ricky Walden and Joe Perry to face Judd Trump in the semi-finals. Trump was 5–1 up and on a break of 53 for the match, but Williams came back to trail 4–5 before losing the next frame to come up short of completing a comeback, and Trump beat Williams 6–4. Williams then suffered a huge dip in form as he lost in the first round of six successive ranking events; after his defeat to Mark King in the 2012 UK Championship he suggested that he was contemplating retirement.

During his string of defeats he did beat Matthew Stevens in the non-ranking 2013 Masters from 1–4 down (Stevens also missed a pot for 5–1), but then lost 1–6 to eventual champion Mark Selby. At the 2013 China Open in March Williams won his first match in a ranking event since September with a 5–2 victory against Lü Haotian and continued his run by defeating Ali Carter 5–4, before losing 1–5 to Selby in the quarter-finals. At the 2013 World Championship he lost 6–10 to debuting compatriot Michael White in the first round and admitted afterwards that the season had been one he would be looking forward to forgetting, but he was committed to playing next year. His poor season saw him drop 12 places in the rankings to world number 15.

===2013–14 season===

In July 2013 he won the Rotterdam Open, defeating Mark Selby 4–3 in the final. This was Williams&#x27;s second title in a Players Tour Championship event. However, he had a poor season in the ranking events as he failed to reach a single quarter-final for the first time since the 2006–07 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He did earn an encouraging 4–3 win over world number one Neil Robertson at the 2014 Welsh Open; Williams said afterwards that he was glad he had ignored his friend Stephen Hendry&#x27;s advice to retire and believed he still had ranking event titles left in him. He had chances to move 3–0 ahead in the last 16 against Marco Fu, but eventually lost 2–4; afterwards he said that the Williams who won two world titles over 10 years ago was &quot;dead&quot;. In the qualifying rounds for the 2014 World Championship, Williams lost 8–10 to Alan McManus, meaning he was absent from the tournament for the first time since 1996. Williams finished the campaign as the world number 18, the first time he had ended the season outside the top 16 in six years.

===2014–15 season===

Williams lost in the second round of his first two ranking events of the 2014–15 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His first quarter-final of the campaign was at the 2014 International Championship and he trailed Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 0–3, before winning five successive frames with a high break of 120. The match went into a deciding frame, which Williams won to beat the five-time world champion for the first time in 12 years. His semi-final match against Mark Allen also went all the way, after Williams had been 4–7 down, and a miss on the final red proved crucial as he was defeated 8–9. He was beaten 2–6 by Stephen Maguire in the third round of the 2014 UK Championship.

After knocking out Judd Trump 4–1 to reach the quarter-finals of the 2015 Welsh Open, Williams said that he no was longer expecting to win tournaments and was more concerned with improving his ranking. He then made two centuries in defeating Marco Fu 5–1 to play in the semi-finals of the event for the first time since 2003. Williams took advantage of Ben Woollaston missing chances to send their match into a deciding frame after he had been 3–5 behind, but lost it to just fall short of reaching the final in his home tournament. Williams won through to the final of the minor-ranking Gdynia Open, but was whitewashed 4–0 by Neil Robertson. Despite only being 39 years old, Williams took part in the 2015 World Seniors Championship as he would turn 40 before the end of the season and he won the title by beating Fergal O&#x27;Brien 2–1. Another ranking event semi-final followed at the 2015 Indian Open, where he lost 2–4 to Michael White.

After defeating Thepchaiya Un-Nooh in the first round of the Players Championship Grand Final, Williams produced back-to-back comebacks from 1–3 down to knock out both Mark Selby and Matthew Selt 4–3. He then reached his first major ranking event final in over three years with a 4–2 win over Judd Trump and raced into a 3–0 lead against Joe Perry. However, his highest break in the next four frames was 14 as Perry fought back to triumph 4–3. In a rematch of the 2000 final, Williams played Matthew Stevens in the first round of the 2015 World Championship and was thrashed 10–2.

===2015–16 season===
Williams lost 1–5 to Judd Trump in the quarter-finals of the 2015 Shanghai Masters. He reached the final of the non-ranking 2015 General Cup, where he was defeated 3–7 by Marco Fu.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2015 UK Championship, Williams was knocked out in the second round by Tom Ford 56 after Williams had led 53. He drew Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round of the 2016 Masters and was 4–2 ahead. However, the match went to a deciding frame in which Williams missed a risky plant and lost 5–6. He lost in the fourth round of the 2016 Welsh Open 2–4 to Mark Selby and in the first round of three other ranking events and in qualifying for the 2016 China Open. Williams defeated Graeme Dott 10–4 and Michael Holt 13–8 to reach the quarter-finals of the 2016 World Championship for the first time in five years. However, he was then thrashed 3–13 by Ding Junhui in the quarter-final, with a session to spare.

===2016–17 season===
Williams won a trio of frames to force a decider in the semi-finals of the 2016 Riga Masters against Michael Holt, but missed the final brown to be defeated. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2016 Northern Ireland Open by beating John Higgins 4–1, but then lost 4–5 to Kyren Wilson. He recorded another quarter-final at the 2016 UK Championship, but was beaten 2–6 by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. In the third round of the 2017 China Open, Williams came from 1–4 down to eliminate Higgins 5–4 and then defeated Shaun Murphy 5–1. Another comfortable win followed as he beat Hossein Vafaei 6–1 to play Mark Selby in the final. Williams needed to win to break back into the top 16 and avoid having to qualify for the 2017 World Championship. He was 8–7 up, but lost the last three frames to be beaten 8–10, falling short of winning his first ranking event for six years. He made it through to the final World Championship qualifying round, before Stuart Carrington beat him 10–7. Williams therefore missed only his second World Championship since he had made his first appearance at the tournament in 1997.

===2017–18 season===
In September 2017, Williams won the Six-red World Championship after defeating Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 82 in the final in Bangkok. With the scores level at 22, Williams won six consecutive frames to seal the victory. Williams then won his first ranking title after a six-year drought, the 2017 Northern Ireland Open, defeating Chinese rising star Yan Bingtao 9–8 in the final; the victory was emotional for Williams, as he revealed that his wife had been suffering from ill health, and he had considered withdrawing from several tournaments. In the 2018 Masters, he faced Mark Selby in the first round, recovering from 3–5 behind to defeat the incumbent World Champion 6–5. He lost 1–6 to Kyren Wilson in the quarter-finals.

Williams qualified for the 2018 German Masters and lost the first two frames of his first-round match against Fergal O&#x27;Brien but made a comeback to win 5–3, He then defeated Matthew Selt 5–2 and Jimmy Robertson 5–3 to reach the semi-finals. There, he recorded breaks of 109, 68 and 51 in defeating Judd Trump 6–1 to reach the final, where he faced Graeme Dott. In the final, Williams was dominant, making six breaks over 50 and one century, a 110 in the eighth frame. Dott won the third frame to trail 1–2, compiling a break of 64 after an earlier 56 by Williams, but did not win another, as Williams claimed a 9–1 victory.

Williams advanced to the semi-finals of the 2018 World Championship, and before his match with Barry Hawkins in the semi-final said that he would do his press conference naked as the world champion if he won. Hawkins would prove to be Williams&#x27;s most difficult opponent of the tournament: Williams levelled the match at 15–15 and secured the lengthy, hard-fought frames needed to win at the eleventh hour. Williams reached his first World Championship final since 2003 facing his fellow &quot;Class of &#x27;92&quot; member, John Higgins. The match was described as one of the best finals in the history of the tournament, Williams winning 18–16 to claim his third World Championship making him (aged 43 at the time) the oldest winner since Reardon, who was 45 in 1978. (Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won his sixth world title in 2020, aged 44, meaning that Williams is now the third-oldest winner of a world title in the modern era.) It also marked 15 years since his last title, making it the largest time span between consecutive titles. Following victory, Williams thanked his late sponsor Ron Skinner, who had died two months earlier, his wife for convincing him not to retire, and coach Stephen Feeney for turning his game around so dramatically from a year ago. As promised, Williams appeared naked at his later press conference,
but was instructed to wear a towel.

===2018–19 season===
As world champion, Williams won the second event of the new season, the 2018 World Open. After recovering from 0–3 behind in his quarter-final against Jack Lisowski to win 5–3, he than came back from 2–5 down in his semi-final against Noppon Saengkham to win 6–5. In the final against David Gilbert, Williams again recovered from a sizeable deficit of 5–9 to win the match 10–9. At the 2018 UK Championship, Williams reached the last-16 where he took a 40 lead over Stephen Maguire but ended up losing 56 after Maguire made a comeback. At the 2019 Masters, Williams lost 36 to Neil Robertson, having led 31. At the 2019 World Championship, Williams&#x27;s defence of his world title ended in the second round, with a 9–13 loss to Gilbert.

===2019–20 season===
Williams began the 2019–20 season positioned third in the world rankings. In early September, he reached the semi-finals of the 2019 Six-red World Championship, where he lost 5–7 to John Higgins. He later reached the final of the 2019 China Championship; having been 5–9 behind to Shaun Murphy, Williams won four frames to force a deciding frame, which he lost.

During the 2019 UK Championship, Williams commented on Twitter that he was not enjoying snooker. He lost 2–6 to Michael White in the second round. He decided not to travel to China to defend his World Open title, and also opted not to play in any of the Home Nations Series tournaments, but he still ended 2019 as world number two. At the 2020 World Championship, Williams reached the quarter-final where he played Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Williams took a 72 lead but ultimately lost the match 1013.

===202021 season===

Williams lost in the first round of the 2021 Masters with a 46 defeat to Shaun Murphy. In March, Williams won the 2021 WST Pro Series to win his twenty third ranking title. At the 2021 World Championships, Williams defeated long-term rival John Higgins 137 in the second round before losing 313 in the quarter-final to Mark Selby.

===202122 season===
In August 2021 Williams won his twenty fourth ranking title after defeating Gary Wilson 64 in the final of the British Open. At the 2021 UK Championship, Williams lost 56 to Anthony Hamilton in the second round after reportedly falling asleep during the match. At the 2022 Masters, Williams led Neil Robertson 53 in the semi-final, but Robertson fought back to win, including getting the two snookers that he required to win the final frame. Williams reached the semi-final of the 2022 World Championships where he came from 512 down to level his match at 1616 with Judd Trump, but Trump won the final frame to reach the final. Williams hit sixteen centuries during the tournament to equal Stephen Hendry&#x27;s record for centuries in a single World Championship.

==Playing style==
Williams has been described by some snooker pundits as one of the greatest long potters in the game. He has compiled more than 600 competitive centuries during his professional career, and is 9th on the all-time list of century makers; this is despite his tendency to play exhibition shots, or to miss on purpose, when he knows that the frame is won. He is also well known for his ability to win &quot;scrappy&quot; frames, using his tactical play and by picking out .

An unusual aspect of Williams&#x27;s playing style is a tendency to position his cue directly underneath his body instead of using the rest, a technique that he often brings into play once a frame is secure. He is partially colour blind and has difficulty distinguishing between the red and brown balls; on one occasion, he potted a brown ball believing it to be red.

Over the course of his career, Williams has earned the nicknames &quot;Sprog&quot;, the &quot;Welsh Potting Machine&quot;, and &quot;The Welsh Wonder&quot;.

==Personal life==
Williams is also a keen poker player and golfer. He is proud of his Welsh heritage, and has a tattoo depicting the Welsh Dragon eating the English flag. He is a keen Manchester United supporter. Williams and his wife Joanne have three sons: Connor (born April 2004), Kian (born 2007) and Joel (born 2013). He is good friends with fellow snooker professionals Matthew Stevens, Jackson Page and Stephen Hendry, as well as boxer Joe Calzaghe. Williams was awarded an MBE in June 2004.

<text>Bruxner Highway, and its former western alignment as Bruxner Way, are a state highway and rural road respectively, located in New South Wales, Australia. The route forms an east–west link across the Northern Tablelands in northern New South Wales, close to the border with Queensland, to the Northern Rivers coast. It was named after Michael Bruxner, NSW Minister for Transport from 1932 to 1941.

==Route==
Bruxner Way commences at the intersection with Newell Highway in Boggabilla and heads in a south-easterly direction, tracking close to the southern bank of the Macintyre River until it reaches Yetman, then heads east where it reaches the turn-off to Texas (just across the border in Queensland), then continues in an easterly direction, tracking close to the southern bank of the Dumaresq River and Tenterfield Creek until it eventually terminates at an intersection with New England Highway just north of Tenterfield. Bruxner Highway commences at the intersection with Newell Highway in central Tenterfield and continues in an easterly direction through Tabulam until it reaches Casino, where it meets Summerland Way. The highway continues east through Lismore and Alstonville until eventually terminating at an interchange with Pacific Highway in West Ballina.

The speed limits along Bruxner Highway are mostly 100 km/h with 80 km/h on windy sections and 50 km/h in urban areas. The speed limit is 60 km/h through the Lismore urban area with a high volume of traffic. There is a speed camera in the 80 km/h section near the Lismore City and Ballina Shire boundary.

==History==

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 63 was declared from Yetman to Boggabilla (and continuing northwards to the state border with Queensland at Goondiwindi, and southwards via Warialda and Bingara to the intersection with Great Northern Highway, today New England Highway, at Tamworth, Main Road No. 64 was declared from the intersection with North Coast Highway (today Pacific Highway) at Ballina, via Lismore and Casino to the intersection with Great Northern Highway at Tenterfield, and Main Road No. 138 was declared from Tenterfield via Bonshaw to the state border with Queensland at Texas. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to Trunk Roads 63 and 64 and Main Road 138 on 8 April 1929. Main Road 138 was later extended westwards from Texas to meet Trunk Road 63 at Yetman, with a branch to the state border with Queensland at Texas, on 22 January 1935.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 16 on 16 March 1938, from the intersection with Pacific Highway at Ballina via Lismore, Casino, Tabluam, Tenterfield, Bonshaw, Yetman and Boggabilla to the state border with Queensland at Goondiwindi, subsuming Trunk Road 64, and most of Main Road 138 from Yetman to Tenterfield; the southern end of Trunk Road 63 was truncated to meet Bruxner Highway at Yetman, and Main Road 138 was truncated from the bridge over the Dumaresq River at Texas to the intersection with Bruxner Highway, as a result. State Highway 16 was named Bruxner Highway on 2 November 1959, in honour of Sir Michael Bruxner, member for Northern Tablelands and Tenterfield from 1920 to 1962, leader of the New South Wales Country Party for almost all that period and Deputy Premier and Minister for Transport from 1932 to 1941.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, the declaration of Highway 16 from West Ballina was truncated at Tenterfield, and Main Road 462 was declared along the former alignment from Tenterfield via Bonshaw and Yetman to Boggabilla, on 23 April 2010. Main Road 462 was named Bruxner Way in 2011, however much of the road still shows signage as Bruxner Highway, and few signs have been replaced stating its new identity. Bruxner Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 16, from the intersection with New England Highway in Tenterfield to the intersection with Pacific Highway in West Ballina.

Bruxner Highway was signed National Route 44 in 1974, between Ballina and Tenterfield. It was intended that National Route 44 continued to Boggabilla to meet with Newell Highway, however this part of the highway was never signed as National Route 44. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B60 between Ballina and Tenterfield.

===Upgrades===
At Alstonville, a 6.5km-long bypass was completed in 2010 at the cost of $44 million. There is a proposal for a fully duplicated highway from the interchange with Pacific Highway to Lismore Airport.

<text>Boggabilla is a small town in the far north of inland New South Wales, Australia in Moree Plains Shire. At the , the town had a population of 529, of which 43.5% identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent.

The name Boggabilla comes from Gamilaraay &quot;bagaaybila&quot;, literally &quot;full of creeks&quot;. The same &quot;creek&quot; element is found in the name of Boggabri.

== Geography ==
Boggabilla is located on the southern bank of the Macintyre River, north of Moree. The Newell Highway passes through Boggabilla and is met by the Bruxner Way at a junction in the centre of town. Surrounding localities include Toomelah Station to the east, while the larger town of Goondiwindi is northwest, across the border in Queensland.

==History==
The Boggabilla region is situated roughly on the border of two large language groups of Aboriginal Australians, the Bigambul and the northern clans of the Gamilaraay. British colonisation had a devastating effect on these people, with many being killed in frontier conflict and the Bigambul language now being extinct.

The first British to enter the region were squatter pastoralists who started to take land in the early 1840s. Around 1843, George Yeomans and Otto Baldwin formed the Boggabilla pastoral station. They and their stockmen skirmished with the local Aboriginal men over occupation of the land and it wasn&#x27;t until the arrival of the government funded Native Police force under Commandant Frederick Walker in 1849 that armed Aboriginal resistance around Boggabilla was put down.

The township of Boggabilla was formed and allotments were first offered for sale in 1863.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 529 in Boggabilla.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 43.5% of the population. 
* About 63.5% of people were born in Australia and 65.4% of people only spoke English at home.
* 56.2% identified as Christian and 28.5% identified as having no religious affiliation.

== Transport ==
Boggabilla used to have a railway service, but this has been cut back to North Star, New South Wales, where the last silo is located. Also, an airport and shuttle services are available to Sydney from Moree located 110 km south of Boggabilla. Daily bus services run both north and south.

== Health ==
The nurses at Boggabilla Health Centre provide services such as preschool screening and immunisation. 

== Education ==
Boggabilla Central School has preparatory, primary, and secondary grades) and a TAFE (a campus of TAFE NSW).

<text>Texas is a rural town and locality in the Goondiwindi Region of Queensland, Australia. It is on the Queensland border with New South Wales. In the , the locality of Texas had a population of 790 people.

== History ==
Bigambul (also known as Bigambal, Bigumbil, Pikambul, Pikumbul) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by the Bigambul people. The Bigambul language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Goondiwindi Regional Council, including the towns of Goondiwindi, Yelarbon and Texas extending north towards Moonie and Millmerran.

Texas sits on Bigambul land, the Indigenous people of the region who inhabited the area for thousands of years prior to colonisation in the 1840s.

Texas, at one time, relied on its importance of grazing. It was settled in 1842 and was named after the largest nearby landholding in the area, known as Texas Station.
The origin of the town&#x27;s name is generally regarded as a reference to a territorial dispute. The land in the area was first settled by the McDougall brothers, who found squatters there on returning from the goldfields. Once their legal right to the land was recognised, they named their property in honour of the dispute between the United States and Mexico over territory in Texas.

Texas Provisional School opened on 1 March 1887. On 1 January 1900, it became Texas State School.

Land in Texas was open for selection on 17 April 1877; were available.

Texas was connected by the Texas railway line from Inglewood in November 1930 with the town being served by the Texas railway station (). The line was closed in 1994, but officially remains operational. However, the station is officially abandoned.

Up until about 1986, tobacco farming was an important industry in the area and many Italian families settled the area to run and work the tobacco farms. The tobacco industry had begun to be important in the late 1800s. In the 1870s, Chinese workers began to be employed on the Texas Station to grow the crop for local use. &quot;They were employed because they had grown their own tobacco before, so you use somebody who can already grow something instead of reinventing the wheel,&quot; local historian Robyn Griffin explained. &quot;Smoking had become quite fashionable, and they would&#x27;ve also sold some of it to manufacturers.&quot; Later, during the 1900s, much of the region&#x27;s tobacco was grown in the Dumaresq Valley beside the Dumaresq River.

The current Texas Library was opened in 2010 with minor refurbishment in 2011.

== In popular culture ==

After a visit to Texas in 2002, and being involved in a car accident nearby, American Country/Rockabilly recording artist Jason Lee Wilson memorialised the town in a song &quot;TX, QLD, Australia&quot;. The song was included on the Cumberland Runners&#x27; 2004 debut album entitled Music to Haul By.

Previously, James Blundell had written and recorded a song entitled &quot;Texas&quot; as the B-side of his first single on the EMI label (EMI 2165), Cloncurry Cattle Song. On the single the writing credits of the two songs were inadvertently switched, but corrected on Blundell&#x27;s debut, self-titled album (1989). Texas was composed by James Blundell and Doug Trevor, with Blundell and M. Hickson writing Cloncurry Cattle Song.

Lee Kernaghan also referenced the town in his 2002 hit song &quot;Texas, Qld 4385&quot; from his Electric Rodeo album released in 2002.

<text>A sequence-tagged site (or STS) is a short (200 to 500 base pair) DNA sequence that has a single occurrence in the genome and whose location and base sequence are known.

==Usage==
STSs can be easily detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. For this reason they are useful for constructing genetic and physical maps from sequence data reported from many different laboratories. They serve as landmarks on the developing physical map of a genome.

When STS loci contain genetic polymorphisms (e.g. simple sequence length polymorphisms, SSLPs, single nucleotide polymorphisms), they become valuable genetic markers, i.e. loci which can be used to distinguish individuals.

They are used in shotgun sequencing, specifically to aid sequence assembly.

STSs are very helpful for detecting microdeletions in some genes. For example, some STSs can be used in screening by PCR to detect microdeletions in Azoospermia (AZF) genes in infertile men.

<doc id="613782" wikidata="Q114781" url="?curid=613782" title="Silver City Highway">
<text>Silver City Highway is a highway that links Buronga, New South Wales to the Queensland border via Wentworth, Broken Hill, and Tibooburra, in the arid Far West region of New South Wales; a short branch also connects to Calder Highway on the Victorian border at Curlwaa (signed as Calder Highway). The namesake of the highway is derived from the moniker for Broken Hill – the &quot;Silver City&quot; – which the highway travels through. The highway is designated route B79 from Broken Hill to Buronga.

==Route==
The route passes through largely arid terrain, although there are multiple irrigated areas between Buronga and Wentworth in the highway&#x27;s south. There is relatively flat terrain between Wentworth and Broken Hill that forms arid pastures for grazing. Around Broken Hill and a little to the north the Barrier Range is encountered, which is more hill than the rest of the route encountered so far, but not mountainous. North of there the country is once again relatively flat, though there are further hills around Milparinka. Near Tibooburra the terrain becomes a stony desert; this kind of terrain is known in Australia as gibber.

Creeks to the north of Broken Hill are generally crossed straight across the riverbed, whether the road has been sealed or not. There is signage to help drivers gauge depth of the waters if there does happen to be flows after rains. The highway also roughly follows the route Charles Sturt took when he explored the area, during his search to find the fabled inland sea.

===Along the Murray River===

The highway begins at its intersection with Sturt Highway in the town of Buronga in the far south-west of New South Wales. Buronga is located immediately across the Murray River from the city of Mildura in Victoria. From here the highway heads northwesterly through a pocket of farmland at the locality of Mourquong, before turning on a more westerly heading. The road then traverses arid savanna before again reaching the farmland surrounding Dareton. The road takes on the name Tapio Street within the urban area. Continuing west the enters into more farmland at Curlwaa. Here the road comes to a T-intersection where a turn to the west is required to stay on Silver City Highway. The road to the east is also gazetted as a spur of the highway and is signed as Calder Highway, to which it connects a short distance away across the single lane Abbotsford Bridge over the Murray River. Continuing west on the highway, the farmland largely continues the entirety of the short distance to Wentworth. Upon entering Wentworth, the road takes on several names within the town&#x27;s urban area. Firstly it takes on the name Wentworth Street, before turning west at the Sandwych Street intersection and using that name. The highway then crosses the Darling River over a lift-span bridge. At Adams Street the highway then turns north, keeping the name until it leaves the urban area.

===Wentworth to Broken Hill===

Heading north out of Wentworth, the highway enters arid scrublands and it swings northwest towards the Great Darling Anabranch. Once it reaches the normally dry river, it follows the anabranch upstream crossing it at Bunnerungee Bridge. The highway continues to follow the anabranch north, passing nearby several normally dry lakes, including along the shoreline of Popitah Lake. Roughly following the creekbed of Coombah Creek northwards a short distance, the highway then enters the depression of Coombah Lake. The roadway crosses the lakebed atop an embankment. From here the highway re-enters the lakebed and continues along it to its northern extent. To the north of Coombah lake the road passes to the west of similarly dry Kudgee Lake, the roadway then follows the western side of the Pine Creek creekbed crossing it after some distance, then following it along the eastern side much of the remainder of the way Broken Hill. Upon reaching the approaches to Broken Hill, the terrain elevation becomes a little more varied from the very flat journey travelled so far, as this area is part of the Barrier Range. There is no fuel available along this stretch since the Coombah roadhouse permanently closed.

===Within Broken Hill===

On the southern outskirts of Broken Hill, the highway passes Kanandah Road, which forms part of the heavy vehicle bypass. North of Kanandah Road, the highway takes on the name Wentworth Road for a short distance while it curves eastwards. Once it reaches South Broken Hill urban area, the road continues as Patton Street until reach the roundabout at Bonanza Street where it then turns northwards. It passes over a hill between two mines and becomes South Road northward of Gypsum Street. Upon reaching Broken Hill itself; it becomes Crystal Street, and then turns north at Iodide Street. North of Argent Street, Barrier Highway also follows the same route for a few blocks until it leaves westwards at William Street. At the same intersection, Silver City Highway heads eastwards. The highway continues east almost all the way until the edge of the city, where it turns north at Buck Street. It takes on that name for a short distance until it leaves the urban area.

===Broken Hill to the Dingo Fence===
The highway continues a long distance northwards, through very dry country and crossing the occasional creekbed. Eventually it reaches Packsaddle Roadhouse, where fuel and supplies can be purchased; roughly halfway between Broken Hill and the Queensland border. North of Packsaddle the highway continues in the same fashion, although it does pass between some salt lakes. Eventually it reaches the Milparinka area, where the former township can be accessed a short distance off the highway. Further to the north the highway reaches Tibooburra, the only sizable settlement along the route north of Broken Hill. North of Tibooburra it passes through Sturt National Park before reaching its terminus at the Queensland border along the Dingo Fence, at Warri Gate.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). Main Road No. 69 was declared along this road on 8 August 1928, from Wentworth via Broken Hill, Milparinka and Tibooburra to the state border with Queensland; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 69 on 8 April 1929. 

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the New South Wales MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 21 on 16 March 1938, from Cobham Lake via Milparkinka and Tibooburra to the state border with Queensland at Olive Downs (and continuing south via White Cliffs, Wilcannia, Booligal, Hay and Deniliquin to the state border with Victoria at Moama); Trunk Road 69 was truncated to meet State Highway 21 as a result. State Highway 22 was later declared on 24 January 1945, from the intersection with Sturt Highway at Buronga via Wentworth, Broken Hill, Cobham Lake, Milparkinka and Tibooburra to the state border with Queensland at Olive Downs, subsuming Trunk Road 69; the northern end of State Highway 21 was truncated to meet Barrier Highway south of Wilcannia and its former alignment north of Wilcannia was declared as Main Road 435, meeting State Highway 22 at Kayrunnera, as a result.

State Highway 22 was named Silver City Highway on 3 August 1960, with a branch to Abbotsford Bridge over the Murray River at Curlwaa also declared, to meet Calder Highway in Victoria; while this branch is signed Calder Highway, it is officially part of Silver City Highway. The name was decided upon as the road&#x27;s main purpose is to link Broken Hill (the Silver City) to areas north and south of the city. The Broken Hill ore deposit contains a vast amount of silver, lead, and zinc. At one stage the name &quot;Four States Highway&quot; was also considered, as the road connects to Queensland and Victoria at each end, and also to South Australia via Barrier Highway from Broken Hill.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this Act, Silver City Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 22, from the intersection with Sturt Highway at Buronga via Wentworth, Broken Hill, Cobham Lake and Tibooburra to the state border with Queensland at Warri Gate, with a branch to Abbotsford Bridge over the Murray River at Curlwaa.

Silver City Highway was signed National Route 79 between Broken Hill and Curlwaa, and the branch to Curlwaa to Abbotsford Bridge and Calder Highway, in 1955. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B79 between Broken Hill and Buronga; the branch from Curlwaa to Abbotsford Bridge is now unallocated, despite route A79 continuing along Calder Highway in Victoria. The highway north of Broken Hill also remains unallocated.

===Sealing===
The Wentworth to Broken Hill section was sealed in 1969.

Work has been underway since 2011 to seal the remaining 150 km of unsealed highway. In June 2018, the NSW Government announced it was investing $145 million to seal the remaining 209 km of the Cobb and Silver City Highways by 2023. By July 2020 the highway was sealed as far as Tibooburra, and by December 2022, the entire length to the Queensland border was sealed.

<text>Rudolf Stefan Jan Weigl (2 September 1883 – 11 August 1957) was a Polish biologist, physician and inventor, known for creating the first effective vaccine against epidemic typhus. He was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Medicine each year between 1930 and 1934, and from 1936 to 1939.

Weigl worked during the Holocaust to save the lives of countless Jews by developing the vaccine for typhus and providing shelter to protect those suffering under the Nazi Germans in occupied Poland. For his contributions, he was named a Righteous Among the Nations in 2003.

==Life==

Weigl was born in Prerau, which at the time was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, to Austrian parents, of Austro-Moravian descent. When he was a child, his father died in a bicycle accident. His mother, Elisabeth Kroesel, married a Polish secondary-school teacher, Józef Trojnar. Weigl was raised in Jasło, Poland. Although he was a native German speaker, when the family moved to Poland, he adopted the Polish language and culture.

Later, the family moved to Lviv (&quot;Lwów&quot; in Polish, &quot;Lemberg&quot; in German and Yiddish), where in 1907 Weigl graduated from the biology department at the Lwów University, at which he had been a pupil of Professors Benedykt Dybowski (1833–1930) and J. Nusbaum–Hilarowicz (1859–1917). After graduation, Weigl became Nusbaum&#x27;s assistant, and in 1913 he completed his habilitation which effectively gave him tenure. He then received his doctorate degrees in zoology, comparative anatomy, and histology.

After the outbreak of World War I in 1914, Weigl was drafted into the medical service of the Austro-Hungarian army and began research on typhus and its causes. Weigl worked at a military hospital in Przemyśl, where he supervised the Laboratory for the Study of Spotted Typhus from 1918 to 1920. In 1919, he became a member of a military sanitary council in the Polish army. As he began researching and experimenting, he developed a vaccine.

After the invasion of Poland by Germany in 1939, Weigl continued his research and work at an institution in Lwów. There, he was able to increase the production of his typhus vaccine. He spent the next four years in Lwów focusing his research on developing a vaccine for spotted fever. He led and directed the Institute for Typhus and Virus Research based in Lwów. Weigl created a vaccine for spotted fever; the vaccine did not provide full immunity against the disease, but it substantially reduced the symptoms.

During the Nazi German occupation of Poland in World War II, Weigl&#x27;s research attracted the attention of the Nazis. When they occupied Lwów, they ordered him to set up a typhus vaccine production plant at his Institute. Weigl hired several Jewish friends and colleagues for the plant. Weigl employed and protected approximately 2,000 Polish intellectuals, Jews and members of the Polish underground. Many of these people he hired assisted him in his typhus research and experiments with lice. Many of his Jewish associates primarily helped grow the lice and in return, they received food, protection, and doses of the vaccine when it was fully developed. His vaccines were smuggled into ghettos in Lwów and Warsaw, various concentration camps, and even certain Gestapo prisons. It was estimated that Weigl was able to save around 5,000 lives during the Nazis&#x27; reign by employing them in his Institute.

== Vaccine development ==

In 1930, following Charles Nicolle&#x27;s 1909 discovery that lice were the vector of epidemic typhus, and following the work done on a vaccine for the closely related Rocky Mountain spotted fever, Weigl took the next step and developed a technique to produce a typhus vaccine by growing infected lice and crushing them into a vaccine paste. He discovered that a vaccine could be developed from lice stomachs infected with &quot;Rickettsia prowazeki&quot;, the causative agent of typhus in humans. He developed this first version of the vaccine in 1918 and began experimenting on guinea pigs and even human volunteers. He refined this technique over the years until 1933 when he performed large-scale testing to cultivate bacteria and experiment with the lice using a micro-infection strategy.

The method comprised four major steps:
* Growing healthy lice, for about 12 days;
* Injecting them with typhus;
* Growing them more, for 5 additional days;
* Extracting the lice&#x27;s midguts and grinding them into a paste (which was the vaccine).
Growing lice meant feeding them blood, the more human the better. At first he tested his method on guinea pigs, but around 1933 he began large-scale testing on humans, feeding the lice human blood by letting them suck human legs through a screen. This could cause typhus during the latter phase, when the lice were infected. He alleviated this problem by vaccinating the human &quot;injectees&quot;, which successfully protected them from death (though some did develop the disease). Weigl and his wife Zofia Weigl were some of the earliest lice feeders. He developed the disease, but recovered.

The first major application of his vaccine was conducted between 1936 and 1943 by Belgian missionaries in China. Soon, the vaccines were also administered in Africa. The vaccine was dangerous to produce and hard to make on a large scale. Over time, other vaccines were developed that were less dangerous and more economical to produce, including the Cox vaccine developed on egg yolk.

== Later years, death, and legacy ==
Following the border changes in the aftermath of the war, Weigl moved to Kraków in southern Poland. He was appointed chair of the General Microbiology Institute at the Jagiellonian University, and later chair of biology in the medical faculty at the University of Poznań. He retired in 1951, but production of his vaccine continued for several years.

Weigl died on 11 August 1957 in the Polish mountain resort of Zakopane at age 73. He was buried at the historic Rakowicki Cemetery in Kraków.

For Weigl&#x27;s research and work with typhus at Lwów University, Weigl&#x27;s Institute was created in the typhus research department. The institute features prominently in Andrzej Żuławski&#x27;s 1971 film, &quot;The Third Part of the Night&quot;.

== Awards and honors ==
Weigl was continuously nominated for a Nobel Prize in the years 1930–1934 and 1936–1939. Despite these nominations, he never received a Nobel Prize for his vaccine accomplishments or social work.

A half-century after his death, Weigl&#x27;s research, work, and service were recognized by many. In 2003, he was honored as Righteous Among the Nations. This award was given by Israel and commemorated his work for saving countless Jewish lives during World War II.

On 2 September 2021, Google commemorated Weigl&#x27;s 138th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="613787" wikidata="Q3107680" url="?curid=613787" title="Wentworth, New South Wales">
<text>Wentworth is a small border town in the far south west of the state of New South Wales, Australia. It lies at the confluence of Australia&#x27;s two most important rivers, the Darling and the Murray, the latter forming the border with the state of Victoria to the south. The border with the state of South Australia lies approximately to the west. The town of Wentworth is in the local government area of the same name.

==History==
Named after the famous explorer and politician William Charles Wentworth in 1859, the town is to the west (via the Calder Highway) of the Victorian regional city of Mildura. The famous mining city of Broken Hill is to the north along the Silver City Highway.

Moorna Post Office opened on 22 February 1855 and was renamed Wentworth in 1860.

In 1876, Wentworth township was described in the following terms:
::Wentworth is situated on the Darling, about half a mile from the junction, and is plainly visible from the Murray. The township is built on rising ground, and, save in very exceptional seasons, is quite out of reach of flood waters. The population is between 400 and 500. The place appears prosperous and progressive. The trade up the Darling River, and the supply of stores to the stations in the vicinity, form the life-blood of its prosperity. Wentworth possesses a custom-house – a hideous little building resembling a watch-house, and as great an eyesore as the cause of its establishment is an inconvenience and annoyance to trade. The other public buildings are a post and telegraph office, for Wentworth is on the main telegraph line to Adelaide, and a court-house and offices, which are also used for land offices. There is a resident police magistrate, Mr. Richardson ... The two churches in Wentworth are buildings creditable to the town. The Roman Catholic Church is a brick structure, the Protestant Church an edifice of brick and stone... There are three or four stores of considerable size, and several hotels. The Australian Joint Stock Bank has a branch here. The river, which, opposite the town is about the width of the Murray at Echuca, is crossed by a punt.

==Heritage listings==
Wentworth has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 112 Beverley Street: Wentworth Gaol
* 30 Cadell Street: Saint Ignatius School, Wentworth
* Darling Street: St John&#x27;s Anglican Church, Wentworth
* 1122a Low Darling Road: Avoca Homestead Complex

==Railways==
During the late 1800s Wentworth was an important river port; however, like many such towns, its significance faded with the development of the railways. In 1902, the people of Wentworth were lobbying for a railway from Mildura to be built, including a bridge over the Murray River.

The town is nowadays served by NSW TrainLink coach services, connecting it to Broken Hill, from which trains operate to Sydney, and Mildura.

==Floods==

The town has been flooded many times by the two rivers. The most significant was in 1956, when both rivers flooded simultaneously. Local farmers, supplemented by the army and navy, worked for months to build levee banks to hold the water out of the town.

==Visitor attractions==
Wentworth is now an important tourist outback destination and provides a welcome break for those travelling to or from Broken Hill. In addition to its authentic outback charm, the town offers some interesting attractions:

* PS &quot;Ruby&quot; – a restored 1907 side-wheel paddlesteamer
*The 5 yearly Great Wentworth Tractor Rally
*The Wentworth Gaol
*The Perry Sandhills

The Great Wentworth Tractor Rally is a commemoration of the grey &quot;Fergie&quot; tractors that were used to maintain the levee banks and save the town from the 1956 Murray River flood.

Wentworth was a popular destination for &#x27;pokie tour&#x27; bus rides from Adelaide, the capital city of South Australia, prior to the legalisation of poker (gambling) machines in that state.

==Sport==
The town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Sunraysia Football League.

And the Wentworth District Rowing Club has regular regattas and attendance at national and international events. http://www.sunraysiadaily.com.au/story/4598820/gold-edge-to-regatta/

==Notable people==
*Jarrod Brander, Australian rules footballer
*Leal Douglas, actress, lived in Wentworth in the 1930s.
*Derek Eggmolesse-Smith, Australian rules footballer
*Jamie Lawson, Australian rules footballer
*Brian Winton, Australian rules footballer

==Climate==
Wentworth has a Semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) with hot summers and mild winters. Historical maxima and minima are 48.1 °C and −2.8 °C, respectively.

<text>One.Tel was a group of Australian-based telecommunications companies, principally the publicly-listed One.Tel Limited (ACN 068 193 153), established in 1995 soon after deregulation of the Australian telecommunications industry, most of which are currently under external administration by court appointed liquidators.

The company was established by Jodee Rich and Brad Keeling and had high-profile backers such as the Murdoch and Packer families. James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch sat on the board of the company.

One.Tel attempted to create a youth-oriented image to sell their mobile phones and One.Net internet services. It became Australia&#x27;s fourth largest telecommunications company before collapsing in 2001. Rich and Keeling continued to receive $7m in payments shortly before the company entered administration. The Packer and Murdoch families were embarrassed by the failure of the company, especially after it was reported that both James Packer and Lachlan Murdoch had persuaded their fathers to back the company and invest.

The company&#x27;s slogan was &quot;You&#x27;ll tell your friends about One.Tel&quot;, aimed at drawing the connection between the brand and personal communication. The company also had a cartoon mascot known as &quot;The Dude&quot;. The Dude was a cartoon-like depiction of a man in his early twenties, drawn by Adam Long, Jodee Rich&#x27;s brother-in-law.

==History==
One Tel began operations in May 1995. In 1999 One.Tel&#x27;s Next Generation 3GSM 1800 network was launched by joint CEOs of the mobile business, Stephen Moore and David Wright in Sydney, Australia.

The original thought process began with a simple initiative: they wanted to start a new telephone company, one that the average person would understand. The company was very people focused and focused on the residential market, as opposed to corporate business. They wanted the consumer, or everyday person in the street, to have access to the entire suite of telephony products, which is why the company was marketed with the catch phrase &quot;100% Telephone Company&quot;.

At that time, the company was firmly established in the telecommunications market, with operations in Australia, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Zürich, Frankfurt and Hong Kong.

One.Tel had three core product offerings: fixed wire long distance, Internet service provision and mobile telephony.

From 1998 through to 2000, One.Tel&#x27;s customer base more than tripled to 2.2 million and revenues doubled to $653 million. The business grew rapidly in Europe.

In December 1998 Project GSM was developed by Jodee Rich, Bradley Keeling, Kevin Beck, Stephen Moore and Alicia Crisp. This initial concept became the foundation for the One.Tel Next Gen 3GSM cellular network in Australia and spawned the international hybrid MVNO concept developed by One.Tel CTO Stephen Moore.

In February 1999, News Corporation (News) and Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) injected $709 million over three years.

In March 2000 One.Tel was successful in acquiring 15 MHz spectrum across all major capital cities. The One.Tel Next Generation Network was launched nationally six months ahead of schedule. It was the most technologically advanced network in Australia and offered differentiating features via a Smart SIM including &#x27;Voicemail with Reply Now&#x27;, &#x27;Megaphone&#x27; and location-based information-on-demand services – features that are now commonplace today.

By May 2000 One.Tel had operations in seven countries and regions (Australia, UK, HKSAR, Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Germany), over 1,900,000 active customers and was connecting over 250,000/month globally.

===The pre-IPO years: 1995 to 1997===
Jodee Rich and Brad Keeling decided to start a telephone company in August 1994. Jodee Rich developed a business plan for the company in September 1994. The ownership structure of the company in February 1995 was: Optus 28.5%; FAI 18%; James Packer 5%; Kalara Investments 50% (approximately). Kalara Investments was owned by Jodee Rich and Brad Keeling. The total initial seed capital for One.Tel was approximately $5 million. One.Tel was officially launched by Rodney Adler on 1 May 1995.

The link with Australia&#x27;s second largest telecommunications company, Optus, proved crucial to the company&#x27;s early success. One.Tel initially operated largely as a reseller of Optus services, receiving $120 for each mobile telephone customer that it attracted. The Optus contract was a wonderful deal for One.Tel and a terrible deal for Optus. One.Tel did not even need to sign up a customer to a long-term contract, it merely needed to have a customer accept a SIM card in order to receive $120 from Optus. This reportedly led to some unusual business practices, such as paying customers $10 to accept a new SIM card. Many SIM cards were never used. It also had an adverse impact on the credit-worthiness of One.Tel&#x27;s customers, as One.Tel signed up many people who would not have been accepted as customers by other telephone carriers. It has been reported that One.Tel&#x27;s customers were mainly &quot;single mothers, pensioners and teenagers&quot;. This aspect of the business has led some commentators to speculate that the business was initially conceived as a pump and dump operation - a business that had no long-term future, but was being built up for a quick sale via an initial public offering (IPO).

Between May 1995 and September 1996 One.Tel increased its customer base from zero to over 100,000. Optus decided to end its dealings with the company in September 1996, selling its shareholding back to the company for $4 million and paying compensation of $19.75 million for ending the $120 million deal early.

In its annual report for the year ended 30 June 1997, One.Tel reported revenue of $148 million and a before tax profit of $7.5 million. At that time the company had almost 300 staff.

===From IPO to the onset of problems: 1997 to 2000===
One.Tel floated on the Australian Stock Exchange at $2 per share in November 1997. Initial market capitalization was $208 million. On paper, FAI had turned a $950,000 investment into $51 million; Packer had turned $250,000 into $17 million and Rich and Keeling had a combined stake worth well over $100 million.

In addition, the company had paid out $4 million in dividends and $2.85 million in consulting fees to Rich, Keeling, FAI and Packer.

The original shareholders also received $16.9 million for the sale of two businesses, One.Net and One.Card to One.Tel in July 1998.

In the financial year ended 30 June 1998 One.Tel reported a before tax profit of $8.8 million. During the year the company had commenced a &#x27;Global Strategy&#x27;, opening offices in Los Angeles, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Amsterdam and Zürich.

In September 1998 the company purchased mobile spectrum in each of the Australian capital cities at a cost of $9.5 million with a view to establishing its own mobile network. The company was unable to secure bank finance for the deal, and James Packer and David Lowy provided $5 million each to fund the purchase.

In December 1998 the Packer-controlled Consolidated Press Holdings purchased FAI&#x27;s 16 million shares for $43 million. In February 1999 the Packer-controlled Publishing &amp; Broadcasting Limited, in conjunction with News Limited agree to provide $710 million in return for a 40% stake in the company. The One.Tel share price hits a high of $13.55 in the days leading up to the announcement of the deal, prompting an insider-trading probe by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. The News/PBL deal allowed the original shareholders to take more money from the company. Rich and Keeling received $62 million between them and James Packer received $20.5 million.

In the financial year ended 30 June 1999 One.Tel reported a before tax profit of $9.8 million.

The most remarkable day in the history of One.Tel was 23 November 1999. Lucent Technologies announced that it would build and finance a European GSM mobile network for One.Tel at a cost of up to US$10 billion. The company&#x27;s market capitalization reaches a high of A$5.3 billion on 26 November 1999, making it one of Australia&#x27;s largest 30 companies.

===The emergence of problems: the year 2000===
In March 2000 One.Tel spent $523 million on purchasing additional Australian spectrum licenses. The Packer and Murdoch families provided a further $280 million in funding. Australian investors provided $340 million in funding.

In the financial year ended 30 June 2000 One.Tel reported a loss of $291 million. The share price plummeted to below $1. The annual report included details of the remuneration of Rich and Keeling; both received a $560,000 basic salary and a $6.9 million bonus.

In a statement that would later prove ironic, James Packer told the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; in September that Rich was a visionary, that Brad and Jodee were excellent managers and that the share price would recover.

===The end: 2001===

In January 2001, Jodee met with Kerry Packer who told him, &quot;You ran out of money with Imagineering, and you&#x27;re going to do it again&quot;. A Macquarie Bank report states that the company was worth $3.5 billion, and the share price doubled within days. Merrill Lynch predicted that the company would run out of money by April.

In February, director Rodney Adler sold 5 million shares for $2.5 million.

During April and May the company&#x27;s problems became increasingly apparent. In a final attempt to give the company a chance to survive, News Limited and PBL agreed to subscribe to a rights issue at 5 cents per share to supply another $132 million in much needed cash. News Limited and PBL reneged upon the agreement later in May when further evidence of One.Tel&#x27;s financial problems emerged.

The directors appointed Ferrier Hodgson as administrator on 29 May 2001. The administrator&#x27;s report states that the company was insolvent by March 2001. The administrator began laying off the 1,400 employees of One.Tel from 8 June 2001.

===Litigation===
On 14 October 2005 the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that the personal diaries of James Packer would be made available to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to assist in its case against Jodee Rich. The Supreme Court of New South Wales ruled that the diaries should be made available to ASIC but warned that the material should not be used &quot;in a manner that simply raises prurient or titillatory interest that is not directly relevant to the case&quot;. ASIC is reportedly seeking compensation of $92 million from Jodee Rich and the former One.Tel finance director, Mark Silbermann on the basis that they did not exercise their powers with respect to the company with due care and diligence.

On 18 November 2009 Justice Austin of the New South Wales Supreme Court dismissed ASIC&#x27;s civil proceedings against One.Tel&#x27;s former joint Managing Director, Mr Jodee Rich and the company&#x27;s Finance Director, Mr Mark Silbermann.

Following a four-year trial lasting 232 hearing days Justice Austin found that ASIC had failed to prove its case against the defendant directors. The evidence presented by ASIC did not establish on the balance of probabilities that the defendants had failed to disclose or withhold financial information from One.Tel&#x27;s board regarding the company&#x27;s true financial position.

In the decision Justice Austin was critical of the way that ASIC managed the case. In particular:
*ASIC&#x27;s evidentiary case was too big. The core of ASIC&#x27;s claim required it to prove the true financial position of the large multinational One.Tel group over a period of four months in order to establish not one but many breaches of the defendant directors’ statutory duty of care and diligence. The ambitious evidentiary case in ASIC v Rich should be contrasted with ASIC&#x27;s more recent litigation against directors and officers which has aimed to target specific conduct
*ASIC made final submissions that were outside its pleaded case and the defendant directors were not given a proper opportunity to respond to them
*ASIC failed to call witnesses who would have been able to explain ambiguous documentary evidence
*ASIC used a forensic accountant as an expert witness when that person had assisted ASIC decide what course of action to take against the defendants, and
*ASIC&#x27;s argument that One.Tel&#x27;s liquidity should be assessed solely on its Australian operations was unsound because its treasury activities were conducted on a consolidated multinational basis.

These criticisms led Justice Austin to observe that &quot;there is a real question whether ASIC should ever bring civil proceedings seeking to prove so many things over such a period of time as in this case.&quot;
==One.Tel abroad==
Centrica acquired the UK business of One.Tel in 2001 and ran it successfully for some years. On 15 October 2005, Centrica stated that it wished to sell the UK One.Tel to concentrate on its oil and gas businesses. Ironically, a mooted purchaser was News Corporation. However, on 19 December 2005 The Carphone Warehouse announced it was buying the company to merge its customers with its TalkTalk telecommunications offering. The One.Tel UK business was retained as a separate operating company, and not merged into the main TalkTalk Group business. In late 2007 the One.Tel name was abolished for new customer acquisition in favour of the TalkTalk brand, though the brand existed (in 2014) for existing customers as &#x27;onetel&#x27;.

Scarlet BV acquired the Dutch business of One.Tel in 2001, eventually phasing out the name when the Scarlet brand in The Netherlands was rebranded &quot;Stipte&quot; in June 2014.

<doc id="613790" wikidata="Q7808037" url="?curid=613790" title="Tindal Street Press">
<text>Tindal Street Press was a Birmingham-based independent publisher of contemporary literary fiction, with a particular focus on writers born, or living, in Birmingham and the West Midlands. According to its website, it was &quot;a publicly funded organisation committed to providing a national and international platform for talented new writers from the English regions&quot;.

It emerged in 1998 from the Tindal Street Fiction Group, a Birmingham writers&#x27; group whose members have included Alan Mahar (its founder), Alan Beard, Jackie Gay, Joel Lane, Gul Davis, Mick Scully, Annie Murray, that was set up in 1983. Tindal Street is a no-through-street in Balsall Heath, where the group had met in the Old Moseley Arms pub.

Tindal Street Press titles have been recognised by many prizes and listings, including three Booker Prize nominations (Clare Morrall, Gaynor Arnold, Catherine O&#x27;Flynn) and two Costa First Novel of the Year awards. They have published first novels by several Midlands-based writers, including Anthony Cartwright, Paul McDonald, Clare Morrall, and Catherine O&#x27;Flynn.

Tindal Street Press was run as a not-for-profit arts organization, supported by the Arts Council England and Birmingham City Council, and based in the Custard Factory, Birmingham. In 2012 Tindal Street Press became an imprint of London-based Profile Books, who also have Serpent&#x27;s Tail as part of their portfolio.

<text>Balranald is a town within the local government area of Balranald Shire, in the Murray region of far south-western New South Wales, Australia.

The town of Balranald is located where the Sturt Highway crosses the Murrumbidgee River in a remote, semi-desert area. Although it is part of New South Wales, Balranald receives Victorian television stations, with a range of Sydney and Melbourne newspapers available.
Balranald was featured heavily in 2010–2015 Australian tourism ads, displaying the natural flora of the region with over 30 subspecies of shrubs native to Balranald and its surrounds.

==History==
Balranald is located in Mutthi Mutthi traditional country. The area has a long history before non-indigenous settlement and a strong indigenous culture continues to this day.

===Township beginnings===

In 1848 George James MacDonald, the Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Lower Darling District, arrived at the site of the present-day township with a police escort. Commissioner MacDonald had chosen the site as his base, and he and his entourage set up their camp under canvas. In 1848 Leighton Robinson and Thomas Duggan established a general store at Balranald and during the same year a public-house, the Balranald Inn, was erected by a Mr Robertson.

In 1849 the Crown Lands Commissioner MacDonald recommended to the Colonial Secretary that a township be established at the location. MacDonald was a Scotsman, born at Balranald on North Uist in the Outer Hebrides; he chose the name of his birthplace for the new settlement. He pointed out that the township&#x27;s position, on the lower reaches of the Murrumbidgee River, was expected to be of strategic importance with the impending introduction of steam navigation on the Murray.

During 1849 the surveyor Francis MacCabe laid out large reserves in the region of the Lower Murrumbidgee / Murray-Darling junction. Included in MacCabe&#x27;s surveys was a site &quot;for a Township at the North End of Caiera, otherwise Balranald Reserve&quot;. The decision to lay out Balranald township was made in November 1849. Commissioner MacDonald died in 1851 and he was succeeded by Stephen Cole. Cole used Balranald as a base until 1853, when the office of Commissioner for Crown Lands for the Lower Darling District was transferred to Euston where a new house was erected for the Commissioner.

The township of Balranald was gazetted on 4 April 1851 and the first land sale held on 14 January 1852, with thirty-five lots submitted to public auction. On 1 March 1852 an official post office opened in the township. (An earlier post office had opened in the area on 1 January 1850 but closed and was replaced by an unofficial service). From 1853 the mail contractor, John Bent, operated a service along the Murrumbidgee River between Wagga Wagga and Balranald.

A second hotel, the Carriers&#x27; Arms, was erected at Balranald in about 1852 by the German, Philipp Comitti (but records show he didn&#x27;t arrive in Australia until Mar 1854). William Graham acquired the licence of the Balranald Inn in April 1854. Graham held the licence until 1859 when he was murdered. The perpetrator was arrested and later hanged at Goulburn gaol. Denis Hanan then obtained the licence of the Balranald Inn, which he held until 1867. In 1859 Hanan purchased a punt from Captain Cadell and operated it at the southern end of Mayall Street.

The Victorian gold-rushes, which began as Balranald was being established, had a profound impact on the Riverina region by stimulating the development of the fat-stock market.  The development of the stock-route across the One-tree Plain to Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place tended to direct attention away from Balranald to the region up-river of the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan junction. By the latter half of the 1850s, when the fat-stock market was at its peak, Balranald was exhibiting signs of stagnation. A correspondent from the area made these comments about the township in August 1858: &quot;This obscure and miserable township, situated on the Lower Murrumbidgee, is here attracting a considerable share of attention, as being one of those rowdy places for which the Australian bush in the interior has become so famous&quot;.
===Burke and Wills===

The Burke and Wills expedition crossed the Murrumbidgee River at Balranald on their journey to cross Australia from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. The camels and two of the wagons crossed on the Mayall Street punt on Saturday, 15 September 1860, and the remaining waggons were brought over the next day. Camp XX was set up on the outskirts of Balranald (their twentieth camp since leaving Melbourne).

To lighten the loads on the wagons in preparation for crossing the mallee country between the Murrumbidgee and the Darling, Burke left of sugar, some rice, all eight demi-johns of lime juice, four bags of camel&#x27;s sugar, the anvil, bellows, some iron, the blacksmith&#x27;s vice, a handsaw, five axes, two rifles, several revolvers and the camel litter at Messrs Sparkes, Cramsie &amp; Co.&#x27;s store. He then took on hay and maize for the animals and flour for the men, for which he paid very high prices. Three of the men were dismissed at Balranald and returned to Melbourne, where one of the men, Charles Ferguson, successfully sued the Royal Society of Victoria for wrongful dismissal.

On Monday, 17 September 1860 the expedition departed northwards for Paika Station.
===Developments to 1900===

Balranald became a major crossing place for stock from South Australia. In 1866 Peter Young built the Royal Hotel at Balranald and began operating a second punt at the township. A toll-house was later erected on the north bank of the river near Young&#x27;s punt. William Hall purchased the Balranald Inn and the Mayall Street punt from Denis Hanan in 1867. The Commercial Hotel was erected in 1869 and the first licensee was John Russell. In 1871 a new Post &amp; Telegraph Office was erected at Balranald, the first brick building to be built in the township.

The first church to be built at Balranald was of the Church of England denomination; services began on 6 April 1873 by the incumbent minister Rev. W. H. Yarrington. Two months later the church was consecrated by the Bishop Mesac Thomas of the Diocese of Goulburn (of which Balranald was a part). A Roman Catholic church was completed in 1875. A newspaper, the &quot;Riverina Recorder&quot;, was commenced in 1877.

In 1881 the population of Balranald was about 400 and it was reported that the town supported five stores and six hotels. Balranald was proclaimed a Municipality in 1882 and Herman Levy was elected its first mayor. The first meetings of the Municipal Council were held in the old Court house at the corner of Market and River streets. A lift-span bridge was constructed over the Murrumbidgee River at Balranald, which opened in April 1883. In 1885 a new Court House was erected in the town. In 1887 Balranald was described as &quot;a squarely built little town with few prominent buildings&#x27;. By that stage it had two churches and a Gospel Hall, a hospital, a branch of the Australian Joint Stock Bank, and a Masonic Hall. By 1888 a Presbyterian church had been built there.

===1901 to the present===

The first public telephone service in Balranald was installed in 1911. The Balranald Municipal Council underwent financial difficulties, and in 1912 the NSW Government appointed a Receiver to take charge of affairs. The difficulties seem to have been overcome by the following year.

In March 1926 Balranald was connected to the Victorian Rail system via a line to Echuca. The Balranald railway line is now closed.

In 1944 Norma Male was appointed Town Clerk at the Balranald Municipal Council, the first female town clerk in New South Wales.

In 1956 the local government administrative body became the Shire of Balranald, with Shire presidents replacing Mayoral positions.

New premises for the Balranald Shire Council were opened in August 1964. They were erected at a cost of £40,000 and are located in Market Street beside the Police Station.

====Solar power====
Two large solar farms are being built south of Balranald. Both commenced construction in 2018. The Limondale Solar Farm developed by Innogy, rated at 349 Megawatts, will be Australia&#x27;s largest solar generation facility when it opens about south of the town. The Sunraysia Solar Farm, rated at 255 Megawatts (DC), is being built about south of the town by the Australian-Chinese company Maoneng Group. Both will feed into the existing power grid at the same nearby TransGrid substation.

==Climate==
Balranald has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with hot summers, cool winters and low rainfall throughout the year, typical of the far south-west. The winter has more rainy days than the rest of the year and can be rather cloudy at times. 

Rainfall records have been kept for Balranald since 1879, while those of temperature since 1907. Temperature extremes are quite marked over the full year: summers are regularly over while winters can see daytime temperatures below . The highest temperature recorded at Balranald was on 18 January 1908, while the lowest recorded was on 21 July 1982. The average annual rainfall is .

Being very far west in the state, Balranald is susceptible to cold fronts off the Great Australian Bight, even at the height of summer. On 3 February 2005 a maximum of was recorded; this is unusual given its very low elevation of and latitude of 34.6 degrees south.

==Agriculture==
Agricultural activities in the Balranald district include sheep farming, woodcutting, charcoal production and some areas of irrigated crop-growing along the rivers.

==Attractions==
Balranald Shire is the location of Yanga National Park and World Heritage listed Mungo National Park.

==Australia&#x27;s first telephone==
The first telephone to be used in Australia was installed at nearby &quot;Yanga&quot; station, to allow communications between the homestead and the shearers&#x27; quarters. The installation was carried out by James Cromyn under directions forwarded from England by his uncle Alexander Graham Bell, an early developer of the telephone.

The Balranald telephone exchange was converted from manual to automatic operation in 1988 to 1990. The manual exchange number prior to automation phone number was (050) 4841 to reach the exchange, then the numbers (050)201-000 to 201–999 were allocated for Balranald subscribers. Following the ACA renumbering in the late 1990s, the numbers are now in the (03)5020-1000 to (03)5020–1999 range.

There are two amateur radio repeaters installed near the town on the 2-metre and 70 cm. bands.

==Community==
The town has an Australian rules football team competing in the Central Murray Football League.

Golfers play at the Balranald Golf and Sporting Club on O&#x27;Connor Street.

==Population==

According to the 2021 census, there were 1,063 people in Balranald.

<text>Sturt Highway is an Australian national highway in New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. It is an important road link for the transport of passengers and freight between Sydney and Adelaide and the regions along the route.

Initially an amalgam of trunk routes, the Sturt Highway was proclaimed a state highway in NSW in 1933. In 1955, the route was allocated a National Route number (20). It was included in the National Highway system in 1992, forming the Sydney-Adelaide Link. Sturt Highway is allocated as route A20 for its entire length, the majority of which is a single carriageway, and freeway standard and 6-lane arterial road standard towards its western terminus in Gawler.

==Route==
The highway is the shortest, highest-standard route between Sydney and Adelaide. It runs generally east–west, roughly aligned to the southern bank of the Murrumbidgee River in New South Wales. Following that river&#x27;s confluence with the Murray River, it is then roughly aligned to the Murray through north-western Victoria and eastern South Australia, before it heads towards the northern outskirts of Adelaide.

The eastern terminus of Sturt Highway is at a junction with Hume Highway at Tarcutta, near Gundagai. Heading west, the highway passes through the city of Wagga Wagga and the towns of Narrandera, Darlington Point, Hay, Balranald, and Euston, leaving New South Wales by crossing the Murray River into Victoria from Buronga to Mildura. The highway continues more or less due west through the northwest of Victoria before entering South Australia. In South Australia, Sturt Highway passes Renmark, Monash, Barmera, Waikerie, Blanchetown and Nuriootpa, before reaching its western terminus at the interchange with Gawler Bypass and Northern Expressway on the outskirts of Gawler.

==History==
The route now known as Sturt Highway originated from stock routes cut across southern New South Wales through the 19th century: overlanders would travel from Sydney&#x27;s Main South Road (now Hume Highway) to Albury, and follow along the southern bank of the Murray River to Adelaide. Edward John Eyre, the English explorer, travelled from Limestone Plains (now Canberra) to Adelaide via this route in 1837, as did Charles Sturt in 1838. Eyre on his second run to South Australia headed west, following the northern bank of the Murrumbidgee River instead, crossing it at its junction with the Murray close to Boundary Bend, and travelled to Adelaide from there. The road pioneered by Eyre in 1839 left Hume Highway at Gundagai and followed the northern bank of the Murrumbidgee through the sites of Wagga Wagga, Narrandera, Hay and Balranald, and the north bank of the Murray River through the sites of Euston and Wentworth, passing north of Lake Victoria to the border with South Australia and onwards to Renmark. By 1852 a mail service by horseback operated from Wagga Wagga as far west as Balranald.

The route used by coaches between Wagga Wagga and the South Australian border as late as 1914 ran along the northern bank of the Murrumbidgee to Darlington Point – a bridge was built across the river in 1905, replacing a punt service operating from 1886 – and then continued along the river&#x27;s southern bank to Hay, crossing the river again (a bridge in Hay was opened in 1874 by Sir Henry Parkes, replacing a ferry service operating since the 1850s). The route then travelled the northern side of the Murrumbidgee through Maude and Balranald and onwards to Adelaide. By 1919 the route from Hay had been altered to travel the river&#x27;s southern bank to Maude, before departing the water course for a more-direct route to Balranald, crossing the river there by a bridge opened in 1876. By 1928, the route had shifted south of the Murrumbidgee River between Tarcutta and Narrandera.

The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 4 was declared along this road from the intersection with Hume Highway from Lower Tarcutta to Wagga Wagga (and continuing eastwards via Tumut, Adaminaby, Cooma, and Bega to Tathra) as part of Monaro Highway, Main Road No. 6 was declared from Balranald via Euston and Wentworth to the state border with South Australia (and continuing eastwards via Oxley, Booligal, Gunbar, Rankins Springs, Wyalong and Cowra to Bathurst) as part of Mid-Western Highway, and Main Road No. 58 was declared from Hay via Narranderra to Wagga Wagga (and continuing westwards via Maude to Oxley), on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, these were amended to State Highways 4 and 6 and Trunk Road 58 on 8 April 1929.

Mid-Western Highway was rerouted between Gunbar and Balranald to pass through Hay, and the western end of Trunk Road 58 was truncated to meet it at Hay, on 24 September 1929. The route of the main road from Narrandera to Darlington Point had shifted to the southern side of the river at this stage, thus following the present route east from Balranald. On 16 September 1930, the road between Wagga Wagga and Hay (Trunk Road 58) was named Sturt Trunk Road, in honour of Captain Charles Sturt who explored the area a century earlier and opened it up for agriculture.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in the previous year, declared Sturt Highway as State Highway 14 on 8 August 1933, from the intersection with Hume Highway at Lower Tarcutta via Wagga Wagga, Hay, Balranald, Euston and Wentworth to the state border with South Australia, subsuming the existing portions of Monaro Highway (State Highway 4) between Wagga Wagga and Lower Tarcutta, Sturt Trunk Road (Trunk Road 58) from Wagga Wagga to Hay, and Mid-Western Highway (State Highway 6) from Hay to the state border with South Australia. eventually to Adelaide via Renmark; the western end of Monaro Highway (today Snowy Mountains Highway) was truncated to meet Hume Highway in Tarcutta, and the western end of Mid-Western Highway was truncated to meet Sturt Highway in Hay, as a result. On 1 July 1938, the South Australian government decreed &quot;the road from Gawler through Blanchetown to the border beyond Renmark will be known as the Sturt Highway&quot;, to join with the same road in New South Wales.

In 1939, Sturt Highway was rerouted to run via Mildura, using the former alignment of Murray Valley Highway, to make it the most direct route to Adelaide. Murray Valley Highway had been constructed in 1927 to provide a shorter, all-weather road connection between Mildura and Renmark, and was declared a State Highway by the Country Roads Board of Victoria in September 1932.

Sturt Highway was signed National Route 20 across its entire length in 1955. The Whitlam government introduced the federal &quot;National Roads Act 1974&quot;, where roads declared as a National Highway were still the responsibility of the states for road construction and maintenance, but were fully compensated by the Federal government for money spent on approved projects. As an important interstate link between the capitals of New South Wales and South Australia, Sturt Highway was declared a National Highway in 1992. With all three states&#x27; conversion to their newer alphanumeric systems between the late 1990s to the early 2010s, its former route number was updated to A20 for the highway within Victoria (in 1997), South Australia (in 1998), and eventually the New South Wales section (in 2013).

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Sturt Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 14, from the intersection with Hume Highway north of Tarcutta to the bridge over the Murray River at Mildura.

The passing of the &quot;Road Management Act 2004&quot; through the Parliament of Victoria granted the responsibility of overall management and development of Victoria&#x27;s major arterial roads to VicRoads: in 2004, VicRoads re-declared Sturt Highway (Arterial #6610) from the border with South Australia at Murray-Sunset to the border with New South Wales in Mildura.

==Upgrades==
===South Australia===
None of the Sturt Highway was originally constructed as dual-carriageway. Work began in January 2007 to upgrade the highway to a four-lane, dual-carriageway road between Gawler Bypass and Greenock in the Barossa Valley. The project was completed in 2010 with budget savings directed towards further Sturt Highway improvements.

Northern Expressway was built at the south-western end of Sturt Highway, as part of an AusLink/Government of South Australia project to build a new freeway-standard road, as part of the North–South Corridor project, providing better access for road transport to Port Adelaide and the industrial areas west and northwest of Adelaide.

Other projects in South Australia include a number of overtaking lanes added in the 2000s and 2010s to help make it safer with the high volume of traffic. Major &#x27;S&#x27;-bend curves near Waikerie were realigned, and further upgrades to the road were performed up to 2012.

====Significant route changes====
The original route of Sturt Highway in the Riverland passing through Berri and Glossop was bypassed to pass through Monash in 1995. The former alignment is now known as the &quot;Old Sturt Highway&quot;, route B201. The original route passed through the middle of the Barossa Valley, along what is now the Barossa Valley Way. This first changed to a route passing to the north of Nuriootpa, around to the north and west of Gawler on the Gawler Bypass and Main North Road to Gepps Cross. It later changed to use the Northern Expressway instead. The more recent road duplication led to it bypassing Daveyston and Shea-Oak Log instead of passing through these small towns.

When the Northern Expressway and Northern Connector were assigned as route M2, route A20 reverted to following Main North Road south to Gepps Cross.

====Truro bypass====
A new alignment is proposed to be built to the north of the town of Truro, to remove the highway traffic from the main street of the town. The bypass is proposed to be funded by the Australian government for $161.6 million and state government $40.4 million. Construction is expected to start late in 2022 and be completed by the end of 2026. The project will adjust the alignment to reduce the steep hill between the Murray Flats and Truro. It will be built to a standard suitable for triple road trains.

===Victoria===
There is a proposed Mildura Truck Bypass, to be funded by Auslink 2.

==Major river crossings==
From east to west, the Sturt Highway follows much of the course of the Murrumbidgee River, on its southern banks, from the Sturt&#x27;s eastern terminus with the Hume Motorway. At , the Sturt Highway crosses the Murrumbidgee, carrying the highway to the north of the river via the Balranald Bridge.

To the west and south-west, Sturt Highway crosses the Murray four times:

*Between Buronga and Mildura, carrying the highway to the south of the Murray over the George Chaffey Bridge, a high concrete-girder bridge that was opened in 1985. 
* Between and Renmark, carrying the highway to the north of the Murray over the Paringa Bridge, a lift-span bridge which used to have a railway through the middle as well as vehicle carriageways on each side. 
*Between and Kingston On Murray, carrying the highway to the south of the Murray over the Kingston Bridge, a high bridge from an embankment on the right bank to the cliffs on the left bank. 
*At Blanchetown, carrying the highway from east to west over the Murray, as the river flows south, over the Blanchetown Bridge, another high bridge to cliffs on the river&#x27;s western bank.

The bridge at Blanchetown was originally opened in 1964. It replaced cable ferries, and was itself replaced in 1998 in response to concern about its ability to continue to carry B-double trucks. The bridge at Kingston On Murray was opened in 1973, also replacing a very busy ferry crossing.
