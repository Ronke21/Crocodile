<text>, commonly referred to simply as Bee Train, is a Japanese animation studio founded by Kōichi Mashimo in 1997. Since their involvement with &quot;Noir&quot;, &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, and &quot;Madlax&quot; (among other series) they have a strong following in the yuri fandom for being involved in series portraying strong female leads with speculatively ambiguous relationships.

==History==
The studio Bee Train was founded on June 5, 1997, by Kōichi Mashimo, who was previously a director at Tatsunoko Productions and the founder of Mashimo Jimusho, a small freelance staff working for other studios. Originally, Bee Train was a subsidiary of Production I.G along with Xebec but in February 2006, it ended its relationship and became independent.

Koichi Mashimo&#x27;s goal when he founded Bee Train was to create a &quot;hospital for animators&quot;, an animation studio interested in nurturing young talents and artistic quality of production rather than in corporate strategies and profit. This studio-as-hospital approach was allegedly invented by Mashimo during his prolonged stay in an intensive care unit (after a severe skiing accident) and has been Bee Train&#x27;s official strategy ever since.

The first projects published by the studio in 1999 were anime adaptations of video game franchises popular in Japan: &quot;PoPoLoCrois&quot;, &quot;Arc the Lad&quot;, &quot;Wild Arms: Twilight Venom&quot;, and &quot;Medabots&quot;. Later, Bandai Visual joined forces with Bee Train to produce an anime OVA based on the famous .hack video game series. Simultaneously, they decided to promote the games with an anime television series, that aired in 2002 as &quot;.hack//Sign&quot; and is among Bee Train&#x27;s most famous works. The OVA became known as &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot; and its four episodes were added as bonus material to each of the original four games of the franchise. In 2006, Bee Train produced &quot;.hack//Roots&quot;, a prequel anime to the &quot;.hack//G.U.&quot; games and a spiritual successor to &quot;Sign&quot;.

Bee Train&#x27;s first independent project was &quot;Noir&quot;. Aired in 2001, the series was produced at the same time as &quot;Sign&quot; and became the first installment of Bee Train&#x27;s &quot;girls-with-guns&quot; trilogy. After &quot;Noir&quot; had become widely successful in Japan, France, the United States, Germany, and other Western countries, the second series, &quot;Madlax&quot;, was produced in 2004 and the third, &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;, went on air in April 2007. Although the &quot;girls-with-guns&quot; series are considered Bee Train&#x27;s and, particularly, Mashimo&#x27;s signature works, the original idea belonged to their common executive producer Shigeru Kitayama.

From 1997 on, the studio&#x27;s headquarters were located in Kokubunji, Tokyo, although in 2001, it moved to another part of the city. Two more studio locations were acquired in 2004 (in Karuizawa, Nagano) and 2006 (Kichijōji, Musashino, Tokyo).

The company has been dormant since 2012 due to Kōichi Mashimo&#x27;s retirement from the anime industry. The official website was removed in 2024.

==Style==
One frequent technique that Mashimo uses as part of his studio-as-hospital strategy is brainstorming new anime concepts with his colleagues in the state of alcohol intoxication. For example, according to him, that is how the idea of the supernatural connection between the two female leads of &quot;Madlax&quot; was born.

Another typical Bee Train gesture is to invite Japanese voice actors who have already worked on some of their projects to voice the characters similar to the ones they voiced before. For example, this list includes Hōko Kuwashima (Kirika Yuumura in &quot;Noir&quot;, Margaret Burton in &quot;Madlax&quot;), Aya Hisakawa (Chloe, Limelda Jorg, Jodie Hayward in &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;), and Kaori Nazuka (Subaru in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, Shino in &quot;.hack//Roots&quot;).

The famous Japanese composer and music producer Yuki Kajiura has created musical scores for multiple projects by Bee Train since &quot;Noir&quot; (whose appeal lay to a large degree in its soundtrack). Kajiura has provided music for &quot;Sign&quot;, &quot;Liminality&quot;, &quot;Madlax&quot; (as part of FictionJunction Yuuka), &quot;Tsubasa Chronicle&quot;, and recently &quot;El Cazador de la Bruja&quot;. When explaining his preference for Kajiura&#x27;s work, Mashimo once commented that &quot;she&#x27;s a storyteller who just happens to know how to write music&quot;. Another frequent collaboration is that between Bee Train and the musical duo Ali Project (&quot;Noir&quot;, &quot;Avenger&quot;, &quot;.hack//Roots&quot;). Generally, the music plays a just as important role in Bee Train&#x27;s works as visuals and dialogue do, sometimes even drowning the latter (heard, for example, in &quot;.hack//Sign&quot;, &quot;Avenger&quot;, and &quot;Madlax&quot;).

==Works==

===In the works===
==Other divisions==

Bee Train Digital was Bee Train&#x27;s small special effects and other works area that has mostly provided additional production support to projects such as effects, finishing and photography work for &quot;.hack//SIGN&quot;, &quot;.hack//Liminality&quot;, &quot;Avenger&quot;, and &quot;Murder Princess&quot;. It also created the special effects for &quot;Toaru Majutsu no Index&quot; and 2D works in ending theme of &quot;Canaan&quot;. Studio Road, which resides within the studio&#x27;s offices, provides animation finishing services for Bee Train and several other studios. Through the 2009-2010 year, two new divisions were added. C-Station Department, which served as its animation design department and D-Station Department, which was reorganized from Bee Train Digital, is the digital production and digital photography works. In 2012, C-Station broke away from Bee Train becoming independent and D-Station has since been delisted by the company.

<text>William Doyle Ruckelshaus (July 24, 1932 – November 27, 2019) was an American attorney and government official.

Ruckelshaus served in the Indiana House of Representatives from 1966 to 1968, and was the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division from 1969 to 1970. He was also the first Administrator of the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) from 1970 to 1973, after being nominated by Richard Nixon. He returned to the position from 1983 to 1985, as the fifth Administrator of the EPA, during the Reagan administration. In 1973, he was also the acting FBI Director.

While serving as US Deputy Attorney General in October 1973, in what became known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre,&quot; Ruckelshaus and US Attorney General Elliot Richardson resigned from their positions rather than obey the order of US President Richard Nixon to fire the independent special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, who was tasked with investigating Nixon&#x27;s role in the Watergate scandal.

== Early life, military service, and education ==
Ruckelshaus was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on July 24, 1932, the son of Marion Doyle (&quot;née&quot; Covington) and John K. Ruckelshaus. He was from a distinguished family with a long history of practicing law in Indianapolis and serving in Republican Party politics.

He attended parochial schools until the age of 16, then finished high school in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, at the Portsmouth Abbey School.

He began college at Princeton University before being drafted and serving for two years in the United States Army, becoming a drill sergeant at Fort Lewis in Tacoma, Washington. He left the Army in 1955, returning to and graduating from Princeton with an A.B. (cum laude) in history in 1957 after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;American Attitudes toward the Spanish Civil War.&quot; In 1960 he earned an LL.B. from Harvard Law School and joined the family law firm in Indianapolis.

In 1960, Ruckelshaus married Ellen Urban, who died the following year from complications incurred after giving birth to their twin daughters. In 1962 he remarried, to Jill Strickland, with whom he had three children.

His brother was John C. Ruckelshaus and his nephew was John Ruckelshaus; they also served in the Indiana General Assembly.

== Early legal and political career (1960–1970) ==
After passing the Indiana bar exam, Ruckelshaus joined the family law firm of Ruckelshaus, Bobbitt, and O&#x27;Connor.

In 1960, at age 28, he was appointed as Deputy Attorney General of Indiana, and served through 1965. For two years he was assigned to the Indiana Board of Health. As counsel to the Indiana Stream Pollution Control Board, Ruckelshaus obtained court orders prohibiting industries and municipalities from heavily polluting the state&#x27;s water supply; he also helped draft the Indiana Air Pollution Control Act of 1961, the state&#x27;s first attempt to reduce that problem. After that assignment, he spent two years as Chief Counsel for the Attorney General&#x27;s Office.

In 1964, Ruckelshaus ran as a moderate Republican in the U.S. House election in Indiana&#x27;s 11th district, losing in the primary to Don Tabbert, a candidate from the conservative wing of the party. He subsequently spent a year as minority attorney for the Indiana Senate.

He won a seat in the Indiana House of Representatives in 1966, benefiting from an up year for Republicans overall. He served in the House for one term, until 1968. He became the first first-term legislator to serve as majority leader of the House.

Ruckelshaus ran in the 1968 United States Senate election in Indiana, winning the Republican nomination, but losing the general election, 51%–48%, to incumbent Birch Bayh.

In 1969, President Richard Nixon appointed him as U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division of the U.S. Department of Justice in Nixon&#x27;s new administration. Ruckelshaus held the post until his appointment as the first administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970.

== EPA Administrator (1970–1973) ==
Ruckelshaus became the US Environmental Protection Agency&#x27;s first administrator when the agency was formed on December 2, 1970 by Nixon. Although many people were mentioned as possibilities for the new position, the choice of Ruckelshaus had been based upon the strong recommendation of US Attorney General John N. Mitchell. Ruckelhaus had been suggested in a &quot;Newsweek&quot; opinion column by a friend without his knowledge and was later approached Mitchell about the position.

The burning of the Cuyahoga River had created a national outcry. The Justice Department under Mitchell filed a civil lawsuit against the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company &quot;for discharging substantial quantities of cyanide into the Cuyahoga&quot; at Ruckelshaus&#x27;s request and sought an injunction &quot;to halt the discharge of these deleterious materials into the river...&quot;

Also during his first tenure at the EPA, Ruckelshaus advocated for and enacted a ban on the insecticide DDT.

Ruckelshaus laid the foundation for the EPA by hiring its leaders by defining its mission, deciding on priorities, and selecting an organizational structure. He also oversaw the implementation of the Clean Air Act of 1970.

== Saturday Night Massacre (1973) ==
In April 1973, during the growing Watergate scandal, there was a major reshuffling of Nixon administration posts because of the resignations of White House Chief of Staff H. R. Haldeman and Domestic Affairs Advisor John Ehrlichman. Ruckelshaus&#x27;s record of success at EPA and Justice and his reputation for integrity led to his being appointed acting Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to replace L. Patrick Gray III, &quot;who had allowed Nixon aides to examine Watergate files and had even destroyed evidence in the case.&quot; Later that year, Ruckelshaus was promoted to Deputy Attorney General.

On October 20, 1973, in the event known as the &quot;Saturday Night Massacre,&quot; Attorney General Elliot Richardson and then Ruckelshaus resigned their positions, rather than obey orders from Nixon to fire the Watergate special prosecutor, Archibald Cox, who was investigating official misconduct by Nixon and his aides and sought &quot;tape recordings that... would incriminate&quot; Nixon. After the resignations, the third in command at the Justice Department, US Solicitor General Robert Bork immediately effected the firing and the abolition of the special prosecutor&#x27;s office, completing the &quot;Massacre.&quot; However, 300,000 telegrams, release of the tapes, the reinstatement of a special prosecutor, and (ultimately) Nixon&#x27;s resignation in August 1974 would occur over the next 10 months.

== Private law (1973–1983) ==
After leaving the Justice Department, Ruckelshaus returned to the private sector as an attorney at the Washington law firm of Ruckelshaus, Beveridge, Fairbanks, and Diamond from 1973 to 1975.

In 1975, Ruckelshaus moved to Seattle, Washington, where he accepted a position as senior vice-president for law and corporate affairs of the Tacoma-based Weyerhaeuser timber company. Ruckelshaus remained in that position until 1983.

Ruckelshaus was one of Gerald Ford&#x27;s preferred candidates to be his vice presidential running mate in the 1976 election. Ford selected Bob Dole; the two lost the election to Democrat Jimmy Carter and his running mate, Walter Mondale.

== Return to the EPA (1983–1985) ==
In 1983, with the EPA in crisis due to mass resignations over the mishandling of the Superfund program, President Ronald Reagan appointed Ruckelshaus to serve as EPA Administrator again. This time it was White House Chief of Staff James Baker who was Ruckelshaus&#x27;s champion in asking him to return to the agency. The White House acceded to Ruckhelshaus&#x27;s request to allow him maximum autonomy in the choice of new appointees.

Ruckelshaus&#x27;s predecessor, Anne Gorsuch Burford (mother of future U.S. Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch), had depleted the EPA by asking Congress to cut the agency&#x27;s budget, eliminating jobs and halting enforcement activities. On his second day after taking over for Burford, Ruckelsaus fired four people on the agency&#x27;s management team.

Under Ruckelshaus&#x27; tenure, the issue of asbestos in schools was directed against the EPA.

Ruckelshaus attempted to win back public confidence in the EPA, a challenging task in the face of a skeptical press and a wary Congress, both of whom scrutinized all aspects of the agency&#x27;s activities and some of whom interpreted a number of its actions in the worst possible light. Nonetheless, Ruckelshaus filled the top-level staffing slots with persons of competence, turned the attention of the staff back to the agency&#x27;s fundamental mission, and raised the esteem of the agency in the public mind.

On November 28, 1984, Ruckelshaus announced that he would be retiring as EPA head, effective January 5, 1985, around the start of President Reagan&#x27;s second term. He remained Administrator until February 7, 1985, when his successor, Lee M. Thomas, was confirmed.

Of his two tenures at EPA, Ruckelshaus later reflected:

== Subsequent career ==
=== 1980s and 1990s ===
Ruckelshaus was at Perkins Coie, a Seattle-based law firm, from 1985 to 1988. From 1983 to 1986, he served on the World Commission on Environment and Development set up by the United Nations.

From 1988 to 1999, he served as chief executive officer of Browning-Ferris Industries of Houston, Texas, a major and expanding waste-removal firm. During his tenure, Browning Ferris shifted from a focus on hazardous wastes to recycling. As the company expanded its operations into New York City, Ruckelshaus &quot;helped investigators infiltrate a Mafia-dominated carting conspiracy, leading prosecutors to obtain indictments.&quot;

After leaving Browning-Ferris, Ruckelshaus became a partner in the private investment firm, Madrona Venture Group.

President Bill Clinton appointed Ruckelshaus as a member of the President&#x27;s Council for Sustainable Development from 1993 to 1997, and as U.S. special envoy in the implementation of the Pacific Salmon Treaty from 1997 to 1998. He was also appointed Chairman of the Salmon Recovery Funding Board for the state of Washington.

=== 2000s and 2010s ===

Ruckelshaus was appointed by President George W. Bush to serve on the United States Commission on Ocean Policy, which submitted its Final Report to the President and Congress, &quot;An Ocean Blueprint for the 21st Century&quot;, in 2004.

In June 2010, Ruckelshaus became co-chair of the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative.

Ruckelshaus served as a director on boards of several corporations, including Isilon Systems, Monsanto, Cummins, Pharmacia, Solutia, Coinstar, Nordstrom, Pfizer, and Weyerhaeuser.

He was Chair of the Advisory Board of The William D. Ruckelshaus Center at the University of Washington and Washington State University, Chair Emeritus of the University of Wyoming&#x27;s Ruckelshaus Institute for Environment and Natural Resources, Chairman Emeritus of the World Resources Institute, and Chair of the Meridian Institute. He was a director of the Initiative for Global Development.

In 2008, Ruckelshaus endorsed Barack Obama in the 2008 election for President of the United States. In August 2016, Ruckelshaus and another former Republican-appointed EPA administrator, William K. Reilly, jointly endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in the 2016 election.

In 2008, Ruckelshaus was appointed to the Washington State Puget Sound Partnership, an agency devoted to cleaning up Puget Sound. In early 2012, Ruckelshaus was appointed co-chair of the Washington Blue Ribbon Panel on ocean acidification.

In August 2018, Ruckelshaus drew parallels to the actions of President Donald Trump&#x27;s administration relating to special prosecutor Robert Mueller and Ruckelshaus&#x27;s own experiences during the Massacre and with President Nixon&#x27;s &quot;disrespect for the rule of law&quot; in an opinion-editorial in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

=== Presidential Medal of Freedom ===
In November 2015, Ruckelshaus was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama during a ceremony at the White House.

== Death ==
Ruckelshaus died at his home in Medina, Washington, on November 27, 2019, at age 87.

<text>aMule is a free peer-to-peer file sharing utility that works with the eDonkey network and the Kad network, offering similar features to eMule and adding others such as GeoIP (country flags). On August 18, 2003 it was forked from the xMule source code, which itself is a fork of the lMule project, which was the first attempt to bring the eMule client to Linux. These projects were discontinued and aMule is the resulting project, though aMule has less and less resemblance to the client that sired it.

aMule shares code with the eMule project. The credit and partials downloads of eMule can be used by aMule and vice versa, making program substitution simple.

aMule aims to be portable over multiple platforms and is doing this with the help of the wxWidgets library. Currently supported systems include Linux, macOS, various BSD-derived systems, Windows, Irix and Solaris. Beside the stable releases the project also offers SVN versions as an unstable release.

== TCP and UDP ports ==
According to the aMule official FAQ, these are the default ports. Server ports 4661 TCP and 4665 UDP are only used by the EDonkey network. Therefore, the Kad Network will only use 4662 TCP and 4672 UDP. The traffic direction is from client perspective:
* 4661 TCP (outgoing): Port on which an eDonkey server listens for connection (port number may vary depending on eDonkey server used).
* 4662 TCP (outgoing and incoming): Client to client transfers.
* 4665 UDP (outgoing and incoming): Used for global eDonkey server searches and global source queries. This is always Client TCP port + 3.
* 4672 UDP (outgoing and incoming): Extended aMule protocol, Queue Rating, File Reask Ping
* 4711 TCP: WebServer listening port. Used if aMule is accessed through the web.
* 4712 TCP: internal Connection port. Used to communicate aMule with other applications such as aMule WebServer or aMuleCMD.

Most of these ports are customizable.

== Monolithic and modular build ==
aMule can be compiled using &quot;-disable-monolithic&quot; parameter: this allows aMule to be run in a modular way. This means that the core functionalities of the program can be started using codice_1, the aMule daemon while the software behavior can be controlled through three different interfaces:
;aMuleCMD: The command-line aMule client.
;aMuleGUI: The &quot;regular&quot; GUI of the software. Experimental, a lot of features missing in comparison with the monolithic version and is unstable. There are Linux and Windows version for this tool: users can connect an aMule instance running on Linux from a workstation running Windows and the Win32 version of aMuleGUI.
;aMuleWEB: The web interface provided by the aMule core built-in Webserver. It can be retrieved via the LAN or from the Internet, provided any Internet router is properly configured using port forwarding.

The company is headquartered in the Ohizumi Studio in Nerima, Tokyo.

Their mascot is the cat Pero, from the company&#x27;s 1969 film adaptation of &quot;Puss in Boots&quot;.

Toei Animation produced anime versions of works from manga series by manga artists, including Go Nagai (&quot;Mazinger Z&quot;), Eiichiro Oda (&quot;One Piece&quot;), Shotaro Ishinomori (&quot;Cyborg 009&quot;), Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro (&quot;Toriko&quot;), Takehiko Inoue (&quot;Slam Dunk&quot;), Mitsuteru Yokoyama (&quot;Sally the Witch&quot;), Masami Kurumada (&quot;Saint Seiya&quot;), Akira Toriyama (&quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;), Leiji Matsumoto (&quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot;), and Naoko Takeuchi (&quot;Sailor Moon&quot;). The studio helped propel the popularity of the Magical Girl and &quot;Super Robot&quot; genres of anime; Toei&#x27;s TV series include the first magical-girl anime series, &quot;Mahoutsukai Sally&quot; (an adaptation of Mitsuteru Yokoyama&#x27;s manga of the same name), and Go Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Mazinger Z&quot;, an adaptation of his manga which set the standard for Super Robot anime. Although the Toei Company usually contracts Toei Animation to handle its animation internally, they occasionally hire other companies to provide animation; although the Toei Company produced the &quot;Robot Romance Trilogy&quot;, Sunrise (then known as Nippon Sunrise) provided the animation. Toei Company would also enlist the help of other studios such as hiring Academy Productions to produce the animation for &quot;Space Emperor God Sigma&quot;, rather than use their own studio.

Toei Animation&#x27;s anime which have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award are &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; in 1981, &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; in 1987 and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; in 1992. In addition to producing anime for release in Japan, Toei Animation began providing animation for American films and television series during the 1960s and particularly during the 1980s.

In October 2021, Toei Animation announced that they had signed a strategic partnership with the South Korean entertainment conglomerate CJ ENM.

=== 2022 ransomware attack ===
On March 6, 2022, an incident occurred in which an unauthorized third party attempted to hack Toei Animation&#x27;s network, which resulted in the company&#x27;s online store and internal systems becoming temporarily suspended. The company investigated the incident and stated that the hack would affect the broadcast schedules of several anime series, including &quot;One Piece&quot;. In addition, &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot; was also rescheduled to June 11, 2022, due to the hack. On April 6, 2022, Toei Animation announced that it would resume broadcasting the anime series, including &quot;One Piece&quot;. The following day, the Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported that the hack was caused by a targeted ransomware attack.

== Foreign production history ==

Toei has been commissioned to provide animation by Japanese and American studios such as Sunbow Entertainment, Marvel Productions, Hanna-Barbera, DIC Entertainment, Rankin/Bass Productions and World Events Productions (DreamWorks Animation). In the 60&#x27;s, they primarily worked with Rankin/Bass, but beginning in the 80&#x27;s, they worked with Marvel Productions and their list of clients grew, until the end of the decade. Toei didn&#x27;t provide much outsourced animation work in the 90&#x27;s and since the 2000s has only rarely worked with other companies outside Japan.
== Controversies ==
=== Fair use disputes ===
Between 2008 and 2018, Toei Animation had copyright claimed TeamFourStar&#x27;s parody series, &quot;DragonBall Z Abridged&quot;. TFS stated that the parody series is protected under fair use.

On December 7, 2021, Toei Animation copyright claimed over 150 videos by YouTuber Totally Not Mark, real name Mark Fitzpatrick. He uploaded a video addressing the issue, claiming that they were protected under fair use, and that nine of the videos do not include any Toei footage. He also outlined the appeal process on YouTube, and estimated having the videos reinstated could take over 37 years. He then goes on to announce that he would not be supporting new Toei releases until the issue had been resolved, and also called for a boycott on the upcoming &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero&quot; film. The dispute sparked discussion on YouTube on the vulnerability of creators against the copyright system and lack of fair use laws in Japan, with YouTubers such as PewDiePie and The Anime Man speaking out on the issue.

On January 26, 2022, Fitzpatrick had his videos reinstated after negotiations with YouTube.

=== Treatment of employees ===
On January 20, 2021, two employees have accused Toei Animation of overworking their employees and discrimination towards sexual minorities. The company had inappropriately referred to employees who identifies as X-gender (a non-binary identity in Japan).

<doc id="612748" wikidata="Q5214091" url="?curid=612748" title="Dan Neil (journalist)">
<text>Dan Neil is an American journalist, widely known an automotive columnist for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and a former staff writer at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;AutoWeek&quot; and &quot;Car and Driver.&quot; He was a panelist on 2011&#x27;s &quot;The Car Show&quot; with Adam Carolla on Speed Channel.

In 1999, Neil received the International Motor Press Association&#x27;s &quot;Ken Purdy Award&quot; for automotive journalism, and in 2004 Neil won the Pulitzer Prize for Criticism, presented annually to a newspaper writer who has demonstrated &#x27;distinguished criticism.&#x27; Awarded for his &quot;LA Times&quot; column &quot;Rumble Seat,&quot; the Pulitzer board noted Neil&#x27;s &quot;one-of-a-kind reviews of automobiles, blending technical expertise with offbeat humor and astute cultural criticism.&quot;

Journalist Brooke Gladstone called Neil &quot;the Oscar Wilde of auto reviewers.&quot; Freelance automotive journalist Thomas Bey called Neil &quot;the thinking man&#x27;s smart ass.&quot;

==Background==
Neil was born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on January 12, 1960, and moved to New Bern, North Carolina, at age 4. His father was an engineer with Stanley Powertools and his mother was a private investigator. He received a B.A. degree in Creative Writing from East Carolina University and an M.A. degree in English Literature from North Carolina State University.

Neil is married to Tina Larsen Neil and has twin daughters, Rosalind and Vivienne — as well as a son, Henry (Hank) Neil, from his first marriage. After four years of trying to get pregnant and several in-vitro fertilization procedures, Neil&#x27;s wife conceived four embryos in a high risk, &quot;white knuckle pregnancy.&quot; Facing further complications, he and his wife chose to abort two of the fetuses. Neil wrote about the experience for the LA Times. 

Neil lived in Los Angeles before moving again to North Carolina, when he left the L.A. Times and began writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==Early career==
Neil began his professional writing career with the &quot;Spectator&quot;, a local free weekly, and began working for &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; of Raleigh, North Carolina as an obituary writer in 1985. 

In interviews he has said his goals at the time were to &quot;learn to write and see the world.&quot; Neil was recruited by &quot;AutoWeek&quot; magazine in 1994 as a senior contributing editor. In 1995, he began contributing reviews to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; which he continued until 2003.

Beginning with his work at &quot;The News &amp; Observer,&quot; Neil developed his writing style, combining humor with pragmatic insight, literary analogies and personal experience. Neil worked with the Raleigh paper until 1996, when he was fired. He subsequently worked as a free-lance journalist, including five years as contributing editor to &quot;Car and Driver&quot;. In 1999 Neil was named senior contributing editor for travel magazine &quot;Expedia Travels,&quot; a post he held through 2001.

In 1999, Neil won the Ken Purdy Award for Excellence in Automotive Journalism, from the International Motor Press Association. In 2002, his work was selected for Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s Best American Sports Writing.

===Firing from the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot;===
In 1991, Dan Neil had been moved from the newsroom of the &quot;News &amp; Observer&quot; to the classified advertising department with the expectation &quot;that he would write dealer-friendly pieces to attract readers to the newspaper&#x27;s automobile classified section.&quot; In contrast to the newsroom, where Neil had worked with editors, he noticed his copy was no longer edited. &quot;For seven years, I had unfettered access to 200,000 readers.&quot; Neil&#x27;s writing eventually reflected the lack of constraint.

Neil&#x27;s January 1996 review of the Ford Expedition described a back-seat encounter with his girlfriend, writing &quot;this was loving, consensual and — given the Expedition&#x27;s dual airbags, side impact beams and standard four-wheel anti-lock brakes — safe sex.&quot; The News and Observer reported Neil&#x27;s recollection of the column in an interview years later:&quot;I wrote at some point about the kids getting into the Ford Expedition and commenting on the &#x27;footprints&#x27; on the windshield. Well, that was just it! People went crazy! It was kind of like Janet Jackson&#x27;s costume malfunction -- a none too daring transgression, overall, but the thing that finally sent people over the edge.&quot; 

Put on probation for the article, Neil was instructed to have his articles reviewed by an editor as well as the director of classified auto advertising. Refusing, he was subsequently fired, and wrote in a later &quot;Independent Weekly&quot; article that he was fired &quot;for refusing to have my column vetted by the classified advertising department.&quot;

Editors from &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; contended that it was disingenuous to suggest that advertisers pressured the paper into firing Neil, since Neil worked for an advertorial section of the advertising department at the time.

The incident highlighted the growing issue that newspapers, under economic pressure, have in maintaining the virtual wall between the &quot;church&quot; of news gathering and the &quot;state&quot; of advertising sales, sometimes known as a Chinese wall. Notably, Keith Bradsher — author of a book about SUV&#x27;s called &quot;High and Mighty&quot; — indicated that among critics, &quot;auto reviewers are the most likely to be compromised by the industry they cover.&quot; Speaking in a 2005 radio interview with Brooke Gladstone, after receiving the Pulitzer Prize, Neil described the symbiotic relationship between the automobile industry and its critics:
::&quot;&quot;The entire environment is incestuous. They introduce new cars. They fly journalists in and put them up at really nice hotels and, you know, treat them to experiences that they would never possibly in a million years — they wouldn&#x27;t even be allowed in these hotels ordinarily. You know, and that&#x27;s not supposed to affect their judgment. But it is a compromised business, and it is also true that newspapers are under a great deal of revenue pressure on this score, and so yeah, a favorable editorial/advertorial content is often created to satisfy that need.&quot;

==LA Times==
In September 2003, Neil became a full-time columnist for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and gained a following for his approach to automotive writing, which routinely included industry criticism — including criticism of automakers themselves and government emissions and safety policies.

In February 2005, he began writing &quot;800 Words&quot;, a column about pop culture, for the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;. The column was syndicated by Tribune Media in 2006. Neil won the American Association of Sunday and Feature Editors award for best general commentary column in 2007.

&quot;800 Words&quot; was discontinued in 2008 after the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; was transferred from the editorial department to the paper&#x27;s business division — and advertiser control.

In February 2010, Neil left the L.A. Times and accepted a position at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

=== 2008 Zell lawsuit ===

In 2008, Neil participated in a federal class action suit against Sam Zell, who in 2007 purchased the Tribune Company, owner of the Los Angeles Times.

After the takeover, Zell rated reporters by how many column inches they produced, relinquished the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot; and other editorial publications to advertiser control — and laid off at least 1,000 employees.

Neil called Zell &quot;a corporate raider,&quot; adding &quot;he&#x27;s not a publisher. Newspapers are too important to the public to be treated as just pieces on a financial chessboard.&quot; Neil and a group of Times employees claimed violations of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) and alleged that Zell breached his duty of loyalty to Tribune&#x27;s employees.

Forbes described the suit as putting &quot;the fast-changing newspaper business on trial,&quot; noting &quot;newspapers have been under siege since the technology bubble popped in the late 1990s, with problems ranging from declining circulation, advertiser consolidation, classified ads migrating online, rising newsprint costs, bloated debt structures and, yes, over-staffing. Not to mention the rise of Internet news.&quot;

<text>Wizards is a 1977 American animated post-apocalyptic science fantasy film written, directed and produced by Ralph Bakshi and distributed by 20th Century-Fox. The film follows a battle between two wizards of opposing powers, one representing the forces of magic and the other representing the forces of technology.

The film is notable for being the first fantasy film by Bakshi, a filmmaker who was previously known only for &quot;urban films&quot; such as &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972), &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; (1973) and &quot;Coonskin&quot; (1975). The film grossed 9 million theatrically with a $2 million budget.

== Plot ==

Earth has been devastated by a nuclear war. It takes 2 million years for the radioactive clouds to allow sunlight in. The humans who survived the apocalypse have been transformed into mutants, while humanity&#x27;s true ancestors – trolls, fairies, elves and dwarves – resurface and live in the idyllic land of Montagar.

While her people celebrate 3,000 years of peace, Delia, queen of the fairies, falls into a trance and gives birth to twin wizards: the kindhearted Avatar and his evil, mutated brother Blackwolf. After Delia&#x27;s death years later, Blackwolf attempts to usurp her leadership, but Avatar defeats him in a magical duel. Blackwolf leaves Montagar, vowing to return and &quot;make this a planet where mutants rule&quot;.

Three thousand years later, Blackwolf leads the dark land of Scortch, where he and his army of mutants and other evil creatures salvage and restore ancient technology. He tries to attack Montagar twice, but is foiled when his mutant warriors become bored or sidetracked in the midst of battle. Blackwolf then discovers an old projector and reels of Nazi propaganda footage from World War II, using his magic to enhance it for psychological warfare: inspiring his own soldiers while horrifying enemy troops into submission.
Meanwhile, in Montagar, Avatar trains the president&#x27;s daughter, Elinore, to become a full-fledged fairy. Suddenly, the president is assassinated by Necron 99, a robot sent by Blackwolf to kill all believers in magic. Avatar subdues the robot and reconditions it for nonviolence, changing its name to Peace &quot;in the hopes that he will bring it&quot;. Avatar learns from the robot that the &quot;dream machine&quot; – the projector – is Blackwolf&#x27;s secret weapon. Avatar, Elinore, Peace, and the elf warrior Weehawk set out to destroy the projector and save the world from another Holocaust.

In a forest inhabited by fairies, the group is accosted by their leader, Sean. Weehawk realizes that Peace is missing, when an unseen assassin kills Sean resulting in the fairies kidnapping Elinore. Avatar and Weehawk begin to search for Elinore in the forbidden Fairy Sanctuary, but Weehawk falls into a chasm and insists that Avatar leave him and find the girl. Avatar locates her, captured by fairies and small human-like creatures, just as she is about to be killed. Avatar attempts to explain that they did not kill Sean, but the fairies do not believe him and shoot him with an arrow. Wounded in the shoulder, Avatar refuses to fight back, which impresses the fairy king. Instead of executing them, he merely teleports Avatar and Elinore to a snowy mountaintop. Avatar and Elinore resume their journey, but they soon realize that they are wandering in circles. Peace and Weehawk (whom Peace saved from a vicious monster in the chasm) find Avatar and Elinore. Together, they find their way out of the mountains. Soon, Avatar and the others encounter the encamped army of an elf General who is preparing to attack Scortch the following day, but Blackwolf launches a sneak attack that night.

Elinore and Peace are attacked by one of Blackwolf&#x27;s demons which Avatar quickly dispatches. When one of Blackwolf&#x27;s battle tanks arrives to destroy the camp, Elinore unexpectedly kills Peace and climbs into the tank as it drives off.

The next day, Avatar and Weehawk enter Scortch by ship and make for Blackwolf&#x27;s castle, while the General leads his elf warriors in a bloody battle to distract Blackwolf&#x27;s forces. The pair split up, Weehawk tracking Elinore while Avatar goes after Blackwolf. Weehawk nearly kills Elinore, but she explains that Blackwolf had taken control of her mind after she touched Peace. Blackwolf declares his magic superior to Avatar&#x27;s and demands his surrender. Avatar admits that he has not practiced magic for some time, but offers to show Blackwolf a trick that their mother taught him; Avatar then pulls a pistol from his sleeve and shoots Blackwolf dead. Weehawk destroys the projector, leaving the mutants leaderless and helpless as the General&#x27;s army defeats them. With Montagar&#x27;s safety secured, Weehawk returns home as its new ruler, while Avatar and Elinore decide to start their own kingdom elsewhere.

== Production ==

Ralph Bakshi had long had an interest in fantasy and had been drawing fantasy artwork as far back as 1955, while he was still in high school. &quot;Wizards&quot; originated in the concept for &quot;Tee-Witt&quot;, an unproduced television series Bakshi developed and pitched to CBS in 1967. In 1976, Bakshi pitched &quot;War Wizards&quot;, which he wrote in only two weeks, to 20th Century-Fox, returning to the fantasy drawings he had created in high school for inspiration. To make the film PG-rated, Bakshi sought to depart from his more urban-oriented films that deal with topics of sex and drugs but still have a similar impact.

The film is an allegorical comment on the moral ambiguity of technology and the potentially destructive powers of propaganda. Blackwolf&#x27;s secret weapon is propaganda, used to incite his legions and terrorize the fairy folk of Montagar; but Avatar&#x27;s willingness to use a technological tool (a handgun pulled from &quot;up his sleeve&quot;) destroys his evil twin. Bakshi also states that &quot;Wizards&quot; &quot;was about the creation of the state of Israel and the Holocaust, about the Jews looking for a homeland, and about the fact that fascism was on the rise again&quot;.

British illustrator Ian Miller and comic book artist Mike Ploog were hired to contribute backgrounds and designs. The crew included Vita, Turek, Sparey, Vitello and Spence, who had become comfortable with Bakshi&#x27;s limited storyboarding and lack of pencil tests. Artist Alex Niño signed a contract with Bakshi to work on the film, and was granted a work visa, but was unable to gain permission from the Philippine government to leave for the United States until two months afterward, and later found that by the time he had arrived in the United States, not only had the film&#x27;s animation been completed, but Niño&#x27;s visa did not allow him to submit freelance work on any other projects.

The film&#x27;s main cast includes Bob Holt, Jesse Welles, Richard Romanus, David Proval, and Steve Gravers. Bakshi cast Holt based on his ability to imitate the voice of actor Peter Falk, of whom Bakshi is a fan. Welles, Romanus and Proval again worked with Bakshi on &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;, where Romanus and Proval provided the voices of Vinnie and Crazy Shapiro, respectively. Actress Tina Bowman, who plays a small role in &quot;Wizards&quot;, has a larger role in &quot;Hey Good Lookin&#x27;&quot;. Actor Mark Hamill auditioned for and received a voice role in the film. Bakshi states that &quot;He needed a job, and he came to me, and I thought he was great, and [George] Lucas thought he should do it, and he got not only &quot;Wizards&quot;, he got &quot;Star Wars&quot;.&quot; Bakshi had wanted a female narrator for his film, and he loved Susan Tyrrell&#x27;s acting. Tyrrell performed the narration for the film, but Bakshi was told that he couldn&#x27;t credit her for her narration. Years later, Tyrrell told Bakshi that she got most of her later work from her narration on the film, and that she wished she had allowed him to put her name on it.

John Grant writes in his book &quot;Masters of Animation&quot; that &quot;[the] overall affect [sic] of the animation is akin to that of the great anime creators – one has to keep reminding oneself that &quot;Wizards&quot; predates Miyazaki&#x27;s &quot;The Castle of Cagliostro&quot; (1979), not the other way round. [...] The backgrounds [...] are especially lovely, even the simplest of them; and in general the movie has a strong visual &quot;brio&quot; despite occasional technical hurriedness.&quot; Notable artists involved in the production of Wizards include Ian Miller, who produced the gloomy backgrounds of Scortch, and Mike Ploog, who contributed likewise for the more arcadian landscapes of Montagar.

Bakshi was unable to complete the battle sequences with the budget Fox had given him. When he asked them for a budget increase, they refused (during the same meeting, director George Lucas had asked for a budget increase for &quot;Star Wars&quot; and was also refused). As a result, Bakshi finished his film by paying out of his own pocket and using rotoscoping for the unfinished battle sequences. According to Bakshi, &quot;I thought that if we dropped all the detail, it would look very artistic, and very beautiful, and I felt, why bother animating all of this? I&#x27;m looking for a way to get realism into my film and get real emotion.&quot; In his audio commentary for the film&#x27;s DVD release, Bakshi states that &quot;There&#x27;s no question that it was an easier way to get these gigantic scenes that I wanted. It also was the way that showed me how to do &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, so it worked two ways.&quot; In addition to stock footage, the film used battle sequences from films such as &quot;Zulu&quot;, &quot;El Cid&quot;, &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; and &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; for rotoscoping. Live-action sequences from &quot;Patton&quot; were also featured.

Vaughn Bode&#x27;s work has been credited as an influence on &quot;Wizards&quot;. Quentin Tarantino describes Avatar as &quot;a cross between Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;Hobbit&quot;, Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;2000 Year Old Man&quot;, and Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;&quot; and Blackwolf as physically similar to Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Ivan the Terrible&quot;. In Jerry Beck&#x27;s &quot;Animated Movie Guide&quot;, Andrew Leal writes that &quot;The central figure, Avatar [...] sounds a great deal like Peter Falk, and clearly owes much to cartoonist Vaughn Bodé&#x27;s Cheech Wizard character.&quot;

As &quot;War Wizards&quot; neared completion, Lucas requested that Bakshi change the title of his film to &quot;Wizards&quot; in order to avoid conflict with &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and Bakshi agreed because Lucas had allowed Mark Hamill to take time off from &quot;Star Wars&quot; in order to record a voice for &quot;Wizards&quot;.

== Response and legacy ==
Although &quot;Wizards&quot; received a limited release, it was very successful in the theaters that showed it, and developed a worldwide audience. According to Bakshi, he was once interviewed by a German reporter who was unsure as to why the Nazi Swastika was used to represent war. Bakshi said &quot;I didn&#x27;t get any criticism. People pretty much loved &quot;Wizards&quot;.&quot; Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 62%, based on 29 reviews with an average rating of 5.5/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Its central metaphor is a bit too on the nose, but &quot;Wizards&quot; is an otherwise psychedelic, freaky trip into an alternate version of our world.&quot;

A. H. Weiler of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes that the film &quot;evolves, at best, as only a mildly interesting mixture of clashing polemics and shoot-&#x27;em-up melodrama&quot; that &quot;merely restates the already too obvious, dire results of nuclear war and man&#x27;s inhumanity to man.&quot; Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; panned the film as &quot;a confusing melange of melodrama, allegory and limp polemic. The animation technique is excellent in a professional sense, but neither story nor music ever really gets interesting.&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s &quot;Wizards&quot;, although good-looking, isn&#x27;t magical enough. Although it&#x27;s a futuristic fairy-tale, it frequently interrupts its narrative with contemporary jokes. The jokes remind us we&#x27;re watching a movie while calling into question the sincerity of the film itself.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was generally positive, writing: &quot;Whatever else it is, &#x27;Wizards&#x27; is a feast for the eyes, a nonstop succession of imaginings and imageries that are beautiful, startling funny, powerfully ominous, classically cartoonish, visions of heaven and hellfire ... It is hypnotically interesting for those who are addicted to animation but hardly less so to those who are plenty satisfied with Tom and Jerry.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the film a &quot;dim animated novelty&quot; that was &quot;conspicuously lacking in narrative momentum. Even when the graphics and draughtsmanship seem clever, they embellish the most negligible of scenarios.&quot; Richard Combs of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;What emerges from this mish-mash of material is a predictable confusion of sentiment and cynicism: Bakshi seems uncertain whether to try for the full other-worldly magic of Tolkien or to treat the whole thing as camp (the tone of the flower-child fairy-tale narrator strongly suggests the latter).&quot;

Ken Whitman&#x27;s company Whit Publications published the tabletop role-playing game &quot;Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s Wizards&quot; in 1992.

20th Century Fox Home Entertainment responded to an online petition created by Animation on DVD.com and written by Keith Finch demanding the film&#x27;s release on DVD. The disc, released on May 25, 2004, featured an audio commentary track by Bakshi and the interview segment &quot;Ralph Bakshi: The Wizard of Animation&quot;. Bakshi has stated that &quot;Wizards&quot; was always intended as a trilogy. One of the sequels was pitched to Fox, who did not greenlight the project.

20th Century Fox released a Special Edition Blu-ray Disc of the film on March 13, 2012, to commemorate the film&#x27;s 35th anniversary. The disc includes the special features from the DVD, along with a 24-page book including rare artwork from the film and an introduction from Bakshi.

== Possible sequel ==
Bakshi mentioned he had plans for a sequel entitled &quot;Wizards 2&quot; that involved the relationship between Avatar and Elinore. Bakshi said the plot would be &quot;where [their relationship] doesn&#x27;t work out, and Weehawk gets in the way.&quot; The sequel was never developed due to production difficulties and the other projects on which Bakshi was then focused.

In late 2004, a &quot;Wizards II&quot; graphic novel went into production, produced by Bakshi. The stories were to be from the Wizards &quot;universe&quot; and each story would be created by a different artist. In September 2008, it was announced that Main Street Pictures would collaborate with Bakshi on a sequel to &quot;Wizards&quot;.

In 2015, Bakshi stated that he had a script finished and hoped to have it be his next film. In a November interview, while promoting &quot;Last Days of Coney Island,&quot; Bakshi stated that &quot;Wizards 2&quot; is about &quot;madness, absolute madness!&quot;

<text>James Samuel Coleman (May 12, 1926 – March 25, 1995) was an American sociologist, theorist, and empirical researcher, based chiefly at the University of Chicago.

He served as president of the American Sociological Association in 1991–1992. He studied the sociology of education and public policy, and was one of the earliest users of the term social capital. He may be considered one of the original neoconservatives in sociology. His work &quot;Foundations of Social Theory&quot; (1990) influenced countless sociological theories, and his works &quot;The Adolescent Society&quot; (1961) and &quot;Coleman Report&quot; (&quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot;, 1966) were two of the most cited books in educational sociology. The landmark Coleman Report helped transform educational theory, reshape national education policies, and it influenced public and scholarly opinion regarding the role of schooling in determining equality and productivity in the United States.

==Early life==
As the son of James and Maurine Coleman, he spent his early childhood in Bedford, Indiana, he then moved to Louisville, Kentucky. After graduating in 1944, he enrolled in a small school in Virginia, but left to enlist in the US Navy during World War II. After he was discharged from the US Navy in 1946, he enrolled in Indiana University. Eventually he transferred schools, and Coleman received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering from Purdue University in 1949. He initially intended on studying Chemistry but quickly became fascinated with Sociology as he navigated his way through University life. He began working at Eastman Kodak until 1952. He became interested in sociology and pursued his degree at Columbia University. During his time there, he spent two years as a research assistant with the Bureau of Applied Social Research, and published a chapter in &quot;Mathematical Thinking in the Social Sciences&quot;, which was edited by Paul Lazarsfeld. He went on to receive his doctorate from Columbia University in 1955.

He is best known today for his work on the massive study that produced &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot; (EEO), or the Coleman Report, Coleman&#x27;s intellectual appetite was prodigious.
In 1949 he married Lucille Richey with whom he had 3 children, Thomas, John, and Stephen. Lucille and James divorced in 1973 and he later went on to marry his second wife, Zdzislawa Walaszek, in which he had one son, Daniel Coleman. He died on March 25, 1995, at University Hospital in Chicago Illinois and was outlived by his wife Zdzislawa Walaszek and sons. 

==Career==
Coleman achieved success with two studies on problem solving: &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Sociology&quot; (1964) and &quot;Mathematics of Collective Action&quot; (1973). He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and taught at the University of Chicago. In 1959, he moved to Johns Hopkins University, where he served as an associate professor and founded the Sociology department. In 1965 he became involved in Project Camelot, an academic research project funded by the United States military through the Special Operations Research Office to train in counter-insurgency techniques. He eventually became a professor in social relations until 1973, when he returned to Chicago to teach as a University Professor of Sociology and Education at the University of Chicago again.

During the mid-1960s and early 1970s, Coleman was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the United States National Academy of Sciences.
Proceeding on the assumption that the study of human society can become a true science, the author examines the contribution that various mathematical techniques might make to systematic conceptual elaboration of social behavior. He notes that it is only when the logical structure of mathematics is possible, and claims that in this way mathematics will ultimately become useful in sociology.

Upon his return, he became the professor and senior study director at the National Opinion Research Center. In 1991, Coleman was elected as the eighty-third President of the American Sociological Association. In 2001, Coleman was named among the top 100 American intellectuals, as measured by academic citations, in Richard Posner&#x27;s book, &quot;Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline.&quot; Over his lifetime he published nearly 30 books, and more than 300 articles and book chapters, which contributed to the understanding of education in the United States.

He was influenced by Ernest Nagel and Paul Lazarsfeld, both who interested Coleman in mathematical sociology, and Robert Merton, who introduced Coleman to Émile Durkheim and Max Weber. Coleman is associated with adolescence, corporate action and rational choice. He shares common ground with sociologists Peter Blau, Daniel Bell, and Seymour Martin Lipset, with whom Coleman first did research after obtaining his PhD.

==Major contributions==
===Coleman Report===
Coleman is widely cited in the field of sociology of education. In the 1960s, during his time teaching at Johns Hopkins University, Coleman and several other scholars were commissioned by the National Center for Education Statistics to write a report on educational equality in the US. It was one of the largest studies in history, with more than 650,000 students in the sample. The result was a massive report of over 700 pages. The 1966 report, titled &quot;Equality of Educational Opportunity&quot; (otherwise known as the &quot;Coleman Report&quot;), fueled debates about &quot;school effects&quot; that are still relevant today. The report is commonly presented as evidence that school funding has little effect on student achievement, a key finding of the report and subsequent research. It was found as for physical facilities, formal curricula, and other measurable criteria, there was little difference between black and white schools. Also, a significant gap in the achievement scores between black and white children already existed in the first grade. Despite the similar conditions of black and white schools, the gap became even wider by the end of elementary school. The only consistent variable explaining the differences in score within each racial group or ethnic group was the educational and economic attainment of the parents. Therefore, student background and socioeconomic status were found to be more important in determining educational outcomes of a student. Specifically, the key factors were the attitudes toward education of parents and caregivers at home and peers at school. Differences in the quality of schools and teachers did have a small impact on student outcomes.

The study cost approximately 1.5 million dollars and to date is one of the largest studies in history, involving 600,000 students and 60,000 teachers in the research sample. The participants were black, Native, and Mexican American, poor white, Puerto Rican and Asian students. This study was a driving factor in the debate for “school effects”, a debate that continues to date. A few major findings and controversies from the study were that black student drop rates were twice as high that of white students, and that poor home environments were a major influence to poor academic performance for minorities.

Eric Hanushek criticized the focus on the statistical methodology and the estimation of the impacts of various factors on achievement which took attention away from the achievement comparisons in the Coleman Report. The study tested students around United States, and the differences in achievement by race and region were enormous. The average black twelfth grade student in the rural South was achieving at the level of a seventh grade white student in the urban Northeast. At the fiftieth anniversary of the report&#x27;s publication, Eric Hanushek assessed the closure in the black-white achievement gap. He found that achievement differences had narrowed, largely from improvements in the South, but that at the pace of the previous half-century, it would take two-and-a-half centuries to close the mathematics achievement gap.

===Social capital===
In &quot;Foundations of Social Theory&quot; (1990), Coleman discusses his theory of social capital, the set of resources found in family relations and in a community&#x27;s social organization. Coleman believed that social capital is important for the development of a child or young person, and that functional communities are important as sources of social capital that can support families in terms of youth development. He discusses three main types of capital: human, physical, and social.

Human capital is an individual&#x27;s skills, knowledge, and experience, which determine their value in society. Physical capital, being completely tangible and generally a private good, originates from the creation of tools to facilitate production. In addition to social capital, the three types of investments create the three main aspects of society&#x27;s exchange of capital.

According to Coleman, social capital and human capital are often go hand in hand with one another. By having certain skill sets, experiences, and knowledge, an individual can gain social status and so receive more social capital.

“The interrogation by his colleague was likely very difficult to navigate as Coleman was a man who was opposed to segregation. It is known that when Coleman and his wife Lucille Richey brought their three children John, Tom, and Steve to a white only amusement park, outside of Baltimore. They attempted to enter the park with a black family and as anticipated were arrested along with approximately 300 other demonstrators”. 

==Legacy==
Coleman was a pioneer in the construction of mathematical models in sociology with his book, &quot;Introduction to Mathematical Sociology&quot; (1964). His later treatise, &quot;Foundations of Social Theory&quot; (1990), made major contributions toward a more rigorous form of theorizing in sociology based on rational choice. Coleman wrote more than thirty books and 300 articles. He also created an educational corporation that developed and marketed &quot;mental games&quot; aimed at improving the abilities of disadvantaged students. Coleman made it a practice to send his most controversial research findings &quot;to his worst critics&quot; prior to their publication, calling it &quot;the best way to ensure validity.&quot;

At the time of his death, he was engaged in a long-term study titled the &quot;High School and Beyond&quot;, which examined the lives and careers of 75,000 people who had been high school juniors and seniors in 1980.

“In 1966, James Coleman presented a report to the U.S Congress where he presented his findings from his research where he spoke of how to reach a racial balance in public schools. He shared his most controversial findings that poor black children did better academically when integrated into middle-class schools”. 

Coleman published lasting theories of education, which helped shape the field. With his focus on the allocation of rights, one can understand the conflict between rights. Towards the end of his life, Coleman questioned how to make the education systems more accountable, which caused educators to question their use and interpretation of standardized testing.

Coleman&#x27;s publication of the &quot;Coleman Report&quot; included greatly influential findings that pioneered aspects of the desegregation of American public schools. His theories of integration also contributed. He also raised the issue of narrowing the educational gap between those who had money and others. By creating a well-rounded student body, a student&#x27;s educational experience can be greatly benefited.

With Coleman&#x27;s many shocking findings and conclusions that were drawn from his research, many of the people who were interested and trusted his research including Coleman himself were reluctant to follow them as time passed. Coleman&#x27;s later studies suggested that desegregation efforts via busing failed due to “white flight” from areas in which students were bussed. 

Coleman integrated himself into a teacher lifestyle with the intention of sharing his passion for sociology and continuing his legacy despite his difficulty after his failed research. Having been one of the pioneers in mathematical sociology, it was not uncommon for people to ask Coleman to review papers submitted to various scholarly journals. He had little time on his hands as a well-known sociologist in the United States, in turn he built a seminar on the mathematics of sociology to build more people with the capability and education necessary to broaden and strengthen the field.

<text>Ratu () is an Austronesian title used by male Fijians of chiefly rank. An equivalent title, adi (pronounced ), is used by females of chiefly rank. In the Malay language, the title &quot;ratu&quot; is also the traditional honorific title to refer to the ruling king or queen in Javanese culture (though it has since been used in modern contexts to refer to both queen regnant and queen consort of any nation, e.g. &quot;Ratu Elizabeth II&quot; and &quot;Ratu Camilla&quot;). Thus in Java, a royal palace is called &quot;keraton&quot;, constructed from the circumfix &quot;ke- -an&quot; and &quot;Ratu&quot;, to describe the residence of the ratu.

Ratu: A chiefly title for men used alone as a form of address, or in front of the chief&#x27;s name, only in certain places The source of the Fijian title is Verata, and it has spread throughout Fiji during the past century, now applied to many local, minor chiefs as well as the major ones. The concept of his type of title is from Tonga. Strictly speaking, the title belongs only in Verata. In their time, Cakobau or Tanoa, his father, never themselves used the title of Ratu. It does not appear with Cakobau&#x27;s name or any other chief&#x27;s name in the Deed of Cession of 1874. (Exceptionally, in the 1850s, Ratu Mara Kapaiwai was one of the few who did use the word Ratu, though that may have been a name rather than a title.) It has been affixed to the names of Tana and Cakobau by later Fijians, retroactively. The Cakobau Memorial Church on Bau Island is now referred to as the Ratu Cakobau Church. Ratu may also be used as a personal first name or second name. The title may be acquired as part of a chiefly name, by a namesake. In such cases, it does not imply chiefly status. Adi is the female equivalent, sometimes heard as Yadi in Lau.

==Etymology==
&quot;Ra&quot; is a prefix in many titles (&quot;ramasi, ramalo, rasau, ravunisa, ratu&quot;), and &quot;tu&quot; means simply &quot;chief&quot;. The formal use of &quot;ratu&quot; as a title in a name (as in &quot;Sir&quot; in British tradition) was not introduced until after the cession of 1874. Until then, a chief would be known only by his birth name and his area-specific traditional title.

Regional variations include &quot;ro&quot; in Rewa and parts of Naitasiri and Tailevu, &quot;roko&quot; in parts of Naitasiri, Rewa and Lau (particularly the Moala group), &quot;ra&quot; in parts of Vanua Levu, particularly the province of Bua.

In all those places, it is used as a title preceding the person&#x27;s name, much like &quot;prince&quot;, &quot;duke&quot;, &quot;earl&quot;, &quot;baron&quot; or &quot;lord&quot;.

The semantics, however, are a little different in Fijian although the name and title are usually reversed, for example:

In English, one would say &quot;His Royal Highness&quot; (Styling) &quot;Prince&quot; (address/title) Andrew (name), &quot;Duke of York&quot; (noble title).

In Fijian, one would say, &quot;Gone Turaga Na&quot; (Styling) &quot;Roko Tui Bau&quot; (noble title), Ratu (address/title) Joni Madraiwiwi (name).

==Fijian nobility==
The Fijian nobility consists of about seventy chiefs, each of whom descends from a family that has traditionally ruled a certain area. The chiefs are of differing rank, with some chiefs traditionally subordinate to other chiefs. The Vusaratu clan is regarded as the highest chiefly clan, with regards to the people of Bau until the rise of the Tui Kaba clan leader, who exiled all Vusaratu members. They are the heirs of Ratu Seru Epenisa Cakobau, the &quot;Vunivalu&quot; of Bau or &quot;Tui Levuka&quot; (Paramount Chief of Bau, on the eastern side of Viti Levu, Fiji&#x27;s most populous island), He proclaimed himself &quot;Tui Viti/King of Fiji&quot; in 1871. (He was only recognised by the British and a few provinces of Viti Levu)
He along with 12 high Chiefs subsequently ceded the islands to the United Kingdom in 1874.

Other prominent chiefly clans include the Vuanirewa (the traditional rulers of the Lau Islands) and the Ai So&#x27;ula (the traditional rulers of Vanua Levu).

During the colonial rule (1874–1970), the British kept Fiji&#x27;s traditional chiefly structure and worked through it. They established what was to become the Great Council of Chiefs, originally an advisory body, but it grew into a powerful constitutional institution. Constitutionally, it functions as an electoral college to choose Fiji&#x27;s president (a largely honorary position modelled on the British monarchy), the vice-president, and 14 of the 32 senators, members of Parliament&#x27;s &quot;upper house&quot;, which has a veto over most legislation. The 18 other senators are appointed by the Prime Minister (9), the Leader of the Opposition (8), and the Council of Rotuma (1); these appointees may, or may not, be of chiefly rank also. (The Senate was modelled on Britain&#x27;s House of Lords, which consists of both hereditary and life peers.)

The presidency, vice-presidency, and fourteen senators are the only constitutional offices whose appointment is controlled by persons of chiefly rank. Chiefs in post-independence Fiji have always competed for parliamentary seats on an equal footing with commoners. In the years following independence, this favored the chiefly class, as the common people looked to them as their leaders and generally voted for them. For several elections, many ethnic Fijian members of the House, which is elected by universal suffrage, were of chiefly rank, but in recent elections, the discrepancy between chiefs and commoners is slowly narrowing, as commoners are becoming better educated and have begun to work their way into the power structure. The chiefs, however, retain enormous respect among the Fijian people. In times of crisis, such as the coups of 1987 and the third coup of 2000, the Great Council of Chiefs often stepped in to provide leadership when the modern political institutions have broken down.

<text>Piper Alpha was an oil platform located in the North Sea about north-east of Aberdeen, Scotland. It was operated by Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Limited (OPCAL) and began production in December 1976, initially as an oil-only platform, but later converted to add gas production.

Piper Alpha exploded and collapsed under the effect of sustained gas jet fires in the night between 6 and 7 July 1988, killing 165 of the men on board (30 of whose bodies were never recovered), as well as a further two rescuers. Sixty-one workers escaped and survived. The total insured loss was about £1.7 billion (£ billion in ), making it one of the costliest man-made catastrophes ever. At the time of the disaster, the platform accounted for roughly 10% of North Sea oil and gas production and was the world’s single largest oil producer. The accident is the worst ever offshore oil and gas disaster in terms of lives lost, and comparable only to the &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; disaster in terms of industry impact. The inquiry blamed it on inadequate maintenance and safety procedures by Occidental, though no charges were brought. A separate civil suit resulted in a finding of negligence against two workers who were killed in the accident.

A memorial sculpture is located in the Rose Garden of Hazlehead Park in Aberdeen.

==Piper oilfield==
Four companies (Occidental Petroleum (UK) Ltd, Getty Oil International (England) Ltd, Allied Chemical (Great Britain) Ltd, and Thomson Scottish Associates Ltd) formed a joint venture and obtained an oil-exploration licence in 1972. They discovered the Piper oilfield located at in January 1973, and began fabrication of the platform, pipelines, and onshore support structures. Oil production started in December 1976, less than four years after discovery (a record rarely beaten ever since), with about of oil per day, later increasing to . Production declined to by 1988.

A large, fixed platform, Piper Alpha was located in the Piper oilfield, around northeast of Aberdeen in of water. Piper Alpha produced crude oil and natural gas from 36 wells. OPCAL built the Flotta oil terminal in the Orkney Islands to receive and process oil from the Piper, Claymore (both operated by OPCAL), and Tartan (Texaco) oilfields, each with its own platform. One diameter main oil pipeline ran from Piper Alpha to Flotta.

The Piper platform was the hub of a network of pipelines connecting it to nearby platforms and to shore. The Tartan field fed oil to Claymore, with the co-mingled oil flowing from Claymore through a short pipeline to join the Piper-Flotta line some to the west of Piper.

Separate diameter gas pipelines were run from the Tartan platform to Piper, and from Piper to the Total-operated manifold compression platform MCP-01 some to the northwest. Another line connected Claymore to Piper, primarily to provide gas from Piper to the Claymore gas lift system. MCP-01 would receive the gas from Piper and Tartan, as well as from the Frigg gas field (through a separate pipeline), and send the resulting stream to St Fergus Gas Terminal through a , 2 × 32-inch pipeline.

The inventory of the pipelines was significant, with the main oil line to Flotta containing around 70,000 tonnes of oil and the three gas lines linking Piper to the surrounding platforms close to 2,000 tonnes of high-pressure gas. The pressure in the Tartan–Piper and Piper–MCP-01 pipelines was around 127 bar.

==Construction and layout==

Piper Alpha&#x27;s production facilities were designed by Bechtel in London. The supporting platform jacket, as well as the topside module structures and buildings, were designed by McDermott Hudson. The eight-legged jacket structure was constructed by J. Ray McDermott in Ardersier, Inverness-shire, and Union Industrielle et d&#x27;Entreprise in Le Havre, France, with the sections united in Ardersier before being towed out during 1975. The jacket weighed around 14,000 tonnes and was tall, of which a length of was permanently submerged. Four clusters of foundation piles extended a further below the seabed. Topside modules weighing about 10,000 tonnes in aggregate were lifted from a crane ship and installed over the jacket in late 1976.

Piper&#x27;s hydrocarbon facilities and principal utilities were distributed in four main modules (A, B, C, and D) separated by firewalls and sitting atop the steel jacket. Above the main modules were a drilling derrick, various utilities, the living quarters, flare booms, two pedestal cranes, and the helideck.

For safety reasons, the modules were organized so that the most dangerous platform operations took place far from the personnel areas. However, the conversion from oil to gas broke this safety concept, with the result that sensitive areas were brought together; for example, the gas compression module was next to the control room. The close position of these two areas played a significant role in the accident.

The hydrocarbon inventory actually held within the platform was small in comparison with that contained in the pipelines, standing at around 80 tonnes of process fluids and 160 tonnes of diesel fuel (which was stored in tanks located above module C).

==Upgrades and production modes==

In 1978, major works were carried out to enable the platform to meet British government gas-conservation requirements, and to avoid waste from the flaring of excess gas. A gas conservation module (GCM) was added, built on top of module B. After this work, Piper Alpha operated in what was known as &quot;phase-2 mode&quot;, i.e., using the GCM facility. In phase-2 mode, the GCM would treat the gas obtained in the crude oil separation process, separate condensate (or natural gas liquids, NGL) from it, reinject the condensate in the oil export pipeline to Flotta, and compress the gas for export to the pipeline to MCP-01. From the end of 1980 until July 1988, phase-2 mode was its normal operating state.

In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance, and upgrade works were planned by Occidental, and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major revamp, with six projects identified, including the change-out of the GCM unit. This meant that the rig was returned to its initial &quot;phase-1 mode&quot;, i.e., operating without the GCM unit, only three days before the accident. Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase-1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. At the time of the accident, Piper weighed around 34,000 tonnes. It continued to export oil at just under per day (or 10% of the entire production of the UK sector of the North Sea, which made it the world’s single largest oil producer) and to export Tartan gas at some per day at standard conditions during this period.

==Events on 6 and 7 July 1988 ==
Because the platform was completely destroyed, and many of those involved died, analysis of events can only suggest a possible chain of events based on known facts. Some witnesses to the events question the official timeline.

=== Preliminary events ===
At 07:45, 6 July 1988, the permit-to-work forms for the day shift were issued and signed. Of the two condensate pumps, both located in module C, pump B was operating to displace the platform&#x27;s condensate for transport to the coast, while pump A was due for maintenance. Two permits were issued to that effect, one for a pump overhaul and another for the removal of the pump&#x27;s pressure safety valve (PSV #504), which was due for recertification. During the day, pump A was electrically and mechanically isolated, but containment was not broken. The PSV, instead, was removed. The open condensate pipe upstream of the PSV was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (a flat metal disc also called a blind flange or blank flange). It was hand-tightened only. Because the work could not be completed by 18:00, the blind flange remained in place. The on-duty engineer filled in information on the PSV removal permit to the effect that pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances. However, this information was not provided in the pump overhaul permit.

The night shift started at 18:00 with 62 men running Piper Alpha. As the on-duty custodian was busy, the engineer neglected to inform him of the condition of pump A. Instead, he placed the PSV permit in the control centre and left. This permit disappeared and was not found.

At 19:00 the diesel-driven fire pumps were put under manual control. Like many other offshore platforms, Piper Alpha had an automatic fire-fighting system, driven by both diesel and electric fire pumps. The pumps were designed to suck in large amounts of sea water for firefighting and had automatic controls to start them in case of fire. However, the Piper Alpha procedure adopted by the offshore installation manager (OIM) required manual control of the diesel pumps whenever divers were in the water (as they were for about 12 hours a day during summer) although in reality, the risk was not seen as significant, unless a diver was closer than from any of the four level caged intakes. A recommendation from an earlier audit had suggested that a procedure be developed to keep the pumps in automatic mode if divers were not working in the vicinity of the intakes, as was the practice on the Claymore platform, but this was never implemented.

At 21:45, condensate pump B stopped and could not be restarted. This was likely due to the formation of hydrates and the consequent blockage of gas compression pipework, following problems with the methanol system. The operators were anxious to reinstate condensate pumping capacity. Failure to do so would have meant needing to stop the gas compressors and venting to the flare all the gas that could not be processed.

Around 21:52 a search was made through the documents to determine whether condensate pump A could be started. The permit for pump A overhaul was found but that for its PSV removal was not. The valve was at a distance from the pump, so the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. Because the overhaul had just started on the day, with no equipment removed or containment broken, the operators were under the impression that the pump could be put back in operation quickly and safely. None of those present were aware that a vital part of the machine had been removed. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the blind flange replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obstructed from view.

===Explosion in module C and initial reactions===
At or shortly before 22:00, gas was reintroduced into pump A, filling it. The loosely fitted flange did not withstand the resulting pressure. Gas audibly leaked out at high pressure, drawing the attention of several men and triggering multiple gas alarms. Before anyone could act, the gas ignited and exploded. The source of ignition is unclear, with the later investigation pointing to hot work, hot surfaces, broken light fittings or an electrostatic spark as potential sources (electrical equipment in the surroundings were rated for hazardous areas). The platform, which originally was built for oil production only, was not of a blast-proof design, so the firewalls were not designed to withstand explosions. The blast blew through the firewalls separating module C from the adjoining modules B and D (the latter of which housed the control room), made up of variously sized panels bolted together. As a result, the control room was almost entirely destroyed. Panels around module B were also dislodged, with one of them rupturing a small condensate pipe, thus creating another fire.

Immediately after the explosion, control room operator Geoff Bollands, who had witnessed the alarms going off in the control room and subsequently survived the blast, activated the rig&#x27;s emergency stop button before escaping. This closed isolation valves in the wells and sea riser lines and ceased all oil and gas production. Theoretically, the platform would then have been isolated from the flow of oil and gas and the fire contained. The gas pipelines connecting Piper to Tartan and Claymore could only be isolated using separate push buttons, which were not actuated; however, the riser isolation valves probably closed due to loss of power supply in the explosion. (At any rate, the flare continued to burn until 23:30, indicating a leak in the Claymore riser isolation valve.)

The control room of Piper Alpha was abandoned. The rig&#x27;s design made no allowances for the destruction of the control room, and the platform&#x27;s organization disintegrated. As the diesel fire pumps had been switched to manual activation, the fire water system could not function properly. Additionally, their vulnerable location in module D, adjacent to the failed division from module C, was impossible to reach for the crew to manually activate them. Electrical power quickly failed too, as cables were routed through vulnerable production areas without redundancy. After the main generator tripped, the emergency generator did not take over. The drilling generator started but subsequently failed. Some battery-run systems remained operational for a while. The emergency lighting failed after briefly remaining functional. The failure of power generation facilities also made the electric fire pumps inoperable. Despite Bollands&#x27; activation of the emergency shutdown, no alarms warned workers of the unfolding disaster, as the public announcement and general alarm system had been impaired. Multiple mayday calls were made by radio operator David Kinrade starting at 22:04, before the radio room had to be abandoned at 22:08.

At 22:06 the heat from the flames ruptured crude oil pipework and processing vessels in module B. The released oil ignited and the subsequent pool fire created a black plume of smoke characteristic of oil fires, visible from nearby ships. There is evidence that isolation of the produced oil pipeline was not effective, which may have left a route open for oil flowing into the fire due to the backpressure from the Claymore oil pipeline. The burning oil later dripped onto a lower platform used by the rig for diving operations. The platform floor consisted of steel grates, and under normal circumstances would have allowed the burning oil to drip harmlessly into the sea, but divers on the previous shift had placed rubber matting on the metal grate (likely to cushion their bare feet from the sharp metal grates), allowing the oil to form a burning puddle on the platform. After conferring with Bollands and others while still on the main production deck, lead production operator Robert Vernon and safety officer Robert Carroll donned breathing apparatus and left for the diesel fire pumps in an attempt to start them manually. The pair were never to be seen again.

The OIMs of Tartan and Claymore shortly before 22:20 became aware that an explosion had taken place on Piper Alpha and a fire was raging. However, they both decided not to shut down production and instead await orders to that effect from Aberdeen. By this time, 70 to 80 men had mustered in the canteen, with access to the lifeboats or the helideck made impossible by smoke and fire. This room was becoming increasingly hot and full of smoke. Piper&#x27;s OIM did not order an evacuation.

===Subsequent gas pipeline ruptures and platform collapse===
At 22:20, in a case of domino effect, the heat from the burning oil collecting on the diving platform caused the nearby Tartan pipeline to rupture violently. This discharged enormous amounts of highly flammable gas (some 30 tonnes only in the first minute of the release), which immediately ignited into a massive jet fire. The heat and vibrations of the fire were felt by the crews in vessels as far away as from the rig. From that moment on, the platform&#x27;s destruction was inevitable. This potential for an extreme escalation scenario was known to Occidental; a report commissioned by them in 1986 stated that &quot;the gas pipelines, would take hours to depressurize because of their capacity. This could result in a high pressure gas fire on the cellar deck that would be virtually impossible to fight, and the protection systems would not be effective in providing the cooling needed for the duration of the depressurisation&quot;.

The MCP-01 pipeline failed at 22:50 as a result of domino effect, and the ensuing jet fire shot huge flames over into the air. Personnel still left alive were either desperately sheltering in the scorched, smoke-filled accommodation block or leaping from the various deck levels, including the helideck, into the North Sea.

The Claymore gas line ruptured at 23:20, adding even more fuel to the already massive jet fires on board Piper Alpha. At this point the Claymore OIM had received orders from Aberdeen to shut down production, and the gas flowline to Piper with it. He had initiated a pipeline blowdown (depressurization) but this was not yet complete at the moment of the rupture. Tartan&#x27;s gas pipeline had been shut down around 22:30, with its blowdown commencing around 23:20.

Around 23:45, with critical support structures failing from the intense heat, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes fell first, followed by the drilling derrick. The generation and utilities module (D) and the fireproofed accommodation block, still occupied by crewmen who had sheltered there, then slipped into the North Sea. By 00:45, 7 July, almost all of Piper Alpha was gone, with only module A still standing.

== Rescue operations ==

=== Nearby vessels and rescue crafts ===

Vessels that were close to Piper Alpha at the moment of the first explosion included MSV &quot;Tharos&quot;, a large semi-submersible firefighting, diving/rescue, and accommodation vessel; standby safety vessel MV &quot;Silver Pit&quot;, who immediately sent her fast rescue boat towards Piper; &quot;Maersk Cutter&quot;, which started dousing the drilling floor of Piper with her fire monitors as early as ten minutes after the blast; &quot;Lowland Cavalier&quot;, which had no monitors but immediately deployed a workboat; and converted supply ship &quot;Sandhaven&quot;, which was the standby vessel for &quot;Santa Fe 135&quot;, a semi-submersible drilling rig several miles away, and had her fast rescue craft in the water minutes after she spotted the first fire on Piper Alpha. Other vessels that attended the operation later were &quot;Loch Shuna&quot;, &quot;Maersk Logger&quot; and &quot;Maersk Leader&quot;. Overall, 11 fast rescue crafts (FRC) from nearby vessels were involved in the rescue operations.

&quot;Tharos&quot; launched her Sikorsky S-76 helicopter at 22:11 but it was unable to land on Piper due to smoke. At 22:23 &quot;Tharos&quot; received a message from Piper: &quot;People majority in galley area. &quot;Tharos&quot; come. Gangway. Hoses. Getting bad.&quot; She drew alongside Piper Alpha around 22:30 and used her water cannon to cool the platform, which was useful in assisting survivors escape from the pipe deck and helideck. Attempts to deploy her extendable gangway over to Piper were unsuccessful. One survivor who jumped when the Tartan riser failed swam to &quot;Tharos&quot; and climbed out unaided. When the MCP-01 riser failed, &quot;Tharos&quot; withdrew to away. The MSV was equipped with a hospital with an offshore medic assisted by diver paramedics from a saturation diving team. A triage and reception area were set up on the vessel&#x27;s helideck to receive injured casualties.

&quot;Silver Pit&quot;&#x27;s FRC was launched within two minutes of the first explosion and rescued the first nine people from the northwest corner within 13 minutes. She rescued a total of 29 people, with &quot;Silver Pit&quot; herself rescuing a further eight. When the Tartan riser failed &quot;Silver Pit&quot; withdrew to away. When the MCP-01 riser failed, rope on the deck began to smoulder and the vessel withdrew further away.

&quot;Lowland Cavalier&quot; deployed a workboat that picked up two people who had fallen from a rope at the northwest corner. When the first gas riser failed, the workboat crew sheltered in the water.

&quot;Sandhaven&quot;&#x27;s FRC picked up four men who had climbed down ropes. She returned and picked up two more when the MCP-01 riser failed. At that moment, the craft&#x27;s propeller got entangled in debris. The boat was engulfed in the fire, throwing the survivors and the three crew into the water. All perished with the exception of coxswain Iain Letham. He was picked up from the sea one hour later with his lifejacket and safety helmet melted by the scorching heat.

Support vessel &quot;Maersk Cutter&quot; began using her fire monitors ten minutes after the explosion.

=== Aircraft ===

A mayday launched by &quot;Lowland Cavalier&quot; at 22:01 was relayed to a rescue coordination centre, which instructed RAF Kinloss station to scramble a Hawker Siddeley Nimrod maritime patrol aircraft. This was to be sent to the area to act as flying communications platform, handling the signals from helicopters and reporting them back. At 22:22 and 22:28 Sea King helicopters &quot;Rescue 137&quot; and &quot;Rescue 131&quot; took off from RAF Lossiemouth and RAF Boulmer respectively. Shetland Coastguard helicopter &quot;Rescue 117&quot; took off at 22:45. Sea King &quot;Rescue 138&quot; left Lossiemouth at 22:51. The Nimrod took off from Kinloss at 22:55 using the designation &quot;Rescue 01&quot;.

When &quot;Rescue 01&quot; was still about from Piper, the aircraft crew radioed the rescue coordination centre that they could already see the fire. &quot;Rescue 01&quot; arrived at the scene at 23:27. Three minutes later the first search-and-rescue helicopter, &quot;Rescue 137&quot;, reached &quot;Tharos,&quot; followed by the arrival of &quot;Rescue 117&quot;, &quot;Rescue 138&quot; and &quot;Rescue 131&quot; at 23:44, 23:48 and 23:53 hours respectively. &quot;Tharos&quot; requested &quot;Rescue 138&quot; to evacuate 12 nonessential personnel to make room for incoming casualties. The helicopter transferred them to nearby &quot;Ocean Victory&quot;, before returning with paramedics. The search-and-rescue helicopters made unsuccessful sweeps for survivors in the water and ferried injured survivors from rescue vessels to &quot;Tharos&quot; and to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.

A civilian Sikorsky S-61 of Bristow Helicopters carrying a medical emergency team arrived at the scene by 1:20 on 7 July. At 2:00 another helicopter landed on &quot;Tharos&quot; the Offshore Specialist Team from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, with a significant amount of medical equipment. The last survivors were picked up by &quot;Rescue 138&quot; from &quot;Tharos&quot; at 7:25. By 8:15, 63 personnel (among whom one survivor who subsequently died and the surviving member of the crew of &quot;Sandhaven&quot;&#x27;s FRC) had been brought ashore. Aircraft were used to search the area of the platform until the afternoon hours.

== Casualties and survivors ==
At the time of the disaster, 226 people were on the platform; 165 died and 61 survived. Two men from &quot;Sandhaven&quot; were also killed in attempts to pick up survivors in a fast rescue boat. Of the 135 deceased whose bodies were recovered, the vast majority died from inhalation of smoke and gas, with only four indicating death from burning, and several others from injury sustained from jumping into the sea. Thirty bodies were never recovered.

Since both the lifeboats and the helideck were impaired by smoke or flames, all the survivors were among those that jumped to the water from various decks or climbed down knotted ropes. Five were the survivors that jumped off the helideck from a height of into the North Sea. Luckily, the sea conditions were calm on the evening of the disaster. The largest number of survivors (37 out of 61) were recovered by MV &quot;Silver Pit&quot; or her fast rescue boat, whose coxswain James Clark later received the George Medal, as did Iain Letham of the &quot;Sandhaven&quot;. Others awarded the George Medal were Charles Haffey from Methil, Andrew Kiloh from Aberdeen, and James McNeill from Oban. &quot;Sandhaven&quot; crewmates Malcolm Storey, from Alness, and Brian Batchelor, from Scunthorpe, were awarded George Medals posthumously.

==Aftermath==
Controversy exists about whether time was sufficient for a more effective emergency evacuation. Systems critical for emergency management such as the public announcement/general alarm, emergency power, safe haven, and—crucially—the lifeboats, were destroyed or impaired due to poor platform design. Executing the actions described in the emergency response plan became effectively impossible. Additionally, the OIM was perhaps not capable of thinking outside the established procedures and of ordering an improvised evacuation.

It was estimated that the fires had produced flames with a height of about 200 metres and a peak rate of about 100 gigawatts, or three times the total power consumption of the United Kingdom.

Around 670 tonnes of oil were spilled in the accident. On 9 July a slick long and wide was reported. Force 4 conditions, together with dispersant sprayed from a supply vessel, helped disperse it.

Only two downhole safety valves failed to close, and five oil wells were left burning. The fires were eventually extinguished by a team onboard &quot;Tharos&quot; led by firefighter Red Adair, who had been asked to intervene by Occidental chairman Armand Hammer. A relief well was started on 14 July. The wells were capped by 22 July by fitting new valves on top, which allowed introduction of kill fluids.

The accommodation modules where the majority of those onboard had taken refuge were recovered from the seabed in late 1988. They were transported to Flotta, where they were searched by a team led by twenty officers of Grampian Police and including divers as well as Occidental, Department of Energy and Health and Safety Executive personnel. The bodies of 87 men were found inside. The remains of the platform were toppled into the sea on 28 March 1989.

The total insured loss of the disaster was about £1.7 billion (£ billion in ), making it one of the costliest man-made catastrophes ever. The event had a considerable impact on North Sea oil and gas production. Piper, Tartan, and Claymore were not the only fields impacted, with Scapa, Highlander and Petronella also having to wait up to 13 months before half production was regained. The total deferred production amounted to of oil.

===Inquiry and safety recommendations===

The Piper Alpha Public Inquiry was set up in November 1988 to establish the cause of the disaster. It was chaired by the Scottish judge William Cullen. A variety of sources of evidence were used, including eyewitness accounts from survivors and crews of nearby vessels, data from nearby platforms, the recovery of the deceased, debris collected from the seabed, documentation available ashore, and accounts from &#x27;back-to-back&#x27; personnel who had recently worked on Piper Alpha. Highly unusual for an inquiry of this scope was the fact that the entire scene of the accident had effectively disappeared into the sea. The inquiry decided against the recovery of the process modules from the seabed, due to the time required, the hazards involved, and the low chance that that evidence could actually prove useful for the investigation. The living quarters had, however, been recovered, and this allowed for the collection of key documents to support the investigation.

After 180 days of proceedings extending for 13 months, the report &quot;Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster&quot; (short: &quot;Cullen Report&quot;) was issued in November 1990. It concluded that the initial condensate leak was the result of maintenance work being carried out simultaneously on a pump and related safety valve. The inquiry was critical of Piper Alpha&#x27;s operator, Occidental, which was found guilty of having inadequate maintenance and safety procedures, but no criminal charges were ever brought against the company.

The second part of the report made 106 recommendations for changes to North Sea safety procedures:
*Thirty-seven recommendations covered procedures for operating equipment, 32 the information of platform personnel, 25 the design of platforms and 12 the information of emergency services.
*The responsibility to implement was for 57 with the regulator, 40 for the operators, 8 for the industry as a whole and 1 for stand-by ship owners.

The recommendations led to the enactment of the Offshore Safety Act 1992 and the making of the Offshore Installations (Safety Case) Regulations 1992.

Most significant of these recommendations was that operators were required to present a safety case and that the responsibility for enforcing safety in exploitation operations in the part of the North Sea apportioned to the UK should be moved from the Department of Energy to the Health and Safety Executive, as having both production and safety overseen by the same agency was a conflict of interest.

=== Civil suit ===
Occidental and their insurers, Lloyd&#x27;s of London, paid survivors and families of the dead a total of $220 million in settlements. Later, Lloyd&#x27;s and Elf Enterprise Caledonia Ltd, successors to Occidental Petroleum, brought civil proceedings against a number of contractor companies who were working on Piper at the time of the accident. Based on the argument that the responsibility for the accident should be shared among the platform operator and the contractors working onboard immediately prior to the accident, Elf was seeking to recover from the defendants a part of the monies paid to the injured and the affected families. Among the companies involved were British Telecommunications, Wood Group, and Stena Offshore.

Giving verdict in what was then the longest civil trial in Scottish history, in 1997 Lord Caplan ruled that two workers who were killed in the explosion, Robert Vernon (who had posthumously received the Queen&#x27;s Commendation for Bravery) and Terence Sutton, were to blame for the accident. Lord Caplan found that Sutton had failed to tighten the bolts of the blind flange at the suction side of the removed PSV, and that Vernon had put the pump back in operation without checking its status first. Vernon was employed by Occidental and Sutton by contractor Score (UK) Ltd. The finding against Vernon and Sutton was controversial among the families of the victims.

===Insurance claims===

The disaster led to insurance claims of around US$1.4 billion, making it at that time the largest insured man-made catastrophe. The insurance and reinsurance claims process revealed serious weaknesses in the way insurers at Lloyd&#x27;s of London and elsewhere kept track of their potential exposures and led to their procedures being reformed.

One of the 1997 rulings by Lord Caplan was that, albeit in principle contractors were obliged to indemnify Elf, Elf&#x27;s insurers could not claim back monies from the defendant contractors, because Elf had already largely been indemnified by Lloyd&#x27;s. Elf and Lloyd&#x27;s appealed this finding in Scotland to the Inner House of the Court of Session, which decided in their favour in December 1999. Subsequently, the contractors appealed the decision to the House of Lords in London in November 2001, but their appeal was rejected. As a result, Elf and their insurers were able to recoup £136 million with accrued interest.

==Legacy==

The accident is the world&#x27;s worst offshore oil and gas disaster in terms of lives lost. Only the 2010 &quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot; tragedy has caused a comparable impact in the industry.

Survivors and relatives of those who died went on to form the Piper Alpha Families and Survivors&#x27; Association, which campaigns on North Sea safety issues. A lasting effect of the Piper Alpha disaster was the establishment of the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee, the trade union for oil and gas rig workers. The union, while still in the form of an unofficial committee drawn from different North Sea rigs, organized large strikes in the summers of 1989 and 1990.

Piper Bravo was installed in 1992 to replace Alpha and commenced production in February 1993. A wreck buoy marking Alpha&#x27;s remains was installed and lies approximately from Bravo.

Beginning in 1998, one month after the 10th anniversary, professor David Alexander, director of the Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research at Robert Gordon University carried out a study into the long-term psychological and social effects of Piper Alpha. He managed to find 36 survivors who agreed to give interviews or complete questionnaires. Almost all of this group reported psychological problems. More than 70% of those interviewed reported psychological and behavioural symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Twenty-eight (or 78%) said they had difficulty in finding employment following the disaster; some offshore employers apparently regarded Piper Alpha survivors as &quot;Jonahs&quot; – bringers of bad luck, who would not be welcome on other rigs and platforms. The family members of the dead and surviving victims also reported various psychological and social problems. Alexander also stated, &quot;some of these lads are stronger than before Piper. They&#x27;ve learned things about themselves, changed their values, some relationships became stronger. People realised they have strengths they didn&#x27;t know they had. There was a lot of heroism took place.&quot;

In 2013, on the 25th anniversary of the tragedy, trade association Oil and Gas UK organized a three-day conference in Aberdeen to reflect on lessons learned from Piper Alpha and industry safety issues in general.

=== In process safety ===

The Piper Alpha disaster and the &quot;Cullen Report&quot; are milestones in the development of process safety. Its effects on the offshore oil and gas industry can be compared with those the Flixborough disaster had on the onshore chemical and petroleum process industry in the 1970s. The &quot;Cullen Report&quot; put a strong emphasis on the importance of a robust safety management system (SMS). The requirement for a safety management system to be in place was introduced in British legislation in the wake of Piper Alpha. Elements of process safety management that failed on Piper Alpha included:

* Permit-to-work, and in particular the mechanism of permit handover. The whole accident chain of events commenced due to the attempt to start-up a pump which was actually under maintenance.
* Company audits, which did not pick up on the systemic failings of the permit-to-work system. The &quot;Cullen Report&quot; included a recommendation to shift the regulatory regime to a greater focus on SMS audit rather than on inspection.
* Contractor management. It had been the first day on the platform for the production operator, who was a contractor and was left on his own without any operating procedures.
* Management of change. The platform, originally thought for oil production only, was retrofitted to handle gas. The change was not properly thought out and assessed, as the placement of critical gas facilities next to the unprotected control room stood to demonstrate. 
* Asset integrity, by way of inspection and maintenance. Safety-critical systems such as liferafts, fire pumps, or emergency lighting do not seem to have received proper attention.

In general, Piper Alpha marked a watershed moment in that it ushered in a greater focus on process safety management and on a risk-based, rather than purely prescriptive, hazard management. As a result of the tragedy, the Safety Case Regulations came into force in 1992. By late 1993, a safety case had to be submitted to the Health and Safety Executive for every platform and rig in British waters (including the exclusive economic zone). The safety case must describe and justify the design, inherent hazards and residual risk in the spirit of the ALARP (as low as reasonably practicable) principle, as well as the means of managing such residual risk. The safety case must be maintained up to date through the lifecycle of the installation.

The safety case regime has been ascribed a measure of success in promoting safer facility design and management of offshore operations in the United Kingdom. Trade association Oil and Gas UK linked a significant fall in lost time injury frequency rate observed since 1997 to the introduction of the regime. The decrease in the number of accidental hydrocarbon release events in the British offshore oil and gas industry has also been correlated to the new regulatory approach. A study commissioned by the Health and Safety executive found that the regime heightened awareness of risks throughout the industry and set in motion a more structured decision-making process targeting risk reduction efforts, safety management system improvements, and a better safety culture. According to another source, Piper was the catalyst for a development from an unsystematic, albeit well-meaning, collection of standards and processes to a systematized approach specific to safety.

However, some criticism of the safety case approach has also been voiced, pointing to implementation and communication problems as well as issues with the supporting safety studies. The industry&#x27;s cost-cutting initiatives as well as the handling of workers&#x27; involvement in the development of safety cases have also been identified as potential factors of degradation of the safety case regime.

The safety case regime has been adopted outside the United Kingdom, both as a regulatory instrument (for example in Australia, Malaysia, and Norway, among others) and as a voluntary initiative taken by several oil companies. In the United States, the American Petroleum Institute&#x27;s Recommended Practice 75 for &quot;Development of a Safety and Environmental Management Program for Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Operations and Facilities&quot; was issued, at least in part, in response to the tragedy.

In terms of facility design, some of the &quot;Cullen Report&quot;&#x27;s recommendations have become tenets for the safe design of offshore oil and gas installations:

* Systematic identification and assessment of fire and explosion hazards.
* Analysis of and protection against smoke and gas ingress as well as survivability against fire and explosion of a temporary refuge (usually within, and potentially extending to the entirety of, the living quarters), where the crew could muster and wait out the accident, while arrangements for emergency management and/or facility evacuation are put in place.
* Analysis of escape routes and means of evacuation, with due regards to their survivability, accessibility and redundancy.
* Analysis of the survivability of safety-critical systems required for emergency management, such as emergency shutdown valves (in particular those along hydrocarbon risers), primary structural elements, hydrocarbon piping and vessels, fire pumps, firewater distribution and deluge, control and radio rooms, public announcement and general alarm system, emergency sources of power, emergency lighting, all of which failed on Piper, additionally to the aforementioned impairments of escape routes and safe muster area.

These analyses, which are called &quot;forthwith studies&quot; by the &quot;Cullen Report,&quot; are now standard engineering deliverables in the design of offshore oil and gas facilities. Quantified risk assessment (QRA) also became more common, particularly in support to ALARP arguments. One effect of these studies was that a rectangular (rather than square) layout became common for new North Sea platforms, to allow for increased spacing between vulnerable areas and major hazard modules. For the same reason, bridge-linked platforms became more common to increase separation from the accommodation module. Other lessons learnt in design were the importance of blast walls in protecting safety-critical systems; the need to minimize congestion and promote natural ventilation in process areas, to decrease the chance of explosions; the need to ensure that the temporary refuge HVAC system be capable to repel smoke and gas ingress by positive pressurization and implementation of gas-tight dampers automatically actuated from smoke and gas detectors; redundancy of critical communication systems, like radio and public address; remote start of fire pumps; need to optimize the location and fireproofing of riser emergency shutdown valves; assessment for the need of subsea pipeline isolation valves, to segregate the amount of hydrocarbon available for fire escalation in case of riser or riser valve failure. The resulting changes in the design philosophy of offshore facilities have therefore been towards an inherently safer design (ISD) concept.

In the same spirit, companies also sought to decrease the number of operators needed to run offshore facilities, in an attempt to reduce human exposure to major accidents. The first totally unoccupied (normally unmanned) installation, in the Amethyst gas field, was commissioned in September 1990. There is debate as to whether unmanned facilities are actually beneficial in terms of decreasing risk to the workers, given the requirements to transfer personnel to and from the platform (for inspection and maintenance activities), which in itself carries an amount of risk associated to helicopter flights, boating, and boat-to-platform personnel transfer.

=== Memorials ===

A condolence banner was gifted in 1989 by the Victorian Trades Hall Council of Australia, and is now in the Aberdeen Maritime Museum.

On 6 July 1991, the third anniversary of the disaster, a memorial sculpture was unveiled by the Queen Mother in the Rose Garden within Hazlehead Park in Aberdeen. In it are three figures of oil workers, one facing west and representing the physical nature of offshore activities, one facing east and representing eternal movement and youth and the central one, facing north and whose left hand holds a pool of oil sculpted in the shape of an unwinding spiral. It was created by Sue Jane Taylor, a Scottish sculptor who based much of her work around what she saw in and around the oil industry and had actually visited Piper Alpha in 1987. One of the survivors was used as a model for one of the figures. Also in 1991, Scottish composer James MacMillan wrote &quot;Tuireadh&quot;, a piece for clarinet and string quartet, as a musical complement to the memorial sculpture.

A memorial stone was erected in 1992 in Strathclyde Country Park to commemorate the men lost from that region.

The &quot;Piper Alpha Window&quot; was created in 1994 by congregation member Jennifer Jane Bayliss for Ferryhill Church in Aberdeen.

The Oil Chapel in the Kirk of St Nicholas, Aberdeen was dedicated in 1990 to mark 25 years of North Sea oil. The chapel hosts a book of remembrance to all those who have died offshore in British waters.

=== In the media ===
The incident was featured in the 1990 STV documentary television series &quot;Rescue&quot;, about the RAF Search and Rescue Force at RAF Lossiemouth, in the episode &quot;Piper Alpha&quot;. Coincidentally, the film crew had been documenting the rescue teams at Lossiemouth at the time of accident and were able to accompany the helicopter during the Piper Alpha disaster, filming events as they happened from helicopter &quot;Rescue 138&quot;.

The disaster was featured in the first episode of the BBC television series &quot;Disaster&quot;, aired in January 1997.

In 1998, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary, Prospero Productions of Australia released the documentary &quot;Paying for the Piper&quot;. It was written and produced by Ed Punchard, who was one of the divers that managed to escape the inferno. The film follows Punchard&#x27;s return to Scotland to confront his past and culminates in a meeting with Occidental officers.

In 2004, &quot;National Geographic&quot; featured this incident in its &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; documentary as the episode &quot;Explosion in the North Sea&quot;.

On 6 July 2008, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 90-minute play by Stephen Phelps entitled &quot;Piper Alpha&quot;. Based on the actual evidence given to the Cullen Inquiry, the events of that night were retold 20 years to the minute after they happened.

Also in 2008, to mark the 20th anniversary of the disaster, a stage play, &quot;Lest We Forget&quot; was commissioned by Aberdeen Performing Arts and written by playwright Mike Gibb. It was performed in Aberdeen in the week leading up to the anniversary with the final performance on 6 July 2008, the 20th anniversary.

In 2011, Lee Hutcheon produced and directed &quot;The Men of Piper Alpha&quot;, a documentary with several interviews to the survivors.

In 2013, on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the video &quot;Remembering Piper: The Night That Changed Our World&quot; was released by British offshore oil and gas industry initiative Step Change in Safety. It incorporates passages from the BBC radio play and artwork by Sue Jane Taylor.

The documentary film &quot;Fire in the Night&quot; was also released in 2013. It was made by Berriff McGinty Films and co-produced by STV. Producer and cameraman Paul Berriff had been with Sea King &quot;Rescue 138&quot; during the filming of the &quot;Rescue&quot; series.

In 2017 the episode &quot;Oil Rig Explosion&quot; of the Smithsonian Channel documentary series &quot;Make It Out Alive!&quot; focused on the disaster, with interviews to, among others, Geoff Bollands, Iain Letham, Charles Haffey, and Paul Berriff.

In 2018, a special edition of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; board game was released to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the tragedy. It was sponsored by a number of companies working in the North Sea offshore oil and gas industry, including majors such as Shell, whose Brent platforms substituted for the four train station squares. The game release was part of a fundraiser for the maintenance costs of the memorial in Hazlehead Park. The box lid prominently featured Piper Alpha imagery and a &quot;Piper Alpha 30th Anniversary&quot; title, which led the game to be referred to as the &quot;Piper Alpha &quot;Monopoly&quot;&quot;. The reactions of some of the survivors and victims&#x27; families were negative, calling the game &quot;callous&quot; and a &quot;sick joke&quot;. The game was re-released with a different design to clarify that it was really an oil-and-gas (and not a Piper Alpha-themed) &quot;Monopoly&quot; edition.

Also in 2018, the disaster was featured on the History documentary series &quot;James Nesbitt&#x27;s Disasters That Changed Britain&quot;. Testimonials were heard from survivors and relatives of victims.

In 2023, to mark the 35th anniversary, writer Mike Gibb adapted his stage play as a novel titled &quot;I Had Never Heard a City Cry Before&quot;, a quote from the script.

* The pioneer period, up to and particularly including the days of the Oregon Trail;
* The period of Indian Wars and mining claims inspired by the California Gold Rush and later facilitated by the Mining Act of 1872;
* The period of homesteading between 1875 and 1925, which affected nine million acres (36,000 km²); and
* The modern period of neologisms

The seventh edition contains 6,252 entries, with references to another 2,679 names scattered throughout the text. Entries are listed in alphabetical order, beginning with &quot;A B Crossing&quot;, a railroad station in Coos County, and ending with &quot;Zwagg Island&quot;, an island near Brookings, Oregon.

South Savo was the main part of the old Mikkeli Province, established in 1831. Some municipalities were transferred from the county to Central Finland Province, which was established in 1960.

In 2002, Kangaslampi moved from the province of South Savo to the province of North Savo. Suomenniemi became part of Etelä-Savo in 2013 when it merged with Ristiina to form the city of Mikkeli. At the beginning of 2021, Joroinen moved to the province of North Savo and Heinävesi to the province of North Karelia as a result of provincial and social and health care reforms.

<doc id="612775" wikidata="Q5692" url="?curid=612775" title="South Ostrobothnia">
<text>South Ostrobothnia ( ; ) is one of the 19 regions of Finland. It borders the regions of Ostrobothnia, Central Ostrobothnia, Central Finland, Pirkanmaa, and Satakunta. Among the Finnish regions, South Ostrobothnia is the ninth largest in terms of population. Seinäjoki is the regional centre and by far the largest city in the area.

As a cultural area, South Ostrobothnia is larger than its current regional borders and includes the region of Ostrobothnia as well.

==Geography==

The natural landscape of South Ostrobothnia is mainly expanses, which is Finland&#x27;s largest plain area. South Ostrobothnia is connected to the coastal region of the Gulf of Bothnia in the west, to the river country of Central Ostrobothnia in the north, and to Suomenselkä in the east and south, which is the watershed between the regions of Ostrobothnia and Finnish Lakeland. The land surface rises gently from the coast inland, and the 100-meter height level is reached about 100 kilometers from the coast.

The river valleys of South Ostrobothnia have traditionally been flood-prone areas.

== History ==

South Ostrobothnia had its first permanent settlements during the Iron Age. Swedish control began in the 12th century, leaving a lasting impact on the region&#x27;s cultural identity. Swedish remains a spoken language alongside Finnish. In 1809, Finland, including South Ostrobothnia, became part of the Russian Empire as the Grand Duchy of Finland. The region endured hardships during the tumultuous 19th century, including the Crimean War (1853–1856) and the throes of industrialization. The early 19th century also saw the rise of religious revival movements like Pietism, shaping the region&#x27;s social fabric. Finland gained independence in 1917, and South Ostrobothnia played a role in the nation-building process. The 20th century witnessed significant industrial development, with metalworking, machinery, and electronics becoming major contributors to the economy. Despite the devastation of the Winter War (1939–1945) against the Soviet Union, the region persevered. Since the mid-20th century, the economy has diversified, with the service sector playing an increasingly important role.

== Historical provinces ==
== Culture ==

Regional and historical sub-tribal identity is generally stronger in South Ostrobothnia than in most regions of Finland.

The South Ostrobothnian dialect belongs to the western Finnish dialects. However, in the most eastern part of the region people speak a Savonian dialect that has Ostrobothnian elements.

One of the biggest rock festivals in Finland, Provinssirock, and the world&#x27;s oldest tango festival Tangomarkkinat are both held in Seinäjoki. The folk music festival Eteläpohjalaiset Spelit is held annually in different South Ostrobothnian locations and the opera and music festival Ilmajoen Musiikkijuhlat is held in Ilmajoki. Many of the cultural events in South Ostrobothnia are rooted in local folk festivals and communal work.

There are several local folk costumes. Jussipaita is a traditional sweater that has become a symbol for South Ostrobothnian identity.
Notable architecture in South Ostrobothnia include the Lakeuden Risti Church and other buildings in the Aalto Centre in Seinäjoki designed by the South Ostrobothnian-born architect Alvar Aalto. A traditional peasant house, ”pohjalaistalo” (Ostrobothnian house), is a part of the local folk culture.

South Ostrobothnia is known for its agriculture and animal husbandry. Traditional local cuisine include &quot;leipäjuusto&quot; and &quot;kropsu&quot;, an Ostrobothnian pancake.

<text>Kanta-Häme (; ), sometimes referred to by the obsolete Tavastia Proper or as the Häme region, is a region ( / ) of Finland. It borders the regions of Southwest Finland, Pirkanmaa, Päijät-Häme, and Uusimaa.

Hämeenlinna is the largest urban area in the region. There are two other municipalities that have township status: Riihimäki and Forssa.

==Historical provinces==
The Kanta-Hame region has been inhabited since the Stone Age. The first written mention of the historical province of Tavastia is found in the Chronicle of Novgorod, in reference to a military campaign launched by Prince Vladimir in 1042.  The region had been ruled by the Swedes since the late 13th century, when Birger Jarl led the Second Crusade against the inhabitants of the historical province of Tavastia. In the 14th century, Häme became a fiefdom with Häme Castle as its administrative seat. When Finland was taken from Sweden by the Russians in 1809, Tavastia itself became part of the Russian Empire. Russian rule ended in 1917.

==Heraldry==

Kanta-Häme uses the arms of the old historical province Tavastia.

== Geography ==

The landscape of Kanta-Häme has many of the characteristics of Finnish Lakeland. The province belongs almost entirely to the Kokemäenjoki water basin. The largest lake is Lake Vanajavesi, which receives water from Lammi, Hausjärvi, Loppi and Janakkala from the southeast. The north-eastern part of the province belongs to the so-called Hauho route, whose waters flow into Vanajavesi through Pälkäne and Valkeakoski. In addition to Lake Vanajavesi, the largest lakes in this region are Lake Kuohijärvi, Lake Pyhäjärvi, Lake Iso Roinevesi, Lake Hauhonselkä, Lake Ilmoilanselkä and Lake Lehijärvi in Hattula. In the southwestern part of the province, Lake Loimijoki rises in the Tammela and Forssa areas and flows through Loima and Huittisten into Kokemäenjoki. The largest lake in the southwestern part of Häme is Lake Pyhäjärvi in Tammela, where the Loimijoki originates. In Riihimäki and the southern part of Lope, the headwaters of River Vantaanjoki flow south into the Gulf of Finland.

Torronsuo and Liesjärvi National Parks are located in Kanta-Häme, both in the southwest of the province in Tammela.

== Culture ==
Kanta-Häme region is well known for the preserved tradition of brewing sahti.

==Municipalities==

The region of Kanta-Häme consists of 11 municipalities, three of which have city status (marked in bold).

<doc id="612781" wikidata="Q2629842" url="?curid=612781" title="Jew Watch">
<text>Jew Watch was an antisemitic website promoting Holocaust denial and negative claims about Jews. The claims included allegations of a conspiracy that Jews control the media and banking, as well as accusations of Jewish involvement in terrorist groups. The site contained propaganda, according to Sam Varghese of &quot;The Age&quot;, similar to that used in Nazi Germany. It was widely considered a hate site. Jew Watch received support from Stormfront, a white nationalist and neo-Nazi site. The site described itself as a &quot;not-for-profit library for private study, scholarship, or research [that keeps] a close watch on Jewish Communities and organizations worldwide&quot;.

The site received media attention in April 2004 when it emerged as the first result in a Google search for the word &quot;Jew&quot; and a petition was started to get the site removed from Google search results. A scandal in 2006 involved solicitations for donations to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina being redirected to Jew Watch.

==Ownership==
Established in 1998, the website was owned and maintained by Frank Weltner, a member of the National Alliance, a white nationalist and white separatist organization.

==Themes==
Jew Watch featured articles, videos, and links, organized in the form of a Web directory. Content was organized under topic headings such as &quot;Jewish Controlled Press&quot;, &quot;Jewish Banking &amp; Financial Manipulations&quot;, &quot;Jewish Communist Rulers &amp; Killers&quot;, and &quot;Zionist Occupied Governments – Z.O.G.&quot;

Jew Watch claimed that Jews control the world&#x27;s financial systems and media. It also claimed that the &quot;All Anti-Christian Jewish Red Commissars&quot; killed 100 million Christians in Russia from 1917 to 1945 under the orders of &quot;Trotsky, the Jewish Commissar of Commissars&quot;. It said that global Jewry is the driving force behind both global capitalism and communism. The site linked to others which speculate that Jews have committed or are planning genocide against the Palestinian people; the site also promoted Holocaust denial, maintaining that the Holocaust either never happened or was greatly exaggerated.

==Controversy==

===Google Search results===
Many news sources, weblogs, and general information sites linked to Jew Watch creating a Google bomb that led to the site being the first search result for the term &quot;Jew.&quot; In May 2004, Steven Weinstock launched an online petition on RemoveJewWatch.com to remove Jew Watch from Google. By mid-2004 the site had collected over 125,000 signatures.

In response to complaints, including one from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Google added an explanation to searches for the site. They said their results are automatically ranked by computer algorithms, and that they do not approve of any of the results.

In December 2004, OSCE&#x27;s Sandy Starr addressed the issues of freedom of speech:
When it transpired that the anti-Semitic website Jew Watch ranked highest in the search engine Google&#x27;s results for the search term &quot;Jew&quot;, a Remove Jew Watch campaign was established, to demand that Google remove the offending website from its listings. Fortunately for the principle of free speech, Google did not capitulate to this particular demand ... Forced to act on its own initiative, Remove Jew Watch successfully used Googlebombing ... Better still would have been either a proper contest of ideas between Jew Watch and Remove Jew Watch, or alternatively a decision that Jew Watch was beneath contempt and should simply be ignored. Not every crank and extremist warrants attention, even if they do occasionally manage to spoof search engine rankings.

In 2013, Jew Watch was still appearing on the first pages of Google Search results for the term &quot;Jew.&quot;

===Hurricane Katrina solicitations===
St. Louis City Circuit Judge Julian L. Bush permanently barred Frank Weltner and his site InternetDonation.org from soliciting funds in Missouri for charitable purposes after it was revealed by State Attorney General Jay Nixon that Frank Weltner had set up multiple websites soliciting funds for victims of Hurricane Katrina and then redirected those wishing to donate to his site that collected money for Jew Watch. A press release from the Attorney General said:

Anyone who takes advantage of the generosity and compassion of his fellow citizens in an attempt to fund his hate-filled Web site should never again be in the position to solicit charitable funds from well-meaning Missourians.

<text>The Open Source Applications Foundation (OSAF) was a non-profit organization that was established in 2001 with the goal of developing Open-source software applications and tools. The organization&#x27;s most notable project was Chandler, a Personal information management software and collaborative productivity suite.

==History==
OSAF was founded in 2001 by software pioneer Mitch Kapor in an effort to rearrange the dynamics of the software community. In an interview with CNET a few years after the foundation was established, Kapur described the allure of open-source software: &quot;I think that for people who use software, in the long run, open-source products are going to be less expensive and of higher quality. Also, open-source products put more control into the hands of people and organizations that use the software, which is a good thing.&quot;

Funding for OSAF was primarily provided by Kapor himself, although the foundation did also receive sizable grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the Common Solutions Group to develop the much-anticipated Chandler project.

In January 2008, Kapor ended his involvement with the foundation, stepped down from the board, and provided transitional funding. In the restructure that followed, Katie Capps Parlante became acting president. There were at one time eleven employees with Sheila Mooney as president.

== OSAF Mission ==
The OSAF was guided by a list of 7 principles that would make up the organization&#x27;s mission:

# Create and gain wide adoption of open source application software of uncompromising quality.
# Carry forward the vision of Vannevar Bush, Doug Engelbart, and Ted Nelson of the computer as a medium for communication, collaboration, and coordination.
# Design a new application to manage personal information including notes, mail, tasks, appointments and events, contacts, documents and other personal resources.
# Enable sharing with colleagues, friends and family. In particular, meet the unique and under-served needs of small group collaboration.
# Demonstrate that open source software *can* serve a general audience in the consumer market.
# Offer a choice of platforms and full interoperability amongst Microsoft Windows, MacOS, and Linux versions.
# Leverage our resources by using an open source model of development.

== Chandler Project ==
Chandler was envisioned as a revolutionary PIM application that aimed to integrate email, calendars, tasks, and notes into a seamless and intuitive interface. The project garnered significant attention and high expectations from the open-source community and software enthusiasts. The goal was to create a powerful productivity tool that would provide a new – and much cheaper – way of managing personal information and organizing collaborative work.

The development of Chandler faced numerous challenges, including technical complexities, feature creep, and management issues. The project&#x27;s ambitious goals and the complexity of implementing them led to delays and a protracted development cycle. Despite the efforts of the OSAF team and the enthusiasm of the community, Chandler failed to deliver a stable and fully-featured product.

The 2007 book &quot;Dreaming in Code: Two Dozen Programmers, Three Years, 4,732 Bugs, and One Quest for Transcendent Software&quot; documented the struggles of OSAF in building an open-source calendar application, Chandler.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Latvia on 5 October 2002. The New Era Party emerged as the largest party in the Saeima, winning 26 of the 100 seats.

==Results==

==Aftermath==
Voters severely punished the previous governing parties, with the People&#x27;s Party and For Fatherland and Freedom both losing seats, while Latvian Way lost all its MPs.

A new coalition government was formed by the New Era Party, Latvia&#x27;s First Party, For Fatherland and Freedom and the Union of Greens and Farmers. This enjoyed a parliamentary majority of 55 of the 100 MPs. However, after two years For Fatherland and Freedom left the coalition and was replaced by the People&#x27;s Party, who returned to government after a two-year absence.

<text>Pagat.com is a website containing rules to hundreds of card games from all over the world. Maintained by John McLeod, it contains information for traditional, commercial, and newly invented card games from all over the world. It has been described by writer David Parlett as the most important site of its kind on the Internet and the &quot;only authoritative web site for all rules of card games and associated material.&quot;

The site does not provide official rules to &quot;folk games&quot; as none generally exist, but rather reports how the games are actually played. As a consequence, the game articles provide many variants for the described games. The site relies on volunteer contributors from all over the world, and the game articles provide information on where the games are played as described and who has contributed the rules. The site also describes games that are played with domino-style tiles, which, although similar in spirit, are not strictly speaking card games. In addition, the site contains many pages related to card games in general, including a page on the general mechanics of card games.

The word &quot;Pagat&quot; in the website&#x27;s name is derived from the term given to the lowest ranking trump in Tarock card games such as Königrufen.

David Parlett&#x27;s book &quot;Teach Yourself Card Games&quot; recommends the site as the first and probably the only place one needs to seek for rules of card games, and his &quot;A-Z of Card Games&quot; refers to entries in pagat.com for the rules of those games that are only mentioned in the book.

While the website provides rules for an immense number of card games, some card games can be found on wikipedia that are not listed at pagat.com; it also has links to external game rule sites.

<text>Ivan Noble (June 1967 – 31 January 2005) was a British journalist who worked for BBC News Online, and became well known for his diary documenting his fight against cancer.

Born in Leeds, he lived in East Germany working as a translator between 1988 and 1990. He then joined the BBC, originally working for them as a translator, then as a sub-editor in Nairobi. He later worked in the Science and Technology section of the BBC News website, where he was known for his love of complicated gadgetry.

He was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme on 29 August 2002, and wrote about his battle against the cancer on the BBC News website in a series entitled &quot;Tumour Diary&quot;. Noble continued to write stories for the series until 30 January 2005, the day before he died. The tumor left him with serious visual impairments on the right side. In December 2004, having completed several courses of chemotherapy, and after a brief remission, his tumor started to grow again. Noble enjoyed a huge amount of public support during this period.

His final comment before his death ended with the statement &quot;I will end with a plea. I still have no idea why I ended up with a cancer, but plenty of other cancer patients know what made them ill...If two or three people stop smoking as a result of anything I have ever written then the one of them who would have got cancer will live and all my scribblings will have been worthwhile.&quot;

Noble died in a London hospice aged 37. He was survived by his wife, Almut, and two children (a son and daughter).

==Legacy==
A book entitled &quot;Like a Hole in the Head&quot; (), which chronicles Noble&#x27;s fight with cancer, was released in May 2005. A bursary was established by the BBC in Noble&#x27;s memory; it will provide annual funding for a newly qualified journalist to work at the science and technology desk of the BBC News website for six months. The first recipient of this bursary was Rebecca Morelle.

<doc id="612803" wikidata="Q1277329" url="?curid=612803" title="Survival of the Dead">
<text>Survival of the Dead is a 2009 horror film written and directed by George A. Romero and starring Alan van Sprang, Kenneth Welsh and Kathleen Munroe. It is the sixth entry in Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series. The story follows a group of AWOL National Guardsmen who briefly appeared in &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot;.

It was the last film directed by Romero before his death in 2017.

==Plot==
The prologue follows the actions of National Guard Sergeant &quot;Nicotine&quot; Crockett, who, along with Kenny, Francisco and Tomboy, desert their posts and rob the protagonists of the previous film. Meanwhile, off the coast of Delaware lies Plum Island, home to two feuding Irish families: the O&#x27;Flynns and the Muldoons. The former family, led by Patrick O&#x27;Flynn, round up a posse to kill the undead on the island. O&#x27;Flynn learns that the Muldoons are keeping their undead loved ones safe until a cure is found. Tensions come to a head when O&#x27;Flynn and his posse arrive at the Muldoon house to dispatch their undead children, only to engage in a brief gunfight that leaves a woman dead as well. Unable to put the children down himself, Patrick surrenders his weapons when the Muldoon posse arrives. Seamus Muldoon contemplates killing Patrick until Patrick&#x27;s daughter Janet suggests he be exiled from the island instead.

Boy joins the National Guardsmen and through him they learn of Plum Island. They watch a video made by Patrick and follow the instructions in it that leads them to a nearby dock. At the dock, O&#x27;Flynn and his men attempt to rob the Guardsmen, which results in a shootout. Francisco steals a ferry boat and bites off the finger of an attacking zombie in the process. All of the O&#x27;Flynns but Patrick are killed by zombies, and he boards the ferry. During the trip to the island, Patrick says that he sent other people to Plum Island to anger the Muldoons.

When the group reach the island they discover that the Muldoons have chained up their zombies in imitations of their previous lives. They also see that the people sent to the island by Patrick have been killed. Patrick sees his daughter Janet ride by on a horse, apparently dead and turned into a zombie. Patrick attempts to gather allies when two Muldoons attack them, shooting Crockett and Kenny. The latter dies from his wounds, and is shot in the head by Patrick to prevent reanimation. Francisco realizes that he infected himself when he bit off the zombie&#x27;s finger, and asks Tomboy to shoot him to keep him from turning. Tomboy shoots him and is then captured by Muldoon.

Patrick finds out that the daughter he saw earlier was actually Janet&#x27;s twin sister Jane. Janet, still alive, joins Patrick and the Guardsmen in their attack on the Muldoons. A standoff occurs at the bridge that separates the two families&#x27; land, and the O&#x27;Flynn group is captured; Boy and Janet escape. Muldoon reveals his attempts to persuade the zombies to eat something other than human flesh, and uses Jane as a test case. He tries to persuade the dead woman to bite her horse, but instead she attacks and bites her sister Janet. A melee ensues and captured zombies are released, consuming people from both sides. Muldoon and O&#x27;Flynn call a truce that is almost immediately broken when Muldoon shoots O&#x27;Flynn, who pulls a hidden gun and kills Muldoon.

Crockett and his group attempt to leave the island. Janet witnesses her sister bite the horse and rushes to tell Crockett&#x27;s group the news, but before doing so she is shot in the head by Patrick, who wanted to prevent his daughter turning before succumbing to his own wounds. Crockett, Boy, and Tomboy board the ferry and escape the island while the zombies are eating the horse. Crockett muses about the purpose of war as the reanimated O&#x27;Flynn and Muldoon stagger toward each other, guns unloaded, and attempt to shoot and kill each other again.

==Cast==

Actors Shawn Roberts, Scott Wentworth, Amy Lalonde, Michelle Morgan, and Joshua Close from &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot; appear in archival footage early in the film.

==Production==
===Development===
The film was inspired by the 1958 William Wyler Western film &quot;The Big Country&quot;. Romero would use the film&#x27;s concept on his sixth zombie film as a message on war and conflict, as stated by himself after being questioned about the film: &quot;No… the idea was to make a film about war or entities that don’t die, conflicts, disagreements that people can’t resolve, whether its Ireland, or the Middle East, or the Senate… that was the idea. And then I decided that was the best way to depict it. And then I had this other idea about an island would be a logical place for people to go, an idea I sort of played with in some of the other films. So I said OK, the best way to tell this story I think is to have a protagonist go to the island only to find out that it’s in the middle of basically a war that won’t die, between these two old guys. And the moment that came together I remembered The Big Country. And I’m always looking for something different sort of stylistically with these films so that they’re not the same which makes it more interesting for us as filmmakers. All the people on the set, production design, DP, good friends of mine, we sort of work as a big family. So we all sat down and I made everyone watch the big country. And then my thought was “Hey why don’t we go full on with this, go widescreen, not mute the colors, really try to make it look like William Wyler”. So that was something we did as a fun exercise to give it a different taste&quot;.

===Filming===
The film was independently produced, and distributed by Artfire Pictures. It had a budget of four million USD. Romero shot the film in Port Dover, Ontario and in Toronto, Ontario with an entirely Canadian cast and crew. Romero cited the tax incentives as a reason to shoot in Toronto.

==Release==
In September 2009, &quot;George A. Romero&#x27;s Survival of the Dead&quot; was screened at the Toronto International Film Festival, Venice Film Festival (where it screened for the festival&#x27;s top prize, the Golden Lion), Trinity of Terrors, Fantastic Fest in Austin, Texas, and Festival du Nouveau Cinéma in Montreal, introduced by George A. Romero. The film was released on DVD on March 15, 2010 in the United Kingdom.

In the U.S., it was released on April 30, 2010, for VOD and was aired for one night only on HDNET Movies on May 26, 2010. &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot; opened in 20 theaters on May 28, 2010 to an opening weekend gross of $43,757 and averaging $2,188 per theater. , the film has taken $101,740 and $41,451 internationally, bringing the total gross to $143,191. The film headlined the Texas Frightmare Weekend, which took place from April 28 through May 1, 2010. There was also a screening of &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot; at Madison Square Park, at a zombie walk on May 16, 2010. George A. Romero attended the event, as well as a screenincludingor the first 300 participants. The film was released on Blu-ray and DVD on August 24, 2010.

==Reception==
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 30% of 91 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review and the average rating is 4.85/10; the website&#x27;s consensus is: &quot;&quot;Survival of the Dead&quot; offers glimmers of Romero&#x27;s savage wit, but not nearly enough to make up for his unusually uninspired directing and a lack of new ideas.&quot; Metacritic rated it 43/100 based on 22 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Lesli Felperin of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;steeped in fan-pleasing gore but woefully thin on ideas, originality (beyond new zombie-offing methods) or directorial flair.&quot;

Ray Bennett of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called it &quot;a polished, fast-moving, entertaining picture&quot;.

Jeannette Catsoulis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Placidly photographed and lacking in urgency, &quot;Survival&quot; shows us the living flailing at fate and the dead just flailing.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; rated it 2/4 stars and wrote that very little in the film is new except for the deaths. Brad Miska of Bloody Disgusting rated it 1.5/5 stars and wrote that the film lacks a clear protagonist, antagonist, and theme.

On July 30, 2017, film critic Scout Tafoya of RogerEbert.com included &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot; in his video series &quot;The Unloved&quot;, where he highlights films which received mixed to negative reviews yet he believes to have artistic value. He stated that the film&#x27;s &quot;savage&quot; reception from critics could possibly be the reason for the absence of films made before Romero&#x27;s death, &quot;a tragedy because &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot;, a deeply weird but singularly Romero-esque Western, is one of the most searing chapters in the book on tribalism and the search for happiness he&#x27;d been writing with every film he made during his career... [Romero&#x27;s] most endearing quality may have been that he never ceased imagining that there could be a place for the poor and tired to finally find peace. To feel like their own masters, all they had to do was let go of the rituals and cruelties, but some still grip the old world like a life preserver.&quot;

==Legacy==
===&quot;Twilight of the Dead&quot; (TBA)===
In 2017, Romero would announce a new upcoming zombie film of his titled &quot;Twilight of the Dead&quot;. He penned a film treatment with co-writer Paolo Zelati depicting a conclusion to the series that explains the fate of the zombie protagonists from &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; and an ending where humanity has become virtually extinct. Romero had written the beginning of the script, but the project was stalled when Romero died of lung cancer later that year.

It was announced in April 2021 that the film had been put back into development under the supervision of Suzanne Romero, with Zelati finishing the script with screenwriters Joe Knetter and Robert L. Lucas. Suzanne told &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, &quot;This is the film he wanted to make. And while someone else will carry the torch as the director, it is very much a George A. Romero film.&quot; In August 2023, the film will start production in fall 2023.

<doc id="612804" wikidata="Q862011" url="?curid=612804" title="Bill Cartwright">
<text>James William Cartwright (born July 30, 1957) is an American former professional basketball player and a former coach . A 7&#x27;1&quot; (2.16 m) center, he played 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the New York Knicks, Chicago Bulls and Seattle SuperSonics, helping the Bulls capture consecutive championships in the 1991, 1992 and 1993 seasons. He attended Elk Grove High School in Elk Grove, California, and played college basketball at the University of San Francisco. Following his playing career, he served as the head coach of the Chicago Bulls, the Osaka Evessa of the bj League and the Mexico men&#x27;s national basketball team as well as an assistant coach for several years in the NBA.

==Early life==
James William Cartwright was born to James and Marie Cartwright on July 30, 1957, in Lodi, California.

In high school, Cartwright played basketball for the Elk Grove Thundering Herd under coach Dan Risley. With Cartwright on the squad, the team went undefeated in the 1973–1974 season and was named the best high school basketball team in California in both 1974 and 1975. In 1975, Elk Grove won the NorCal Tournament of Champions. In 1974 and 1975, Cartwright was named California High School State Basketball Player of the Year. In 1975, he was named California High School Sports Athlete of the Year.

As a prep star, Cartwright was just as highly regarded as fellow preps Darryl Dawkins and Bill Willoughby.

Cartwright graduated from Elk Grove High School in 1975.

==College basketball career==
Cartwright played college basketball at the University of San Francisco and was a consensus second-team all-American in 1977 and 1979. During his time at USF, Cartwright played on one of the tallest starting lineups in collegiate history. He graduated as the all-time leading scorer for the Dons, averaging 19.1 points and 10.2 rebounds per game. Cartwright led San Francisco to three trips to the NCAA tournament, to the first round in the 1977 and to the Sweet Sixteen in both 1978 and 1979.

==Professional career==

===New York Knicks (1979–1988)===
Cartwright was the third overall pick in the 1979 NBA draft selected by the New York Knicks, making his only career All-Star Game appearance in his first season. He averaged more than 20 points per game in his first two seasons for the Knicks, but after playing no fewer than 77 games in his first five seasons, a series of foot injuries caused him to miss the entire 1984–1985 season. Following that season, the Knicks drafted center Patrick Ewing with the number-one overall pick in the 1985 NBA draft. However, ongoing foot problems limited Cartwright to only two appearances during the 1985–1986 season. When Cartwright returned for the 1986–1987 season, he and Ewing would often start and play together but during the 1987–1988 season Cartwright was relegated to the bench.

===Chicago Bulls (1988–1994)===

On June 15, 1988, Cartwright was traded, along with two draft picks, to the Chicago Bulls for forward Charles Oakley and two draft picks. The Bulls were willing to part with Oakley, the league&#x27;s second-leading rebounder in the 1986–87 and 1987–88 seasons, because of their need for a center and the rapid development of power forward Horace Grant. Cartwright was the Bulls&#x27; starting center during their string of three consecutive NBA championships in 1991, 1992 and 1993. During the 1992–93 season, Cartwright took an elbow to the throat during a regular-season game against the Indiana Pacers that fractured his larynx and left him with a hoarse voice.

The Bulls, who were without Michael Jordan the following season following his retirement, made the 1994 NBA playoffs but were eliminated in a controversial game 7 in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Knicks. Cartwright departed the team thereafter as an unrestricted free agent.

===Seattle SuperSonics (1994–1995)===
Cartwright left the Bulls as a free agent and signed with the Seattle SuperSonics. He only played in 29 games for the Sonics, and retired after the 1994–95 NBA season.

==Coaching career==
A year after his retirement, Cartwright joined the Bulls once again as an assistant coach under Phil Jackson ahead of the 1996–97 NBA season. He was a member of the championship-winning teams in 1997 and 1998. The Bulls went through significant changes following the 1997–98 season, with not only Jordan and Pippen leaving, but Tim Floyd taking over as head coach from Jackson. The Bulls had a lengthy rebuilding effort, and Cartwright took over the Bulls 27 games into the 2001–02 season, going 17–38 after the team&#x27;s 4–23 start under Floyd and interim head coach Bill Berry, the latter whom coached for two games before Cartwright was named interim head coach. The Bulls finished 21–61 on the year and the following season Cartwright was promoted from interim to permanent head coach. In the 2002–03 season the Bulls finished 30–52, but Cartwright would last only 14 games into the 2003–04 season — going 4–10 — before being fired. Pete Myers and finally Scott Skiles coached the Bulls immediately following Cartwright&#x27;s tenure.

In 2004, the New Jersey Nets hired Cartwright as an assistant coach under Lawrence Frank. In 2008, Cartwright was named as an assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns under Terry Porter. Suns general manager Steve Kerr hired the former big man to help coach veteran big man Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, all-star Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, and upcoming draft picks. After the Suns dismissed Porter and promoted assistant Alvin Gentry, Cartwright stayed on as assistant coach with the team.

In January 2013, Cartwright was hired to coach Osaka Evessa of the Japanese bj league. There, he was credited for turning the franchise around. When Cartwright arrived, Evessa had lost 19 of its 24 games. With Cartwright at the helm, the team won 17 of its final 28 games, including 10 straight at one point, posting a 22-30 record for the season. He did not return the following season, citing his desire to be closer to his family in Chicago.

In September 2014, Cartwright was hired as the head coach of the Mexico men&#x27;s national basketball team ahead of the 2014 Central American and Caribbean Games, replacing recently fired Sergio Valdeolmillos. Five months later, he was replaced by Eddie Casiano who himself was fired after only two months without coaching a game and replaced by the aforementioned Valdeolmillos.

==Personal life==
Cartwright married his junior high school sweetheart, Sheri, and together they have four children (Justin, Jason, James and Kristin). He also has two grandkids. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in sociology from USF and later obtained a master&#x27;s degree in organization development in 1998 from the same institution. In 2016, Cartwright became USF&#x27;s director of university initiatives.

Cartwright is an avid fan of doo-wop music from the 1950s and 1960s, and plays guitar and collects transistor radios as hobbies.

<text>William Thomas Murray (May 25, 1877 – August 17, 1954) was an American singer and voice actor. He was one of the most popular singers in the United States in the early 20th century. While he received star billing in Vaudeville, he was best known for his prolific work in the recording studio, making records for almost every record label of the era. Murray was the best-selling recording artist of the first quarter of the 20th century, selling over 300 million records during the phonograph era.

==Life and career==
Billy Murray was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Patrick and Julia (Kelleher) Murray, immigrants from County Kerry, Ireland. His parents moved to Denver, Colorado, in 1882, where he grew up. He became fascinated with the theater and joined a traveling vaudeville troupe in 1893. He also performed in minstrel shows early in his career. In 1897 Murray made his first recordings for Peter Bacigalupi, the owner of a phonograph company in San Francisco. As of 2024, none of Murray&#x27;s cylinder records with Bacigalupi are known to have survived. In 1903, he started recording regularly in the New York City and New Jersey area, where major record companies in the U.S., as well as the Tin Pan Alley music industry, were concentrated.

In 1906, he recorded the first of his popular duets with Ada Jones. He also performed with Aileen Stanley, the Haydn Quartet, the American Quartet (also known as the Premier Quartet), and Elsie Baker; as well as performed solo work.

Nicknamed &quot;The Denver Nightingale&quot;, Murray had a strong tenor voice with excellent enunciation and a conversational delivery compared with bel canto singers of the era. His delivery was so precise and pointed that his vocals were easy to understand and enjoy. This is why he was the favorite vocalist of Thomas Edison, whose impaired hearing made it difficult for him to appreciate recorded songs. 

On comic songs, Billy Murray often deliberately sang slightly flat, which he felt helped the comic effect. Although he often performed romantic numbers and ballads which sold well, his comedy and novelty song recordings continue to be popular with later generations of record collectors.

Murray was a devoted baseball fan, and he is said to have played with the New York Highlanders (Yankees) in exhibition games. He also supposedly sometimes called in sick to record sessions to go to the ballpark. Murray recorded &quot;Tessie, You Are the Only, Only, Only&quot;, which became the unofficial theme of the 1903 World Series, when the words were changed from &quot;Tessie, you know I love you madly&quot; to &quot;Honus, why do you hit so badly?&quot;

Murray&#x27;s popularity faded as public taste changed and recording technology advanced; the rise of the electric microphone in the mid-1920s allowed vocalists to sing less loudly and more intimately and expressively. Murray&#x27;s &quot;hammering&quot; style, as he called it – essentially yelling the song into an acoustic recording horn – did not work in the electrical era, and he had to learn to soften his voice.

Though his singing style was less in demand, he continued to find recording work. Some of the lower-budgeted recording companies were slow to convert to the new microphone technology and continued to record acoustically, which offered further opportunities for Murray&#x27;s full-voiced singing. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, the music from his early days was considered nostalgic, and Murray was in demand again. He did voices for animated cartoons, especially Max Fleischer&#x27;s popular &quot;Bouncing Ball&quot; sing-along cartoons and the Fleischer character Bimbo. He also did radio work. In 1929, Murray and Walter Scanlon provided the voices for the Fleischer short animated film &quot;Finding His Voice&quot;, produced by Western Electric.

Murray made his last recordings for Beacon Records on February 11, 1943, with Jewish dialect comedian Monroe Silver. He retired the next year to Freeport, Long Island, New York because of heart problems.

&quot;Variety&quot; estimated he made between 6,000 and 10,000 recordings in 45 years under a range of different pseudonyms, selling up to 300 million records, a record at the time.

He died at nearby Jones Beach of a heart attack in 1954 at the age of 77. Murray had married three times; the first two marriages ended in divorce. He was survived by his third wife, Madeleine, and is buried in the Cemetery of the Holy Rood in Westbury, New York.

==In popular culture==
The song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Floating Down the Old Green River&quot; was sampled in &quot;Otonoke&quot;, a 2024 hip-hop song by Japanese duo Creepy Nuts.

<text>The semiconductor industry is the aggregate of companies engaged in the design and fabrication of semiconductors and semiconductor devices, such as transistors and integrated circuits. Its roots can be traced to the invention of the transistor by Shockley, Brattain, and Bardeen at Bell Labs in 1948. Bell Labs licensed the technology for $25,000, and soon many companies, including Motorola (1952), Schockley Semiconductor (1955), Sylvania, Centralab, Fairchild Semiconductor and Texas Instruments were making transistors. In 1958 Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments and Robert Noyce of Fairchild independently invented the Integrated Circuit, a method of producing multiple transistors on a single &quot;chip&quot; of Semiconductor material. This kicked off a number of rapid advances in fabrication technology leading to the exponential growth in semiconductor device production, known as Moore&#x27;s law that has persisted over the past six or so decades. The industry&#x27;s annual semiconductor sales revenue has since grown to over , as of 2018.

In 2010, the semiconductor industry had the highest intensity of Research &amp; Development in the EU and ranked second after Biotechnology in the EU, United States and Japan combined. 

The semiconductor industry is in turn the driving force behind the wider electronics industry, with annual power electronics sales of £135billion () as of 2011, annual consumer electronics sales expected to reach by 2020, tech industry sales expected to reach in 2019, and e-commerce with over in 2017. In 2019, 32.4% of the semiconductor market segment was for networks and communications devices.

In 2021, the sales of semiconductors reached a record $555.9 billion, up 26.2%, with sales in China reaching $192.5 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. A record 1.15 trillion semiconductor units were shipped in the calendar year. The semiconductor industry is projected to reach $726.73 billion by 2027.

==Industry structure==
The global semiconductor industry is dominated by companies from the United States, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands, with Israel and Germany having significant presence in the field.


Unique features of the industry include continuous growth but in a cyclical pattern with high volatility. While the current 20-year annual average growth of the semiconductor industry is on the order of 13%, this has been accompanied by equally above-average market volatility, which can lead to significant if not dramatic cyclical swings. This has required the need for high degrees of flexibility and innovation in order to constantly adjust to the rapid pace of change in the market as many products embedding semiconductor devices often have a very short life cycle.

At the same time, the rate of constant price-performance improvement in the semiconductor industry is staggering. As a consequence, changes in the semiconductor market not only occur extremely rapidly but also anticipate changes in industries evolving at a slower pace. The semiconductor industry is widely recognized as a key driver and technology enabler for the whole electronics value chain.

Prior to the 1980s, the semiconductor industry was vertically integrated. Semiconductor companies both designed and manufactured chips in their own facilities. In many cases, this included inventing new processes, refining and purifying source chemicals and silicon wafers, and even manufacturing equipment, like furnaces, lithography tools and etchers. These companies also carried out the assembly and testing of their chips. Over time, many of these functions were outsourced, such that today semiconductor manufacturers rely on a complex supply chain to provide wafers, high purity source chemicals, and processing equipment. Further, starting with LSI in 1969, the industry has seen the emergence of Fabless Semiconductor Companies that focus solely on chip design and rely on other companies to manufacture their designs. Initially, these other companies were integrated device manufacturers (IDMs), companies that also designed and manufactured their own products, and thus were often competitors of the Fabless companies. But, by the mid-1980&#x27;s TSMC and UMC emerged as foundries, specializing solely in the manufacture of other companies&#x27; designs.

Today, much of the industry is based on the foundry model, which consists of semiconductor fabrication plants (foundries) and integrated circuit design operations, each belonging to separate companies or subsidiaries. Some companies, known as integrated device manufacturers, both design and manufacture semiconductors. The foundry model has resulted in consolidation among foundries. As of 2021, only three firms are able to manufacture the most advanced semiconductors: TSMC of Taiwan, Samsung of South Korea, and Intel of the United States. Part of this is due to the high capital costs of building foundries. TSMC&#x27;s latest factory, capable of fabricating 3 nm process semiconductors and completed in 2020, cost $19.5 billion.

Intel is considering outsourcing some production to TSMC. It currently can only produce 10 nm semiconductors, while TSMC and Samsung can both produce 5 nm. GlobalFoundries, an American-headquartered firm, uses a 12 nm process for its most advanced chips due to the rapidly increasing development costs of smaller process nodes.

Notes:
*Pure-play foundries They specialize in foundry services. They may or may not offer design services to third parties, as well as mask (photomask) making, semiconductor packaging and testing services, which can also be outsourced to other companies. An example is TSMC, which offers design, testing and packaging services, TCE photomasks, which offers only mask making services, and ChipMOS, which offers only packaging and testing services.
*IDMs (integrated device manufacturers) They may or may not offer foundry services.
*Fabless suppliers They do not offer foundry services. They may or may not offer design services to third parties.

<doc id="612817" wikidata="Q1604776" url="?curid=612817" title="Hemicorporectomy">
<text>Hemicorporectomy is a radical surgery in which the body below the waist is amputated, transecting the lumbar spine. This removes the legs, the genitalia (internal and external), urinary system, pelvic bones, anus, and rectum. It is a major procedure recommended only as a last resort for people with severe and potentially fatal illnesses such as osteomyelitis, tumors, severe traumas and intractable decubiti in, or around, the pelvis. By 2009, 66 cases had been reported in medical literature.

==Medical uses==
The operation is performed to treat spreading cancers of the spinal cord and pelvic bones. Other reasons may include trauma affecting the pelvic girdle (&quot;open-book fracture&quot;), uncontrollable abscess or ulcers of the pelvic region (causing sepsis) or other locally uncontainable conditions. It is used in cases wherein even pelvic exenteration would not remove sufficient tissue.

==Procedure==
The surgical procedure is typically done in two stages, but it is possible to conduct the surgery in one stage. The first stage is the discontinuation of the waste functions by performing a colostomy and ileal conduit in the upper abdominal quadrants. The second stage is the amputation at the lumbar spine.

==Considerations==

With the removal of almost half of the circulatory system, cardiac function needs to be closely monitored while a new blood pressure set-point develops.

Removal of large parts of the colon can lead to loss of electrolytes. Similarly, calculated measurements of renal function (such as the Cockcroft-Gault formula) are unlikely to reflect actual activity of the kidney, as these calculations were developed for patients in whom the circulatory system correlates with the body weight; this relation is lost in a post-hemicorporectomy patient.

==Rehabilitation==

Extensive physiotherapy and occupational therapy are necessary after the procedure. A return to mobility generally involves the use of a wheelchair and potentially a prosthetic. Designing a prosthesis for the removed body parts is difficult, as there is generally no remaining pelvic girdle musculature (unless this has been spared expressly).

==Traumatic hemicorporectomy==
Individuals sustaining a severe bisection injury that is essentially a &quot;de facto&quot; hemicorporectomy rarely reach a hospital before dying. Apart from the very low likelihood of surviving such an injury, even an operative hemicorporectomy is unlikely to be successful unless the patient has &quot;sufficient emotional and psychological maturity to cope&quot; and &quot;sufficient determination and physical strength to undergo the intensive rehabilitation&quot;.

Emergency rooms and ambulance service policies advise against the resuscitation of such patients. The UK&#x27;s National Health Service, for example, in its &quot;Policy and Procedures for the Recognition of Life Extinct&quot; describes traumatic hemicorporectomy (along with decapitation) as &quot;unequivocally associated with death&quot; and that such injuries should be considered &quot;incompatible with life&quot; in patients under 18. The National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP) and the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (COT) have also released similar position statements and policy allowing on-scene personnel to determine if patients are to be considered unresuscitatable.

In one case documented by the &quot;Archives of Emergency Medicine&quot; in 1989, a woman who sustained a complete corporal transection (hemicorporectomy) after being struck by a train arrived at a hospital in a &quot;fully conscious&quot; state and &quot;was aware of the nature of her injury and wished for further treatment.&quot; Although the patient was initially stabilized and underwent three hours of emergency surgery, she died approximately two hours later due to &quot;hypovolemia, cardiac arrhythmia and biochemical imbalance.&quot;

==Prosthesis==

Following a hemicorporectomy, patients are fitted with a socket-type prosthesis often referred to as a bucket. Early bucket designs often presented significant pressure problems for patients, but new devices have incorporated an inflatable rubber lining composed of air pockets that evenly distributes pressure based on the patient&#x27;s motions. Two openings at the front of the bucket create space for the colostomy bag and the ileal conduit.

==History==
The development of surgical medicine was vastly accelerated during, and following, the Second World War. Rarely-experienced traumas were made more common by new weaponry. This required decisive surgical action as well as the development of new techniques. As B. E. Ferrara stated in his summative article on hemicorporectomy,

Lessons learned from battlefield injuries quickened innovative treatment of congenital and acquired conditions ... [the general surgeon] devised extensive cancer operations including extended radical mastectomy, radical gastrectomy and pancreatectomy, pelvic exenteration, the &#x27;Commando Operation&#x27; (tongue, jaw and neck dissection), bilateral back dissection, hemipelvectomy, and then hemicorporectomy or translumbar amputation, referred to as the most revolutionary of all operative procedures.

It was into this environment that Frederick E. Kredel first proposed the operation in February 1951 while discussing a paper on pelvic exenteration.

== List of people with hemicorporectomy ==
* Tammy Reed who was known as Angel, had a hemicorporectomy in 2010. Angel was a paraplegic and without the surgery, chronic sores and infection would have killed her within 18 months. Angel passed away on 25 March 2019.
*Army Sgt. Joseph Grabianowski had a hemicorporectomy in 2012 after a road side bomb and a buried explosive severely injured him in Afghanistan.
* Loren Schauers, an American man, had a hemicorporectomy in 2019 after a traumatic forklift accident. Loren and his wife Sabia have a YouTube channel where they document Loren’s new lifestyle without half of his body.

<doc id="612823" wikidata="Q3807921" url="?curid=612823" title="Joanie Loves Chachi">
<text>Joanie Loves Chachi is an American sitcom television series and a spin-off of &quot;Happy Days&quot; that aired on ABC from March 23, 1982, to May 24, 1983. It stars Erin Moran and Scott Baio as the characters Joanie Cunningham and Chachi Arcola, respectively. The series was cancelled after 17 episodes, in its second season, due to a drop in ratings.

==Storyline==
The series is set in the early to mid-1960s and follows the exploits of Joanie and Chachi as they moved to Chicago and tried to make it on their own with a rock band and a music career at a time when the British Invasion was looming (one episode was titled &quot;Beatlemania&quot;). It mixed the traditional elements of a sitcom with musical performances on each show by Baio and Moran; their characters sang to one another in the opening credit sequence of the show. Their backup band consists of a spaced-out drummer named Bingo and Chachi&#x27;s blasé cousins Mario and Annette.

The series also starred Ellen Travolta as Louisa Delvecchio, Chachi&#x27;s mother, and Al Molinaro as Al Delvecchio, Chachi&#x27;s stepfather (and formerly the owner of Arnold&#x27;s Drive-In in &quot;Happy Days&quot;), who opened a restaurant in which Chachi and Joanie performed most of their music. Art Metrano played Chachi&#x27;s uncle Rico Mastorelli, who was the band&#x27;s manager and helped Joanie and Chachi advance in their careers. Winifred Freedman played Rico&#x27;s daughter, Annette, Chachi&#x27;s cousin and bandmate.

Like other Garry Marshall-related sitcoms such as &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; had its share of anachronisms. The show was set in the 1960s yet characters were styled in a manner more true to the 1980s.

==Production==
&quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; was the first Miller-Boyett (and only Garry Marshall–produced) sitcom developed by Thomas L. Miller and Robert L. Boyett, and was created by Lowell Ganz and Garry Marshall. This is the only Garry Marshall/Miller-Boyett sitcom that does not have Charles Fox and/or Norman Gimbel as the show&#x27;s theme song/music cue composer.

An urban legend circulated that the show was the highest-rated American program ever in Korea due to &quot;chachi&quot; being a Korean word for &quot;penis&quot;. In actuality, the show was never broadcast to the general public of Korea, only to U.S. servicemen stationed in South Korea, and has never even been dubbed or subtitled in Korean.

Scott Baio later recalled:
All the &quot;Happy Days&quot; people had written the first four episodes, when the show got picked up for series, but then they left to go back to &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and we were stuck with new writers who didn&#x27;t know us. So that was a problem. And then some of the people on the show had chemical issues, and &quot;that&quot; was a problem. It was just on and on and on, and it just sort of all crumbled and fell apart. In retrospect, if given the choice again, I would not have done that show. That was just the wrong idea. If I had to do it all over again, I would&#x27;ve waited &#x27;til &quot;Happy Days&quot; was over until I did anything else. [emphasis in original]

Erin Moran also recalled:
I liked working with the people. But I didn&#x27;t even want to do it. I wanted to stay on &quot;Happy Days&quot;. They were running them at the same time.

==Episodes==
===Series overview===
===Season 1 (1982)===
===Season 2 (1982–1983)===
==Home media==
On February 4, 2014, CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) released &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

==Reception==
The show debuted as a mid-season replacement and initially attracted high ratings, benefiting from two factors: it aired immediately following its parent series, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, and had only reruns competing for its time slot. The ratings plummeted in Season 2 with a move to Thursday nights, which put &quot;Joanie Loves Chachi&quot; up against CBS&#x27; &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, and it was pulled from the schedule by the year&#x27;s end, with its final two episodes airing in the spring of 1983. The characters were rolled back into &quot;Happy Days&quot; for that program&#x27;s final season. ABC determined that the show was losing too much of its lead-in, suggesting low appeal if the show were moved.

In 2010, TV Guide Network listed the show at #17 on its list of &quot;25 Biggest TV Blunders&quot;.

<doc id="612826" wikidata="Q1629446" url="?curid=612826" title="Ryan FR Fireball">
<text>The Ryan FR Fireball is an American mixed-power (piston and jet-powered) fighter aircraft designed by Ryan Aeronautical for the United States Navy during World War II. It was the Navy&#x27;s first aircraft with a jet engine. Only 66 aircraft were built before Japan surrendered in August 1945. The FR-1 Fireball equipped a single squadron before the war&#x27;s end, but did not see combat. The aircraft ultimately proved to lack the structural strength required for operations aboard aircraft carriers and was withdrawn in mid-1947.

==Design and development==
Design of the FR-1 began in 1943 to a proposal instigated by Admiral John S. McCain Sr. for a mixed-powered fighter because early jet engines had sluggish acceleration that was considered unsafe and unsuitable for carrier operations. Ryan received a contract for three XFR-1 prototypes and one static test airframe on 11 February 1943 with the first two prototypes delivered in 14 months. Another contract was placed for 100 aircraft on 2 December 1943 and a later contract on 31 January 1945 increased the total of FR-1s on order to 700.

The XFR-1 was a single-seat, low-wing monoplane with tricycle landing gear. A Wright R-1820-72W Cyclone radial engine was mounted in the fighter&#x27;s nose while a General Electric I-16 (later redesignated as the J-31) turbojet was mounted in the rear fuselage. It was fed by ducts in each wing root which meant that the wing had to be relatively thick to house the ducts and the outward-retracting main landing gear. To simplify the fuel system, both engines used the same grade of avgas. Two self-sealing fuel tanks were housed in the fuselage, one of and the other of . The cockpit was positioned just forward of the leading edge of the wing and the pilot was provided with a bubble canopy which gave him excellent visibility. The XFR-1 had the first laminar flow airfoil in a navy carrier aircraft.

The Fireball was armed with four .50 in (12.7 mm) M2 Browning machine guns with 300 rounds per gun. They were mounted in the center section of the wing, immediately outboard of the air intakes for the jet engine. Four 5-inch (127 mm) rockets could be carried under each outer wing panel and two hardpoints were provided under the center section for 1,000 lb (454 kg) bombs or drop tanks. Armor plates were provided in front and behind the pilot&#x27;s seat and for the oil cooler.

The first XFR-1 made its first flight on 25 June 1944 without its jet engine, but this was installed shortly afterward. The second prototype first flew on 20 September 1944. Test flights confirmed wind tunnel tests that revealed a lack of longitudinal stability because the center of gravity had been miscalculated. In addition, the circular rear fuselage of the FR-1 gave less stability than the slab-style fuselage of the Grumman F4F Wildcat that was used as a model for the stability calculations. A new tail with enlarged vertical and horizontal stabilizers was designed and retrofitted to the prototypes. The original Douglas double-slotted flaps proved to be unsatisfactory during flight testing, but all three prototypes and the first 14 production aircraft were built with them before they were replaced with a single-slotted flap.

The first prototype was lost in a crash at NAS China Lake on 13 October 1944. Investigation showed that the wing structure was not strong enough to resist compressibility effects. This was cured by doubling the number of rivets in the outer wing panels. The second prototype crashed on 25 March 1945 when the pilot failed to recover from a dive from , probably also due to compressibility effects. The third prototype crashed on 5 April when the canopy blew off during a high-speed pass over Lindbergh Field.

Operational testing by the Naval Air Test Center at Naval Air Station Patuxent River that included carrier acceptability tests revealed additional problems: The piston engine tended to overheat until electrically operated cowl flaps were installed, the catapult hooks had to be moved, and the nosewheel oleo shock strut had to be lengthened by . Carrier suitability tests began aboard the escort carrier in early January 1945. The aircraft successfully made five catapult takeoffs using the piston engine as well as three takeoffs using both engines. No problems were reported when landing aboard the carrier.
The FR-1 Fireball was further developed into the XFR-2 which utilized a 1,425 hp (1,063 kW) Wright R-1820-74W in place of the -72W. One single airframe was converted to this configuration. No prototypes were built for the next proposed variant, the FR-3, which would have used a General Electric I-20 turbojet. Both of these projects were canceled with the end of the war. The fastest Fireball was the XFR-4, which had a Westinghouse J34 turbojet and was approximately 100 mph (160 km/h) faster than the FR-1. The turbojet&#x27;s air intakes were moved from the wing roots to the fuselage in front of the wing; they were covered by electrically powered doors to lessen drag when the aircraft was flying only on its piston engine. The Fireball&#x27;s fuselage was lengthened by to accommodate the larger engine and the leading edge extension of the wing root that housed the air intakes was also removed. The XFR-4 was intended to serve as a testbed for the turbojet installation on the XF2R-1 Dark Shark. This was the final variant; the piston engine was replaced with a General Electric XT31-GE-2 turboprop, but only one prototype was built.

On 2 December 1943, orders for 100 production FR-1s were placed, with a follow-up order of 1,000 additional fighters in January 1945. All of the contracts were contingent on the aircraft successfully completing carrier trials. Only 66 Fireballs were completed by November 1945 as orders for 1,044 FR-1s were canceled on VJ Day.

==Operational history==
One squadron, VF-66, received its first Fireballs in March 1945, but they never saw combat. On 1 May, three of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft were craned aboard the carrier to attempt to qualify seven pilots, but two of the fighters were damaged while landing. One missed the arresting gear and hit the crash barrier while the other aircraft&#x27;s nose gear collapsed. The following month the pilots qualified and were on pre- leave when the Japanese surrendered. The squadron was ed on 18 October with all pilots and aircraft transferred to VF-41.

It has been claimed that a Fireball of VF-41 became the first aircraft to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning, on 6 November 1945. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship&#x27;s crash barrier. However, there is evidence that the aircraft may have still benefited from some residual power from its Wright R-1820 and therefore the landing was not purely under jet power. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.
The squadron qualified on the escort carrier in March 1946, but nose gear problems persisted and cut the cruise short. Ryan installed a steel fork for the nosewheel, but inspections also revealed evidence of partial wing failures so the aircraft was limited to maneuvers not to exceed 5 Gs. VF-41 suffered three fatal accidents in 1946 before being redesignated as VF-1E on 15 November 1946. One ensign collided with the target banner during gunnery practice and spun into the water. A few months later, the squadron commander was performing a barrel roll when his wing broke off and he struck another Fireball, killing both pilots.

VF-1E conducted carrier qualification in March 1947 aboard the escort carrier and only eight pilots successfully qualified, not least because the FR-1s were proving to be too fragile to endure repeated carrier landings. During one brief deployment in June aboard , one aircraft broke in two during a hard landing. Subsequent inspections of the squadron&#x27;s aircraft showed signs of structural failure and all the Fireballs were withdrawn by 1 August 1947.

After the withdrawal of the type from service, except for a few examples retained for modifications and testing, the FR-1s were scrapped.

* United States Navy

The &quot;Firebirds&quot; squadron was known under three names:
* VF-66 (March 1945 – 15 October 1945)
* VF-41 (15 October 1945 – 1 August 1947), redesignated VF-1E on 15 November 1946.
==Surviving aircraft==
Only a single example, FR-1 BuNo 39657, still survives. Deployed first to the NASA Ames Research Center, the aircraft served as an instructional airframe at a technical school before being acquired by the Planes of Fame Air Museum at Chino, California from a technical school located in San Luis Obispo, California in the 1960s. After restoration to static display condition, 39657 was rolled out at Chino on 13 June 2009.

<doc id="612830" wikidata="Q2025611" url="?curid=612830" title="Open Artwork System Interchange Standard">
<text>Open Artwork System Interchange Standard (OASIS) is a binary file format used for specification of data structures for photomask production. It&#x27;s used to represent a pattern an interchange and encapsulation format for hierarchical integrated circuit mask layout information produced during integrated circuit design that is further used for manufacturing of a photomask. The standard is developed by SEMI. The language defines the code required for geometric shapes such as rectangles, trapezoids, and polygons. It defines the type of properties each can have, how they can be organized into cells containing patterns made by these shapes and defines how each can be placed relative to each other. It is similar to GDSII.

As of 2023 the cost of the standard for members of SEMI was set to $252 and non-members: US$335.

==Introduction==

OASIS is the purported commercial successor to the integrated circuit design and manufacturing electronic pattern layout language, GDSII.

GDSII was created in the 1970s when integrated circuit designs had a few hundred thousand geometric shapes, properties and placements to manage. Today, there can be billions of shapes, properties, and placements to manage. File sizes of GDSII format often takes tens of gigabytes of storage and are difficult to store and process. OASIS creators and users claimed that the growth of workstations&#x27; data storage and handling capabilities was far outpaced by the growth of Integrated Circuit layout complexity. Therefore, OASIS tries to solve the purported problem of the large size of the GDSII files by introducing complicated types of the geometric shapes (25 types of trapezoids only) to reduce the data size. Also, variable-length numeric format (similar to Run-length encoding) for coordinates was implemented. Finally, each cell in the OASIS file can be independently compressed by the gzip-like algorithm.

The effort to create the OASIS format started in June 2001. The release of version 1.0 took place in March 2004. Its use required the development of new OASIS readers and writers that could be coupled to design and manufacturing equipment already equipped with GDSII readers and writers. Its adoption was born of a concerted effort by integrated circuit design, equipment, photomask, fabless, 3rd party Intellectual Property (IP) and manufacturing companies from the United States, Japan, Taiwan, Korea and Europe.

A constrained version of OASIS, called OASIS.MASK, addresses the unique needs of semiconductor photomask manufacturing equipment such as pattern generators and inspection systems. Both OASIS and OASIS.MASK are industry standards.

==Example datafile==
Below is a human-readable text representation of the OASIS binary file that allowed the expression of the above &quot;top&quot; cell view called &quot;Placed_shapes_and_cells_within_an_IC_cell&quot;. The top cell is defined by a file-level standard PROPERTY record named S_TOP_CELL. The PROPERTY record below references a PROPNAME record (refNum=0) that has a &quot;propname-string&quot; called S_TOP_CELL. The top cell contains the placement of three cells called &quot;bottom cells&quot;. Bottom cells contain geometric shapes only.

Each line of the OASIS representation below contains (from the left) a record number and a record type followed by a set of values that define that record type. For instance, the first RECTANGLE record below defines the following type of rectangle shape, its size and its absolute location:

* Layer
* Datatype
* Width
* Height
* Lower-left x-coordinate
* Lower-left y-coordinate

Absent in this RECTANGLE record is an option to describe the locations of repeated instances of the rectangle. Also, this record type allows the description of a square by defining the value for the width only. To enable these descriptions, one must set what is referred to as the bit pattern for the RECTANGLE record. For a RECTANGLE record, the bit pattern (either a 1 (enabled) or a 0 (disabled)) is:

 SWHXYRDL (Square,Width,Height,X-coordinate,Y-coordinate,Repetition,Datatype,Layer-number).

For this RECTANGLE record, the bit pattern is set to 0WHXY0DL (Not a square,Width,Height,X-coordinate,Y-coordinate,Not repetitive,Datatype,Layer-number). The first and second RECTANGLE records in cell &quot;Cell_Placed_Shapes_2&quot; (CELL refNum=1)&quot; define repeated instances of a rectangle. The first RECTANGLE record (SW0XYRDL) uses a type 10 repetition (rep=rep10). The second RECTANGLE record (0WHXYR0L) uses a type 11 repetition (rep=Rep11). There are a total of eleven repetition types (Rep1-Rep11). In the second RECTANGLE record bit pattern, the datatype(D) was set to &#x27;0&#x27; because the same datatype used in the first RECTANGLE record applies to the second RECTANGLE record. Other OASIS-supported geometric shapes having the record types POLYGON, TRAPEZOID, CTRAPEZOID, CIRCLE and PATH are defined by different bit patterns.

According to the CELLNAME records below, the bottom cells have the following &quot;cellname-strings&quot; &quot;Cell_Placed_Shapes_1, . . . _2 and . . . _3&quot;. Each &quot;layer-number&quot; that had been assigned to a geometric shape has an association with a LAYERNAME record that defines a &quot;layer-interval&quot; and a &quot;layername-string&quot;. In this view, the &quot;layername-string&quot;, &quot;Layer_Color_Mapping&quot;, defines the layer intervals used in a layer color table &quot;layercolormap.data&quot;.

The example below was not meant to be an exhaustive description of the OASIS language. The objective was to give the interested reader a general understanding of the scope of the OASIS language and how it applies to the representation and the expression of the electronic layout patterns that define an integrated circuit.

<text>Qin Jiushao (, ca. 1202–1261), courtesy name Daogu (道古), was a Chinese mathematician, meteorologist, inventor, politician, and writer. He is credited for discovering Horner&#x27;s method as well as inventing Tianchi basins, a type of rain gauge instrument used to gather meteorological data.

== Biography ==
Although Qin Jiushao was born in Ziyang, Sichuan, his family came from Shandong province. He is regarded as one of the greatest mathematicians in Chinese history. This is especially remarkable because Qin did not devote his life to mathematics. He was accomplished in many other fields and held a series of bureaucratic positions in several Chinese provinces.

Qin wrote &quot;Shùshū Jiǔzhāng&quot; (&quot;Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections&quot;) in 1247 CE. This treatise covered a variety of topics including indeterminate equations and the numerical solution of certain polynomial equations up to 10th order, as well as discussions on military matters and surveying. In the treatise Qin included a general form of the Chinese remainder theorem that used &quot;Da yan shu&quot; (大衍术) or algorithms to solve it. In geometry, he discovered &quot;Qin Jiushao&#x27;s formula&quot; for finding the area of a triangle from the given lengths of three sides. This formula is the same as Heron&#x27;s formula, proved by Heron of Alexandria about 60 BCE, though knowledge of the formula may go back to Archimedes.

As precipitation was important agriculture and food production, Qin developed precipitation gauges that was widely used in 1247 during the Mongol Empire/Southern Song dynasty to gather meteorological data. Qin Jiushao later records the application of rainfall measurements in the mathematical treatise. The book also discusses the use of large snow gauges made from bamboo situated in mountain passes and uplands which are speculated to be first referenced to snow measurement. 
Qin recorded the earliest explanation of how Chinese calendar experts calculated astronomical data according to the timing of the winter solstice. Among his accomplishments are the introduction techniques for solving certain types of algebraic equations using a numerical algorithm (equivalent to the 19th century Horner&#x27;s method) and for finding sums of arithmetic series. He also introduced the use of the zero symbol into written Chinese mathematics.

After he completed his work on mathematics, he ventured into politics. As a government official he was boastful, corrupt, and was accused of bribery and of poisoning his enemies. As a result, he was relieved of his duties multiple times. Yet in spite of these problems he managed to become very wealthy (Katz, 1993).

<text>If... is a 1968 British satirical drama film produced and directed by Lindsay Anderson, and starring Malcolm McDowell as the character Mick Travis, who appeared in two further Anderson films. Other actors include Richard Warwick, Christine Noonan, David Wood, and Robert Swann. A satire of English public school life, the film follows a group of pupils who stage a savage insurrection at a boys&#x27; boarding school. The film was the subject of controversy at the time of its release, receiving an X certificate for its depictions of violence.

== Plot ==
The pupils return after the summer for a new Michaelmas term at a traditional British public school for boys in the late 1960s. Mick Travis arrives hiding his moustache, which he quickly shaves off. He, Wallace, and Knightly are three non-conformist boys in the lower sixth form, their penultimate year. They are watched and persecuted by the &quot;Whips&quot;, upper sixth-formers given authority as prefects over the other boys. The junior boys are made to act as personal servants for the Whips, who discuss them as sex objects.

The headmaster is remote from the boys and the housemasters. The protagonists&#x27; housemaster, Mr. Kemp, is easily manipulated by the Whips into giving them free rein in enforcing discipline. Some schoolmasters are shown behaving bizarrely.

Mick and Johnny sneak off the school grounds and steal a motorbike from a showroom. They ride to a café staffed by an unnamed girl, about whom Mick fantasizes wrestling naked. Meanwhile, Wallace spends time with a younger boy, Bobby Philips, and later shares his bed.

The three boys drink vodka in their study and consider how one man holds the potential to &quot;change the world with a bullet in the right place.&quot; Their clashes with school authorities become increasingly contentious. Eventually, a brutal caning by the Whips spurs them to action.

During a school Combined Cadet Force military drill, Mick acquires live ammunition, which he, Wallace, and Knightly use to open fire on a group of boys and masters, including Kemp and the school chaplain. When the latter orders the boys to drop their weapons, Mick assaults him and cows him into submission.

As punishment for their actions, the trio are ordered by the headmaster to clean out a large storeroom beneath the main school hall. They discover a cache of firearms, including automatic weapons and mortars. Joined by Philips and the girl from the café, they commit to revolt against the establishment.

On Founders&#x27; Day, when parents are visiting the school, the group starts a fire under the hall, smoking everyone out of the building. They then open fire on them from the rooftop. Led by a visiting general who had been giving a speech, the staff, students, and parents break open the Combined Cadet Force armoury and begin firing back. The headmaster tries to stop the fight, imploring the group to listen to reason. The girl shoots him between the eyes. The battle continues, and the camera closes in on Mick&#x27;s face as he keeps firing.

== Influences ==
The film&#x27;s surrealist sequences have been compared to Jean Vigo&#x27;s French classic &quot;Zéro de conduite&quot; (1933). Anderson acknowledged an influence, and described how he arranged a viewing of that film with his screenwriters, Sherwin and Howlett, at an early stage in production planning, though in his view the Vigo film&#x27;s influence on &quot;If...&quot; was structural rather than merely cosmetic. &quot;Seeing Vigo&#x27;s film gave us the idea and also the confidence to proceed with the kind of scene-structure that we devised for the first part of the film particularly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA 1/6/3/8&quot;&gt;Extract from letter written in 1976 by Lindsay Anderson to Jack Landman in which he discusses the parallels between If.. and [[Jean Vigo]&#x27;s [[Zéro de Conduite]] (LA 1/6/3/8), &quot;The Anderson Collection&quot;, [[University of Stirling]], accessed 14 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
===Screenplay===
[[David Sherwin]]&#x27;s original title for the screenplay was &quot;Crusaders&quot;, during the writing of which he drew heavily from his experiences at [[Tonbridge School]] in Kent. In 1960, he and his friend and co-writer [[John Howlett]] took it to director [[Seth Holt]]. Holt felt unqualified to direct, but offered to produce the film. They also took it to Sherwin&#x27;s hero, &quot;[[Rebel Without a Cause]]&quot; director [[Nicholas Ray]], who liked it but had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] before anything came of it. Holt introduced Sherwin to [[Lindsay Anderson]] in a [[Soho]] pub.

===Filming===
The school used for the early filming on location was Anderson&#x27;s &quot;[[alma mater]]&quot;, [[Cheltenham College]], Gloucestershire, but this was not made public at the time under the agreement needed to shoot there. The then headmaster, David Ashcroft, persuaded the school governors to agree that the film could be made. [[Aldenham School]] in [[Elstree]], Hertfordshire, was used for later scenes filmed after previous summer commitments prevented further shooting at Cheltenham. The sweat room scenes were filmed in the School Room in School House at Aldenham School (though they were redesigned for the film). The dormitory scenes were also at Aldenham—specifically The Long Room for the junior boys, and the room with the wooden partitions called Lower Cubs (short for cubicles). The shower scene and toilets were in School House changing rooms.

The transport cafe was the (now demolished) Packhorse Cafe on the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5/Watling Street]] in [[Kensworth]], Dunstable, Bedfordshire, close to the Packhorse Pub. The painting in the dining hall is of Aldenham School&#x27;s founder, Richard Platt. The Hall scene was an amalgamation of the school halls at Cheltenham and Aldenham. [[Beddington#Carew Manor|Carew Manor]], in [[Beddington]], Surrey, was used for the opening staircase scene and for several other scenes. It was filmed during the summer when the school had closed for holidays. Some scenes were shot at the former [[Trinity School of John Whitgift]] in central Croydon, before it was demolished to make way for the [[Whitgift Centre]]; pupil extras from the separate [[Whitgift School]] were engaged at £5 per day.

Anderson originally approached [[Charterhouse School]] and later [[Cranleigh School]] for permission to shoot the film: negotiations were going well until the schools discovered the content of the film and pulled out. The outside shots of the school including the final showdown on the roof were filmed at Cheltenham College after term ended. The Speech Day interior was filmed inside St John&#x27;s Church on Albion Street, [[Cheltenham]]. The church was later demolished. The motorbike shop was filmed at the Broadway Motor Company on Gladstone Road, [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]].

The film makes use of [[black and white]] sequences. In the audio commentary to the 2007 DVD release, Malcolm McDowell confirmed that lighting the chapel scenes for colour filming would have taken much longer than for black and white. The time they could use the school chapel was limited, so Anderson opted to not shoot those scenes in colour. Liking the effect this gave, he then decided to shoot other sequences in black and white to improve the &#x27;texture&#x27; of the film. As a child, he was impressed watching a gangster film which started in black and white and then turned to colour.

===Post-production===
The black-and-white sequence featuring Mrs Kemp (Mary MacLeod) walking naked through the school was allowed by the then Secretary of the Board of the [[British Board of Film Censors]], [[John Trevelyan (censor)|John Trevelyan]], on the condition that shots of male genitalia from the shower scene were removed.

Music featured in the film includes the &#x27;Sanctus&#x27;, from the [[Missa Luba]], a rendering of the Roman Latin mass sung to African beat by a Congolese choir.

==Release==
The film closed the [[London Film Festival]] on 5 December 1968 before opening in London later that month.
==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]&quot; wrote: &quot;A modern classic in which Anderson minutely captures both the particular ethos of a public school and the general flavour of any structured community, thus achieving a clear allegorical force without sacrificing a whit of his exploration of an essentially British institution. The impeccable logic of the conclusion is in no way diminished by having been lifted from [[Jean Vigo|Vigo]]&#x27;s &quot;[[Zero for Conduct|Zéro de Conduite]]&quot; [1933], made thirty-five years earlier. &quot;If...&quot; was also a timely film – shooting began two months before the events of May 1968 in Paris. Along with &quot;[[The White Bus]]&quot; [1967], it put Anderson into a pretty high league.&quot;

&quot;[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]&quot; wrote: &quot;Timely and timeless, this is a punchy, poetic pic that delves into the epic theme of youthful revolt. ...The script has the expert blend of heightened reality and lyricism enforced by the brilliant direction and the playing of a cast of unknowns.&quot;

&quot;The [[Radio Times]] Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;With its surrealistic elements, it was something of a departure for &quot;[[This Sporting Life]]&quot; [1963] director Lindsay Anderson, but he succeeds in both capturing the atmosphere and absurdities of public school life and investing the satire with plenty of venom. Malcolm McDowell gives a blistering performance in what is a key film in British cinema history.&quot;

[[Leslie Halliwell]], dissenting from the general praise for the film, wrote that &quot;Allegorical treatment of school life with much fashionable emphasis on obscure narrative, clever cutting, variety of pace, even an unaccountable changing from colour to monochrome and vice versa. Intelligence is clearly at work, but it seems to have suffered from undigested gobs of [[Harold Pinter|Pinter]], and the film as a whole makes no discernible point.&quot;

On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds a 90% approval rating based on 49 reviews, with an average score of 7.9/10. According to the site&#x27;s critical consensus, &quot;Incendiary, subversive, and darkly humorous, &quot;If...&quot; is a landmark of British countercultural cinema.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;If...&quot; won the [[Palme d&#x27;Or#Grand Prix du Festival International du Film (1964–1974)|Palme d&#x27;Or]] at the [[1969 Cannes Film Festival]]. In 1999, the [[British Film Institute]] named it the [[BFI Top 100 British films|12th greatest British film of the 20th century]]; in 2004, the magazine &quot;[[Total Film]]&quot; named it the 16th greatest British film of all time. In 2017 a poll of 150 actors, directors, writers, producers and critics for &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it the 9th best British film ever.

===McDowell&#x27;s casting in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;===
McDowell&#x27;s performance in &quot;If...&quot; caught the attention of [[Stanley Kubrick]], who subsequently cast him in his 1971 film adaptation of [[Anthony Burgess]]&#x27;s &quot;[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]&quot;. McDowell used his performance in &quot;If...&quot; in his inspiration for the &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; protagonist, Alexander DeLarge. Having been given the script by Kubrick, McDowell was unsure how he should play the part of Alex, and so he contacted Lindsay Anderson, asking for advice. McDowell relates the story:

Anyway, he said &#x27;Malcolm, this is how you play the part: there is a scene of you, a close-up in &quot;If...&quot;, where you open the doors to the gymnasium, to be beaten. You get a close-up.&#x27; I said &#x27;that&#x27;s right.&#x27; He said &#x27;do you remember...&#x27; I said &#x27;yes. I smiled.&#x27; He said &#x27;that&#x27;s right. You gave them that smile. That sort of ironic smile,&#x27; he said &#x27;and that&#x27;s how you play Alex.&#x27; And I went &#x27;my god, that&#x27;s brilliant. That&#x27;s brilliant.&#x27; That&#x27;s all I needed and that was enough, and that is a brilliant piece of direction for an actor.

== Sequels ==
&quot;If...&quot; is the first film in the &quot;[[Mick Travis]] trilogy&quot;, all starring Malcolm McDowell as everyman character Mick Travis. The others are:
* &quot;[[O Lucky Man!]]&quot; (1973)
* &quot;[[Britannia Hospital]]&quot; (1982)
Those two movies do not follow the same continuity of the first film, and have little in common other than the main character of Mick Travis and several identically named characters in similar roles (on the commentary track for &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot;, Malcolm McDowell refers to it as a &quot;so-called trilogy&quot;). At the time of Anderson&#x27;s death he had completed a final draft of a proper sequel to &quot;If...&quot;, but it was never made. The sequel takes place during a Founders&#x27; Day celebration at which many of the characters reunite. Mick Travis is now an Oscar-nominated movie star, eschewing England for Hollywood. Wallace is a military major who has lost his arm, Johnny is a clergyman, and Rowntree is the Minister of War. In the script, Rowntree is kidnapped by a group of anti-war students and saved by Mick and his gang, though not before Mick crucifies Rowntree with a large nail through his palm.

<text>iBiquity Digital Corporation was a company formed by the merger of USA Digital Radio and Lucent Digital Radio. Based in Columbia, Maryland, with additional offices in Basking Ridge, New Jersey, Los Angeles, California, and Auburn Hills, Michigan, iBiquity was a privately held intellectual properties company with investors in the technology, broadcasting, manufacturing, media, and financial industries.

== About ==
IBOC can operate on both AM band and FM band broadcasts either in a digital-only mode or in a &quot;hybrid&quot; digital+analog mode. The stations can split the digital bandwidth to carry multiple audio program streams (called HD2 or HD3 multicast channels) as well as show on-screen text data such as song title and artist, traffic, and weather information. Nearly 2,000 stations in the US broadcast with this system. The technology is marketed under the trademark HD Radio. It is the only technology approved by the Federal Communications Commission for digital AM and FM broadcasting in the United States. Due in large part to its ability to deliver digital audio services while leveraging the existing analog spectrum (by broadcasting digital information on the sidebands), commercial implementation of the technology is gaining momentum in various countries on one side of the world, including Canada, Mexico, and the Philippines. Testing and showing the system are underway in China, Colombia, Germany, Indonesia, Jamaica, New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, Thailand, and Ukraine, among other countries. According to iBiquity Digital, holder of the HD Radio trademark the &quot;HD&quot; in &quot;HD Radio&quot; does not stand for &quot;High Definition&quot; or &quot;Hybrid Digital&quot;. It is simply part of their trademark, and does not have any meaning on its own. On September 2, 2015, iBiquity announced that DTS was purchasing them for $172 million USD, bringing the HD Radio technology under the same banner as DTS&#x27; eponymous theater surround sound systems.

<text>Brownell Talbot College Preparatory School is an independent, co-educational, college preparatory day school located in Omaha, Nebraska, United States. It serves students from preschool through grade 12.

== History ==
In the mid-19th century, Omaha joined progressive cities that were establishing schools for girls&#x27; education. The Episcopal Church founded Brownell Hall, an all-girls secondary boarding school three miles north of Omaha in Saratoga. It officially opened on September 17, 1863. Located at present-day 400 North Happy Hollow, this private religious school was named after an Episcopal bishop of Connecticut, and was first located in the Saratoga Springs Hotel, a defunct resort. Students came to the school from Nebraska City, Bellevue, Florence, Fontanelle, Decatur and Omaha. The school moved to 16th and Jones in 1867, and in 1883 to 10th Street in downtown Omaha. In 1923 it moved to a central Omaha location. It became co-educational in 1963, ending 100 years of boarding girls. In 1968, the school became independent, breaking its ties with the Episcopal Church. Today it is the oldest school in continuous operation in Nebraska.

<doc id="612857" wikidata="Q423208" url="?curid=612857" title="Private school">
<text>A private school is a school not administered or funded by the government, unlike a public school. Private schools (also known as &#x27;independent schools&#x27;) are schools that are not dependent upon national or local government to finance their financial endowment. Unless privately owned they typically have a board of governors and have a system of governance that ensures their independent operation.

Private schools retain the right to select their students and are funded in whole or in part by charging their students for tuition, rather than relying on taxation through public (government) funding; at some private schools students may be eligible for a scholarship, lowering this tuition fee, dependent on a student&#x27;s talents or abilities (e.g., sports scholarship, art scholarship, academic scholarship), need for financial aid, or tax credit scholarships that might be available. Roughly one in 10 U.S. families have chosen to enroll their children in private school for the past century.

Some private schools are associated with a particular religious denomination or religion, such as Roman Catholicism, various branches of Protestantism or Judaism. Although private schools may have a religious affiliation, the precise use of the term excludes parochial (and other) schools if there is a financial dependence upon, or governance subordinate to, outside (religious) organizations. These definitions generally apply equally to both primary and secondary education.

==Types==
In the United Kingdom and several other Commonwealth countries including Australia, Canada and New Zealand the use of the term is generally restricted to primary and secondary educational levels, and it is almost never used of universities or other tertiary institutions. Private education in North America covers the whole gamut of educational activity, ranging from pre-school to tertiary level institutions. Annual tuition fees at K–12 schools range from nothing at so called &#x27;tuition-free&#x27; schools to more than $45,000 at several New England University-preparatory schools.

The secondary level includes university-preparatory schools, boarding schools, and day schools. Tuition at private secondary schools varies from school to school and depends on many factors, including the school&#x27;s location, the willingness of parents to pay, peer tuitions, and the school&#x27;s financial endowment. Some private schools are boarding schools, and many military academies are privately owned or operated as well.

Religiously affiliated and denominational schools form a subcategory of private schools. Some such schools teach religious education, together with the usual academic subjects, to impress their particular faith&#x27;s beliefs and traditions in the students who attend. Others use the denomination as a general label to describe what the founders based their belief, while still maintaining a fine distinction between academics and religion. They include parochial schools, a term which is often used to denote Roman Catholic schools. Other religious groups represented in the K–12 private education sector include Protestants, Jews, Muslims, and Orthodox Christians.

Many educational alternatives, such as private schools or online schools, are privately financed. Private schools often avoid some state regulations, although in the name of educational quality, most comply with regulations relating to the educational content of classes. Religious private schools often add religious instruction to the courses provided by local public schools.

Special assistance schools aim to improve the lives of their students by providing services tailored to the particular needs of individual students. Such schools include tutoring schools and schools to assist the learning of disabled children.

==By country==
===Australia===
In Australia, private schools are mostly operated by an independently elected school council or board of governors and range broadly in the type of school-education provided and the socio-economics of the school community served. Most private schools are run by religious institutes while others have no religious affiliation and are driven by a national philosophy (such as international schools), pedogogical philosophy (such as Waldorf-Steiner schools), or specific needs (such as special schools).

Australia has one of the most privatised education systems in the world with 30 per cent of primary students and more than 40 per cent of secondary students attending private schools. In contrast the OECD average is 18 per cent. Catholic schools make up a sizeable proportion of total enrolment (nearly 15%) and are usually regarded as a school sector of their own within the broad category of private schools, often charging lower fees than Protestant private schools. Enrolment in non-government schools have been growing steadily at the expense of enrolments in government schools, which have seen their enrolment share reduce from 78.1 percent to 65 percent since 1970, although the rate of growth of private schools has slowed in the later years.

Australian private schools differ from those in other OECD nations as the Australian Government provides funding to all schools including private schools. In 2013, after release of the (first) Gonski Report, the funding formula was changed to compute individual school funding compared to a School Resourcing Standard (SRS). The SRS uses exam results from the National Assessment Program – Literacy and Numeracy tests, calculates the SRS from a cohort of well-performing schools, and applies this formula to other schools on the assumption that they should be able to achieve similar results from similar funding. The funding provided to private schools is on a sliding scale and still has a &quot;capacity to pay&quot; element; however, on average, funding granted to the private school sector is 40 percent of that required to operate government schools, the remainder being made up by tuition fees and donations from parents. The majority of the funding comes from the Commonwealth Government, while the state and territory governments provide about one-third of the Commonwealth amount. The Turnbull government commissioned Gonski in 2017 to chair the independent Review to Achieve Educational Excellence in Australian Schools, commonly called Gonski 2.0. The government published the report on 30 April 2018. 

Following negotiation, bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth of Australia with each state and territory commenced on 1 January 2019, with the exception of Victoria, whose bilateral agreement commenced on 1 February 2019. The funding agreements provide states with funding for government schools (20 percent) and non-government schools (80 percent) taking into consideration annual changes in enrolment numbers, indexation and student or school characteristics. A National School Resourcing Board was charged with the responsibility of independently reviewing each state&#x27;s compliance with the funding agreement(s).

Private school fees can vary from under $100 per month to $2,000 and upwards, depending on the student&#x27;s year level, the school&#x27;s size, and the socio-economics of the school community. In late 2018 it was reported the most expensive private schools (such as AAGPS and CAS schools in New South Wales, GPS and QGSSSA schools in Queensland, AGSV and APS schools in Victoria) charge fees of up to $500,000 for thirteen years of education. The oldest private school in Australia is The King’s School, founded in 1831.

Catholic schools form the second-largest sector after government schools, with around 21% of secondary enrolments. Catholic schools, typically have a strong religious focus and usually most of the staff and students are Catholic.

===Canada===

In 1999, 5.6% of Canadian students were enrolled in private schools, some of which are religious or faith-based schools, including Christian, Jewish, and Islamic schools. Some private schools in Canada are considered world-class, especially some boarding schools. Private schools have sometimes been controversial, with some in the media and in Ontario&#x27;s Provincial Ministry of Education asserting that students may buy inflated grades from private schools.

=== Finland ===

In Finland, education takes place in state-run, municipality-run, and private schools. To qualify for public funding, all schools must receive a license from the Ministry of Education and Culture and align with the national curriculum and educational standards. While education is generally free, schools that offer instruction in languages other than the official languages of Finland (for example in English) may charge modest fees. There are also unlicensed private schools that do not follow any national curriculum and do not receive public funding. Certificates obtained from such institutions are not recognized as valid proof of education. 

In 2018, private schools accounted for 3% of basic education institutions and 9% of upper secondary education institutions. All Universities of Applied Sciences are either privately owned or municipality-owned companies or foundations. Some private Universities in Finland operate without legal mandate and are not overseen by the Ministry of Education and Culture. Graduates from these universities must undergo the same verification process as those holding foreign degrees. 

===Germany===

The right to create private schools in Germany is in Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz and cannot be suspended even in a state of emergency. It is also not possible to abolish these rights. This unusual protection of private schools was implemented to protect these schools from a second Gleichschaltung or similar event in the future.

===Italy===

In Italy education is predominantly public; about one-fifth of schools are private, attended by about one out of 10 Italian schoolchildren. The Italian constitution states that education is to be public, free, and compulsory for at least eight years.

===India===

In India, private schools are called independent schools, but since some private schools receive financial aid from the government, it can be an aided or an unaided school. Demand for private schools has been growing over the years. While a consensus over what is the most significant driver of this growth in private schooling has not yet emerged, some authors have attributed this to a higher demand for English-medium education, a dissatisfaction with the quality of public schools, greater affordability of private schools, and non-availability of preferred field of study in government schools. After the adoption of the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, private schools were required to be &#x27;government-recognised&#x27;. A private school would be eligible for government recognition when it met certain conditions.

At the primary and secondary level, India has a large private school system complementing the government run schools, with 29% of students receiving private education in the 6 to 14 age group. Certain post-secondary technical schools are also private. The private education market in India had a revenue of US$450 million in 2008, but is projected to be a US$40 billion market. Although there are private schools in India, they are highly regulated in terms of what they can teach, in what form they can operate (must be a non-profit to run any accredited educational institution) and all the other aspects of the operation. Hence, the differentiation between government schools and private schools can be misleading. However, in a report by Geeta Gandhi Kingdon entitled: &quot;The Emptying of Public Schools and Growth of Private Schools in India&quot;, it is said that for sensible education-policy making, it is vital to take account of the various changing trends in the size of the private and public schooling sectors in India. Ignoring these trends involves the risk of poor policies/legislation, with adverse effects on children&#x27;s education.

===Iran===
A lot of criticism towards Iranian government is because of large gap of University entrance Exam success between public and private school students, number private school growth has seen a 15% growth dominating Iranian education sector. there is a rise of &quot;luxury&quot; schools. Studying for one year term in private schools may cost 50 million as of July 2023.

===Ireland===

In Ireland, the internationally recognised definition of &quot;private school&quot; is misleading and a more accurate distinction is between fee-charging schools and non-fee-charging schools. This is because approximately 85% of all schools are private schools () by virtue of not being owned by the state. The Roman Catholic Church is the largest owner of schools in Ireland, with other religious institutions owning the remaining private schools. Nevertheless, despite the vast majority of schools being under the ownership of private institutions, a large majority of all their costs, including teachers&#x27; salaries, are paid for by the Irish state. Of these private schools, only a very small minority actually charge fees. In 2007, &#x27;The number of schools permitted to charge fees represents 7.6% of the 723 post primary level schools and they cater for 7.1% of the total enrolment.&#x27; 
If a fee-charging school wishes to employ extra teachers they are paid for with school fees, which tend to be relatively low in Ireland compared to the rest of the world. Because state funding plays a fundamental role in the finances of all but one fee-charging school, they must undergo similar state inspection to non-fee-charging schools. This is due to the requirement that the state ensure that children receive a certain minimum education; Irish state subsidised fee-charging schools must still work towards the Junior Certificate and the Leaving Certificate, for example.

The single fee-charging secondary school in Ireland which receives no state funding, the Nord Anglia International School Dublin, does not have to undergo the state supervision which all the other fee-charging schools undergo. Students there also sit the International Baccalaureate rather than the Irish Leaving Certificate which every other Irish secondary school student sits. In exchange, however, Nord Anglia students pay some €25,000 per annum in fees, compared to c. €4,000 – €8,000 per annum fees by students in all other fee-charging Irish schools.
Many fee-charging schools in Ireland also double as boarding schools. The fees for these may then rise up to €25,000 per year. All the state-subsidised fee-charging schools are run by a religious order, e.g., the Society of Jesus or Congregation of Christian Brothers, etc. The major private schools being Blackrock College, Clongowes Wood College, Castleknock College, Belvedere College, Gonzaga College and Terenure College. There are also a few fee-charging international schools in Ireland, including a French school, a Japanese school and a German school.

=== Japan ===
===Malaysia===

Chinese schools were being founded by the ethnic Chinese in Malaysia as early as the 19th century. They provide secondary education in the Chinese language as the continuation of the primary education in Chinese national-type primary schools. The main medium of instruction in these schools is Mandarin Chinese using simplified Chinese characters.

Being private schools, Chinese independent high schools do not receive consistent funding from the Malaysian government, although they did receive some funding from some state governments as well as in the 2019 and 2020 budgets under the Pakatan Harapan government. However, in accordance with their aim of providing affordable education to all in the Chinese language, their school fees are substantially lower than those of most other private schools. The schools are kept alive almost exclusively by donations from the public.

===Netherlands===

In the Netherlands over two-thirds of state-funded schools operate autonomously, with many of these schools being linked to faith groups. The Programme for International Student Assessment, coordinated by the OECD, ranks the education in the Netherlands as the 9th best in the world as of 2008, being significantly higher than the OECD average.

===New Zealand===

As of April 2014, there were 88 private schools in New Zealand, catering for around 28,000 students or 3.7% of the entire student population. Private school numbers have been in decline since the mid-1970s as a result of many private schools opting to become state-integrated schools, mostly due to financial difficulties stemming from changes in student numbers or the economy. State-integrated schools keep their private school special character and receives state funds in return for having to operate like a state school, e.g. they must teach the state curriculum, they must employ registered teachers, and they can not charge tuition fees (they can charge &quot;attendance dues&quot; for the upkeep on the still-private school land and buildings). The largest decline in private school numbers occurred between 1979 and 1984, when the nation&#x27;s then-private Catholic school system integrated. As a result, private schools in New Zealand are now largely restricted to the largest cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington and Christchurch) and niche markets.

Private schools are almost fully funded by tuition fees paid by students&#x27; parents, but they do receive some government subsidies. Private schools are popular for academic and sporting performance, prestige, exclusivity and old boys/girls networks; however, many state-integrated schools and some prestigious single-sex state schools, such as Auckland Grammar School and Wellington College, are actively competitive with private schools in academic and sporting achievement, history and character.

Private schools are often Anglican, such as King&#x27;s College and Diocesan School for Girls in Auckland, St Paul&#x27;s Collegiate School in Hamilton, St Peter&#x27;s School in Cambridge, Samuel Marsden Collegiate School in Wellington, and Christ&#x27;s College and St Margaret&#x27;s College in Christchurch; or Presbyterian, such as Saint Kentigern College and St Cuthbert&#x27;s College in Auckland, Scots College and Queen Margaret College in Wellington, and St Andrew&#x27;s College and Rangi Ruru Girls&#x27; School in Christchurch. However, the Catholic schismatic group, the Society of St Pius X in Wanganui operates three private schools (including the secondary school, St Dominic&#x27;s College). A recent group of private schools run as a business has been formed by Academic Colleges Group; with schools throughout Auckland, including ACG Senior College in Auckland&#x27;s CBD, ACG Parnell College in Parnell, and international school ACG New Zealand International College.

===Philippines===

In the Philippines, the private sector has been a major provider of educational services. Private schools are generally free to determine their curriculum in accordance with existing laws and regulations. Science high schools are special schools for the more intellectually promising students to foster the problem-solving approach of critical thinking. As separate high schools, they have specific characteristics not found in regular high schools. However, any private or public high school can aspire to meet these minimum standards and be considered a science high school.

The Fund for Assistance to Private Education (FAPE) is a perpetual trust fund for private education created by Executive Order № 156 1968 and amended by Executive Order № 150 1994. FAPE was created on November 5, 1968 by Executive Order No. 156, in implementation of the project agreement between the Philippine and United States governments to establish a permanent trust fund that would address the needs of the private education sector in the country.

===Portugal===

In Portugal, private schools were traditionally set up by foreign expatriates and diplomats in order to cater for their educational needs. Portuguese-speaking private schools are widespread across Portugal&#x27;s main cities. International private schools are mainly concentrated in and around Lisbon, Porto, Braga, Coimbra and Covilhã, across the Portuguese region of Algarve, and in the autonomous region of Madeira. The Ministério da Educação acts as the supervisory and regulatory body for all schools, including international schools.

===Singapore===

In Singapore, after Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), students can choose to enter a private high school. Private tuition is a lucrative industry in Singapore, since many parents send their children for private tuition after school. A straw poll by &quot;The Straits Times&quot; newspaper in 2008 found that out of 100 students interviewed, only 3 students did not have any form of tuition. In 2010, the &quot;Shin Min Daily News&quot; estimated that there were around 540 tuition centres offering private tuition in Singapore. Due to their high demand, tuition centres are able to charge high fees for their services; they have an annual turnover of SGD$110.6 million in 2005. The official government stance on private tuition is that &quot;it understands parents want the best for their children and that it is their decision whether to engage tutors&quot;.

=== South Africa ===

Some of the oldest schools in South Africa are private church schools that were established by missionaries in the early nineteenth century. The private sector has grown ever since. After the abolition of apartheid, the laws governing private education in South Africa changed significantly. The South African Schools Act of 1996 recognizes two categories of schools: &quot;public&quot; (state-controlled) and &quot;independent&quot; (which includes traditional private schools and schools which are privately governed).

In the final years of the apartheid era, parents at white government schools were given the option to convert to a &quot;semi-private&quot; form called &quot;Model C&quot;, and many of these schools changed their admissions policies to accept children classified to be of other races. These schools tend to produce better academic results than government schools formerly reserved for other &quot;race groups&quot;. Former &quot;Model C&quot; schools are state-controlled, not private. All schools in South Africa (including both independent and public schools) have the right to set compulsory school fees, and formerly model C schools tend to set much higher school fees than other public schools.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, pupils are free to choose a private school and the private school gets paid the same amount as municipal schools. Over 10% of Swedish pupils were enrolled in private schools in 2008. Sweden is internationally known for this innovative school voucher model that provides Swedish pupils with the opportunity to choose the school they prefer. For instance, the biggest school chain, Kunskapsskolan (&quot;The Knowledge School&quot;), offers 30 schools and a web-based environment, has 700 employees and teaches nearly 10,000 pupils.

===United Kingdom===

In the UK, the term &quot;private schools&quot; encompasses schools that are independently funded and not part of the state system. These schools are known as independent schools. Within this category, &quot;public schools&quot; refer to a specific group of prestigious, often older, independent schools. Preparatory schools in England and Wales prepare pupils up to 13 years old to enter public schools. In Scotland, where the education system has always been separate from the rest of Great Britain, the term &#x27;public school&#x27; was used historically to refer to state schools for the general public. 

According to &quot;The Good Schools Guide&quot; about 7% of children being educated in the United Kingdom are at fee-charging schools at GCSE level and 13% at A-level. Some independent schools are single-sex, although this is becoming less common. In 2011, fees range from under £3,000 to £21,000 and above per year for day pupils, rising to over £27,000 per year for boarders. Costs differ in Scotland.

One in four independently educated children come from postcodes with the national average income or below, and one in three receive assistance with school fees. Evidence from a major longitudinal study suggests that British independent schools provide advantages in educational attainment and access to top universities.

====England and Wales====
In England and Wales, the more prestigious independent schools are known as &#x27;public schools&#x27;, sometimes subdivided into major and minor public schools. A modern definition of a public school refers to membership of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference, and this includes many independent grammar schools. The term &#x27;public school&#x27; historically meant that the school was open to the public (as opposed to private tutors or the school being in private ownership). Many private schools actively compete with prestigious state schools (including state grammar schools and single sex schools) in academic achievements.

There are many old, world-renowned institutions in England that served as inspiration for most schools of their type abroad. These schools include Winchester College, Eton College, St Paul&#x27;s School, Harrow School, Westminster School, and Rugby School. The Independent Schools Inspectorate regularly publishes reports on the quality of education in all independent schools.

====Scotland====
In Scotland, schools not state-funded are known as independent or private schools. Independent schools may also be specialist or special schools – such as some music schools, Steiner Waldorf Education schools, or special education schools.

Scottish independent schools currently educate over 31,000 students and employ approximately 3,500 teachers. Schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS). All schools are still inspected by the state inspectorate, Education Scotland, and the Care Inspectorate. Independent schools in Scotland that are charities are subject to a specific test from the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator, designed to demonstrate the public benefit the schools provide.

===United States===

In the United States, a private school is any for which the facilities and funding are not provided by the federal, state or local government, or in the case of charter schools, independently with government funding and regulation (as opposed to a public school, which is operated by the government). A majority of private schools in the United States are operated by religious institutions and organizations. In practice, the term &quot;private school&quot; is commonly used to denote a non-sectarian school, whereas &quot;church school&quot;, &quot;Christian school&quot;, and (for Catholic institutions) &quot;parochial school&quot; are used to denote sectarian ones.

Independent schools in the United States educate around 10% of the entire school-age population. 

The essential distinction between independent schools and other private schools is self-governance and financial independence. In contrast, public schools are funded and governed by local and state governments, and most parochial schools are owned, governed, and financed by religious institutions such as a diocese or parish. Independent schools may be affiliated with a particular religion or denomination; however, unlike parochial schools, independent schools are self-owned and governed by independent boards of trustees. While independent schools are not subject to significant government oversight or regulation, they are accredited by the same six regional accreditation agencies that accredit public schools. The National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) is a membership organization of American pre-college independent schools.

The NAIS provides this definition of an independent school:

Independent schools are 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporate entities, independent in governance and finance, meaning:
#Independent schools &quot;own themselves&quot; (as opposed to public schools owned by the government or parochial schools owned by the church) and govern themselves, typically with a self-perpetuating board of trustees that performs fiduciary duties of oversight and strategic duties of funding and setting the direction and vision of the enterprise, and by delegating day to day operations entirely to the head of school.
#Independent schools finance themselves (as opposed to public schools funded through the government and parochial schools subsidized by the church), largely through charging tuition, fund raising, and income from endowment.

Independence is the unique characteristic of this segment of the education industry, offering schools four freedoms that contribute to their success: the freedom to define their own unique missions; the freedom to admit and keep only those students well-matched to the mission; the freedom to define the qualifications for high quality teachers; and the freedom to determine on their own what to teach and how to assess student achievement and progress.
In the United States, the membership organization for independent tertiary education institutions is the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities. Private schools are generally exempt from most educational regulations at the Federal level but are highly regulated at the state level. These typically require them to follow the spirit of regulations concerning the content of courses in an attempt to provide a level of education equal to or better than that available in public schools.

In the nineteenth century, as a response to the perceived domination of the public school systems by Protestant political and religious ideas, many Roman Catholic parish churches, dioceses and religious orders established schools, which operate entirely without government funding. For many years, the vast majority of private schools in the United States were Catholic schools.

In many parts of the United States, after the 1954 decision in the landmark court case &quot;Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka&quot; that demanded United States schools desegregate &quot;with all deliberate speed&quot;, local families organized a wave of private &quot;Christian academies&quot;. In much of the U.S. South, many white students migrated to the academies, while public schools became in turn more heavily concentrated with African-American students (see List of private schools in Mississippi). The academic content of the academies was usually college preparatory. 

Funding for private schools is generally provided through student tuition, endowments, scholarship/school voucher funds, and donations and grants from religious organizations or private individuals. Government funding for religious schools is either subject to restrictions or possibly forbidden, according to the courts&#x27; interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment or individual state Blaine Amendments. Non-religious private schools theoretically could qualify for such funding without hassle, preferring the advantages of independent control of their student admissions and course content instead of the public funding they could get with charter status. A similar concept, recently emerging from within the public school system, is the concept of charter schools, which are officially independent public schools, but in many respects operate similarly to nonreligious private schools.

The nature of private schooling in the United States has been debated by educators, lawmakers and parents, since the beginnings of compulsory education in Massachusetts in 1852. One of the most common topics of debate is whether or not the ability to select a private institution takes funding away from public schools. Many states base their funding off of how many students a school has but will also offer voucher programs. These programs and similar incentives exist to incentivize school choice and take stress off of state educational funding. However, it is also believed that taking students and funding out of public schools decreases the quality of these institutions. Still even with this, the Supreme Court precedent appears to favor educational choice, so long as states may set standards for educational accomplishment. Some of the most relevant Supreme Court case law on this is as follows: &quot;Runyon v. McCrary&quot;, 427 U.S. 160 (1976); &quot;Wisconsin v. Yoder&quot;, 406 U.S. 205 (1972); &quot;Pierce v. Society of Sisters&quot;, 268 U.S. 510 (1925); &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;, 262 U.S. 390 (1923). There is a potential conflict between the values espoused in the above cited cases and the limitations set forward in Article 29 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is below described. 

Quality private schools in the United States charge substantial tuition: in 2023, tuition cost close to $60,000 annually for some day schools in New York City, and between $65,000 and $85,000 for boarding schools. Nevertheless, tuition may not be sufficient to cover operating expenses, particularly at boarding schools. Leading schools such as the Groton School, Phillips Academy, and Phillips Exeter Academy have substantial endowments - running to over a billion dollars - supplemented by fundraising drives. Boarding schools with a reputation for quality in the United States have a student body drawn from throughout the United States, and in some cases other countries, and a list of applicants which far exceeds their capacity.

<text>Bridgewater is a northern suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, Australia, 19 kilometres from the central business district.

==Overview==

Bridgewater is situated on the eastern shore of the Derwent River. It is a suburb of the local government area of the Municipality of Brighton. From a transport perspective, Bridgewater is one of the first suburbs encountered by visitors traveling from the state&#x27;s north via the Midland Highway and the Brighton Bypass. The suburb connects to the western shore via the Bridgewater Bridge. Bridgewater was also once home to the railway station on the South line, which was used by commuters for travel into the city. It was demolished in April 1997.

==Culture==
Bridgewater commonly has a reputation for its low social class and is noted as a disadvantaged area. Much of this is due to the mass of public housing, mainly built in the 1970s as part of a public housing project that was operating from 1944 to 1989.
It also has one of the highest proportions of cigarette smokers in Australia.

==Education==
Bridgewater has three primary schools: Northern Suburbs Christian School (private), St. Paul&#x27;s Primary School (Catholic), and East Derwent Primary School (public). It also has a public high school, Bridgewater High School, which includes a school farm. East Derwent Primary School is a merger of the old Greenpoint and Bridgewater Primary Schools and is on the site of the former Greenpoint school.

The Government of Tasmania, through the Big Picture School initiative, has connected the public schools of the area together into what will be known as the &quot;Jordan River Learning Federation&quot;, which will provide the area with K–12 public school education, through the East Derwent Primary School, Bridgewater High School, and the newly developed post year 10 education institute.

==Sport and recreation==
Since 2011 Bridgewater has been the home to soccer club Derwent United FC at Weily Park.

<text>Secrets &amp; Lies is a 1996 comedy-drama film written and directed by Mike Leigh. Led by an ensemble cast consisting of many Leigh regulars, it focuses on a dysfunctional family whose relations are thrown into further chaos after Cynthia (Brenda Blethyn) is contacted by her adult daughter Hortense (Marianne Jean-Baptiste), who was put up for adoption at birth and wishes to connect with her birth mother. Timothy Spall, Phyllis Logan, and Claire Rushbrook co-star as other members of the family.

The film premiered on 10 May 1996 at the Cannes Film Festival, where it won both the Palme d&#x27;Or and the Best Actress Award (Blethyn). Upon its release, it received critical acclaim for its performances and emotional weight, and grossed $33-50 million at the box office, against a budget of $4.5 million. At the 69th Academy Awards, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; was nominated in five categories: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Actress (Blethyn), and Best Supporting Actress (Jean-Baptiste). It also received three nominations at the 54th Golden Globe Awards, winning Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama (Blethyn), and seven nominations at the 50th British Academy Film Awards, winning Outstanding British Film, Best Original Screenplay and Best Actress in a Leading Role (Blethyn).

==Plot==
Hortense Cumberbatch, a Black optometrist in London, embarks on a journey to trace her family history following the death of her adoptive mother. Despite warnings about potential challenges, she discovers her birth mother is Cynthia Purley, a white woman working in a cardboard box factory in East London. Cynthia lives with her daughter Roxanne, a street sweeper, and tensions arise in their strained relationship. Cynthia&#x27;s brother Maurice, a successful photographer, lives in the suburbs with his wife Monica, who struggles with depression over her inability to have children.

Cynthia and Monica share a mutual dislike, with Monica viewing Cynthia as self-pitying and hysterical, while Cynthia sees Monica as greedy and snobbish. Maurice, caught in the middle, rarely visits Cynthia and Roxanne. However, they all anticipate celebrating Roxanne&#x27;s 21st birthday. Maurice&#x27;s surprise visit to Cynthia prompts an emotional breakdown, and he gives her money for house repairs, expressing a desire to host a barbecue for Roxanne&#x27;s birthday.

Roxanne, unknown to Cynthia, has a boyfriend named Paul, leading to a heated argument between mother and daughter. Hortense, determined to connect with her birth mother, contacts Cynthia and eventually persuades her to meet. In a face-to-face meeting, Cynthia, unprepared for Hortense&#x27;s race, denies her identity until confronted with birth documents. Cynthia, overwhelmed with shame, slowly accepts the truth, and the two begin bonding.

As Cynthia and Hortense develop a friendship, Roxanne notices her mother&#x27;s newfound secrecy. Cynthia, planning to bring Hortense to Roxanne&#x27;s birthday party, asks Maurice if she can bring a colleague from work. Despite reservations, Hortense agrees to attend and pose as Cynthia&#x27;s friend. The party becomes tense, with passive-aggressive exchanges between Cynthia, Monica, and other guests.

In a moment of nervousness, Cynthia reveals to Roxanne that Hortense is her daughter, leading to disbelief and anger. Maurice intervenes, convincing Roxanne to listen, while Cynthia and Monica quarrel. Cynthia berates Monica and Maurice defends her, disclosing her infertility, and urges everyone to share their pain rather than harbour resentments.

Monica breaks down, Cynthia comforts her, and the two women reconcile with a hug. Cynthia reveals Roxanne&#x27;s father was an American medical student who disappeared after a vacation encounter. When asked about Hortense&#x27;s father, Cynthia cryptically replies, &quot;Don&#x27;t break my heart, darling,&quot; and then breaks down cryingm and Monica and Hortense comfort her. After the party, Monica expresses her love for Maurice, and Hortense visits Cynthia and Roxanne, expressing her desire for a sister. Roxanne, despite the complexities, welcomes Hortense as her half-sister.

==Cast==
Many Leigh regulars make cameo appearances in the film, most of whom serve as clients of Maurice&#x27;s photography business. They include: Peter Wight as the father in a family group, Gary McDonald as a boxer, Alison Steadman (Leigh&#x27;s wife at the time) as a dog owner, Liz Smith as a cat owner, Sheila Kelley as a fertile mother, Phil Davis as a man in a suit, Anthony O&#x27;Donnell as an uneasy man, Ruth Sheen as a laughing woman, and musician Mia Soteriou as a fiancée.

==Production==
Leigh was inspired to make a film about adoption by &quot;people close to [him] who have had adoption-related experiences.&quot; Speaking on the subject, he stated: &quot;I wanted for years to make a film which explored this predicament in a fictitious way. I also wanted to make a film about the new generation of young black people who are moving on and getting away from the ghetto stereotypes. And these were jumping off points for a film which turns out to be an exploration of roots and identity.&quot;

As with all of Leigh&#x27;s films, the performances were created through months of intensive improvisation, during which Leigh worked with the actors, individually and together, to create their characters. The emotional scene in the cafe, in which Cynthia realises she is indeed Hortense&#x27;s mother, was filmed in a single uninterrupted take of just over seven minutes. It had been a common misunderstanding that Brenda Blethyn was not told before filming that Hortense was black, making her reaction in the scene more authentic, but, in a supplement on the March 2021 Criterion Collection release of the film, Leigh, in conversation with Gary Yershon, clarified that, while Blethyn did not know Marianne Jean-Baptiste would be playing her daughter when they first improvised the scene, this took place during pre-production.

The film was partly shot in Whitehouse Way, Southgate, London. Principal photography began on 29 May 1995 and finished on 12 August.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; grossed £1.7 million ($2.8 million) in the United Kingdom, $8.9 million in France, and $13.4 million in the United States and Canada. It grossed $29 million in other international markets, for a worldwide gross of $33–50 million.

===Critical reception===

The film was released to critical acclaim. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 96% of 45 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;&quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; delves into social issues with delicate aplomb and across-the-board incredible acting, and stands as one of writer-director Mike Leigh&#x27;s most powerful works.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars, writing that &quot;moment after moment, scene after scene, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; unfolds with the fascination of eavesdropping&quot;, and adding that Leigh &quot;finds a rhythm of life – not &#x27;real life,&#x27; but real life as fashioned and shaped by all the art and skill his actors can bring to it – and slips into it, so that we are not particularly aware we&#x27;re watching a film&quot;. He called the film &quot;a flowering of [Leigh&#x27;s] technique. It moves us on a human level, it keeps us guessing during scenes as unpredictable as life, and it shows us how ordinary people have a chance of somehow coping with their problems, which are rather ordinary, too.&quot; In 2009, Ebert added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; collection.

Edward Guthmann of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; called the film Leigh&#x27;s &quot;best and most accessible work to date&quot;, and remarked that &quot;everyone&#x27;s had these family skirmishes and confrontations in their lives, and it&#x27;s remarkable to see them recorded so accurately and painfully on film. Leigh&#x27;s marvelous achievement is not only in capturing emotional clarity on film, but also in illustrating the ways in which families start to heal and find a certain bravery in their efforts&quot;. Similarly, Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; ranked the film among the best of the 14 features Leigh had written and directed by then, finding it &quot;a piercingly honest, completely accessible piece of work that will go directly to the hearts of audiences who have never heard of him. If film means anything to you, if emotional truth is a quality you care about, this is an event that ought not be missed [...] Unforced, confident and completely involving, with exceptional acting aided by Dick Pope&#x27;s unobtrusive camera work and John Gregory&#x27;s telling editing, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; is filmmaking to savor.&quot;

Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt the film incorporates all the &quot;elements of humor, sweetness, cruelty and directness&quot; of Leigh&#x27;s previous films, but is &quot;more emotional, tear-inducing and compassionate than its predecessors&quot;, and declared it &quot;an extended, multilayered revelation, and you don&#x27;t get the full, complex picture until the final scene&quot;. His colleague Rita Kempley called the film &quot;a magnificent melodrama that draws both tears and laughter from the everyday give-and-take of seemingly ordinary souls&quot;, and noted that &quot;Blethyn and Jean-Baptiste are a joy to behold in tandem, but Blethyn&#x27;s endearing portrait is transcendent.&quot;

In 1999, &quot;Secrets &amp; Lies&quot; was listed as the 40th-best British film of the 20th century on a list compiled by the British Film Institute.

===Accolades===
==Positive pickets==
This film was the subject of &quot;positive pickets&quot; by the adult adoptee rights organisation Bastard Nation, which used it as a vehicle to raise awareness of sealed birth records in the United States and Canada.

Director Leigh and actress Blethyn met with Bastard Nation activists at a positive picket in Beverly Hills on 10 March 1997, where they were presented with Bastard Nation T-shirts.

<doc id="612868" wikidata="Q5307157" url="?curid=612868" title="Drew Curtis">
<text>Drew Curtis (born February 7, 1973) is the founder and an administrator of Fark, an Internet news aggregator. He is also the author of &quot;It&#x27;s Not News, It&#x27;s FARK: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News&quot; in May 2007. He is a guest on WOCM&#x27;s morning show &quot;The Rude Awakening Show&quot; every Tuesday. Curtis was the Independent gubernatorial candidate for Governor of Kentucky in 2015 but lost to the Republican nominee Matt Bevin.

==Fark==
Fark began in 1993 when Curtis was in England, sending links back to his friends. Curtis registered Fark.com in 1997 but did not begin posting links on the site until 1999. The first story on Fark was a news article about a fighter pilot who crashed while attempting to expose his buttocks to another fighter pilot. Since then, the site has become one of the most popular link dump sites on the internet with nearly 50 million pageviews a month. As of 2006, the site was getting over 2,000 link submissions every day. It was the first indie blog to earn one million dollars a year in profit and its classifieds section alone generates as much as $40,000 per year.

Although Fark is a million-dollar business, Curtis takes a yearly salary of $60,000. The rest of the money goes to the site&#x27;s legal &#x27;war chest&#x27; and to pay other expenses.

Under Curtis, Fark has purposely shied away from the Web 2.0 mantra of total user control.
I don&#x27;t care what anyone says, the masses are morons. You can&#x27;t count on them to pick good stuff. Just check out Network TV to see what the masses want for entertainment. It all sucks. Don&#x27;t even get me started on how they vote for elected officials. There&#x27;s certainly a place for that kind of thing but it&#x27;s not on Fark.

According to Curtis, Web 3.0 will be &quot;something called Good Editing.&quot; Speaking at a media conference in Washington, DC hosted by the Poynter Institute, Curtis stated, &quot;The &#x27;wisdom of the crowds&#x27; is the most ridiculous statement I&#x27;ve heard in my life. Crowds are dumb. It takes people to move crowds in the right direction, crowds by themselves just stand around and mutter.&quot;

In 2006, Curtis was featured on the cover of &quot;Business 2.0&quot; magazine as the feature in a story about successful websites. &quot;Lexington Weekly&quot; named him one of their businessmen under 40 to watch.

On November 28, 2007, Curtis filed an application to trademark the phrase &quot;not safe for work&quot; a common phrase on Fark. His application was denied.

==&quot;It&#x27;s Not News, It&#x27;s FARK&quot;==
Curtis published his first book, &quot;It&#x27;s Not News, It&#x27;s FARK: How Mass Media Tries to Pass off Crap as News&quot; in May 2007. It soon became a bestseller. An in-depth analysis of the state of modern media, &quot;It&#x27;s Not News, It&#x27;s Fark&quot; slams news organizations for running smaller versions of his not-real-news. In his review of the book, Farhad Manjoo of Salon.com said that &quot;[Curtis] even seems to go after the audience – his audience – for indulging in [not-real-news] Curtis seems to want us to be repulsed by them instead.&quot;

Curtis&#x27;s book peaked at #12 on Amazon.com&#x27;s non-fiction bestseller list. Media critic Jack Shafer noted that despite the book&#x27;s success, it received &quot;scant attention&quot; from mainstream media outlets. The book was later released in paperback.

==Personal life==
Curtis graduated from Luther College in Decorah, Iowa in 1995. From 1996 to 2002, he owned and operated DCR.NET, an ISP based in Frankfort, Kentucky. He is a graduate of the Berkeley-Columbia Executive MBA program, a joint venture of New York&#x27;s Columbia University and the University of California at Berkeley. Curtis lives in the suburbs of Lexington, Kentucky with his wife, Heather, and children, Chance, Storm, and Sierra.

==Gubernatorial campaign==
Curtis announced his candidacy on January 23, 2015, for the 2015 election for the Governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. The platform revolved around a &quot;Citizen Candidate&quot; philosophy of common sense and data-driven decisions, no experiments, leaving people alone, having no party alignment, and taking special-interest money out of the political process. The stated hope was to build a blueprint for regular, real people in all 50 states/commonwealths to be able to create constructive disruptions in a broken system, in order to run competitively in elections. With his wife Heather as his running mate, Curtis faced the Republican Party nominee, businessman Matt Bevin, and the Democratic Party nominee, Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway, in the November 3 general election. In the election held on November 3, 2015, Curtis lost the election to Bevin, receiving 35,629 total votes, or 3.7%.

==State Auditor campaign==

In January 2019, Curtis filed to run as a Democrat for the post of State Auditor for Kentucky. Faced with a primary against three other Democrats, he withdrew on April 11, 2019, citing &quot;other commitments&quot;. Due to his late withdrawal, Curtis&#x27; name remained on the primary ballot, but votes in his favor were not counted. The primary was subsequently won by Democratic candidate Sheri Donahue, who lost by a 14.62% margin in the general election to incumbent Republican Mike Harmon.

<text>Action Half-Life is a mod for the first-person shooter video game &quot;Half-Life&quot;. It strives to simulate action movies, especially those directed by John Woo.

&quot;Action Half-Life&quot; is the second mod in the &quot;Action&quot; series. The first was &quot;Action Quake 2&quot; and the third was &quot;Action Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;.

== Gameplay ==

The traditional mode of gameplay is Deathmatch; at the start of a round, players must choose a single pistol, a unique weapon, and a special item. Unlike the buy menu in &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, these weapons are free and have limited ammunition, which makes tactical usage crucial. The game also includes a &quot;last man standing&quot; mode, which plays like a deathmatch, but without respawning after death.

&quot;Action Half-life&quot; also features a single player mode. Some unique features in this mode include a move called &quot;Adrenaline Rush&quot;, similar to Bullet Time. 
==Reception ==

&quot;Action Half-Life&quot; was the favored modification for a small subculture described by Rock, Paper, Shotgun&#x27;s writer Quintin Smith as a &quot;mad cabal of mappers who obsessed over easter eggs&quot;, with some levels containing secret areas much larger and more complex than the main level. These often included whole story-lines, puzzles, and scripted sequences.

Gigi Leung Wing-kei (; born 25 March 1976) is a Hong Kong singer and actress.

==Early life==
She was born at Tsan Yuk Hospital in Sai Ying Pun on 25 March 1976 and was given the name Leung Pik-chi () for superstitious reasons; as a child, Leung suffered from frequent asthma attacks and it was believed a change of name would bring better health. At 176 cm, Leung earned the nickname of &#x27;Tall Girl&#x27;. She has a twin brother named Keith Leung Wing-chun (Leung Wing-chun, ).

Gigi Leung attended Maryknoll Convent School. Later, she went to the Hong Kong Polytechnic University where she gained a diploma from the School of Design. It was during her study at university that she accepted a modelling assignment from the watch company City Chain and caught the attention of film director Lee Chi-ngai who cast her in her very first movie, &quot;Doctor Mack&quot; (1995). The success of the movie brought her a further role in &quot;Full Throttle&quot; (1995), shot while she was finishing her diploma. For her supporting role in the film, Leung received a nomination for Best Newcomer at the 1995 Hong Kong Film Awards.

==Career==
Her singing career began the following year with the debut album &quot;Love Myself&quot; (1996). Since then, she has sung both Cantonese and Mandarin songs. She is recognised not only as a Cantopop/Mandopop singer, but as a songwriter and lyricist as well, having written songs for both herself and other local singers. She has a contract with Warner Music Hong Kong, with more than a dozen albums to her name. She has performed in several full-scale live concerts including one entitled &quot;Funny Face&quot; in 2003.

In 2008 25 March she signed a contract with Big Artiste Management, a subsidiary of Mei Ah Entertainment.

Since 1995, Leung has starred in over 20 movies, most of which are dramas and comedies. In 2003, she starred with Takeshi Kaneshiro in &quot;Turn Left, Turn Right&quot;. Notably, at the Hong Kong Film Awards, Leung was nominated for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for roles in &quot;Tempting Heart&quot; (1999) and &quot;A War Named Desire&quot; (2000) respectively.

Primarily an actress on the silver screen, Leung briefly appeared in the TVB serial &quot;The Last Breakthrough&quot; (2004). She has also performed in a number of stage musicals including &quot;The Great Entertainer&quot; (2004). Other works include the Cantonese narration for the Japanese film &quot;Quill&quot; (2004).

Leung is also active in charity work. Apart from being the ambassador for different charities, she has helped to build 7 schools in Mainland China to help poor children. She is also the youngest-ever local (at age 27) to receive the &quot;Ten Most Outstanding Youth Award&quot; in Hong Kong.

Leung is popular not just in Hong Kong, but also in Mainland China, Taiwan and Southeast Asia.

===Spokesperson===
Leung worked as an ambassador to both United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) and World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) Hong Kong. Other charity ambassador titles include Honourably Ambassador of Yan Chai Hospital, Special Ambassador to the Yan Aiu Hospital, Ambassador of Breast Cancer Fund and Ambassador of Society for Abandoned Animals (SAA). She also held numerous other special titles to organizations, including &quot;Hope Foundation.&quot;

==Personal life==
Gigi Leung had a seven-year relationship with singer-actor Ekin Cheng. They broke up in 2006.

In July 2009, she was reported to be in a relationship with a furniture designer from France, known only as Sly. Neither Gigi nor Sly admitted their relationship, but it was reported that the couple separated in early 2010.

On 3 October 2011, Leung married her Spanish boyfriend Sergio Crespo Gutes on the island of Ibiza. On 28 February 2015, Leung gave birth to her first child, a daughter, Sofia Crespo Leung (祈淑菲).

===Weibo incident===
On 30 March 2010, Gigi Leung posted on her Weibo about the plight of Zhao Lianhai, a father-turned-activist whose five-year-old son fell victim to poison milk and developed kidney stones. Leung later deleted the post, and posted another message saying, &quot;The mainland has its own rules. If I need to delete something, so be it. But I still don&#x27;t like to see incidents that are unfair, especially if they happen to regular people.&quot;

<doc id="612874" wikidata="Q61424" url="?curid=612874" title="Acylation">
<text>In chemistry, acylation is a broad class of chemical reactions in which an acyl group () is added to a substrate. The compound providing the acyl group is called the acylating agent. The substrate to be acylated and the product include the following:
*alcohols, esters
*amines, amides
*arenes or alkenes, ketones
A particularly common type of acylation is acetylation, the addition of the acetyl group. Closely related to acylation is formylation, which employ sources of &quot;HCO+ in place of &quot;RCO+&quot;. 

==Examples==
Because they form a strong electrophile when treated with Lewis acids, acyl halides are commonly used as acylating agents. For example, Friedel–Crafts acylation uses acetyl chloride () as the agent and aluminum chloride () as a catalyst to add an acetyl group to benzene:
This reaction is an example of electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Acyl halides and acid anhydrides of carboxylic acids are also common acylating agents. In some cases, active esters exhibit comparable reactivity. All react with amines to form amides and with alcohols to form esters by nucleophilic acyl substitution.

Acylation can be used to prevent rearrangement reactions that would normally occur in alkylation. To do this an acylation reaction is performed, then the carbonyl is removed by Clemmensen reduction or a similar process.

==Acylation in biology==

Protein acylation is the post-translational modification of proteins via the attachment of functional groups through acyl linkages. Protein acylation has been observed as a mechanism controlling biological signaling. One prominent type is fatty acylation, the addition of fatty acids to particular amino acids (e.g. myristoylation, palmitoylation or palmitoleoylation). Different types of fatty acids engage in global protein acylation. Palmitoleoylation is an acylation type where the monounsaturated fatty acid palmitoleic acid is covalently attached to serine or threonine residues of proteins. Palmitoleoylation appears to play a significant role in the trafficking, targeting, and function of Wnt proteins.

<text>Boy&#x27;z is a Hong Kong Cantopop duo produced by EEG consisting of members Kenny Kwan and Steven Cheung. Kwan left the group in 2005, and was replaced with Dennis Mak in 2005. In 2006, William Chan joined the group, forming the trio Sun Boy&#x27;z. The trio disbanded in 2008, but Kwan and Cheung came back together as a duo in 2010.

==History==

===2002–2005: Boy&#x27;z===
Boy&#x27;z was formerly a Hong Kong Cantopop duo that consisted of members Kenny Kwan (關智斌) (born 30 December 1980) and Steven Cheung (張致恆) (born 10 November 1984). The duo was formed around June 2002 by the Emperor Entertainment Group as the male version a year after the female Cantopop duo Twins was formed. Boy&#x27;z has released 3 EPs and two albums. Their debut EP, La La 世界 (La La World), was released in 2003.

They were based on another Hong Kong popular prefabricated duo, Twins, who was also formed by Emperor Entertainment Group. Boy&#x27;z received main roles in films such as The Death Curse (2003) and PaPa Loves You (2004). They were cameos as robbers in Jackie Chan&#x27;s film New Police Story (2004). As their popularity grew, Boy&#x27;z gained their starring roles in the film, 6:00 AM (2004).

On 13 January 2005, it was announced that Boy&#x27;z would be splitting and disband as early plans and Kenny Kwan would continue his career as a solo artist. In February 2005, Dennis Mak (麥子豪, born 7 May 1987), top 5 finalist of the EEG Singing Contest 2004, who was originally planned to have a solo career, will continue Boy&#x27;z with Steven Cheung. The duo&#x27;s popularity went down after Kenny left, mainly because they have not released any recorded material since then. Dennis and Steven were arranged to train in dancing and gymnastics. Then, they were spotted by a management company in Japan and wanted to sign them but their manager did not release them.

===2006–2009: Sun Boy&#x27;z===
On 26 June 2006, winner of 2003 International Chinese New Talent Singing Championship – Hong Kong Regional Finals, William Chan (陳偉霆, born 21 November 1985) joined the group and Boy&#x27;z was eventually renamed as Sun Boy&#x27;z. They released their first single called &quot;Tic Tac Toe&quot; shortly before June 2006, from their self-titled debut EP. This EP included the song &quot;拜金小姐&quot; which was sung and performed by only Dennis and Steven because the song was recorded prior to William joining the group. Therefore, the Mandarin version of this song, &quot;好時代&quot;, had William on lead vocals completely. The group made a sudden street performance on 3 September 2006.

In early 2007, Sun Boy&#x27;z recorded the cover version of the song &quot;Little Wonders&quot; by Rob Thomas called &quot;由夢開始&quot; for the Hong Kong version of &quot;Meet The Robinsons&quot;. On 2 January 2007, the group released a new music video and song &quot;3+1=1&quot;. The song features former member Kenny Kwan and the title&#x27;s meaning is referring to the four of them always being together as one, even though Kenny is no longer a member of the group. This song is on their greatest hits album All For 1, released on 22 March 2007. The album includes the best of Boy&#x27;z and Sun Boy&#x27;z songs along with 3 new songs. After having success in the cantopop music scene, their record company EEG decided to have them turn to mandopop and a new Mandarin album titled 初次約會 (First Date) was released on 17 December 2007. They have been promoting the new album in the Guangzhou and other parts of China since the release of the new album.

Their duet song &quot;大不了 (No Big Deal)&quot; along with a music video they recorded alongside labelmate Yumiko Cheng, was released on 1 February 2008 in Yumiko&#x27;s album titled 超模 (Super Model). As Boy&#x27;z with Steven and Dennis, they had recorded about 3 unreleased songs, one of the songs is &quot;拜金小姐&quot; which they had performed live on several occasions. And as Sun Boy&#x27;z, they have released one self-titled EP and two albums up to date since 2006 with the newest album being a Mandarin album focusing on their Mandarin speaking fans.

They had done 3 advertisements, had a cameo in the film &quot;McDull, The Alumni (2006)&quot; and main roles in &quot;The Haunted School (2007)&quot;. On 14 August 2006, a 45-minute-long music video titled &quot;Say Goodbye...Luisa&quot; from Isabella Leong&#x27;s album Say Goodbye...Luisa (雪 再見) was released starring Isabella Leong and Steven Cheung while William Chan only had a guest appearance.

In April 2008, there have been rumours spread that William Chan would be separated from Sun Boy&#x27;z and go solo. It has been confirmed that William will begin to pursue a solo career and only appear publicly with Sun Boy&#x27;z once in a while. After William Chan left the group, Sun Boy&#x27;z became a cantopop duo with only Steven Cheung and Dennis Mak. It was officially confirmed in December 2008 that Sun Boy&#x27;z will disband with Dennis Mak leaving the entertainment industry. The reason to this decision is because he has decided to study Hotel Management in Switzerland. In the meantime, Steven Cheung, William Chan and Kenny Kwan would continue to pursue their careers as solo artists.

===2010–present: Boy&#x27;z reunion===
In 2010, Boy&#x27;z (Kenny Kwan and Steven Cheung) appeared on stage together in EEG 10th Anniversary Concert. In 2011, they released a new single together titled &quot;Ready to Go&quot;.

<text>Juno Mak (; born 18 March 1984) is a Hong Kong singer, record producer, actor, and director. He made his musical debut in 2002 with the EP &quot;On the Road.&quot; His albums have won Best Record three times at the Ultimate Song Chart Awards Presentation. 

He made his directorial debut with the horror film &quot;Rigor Mortis&quot; in 2013.

==Career==
===Music===
Mak began his music career as a pop singer with Universal Music. Two albums, &quot;On the Road&quot; and &quot;Next Step&quot;, were released with Universal Music. Both albums reached the top spot on TVB. Although he won awards upon his debut, it was later rumoured that his fans were hired professional groupies earning up to HKD150 an hour, and in 2002 he was booed by audience members during an awards ceremony. 

Mak&#x27;s 2015 EP &quot;Addendum&quot; spawned the number one singles &quot;Unforgettable&quot; (念念不忘), &quot;Imperfection&quot; (瑕疵), and the award-winning duet &quot;Rashōmon&quot; (羅生門), a duet with Kay Tse. 

===Film===
In 2010, Mak wrote and starred in Wong Ching-po&#x27;s film &quot;&quot;. The film was a hybrid of slasher and love story. Mak and Wong Ching-po collaborated again in 2011 on the film &quot;Let&#x27;s Go!&quot;.

In 2013, Mak directed the film &quot;Rigor Mortis&quot;, which pays tribute to the 1980s Jiangshi genre. In 2015, it was announced Mak would direct the crime thriller &quot;Sons of the Neon Night.&quot; 

==Anti-graft investigation==
In 2003, Mak, his father, and a number of music executives from TVB and Universal Music HK were arrested as part of an investigation into an alleged bribes-for-awards scam. The case was eventually withdrawn with no charges made.

==Personal life==
Mak is the second son of Clement Mak, the chairman of CCT Fortis Holdings Limited.

<text>2R is a former cantopop duo group in Hong Kong. The duo group consisted of the two sisters Rosanne Wong and Race Wong, who were born in Malaysia and raised in Singapore with Rosanne being the elder sister.

They have a dedicated fan base and their recent albums, &quot;2R Revolution&quot; and &quot;2R New + Best Selection&quot;, have been reasonably successful. The motion picture &quot;Ab-Normal Beauty&quot; () starring the two sisters also earned Race Wong a &quot;Best New Actor nomination&quot; at the Hong Kong Film Award and Golden Horse Award.
==Biography==
Both of them were born in Malaysia but moved to Singapore with their family at very early ages. Rosanne was born on 30 June 1979, while Race was born on 7 September 1982. Before entering show business, they studied together at Fowlie Primary School, Tanjong Katong Secondary School, Curtin University of Technology in Perth, Western Australia. The pair were discovered by an agent during a singing contest in 1998 and were brought to Hong Kong. They eventually signed by Universal Music.

==Beginning==
Although 2R has yet to achieve the level of success that others have in the beginning, they arguably went through a much harder time. The agent who initially signed the sisters had arranged an apartment for them in Hong Kong and was able to get them a few modelling jobs but nothing substantial materialised. Meanwhile, the sisters were working on improving their Cantonese while recording their first album in the hopes of attracting more fans. However, their agent suddenly disappeared and the sisters were burdened with several months of unpaid rent and were eventually evicted. Without agent and money, the sisters turned to their parents who helped them pay off their debt and found them a new home. Soon afterwards they were signed by Universal Music.

==Separate success==
Although 2R usually perform together, the sisters exhibit two different styles. Rosanne the elder sister is more mature, naive and elegant, while Race is more youthful and energetic. However it is Race who has experienced the greater success with appearances in various commercials, magazine covers, and movies. In the movie &quot;Sound of Colours&quot; (), both Rosanne and Race made cameo appearances but only Race&#x27;s scene made it to the big screen. They also starred in the Wong Jing&#x27;s movie &quot;Love Is A Many Stupid Thing&quot; (精裝追女仔2004) where Race played a major role while Rosanne&#x27;s character was limited to just a few on screen appearances. It was not until &quot;Ab-normal Beauty&quot; () in 2004 that both sisters played significant parts. It was followed by &quot;China&#x27;s Next Top Princess&quot; () in 2005, and &quot;The Smiling Proud Wanderer&quot; stage performance by the Hong Kong Dance Company in 2006.

<text>Project Chariot was a 1958 United States Atomic Energy Commission proposal to construct an artificial harbor at Cape Thompson on the North Slope of the U.S. state of Alaska by burying and detonating a string of nuclear devices.
 The project originated as part of Operation Plowshare, a research project to find peaceful uses for nuclear explosives. Substantial local opposition, objections from environmental scientists, and the absence of any credible economic benefit caused the plan to be quietly shelved.
== History ==
A 1957 meeting at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory (LRL) proposed a program to use nuclear explosives for industrial development projects. This proposal became the basis for Project Plowshare, administered by the United States Atomic Energy Commission. Chariot was to be the first Plowshare project, and was imagined as a way to show how larger projects, such as a widened Panama Canal, or a sea-level Nicaragua Canal, might be accomplished.

The plan was championed by LRL director and nuclear scientist Edward Teller, who traveled throughout Alaska touting the harbor as an important economic development for America&#x27;s newest state. Teller promoted a study by the LRL that proposed development of coal deposits in the area. Despite being blocked by ice for nine months of the year, Teller and the LRL proposed the harbor as a port for coal shipment. The mines themselves would have been on the far side of the Brooks Range, requiring a railroad and storage facilities for the coal waiting to be shipped.

As the plan developed, nuclear testing at the Nevada Test Site indicated that smaller explosions could accomplish much to the publicly-stated goals of the project with less risk of radioactive releases or contamination. At the same time, as it became apparent that there could be little economic justification for the project, the program shifted to a more clearly avowed program for testing nuclear excavation in a remote location.

Alaskan political leaders, newspaper editors, president William Ransom Wood of the University of Alaska, even church groups all rallied in support of the massive detonation. Congress had passed the Alaska Statehood Act just a few weeks before. An editorial in the July 24, 1960 &quot;Fairbanks News-Miner&quot; said, &quot;We think the holding of a huge nuclear blast in Alaska would be a fitting overture to the new era which is opening for our state.&quot;

==Opposition and abandonment==
Opposition came from the Inupiaq Alaska Native village of Point Hope, a few scientists engaged in environmental studies under AEC contract, and a handful of conservationists. The grassroots protest soon was picked up by organizations with national reach, such as The Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club, and Barry Commoner&#x27;s Committee for Nuclear Information. Repeated visits to the community by AEC officials failed to sway local and Native residents, who opposed land transfers by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to the AEC. Activism opposing the project contributed to Native organization and Native rights activism, which contributed to the establishment of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971.

Internationally, the project drew objections from the Soviet Union, which viewed such projects as a way of circumventing the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, at the time in negotiation.

In 1962, facing increased public uneasiness over the environmental risk and the potential to disrupt the lives of the Alaska Native peoples, the AEC announced that Project Chariot would be &quot;held in abeyance.&quot; It has never been formally canceled.

In addition to the objections of the local population, no practical use of such a harbor was ever identified. The environmental studies commissioned by the AEC suggested that radioactive contamination from the proposed blast could adversely affect the health and safety of the local people, whose livelihoods were based on hunting animals. The investigations noted that radiation from worldwide fallout was moving with unusual efficiency up the food chain in the Arctic, from lichen, to caribou (which fed on lichen), to humans (for whom caribou was a primary food source). Studies also showed that the blasts would thaw the permafrost, making the slopes surrounding the harbor unstable, and negating any experimental value to be gained from using the project as a basis for extrapolation to other, warmer locations. While the AEC publicly touted prevailing winds from the north for dispersing radioactivity over the sea, the AEC privately desired to study landward distribution. The consistent wind patterns would prevent northward fallout patterns over land.

In the meantime, test shots in Nevada provided the data that the AEC sought for radiation release modeling. The very small 430-ton equivalent Danny Boy test in March 1962 encouraged the AEC to stage much larger 104-kiloton Sedan test in July 1962. Gerald Johnson, the director of Project Plowshare, described the Sedan test as &quot;an alternative to Chariot&quot; arising from frustration at recommendations for Chariot&#x27;s cancellation. Fallout from Sedan turned out to be the second-highest of any test in Nevada.

==Plan==
The project initially envisioned the use of four 100 kiloton devices to excavate a channel, and two one-megaton devices to excavate a turning basin, for a total of 2.4 megatons of explosive equivalent, displacing of earth. Later iterations reduced the explosive total to 480 kilotons, and subsequently proposed a 280 kiloton test or demonstration. The latter plan proposed two or three 20 kiloton explosions and two more of approximately 200 kilotons each, for a correspondingly smaller basin.

==Contamination==
Although the detonation never occurred, the site was radioactively contaminated by an experiment to estimate the effect on water sources of radioactive ejecta, landing on tundra plants, and subsequently washed down and carried away by rains. Material from a 1962 nuclear explosion at the Nevada Test Site was transported to the Chariot site in August 1962, used in several experiments, then buried. The site comprised a mound of about , about tall. Thirty years later, the disposal was discovered in archival documents by a University of Alaska researcher. State officials immediately traveled to the site and found low levels of radioactivity at a depth of two feet (60 cm) in the burial mound. Outraged residents of the Inupiat village of Point Hope, who had experienced an unusually high rate of cancer deaths, demanded the removal of the contaminated soil, which the government did at its expense in 1993.

The sites for test boreholes drilled for Project Chariot were remediated in 2014. The five boreholes, drilled in the early 1960s, had used refrigerated diesel fuel as a drilling fluid, contaminating the surrounding area.

<doc id="612897" wikidata="Q8020938" url="?curid=612897" title="William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury">
<text>William à Court, 1st Baron Heytesbury (11 July 1779 – 31 May 1860), known as Sir William à Court, 2nd Baronet, from 1817 to 1828, was an English diplomat and Conservative politician.

==Background and education==
Heytesbury was the eldest son of Sir William à Court, 1st Baronet, and Laetitia, daughter of Henry Wyndham. He was educated at Eton and entered the Diplomatic Service at an early age.

==Political and diplomatic career==
In 1812 Heytesbury was elected to the House of Commons for Dorchester, a seat he held until 1814. He was also Envoy Extraordinary to the Barbary States from 1813 to 1814, to the Kingdom of Naples in 1814 and to Spain from 1822 to 1824 and served as Ambassador to Portugal between 1824 and 1828.

The latter year Heytesbury was appointed Ambassador to Russia, where he had to deal with the Russo-Turkish War of 1828 to 1829 and the tensions created by the Russian Empire&#x27;s occupation of the Danubian Principalities. He remained in Russia until 1832. In 1835 Sir Robert Peel nominated him for the office of Governor-General of India, but the Tory government soon fell and he never took up the post. However, he later served under Peel as Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland from 1844 to 1846, and presided over the beginning of the Great Famine (Ireland). Heytesbury succeeded his father as second Baronet in 1817, was admitted to the Privy Council the same year and made a GCB in 1819. In 1828 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Heytesbury, of Heytesbury in the County of Wiltshire.

==Family==
Lord Heytesbury married Maria Rebecca, daughter of the Hon. William Henry Bouverie, in 1808. They had four sons and two daughters. He died in May 1860, aged 80, and was succeeded in his titles by his eldest son William.

<text>The Life Peerages Act 1958 (6 &amp; 7 Eliz. 2. c. 21) established the modern standards for the creation of life peers by the Sovereign of the United Kingdom.

==Background==
This Act was passed during the Conservative governments of 1957–1964, when Harold Macmillan was Prime Minister. Elizabeth II had ascended to the throne just over five years before the Act. The Conservatives tried to introduce life peerages to modernise the House of Lords, give it more legitimacy, and respond to a decline in its numbers and attendance.

=== Passage ===
The Life Peerages Bill was introduced into the House of Lords on 21 November 1957, and its second reading took place on 3 and 5 December 1957. Committee stage was taken on 17 and 18 December 1957. The bill was reported without amendment and given a third reading on 30 January 1958.

In the Commons, the second reading took place on 12 and 13 February 1958. The second reading debate was lengthy; the first day of second reading saw 21 speeches and 29 interruptions, while the second day contained 18 speeches, with 46 interruptions. The Labour Party opposed the Life Peerages Bill on Second Reading: Hugh Gaitskell made an impassioned speech against the proposals, arguing for a far more fundamental reform such as total dismantling of the Lords or a wholly elected house. At the end of the debate, an opposition amendment declining a second reading to the bill was defeated by 305 votes to 251. The bill was given a third reading on 2 April 1958 by 292 votes to 241 and received royal assent on 30 April 1958. The first batch of 14 life peers was announced on 24 July 1958.

==Summary==
Prior to the Life Peerages Act 1958, membership in the House of Lords was strictly male and overwhelmingly based on possession of a hereditary title. There existed a few exceptions to the hereditary principle, such as for the Lords Spiritual. The Act made it possible for life peers of both sexes to be members of the Lords. Life peers are either barons (a title in existence since the Middle Ages; holders are usually known as &quot;Lord&quot; for all but the most formal documents) or baronesses (where female; conventionally they choose to be known as &quot;Lady X&quot; or &quot;Baroness X&quot; as preferred) and are members of the House of Lords for life, but their titles and membership in the House of Lords cannot be inherited by their children. Judicial life peers already sat in the House under the terms of the Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876. The Life Peerages Act greatly increased the ability of prime ministers to change the composition of the House of Lords by permitting the creation of groups of life peers rather than hereditary peerages. This gradually diminished the numerical dominance of hereditary peers.

The Act allowed for the creation of female peers entitled to sit in the House of Lords. The first four such women peers were: Barbara Wootton and Stella Isaacs, who were sworn in on 21 October 1958, and Katharine Elliot and Irene Curzon, who took office the next day.

A life peer is created by the sovereign by letters patent under the Great Seal on the advice of the Prime Minister.

Before the Act was enacted, former prime ministers were usually created hereditary viscounts or earls in recognition of their public service in high office, as were the Viceroys of India and exceptional military or front bench figures, for example the former Secretary of State for India and earlier for Air, Viscount Stansgate, and retired Speakers of the House of Commons. The last prime minister and the last non-royal to be created an earl was coincidentally one of the 1958 Act&#x27;s proponents, Harold Macmillan, on Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s advice, in the 1980s. Since her time, only members of the Royal Family have been granted new hereditary peerages. In 2023, Prince Edward, already hereditary Earl of Wessex and Forfar, was made Duke of Edinburgh for life, though not under the Act.

==Historic approval and 1999 adjustment of House composition==
In 1999, during the debate which secured the removal of the constitutional functions of most hereditary peers, the Minister for Constitutional Affairs, Geoff Hoon stated:

After this agreed with a question from fellow Labour MP, Mark Fisher which stated:

<text>City comedy, also known as citizen comedy, is a genre of comedy in the English early modern theatre.

==Definition==

Emerging from Ben Jonson&#x27;s late-Elizabethan comedies of humours (1598–1599), the conventions of city comedy developed rapidly in the first decade of the Jacobean era, as one playwright&#x27;s innovations were soon adopted by others, such that by about 1605 the new genre was fully established. Its principal playwrights were Jonson himself, Thomas Middleton, and John Marston, though many others also contributed to its development, including Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, John Day, and John Webster. Once the companies of boy players—the Children of Paul&#x27;s and the Children of the Chapel—had resumed public performances from 1600 onwards, most of their plays were city comedies. The closest that William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays come to the genre is the slightly earlier &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (c. 1597), which is his only play set entirely in England; it avoids the caustic satire of city comedy, however, in preference for a more bourgeois mode (with its dual romantic plots governed by socio-economics not love or sex), while its setting, Windsor, is a town rather than a city.

In contrast to the adventurous chronicles of Elizabethan comedy, such as Thomas Dekker&#x27;s &quot;The Shoemaker&#x27;s Holiday&quot; (1599) or George Peele&#x27;s &quot;The Old Wives&#x27; Tale&quot; (c. 1590), or the intricately plotted romantic comedies of Shakespeare and John Lyly, city comedy was more realistic (excluding magical or marvellous elements) and sharp and satirical in tone. It portrayed a broad range of characters from different ranks (often focused on citizens), employing &quot;deeds and language such as men do use&quot;, as Jonson put it, and was usually set in London.

During the Tudor period the Reformation had produced a gradual shift to Protestantism and much of London passed from church to private ownership. The Royal Exchange was founded in this period. Mercantilism grew, and monopoly trading companies such as the East India Company were established, with trade expanding to the New World. London became the principal North Sea port, with migrants arriving from England and abroad. The population rose from an estimated 50,000 in 1530 to about 225,000 in 1605. City comedies depict London as a hotbed of vice and folly; in particular, Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Epicoene&quot;, Middleton&#x27;s &quot;A Trick to Catch the Old One&quot; and &quot;A Chaste Maid in Cheapside&quot;, and Marston&#x27;s &quot;The Dutch Courtesan.&quot;

Verna Foster has argued that John Ford&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; (c. 1629–1633) re-works many of the features of city comedy within a tragic drama.

<text>The Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 59) was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that altered the judicial functions of the House of Lords by allowing senior judges to sit in the House of Lords as life peers with the rank of baron, known as Lords of Appeal in Ordinary. The first person to be made a law lord under its terms was Sir Colin Blackburn on 16 October 1876, who became &quot;Baron Blackburn&quot;.

The Act was repealed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005, which transferred the judicial functions from the House of Lords to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. Following the creation of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the practice of appointing Lords of Appeal in Ordinary was discontinued. The last person to be made a law lord was Sir Brian Kerr on 29 June 2009, who became &quot;Baron Kerr of Tonaghmore&quot;.

<text>Minibosses is an American progressive rock band originally from Northampton, Massachusetts, and now located in Phoenix, Arizona. They are known for their video game music covers, which are instrumental rock variations of the theme music from classic Nintendo video games such as &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Metroid&quot;, and &quot;Castlevania&quot;. The &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; awarded Minibosses their &quot;best cover band&quot; award in 2006.

==History==
From 1997 to 1999, guitarist Aaron Burke and drummer Matt Wood played in Jenova Project, one of the earliest video game cover bands, along with other friends from the same dorm at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In January 2000, Burke and Wood recruited bassist Ben Baraldi to form Minibosses. Initially, the band played both video game covers as well as original songs, and self-released their first album in September 2000. They were unsatisfied with the quality of this album and have since released new versions of their covers (as well as new covers) on the &quot;Minibosses/Penny Winblood&quot; split and &quot;Brass&quot; album. At the same time, they replaced their older songs, which had been freely available to download, with the newer versions found on &quot;Brass&quot;. From 2000 to present, the band has toured continuously while recording material for new albums.

<text>Christian mysticism is the tradition of mystical practices and mystical theology within Christianity which &quot;concerns the preparation [of the person] for, the consciousness of, and the effect of [...] a direct and transformative presence of God&quot; or divine &quot;love&quot;. Until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term contemplatio, c.q. theoria, from &quot;contemplatio&quot; (Latin; Greek θεωρία, &quot;theoria&quot;), &quot;looking at&quot;, &quot;gazing at&quot;, &quot;being aware of&quot; God or the divine. Christianity took up the use of both the Greek (&quot;theoria&quot;) and Latin (&quot;contemplatio&quot;, contemplation) terminology to describe various forms of prayer and the process of coming to know God.

Contemplative practices range from simple prayerful meditation of holy scripture (i.e. Lectio Divina) to contemplation on the presence of God, resulting in theosis (spiritual union with God) and ecstatic visions of the soul&#x27;s mystical union with God. Three stages are discerned in contemplative practice, namely catharsis (purification), contemplation proper, and the vision of God.

Contemplative practices have a prominent place in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodoxy, and have gained a renewed interest in Western Christianity.
==Etymology==

=== &quot;Theoria&quot; ===
The Greek &quot;theoria&quot; (θεωρία) meant &quot;contemplation, speculation, a looking at, things looked at&quot;, from &quot;theorein&quot; (θεωρεῖν) &quot;to consider, speculate, look at&quot;, from &quot;theoros&quot; (θεωρός) &quot;spectator&quot;, from &quot;thea&quot; (θέα) &quot;a view&quot; + &quot;horan&quot; (ὁρᾶν) &quot;to see&quot;. It expressed the state of being a . Both Greek &quot;θεωρία&quot; and Latin &quot;contemplatio&quot; primarily meant looking at things, whether with the eyes or with the mind.

According to William Johnston, until the sixth century the practice of what is now called mysticism was referred to by the term &quot;contemplatio&quot;, c.q. &quot;theoria&quot;. According to Johnston, &quot;[b]oth contemplation and mysticism speak of the eye of love which is looking at, gazing at, aware of divine realities.&quot;

Several scholars have demonstrated similarities between the Greek idea of &quot;theoria&quot; and the Indian idea of &quot;darśana&quot; (darshan), including Ian Rutherford and Gregory Grieve.

===Mysticism===

&quot;Mysticism&quot; is derived from the Greek μύω, meaning &quot;to conceal,&quot; and its derivative , &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;an initiate.&quot; In the Hellenistic world, a &quot;mystikos&quot; was an initiate of a mystery religion. &quot;Mystical&quot; referred to secret religious rituals and use of the word lacked any direct references to the transcendental.

In early Christianity the term &quot;mystikos&quot; referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative. The biblical dimension refers to &quot;hidden&quot; or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures. The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ at the Eucharist. The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.

==Definition of mysticism==
===Transformative presence of God===
Bernard McGinn defines Christian mysticism as: 
McGinn argues that &quot;presence&quot; is more accurate than &quot;union,&quot; since not all mystics spoke of union with God, and since many visions and miracles were not necessarily related to union.

===Presence versus experience===
McGinn also argues that we should speak of &quot;consciousness&quot; of God&#x27;s presence, rather than of &quot;experience&quot;, since mystical activity is not simply about the sensation of God as an external object, but more broadly about 
William James popularized the use of the term &quot;religious experience&quot; in his 1902 book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;. It has also influenced the understanding of mysticism as a distinctive experience which supplies knowledge.

Wayne Proudfoot traces the roots of the notion of religious experience further back to the German theologian Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768–1834), who argued that religion is based on a feeling of the infinite. The notion of religious experience was used by Schleiermacher to defend religion against the growing scientific and secular critique. It was adopted by many scholars of religion, of which William James was the most influential.

===Interpersonal transformation===

McGinn&#x27;s emphasis on the transformation that occurs through mystical activity relates to this idea of &quot;presence&quot; instead of &quot;experience&quot;: 

Parsons points out that the stress on &quot;experience&quot; is accompanied by favoring the atomic individual, instead of the shared life of the community. It also fails to distinguish between episodic experience, and mysticism as a process that is embedded in a total religious matrix of liturgy, scripture, worship, virtues, theology, rituals and practices.

Richard King also points to disjunction between &quot;mystical experience&quot; and social justice:
===Social construction===
Mystical experience is not simply a matter between the mystic and God, but is often shaped by cultural issues. For instance, Caroline Bynum has shown how, in the late Middle Ages, miracles attending the taking of the Eucharist were not simply symbolic of the Passion story, but served as vindication of the mystic&#x27;s theological orthodoxy by proving that the mystic had not fallen prey to heretical ideas, such as the Cathar rejection of the material world as evil, contrary to orthodox teaching that God took on human flesh and remained sinless. Thus, the nature of mystical experience could be tailored to the particular cultural and theological issues of the time.

==Origins==
The idea of mystical realities has been widely held in Christianity since the second century AD, referring not simply to spiritual practices, but also to the belief that their rituals and even their scriptures have hidden (&quot;mystical&quot;) meanings.

The link between mysticism and the vision of the divine was introduced by the early Church Fathers, who used the term as an adjective, as in mystical theology and mystical contemplation.

In subsequent centuries, especially as Christian apologetics began to use Greek philosophy to explain Christian ideas, Neoplatonism became an influence on Christian mystical thought and practice via such authors as Augustine of Hippo and Origen.

===Jewish antecedents===
Jewish spirituality in the period before Jesus was highly corporate and public, based mostly on the worship services of the synagogues, which included the reading and interpretation of the Hebrew Scriptures and the recitation of prayers, and on the major festivals. Thus, private spirituality was strongly influenced by the liturgies and by the scriptures (e.g., the use of the Psalms for prayer), and individual prayers often recalled historical events just as much as they recalled their own immediate needs.

Of special importance are the following concepts:
* &quot;Binah&quot; (understanding), and &quot;Chokmah&quot; (wisdom), which come from years of reading, praying and meditating the scriptures;
* &quot;Shekhinah&quot;, the presence of God in our daily lives, the superiority of that presence to earthly wealth, the pain and longing that come when God is absent; and the nurturing, feminine aspect of God;
* the hiddenness of God, which comes from our inability to survive the full revelation of God&#x27;s glory and which forces us to seek to know God through faith and obedience;
* &quot;Torah-mysticism&quot;, a view of God&#x27;s laws as the central expression of God&#x27;s will and therefore as worthy object not only of obedience but also of loving meditation and Torah study; and
* poverty, an ascetic value, based on the apocalyptic expectation of God&#x27;s impending arrival, that characterized the Jewish people&#x27;s reaction to being oppressed by a series of foreign empires.

In Christian mysticism, &quot;Shekhinah&quot; became mystery, &quot;Da&#x27;at&quot; (knowledge) became gnosis, and poverty became an important component of monasticism.

===Greek influences===
The term &quot;theoria&quot; was used by the ancient Greeks to refer to the act of experiencing or observing, and then comprehending through &quot;nous&quot;.

The influences of Greek thought are apparent in the earliest Christian mystics and their writings. Plato (428–348 BC) is considered the most important of ancient philosophers, and his philosophical system provides the basis of most later mystical forms. Plotinus (c. 205 – 270 AD) provided the non-Christian, neo-Platonic basis for much Christian, Jewish and Islamic mysticism.

====Plato====

For Plato, what the contemplative (&quot;theoros&quot;) contemplates (&quot;theorei&quot;) are the Forms, the realities underlying the individual appearances, and one who contemplates these atemporal and aspatial realities is enriched with a perspective on ordinary things superior to that of ordinary people. Philip of Opus viewed &quot;theoria&quot; as contemplation of the stars, with practical effects in everyday life similar to those that Plato saw as following from contemplation of the Forms.

In the &quot;Enneads&quot; of Plotinus (c.204/5–270 CE), a founder of Neoplatonism, everything is contemplation (&quot;theoria&quot;) and everything is derived from contemplation. The first hypostasis, the One, is contemplation (by the nous, or second hypostasis) in that &quot;it turns to itself in the simplest regard, implying no complexity or need&quot;; this reflecting back on itself emanated (not created) the second hypostasis, Intellect (in Greek Νοῦς, &quot;Nous&quot;), Plotinus describes as &quot;living contemplation&quot;, being &quot;self-reflective and contemplative activity par excellence&quot;, and the third hypostatic level has &quot;theoria&quot;. Knowledge of the one is achieved through experience of its power, an experience that is contemplation (&quot;theoria&quot;) of the source of all things.

Plotinus agreed with Aristotle&#x27;s systematic distinction between contemplation (&quot;theoria&quot;) and practice (&quot;praxis&quot;): dedication to the superior life of &quot;theoria&quot; requires abstention from practical, active life. Plotinus explained: &quot;The point of action is contemplation. ... Contemplation is therefore the end of action&quot; and &quot;Such is the life of the divinity and of divine and blessed men: detachments from all things here below, scorn of all earthly pleasures, the flight of the lone to the Alone.&quot;

===Early church===
====New Testament writings====
The Christian scriptures, insofar as they are the founding narrative of the Christian church, provide many key stories and concepts that become important for Christian mystics in all later generations: practices such as the Eucharist, baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Prayer all become activities that take on importance for both their ritual and symbolic values. Other scriptural narratives present scenes that become the focus of meditation: the crucifixion of Jesus and his appearances after his resurrection are two of the most central to Christian theology; but Jesus&#x27; conception, in which the Holy Spirit overshadows Mary, and his transfiguration, in which he is briefly revealed in his heavenly glory, also become important images for meditation. Moreover, many of the Christian texts build on Jewish spiritual foundations, such as &quot;chokmah&quot;, &quot;shekhinah&quot;.

But different writers present different images and ideas. The Synoptic Gospels (in spite of their many differences) introduce several important ideas, two of which are related to Greco-Judaic notions of knowledge/&quot;gnosis&quot; by virtue of being mental acts: purity of heart, in which we will to see in God&#x27;s light; and repentance, which involves allowing God to judge and then transform us. Another key idea presented by the Synoptics is the desert, which is used as a metaphor for the place where we meet God in the poverty of our spirit.

The Gospel of John focuses on God&#x27;s glory in his use of light imagery and in his presentation of the cross as a moment of exaltation; he also sees the cross as the example of &quot;agape&quot; love, a love which is not so much an emotion as a willingness to serve and care for others. But in stressing love, John shifts the goal of spiritual growth away from knowledge/&quot;gnosis&quot;, which he presents more in terms of Stoic ideas about the role of reason as being the underlying principle of the universe and as the spiritual principle within all people. Although John does not follow up on the Stoic notion that this principle makes union with the divine possible for humanity, it is an idea that later Christian writers develop. Later generations will also shift back and forth between whether to follow the Synoptics in stressing knowledge or John in stressing love.

In his letters, Paul also focuses on mental activities, but not in the same way as the Synoptics, which equate renewing the mind with repentance. Instead, Paul sees the renewal of our minds as happening as we contemplate what Jesus did on the cross, which then opens us to grace and to the movement of the Holy Spirit into peoples&#x27; hearts. Like John, Paul is less interested in knowledge, preferring to emphasize the hiddenness, the &quot;mystery&quot; of God&#x27;s plan as revealed through Christ. But Paul&#x27;s discussion of the Cross differs from John&#x27;s in being less about how it reveals God&#x27;s glory and more about how it becomes the stumbling block that turns our minds back to God. Paul also describes the Christian life as that of an athlete, demanding practice and training for the sake of the prize; later writers will see in this image a call to ascetical practices.

====Apostolic Fathers====
The texts attributed to the Apostolic Fathers, the earliest post-Biblical texts we have, share several key themes, particularly the call to unity in the face of internal divisions and perceptions of persecution, the reality of the charisms, especially prophecy, visions, and Christian &quot;gnosis&quot;, which is understood as &quot;a gift of the Holy Spirit that enables us to know Christ&quot; through meditating on the scriptures and on the cross of Christ. (This understanding of &quot;gnosis&quot; is not the same as that developed by the Gnostics, who focused on esoteric knowledge that is available only to a few people but that allows them to free themselves from the evil world.) These authors also discuss the notion of the &quot;two ways&quot;, that is, the way of life and the way of death; this idea has biblical roots, being found in both the Sermon on the Mount and the Torah. The two ways are then related to the notion of purity of heart, which is developed by contrasting it against the divided or duplicitous heart and by linking it to the need for asceticism, which keeps the heart whole/pure. Purity of heart was especially important given perceptions of martyrdom, which many writers discussed in theological terms, seeing it not as an evil but as an opportunity to truly die for the sake of God—the ultimate example of ascetic practice. Martyrdom could also be seen as symbolic in its connections with the Eucharist and with baptism.

&quot;Theoria&quot; enabled the Fathers to perceive depths of meaning in the biblical writings that escape a purely scientific or empirical approach to interpretation. The Antiochene Fathers, in particular, saw in every passage of Scripture a double meaning, both literal and spiritual. As Frances Margaret Young notes, &quot;Best translated in this context as a type of &quot;insight&quot;, &quot;theoria&quot; was the act of perceiving in the wording and &quot;story&quot; of Scripture a moral and spiritual meaning,&quot; and may be regarded as a form of allegory.

====Alexandrian mysticism====
The Alexandrian contribution to Christian mysticism centers on Origen () and Clement of Alexandria (150–215 AD). Clement was an early Christian humanist who argued that reason is the most important aspect of human existence and that &quot;gnosis&quot; (not something we can attain by ourselves, but the gift of Christ) helps us find the spiritual realities that are hidden behind the natural world and within the scriptures. Given the importance of reason, Clement stresses &quot;apatheia&quot; as a reasonable ordering of our passions in order to live within God&#x27;s love, which is seen as a form of truth. Origen, who had a lasting influence on Eastern Christian thought, further develops the idea that the spiritual realities can be found through allegorical readings of the scriptures (along the lines of Jewish aggadah tradition), but he focuses his attention on the cross and on the importance of imitating Christ through the cross, especially through spiritual combat and asceticism. Origen stresses the importance of combining intellect and virtue (&quot;theoria&quot; and &quot;praxis&quot;) in our spiritual exercises, drawing on the image of Moses and Aaron leading the Israelites through the wilderness, and he describes our union with God as the marriage of our souls with Christ the Logos, using the wedding imagery from the Song of Songs. Alexandrian mysticism developed alongside Hermeticism and Neoplatonism and therefore share some of the same ideas, images, etc. in spite of their differences.

Philo of Alexandria (20 BCE – c.  50 CE) was a Jewish Hellenistic philosopher who was important for connecting the Hebrew Scriptures to Greek thought, and thereby to Greek Christians, who struggled to understand their connection to Jewish history. In particular, Philo taught that allegorical interpretations of the Hebrew scriptures provides access to the real meanings of the texts. Philo also taught the need to bring together the contemplative focus of the Stoics and Essenes with the active lives of virtue and community worship found in Platonism and the Therapeutae. Using terms reminiscent of the Platonists, Philo described the intellectual component of faith as a sort of spiritual ecstasy in which our &quot;nous&quot; (mind) is suspended and God&#x27;s spirit takes its place. Philo&#x27;s ideas influenced the Alexandrian Christians, Clement, and Origen, and through them, Gregory of Nyssa.

===Monasticism===

====Desert Fathers====

Inspired by Christ&#x27;s teaching and example, men and women withdrew to the deserts of Sketes where, either as solitary individuals or communities, they lived lives of austere simplicity oriented towards contemplative prayer. These communities formed the basis for what later would become known as Christian monasticism.

====Early monasticism====
The Eastern church then saw the development of monasticism and the mystical contributions of Gregory of Nyssa, Evagrius Ponticus, and Pseudo-Dionysius. Monasticism, also known as anchoritism (meaning &quot;to withdraw&quot;) was seen as an alternative to martyrdom, and was less about escaping the world than about fighting demons (who were thought to live in the desert) and about gaining liberation from our bodily passions in order to be open to the word of God. Anchorites practiced continuous meditation on the scriptures as a means of climbing the ladder of perfection—a common religious image in the Mediterranean world and one found in Christianity through the story of Jacob&#x27;s ladder—and sought to fend off the demon of &quot;acedia&quot; (&quot;un-caring&quot;), a boredom or apathy that prevents us from continuing on in our spiritual training. Anchorites could live in total solitude (&quot;hermits&quot;, from the word &quot;erēmitēs&quot;, &quot;of the desert&quot;) or in loose communities (&quot;cenobites&quot;, meaning &quot;common life&quot;).

Monasticism eventually made its way to the West and was established by the work of John Cassian and Benedict of Nursia. Meanwhile, Western spiritual writing was deeply influenced by the works of such men as Jerome and Augustine of Hippo.

====Neo-Platonism====
Neo-Platonism has had a profound influence on Christian contemplative traditions. Neoplatonic ideas were adopted by Christianity, among them the idea of &quot;theoria&quot; or contemplation, taken over by Gregory of Nyssa for example. The &quot;Brill Dictionary of Gregory of Nyssa&quot; remarks that contemplation in Gregory is described as a &quot;loving contemplation&quot;, and, according to Thomas Keating, the Greek Fathers of the Church, in taking over from the Neoplatonists the word &quot;theoria&quot;, attached to it the idea expressed by the Hebrew word &quot;da&#x27;ath&quot;, which, though usually translated as &quot;knowledge&quot;, is a much stronger term, since it indicates the experiential knowledge that comes with love and that involves the whole person, not merely the mind. Among the Greek Fathers, Christian &quot;theoria&quot; was not contemplation of Platonic Ideas nor of the astronomical heavens of Pontic Heraclitus, but &quot;studying the Scriptures&quot;, with an emphasis on the spiritual sense.

Later, contemplation came to be distinguished from intellectual life, leading to the identification of θεωρία or &quot;contemplatio&quot; with a form of prayer distinguished from discursive meditation in both East and West. Some make a further distinction, within contemplation, between contemplation acquired by human effort and infused contemplation.

====Mystical theology====
In early Christianity the term &quot;mystikos&quot; referred to three dimensions, which soon became intertwined, namely the biblical, the liturgical and the spiritual or contemplative. The biblical dimension refers to &quot;hidden&quot; or allegorical interpretations of Scriptures. The liturgical dimension refers to the liturgical mystery of the Eucharist, the presence of Christ at the Eucharist. The third dimension is the contemplative or experiential knowledge of God.

The 9th century saw the development of mystical theology through the introduction of the works of sixth-century theologian Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, such as &quot;On Mystical Theology&quot;. His discussion of the &quot;via negativa&quot; was especially influential.

Under the influence of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century) the mystical theology came to denote the investigation of the allegorical truth of the Bible, and &quot;the spiritual awareness of the ineffable Absolute beyond the theology of divine names.&quot; Pseudo-Dionysius&#x27; apophatic theology, or &quot;negative theology&quot;, exerted a great influence on medieval monastic religiosity. It was influenced by Neo-Platonism, and very influential in Eastern Orthodox Christian theology. In western Christianity it was a counter-current to the prevailing Cataphatic theology or &quot;positive theology&quot;.

==Practice==

=== Cataphatic and apophatic mysticism ===
Within theistic mysticism two broad tendencies can be identified. One is a tendency to understand God by asserting what he is and the other by 
asserting what he is not. The former leads to what is called cataphatic theology and the latter to apophatic theology.
# Cataphatic (imaging God, imagination or words) – e.g., The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola, Julian of Norwich, Francis of Assisi; and
# Apophatic (imageless, stillness, and wordlessness) – inspired by the writings of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, which forms the basis of Eastern Orthodox mysticism and hesychasm, and became influential in western Catholic mysticism from the 12th century AD onward, as in The Cloud of Unknowing and Meister Eckhart.

Urban T. Holmes III categorized mystical theology in terms of whether it focuses on illuminating the mind, which Holmes refers to as speculative practice, or the heart/emotions, which he calls affective practice. Combining the speculative/affective scale with the apophatic/cataphatic scale allows for a range of categories:
* Rationalism = Cataphatic and speculative
* Pietism = Cataphatic and affective
* Encratism = Apophatic and speculative
* Quietism = Apophatic and affective

=== Meditation and contemplation ===
In discursive meditation, such as Lectio Divina, mind and imagination and other faculties are actively employed in an effort to understand Christians&#x27; relationship with God. In contemplative prayer, this activity is curtailed, so that contemplation has been described as &quot;a gaze of faith&quot;, &quot;a silent love&quot;. There is no clear-cut boundary between Christian meditation and Christian contemplation, and they sometimes overlap. Meditation serves as a foundation on which the contemplative life stands, the practice by which someone begins the state of contemplation.

John of the Cross described the difference between discursive meditation and contemplation by saying: 
Mattá al-Miskīn, an Oriental Orthodox monk has posited: 
===Threefold path===
According to the standard formulation of the process of Christian perfection, going back to Evagrius Ponticus (345–399 AD) and Dionysius the Pseudo-Areopagite (late 5th to early 6th century), there are three stages:
* &quot;Katharsis&quot; or purification;
* &quot;Theoria&quot; or illumination, also called &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;acquired contemplation;&quot;
* &quot;Union&quot; or &quot;Theosis&quot;; also called &quot;infused&quot; or &quot;higher contemplation&quot;; indwelling in God; vision of God; deification; union with God

The three aspects later became &quot;purgative, illuminative, and unitive&quot; in the western churches and prayer of the lips, the mind, the heart in the eastern churches.

Purification and illumination of the mind are preparations for the vision of God. Without these preparations it is impossible for man&#x27;s selfish love to be transformed into selfless love. This transformation takes place during the higher level of the stage of illumination called theoria, literally meaning vision, in this case vision &quot;by means of unceasing and uninterrupted memory of God&quot;. Those who remain selfish and self-centered with a hardened heart, closed to God&#x27;s love, will not see the glory of God in this life. However, they will see God&#x27;s glory eventually, but as an eternal and consuming fire and outer darkness.

====Catharsis (purification)====
In the Orthodox Churches, theosis results from leading a pure life, practicing restraint and adhering to the commandments, putting the love of God before all else. This metamorphosis (transfiguration) or transformation results from a deep love of God. Saint Isaac the Syrian says in his &quot;Ascetical Homilies&quot; that &quot;Paradise is the love of God, in which the bliss of all the beatitudes is contained,&quot; and that &quot;the tree of life is the love of God&quot; (Homily 72). &quot;Theoria&quot; is thus achieved by the pure of heart who are no longer subject to the afflictions of the passions. It is a gift from the Holy Spirit to those who, through observance of the commandments of God and ascetic practices (see praxis, kenosis, Poustinia and schema), have achieved dispassion.

Purification constitutes a turning away from all that is unclean and unwholesome. This is a purification of mind and body. As preparation for &quot;theoria&quot;, however, the concept of purification in this three-part scheme refers most importantly to the purification of consciousness (&quot;nous&quot;), the faculty of discernment and knowledge (wisdom), whose awakening is essential to coming out of the state of delusion that is characteristic of the worldly-minded. After the &quot;nous&quot; has been cleansed, the faculty of wisdom may then begin to operate more consistently. With a purified &quot;nous&quot;, clear vision and understanding become possible, making one fit for contemplative prayer.

In the Eastern Orthodox ascetic tradition called hesychasm, humility, as a saintly attribute, is called holy wisdom or &quot;Sophia&quot;. Humility is the most critical component to humanity&#x27;s salvation. Following Christ&#x27;s instruction to &quot;go into your room or closet and shut the door and pray to your father who is in secret&quot; (Matthew 6:6), the hesychast withdraws into solitude in order that he or she may enter into a deeper state of contemplative stillness. By means of this stillness, the mind is calmed, and the ability to see reality is enhanced. The practitioner seeks to attain what the apostle Paul called &#x27;unceasing prayer&#x27;.

Some Eastern Orthodox theologians object to what they consider an overly speculative, rationalistic, and insufficiently experiential nature of Roman Catholic theology. and confusion between different aspects of the Trinity.

====Theoria (illumination) – contemplative prayer====

An exercise long used among Christians for acquiring contemplation, one that is &quot;available to everyone, whether he be of the clergy or of any secular occupation&quot;, is that of focusing the mind by constant repetition of a phrase or word. Saint John Cassian recommended using the phrase &quot;O God, make speed to save me: O Lord, make haste to help me&quot;. Another formula for repetition is the name of Jesus, or the Jesus Prayer: &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner,&quot; which has been called &quot;the mantra of the Orthodox Church&quot;, although the term &quot;Jesus Prayer&quot; is not found in the writings of the Fathers of the Church. The author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; recommended use of a monosyllabic word, such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Love&quot;.

==== Contemplative prayer in the Eastern Church ====
In the Eastern Church, noetic prayer is the first stage of &quot;theoria&quot;, the vision of God, which is beyond conceptual knowledge, like the difference between reading about the experience of another, and reading about one&#x27;s own experience. Noetic prayer is the first stage of the Jesus Prayer, a short formulaic prayer: &quot;Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&quot; The second stage of the Jesus Prayer is the &quot;Prayer of the Heart&quot; (), in which the prayer is internalized into &#x27;the heart&#x27;.

The Jesus Prayer, which, for the early Fathers, was just a training for repose, the later Byzantines developed into hesychasm, a spiritual practice of its own, attaching to it technical requirements and various stipulations that became a matter of serious theological controversy. Via the Jesus Prayer, the practice of the Hesychast is seen to cultivate &quot;nepsis&quot;, watchful attention. Sobriety contributes to this mental asceticism that rejects tempting thoughts; it puts a great emphasis on focus and attention. The practitioner of the hesychast is to pay extreme attention to the consciousness of his inner world and to the words of the Jesus Prayer, not letting his mind wander in any way at all. The Jesus Prayer invokes an attitude of humility believed to be essential for the attainment of &quot;theoria&quot;. The Jesus Prayer is also invoked to pacify the passions, as well as the illusions that lead a person to actively express these passions. It is believed that the worldly, neurotic mind is habitually accustomed to seek pleasant sensations and to avoid unpleasant ones. This state of incessant agitation is attributed to the corruption of primordial knowledge and union with God (the fall of man and the defilement and corruption of consciousness, or &quot;nous&quot;). According to St. Theophan the Recluse, though the Jesus Prayer has long been associated with the Prayer of the Heart, they are not synonymous.

==== Contemplative prayer in the Roman Catholic Church ====
Methods of prayer in the Roman Catholic Church include recitation of the Jesus Prayer, which &quot;combines the Christological hymn of with the cry of the publican () and the blind man begging for light (). By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness and the Saviour&#x27;s mercy&quot;; invocation of the holy name of Jesus; recitation, as recommended by Saint John Cassian, of &quot;O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me&quot; or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the Cloud of Unknowing, such as &quot;God&quot; or &quot;Love&quot;; the method used in centering prayer; the use of Lectio Divina. The Congregation for Divine Worship&#x27;s directory of popular piety and the liturgy emphasizes the contemplative characteristic of the Holy Rosary and states that the Rosary is essentially a contemplative prayer which requires &quot;tranquility of rhythm or even a mental lingering which encourages the faithful to meditate on the mysteries of the Lord&#x27;s life.&quot; Pope John Paul II placed the Rosary at the very center of Christian spirituality and called it &quot;among the finest and most praiseworthy traditions of Christian contemplation.&quot;
In modern times, centering prayer, which is also called &quot;Prayer of the heart&quot; and &quot;Prayer of Simplicity,&quot; has been popularized by Thomas Keating, drawing on Hesychasm and the &quot;Cloud of Unknowing&quot;. The practice of contemplative prayer has also been encouraged by the formation of associations like The Julian Meetings and the Fellowship of Meditation.

====Unification====
The third phase, starting with infused or higher contemplation (or Mystical Contemplative Prayer) in the Western tradition, refers to the presence or consciousness of God. This presence or consciousness varies, but it is first and foremost always associated with a reuniting with divine &quot;love&quot;, the underlying theme being that God, the perfect goodness, is known or experienced at least as much by the heart as by the intellect since, in the words 1 John 4:16: &quot;God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him.&quot; Some approaches to classical mysticism would consider the first two phases as preparatory to the third, explicitly mystical experience, but others state that these three phases overlap and intertwine.

In the Orthodox Churches, the highest theoria, the highest consciousness that can be experienced by the whole person, is the vision of God. God is beyond being; He is a hyper-being; God is beyond nothingness. Nothingness is a gulf between God and man. God is the origin of everything, including nothingness. This experience of God in hypostasis shows God&#x27;s essence as incomprehensible, or uncreated. God is the origin, but has no origin; hence, he is apophatic and transcendent in essence or being, and cataphatic in foundational realities, immanence and energies. This ontic or ontological theoria is the observation of God.

A nous in a state of ecstasy or ekstasis, called the eighth day, is not internal or external to the world, outside of time and space; it experiences the infinite and limitless God. &quot;Nous&quot; is the &quot;eye of the soul&quot; (Matthew 6:22–34). Insight into being and becoming (called ) through the intuitive truth called faith, in God (action through faith and love for God), leads to truth through our contemplative faculties. This theory, or speculation, as action in faith and love for God, is then expressed famously as &quot;Beauty shall Save the World&quot;. This expression comes from a mystical or gnosiological perspective, rather than a scientific, philosophical or cultural one.

===Alternate models===

====Augustine====
In the advance to contemplation Augustine spoke of seven stages:
# the first three are merely natural preliminary stages, corresponding to the vegetative, sensitive and rational levels of human life; 
# the fourth stage is that of virtue or purification; 
# the fifth is that of the tranquillity attained by control of the passions; 
# the sixth is entrance into the divine light (the illuminative stage); 
# the seventh is the indwelling or unitive stage that is truly mystical contemplation.

====Meister Eckhart====
Meister Eckhart did not articulate clear-cut stages, yet a number of divisions can be found in his works.

====Teresa of Avila====
According to Jordan Aumann, Saint Teresa of Ávila distinguishes nine grades of prayer:
# vocal prayer, 
# mental prayer or prayer of meditation, 
# affective prayer,
# prayer of simplicity, or acquired contemplation or recollection, 
# infused contemplation or recollection,
# prayer of quiet,
# prayer of union,
# prayer of conforming union, and
# prayer of transforming union.

According to Aumann, &quot;The first four grades belong to the predominantly ascetical stage of spiritual life; the remaining five grades are infused prayer and belong to the mystical phase of spiritual life.&quot; According to Augustin Pulain, for Teresa, ordinary prayer &quot;comprises these four degrees: first, vocal prayer; second, meditation, also called methodical prayer, or prayer of reflection, in which may be included meditative reading; third, affective prayer; fourth, prayer of simplicity, or of simple gaze.&quot;

=====Prayer of simplicity – natural or acquired contemplation=====
For Teresa, in natural or acquired contemplation, also called the prayer of simplicity there is one dominant thought or sentiment which recurs constantly and easily (although with little or no development) amid many other thoughts, beneficial or otherwise. The prayer of simplicity often has a tendency to simplify itself even in respect to its object, leading one to think chiefly of God and of his presence, but in a confused manner. Definitions similar to that of Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori are given by Adolphe Tanquerey (&quot;a simple gaze on God and divine things proceeding from love and tending thereto&quot;) and Saint Francis de Sales (&quot;a loving, simple and permanent attentiveness of the mind to divine things&quot;).

In the words of Saint Alphonsus Maria de Liguori, acquired contemplation &quot;consists in seeing at a simple glance the truths which could previously be discovered only through prolonged discourse&quot;: reasoning is largely replaced by intuition and affections and resolutions, though not absent, are only slightly varied and expressed in a few words. Similarly, Saint Ignatius of Loyola, in his 30-day retreat or Spiritual Exercises beginning in the &quot;second week&quot; with its focus on the life of Jesus, describes less reflection and more simple contemplation on the events of Jesus&#x27; life. These contemplations consist mainly in a simple gaze and include an &quot;application of the senses&quot; to the events, to further one&#x27;s empathy for Jesus&#x27; values, &quot;to love him more and to follow him more closely.&quot;

Natural or acquired contemplation has been compared to the attitude of a mother watching over the cradle of her child: she thinks lovingly of the child without reflection and amid interruptions. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states: 
=====Infused or higher contemplation=====
In the mystical experience of Teresa of Avila, infused or higher contemplation, also called intuitive, passive or extraordinary, is a supernatural gift by which a person&#x27;s mind will become totally centered on God. It is a form of mystical union with God, a union characterized by the fact that it is God, and God only, who manifests himself. Under this influence of God, which assumes the free cooperation of the human will, the intellect receives special insights into things of the spirit, and the affections are extraordinarily animated with divine love. This union that it entails may be linked with manifestations of a created object, as, for example, visions of the humanity of Christ or an angel or revelations of a future event, etc. They include miraculous bodily phenomena sometimes observed in ecstatics.

In Teresa&#x27;s mysticism, infused contemplation is described as a &quot;divinely originated, general, non-conceptual, loving awareness of God&quot;. According to Dubay:
According to Thomas Dubay, infused contemplation is the normal, ordinary development of discursive prayer (mental prayer, meditative prayer), which it gradually replaces. Dubay considers infused contemplation as common only among &quot;those who try to live the whole Gospel wholeheartedly and who engage in an earnest prayer life&quot;. Other writers view contemplative prayer in its infused supernatural form as far from common. John Baptist Scaramelli, reacting in the 17th century against quietism, taught that asceticism and mysticism are two distinct paths to perfection, the former being the normal, ordinary end of the Christian life, and the latter something extraordinary and very rare. Jordan Aumann considered that this idea of the two paths was &quot;an innovation in spiritual theology and a departure from the traditional Catholic teaching&quot;. And Jacques Maritain proposed that one should not say that every mystic necessarily enjoys habitual infused contemplation in the mystical state, since the gifts of the Holy Spirit are not limited to intellectual operations.

=====Mystical union=====
According to Charles G. Herbermann, in the Catholic Encyclopedia (1908), Teresa of Avila described four degrees or stages of mystical union: 
# incomplete mystical union, or the prayer of quiet or supernatural recollection, when the action of God is not strong enough to prevent distractions, and the imagination still retains a certain liberty;
# full or semi-ecstatic union, when the strength of the divine action keeps the person fully occupied but the senses continue to act, so that by making an effort, the person can cease from prayer;
# ecstatic union, or ecstasy, when communications with the external world are severed or nearly so, and one can no longer at will move from that state; and
# transforming or deifying union, or spiritual marriage (properly) of the soul with God.
The first three are weak, medium, and the energetic states of the same grace.

=====The Prayer of Quiet=====
For Teresa of Avila, the Prayer of Quiet is a state in which the soul experiences an extraordinary peace and rest, accompanied by delight or pleasure in contemplating God as present. The Prayer of Quiet is also discussed in the writings of Francis de Sales, Thomas Merton and others.

====Evelyn Underhill====
Author and mystic Evelyn Underhill recognizes two additional phases to the mystical path. First comes the awakening, the stage in which one begins to have some consciousness of absolute or divine reality. Purgation and illumination are followed by a fourth stage which Underhill, borrowing the language of St. John of the Cross, calls the dark night of the soul. This stage, experienced by the few, is one of final and complete purification and is marked by confusion, helplessness, stagnation of the will, and a sense of the withdrawal of God&#x27;s presence. This dark night of the soul is not, in Underhill&#x27;s conception, the Divine Darkness of the pseudo-Dionysius and German Christian mysticism. It is the period of final &quot;unselfing&quot; and the surrender to the hidden purposes of the divine will. Her fifth and final stage is union with the object of love, the one Reality, God. Here the self has been permanently established on a transcendental level and liberated for a new purpose.

==Eastern Orthodox Christianity==
Eastern Christianity has preserved a mystical emphasis in its theology and retains in hesychasm a tradition of mystical prayer dating back to Christianity&#x27;s beginnings. Hesychasm concerns a spiritual transformation of the egoic self, the following of a path designed to produce more fully realized human persons, &quot;created in the Image and Likeness of God&quot; and as such, living in harmonious communion with God, the Church, the rest of the world, and all creation, including oneself. The Eastern Christian tradition speaks of this transformation in terms of theosis or divinization, perhaps best summed up by an ancient aphorism usually attributed to Athanasius of Alexandria: &quot;God became human so that man might become god.&quot;

According to John Romanides, in the teachings of Eastern Orthodox Christianity the quintessential purpose and goal of the Christian life is to attain &quot;theosis&quot; or &#x27;deification&#x27;, understood as &#x27;likeness to&#x27; or &#x27;union with&#x27; God. &quot;Theosis&quot; is expressed as &quot;Being, union with God&quot; and having a relationship or synergy between God and man. God &quot;is&quot; the Kingdom of Heaven.

&quot;Theosis&quot; or unity with God is obtained by engaging in contemplative prayer, the first stage of &quot;theoria&quot;, which results from the cultivation of watchfulness (Gk: &quot;nepsis&quot;). In &quot;theoria&quot;, one comes to see or &quot;behold&quot; God or &quot;uncreated light,&quot; a grace which is &quot;uncreated.&quot; In the Eastern Christian traditions, theoria is the most critical component needed for a person to be considered a theologian; however it is not necessary for one&#x27;s salvation. An experience of God is necessary to the spiritual and mental health of every created thing, including human beings. Knowledge of God is not intellectual, but existential. According to eastern theologian Andrew Louth, the purpose of theology as a science is to prepare for contemplation, rather than theology being the purpose of contemplation.

&quot;Theoria&quot; is the main aim of hesychasm, which has its roots in the contemplative practices taught by Evagrius Ponticus (345–399), John Climacus (6th–7th century), Maximus the Confessor (c. 580–662), and Symeon the New Theologian (949–1022). John Climacus, in his influential &quot;Ladder of Divine Ascent&quot;, describes several stages of contemplative or hesychast practice, culminating in &quot;agape&quot;. Symeon believed that direct experience gave monks the authority to preach and give absolution of sins, without the need for formal ordination. While Church authorities also taught from a speculative and philosophical perspective, Symeon taught from his own direct mystical experience, and met with strong resistance for his charismatic approach, and his support of individual direct experience of God&#x27;s grace. According to John Romanides, this difference in teachings on the possibility to experience God or the uncreated light is at the very heart of many theological conflicts between Eastern Orthodox Christianity and Western Christianity, which is seen to culminate in the conflict over hesychasm.

According to John Romanides, following Vladimir Lossky in his interpretation of St. Gregory Palamas, the teaching that God is transcendent (incomprehensible in ousia, essence or being), has led in the West to the (mis)understanding that God cannot be experienced in this life. Romanides states that Western theology is more dependent upon logic and reason, culminating in scholasticism used to validate truth and the existence of God, than upon establishing a relationship with God (theosis and theoria).

===False spiritual knowledge===
In the Orthodox Churches, theoria is regarded to lead to true spiritual knowledge, in contrast to the false or incomplete knowledge of rational thought, c.q. conjecture, speculation, &quot;dianoia&quot;, &quot;stochastic&quot; and dialectics). After illumination or theoria, humanity is in union with God and can properly discern, or have holy wisdom. Hence theoria, the experience or vision of God, silences all humanity.

The most common false spiritual knowledge is derived not from an experience of God, but from reading another person&#x27;s experience of God and subsequently arriving at one&#x27;s own conclusions, believing those conclusions to be indistinguishable from the actual experienced knowledge.

False spiritual knowledge can also be , generated from an evil rather than a holy source. The gift of the knowledge of good and evil is then required, which is given by God. Humanity, in its finite existence as created beings or creatures, can never, by its own accord, arrive at a sufficiently objective consciousness. Theosis is the gradual submission of a person to the good, who then with divine grace from the person&#x27;s relationship or union with God, attains deification. Illumination restores humanity to that state of faith existent in God, called &quot;&quot;, before humanity&#x27;s consciousness and reality was changed by their fall.

====Spiritual somnolence====
In the orthodox Churches, false spiritual knowledge is regarded as leading to spiritual delusion (Russian prelest, Greek plani), which is the opposite of sobriety. Sobriety (called nepsis) means full consciousness and self-realization (enstasis), giving true spiritual knowledge (called true gnosis). Prelest or plani is the estrangement of the person to existence or objective reality, an alienation called . This includes damaging or vilifying the nous, or simply having a non-functioning noetic and neptic faculty.

Evil is, by definition, the act of turning humanity against its creator and existence. Misotheism, a hatred of God, is a catalyst that separates humanity from nature, or vilifies the realities of ontology, the spiritual world and the natural or material world. Reconciliation between God (the uncreated) and man is reached through submission in faith to God the eternal, i.e. transcendence rather than transgression (magic).

The Trinity as Nous, Word and Spirit (hypostasis) is, ontologically, the basis of humanity&#x27;s being or existence. The Trinity is the creator of humanity&#x27;s being via each component of humanity&#x27;s existence: origin as nous (ex nihilo), inner experience or spiritual experience, and physical experience, which is exemplified by Christ (logos or the uncreated prototype of the highest ideal) and his saints. The following of false knowledge is marked by the symptom of somnolence or &quot;awake sleep&quot; and, later, psychosis. Theoria is opposed to allegorical or symbolic interpretations of church traditions.

====False asceticism or cults====
In the Orthodox practice, once the stage of true discernment (diakrisis) is reached (called phronema), one is able to distinguish false gnosis from valid gnosis and has holy wisdom. The highest holy wisdom, Sophia, or Hagia Sophia, is cultivated by humility or meekness, akin to that personified by the Theotokos and all of the saints that came after her and Christ, collectively referred to as the ecclesia or church. This community of unbroken witnesses is the Orthodox Church.

Wisdom is cultivated by humility (emptying of oneself) and remembrance of death against thymos (ego, greed and selfishness) and the passions. Vlachos of Nafpaktos wrote: 
 Practicing asceticism is being dead to the passions and the ego, collectively known as the world.

God is beyond knowledge and the fallen human mind, and, as such, can only be experienced in his hypostases through faith (noetically). False ascetism leads not to reconciliation with God and existence, but toward a false existence based on rebellion to existence.

==Latin Catholic mysticism==
===&quot;Contemplatio&quot;===
In the Latin Church terms derived from the Latin word &quot;contemplatio&quot; such as, in English, &quot;contemplation&quot; are generally used in languages largely derived from Latin, rather than the Greek term &quot;theoria&quot;. The equivalence of the Latin and Greek terms was noted by John Cassian, whose writings influenced the whole of Western monasticism, in his &quot;Conferences&quot;. However, Catholic writers do sometimes use the Greek term.

===Middle ages===
The Early Middle Ages in the West includes the work of Gregory the Great and Bede, as well as developments in Celtic Christianity and Anglo-Saxon Christianity, and comes to fulfillment in the work of Johannes Scotus Eriugena and the Carolingian Renaissance.

The High Middle Ages saw a flourishing of mystical practice and theorization corresponding to the flourishing of new monastic orders, with such figures as Guigo II, Hildegard of Bingen, Bernard of Clairvaux, the Victorines, all coming from different orders, as well as the first real flowering of popular piety among the laypeople.

The Late Middle Ages saw the clash between the Dominican and Franciscan schools of thought, which was also a conflict between two different mystical theologies: on the one hand that of Dominic de Guzmán and on the other that of Francis of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, Bonaventure, Jacopone da Todi, Angela of Foligno. Moreover, there was the growth of groups of mystics centered on geographic regions: the Beguines, such as Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hadewijch (among others); the Rhenish-Flemish mystics Meister Eckhart, Johannes Tauler, Henry Suso, and John of Ruysbroeck; and the English mystics Richard Rolle, Walter Hilton and Julian of Norwich. This period also saw such individuals as Catherine of Siena and Catherine of Genoa, the &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot;, and such books as the &quot;Theologia Germanica&quot;, &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot; and &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;.

===Counter-reformation===
The Reformation brought about the Counter-Reformation and, with it, a new flowering of mystical literature, often grouped by nationality.

====Spanish mysticism====
The Spanish had Ignatius Loyola, whose &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; were designed to open people to a receptive mode of consciousness in which they can experience God through careful spiritual direction and through understanding how the mind connects to the will and how to weather the experiences of spiritual consolation and desolation; Teresa of Ávila, who used the metaphors of watering a garden and walking through the rooms of a castle to explain how meditation leads to union with God; and John of the Cross, who used a wide range of biblical and spiritual influences both to rewrite the traditional &quot;three ways&quot; of mysticism after the manner of bridal mysticism and to present the two &quot;dark nights&quot;: the dark night of the senses and the dark night of the soul, during which the individual renounces everything that might become an obstacle between the soul and God and then experiences the pain of feeling separated from God, unable to carry on normal spiritual exercises, as it encounters the enormous gap between its human nature and God&#x27;s divine wisdom and light and moves up the 10-step ladder of ascent towards God. Another prominent mystic was Miguel de Molinos, the chief apostle of the religious revival known as Quietism. No breath of suspicion arose against Molinos until 1681, when the Jesuit preacher Paolo Segneri, attacked his views, though without mentioning his name, in his &quot;Concordia tra la fatica e la quiete nell&#x27; orazione&quot;. The matter was referred to the Inquisition. A report got abroad that Molinos had been convicted of moral enormities, as well as of heretical doctrines; and it was seen that he was doomed. On September 3, 1687 he made public profession of his errors, and was sentenced to imprisonment for life. Contemporary Protestants saw in the fate of Molinos nothing more than a persecution by the Jesuits of a wise and enlightened man, who had dared to withstand the petty ceremonialism of the Italian piety of the day. Molinos died in prison in 1696 or 1697.

====Italy====
Lorenzo Scupoli, from Otranto in Apulia, was an Italian mystic best known for authoring &quot;The Spiritual Combat&quot;, a key work in Catholic mysticism.

====France====

French mystics included Francis de Sales, Jeanne Guyon, François Fénelon, Brother Lawrence and Blaise Pascal.

==Protestant mysticism==

===Reformation===
The Protestant Reformation downplayed mysticism, although it still produced a fair amount of spiritual literature. Even the most active reformers can be linked to Medieval mystical traditions. Martin Luther, for instance, was a monk who was influenced by the German Dominican mystical tradition of Eckhart and Tauler as well by the Dionysian-influenced &quot;Wesenmystik&quot; (&quot;essence mysticism&quot;) tradition. He also published the &quot;Theologia Germanica&quot;, which he claimed was the most important book after the Bible and Augustine for teaching him about God, Christ, and humanity. Even John Calvin, who rejected many Medieval ascetic practices and who favored doctrinal knowledge of God over affective experience, has Medieval influences, namely, Jean Gerson and the &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot;, with its emphasis on piety as the method of spiritual growth in which the individual practices dependence on God by imitating Christ and the son-father relationship. Meanwhile, his notion that we can begin to enjoy our eternal salvation through our earthly successes leads in later generations to &quot;a mysticism of consolation&quot;.
Nevertheless, Protestantism was not devoid of mystics. Several leaders of the Radical Reformation had mystical leanings such as Caspar Schwenckfeld and Sebastian Franck. The Magisterial traditions also produced mystics, notably Peter Sterry (Calvinist) and Johann Arndt (Lutheran). An original thinker, formally in the Lutheran tradition but a forerunner of Christian theosophy, was Jakob Böhme.

As part of the Protestant Reformation, theologians turned away from the traditions developed in the Middle Ages and returned to what they consider to be biblical and early Christian practices. Accordingly, they were often skeptical of Catholic mystical practices, which seemed to them to downplay the role of grace in redemption and to support the idea that human works can play a role in salvation. Thus, Protestant theology developed a strong critical attitude, oftentimes even an animosity towards Christian mysticism. However, Quakers, Anglicans, Methodists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Local Churches, Pentecostals, Adventists, and Charismatics have in various ways remained open to the idea of mystical experiences.

====England====
The English had a denominational mix, from Catholic Augustine Baker and Julian of Norwich (the first woman to write in English), to Anglicans William Law, John Donne, and Lancelot Andrewes, to Puritans Richard Baxter and John Bunyan (&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;), to the first &quot;Quaker&quot;, George Fox and the first &quot;Methodist&quot;, John Wesley, who was well-versed in the continental mystics.

An example of &quot;scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the Church of England&quot;is seen in the work of Sir Thomas Browne, a Norwich physician and scientist whose thought often meanders into mystical realms, as in his self-portrait, &quot;Religio Medici&quot;, and in the &quot;mystical mathematics&quot; of &quot;The Garden of Cyrus&quot;, whose full running title reads, &quot;Or, The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the ancients, Naturally, Artificially, Mystically considered&quot;. Browne&#x27;s highly original and dense symbolism frequently involves scientific, medical, or optical imagery to illustrate a religious or spiritual truth, often to striking effect, notably in &quot;Religio Medici&quot;, but also in his posthumous advisory &quot;Christian Morals&quot;.

Browne&#x27;s latitudinarian Anglicanism, hermetic inclinations, and Montaigne-like self-analysis on the enigmas, idiosyncrasies, and devoutness of his own personality and soul, along with his observations upon the relationship between science and faith, are on display in &quot;Religio Medici&quot;. His spiritual testament and psychological self-portrait thematically structured upon the Christian virtues of Faith, Hope and Charity, also reveal him as &quot;one of the immortal spirits waiting to introduce the reader to his own unique and intense experience of reality&quot;. Though his work is difficult and rarely read, he remains, paradoxically, one of England&#x27;s perennial, yet first, &quot;scientific&quot; mystics.

====Germany====
Similarly, well-versed in the mystic tradition was the German Johann Arndt, who, along with the English Puritans, influenced such continental Pietists as Philipp Jakob Spener, Gottfried Arnold, Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf of the Moravians, and the hymnodist Gerhard Tersteegen. Arndt, whose book &quot;True Christianity&quot; was popular among Protestants, Catholics and Anglicans alike, combined influences from Bernard of Clairvaux, John Tauler and the &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot; into a spirituality that focused its attention away from the theological squabbles of contemporary Lutheranism and onto the development of the &quot;new life&quot; in the heart and mind of the believer. Arndt influenced Spener, who formed a group known as the &quot;collegia pietatis&quot; (&quot;college of piety&quot;) that stressed the role of spiritual direction among lay-people—a practice with a long tradition going back to Aelred of Rievaulx and known in Spener&#x27;s own time from the work of Francis de Sales. Pietism as known through Spener&#x27;s formation of it tended not just to reject the theological debates of the time, but to reject both intellectualism and organized religious practice in favor of a personalized, sentimentalized spirituality.

====Pietism====
This sentimental, anti-intellectual form of pietism is seen in the thought and teaching of Zinzendorf, founder of the Moravians; but more intellectually rigorous forms of pietism are seen in the teachings of John Wesley, which were themselves influenced by Zinzendorf, and in the teachings of American preachers Jonathan Edwards, who restored to pietism Gerson&#x27;s focus on obedience and borrowed from early church teachers Origen and Gregory of Nyssa the notion that humans yearn for God, and John Woolman, who combined a mystical view of the world with a deep concern for social issues; like Wesley, Woolman was influenced by Jakob Böhme, William Law and &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;. The combination of pietistic devotion and mystical experiences that are found in Woolman and Wesley are also found in their Dutch contemporary Tersteegen, who brings back the notion of the &quot;nous&quot; (&quot;mind&quot;) as the site of God&#x27;s interaction with our souls; through the work of the Spirit, our mind is able to intuitively recognize the immediate presence of God in our midst.

==Scientific research==
Fifteen Carmelite nuns allowed scientists to scan their brains with fMRI while they were meditating, in a state known as Unio Mystica or &quot;Theoria&quot;. The results showed that multiple regions of the brain were activated when they considered themselves to be in mystical union with God. These regions included the right medial orbitofrontal cortex, right middle temporal cortex, right inferior and superior parietal lobules, caudate, left medial prefrontal cortex, left anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior parietal lobule, left insula, left caudate, left brainstem, and extra-striate visual cortex.

== Modern philosophy ==
In modern times &quot;theoria&quot; is sometimes treated as distinct from the meaning given to it in Christianity, linking the word not with contemplation but with speculation. Boethius (–524 or 525) translated the Greek word &quot;theoria&quot; into Latin, not as &quot;contemplatio&quot; but as &quot;speculatio&quot;, and &quot;theoria&quot; is taken to mean speculative philosophy. A distinction is made, more radical than in ancient philosophy, between &quot;theoria&quot; and &quot;praxis&quot;, theory and practice.

Another significant mystical experience was in 1537, at a chapel in La Storta, outside Rome, in which he saw God the Father place him with the Son, who was carrying the Cross. This was after he had spent a year praying to Mary for her to place him with her Son (Jesus), and was one of the reasons why he insisted that the group that followed his &#x27;way of proceeding&#x27; be called the Society of Jesus.

<text>The Mark 48 and its improved Advanced Capability (ADCAP) variant are American heavyweight submarine-launched torpedoes. They were designed to sink deep-diving nuclear-powered submarines and high-performance surface ships.

==History==
The Mark 48 was initially developed as REsearch TORpedo Concept II (RETORC II), one of several weapons recommended for implementation by Project Nobska, a 1956 summer study on submarine warfare. The Mk-48 torpedo was designed at the end of the 1960s to keep up with the advances in Soviet submarine technology. Operational since 1972, it replaced the Mk-37, Mk-14 and Mk-16 torpedoes as the principal weapon of U.S. Navy submarines. With the entry into service of the new Soviet in 1977, the decision was made to accelerate the ADCAP program, which would bring significant modifications to the torpedo. Tests were run to ensure that the weapon could keep up with the developments and the weapon was modified with improved acoustics and electronics. The new version of the weapon, also known as Mk-48 Mod 5, was extensively tested and production started in 1985, with entry into service in 1988. From then on, various upgrades have been added to the torpedo. the Mk-48 Mod 6 was in service; a Mod 7 version was test fired in 2008 in Exercise RIMPAC. The inventory of the U.S. Navy in 2001 was 1,046 Mk-48 torpedoes. In 2017 Lockheed&#x27;s production was approximately 50 per year.

==Deployment==
The Mk-48 torpedo is designed to be launched from submarine torpedo tubes. The weapon is carried by all U.S. Navy submarines, including ballistic missile submarines and -, -, and attack submarines. It is also used on Canadian, Australian, and Dutch submarines.

Mk-48 and Mk-48 ADCAP torpedoes can be guided from a submarine by wires attached to the torpedo. They can also use their own active or passive sensors to execute programmed target search, acquisition, and attack procedures. The torpedo is designed to detonate under the keel of a surface ship, breaking the keel and destroying its structural integrity. In the event of a miss, it can circle back for another attempt.

==Propulsion==
The swashplate piston engine is fueled by Otto fuel II, a monopropellant which combusts to drive the engine. The thrust is generated by a propulsor assembly.

==Sensors and improvements==
The torpedo&#x27;s seeker has an active electronically steered &quot;pinger&quot; (2D phased array sonar) that helps avoid having to maneuver as it approaches the target. Unconfirmed reports indicate that the torpedo&#x27;s sensors can monitor surrounding electrical and magnetic fields. This may refer to the electromagnetic coils on the warhead (at least from 1977 to 1981), used to sense the metallic mass of the ship&#x27;s hull and detonate at the proper stand-off distance.

The torpedo has been the subject of continued improvement over its service lifetime. 
In the 1990s, a Mod 6 variant of the ADCAP provided much improved noise isolation for the engine, which makes this torpedo more difficult to detect for a potential target.

The Mk48 Mod 7 Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS) torpedo is optimized for both the deep and littoral waters and has advanced counter-countermeasure capabilities. The MK48 ADCAP Mod 7 (CBASS) torpedo is the result of a Joint Development Program with the Royal Australian Navy and reached Initial Operational Capability in 2006. The modular Mod 7 variant increases sonar bandwidth, enabling it to transmit and receive pings over a wider frequency band, taking advantage of broadband signal processing techniques to greatly improve search, acquisition, and attack effectiveness. This version is much more resistant to enemy countermeasures.

On July 25, 2008 a MK 48 Mod 7 CBASS torpedo fired by an Australian , , successfully sank a test target during the Rim of the Pacific 2008 (RIMPAC) exercises.

In 2015 the USN announced plans to restart production and seek a more modular design. Lockheed Martin is to upgrade existing Mark 48s to include a new guidance-control system known as the Common Broadband Advanced Sonar System (CBASS), in addition to improving propulsion and resistance to electronic countermeasures.

Starting in 2003, the US Navy began the Stealth Torpedo Enhancement Program which aims to upgrade the capability of the existing Mk 48 design by implementing alternative fuel sources including electric fuel cells, and a &quot;swim out&quot; capability, a capability that allows a torpedo to leave the tube under its own power without using a torpedo tube&#x27;s noisier compressed air-launch system. The program is ongoing, with many details yet classified.

<text>Kennedy Chu () is a Taiwanese singer, songwriter, actor, cook; and a member of Taiwanese Mandopop vocal quartet boy band F4. Educated in Singapore (Boon Lay Secondary School), he speaks Mandarin, Cantonese and English.

==Biography==
Chu was working as a waiter in Taiwan when he was discovered by Cai Zhiping, the creator of the boy band F4. He started in showbiz working as a part-time as an assistant for some artists, then acting in several idol series successfully which pushed him to the center of the stage. He starred in the TV series, &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;, its supplementary mini-series, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot;, and its sequel, &quot;Meteor Garden II&quot;. He was the lead in &quot;Sky of Love&quot; (2003) and &quot;Tokyo Trial&quot; (2006).

In January 2005, he released his debut solo album, &quot;On Ken&#x27;s Time&quot;. The tracks &quot;永不停止&quot; (Never Stopping) and &quot;La La La&quot; were nominated for &quot;Top 10 Gold Songs&quot; at the Hong Kong TVB8 Awards, presented by television station TVB8, in 2005.

He also released a cookbook, Mei Wei Guan Xi (Delicious Relations) on January 5, 2006. It was released in China on July 4, 2006, and four months later in Japan. Chu is now focusing on his solo acting career and has a huge fan base in Asia.

On February 24 and 25, 2007, he held his first solo concert in Japan, titled 2007 [I-KEN] 1st Concert at the Tokyo International Forum Hall A with an unplugged theme. December 2007, Chu starred alongside Iza Calzado in Philippine production movie &quot;&quot; of Ignite Media Films, directed by Adolf Alix.

<text>The Mark 46 torpedo is the backbone of the United States Navy&#x27;s lightweight anti-submarine warfare torpedo inventory and is the NATO standard. These aerial torpedoes are designed to attack high-performance submarines. In 1989, an improvement program for the Mod 5 to the Mod 5A and Mod 5A(S) increased its shallow-water performance. The Mark 46 was initially developed as Research Torpedo Concept I (RETORC I), one of several weapons recommended for implementation by Project Nobska, a 1956 summer study on submarine warfare.

==Design details==
=== Variants ===
* Mod 0: One of the original versions of 1960 (production started 1963). Solid propellent piston engine. Gyro/wire guidance with passive/active homing.
* Mod 1: Based on Mod 0. 1967. Uses liquid Otto fuel piston engine. Laminar search guidance. Phase 1 of 1968 uses stronger hull to resist deeper waters. Phase 2 of 1971 uses a new homing program able to detect submarines near the surface.
* Mod 2: Based on Mod 1 phase 2. More powerful Mk 103 Mod 1 warhead. Improved computer with snake search pattern capability. Known to have been captured by China in 1978.
* Mod 4: Version for use as Mark 60 CAPTOR mine payload.
* Mod 5: 1979 upgrade kit for Mod 2, also known as NEARTIP (near-term improvement program). New passive/active sonar, liquid fuel and two speed engine for low speed search and high speed attack.
** Mod 5A: Cheapter NEARTIP upgrade kit for Mod 1 and Mod 2 with improved shallow-water performance. 1980s.
** Mod 5A(S): Variant of 5A that allows use in water as shallow as 40 m.
** Mod 5A(SW): Latest variant from 1996 Service Life Extension Program. Boasts improved counter-countermeasure performance, enhanced target acquisition, provides a bottom-avoidance preset, and improved maintainability and reliability.
* Mod 6: Version for Mark 60 CAPTOR, with some NEARTIP components.
* Mod 7: Cancelled. Not funded by Congress.

For most variants there is also an inert REXTORP (recoverable exercise torpedo) version.

<text>The Mark 50 torpedo is a U.S. Navy advanced lightweight torpedo for use against fast, deep-diving submarines. The Mk 50 can be launched from all anti-submarine aircraft and from torpedo tubes aboard surface combatant ships. The Mk 50 was intended to replace the Mk 46 as the fleet&#x27;s lightweight torpedo. Instead the Mark 46 will be replaced with the Mark 54 LHT.

== Propulsion system ==
The torpedo&#x27;s stored chemical energy propulsion system uses a small tank of sulfur hexafluoride gas, which is sprayed over a block of solid lithium, which generates enormous quantities of heat, which generates steam. The steam propels the torpedo in a closed Rankine cycle, supplying power to a pump-jet. This propulsion system offers the very important deep-water performance advantage in that the combustion products—sulfur and lithium fluoride—occupy less volume than the reactants, so the torpedo does not have to force these out against increasing water pressure as it approaches a deep-diving submarine.

<doc id="612928" wikidata="Q841685" url="?curid=612928" title="PuTTY">
<text>PuTTY () is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection. It can also connect to a serial port. The name &quot;PuTTY&quot; has no official meaning.

PuTTY was originally written for Microsoft Windows, but it has been ported to various other operating systems. Official ports are available for some Unix-like platforms, with work-in-progress ports to and , and unofficial ports have been contributed to platforms such as Symbian, Windows Mobile and Windows Phone.

PuTTY was written and is maintained primarily by Simon Tatham, a British programmer.

==Features==
PuTTY supports many variations on the secure remote terminal, and provides user control over the SSH encryption key and protocol version, alternate ciphers such as AES, 3DES, RC4, Blowfish, DES, and public-key authentication. PuTTY uses its own format of key files – PPK (protected by &quot;Message Authentication Code&quot;). PuTTY supports SSO through GSSAPI, including user provided GSSAPI DLLs. It also can emulate control sequences from xterm, VT220, VT102 or ECMA-48 terminal emulation, and allows local, remote, or dynamic port forwarding with SSH (including X11 forwarding). The network communication layer supports IPv6, and the SSH protocol supports the zlib@openssh.com delayed compression scheme. It can also be used with local serial port connections.

PuTTY comes bundled with command-line SCP and SFTP clients, called &quot;pscp&quot; and &quot;psftp&quot; respectively, and plink, a command-line connection tool, used for non-interactive sessions.

PuTTY does not support session tabs directly, but many wrappers are available that do.

==History==
PuTTY development began late in 1998, and was a usable SSH-2 client by October 2000.

==Components==
PuTTY consists of several components:
; PuTTY: the Telnet, rlogin, and SSH client itself, which can also connect to a serial port
; PSCP: an SCP client, i.e. command-line secure file copy. Can also use SFTP to perform transfers
; PSFTP: an SFTP client, i.e. general file transfer sessions much like FTP
; PuTTYtel: a Telnet-only client
; Plink: a command-line interface to the PuTTY back ends. Usually used for SSH Tunneling
; Pageant: an SSH authentication agent for PuTTY, PSCP and Plink
; PuTTYgen: an RSA, DSA, ECDSA and EdDSA key generation utility
; pterm: (Unix version only) an X11 client which supports the same terminal emulation as PuTTY

<text>Old Yeller is a 1956 children&#x27;s novel written by Fred Gipson and illustrated by Carl Burger. It received a Newbery Honor in 1957. In 1957, Walt Disney released a film adaptation starring Tommy Kirk, Fess Parker, Dorothy McGuire, Kevin Corcoran, Jeff York, Chuck Connors, and Beverly Washburn.

==Plot==
Travis Coates has been working to take care of his family ranch in the late 1860s in the fictional town of Salt Licks, Texas, with his mother and younger brother Arliss, while his father goes off on a cattle drive. A &quot;dingy yellow&quot; dog comes to the family and Travis reluctantly takes it in; they name him Old Yeller. The name has a double meaning: the fur color yellow pronounced as &quot;yeller&quot;, and the fact that its bark sounds more like a human yell.

Travis initially loathes the &quot;rascal&quot; and at first tries to get rid of it, but the dog eventually proves his worth, saving the family on several occasions: rescuing Arliss from a bear, Travis from a bunch of wild hogs, and Mama and their friend Lisbeth from a wolf. Travis grows to love Old Yeller, and they become great friends. The rightful owner of Yeller shows up looking for his dog. He recognizes that the family has become attached to Yeller, so he trades the dog to Arliss for a horned toad and a home-cooked meal prepared by Travis&#x27; mother.

Old Yeller is bitten while saving his family from a rabid wolf. Travis cannot risk Old Yeller becoming rabid and turning on the family, and has to kill the dog. Old Yeller had puppies, and one of them helps Travis get over Old Yeller&#x27;s death. They take in the new dog and try to make a fresh start.

== Breed ==
Old Yeller in the novel is described as being a &quot;yellow cur&quot;. It has been claimed that the dog was actually modeled after the Yellow or Southern Black Mouth Cur or a Blue Lacy, the state dog of Texas. In the Disney film adaptation Yeller was portrayed by a yellow Labrador Retriever/Mastiff mix.

==Other books in the series==
The new puppy becomes the title character of the follow-up book &quot;Savage Sam&quot; (1962) and 1963 film adaptation. A third book, &quot;Little Arliss&quot; (1978), is set after the first two and features Travis&#x27; younger brother.

==Awards and honors==
* 1957 Newbery Honor
* 1959 William Allen White Children&#x27;s Book Award
* 1959 Young Reader&#x27;s Choice Award
* 1959 Sequoyah Book Award, Children&#x27;s category (inaugural winner)

A supplementary mini-series called &quot;Meteor Rain&quot; was produced in August 2001 and the sequel &quot;Meteor Garden II&quot; was broadcast from November to December 2002.

== Reception ==

=== In the Philippines ===
The Tagalog-dubbed version of Meteor Garden aired on ABS-CBN on May 5, 2003, quickly becoming one of the highest-rated shows on local television and creating a massive following in the country dubbed &quot;The &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; fever&quot; in Philippine media.

Its popularity spawned numerous local parodies of F4 music videos and notable scenes from the series and prompted broadcasters to re-air the series in its entirety at least eight times. The show&#x27;s opening and closing themes were translated and performed in Tagalog by Josh Santana (for &quot;Qing Fei De Yi&quot;) and Michelle Ayalde (for &quot;Ni Yao De Ai&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

On September 12, 2003, Barbie Hsu, Ken Chu and Vaness Wu visited Manila for a concert at the ULTRA indoor arena (now known as the PhilSports Arena.)&quot;&quot; To prevent the actors, specifically Chu and Wu, from being mobbed by fans, the management of ABS-CBN and airport security staff used decoy actors wearing wigs escorted by a security detail to &quot;meet&quot; the estimated 700 fans while the real actors went through the routine immigration and customs inspections with other regular passengers.

On November 6, 2003, Ninoy Aquino International Airport was placed on high alert in anticipation of Jerry Yan&#x27;s first visit to Manila. Yan paid a courtesy call to then-president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo at the Malacañang Palace where, according to reports, both the president and Yan had to be temporarily removed from the premises for a few minutes when fans became unruly during a scheduled photo session.

&quot;Meteor Garden&quot; has been credited for directly boosting the popularity of other &quot;Asianovelas&quot; in the Philippines, with live-action dramas produced in Taiwan, China, Korea and Japan allotted regular timeslots on major television networks after the initial run of &quot;Meteor Garden&quot;.

Following the show&#x27;s 10th anniversary in the Philippines, the show had re-runs on ABS-CBN and Jeepney TV on March 31, 2014.

Following the death of Barbie Hsu (the actress who played Shancai) who died because of pneumonia on February 2, 2025. The show will have a second re-run on Kapamilya Channel (pay TV only) and its partnered free-to-air block timers on Jesus Is Lord Church Worldwide owned ZOE Broadcasting Network through A2Z and the MediaQuest Holdings owned TV5 on March 10, 2025.

==Legacy==
===F4 and JVKV===
F4 (Flower Four) or JVKV was a Taiwanese boy band consisting of Jerry Yan, Vanness Wu, Ken Chu, and Vic Chou. The group F4 was formed in 2001 after &quot;Meteor Garden&quot; ended. They released three albums, &quot;Meteor Rain&quot; (2001), &quot;Fantasy 4ever&quot; (2002), and &quot;Waiting for You&quot; (2007). According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, F4 has sold 3.5 million copies of their first two albums all over Asia as of July 2003. In 2007, due to copyright issues, the group changed its name to JVKV, using the initials of its members in order of descending age.

<doc id="612944" wikidata="Q352319" url="?curid=612944" title="Tim Hardaway">
<text>Timothy Duane Hardaway Sr. (born September 1, 1966) is an American former professional basketball player. Hardaway played in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Golden State Warriors, Miami Heat, Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Indiana Pacers. He was a five-time NBA All-Star and a five-time All-NBA Team member. Hardaway won a gold medal with the United States national basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics. He was known for his crossover dribble which was dubbed the &quot;UTEP two-step&quot; by television analysts. In 2022 Hardaway was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

He is the father of NBA player Tim Hardaway Jr..

==Early life==
Hardaway was born in Chicago, Illinois, and he graduated from Carver Area High School in 1985.

==College career==
Hardaway played college basketball for the UTEP Miners under head coach Don Haskins, a future member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

Hardaway was twice named MVP of El Paso&#x27;s Sun Bowl Invitational Tournament, in 1987 and 1988. He played on teams that went to the NCAA Tournaments from 1986 to 1989. He won the Frances Pomeroy Naismith Award in 1989 as the best college player in the nation six feet (1.83 m) tall or under. While playing for the Miners, Hardaway developed his crossover dribble move that was called the &quot;UTEP two-step&quot;.

==Professional career==
=== Golden State Warriors (1989–1996) ===
Hardaway was selected as the 14th overall pick of the 1989 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors. In his rookie season, Hardaway wore number &quot;5&quot; on his jersey, as Manute Bol wore Hardaway&#x27;s &quot;10&quot;. After Bol left the Warriors, Hardaway acquired the number. Hardaway, Mitch Richmond, and Chris Mullin formed a trio known as Run TMC (the initials of the players&#x27; first names and a play on the name of the popular rap group Run-DMC). As part of the Warriors&#x27; attack, Hardaway was responsible for leading Run TMC&#x27;s fast break, displaying his excellent passing and one-on-one skills to complement Richmond&#x27;s slashing and Mullin&#x27;s shooting.

Golden State made the playoffs during the 1990–91 season, Hardaway&#x27;s second season and his first season in the playoffs. In the first round, the 7th seeded Warriors defeated the 2nd seeded San Antonio Spurs led by All-Star David Robinson in 4 games to advance to face the 3rd seeded Los Angeles Lakers led by NBA legend Magic Johnson. The Warriors managed to steal a game on the road in game 2, but could not defeat the more experienced Lakers, falling in five games despite Hardaway averaging 26.8 points, 12.8 assists and 3.8 steals for the series.

Hardaway averaged a career-high 23.4 points a game in the 1991–92 season, as the Warriors fell in the first round of the playoffs to the Seattle SuperSonics. The following season Hardaway averaged a career-high 10.6 assists a game to get with his scoring average of 21.5, but the Warriors did not make the playoffs and would not return to postseason action for the remainder of Hardaway&#x27;s tenure with the team.

As a Warrior, Hardaway made the NBA All-Star Game three straight years, and a knee injury kept him out of the entire 1993–94 season. He reached 5,000 points and 2,500 assists faster than any other NBA player except Oscar Robertson. Hardaway played for the Warriors until the middle of 1995–96 season when he was traded to the Miami Heat along with Chris Gatling in exchange for Kevin Willis and Bimbo Coles.

=== Miami Heat (1996–2001) ===
Following the mid-season trade to Miami, Hardaway started 28 games to finish the season, averaging 17.2 points a game with 10 assists. Miami made the playoffs but were swept in the first round by the 72 win Chicago Bulls. The following season was a huge success for Miami and for Hardaway, as he finished 4th in voting for the NBA Most Valuable Player Award, was selected to the All-NBA First Team as Miami won a franchise record 61 wins.

Hardaway started in 81 games, averaging 20.3 points, 8.6 assists, while placing fourth in the league with 203 three-point baskets. He also played in the 1997 NBA All-Star Game, scoring 10 points in 14 minutes. In the playoffs, Hardaway averaged 26 points a game as the Heat defeated the Orlando Magic in the first round in 5 games, and then defeated the New York Knicks in 7 games in the semifinals, in which Hardaway scored 38 points in the 7th game. Miami would once again fall to the defending champion Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in 5 games.

In the 1997–98 season, Hardaway averaged 18.9 points and 8.3 assist per game, and was selected to play in the 1998 NBA All-Star Game. The Heat won 55 games and won the Atlantic Division, but lost to the Knicks in 5 games in the first round of the playoffs. In the lockout shortened 1998–99 season, he averaged 17.4 points a game with 7.3 assists, and Miami won the Atlantic Division again but could once again not defeat the Knicks in the first round of the playoffs despite having home court advantage and the Knicks being the 8th seed in the playoffs.

Hardaway&#x27;s production slipped in the 1999–2000 season, with Alonzo Mourning and Jamal Mashburn carrying more of the offensive load. Hardaway averaged 13.4 points with 7.4 assists a game, but shot a personal best .367 percent from beyond the three-point arc. After playing just 52 games, Hardaway was further limited in the playoffs, as Miami defeated the Detroit Pistons but once again fell to New York in 7 games.

That summer, Hardaway and Mourning won a gold medal playing for the U.S.A. men&#x27;s basketball team at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Before the 2000–01 season Mourning would be diagnosed with a rare kidney disease, and would be sidelined for much of the season. Hardaway upped his offensive production to 14.9 points a game with 6.3 assists a game as Miami won 50 games and captured the East&#x27;s third best record, only to be swept in the first round by the Charlotte Hornets.

=== Dallas Mavericks (2001–2002) ===
Following the 2000–01 season, and with his skills declining with age, Hardaway was traded to the Dallas Mavericks on August 22, 2001, for a second-round draft pick. He was at one time Miami&#x27;s all-time leader in assists. With Dallas, Hardaway was mainly utilized off the bench, starting only two games out of 54 and averaging almost ten points a game. In the middle of the season, he was traded to the Denver Nuggets in exchange for point guard Nick Van Exel.

===Denver Nuggets (2002)===
With the Nuggets he started all 14 games he played with them before retiring and becoming a basketball analyst for ESPN.

While playing for the Nuggets, Hardaway was suspended for two games and fined $10,000 by the league when he threw a television monitor onto the court.

===Indiana Pacers (2003)===
On March 27, 2003, Hardaway signed a contract with the Indiana Pacers, and in his first game registered a season-high 14 points and seven assists against the Chicago Bulls. By the end of his career, Hardaway competed in five NBA All-Star Games.

==Coaching career==

=== Detroit Pistons (2014–2018) ===
On August 7, 2014, Hardaway was announced as an assistant coach for the Detroit Pistons.

==Achievements==

Hardaway was the 1989 WAC Player of the Year. He recorded 5,000 points and 2,500 assists, second fastest in NBA history after Oscar Robertson. Hardaway accomplished it in 262 games; Robertson took only 247. He held the record for most assists in Miami Heat franchise history with 1,947, until his total was surpassed by Dwyane Wade on January 16, 2010.

Hardaway shares the record for second most steals in an NBA playoffs game, with 8 in Game 2 of the 1991 Western Conference Semifinals against the Los Angeles Lakers and in Game 4 of the 1992 Western Conference First Round against the Seattle SuperSonics. In 1991–92, Hardaway became the 7th player in NBA history to average 20 points (23.4 ppg) and 10 assists (10.0 apg) in a season, a feat he accomplished again in 1992–93 (21.5 ppg, 10.6 apg).

Hardaway holds the NBA record for the worst single-game shooting performance in NBA history, going 0-for-17 in a 106–102 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves on December 27, 1991. Hardaway holds the Miami Heat&#x27;s all-time record in 3-point field goals made, with 806. His number 10 was retired by the Miami Heat on October 28, 2009. On April 2, 2022, Hardaway was announced as one of thirteen members to be inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame for the Class of 2022 later this year.

==National team career==

Hardaway was originally selected to play for &quot;Dream Team II&quot; in the 1994 FIBA World Championship but was replaced after suffering a torn knee ligament.

He was also selected (as one of the last two players selected) for the 1998 FIBA World Championship team. The team was later replaced with CBA and college players due to the NBA lockout.

In 2000, he played in the Sydney Olympics, scoring 5.5 points/Game and shooting .385 (15–39) from the field.

Hardaway was a player/head coach of the Florida Pit Bulls of the ABA in 2006.

In September 2009, he played for the NBA Generations team in the 2009 NBA Asia Challenge, a series of exhibitions against Korean Basketball League and Philippine Basketball Association players.

==Personal life==
Hardaway and his wife Yolanda reside in Michigan. They have a son, Tim Jr., and daughters, Nia and Nina. Tim Jr. was drafted by the New York Knicks in 2013, and currently plays for the Detroit Pistons.

===Controversial comments===
During a February 14, 2007 interview on Miami&#x27;s &quot;The Dan Le Batard Show&quot;, in response to the coming out of former NBA player John Amaechi, Hardaway remarked that he would try to distance himself from a player he knew was homosexual. When asked by the radio show host whether he realized that his remarks were homophobic, Hardaway responded by saying: &quot;Well, you know I hate gay people, so I let it be known. I don&#x27;t like gay people and I don&#x27;t like to be around gay people. I am homophobic. I don&#x27;t like it. It shouldn&#x27;t be in the world or in the United States.&quot; He also said that if he found out he had one or more gay teammates, he would try to get them fired.

Later in the day, Hardaway apologized for the remarks during a telephone interview with Fox affiliate WSVN in Miami. &quot;I&#x27;m sorry. I shouldn&#x27;t have said I hate gay people or anything like that.&quot; He further apologized on February 15 in a statement released by his agent.

On the same day, the NBA responded to Hardaway&#x27;s comments by removing him from its All-Star Weekend activities later that week. His employer, Trinity Sports, owner of the Anderson-based CBA Indiana Alley Cats, dismissed him from his position as Chief Basketball Operations Advisor, and the CBA issued a statement distancing itself from Hardaway&#x27;s remarks.

In a September 2007 interview, Hardaway spoke about his February comments, saying he &quot;had no idea how much I hurt people. A lot of people.&quot; He described the controversy as &quot;the biggest bump [in the road] in my life&quot;, and added, &quot;I&#x27;m going to do whatever I can to correct it. That&#x27;s all I can do.&quot;

In an interview on February 11, 2010, on Hardcore Sports Radio on Sirius, Hardaway spoke about his recent work with The Trevor Project and The YES Institute, which he had done to educate himself on LGBT issues.

In April 2013, when Jason Collins came out as the first active openly gay male player in a major American professional team sport, Collins said that Hardaway called him in support of his homosexuality. In July 2013, Hardaway was the symbolic first signer of a petition to put a proposed amendment to the Florida State Constitution overturning Florida Amendment 2 and allowing same-sex marriage in his home state of Florida on the ballot in 2014.

<text>Aššur (; AN.ŠAR2KI, Assyrian cuneiform: &quot;Aš-šurKI&quot;, &quot;City of God Aššur&quot;; &quot;Āšūr&quot;; &quot;Aθur&quot;, &quot;Āšūr&quot;; &#x27;, ), also known asAshurandQal&#x27;at Sherqat, was the capital of the Old Assyrian city-state (2025–1364 BC), the Middle Assyrian Empire (1363–912 BC), and for a time, of the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911–609 BC). The remains of the city lie on the western bank of the Tigris River, north of the confluence with its tributary, the Little Zab, in what is now Iraq, more precisely in the al-Shirqat District of the Saladin Governorate.

Occupation of the city itself continued for approximately 3,000 years, from the Early Dynastic Period to the mid-3rd century AD, when the city was sacked by the Sasanian Empire. The site is a World Heritage Site and was added to that organisation&#x27;s list of sites in danger in 2003 as a result of a proposed dam, which would flood some of the site. It has been further threatened by the conflict that erupted following the US-led 2003 invasion of Iraq. Assur lies south of the site of Nimrud and 100 km (60 mi) south of Nineveh.

==History of research==
Exploration of the site of Assur began in 1898 by German archaeologists. Excavations began in 1900 by Friedrich Delitzsch, and were continued in 1903–1913 by a team from the Deutsche Orient-Gesellschaft led initially by Robert Koldewey and later by Walter Andrae. More than 16,000 clay tablets with cuneiform texts were discovered. The German archeologists brought objects they found to Berlin enhancing the collection of the Pergamon Museum.

More recently, Ashur was excavated by B. Hrouda for the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and the Bavarian Ministry of Culture in 1990. During the same period, in 1988 and 1989, the site was being worked by R. Dittmann on behalf of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.

==Name==

&quot;&quot; is the name of the city, of the land ruled by the city, and of its tutelary deity from which the natives took their name, as did the entire nation of Assyria which encompassed what is today northern Iraq, north east Syria and south east Turkey. Today the Assyrians are still found throughout the Middle East, particularly in Iraq, Iran, Syria, Turkey, and the Diaspora in the western world. Assur is also the origin of the names Syria and terms for Syriac Christians, these being originally Indo-European derivations of Assyria, and for many centuries applying only to Assyria and the Assyrians (see Etymology of Syria) before also being applied to the Levant and its inhabitants by the Seleucid Empire in the 3rd century BC.

==History==

===Early Bronze Age===
According to the Oxford Companion to the Bible, Assur was &quot;built on a sandstone cliff on the west bank of the Tigris about 35 km (24 mi) north of its confluence with the lower Zab River&quot;. Archaeology reveals the site of the city was occupied by the middle of the 3rd millennium BC. This was still the Sumerian period, before Assyria emerged. The oldest remains of the city were discovered in the foundations of the Ishtar temple, as well as at the Old Palace. In the subsequent period, the city was ruled by kings from the Akkadian Empire. During the Third Dynasty of Ur, the city was ruled by Assyrian governors subject to the Sumerians.

===Old and Middle Assyrian Periods===
By the time the Neo-Sumerian Ur-III dynasty collapsed at the hands of the Elamites around the end of the 21st century BC according to the Middle Chronology and mid-20th century according to the Short Chronology following increasing raids by Gutians and Amorites. The native Akkadian-speaking Assyrian kings were now free while Sumer fell under the yoke of the Amorites. The historically unverified king Ushpia is credited with dedicating the first temple of the god Ashur in his home city, although this comes from a later inscription from Shalmaneser I in the 13th century.

In around 2000 BC, Puzur-Ashur I founded a new dynasty, with his successors such as Ilushuma, Erishum I and Sargon I leaving inscriptions regarding the building of temples to Ashur, Adad and Ishtar in the city. Prosperity and independence produced the first significant fortifications in this period. As the region enjoyed relative peace and stability, trade between Mesopotamia and Anatolia increased, and the city of Ashur greatly benefited from its strategic location. Merchants would dispatch their merchandise via caravan into Anatolia and trade primarily at Assyrian colonies in Anatolia, the primary one being at Karum Kanesh (Kültepe).

Shamshi-Adad I&#x27;s (1813–1781 BC), Amorite ruler of the Kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia, conquered Assur and made it his religious capital (his primary capital being Ekallatum and later Shubat-Enlil). In this era, the Great Royal Palace was built, and the temple of Assur was expanded and enlarged with a ziggurat. However, this empire met its end when Hammurabi, the Amorite king of Babylon conquered and incorporated the city into the First Babylonian dynasty empire following the death of Ishme-Dagan I around 1756 BC, while the next three Assyrian kings were viewed as vassals of Babylon.

Not long after, the native king Adasi expelled the Babylonians and Amorites from Assur and Assyria as a whole around 1720 BC, although little is known of his successors. Evidence of further building activity is known from a few centuries later, during the reign of a native king Puzur-Ashur III, when the city was refortified and the southern districts incorporated into the main city defenses. Temples to the moon god Sin (Nanna) and the sun god Shamash were built and dedicated through the 15th century BC. The city was subsequently subjugated by the king of Mitanni, Shaushtatar in the late 15th century, taking the gold and silver doors of the temple to his capital, Washukanni, as spoils.

Ashur-uballit I emulated his ancestor Adasi and overthrew the Mitanni empire in 1365 BC. The Assyrians reaped the benefits of this triumph by taking control of the eastern portion of the Mitanni Empire, and later also annexing Hittite, Babylonian, Amorite and Hurrian territory. The following centuries witnessed the restoration of the old temples and palaces of Assur, and the city once more became the throne of an empire from 1365 BC to 1076 BC. Tukulti-Ninurta I (1244–1208 BC) also constructed a new temple to the goddess Ishtar. The Anu-Adad temple was established later during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser I (1115–1075 BC). The walled area of the city in the Middle Assyrian period made up some .

===Neo-Assyrian Empire===

In the Neo-Assyrian Empire (912–605 BC), the royal residence was transferred to other Assyrian cities. Ashur-nasir-pal II (884–859 BC) moved the capital from Assur to Kalhu (Calah/Nimrud) following a series of successful campaigns and produced some of the greatest artworks in the form of colossal lamassu statues and low-relief depictions of the royal court as well as battles. 

With the reign of Sargon II (722–705 BC), a new capital began to rise: Dur-Sharrukin (Fortress of Sargon). Dur-Sharrukin was originally planned to be built on a scale set to surpass that of Ashurnasirpal&#x27;s. He died in battle and his son and successor Sennacherib (705–682 BC) abandoned the city, choosing to magnify Nineveh as his royal capital. The city of Ashur remained the religious center of the empire and continued to be revered as the holy crown of the empire, due to its temple of the national god Ashur.

In the reign of Sennacherib (705–682 BC), the House of the New Year, &quot;Akitu&quot;, was built, and the festivities celebrated in the city. Many of the kings were also buried beneath the Old Palace while some queens were buried in the other capitals such as the wife of Sargon, Ataliya. The city was sacked and largely destroyed during the decisive battle of Assur, a major confrontation between the Assyrian and Median armies.

===Achaemenid Empire===
After the Medes were overthrown by the Persians as the dominant force in ancient Iran, Assyria was ruled by the Persian Achaemenid Empire (as Athura) from 549 BC to 330 BC (see Achaemenid Assyria). The Assyrians of Mada (Media) and Athura (Assyria) had been responsible for gold and glazing works of the palace and for providing Lebanese cedar timber, respectively. The city and region of Ashur had once more gained a degree of militaristic and economic strength. Along with the Assyrians in Mada, a revolt took place in 520 BC but ultimately failed. Assyria seems to have recovered dramatically, and flourished during this period. It became a major agricultural and administrative centre of the Achaemenid Empire, and its soldiers were a mainstay of the Persian Army.

===Parthian Empire===

The city revived during the Parthian Empire period, particularly between 150 BC and 270 AD, its population expanding and it becoming an administrative centre of Parthian-ruled Assuristan. Assyriologists Simo Parpola and Patricia Crone suggest Assur may have had outright independence in this period. New administrative buildings were erected to the north of the old city, and a palace to the south. The old temple dedicated to the national god of the Assyrians Assur (Ashur) was rebuilt, as were temples to other Assyrian gods.

Assyrian Eastern Aramaic inscriptions from the remains of Ashur have yielded insight into the Parthian-era city with Assyria having its own Mesopotamian Aramaic Syriac script, which was the same in terms of grammar and syntax as that found at Edessa and elsewhere in the state of Osroene.

German semiticist Klaus Beyer (1929-2014) published over 600 inscriptions from Mesopotamian towns and cities including Ashur, Dura-Europos, Hatra, Gaddala, Tikrit and Tur Abdin. Given that Christianity had begun to spread amongst the Assyrians throughout the Parthian era, the original Assyrian culture and religion persisted for some time, as proven by the inscriptions that include invocations to the gods Ashur, Nergal, Nanna, Ishtar, Tammuz and Shamash, as well as mentions of citizens having compound names that refer to Assyrian gods, such as ʾAssur-ḥēl (Ashur [is] my strength), ʾAssur-emar (Ashur decreed/commanded), ʾAssur-ntan (Ashur gave [a son]), and ʾAssur-šma&#x27; (Ashur has heard; cf. Esarhaddon).

The Roman historian Festus wrote in about 370 that in AD 116 Trajan formed from his conquests east of the Euphrates the new Roman provinces of Mesopotamia and Assyria. The existence of the latter Roman province is questioned by C.S. Lightfoot and F. Miller. In any case, just two years after the province&#x27;s supposed creation, Trajan&#x27;s successor Hadrian restored Trajan&#x27;s eastern conquests to the Parthians, preferring to live with him in peace and friendship.
There were later Roman incursions into Mesopotamia under Lucius Verus and under Septimius Severus, who set up the Roman provinces of Mesopotamia and the Neo-Assyrian kingdom of Osroene.

Assur was captured and sacked by Ardashir I of the Sasanian Empire 240 AD, whereafter the city was largely destroyed and much of its population was dispersed.

==Threats to Assur==
The site was put on UNESCO&#x27;s List of World Heritage in Danger in 2003, at which time the site was threatened by a looming large-scale dam project that would have submerged the ancient archaeological site. The dam project was put on hold shortly after the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

The territory around the ancient site was occupied by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) in 2015. Since ISIL had destroyed a number of ancient historical sites, including the cities of Hatra, Khorsabad, and Nimrud, fears rose that Assur would be destroyed too. According to some sources, the citadel of Assur was destroyed or badly damaged in May 2015 by members of ISIL using improvised explosive devices. An AP report from December 2016 after the Iraqi forces had retaken the area, said that the militants tried to destroy the city&#x27;s grand entrance arches, but they remained standing and a local historian described the damage as &quot;minor&quot;.

As of February 2023, a German archaeological team from Munich has resumed work at Assur. The work is focusing on the New City.

<text>The  (; ) is the highest prize awarded to the director of the Best Feature Film of the Official Competition at the Cannes Film Festival. It was introduced in 1955 by the festival&#x27;s organizing committee. Previously, from 1939 to 1954, the festival&#x27;s highest prize was the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film. In 1964, the was replaced again by the Grand Prix, before being reintroduced in 1975.

The is widely considered one of the film industry&#x27;s most prestigious awards.

== History ==

In 1954, the festival decided to present an award annually, titled the Grand Prix of the International Film Festival, with a new design each year from a contemporary artist. The festival&#x27;s board of directors invited several jewellers to submit designs for a palm, in tribute to the coat of arms of the city of Cannes, evoking the famous legend of Saint Honorat and the palm trees lining the famous Promenade de la Croisette. The original design by Parisian jeweller Lucienne Lazon, inspired by a sketch by director Jean Cocteau, had the bevelled lower extremity of the stem forming a heart, and the pedestal a sculpture in terracotta by the artist Sébastien.

In 1955, the first was awarded to Delbert Mann for his film &quot;Marty&quot;. From 1964 to 1974, the festival temporarily resumed a Grand Prix. In 1975, the was reintroduced and has since remained the festival&#x27;s symbol, awarded each year to the director of the winning film, presented in a case of pure red Morocco leather lined with white suede.

As of 2023, Jane Campion, Julia Ducournau, and Justine Triet are the only female directors to have won the (for &quot;The Piano&quot;, &quot;Titane&quot;, and &quot;Anatomy of a Fall&quot;, respectively). However, Bodil Ipsen won the Grand Prix du Festival International du Film for &quot;The Red Meadows&quot; (along with Lau Lauritzen Jr.) as part of an 11-way tie at the inaugural 1946 festival. 

Additionally, in 2013, when &quot;Blue Is the Warmest Color&quot; won the , the jury headed by Steven Spielberg awarded it to the film&#x27;s actresses Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux, as well as the director Abdellatif Kechiche. This remains the only instance where multiple trophies were presented. The jury decided to include the actresses in the recognition due to a Cannes policy that forbids the -winning film from receiving any additional awards. This policy would have prevented the jury from acknowledging the actresses separately. Regarding the unorthodox decision, Spielberg commented, &quot;Had the casting been 3% wrong, [the film] wouldn&#x27;t have worked like it did for us&quot;. Subsequently, Kechiche auctioned off his trophy to fund his new feature film. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, he expressed dissatisfaction with the festival&#x27;s decision to award multiple trophies, stating that he felt they had &quot;publicly insulted&quot; him. He added, &quot;Liberating myself from this Palme d&#x27;Or is a way of washing my hands of this sorry affair&quot;.

Since its reintroduction, the prize has been redesigned several times. At the beginning of the 1980s, the rounded shape of the pedestal, bearing the palm has gradually transformed to become pyramidal in 1984. In 1992, Thierry de Bourqueney redesigned the Palme and its pedestal in hand-cut crystal. In 1997, Caroline Scheufele redesigned the statuette; since then, it has been manufactured by the Swiss jewellery firm Chopard. The palm is made from of 18-carat yellow gold while the branch&#x27;s base forms a small heart. The rests on a dainty crystal cushion shaped like an emerald-cut diamond. A single piece of cut crystal forms a cushion for the palm, which is hand-cast into a wax mould and now presented in a case of blue Morocco leather. In 1998, Theo Angelopoulos was the first director to win the as it appears today, for his film &quot;Eternity and a Day&quot;.

The presentation of the 2014 to &quot;Winter Sleep&quot;, a Turkish film by Nuri Bilge Ceylan, occurred during the 100th anniversary year of Turkish cinema. On receiving the award, Ceylan dedicated it to the &quot;young people&quot; involved in Turkey&#x27;s ongoing political unrest, and the workers killed in the Soma mine disaster, which occurred on the day before the commencement of the awards event.

In 2017, the award was redesigned to celebrate the festival&#x27;s 70th anniversary. The diamonds were provided by an ethical supplier certified by the Responsible Jewellery Council.

The 2020 Cannes Film Festival was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 56 films were announced as official selections by the festival, but no awards were presented.

<text>Human rights in [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003–present|post-invasion Iraq]] have been a subject of concern and controversy since the 2003 U.S. invasion. Issues have been raised regarding the conduct of insurgents, U.S.-led coalition forces, and the Iraqi government. The United States is investigating several allegations of violations of international and domestic standards of conduct in isolated incidents involving its forces and contractors. Similarly, the United Kingdom is conducting investigations into alleged human rights abuses by its forces. War crime tribunals and criminal prosecutions for numerous crimes committed by insurgents are likely still years away. In late February 2009, the U.S. State Department released a report on the human rights situation in Iraq, reflecting on developments during the previous year (2008).
==Human rights abuses by insurgents==


Human rights abuses carried out or alleged to have been carried out by Iraq-based insurgents and/or terrorists include:

===August 2003===
The bombing of the U.N. headquarters in Baghdad in August 2003 resulted in the death of the top U.N. representative in Iraq, 55-year-old Sérgio Vieira de Mello, a Brazilian diplomat who also served as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. The attack claimed the lives of 22 U.N. staff members and injured more than 100 others. Among the dead was Nadia Younes, a former Executive Director at the World Health Organization (WHO) in charge of External Relations and Governing Bodies. The terrorist attack was strongly condemned by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and denounced by the U.N. Security Council.

===June 2004===
South Korean translator Kim Sun-il was beheaded by followers of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.

===July 2004===
Tawhid and Jihad killed Bulgarian truck drivers Ivaylo Kepov and Georgi Lazov. Al-Jazeera aired a videotape of the incident but stated that the segment showing the actual killings was too graphic to broadcast.

===December 2004===
Salvatore Santoro, a 52-year-old Italian photographer, was beheaded in a video. The Islamic Movement of Iraqi Mujahedeen claimed responsibility for the act.
===February 2005===
Al-Iraqiya TV (Iraq) aired transcripts of confessions by Syrian intelligence officer Anas Ahmad Al-Issa and Iraqi terrorist Shihab Al-Sab&#x27;awi. The confessions detailed their involvement in booby-trap operations, explosions, kidnappings, assassinations, and training for beheadings in Syria.

===July 2005===
Egyptian and Algerian envoys.

*Two Algerian diplomats, Ali Belaroussi and Azzedine Belkadi, were reported to have been killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group issued a statement online claiming responsibility, stating: “The court of al-Qaeda in Iraq has decided to carry out God’s verdict against the two diplomats from the apostate Algerian government ... and ordered to kill them.” The statement was signed by Abu Maysara al-Iraqi, the al-Qaeda spokesman.
*An Egyptian diplomat, Al-Sherif, was reported to have been killed by al-Qaeda in Iraq. The group posted a statement on a web forum claiming responsibility for the killing. Top Sunni cleric Mohamed Sayed Tantawi condemned the act, describing it as &quot;a crime against religion, morality, and humanity, as well as a crime that goes against honor and chivalry.&quot;

===February 2006===
The Al Askari Mosque bombing took place on February 22, 2006, at approximately 6:55 am local time (0355 UTC) at the Al Askari Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi&#x27;a Islam, in the Iraqi city of Samarra, about northwest of Baghdad. Although no injuries were reported from the blast itself, the bombing led to violence in the following days. On February 23, over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found, and at least 165 people are believed to have been killed.

===June 2006===
A video showing the killing of four Russian diplomats kidnapped in Iraq was posted on the Internet. The group called the Mujahideen Shura Council released the hostage video.
===July 2006===
Anba&#x27; Al-Iraq News Agency and the Writers Without Borders Organization condemned the imprisonment of its staff member, Husain E. Khadir, who was responsible for covering documentaries about the threats posed by the Kurdistan Federal Region to its neighboring countries. A delegation from Human Rights Watch (HRW) released reports on torture in Iraq, as well as the repression of human rights and freedom of expression. HRW interviewed several detained writers and journalists to document these violations. Mr. Khadir was first detained in Kirkuk and later moved to Erbil, where HRW visited him in one of the detention centers.

The previous year in Baghdad, Khadir faced even worse conditions when he escaped from a Shi&#x27;a militia that had seized his house and thrown his family into the streets, an act seen as a serious threat to his life. Such actions are commonly directed at human rights activists, journalists, and writers who criticize the Iraqi government and the Shi&#x27;a coalition party. During the constitution-writing process, several press and media agencies strongly criticized the Iraqi Shi&#x27;a Coalition. Khadir led a campaign to amend the constitution, advocating for a document that would serve as a peace-building tool, bringing all parties together for national consensus and social cohesion, rather than merely serving as a state-building instrument, as the ruling party frequently stated.

UNAMI commented that most of these civil society activities were supported by UN agencies, international donors, or the U.S. and British governments. The IRIN/UN news agency revealed that journalists and writers are among the most vulnerable victims of killing, threats, kidnapping, torture, and detention, practices commonly carried out by uncontrolled Iraqi forces, paramilitary organizations, and Shi&#x27;a or Sunni militias. This situation, similar to Khadir&#x27;s case, is spreading across southern, central, and northern Iraq.

The number of journalists and writers killed in Iraq has exceeded 220 this year, according to the Iraqi Organization for Supporting Journalists, as reported to IRIN.

U.S. National Guard Sergeant Frank &quot;Greg&quot; Ford claimed to have witnessed human rights violations in Samarra, Iraq. However, a subsequent Army investigation found Ford&#x27;s allegations to be unfounded. Additionally, Ford was discovered to have worn unauthorized &quot;U.S. Navy SEAL&quot; insignia on his Army uniform, despite having never been a Navy SEAL, a claim he had made for many years while serving in the Army National Guard.

*The Kuwaiti News Agency reported that a high-ranking Iraqi security source in the Interior Ministry confirmed the final death toll of the 13 August bombings in the Al-Zafaraniyah district in southern Baghdad was 57 killed and 145 injured, most of them women and children. Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki blamed Sunni extremists for seeking to escalate the conflict.

==Human rights abuses by coalition forces==

===Prison and interrogation abuses by coalition forces===

===April 2003===
On April 29, 2003, an Iraqi man, Ather Karen al-Mowafakia, was shot and killed by a British soldier at a roadside checkpoint. Witnesses alleged that he was shot in the abdomen after the door of his car struck a soldier&#x27;s leg as he was getting out of the vehicle. They further claimed he was then dragged from the car and beaten by the soldier&#x27;s comrades, later succumbing to his injuries in the hospital. Despite seven attempts by &quot;The Guardian&quot; to address the incident, the UK Ministry of Defence (MOD) has refused to explain why the individuals were detained or provide details on where, how, or why they died.

===May 2003===
In May 2003, Saeed Shabram and his cousin, Menem Akaili, were detained by British troops and thrown into a river near Basra. Akaili survived, but Shabram drowned. According to Akaili, the two were approached by a British patrol, led at gunpoint to a jetty, and forced into the water. The act, referred to as &quot;wetting,&quot; was reportedly used to humiliate local youths suspected of looting.

&quot;Wetting was supposed to humiliate those suspected of being petty criminals,&quot; said Sapna Malik, the family&#x27;s lawyer from Leigh Day and Co. &quot;Although the Ministry of Defence (MOD) denies the existence of a policy of wetting to deal with suspected looters at the time, evidence we have seen suggests otherwise. The tactics employed by the MOD appeared to include throwing or placing suspected looters into either of Basra&#x27;s two main waterways.&quot;

Iraqi bystanders rescued Akaili, but Shabram disappeared. His body was later recovered by a diver hired by his father, Radhi Shabram, after a four-hour search while his mother waited on the riverbank. &quot;When Saeed&#x27;s corpse was finally pulled from the river, Radhi described it as bloated and covered with marks and bruises,&quot; Malik added.

Although the MOD paid compensation to Shabram&#x27;s family, none of the soldiers involved were charged in connection with his death.

Ahmed Jabbar Kareem Ali, a 15-year-old boy, was on his way to work with his brother on May 8, 2003, when he was assaulted by a group of British soldiers. The soldiers beat him and then forced him into a canal at gunpoint to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot; for suspected looting. Weakened from the beating, Ali struggled in the water and drowned. His lifeless body was later pulled from the canal.

In a separate case involving the death of another Iragi teenager, four British soldiers were acquitted of manslaughter.

===August 2003===
Hanan Saleh Matrud, an eight-year-old Iraqi girl, was killed on August 21, 2003, by a soldier from the King&#x27;s Regiment when a Warrior armoured vehicle stopped near an alley leading to her home. Three or four soldiers exited the vehicle, attracting a group of children, including Hanan. Accounts of what happened next differ.

The soldiers claimed they came under attack from a mob throwing stones, prompting a &quot;warning shot&quot; to be fired. However, local witnesses alleged that the crowd consisted only of children, who had been &quot;coaxed into the open by the soldiers&#x27; offers of chocolate.&quot; Hanan was shot in the lower torso and rushed by the soldiers to a Czech-run hospital, where she died the following day after an unsuccessful operation.

According to the Ministry of Defence (MOD), &quot;in the absence of impartial witness evidence or forensic evidence to suggest a soldier had acted outside the rules of engagement, no crime was established.&quot; In May 2004, following an intervention by Amnesty International, Hanan&#x27;s family submitted a formal claim for proper compensation, which was under assessment by the MOD as of that time.

===September 2003===
On September 14, Baha Mousa, a 26-year-old hotel receptionist, was arrested along with six other men and taken to a British military base. While in detention, Mousa and the other captives were hooded, severely beaten, and assaulted by several soldiers at the base. Two days later, Mousa was found dead. 

A post-mortem examination revealed that Mousa had sustained multiple injuries—at least 93—including fractured ribs and a broken nose, which were identified as contributing factors to his death.

Seven members of the Queen&#x27;s Lancashire Regiment were tried on charges related to the ill-treatment of detainees, including war crimes under the International Criminal Court Act 2001. On September 19, 2006, Corporal Donald Payne pleaded guilty to a charge of inhumane treatment of persons, making him the first member of the British Armed Forces to plead guilty to a war crime. He was subsequently sentenced to one year in prison and expelled from the army.

The BBC reported that the six other soldiers were cleared of any wrongdoing. &quot;The&quot; &quot;Independent&quot; stated that the charges against them had been dropped, with the presiding judge, Justice Ronald McKinnon, noting: &quot;None of those soldiers has been charged with any offence, simply because there is no evidence against them as a result of a more or less obvious closing of ranks.&quot;

===January 2004===
On January 1, Ghanem Kadhem Kati, an unarmed young man, was shot twice in the back by a British soldier at the door of his home. Troops had arrived at the scene after hearing gunfire, which neighbors reported was coming from a wedding party. 

Six weeks later, investigators from the Royal Military Police exhumed the teenager&#x27;s body. However, no compensation has been offered, and the inquiry&#x27;s conclusion has yet to be announced.

Video footage from the gun camera of a U.S. Apache helicopter in Iraq, showing the killing of suspected Iraqi insurgents, was aired on ABC TV. The case sparked controversy due to the ambiguity of the video. In the footage, a cylindrical object is tossed on the ground in a field. The U.S. military identified the object as an RPG or mortar tube and subsequently fired upon the individuals.

However, &quot;IndyMedia UK&quot; suggested that the objects might have been harmless tools or implements. The publication also alleged that the helicopter fired upon a man who appeared to be wounded, which they argued would contradict international laws.

Retired U.S. Army General Robert Gard stated on German television that, in his opinion, the killings were &quot;inexcusable murders.&quot;

===April 2004===
On April 14, Lieutenant Ilario Pantano of the United States Marine Corps killed two unarmed captives. Pantano claimed that the captives had advanced on him in a threatening manner. The officer presiding over his Article 32 hearing recommended a court-martial for &quot;body desecration.&quot; However, all charges against Pantano were dropped due to a lack of credible evidence or testimony. He later separated from the Marine Corps with an honorable discharge.

In February 2006, a video showing a group of British soldiers apparently beating several Iraqi teenagers was posted on the internet and soon broadcast on major television networks worldwide. The video, filmed in April 2004, was taken from an upper storey of a building in the southern Iraqi town of Al-Amarah. It shows a crowd of Iraqis outside a coalition compound.

After an altercation in which members of the crowd reportedly threw rocks and an improvised grenade at the soldiers, the soldiers rushed the crowd. They brought some Iraqi teenagers into the compound and proceeded to beat them. The video also includes a voiceover, apparently by the cameraman, taunting the beaten teenagers.

The person recording could be heard saying:
:&quot;Oh, yes! Oh Yes! Now you gonna get it. You little kids. You little motherfucking bitch!, you little motherfucking bitch.&quot;

The event was broadcast in mainstream media, leading the British government and military to condemn it. The incident raised particular concerns for British soldiers, who had previously enjoyed a more favorable position than American soldiers in the region. Following the incident, there were media reports expressing concerns about the safety of soldiers in the country.

While the tape received some criticism from Iraq, it was relatively muted, and media outlets found individuals willing to speak out. The Royal Military Police conducted an investigation, but the prosecuting authorities determined that there was insufficient evidence to justify court-martial proceedings.

===May 2004===
In May 2004, a British soldier identified as M004 mistreated captured, unarmed prisoners of war during a &quot;tactical questioning&quot; at Camp Abu Naji.

&quot;See: Mukaradeeb wedding party massacre&quot;

On May 19, 2004, the village of Mukaradeeb was attacked by American helicopters, resulting in the deaths of 42 men, women, and children. The casualties included 11 women and 14 children, as confirmed by Hamdi Noor al-Alusi, the manager of the nearest hospital. Western journalists also viewed the bodies of the children before they were buried.

===November 2005===
&quot;See: Haditha killings&quot;

On November 19, 24 Iraqis were killed, at least 15 of whom, and allegedly all, were non-combatant civilians. All are believed to have been killed by a group of U.S. Marines. The ongoing investigation into the incident claimed to have found evidence that &quot;supports accusations that U.S. Marines deliberately shot civilians, including unarmed women and children,&quot; according to an anonymous Pentagon official.

===March 2006===
&quot;See: Mahmudiyah killings&quot;

On March 12, an Iraqi girl was raped and murdered along with her family in the Mahmudiyah killings. The incident led to the prosecution of the offenders and sparked a number of reprisal attacks against U.S. troops by insurgent forces.

&quot;See: Ishaqi incident&quot;

On March 15, 11 Iraqi civilians were allegedly bound and executed by U.S. troops in what is known as the &quot;Ishaqi incident.&quot; A U.S. investigation concluded that military personnel had acted appropriately and followed the proper rules of engagement, responding to hostile fire and gradually escalating force until the threat was eliminated. The Iraqi government rejected the American conclusions. In September 2011, the Iraqi government reopened their investigation after WikiLeaks published a leaked diplomatic cable highlighting concerns raised by U.N. inspector Philip Alston, the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary, or Arbitrary Executions.

===April 2006===
&quot;See: Hamdania incident&quot;

On April 26, U.S. Marines shot and killed an unarmed Iraqi man. An investigation by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service led to charges of murder, kidnapping, and conspiracy related to the cover-up of the incident. The defendants include seven Marines and a Navy Corpsman. As of February 2007, five of the defendants had pleaded guilty to lesser charges of kidnapping and conspiracy and agreed to testify against the remaining defendants, who face murder charges. Additional Marines from the same battalion faced lesser charges of assault related to the use of physical force during interrogations of suspected insurgents.

===May 2006===

On May 9, U.S. troops from the 101st Airborne Division executed three male Iraqi detainees at the Muthana Chemical Complex. An investigation and lengthy court proceedings followed. Spc. William Hunsaker and Pfc. Corey Clagett both pleaded guilty to murder and were each sentenced to 18 years for premeditated murder. Spc. Juston Graber pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for shooting one of the wounded detainees and was sentenced to nine months. A fourth soldier, Staff Sgt. Ray Girouard of Sweetwater, Tennessee, was convicted of obstruction of justice, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and violation of a general order.

==Human rights in northern Iraq==

In Iraqi Kurdistan, according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the &quot;prime responsibility for human rights abuses lies with the two parties holding the reins of power in Iraqi Kurdistan — the KDP and PUK,&quot; due to their political and military dominance. Amnesty reported that Francis Yusuf Shabo, an Assyrian Christian politician responsible for addressing complaints by Assyrian Christians about disputed villages, was shot dead on May 31, 1993, in Duhok, and no one had been brought to justice. Similarly, Lazar Mikho Hanna (known as Abu Nasir), another Assyrian Christian politician, was shot dead on June 14, 1993, in Duhok.

Amnesty criticized the impunity granted to Kurdish political parties&#x27; armed and special forces, noting that assailants were not held accountable. The report highlighted the &quot;active undermining of the judiciary and the lack of respect for its independence by the political parties.&quot; It also documented incidents where Kurdish forces &quot;arrested people arbitrarily,&quot; tortured detainees, killed civilians, and failed to bring perpetrators to justice.

The UNHCR reported incidents of violence against political opponents and minorities in areas under Kurdish control. Minority leaders have alleged that Kurdish political parties and forces have subjected them to violence, forced assimilation, discrimination, political marginalization, and arbitrary arrests and detention. The UNHCR noted that Kurdish parties and forces have been &quot;considered responsible for arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detention, and torture of political opponents and members of ethnic/religious minorities.&quot;

The report also highlighted complaints from Christians about Kurdish attempts to assimilate them, as well as allegations of &quot;the use of force, discrimination, and electoral fraud by Kurdish parties and militias.&quot; One notable incident occurred in October 2006, when KRG forces reportedly raided the building of a Christian media organization and detained its staff.

The UNHCR reported claims from Christian parties alleging &quot;harassment and forced assimilation by Kurdish militias in Kirkuk and surrounding areas, with the aim of incorporating these areas into the Region of Kurdistan.&quot; Christians have accused Kurdish parties and their military forces of engaging in &quot;acts of violence and discrimination, arbitrary arrests and detention on sectarian grounds, political marginalization (including through electoral manipulations), monopolization of government offices, and altering demographics to incorporate Kirkuk and other mixed areas into the Region of Kurdistan.&quot;

The Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) described this strategy as a form of &quot;soft ethnic cleansing.&quot; According to the UNHCR, Christians have repeatedly complained about ongoing Kurdification efforts. The U.S. State Department also reported that &quot;Kurdish authorities abused and discriminated against minorities in the North, including Turkmen, Arabs, Christians, and Shabak.&quot;

The UNHCR further noted that Kurdish parties &quot;denied services to certain villages, arrested minorities without due process, detained them in undisclosed locations, and pressured minority schools to teach in the Kurdish language.&quot; Additionally, Christians and Shabak people alleged that in the 2005 elections, &quot;non-resident Kurds entered polling centers, and over 200 votes were cast illegally before the Multi-National Force intervened to stop the voting irregularities.&quot;

In 2005, a peaceful demonstration by Shabak people &quot;turned violent after KDP gunmen shot at the crowd.&quot; The UNHCR reported that Christians were at &quot;risk of arbitrary arrest and incommunicado detention&quot; by Kurdish forces. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; highlighted extrajudicial detentions as early as 2005, describing a &quot;concerted and widespread initiative&quot; by Kurdish parties to assert authority in Kirkuk in an increasingly provocative manner. The report noted that arbitrary arrests and abductions by Kurdish militias had &quot;greatly exacerbated tensions along purely ethnic lines.&quot;

The UN Assistance Mission for Iraq&#x27;s Human Rights Office (UNAMI HRO) stated in 2007 that religious minorities &quot;face increasing threats, intimidation, and detentions, often in KRG facilities run by Kurdish intelligence and security forces.&quot; The &quot;Washington Post&quot; estimated that there were 600 or more extrajudicial transfers, with detainees reporting &quot;arbitrary arrests, incommunicado detentions, the use of torture, and unlawful confiscation of property.&quot; 

Abuses by Kurdish forces ranged from &quot;threats and intimidation to detention in undisclosed locations without due process.&quot; The Kurdish parties’ plans to incorporate &quot;disputed areas&quot; like Kirkuk into Kurdistan were met with resistance from Christian, Arab, and Turkmen groups.

The UNHCR noted that Christians and Arabs in Mosul, Kirkuk, and surrounding areas, which are &quot;under de facto control of the KRG,&quot; have become victims of threats, harassment, and arbitrary detention. The UNHCR also reported that Christian and Arab internally displaced people (IDPs) face discrimination and that those expressing opposition to the Kurdish parties, such as by participating in demonstrations, risk &quot;arbitrary arrest and detention.&quot;

The KDP and PUK have been &quot;repeatedly accused of nepotism, corruption, and lack of internal democracy,&quot; according to the UNHCR. Journalists have claimed that press freedom is restricted and that criticism of the ruling parties can result in physical harassment, the seizure of cameras and notebooks, and arrest. For example, Kamal Sayid Qadir was sentenced to 30 years in prison after writing critically about Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani. The sentence was later reduced due to international pressure. 

The UNHCR also reported arbitrary detentions of suspected political opponents by Kurdish authorities. Minorities have complained about &quot;forcible assimilation into Kurdish society,&quot; increased discrimination against the non-Kurdish population, and efforts to dominate and &quot;kurdify&quot; traditionally mixed areas like Kirkuk. A 2006 poll conducted in Erbil, Sulaymaniyah, and Dahuk revealed that 79% of Kurds opposed allowing Arabs to enter Iraqi Kurdistan, and 63% opposed their settlement in the region.

Assyrian groups have stated that Kurdish authorities alter historical and geographical facts in school textbooks. For example, Assyrian Christian places are reportedly given new Kurdish names, and historical or Biblical figures are claimed to be Kurdish. 

The American Mesopotamian Organization (AMO) demanded an official apology from Kurdistan President Massoud Barzani for the murder of Assyrians by Kurds in the past, alleging that thousands of Assyrian Christians were killed in the region over the last century. The AMO also criticized a message from Barzani on the occasion of Assyrian Martyrs Remembrance Day, which coincided with the 80th anniversary of the Semile massacre. The massacre, conducted by Kurdish general Bakr Sidqi, was referenced in Barzani&#x27;s message, which controversially portrayed the Assyrians killed in the Simmele massacre as martyrs in the &quot;Kurdistan liberation movement.&quot;

Assyrians in the Iraqi Kurdistan region face significant discrimination in various fields of work. Christian Assyrians are often limited to jobs as salespeople in liquor shops or as beauticians in salons, making them targets for Muslim extremists. In 2011, many Assyrian shops were burned. Additionally, Assyrians are reportedly excluded from professions such as police officers, soldiers, journalists for major media outlets, judges, and senior positions within educational institutions.

Local Assyrian history in the KRG-controlled area is often rebranded as Kurdish history. City names have been changed to Kurdish, and Assyrian heritage sites are reportedly neglected or destroyed. Furthermore, Assyrian history is not acknowledged in school textbooks, museums, or during memorial days. 

There are also claims that Kurdish criminal organizations force Assyrian girls, particularly vulnerable refugees from southern Iraq, into prostitution. Those who refuse reportedly face death threats. These organizations are said to have ties to political leaders, enabling them to quickly issue passports and send these girls to European Union countries to work in the sex trade. 

Assyrians allege that Kurds are actively working to &quot;Kurdify&quot; the local Christian population in northern Iraq. Reports indicate that Christians are sometimes forced to identify as Kurds to access essential services like education or healthcare. Similarly, Yazidis and Shabaks are not recognized as distinct ethnicities, and Assyrians from northern Iraq are increasingly pressured to identify as &quot;Kurdistani&quot; or &quot;Kurdish Christians.&quot;

The KRG has also been accused of discriminatory practices against non-Kurdish minorities. Many Assyrians and Yazidis in the Nineveh Plains claim that the KRG has confiscated their property without compensation and has begun constructing settlements on their land. There have also been allegations of killings of Assyrians by agents of Kurdish political parties.

Reports suggest that the KRG uses tactics such as intimidation, threats, restricted access to services, arbitrary arrests, and extrajudicial detentions to pressure political opponents and ordinary members of minority communities into supporting the KRG’s efforts to expand into disputed territories.

In 2014, Assyrians accused the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of systematically disarming and abandoning Assyrian and other minority communities in anticipation of an ISIS assault. The KRG reportedly distributed notices to Assyrians in northern Iraq, demanding their complete disarmament and assuring them that the Kurdish Peshmerga would protect them against ISIS. However, when ISIS launched its attacks, the Peshmerga abruptly retreated.

A similar situation occurred in the Sinjar region and Shingal, where Kurdish Peshmerga forces retreated as ISIS advanced in 2014. Peshmerga General Holgard Hekmat, a spokesman for the Peshmerga Ministry, admitted in an interview with &quot;SpiegelOnline&quot;: “Our soldiers just ran away. It’s a shame and apparently a reason why they invent such allegations.” 

As a result of these events, approximately 150,000 Assyrian Christians were violently displaced from their ancestral homes in the Nineveh Plains. A KRG official was quoted in a &quot;Reuters&quot; article in 2014, stating, “ISIL gave us in two weeks what Maliki couldn’t give us in eight years.”

Some Assyrians activists claim they have suffered not only from Arabization but also from Kurdification in Iraqi Kurdistan. These activists allege that the number of Christians living in the region has declined due to the destruction of villages and the implementation of Kurdification policies. 

Historically, Christians, including Assyrian Christians, made up a much larger proportion of the population in northern Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan than they do today. Their numbers have significantly decreased due to massacres, displacement, and other factors.

Additionally, the region is home to crypto-Christians—individuals who outwardly identify as Kurdish Muslims but retain memories of their Armenian or Nestorian Christian heritage. Relations between the remaining Christian population and the Kurds have often been strained.

According to Assyrian expert Michael Youash, some Christians became refugees because Kurds seized their land, and the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) failed to assist them in reclaiming it. In 2007, Youash also reported &quot;numerous instances of Kurdish authorities discriminating against minorities in the North,&quot; noting that authorities denied services to certain villages, arrested minorities without due process, and pressured minority schools to teach in Kurdish. 

Additionally, reports indicate that Christians who lack political representation struggle to expand their schools and often face exclusion from anything beyond basic funding. Assyrian groups criticized the Kurdish authorities&#x27; investigations into a series of bombings targeting Christians in 1998 and 1999. 

Assyrians have also been victims of attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and have often been caught in intra-Kurdish conflicts. For instance, in 1997, six Assyrians were killed during a PKK attack in Dohuk. A 1999 U.S. government country report cited allegations by the Assyrian International News Agency about the murder and rape of Helena Aloun Sawa, an Assyrian housekeeper for a KDP politician. Assyrians alleged that this case fit a &quot;well-established pattern&quot; of Kurdish authorities&#x27; complicity in attacks against Assyrian Christians in northern Iraq.

In more recent times, some scholars have noted that in northern Iraq, particularly in the area of &quot;ancient Assyria,&quot; Kurdish expansion has come at the expense of the Assyrian population. Due to both Arab and Kurdish intimidation policies, particularly by the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP), the Aramaic-speaking Christian population has been significantly reduced. It has been claimed that Kurds have &quot;raised impediments to the acquisition of international aid for development, attempted to prevent the establishment of Aramaic language schools, and blocked the creation of Christian Assyrian schools.&quot; These issues have also been criticized by the U.S. State Department.

Additionally, attacks on Christians have been perpetrated by both Arab and Kurdish Islamist groups, such as ISIS and the Kurdish Ansar ul-Islam. Kurdish forces have also been accused of harassing Arab residents. 

Assyrian Christian refugees have been blocked from returning to their villages across the Nineveh Plain by the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG), according to a report from The Investigative Project on Terrorism. Jeff Gardiner, director of Restore Nineveh Now, stated, &quot;The Kurdish authorities did not protect the people of the Nineveh Plain. In a way, this was enabled by the Kurdish government. They really set them [Assyrians] up for this catastrophic outcome.&quot; Gardiner dismissed claims of a security risk, calling the KRG&#x27;s actions a &quot;land grab.&quot;

Robert Nicholson of The Philos Project remarked, &quot;For months we&#x27;ve been receiving numerous reports from Assyrian Christians and Yazidis that Kurdish forces are using the fog of war to seize land that rightfully belongs to victims of genocide. Each week those reports are increasing. The Nineveh Plain has never been a Kurdish territory. It belongs to the Christians (Assyrians) and Yazidis who have been living there for thousands of years.&quot; Members of the Nineveh Protection Units, an Assyrian militia, have faced obstruction by the KRG, with their movements impeded by Kurdish forces.

In a letter to Kurdistani President Masoud Barzani, John McCain expressed concern about &quot;reports of land confiscation and statements you have made regarding Kurdish territorial claims to the Nineveh Plains region.&quot; According to Gardner, &quot;This is nothing new. Assyrian Christians complained about the illegal settlement of Kurdistani families on Assyrian land in the early 1990s. The ultimate strategy aims to unify Iraq&#x27;s Kurds with those in Syria and Turkey in a broader Kurdish state.&quot;

In December 2011, hundreds of Kurds in Zakho burned and destroyed Christian Assyrian businesses and hotels after Friday prayers. Human rights groups suggested that the riots were planned by Kurdish authorities, noting that security representatives had made inquiries about liquor stores three days before the riots and that security forces did not intervene to stop the violence. Assyrians also face discrimination in the labor market and are burdened with administrative tasks, such as the annual requirement for Internally Displaced Persons to obtain a residence permit. Assyrian students are treated and graded differently from Kurdish students. Additionally, Assyrians &quot;suffer abuses and discrimination as a result of the KRG&#x27;s aspirations to extend its control and its plans to reshape the demographics of Mosul and the Nineveh Plains.&quot; An official police force composed of Assyrians &quot;has not been established due to massive resistance from Kurdish groups.&quot;

Government complicity in &quot;religiously motivated discrimination has been reported in the Kurdish Regional Government (KRG).&quot; According to the State Department, Christians &quot;living in areas north of Mosul asserted that the KRG confiscated their property without compensation,&quot; and Assyrian Christians also alleged that the Kurdish Democratic Party-dominated judiciary routinely discriminates against non-Muslims. Chaldo-Assyrian Christians have stated that KRG officials &quot;deny Christians key social benefits, including employment and housing,&quot; and that &quot;foreign reconstruction assistance for Assyrian communities is being controlled by the KRG.&quot; KRG officials have used &quot;public works projects to divert water and other vital resources from Assyrian to Kurdish communities.&quot; These deprivations led to a mass exodus, followed by &quot;the seizure and conversion of abandoned Assyrian property by the local Kurdish population.&quot; Turkmen groups report &quot;similar abuses by Kurdish officials, suggesting a pattern of pervasive discrimination, harassment, and marginalization.&quot;

Violence against Iraq&#x27;s Christian community &quot;remains a significant concern, particularly in Baghdad and the northern Kurdish regions,&quot; with a pattern of &quot;official discrimination, harassment, and marginalization by KRG officials exacerbating these conditions.&quot; Kurdish groups have been accused of attempting to annex territories belonging to Assyrians, &quot;claiming that these areas are historically Kurdish.&quot; Since 2003, &quot;Kurdish peshmerga, security forces, and political parties have moved into these territories, establishing de facto control over many of the disputed areas.&quot; Assyrians, Shabak, and Turkomen groups have accused Kurdish forces &quot;of engaging in systematic abuses and discrimination against them to further Kurdish territorial claims.&quot; These accusations include &quot;reports of Kurdish officials interfering with minorities&#x27; voting rights, encroaching on, seizing, and refusing to return minority land, conditioning the provision of services and assistance to minority communities on support for Kurdish expansion, forcing minorities to identify themselves as either Arabs or Kurds, and impeding the formation of local minority police forces.&quot;

===Freedom of speech and political freedom===

Kurdish officials in Iraq have accused the ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), led by Masoud Barzani, of &quot;all kinds of intimidation,&quot; corruption, and ballot stuffing. During the 2005 elections, &quot;Kurdish authorities, tasked with delivering ballot boxes to Assyrian districts in Iraqi Kurdistan, failed to do so, while Assyrian election workers were fired upon and killed.&quot; As a consequence, the Assyrian Democratic Movement was marginalized.

==The current state of human rights==
Numerous human rights organizations and Shiite officials have raised significant criticisms, alleging that Sunni groups have systematically kidnapped, tortured, and killed Shiites or those they consider enemies. Amnesty International has also extensively criticized the Iraqi government for its handling of the Walid Yunis Ahmad case, in which an ethnically Turkmen journalist from Iraqi Kurdistan was held for ten years without charge or trial.

According to the Human Rights Watch annual report, the human rights situation in Iraq remains deplorable. Since 2015, the country has been embroiled in a bloody armed conflict involving ISIS and a coalition of Kurdish forces, central Iraqi government forces, pro-government militias, and a United States-led international air campaign. The United Nations reported that 3.2 million Iraqis were displaced due to the conflict. Furthermore, the international organization stated that the warring parties employed various methods, including extrajudicial executions, suicide attacks, and airstrikes, which resulted in the deaths and injuries of over 20,000 civilians.

An Amnesty International report concluded that the Peshmerga forces of the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) were preventing residents of Arab villages and Arab residents of mixed Arab-Kurdish towns from returning to their homes. In some cases, the Peshmerga forces had destroyed or allowed the destruction of homes and property, seemingly to prevent residents from returning in the future. Amnesty reported that Arab houses were often looted, intentionally burned, bulldozed, or blown up after fighting had ended, and the Peshmerga had taken control of these areas. These actions were not isolated incidents but part of a broader pattern.

The report emphasized that the forced displacement of Arab residents and the extensive, unlawful destruction of civilian homes and property violated international humanitarian law and should be investigated as war crimes. For example, the village of Tabaj Hamid was completely razed, and in Jumeili, 95% of all walls and structures were destroyed. Amnesty International researchers reported being apprehended by Peshmerga forces, who escorted them out of the area and prevented them from taking photographs. 

Amnesty stated that the deliberate demolition of civilian homes is unlawful under international humanitarian law and considered these acts of forced displacement to constitute war crimes. The organization also urged KRG authorities to conduct prompt and independent investigations into all deaths that occurred during protests against the KDP, such as those in October 2015, and to disclose the findings.

Amnesty International criticized the Peshmerga forces of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) and Kurdish militias in northern Iraq for bulldozing, blowing up, and burning thousands of homes in what appears to be an effort to uproot Arab communities. The report, &quot;Banished and Dispossessed: Forced Displacement and Deliberate Destruction in Northern Iraq&quot;, is based on field investigations in Iraq. It stated, “Tens of thousands of Arab civilians who were forced to flee their homes because of fighting are now struggling to survive in makeshift camps in desperate conditions. Many have lost their livelihoods and all their possessions, and with their homes destroyed, they have nothing to return to. By barring the displaced from returning to their villages and destroying their homes, KRG forces are further exacerbating their suffering.” The report provided evidence of forced displacement and large-scale destruction of homes in villages and towns by Peshmerga forces. 

Human Rights Watch also reported that Kurds denied Arabs the right to return to their homes while allowing Kurds free movement, even permitting Kurds to move into homes that belonged to Arabs. In a 2016 report titled &quot;‘Where Are We Supposed to Go?’: Destruction and Forced Displacement in Kirkuk&quot;, Amnesty International documented cases of Kurdish authorities demolishing and bulldozing homes and forcibly displacing hundreds of Arab residents. 

In 2005, during a demonstration by the Democratic Shabak Coalition, the KDP opened fire on protestors, killing two Assyrians and wounding several Assyrians and Shabak participants. Additionally, Assyrian groups have accused Kurdish authorities of election rigging in northern Iraq and of preventing Assyrian representation in politics.

The Shabak people have also suffered from discrimination. Hunain al-Qaddo, a Shabak politician, told Human Rights Watch that &quot;the Peshmerga have no genuine interest in protecting his community and that Kurdish security forces are more interested in controlling Shabaks and their leaders than protecting them.&quot; He further stated that Shabaks are &quot;suffering at the hands of the Peshmerga and that the Kurdish government refuses to let the Iraqi armed forces protect them or allow them to establish their own Shabak police force to safeguard their community.&quot;

Kurdish forces have been implicated in some attacks against Shabaks. In 2008, Mullah Khadim Abbas, the leader of the Shabak Democratic Gathering—a group opposing the incorporation of Shabak villages into the KRG—was killed only 150 meters from a Peshmerga outpost. Before his assassination, Abbas had angered Kurdish authorities by criticizing Shabaks who supported Kurdish agendas and denouncing Kurdish policies that, in his view, undermined the identity of the Shabak community.

In 2009, Shabak lawmaker al-Qaddo survived an assassination attempt in the Nineveh Plains. He told Human Rights Watch that the attackers wore Kurdish security uniforms. Al-Qaddo alleged that the Kurdish government aimed to impose its will on the Shabak and acquire their lands by silencing him.

Shabak leaders have frequently complained about the lack of accountability for killings. In some incidents, the KDP was accused of failing to investigate the deaths of non-Kurdish civilians at the hands of the Peshmerga. Human Rights Watch noted that &quot;the root of the problem is the near-universal perception among Kurdish leaders that minority groups are, in fact, Kurds.&quot; The report further stated that Kurdish authorities have sometimes dealt harshly with Yazidi and Shabak individuals who resisted attempts to impose a Kurdish identity on them.

==Sectarian warfare in Iraq==
Iraq experienced a state of sectarian civil war from 2006 to 2008. During this period, small groups and militias carried out bombings in civilian areas and assassinations targeting officials at various levels, as well as Shiites and smaller religious minorities. Secular-oriented individuals, officials of the new government, aides to the United States (such as translators), and individuals and families from the country&#x27;s various religious groups faced violence and death threats.

===Refugee response to threats to life===
&quot; See also Refugees of Iraq. &quot;

As a result of attempted murders and death threats, approximately 2 million Iraqis fled the country, primarily seeking refuge in Syria, Jordan, and Egypt.

==Propaganda==
On February 17, 2006, then U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld discussed the emergence of new realities in the media age:

:&quot;In Iraq, for example, the U.S. military command, working closely with the Iraqi government and the U.S. embassy, has sought nontraditional means to provide accurate information to the Iraqi people in the face of aggressive campaign of disinformation. Yet this has been portrayed as inappropriate; for example, the allegations of someone in the military hiring a contractor, and the contractor allegedly paying someone to print a story—a true story—but paying to print a story.&quot;

On March 3, 2006, Army General George Casey stated, &quot;The U.S. military plans to continue paying Iraqi newspapers to publish articles favorable to the United States after an inquiry found no fault with the controversial practice.&quot; Casey explained that an internal review had concluded the U.S. military was not violating U.S. law or Pentagon guidelines with its information operations campaign. As part of this campaign, U.S. troops and a private contractor wrote pro-American articles and paid to have them published in Iraqi media without attribution.

The legal status of freedom of speech and the press in Iraq remains unclear. While both freedoms are guaranteed in the Iraqi Constitution, they include exemptions for Islamic morality and national security. Additionally, the 1969 Iraqi Criminal Code contains vague prohibitions against using the press or any electronic means of communication for &quot;indecent&quot; purposes.

==Women&#x27;s rights==


Women in Iraq at the beginning of the 21st century face a status that is influenced by many factors, including wars (most recently the Iraq War), sectarian religious conflict, debates concerning Islamic law and Iraq&#x27;s Constitution, cultural traditions, and modern secularism. Hundreds of thousands of Iraqi women have been widowed as a result of a series of wars and internal conflicts. Women&#x27;s rights organizations continue to struggle against harassment and intimidation as they work to promote improvements to women&#x27;s status in law, education, the workplace, and many other spheres of Iraqi life. According to a 2008 report in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, the Kurdistan region of Iraq is one of the few places in the world where female genital mutilation has been rampant. In 2008, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) stated that honor killings are a serious concern in Iraq, particularly in Iraqi Kurdistan. Honor killings are common in the region, and women also face forced and underage marriage, domestic violence, and polygamy issues. Since the early 1990s, several thousand Iraqi Kurdish women have died from self-immolation.

==Other human rights==

The United States, through the CPA, abolished the death penalty (which has since been reinstated) and ordered that the Criminal Code of 1969 (as amended in 1985) and the Civil Code of 1974 would be the operating legal system in Iraq. However, there has been some debate regarding the extent to which the CPA rules have been applied.

For example, the Iraqi Criminal Code of 1969 (as amended in 1985) does not prohibit the formation of trade unions, and the Iraqi Constitution promises that such organizations will be recognized (a right under Article 23 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights). However, for some reason, the Iraqi courts and special tribunals seem to be operating under a slightly revised version of the 1988 legal code, which means that the 1987 ban on unions might still be in place.

Likewise, while the Iraqi Criminal Code of 1969 or the apparent 1988 edition does not expressly prohibit homosexual relations between consenting adults in private (a right under a United Nations Human Rights Commission ruling in 1994), scattered reports suggest that homosexuality is still being treated as a crime, possibly a capital crime under a 2001 amendment that technically should not exist. For more information on this topic, see Gay rights in Iraq.

== Post COVID-19 rights ==
During COVID-19, the Iraqi government implemented stricter curfews and limited shopping hours instead of full lockdowns, aiming to keep the economy afloat. However, human welfare significantly worsened due to droughts in the area. The modern government did not provide adequate assistance to the majority of the population during the crisis. All but two refugee camps were closed, and internally displaced people were targeted by armed forces. Many of these displaced families had been fleeing the Syrian civil war. In December and November 2021, heavy rainfall caused flash floods, leading to many families becoming homeless or displaced, both internally and externally.
