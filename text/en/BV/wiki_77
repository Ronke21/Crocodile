<text>Hervé Auguste Étienne Albans Faye ( – ) was a French astronomer, born at Saint-Benoît-du-Sault (Indre) and educated at the École Polytechnique, which he left in 1834, before completing his course, to accept a position in the Paris Observatory to which he had been appointed on the recommendation of M. Arago. It was during his time at the École Polytechnique that he developed his interest in astronomy. 

He studied comets, and discovered the periodic comet 4P/Faye on 22 November 1843. His discovery of &quot;Faye&#x27;s Comet&quot; attracted worldwide attention, and won him the 1844 Lalande Prize and a membership in the French Academy of Sciences. In 1848 he became an instructor in geodesy at the Polytechnique, and in 1854 rector of the academy at Nancy and professor of astronomy in the faculty of science there. Other promotions followed in succeeding decades. He became Minister of Public Instruction in the Rochebouet cabinet in 1877, a position which he held only briefly.

Faye served as the President of the Société Astronomique de France (SAF), the French astronomical society, from 1889 to 1891. He also served as president of the International Geodetic Association from 1892 to 1902.

His work covered the entire field of astronomical investigation. It comprised the determination of comet periods, the measurement of parallaxes, and the study of stellar and planetary movements. He also studied the physics of the sun. He advanced several original theories on the nature and form of comets, meteors, the aurora borealis, and the sun.

==Religious beliefs==
In his work &quot;Sur l&#x27;origine du Monde&quot;, Faye quoted the beginning of Psalm 19, &quot;Caeli enarrant gloriam Dei&quot; (&quot;The heavens declare the glory of God&quot;) and stated,

We run no risk of deceiving ourselves in considering it [Superior Intelligence] the author of all things, in referring to it those splendours of the heavens which aroused our thoughts: and finally we are ready to understand and accept the traditional formula: God, Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth.
==Publications==
In collaboration with Charles Galusky he translated Humboldt&#x27;s &quot;Cosmos&quot; (four volumes, 1846–59), and, in addition to numerous contributions to scientific periodicals, published the following important works: 
* &quot;Sur les déclinaisons absolues&quot; (1850)
* &quot;Leçons de cosmographie&quot; (1852; second edition, 1854)
* &quot;Sur les cyclones solaires&quot; (1873)
* &quot;Cours d&#x27;astronomie de l&#x27;Ecole Polytechnique&quot; (two volumes, 1881–83)
* &quot;Sur l&#x27;origine du monde&quot; (1884; third edition, enlarged 1895)
* &quot;Nouvelle étude sur les tempêtes, cyclones, trombes, ou tornadoes&quot; (1897)

<text>Utah is a state located in the Western United States. , there are 253 municipalities in the U.S. state of Utah. A municipality is called a town if the population is under 1,000 people, and a city if the population is over 1,000 people. Incorporation means that a municipal charter has been adopted by the affected population following a referendum. In the Constitution of Utah, cities and towns are granted &quot;the authority to exercise all powers relating to municipal affairs, and to adopt and enforce within its limits, local police, sanitary and similar regulations not in conflict with the general law&quot; They also have the power to raise and collect taxes, to provide and maintain local public services, acquire by eminent domain any property needed to make local improvements, and to raise money by bonds.

The area had been occupied by different Native American groups dating to about 10,000 years before present. Europeans entered the region the 1500s with the expedition of Garci-Lopez de Cardenas, as recorded by Francisco de Coronado, and in subsequent decades other Europeans had a scattered presence as mountain men or explorers but there were no large or permanent settlements. Utah was colonized by the Spanish Empire as part of the Province of Las Californias, and later Alta California. After Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821, Utah was under Mexican control until the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848 ceded the territory to the United States of America. The Spanish and Mexican legacy of the state is present in many place names, particularly in the southern portion of Utah. On July 22, 1847, the first party of Latter-day Saint pioneers arrived in the Salt Lake Valley, where they founded Salt Lake City. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 Mormon pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah. Initial colonization along the Wasatch Front was mostly made by members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), with little direct involvement from LDS leadership. Outside the Wasatch Front, many settlements were directed, planned, organized, and dispatched by leaders of the Church. Settlements were also founded by the railroads, mining companies and non-LDS settlers. Many settlements were named after leaders, history or from scriptures of the LDS Church. Natural features of the region, including rivers, mountains, lakes and flora, are also commonly used for names.

The 2017 American Community Survey estimate puts 2,792,531 of the state&#x27;s 3,101,883 residents within these cities and towns, accounting for 90% of the population. Just over 75% of Utah&#x27;s population is concentrated in the four Wasatch Front counties of Salt Lake, Utah, Davis, and Weber. The largest city is the state&#x27;s capital of Salt Lake City with a population of 194,188, and the former coal mining town of Scofield is the smallest town with 15 people.

In 2015, a new form of local government, the metro township, was created. Five unincorporated townships in Salt Lake County voted to incorporate as metro townships, allowing them to elect councils and manage a budget, but they must contract with other cities for municipal services and have limited taxation powers. The five metro townships are Kearns, Magna, Copperton, Emigration Canyon and White City.

<doc id="627169" wikidata="Q2487253" url="?curid=627169" title="Tregaron">
<text>Tregaron ( &quot;town of St Caron&quot;) is an ancient market town in Ceredigion, Wales. It is sited astride the River Brenig, a tributary of the River Teifi, and is north-east of Lampeter. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the ward of Tregaron was 1,213 and 67% of the population could speak Welsh; Tregaron is a community covering ; two-thirds of the population were born in Wales.

==History==
Tregaron received its royal charter as a town in 1292. It owes its origin and growth to its central location in the upper Teifi Valley. It was the market town for the scattered agricultural communities in the broad, fertile countryside to the south and the rich landowners with extensive holdings in the uplands to the east, the home of many sheep and few people. To the north was Cors Caron which was a fertile land when drained, and to the west a hilly region with self-sufficient farmers on smallholdings of a few acres. These people all converged on Tregaron for the weekly market and the annual fair, , where the sale of poultry, pigs, cattle and horses took place. The charter for the yearly fair was granted by Edward I in the 13th century. Sheep fairs were held in May and June and two hiring fairs took place in November. A large number of taverns and inns in the town catered for the influx of country folk to these events.

In the middle of the 18th century, Matthew Evans kept an inn in the town. He had two sons and a daughter who were celebrated robbers and collectively known as (&#x27;Matthew&#x27;s children&#x27; in English). They lived for several years in a cave near Devils Bridge which still bears their name. They terrorized the district and would give to their friends a glove to act as a passport and identify them to their brethren. It was difficult to apprehend the trio because of the narrowness of the entrance to the cave which made it impossible to storm. After several years of success, they committed a murder and, eventually being taken, were sentenced to death and executed.

Tregaron was a main gathering place for the drovers who, before the advent of rail transport, herded large numbers of cattle, sheep and even geese hundreds of miles to the markets of southeast England. Many Tregaron men were drovers and accumulated considerable wealth in the process. They acted as news carriers and unofficial postmen and some were adept at avoiding tollgates.

The Tregaron area had a number of water-driven woollen mills and was a centre for the manufacture of hosiery. Woollen socks were knitted at home by men, women and children and sold at the market, often to dealers who resold them in the industrial valleys of South Wales.

==Culture and community==
The church is dedicated to St Caron. He was a man of lowly origins but &quot;his courage and generous deportment obtained him the sovereignty in Wales: he made war against the Romans, reigned seven years and was buried in Tregarron&quot;. He is almost certainly the same person as Carausius (Roman name) who took power in Britain in 286 and was assassinated in 293 by Allectus (also see Carausian Revolt). According to Geoffrey of Monmouth in the translation from Welsh &quot;there was a young man of the name of Caron, of a British family, but of low degree, who... went to Rome, and solicited the Senate to grant him permission and aid to protect the sea coasts of Britain... [He] proposed to the Britons that they should make him king... Allectus with three legions... overpowered him...&quot; An early Christian stone slab bearing the name Carausius and the Chi Rho symbol is preserved in Penmachno. The church has a tower and stands on a rocky eminence. It consists of a simple nave and chancel.

Other notable buildings in the town include the 13th-century Talbot Hotel, which supposedly has an elephant buried in its grounds. The remote chapel is close to Tregaron. In March, 1977, a cottage near Tregaron was one target of an Operation Julie police raid in which vast quantities of the drug LSD were seized.
Nearby (Tregaron Bog), is known for its adders, buzzards, red kites, and polecats. The River Brenig is noted for its brown trout and eels. The river has been the subject of dredging and flood-protection works to provide 1-in-100-year flood protection to the town and improve the environment for wildlife along a stretch of river.

===Music and the arts===
An annual is held in the town each September, drawing performers from all parts of Wales and beyond. have been conducted at Tregaron for a century or more. The Caron Male Voice Choir was formed in 1969 and has performed in Europe and America as well as the UK. The National Eisteddfod was held in Tregaron in 2022 after being postponed in 2020 and 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

===Sport===
The town holds an annual festival of harness racing in August, which attracts racegoers from across the UK; this was started in 1980 by the Tregaron Trotting Club. A race day is now held early in May each year.

The Tregaron Rugby Football Club plays in Division Two West C of the Welsh Rugby Union, having won promotion from Division 3 in 2015.

An association football team, Tregaron Turfs F.C., plays in the Central Wales Football League Southern Division.

==Transport==

The nearest National Rail station is Aberystwyth, which facilitates services to Shrewsbury and Birmingham on the Cambrian line.

Tregaron once had its own railway station. In 1860, government approval to subsidise the construction of a railway from Manchester to Milford Haven was granted. At the urging of local people, led by David Davies and supported by Joseph Jenkins, capital was subscribed for a station at Tregaron. The PencaderLampeter section was completed in January 1866. The grand opening of the entire line was held the following year at Aberystwyth on 12 August 1867, providing a boost to the economy of the town. In 1965, Tregaron&#x27;s train service was withdrawn and the station closed, after the line was badly damaged by flooding south of Aberystwyth.

The town is served by several bus routes, which connect to Aberystwyth, Carmarthen and Lampeter; there are more sporadic services to other neighbouring small towns and villages. There are no buses in the evenings or on Sundays and bank holidays. Services are operated by First Cymru, Mid Wales Travel and Evans Coaches.

<doc id="627175" wikidata="Q6144345" url="?curid=627175" title="Southern American English">
<text>Southern American English or Southern U.S. English is a regional dialect or collection of dialects of American English spoken throughout the Southern United States, primarily by White Southerners and increasingly concentrated in more rural areas. As of 2000s research, its most innovative accents include southern Appalachian and certain Texan accents. Such research has described Southern American English as the largest American regional accent group by number of speakers. More formal terms then developed to characterize this dialect within American linguistics include &quot;Southern White Vernacular English&quot; and &quot;Rural White Southern English&quot;. However, more commonly in the United States, the variety is known as the Southern accent or simply Southern.

==History==
A diversity of earlier Southern dialects once existed: a consequence of the mix of English speakers from the British Isles (including largely English and Scots-Irish immigrants) who migrated to the American South in the 17th and 18th centuries, with particular 19th-century elements also borrowed from the London upper class and enslaved African-Americans. By the 19th century, this included distinct dialects in eastern Virginia, the greater Lowcountry area surrounding Charleston, the Appalachian upcountry region, the Black Belt plantation region, and secluded Atlantic coastal and island communities.

Following the American Civil War, as the South&#x27;s economy and migration patterns fundamentally transformed, so did Southern dialect trends. Over the next few decades, Southerners moved increasingly to Appalachian mill towns, to Texan farms, or out of the South entirely. The main result, further intensified by later upheavals such as the Great Depression, the Dust Bowl and perhaps World War II, is that a newer and more unified form of Southern American English consolidated, beginning around the last quarter of the 19th century, radiating outward from Texas and Appalachia through all the traditional Southern States until around World War II. This newer Southern dialect largely superseded the older and more diverse local Southern dialects, though it became quickly stigmatized in American popular culture. As a result, since around the 1950s and 1960s, the notable features of this newer Southern accent have been in a gradual decline, particularly among younger and more urban Southerners, though less so among rural white Southerners.

==Geography==

Despite the slow decline of the modern Southern accent, it is still documented as widespread as of the 2006 &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot;. Specifically, the &quot;Atlas&quot; documents a Southern accent in urban areas of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Arkansas, Louisiana (alongside Cajun and New Orleans accents), and West Virginia; many areas of Texas; the Jacksonville area of northern Florida; the Springfield area of southern Missouri; and in some urban speakers in eastern Kansas, southern Ohio, and the Tulsa area of Oklahoma. Although the &quot;Atlas&quot; is a nationwide study that focuses on urban areas, the Southern accent has been increasingly becoming concentrated, for decades, in rural areas, which are often less well-studied. Other 21st-century scholarship further includes within this dialect region southern Maryland, eastern and southern Oklahoma, the rest of central and northern Florida and southern Missouri, and southeastern New Mexico. 

Furthermore, the &quot;Atlas&quot; documents (South) Midland accents of the U.S. as sharing key features with Southern accents, like fronting and resistance to the cot-caught merger, while lacking other defining features like the Southern Vowel Shift. Such shared features extend across all of Texas and Oklahoma, as well as eastern and central Kansas, southern Missouri, southern Indiana, southern Ohio, and southern Illinois.

Finally, African-American accents across the United States have many common points with Southern accents due to the strong historical ties of African Americans to the South.
===Exceptions===
The &quot;Atlas&quot; notably identifies several culturally Southern cities in particular as lacking a Southern accent, either having shifted away from it or having never had it to begin with, such as Norfolk and Richmond, Virginia; Raleigh and Greenville, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; Atlanta and possibly Savannah, Georgia; Abilene, El Paso, Austin, and possibly Corpus Christi, Texas; and Oklahoma City. Some cities are home to both the Southern accent and other more locally distinct accents—most clearly New Orleans, Louisiana.

==Modern phonology==
Most of the Southern United States underwent several major sound changes from the beginning to the middle of the 20th century, during which a more unified, region-wide sound system developed, markedly different from the sound systems of the 19th-century Southern dialects.

The South as a present-day dialect region generally includes all of the pronunciation features below, which are popularly recognized in the United States as making up a &quot;Southern accent&quot;. The following phonological phenomena focus on the developing sound system of the 20th-century Southern dialects of the United States that altogether largely (though certainly not entirely) superseded the older Southern regional patterns. However, there is still variation in Southern speech regarding potential differences based on factors like a speaker&#x27;s exact sub-region, age, ethnicity, etc. 
*Southern Vowel Shift (sometimes simply called the Southern Shift): A chain shift regarding vowels is fully completed, or occurring, in most Southern dialects, especially 20th-century ones, and at the most advanced stage in the &quot;Inland South&quot; (i.e. away from the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts) as well as much of central and northern Texas. This 3-stage chain movement of vowels is first triggered by Stage 1 which dominates the entire Southern region, followed by Stage 2 which covers almost all of that area, and Stage 3 which is concentrated only in speakers of the two aforementioned core sub-regions. Stage 1 (defined below) may have begun in a minority of Southern accents as early as the first half of the 19th century with a glide weakening of to or ; however, it was still largely incomplete or absent in the mid-19th century, before expanding rapidly from the last quarter of the 19th into the middle of the 20th century; today, this glide weakening or even total glide deletion is the pronunciation norm throughout all of the Southern States.
**Stage 1 ( → ): 
***The starting point, or first stage, of the Southern Shift, is the transition of the diphthong () toward a &quot;glideless&quot; long vowel (), so that, for example, the word &quot;ride&quot; commonly approaches a sound that most other American English speakers would hear as &quot;rod&quot; or &quot;rad&quot;. Stage 1 is now complete for a majority of Southern dialects. Southern speakers particularly exhibit the Stage 1 shift at the ends of words and before voiced consonants, but not as commonly before voiceless consonants, where the diphthong instead may retain its glide, so that &quot;ride&quot; is , but &quot;right&quot; is . Inland (i.e. non-coastal) Southern speakers, however, indeed delete the glide of in all contexts, as in the stereotyped pronunciation &quot;nahs whaht rahss&quot; for &quot;nice white rice&quot;; these most shift-advanced speakers are largely found today in an Appalachian area that comprises eastern Tennessee, western North Carolina, and northern Alabama, as well as in central Texas. Certain traditional East Coast Southern accents do not exhibit this Stage 1 glide deletion, particularly in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia (cities that are, at best, considered marginal to the modern Southern dialect region). 
***Somewhere in &quot;the early stages of the Southern Shift&quot;, (as in &quot;trap&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;) moves generally higher and fronter in the mouth (often also giving it a complex gliding quality, starting higher and then gliding lower); thus can range variously away from its original position, with variants such as , , , and possibly even for those born between the World Wars. An example is that, to other English speakers, the Southern pronunciation of &quot;yap&quot; sounds something like &quot;yeah-up&quot;. See &quot;Southern vowel breaking&quot; below for more information.
**Stage 2 ( → and → ): 
***By removing the existence of , Stage 1 leaves open a lower space for (as in &quot;name&quot; and &quot;day&quot;) to occupy, causing Stage 2: the dragging of the diphthong into a lower starting position, towards or to a sound even lower or more retracted, or both. 
***At the same time, the pushing of into the vicinity of (as in &quot;red&quot; or &quot;belt&quot;), forces itself into a higher and fronter position, occupying the area (previously the vicinity of ). also often acquires an in-glide: thus, . An example is that, to other English speakers, the Southern pronunciation of &quot;yep&quot; sounds something like &quot;yay-up&quot;. Stage 2 is most common in heavily stressed syllables. Southern accents originating from cities that formerly had the greatest influence and wealth in the South (Richmond, Virginia; Charleston, South Carolina; Atlanta, Macon, and Savannah, Georgia; and all of Florida) do not traditionally participate in Stage 2.
**Stage 3 ( → and → ): By the same pushing and pulling domino effects described above, (as in &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;lick&quot;) and (as in &quot;beam&quot; or &quot;meet&quot;) follow suit by both possibly becoming diphthongs whose nuclei switch positions. may be pushed into a diphthong with a raised beginning, , while may be pulled into a diphthong with a lowered beginning, . An example is that, to other English speakers, the Southern pronunciation of &quot;fin&quot; sounds something like &quot;fee-in&quot;, while &quot;meet&quot; sounds something like &quot;mih-eet&quot;. Like the other stages of the Southern shift, Stage 3 is most common in heavily stressed syllables and particularly among Inland Southern speakers.
**Southern vowel breaking (&quot;Southern drawl&quot;): All three stages of the Southern Shift appear related to the short front pure vowels being &quot;broken&quot; into gliding vowels, making one-syllable words like &quot;pet&quot; and &quot;pit&quot; sound as if they might have two syllables (as something like &quot;pay-it&quot; and &quot;pee-it&quot;). This short front vowel gliding phenomenon is popularly recognized as the &quot;Southern drawl&quot;. The &quot;short &quot;a&quot;&quot;, &quot;short &quot;e&quot;&quot;, and &quot;short &quot;i&quot;&quot; vowels are all affected, developing a glide up from their original starting position to , and then often back down to a schwa vowel: ; ; and , respectively. Appearing mostly after the mid-19th century, this phenomenon is on the decline, being most typical of Southern speakers born before 1960.
*Unstressed, word-final → : The phoneme in an unstressed syllable at the end of a word fronts to , so that &quot;singing&quot; is sometimes written phonetically as &quot;singin&quot; . This is common in vernacular English dialects around the world.
*Lacking or transitioning cot–caught merger: The historical distinction between the two vowels sounds and , in words like &quot;caught&quot; and &quot;cot&quot; or &quot;stalk&quot; and &quot;stock&quot; is mainly preserved, though the exact articulation is distinct from most other English dialects. In much of the South during the 20th century, there was a trend to lower the vowel found in words like &quot;stalk&quot; and &quot;caught&quot;, often with an upglide, so that the most common result is roughly the gliding vowel . However, the cot–caught merger is becoming increasingly common throughout the United States, affecting Southeastern and even some Southern dialects, towards a merged vowel . In the South, this merger, or a transition towards this merger, is especially documented in central, northern, and (particularly) western Texas.

*Pin-pen merger: the vowel phonemes and now merge before nasal consonants, so that &quot;pen&quot; and &quot;pin&quot;, for instance, or &quot;hem&quot; and &quot;him&quot;, are pronounced the same, as &quot;pin&quot; or &quot;him&quot;, respectively. The merger, which is roughly towards the sound , is still unreported among some vestigial varieties of the older South, and other geographically Southern U.S. varieties that have eluded the Southern Vowel Shift, such as the Yat dialect of New Orleans or the anomalous dialect of Savannah, Georgia. 
*Rhoticity: The &quot;dropping&quot; of the &quot;r&quot; sound after vowels was historically widespread in the South, particularly in former plantation areas. This phenomenon, non-rhoticity, was considered prestigious before World War II, after which the social perception in the South reversed. Now, full rhoticity (sometimes called &quot;r&quot;-fulness), in which most or all &quot;r&quot; sounds are pronounced, is dominant throughout most of the South, and even &quot;hyper-rhoticity&quot; (articulation of a very distinctive sound), particularly among younger and female white Southerners. The sound quality of the Southern &quot;r&quot; is the &quot;bunch-tongued &quot;r&quot;&quot;, produced by strongly constricting the root or the midsection of the tongue, or both. The only major exceptions are among African-American Southern English speakers and among some south Louisiana and Cajun speakers, who are variably non-rhotic.
* Pronunciation of ⟨wh⟩: Most of the U.S. has completed the wine–whine merger, but, in many Southern accents, particularly inland Southern accents, the phonemes and remain distinct, so that pairs of words like &quot;wail&quot; and &quot;whale&quot; or &quot;wield&quot; and &quot;wheeled&quot; are not homophones.
* Lax and tense vowels often neutralize before, making pairs like &quot;feel&quot;/&quot;fill&quot; and &quot;fail&quot;/&quot;fell&quot; homophones for speakers in some areas of the South. Some speakers may distinguish between the two sets of words by reversing the normal vowel sound, e.g., &quot;feel&quot; in Southern may sound like &quot;fill&quot;, and vice versa.
* The back vowel (in &quot;goose&quot; or &quot;true&quot;) is fronted in the mouth to the vicinity of or even farther forward, which is then followed by a slight gliding quality; different gliding qualities have been reported, including both backward and (especially in the eastern half of the South) forward glides.
*The back vowel (in &quot;goat&quot; or &quot;toe&quot;) is fronted to the vicinity of , and perhaps even as far forward as .
** Certain words ending in unstressed (especially with the spelling ) may be pronounced as or , making &quot;yellow&quot; sound like &quot;yella&quot; or &quot;tomorrow&quot; like &quot;tomorra&quot;.
* Back Upglide (Chain) Shift: shifts forward and upward to (also possibly realized, variously, as ); thus allowing the back vowel to fill an area similar to the former position of /aʊ/ in the mouth, becoming lowered and developing an upglide [ɑɒ]; this, in turn, allows (though only for the most advanced Southern speakers) the upgliding , before , to lose its glide (for instance, causing the word &quot;boils&quot; to sound something like the British or New York City pronunciations of ).
* The vowel , as in &quot;bug, luck, strut,&quot; etc., is realized as , occasionally fronted to or raised in the mouth to .
* becomes before , for example &quot;wasn&#x27;t&quot;, &quot;business&quot;, but &quot;hasn&#x27;t&quot; may keep the [z] to avoid merging with &quot;hadn&#x27;t&quot;.
* Many nouns are stressed on the first syllable that is stressed on the second syllable in most other American accents, such as &quot;police&quot;, &quot;cement&quot;, &quot;Detroit&quot;, &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, &quot;insurance&quot;, &quot;behind&quot;, &quot;display&quot;, &quot;hotel&quot;, &quot;motel&quot;, &quot;recycle&quot;, &quot;TV&quot;, &quot;guitar&quot;, &quot;July&quot;, and &quot;umbrella&quot;. Today, younger Southerners tend to keep this initial stress only for a more reduced set of words, perhaps including only &quot;insurance&quot;, &quot;defense&quot;, &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, and &quot;umbrella&quot;.
*Phonemic incidence is sometimes unique in the South, so that:
**&quot;Florida&quot; is typically pronounced (particularly along the East Coast) rather than General American , and &quot;lawyer&quot; is rather than General American (i.e., the first syllable of &quot;lawyer&quot; sounds like &quot;law&quot;, not &quot;loy&quot;).
**The suffixed, unstressed &quot;-day&quot; in words like &quot;Monday&quot; and &quot;Sunday&quot; is commonly .
* Lacking or incomplete &quot;happy&quot; tensing: unstressed, word-final (the second vowel sound in words like &quot;happy, money, Chelsea,&quot; etc.) may continue to be lax, unlike the tensed (higher and fronter) vowel typical throughout rest of the United States. The South maintains a sound not always tensed: or .
*Variable horse–hoarse merger: the merger of the phonemes (as in &quot;morning&quot;) and (as in &quot;mourning&quot;) is common, as in most English dialects, though a distinction is still preserved especially in Southern accents along the Gulf Coast, plus scatterings elsewhere; thus, &quot;morning&quot; versus &quot;mourning&quot; .

===Inland South and Texas===

William Labov et al. identify the &quot;Inland South&quot; as a large linguistic sub-region of the South located mostly in southern Appalachia (specifically naming the cities of Greenville, South Carolina, Asheville, North Carolina, Knoxville and Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Birmingham and Linden, Alabama), inland from both the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts, and the originating region of the Southern Vowel Shift. The Inland South, along with the &quot;Texas South&quot; (an urban core of central Texas: Dallas, Lubbock, Odessa, and San Antonio) are considered the two major locations in which the Southern regional sound system is the most highly developed, and therefore the core areas of the current-day South as a dialect region.

The accents of Texas are diverse, for example with important Spanish influences on its vocabulary; however, much of the state is still an unambiguous region of modern rhotic Southern speech, strongest in the cities of Dallas, Lubbock, Odessa, and San Antonio, which all firmly demonstrate the first stage of the Southern Shift, if not also further stages of the shift. Texan cities that are noticeably &quot;non-Southern&quot; dialectally are Abilene and Austin; only marginally Southern are Houston, El Paso, and Corpus Christi. In western and northern Texas, the cot–caught merger is very close to completed.

===Distinct phonologies===

====Cajun====

Most of southern Louisiana constitutes Acadiana, a cultural region dominated for hundreds of years by monolingual speakers of Cajun French, which combines elements of Acadian French with other French and Spanish words. Today, this French dialect is spoken by many older Cajun ethnic group members and is said to be dying out. A related language, Louisiana Creole French, also exists. Since the early 1900s, Cajuns additionally began to develop their vernacular dialect of English, which retains some influences and words from French, such as &quot;cher&quot; (dear) or &quot;nonc&quot; (uncle). This dialect fell out of fashion after World War II but experienced a renewal among primarily male speakers born since the 1970s, who have been the most attracted by, and the biggest attractors of, a successful Cajun cultural renaissance. The accent includes:
* variable non-rhoticity (or &quot;r&quot;-dropping)
* high nasalization (including in vowels before nasal consonants)
* deletion of any word&#x27;s final consonant(s) (&quot;hand&quot; becomes , &quot;food&quot; becomes , &quot;rent&quot; becomes , &quot;New York&quot; becomes , etc.)
* a potential for glide weakening in all gliding vowels; for example, (as in &quot;Joe&quot;), (as in &quot;Jay&quot;), and (as in &quot;Joy&quot;) have glides (, , and , respectively)
* the cot–caught merger toward 

Cajun English is not subject to the Southern Vowel Shift.

====New Orleans====

A separate historical English dialect from the above Cajun one, spoken only by those raised in the Greater New Orleans area, is traditionally non-rhotic and noticeably shares more pronunciation commonalities with a New York accent than with other Southern accents, due to commercial ties and cultural migration between the two cities. Since at least the 1980s, this local New Orleans dialect has popularly been called &quot;Yat&quot;, from the common local greeting &quot;Where you at?&quot;. Some features that the New York accent shares with the Yat accent include: 
*variable non-rhoticity
*short-&quot;a&quot; split system (so that &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;back&quot;, for example, have different vowels)
* as high gliding 
* as rounded 
*the coil–curl merger (traditionally, though now in decline). 
*Canadian raising of both and (mainly among younger speakers)
Yat also lacks the typical vowel changes of the Southern Shift and the pin–pen merger that is commonly heard elsewhere throughout the South. Yat is associated with the working and lower-middle classes, and a spectrum of speech patterns with fewer notable Yat features is often heard among those of higher socioeconomic status; such New Orleans affluence is associated with the New Orleans Uptown and the Garden District, whose speech patterns are sometimes considered distinct from the lower-class Yat dialect.

====Other Southern cities====
:&quot;See also: &quot;

Some sub-regions of the South, and perhaps even a majority of the biggest cities, are showing a gradual shift away from the Southern accent (toward a more Midland or General American accent) since the second half of the 20th century to the present. Such well-studied cities include Houston, Texas, and Raleigh, North Carolina; in Raleigh, for example, this retreat from the accent appears to have begun around 1950. 

Other sub-regions are unique in that their inhabitants have never spoken with the Southern regional accent, instead having their own distinct accents. The 2006 &quot;Atlas of North American English&quot; identifies Atlanta, Georgia, as a dialectal &quot;island of non-Southern speech&quot;, Charleston, South Carolina, likewise as &quot;not markedly Southern in character&quot;, and the traditional local accent of Savannah, Georgia, as &quot;giving way to regional [Midland] patterns&quot;, despite these being three prominent Southern cities. The dialect features of Atlanta are best described today as sporadic from speaker to speaker, with such variation increased due to a huge movement of non-Southerners into the area during the 1990s. Modern-day Charleston speakers have leveled in the direction of a more generalized Midland accent (and speakers in other Southern cities too like Greenville, Richmond, and Norfolk), away from the city&#x27;s now-defunct, traditional Charleston accent, whose features were &quot;diametrically opposed to the Southern Shift... and differ in many other respects from the main body of Southern dialects&quot;. The Savannah accent is also becoming more Midland-like. The following vowel sounds of Atlanta, Charleston, and Savannah have been unaffected by typical Southern phenomena like the Southern drawl and Southern Vowel Shift: 
* as in &quot;bad&quot; (the &quot;default&quot; General American nasal short-&quot;a&quot; system is in use, in which is tensed only before or ).
* as in &quot;bide&quot; (however, some Atlanta and Savannah speakers do variably show Southern glide weakening).
* as in &quot;bait&quot;.
* as in &quot;bed&quot;.
* as in &quot;bid&quot;.
* as in &quot;bead&quot;.
* as in &quot;bought&quot; (which is lowered, as in most of the U.S., and approaches ; the cot–caught merger is mostly at a transitional stage in these cities).
Today, the accents of Atlanta, Charleston, and Savannah are most similar to the Midland regional accent or at least the larger Southeastern super-regional accent. In all three cities, some speakers (though most consistently documented in Charleston and least consistently in Savannah) demonstrate the Southeastern fronting of and the status of the pin–pen merger is highly variable. Non-rhoticity (&quot;r&quot;-dropping) is now rare in these cities, yet still documented in some speakers.

==Older phonologies==

Before becoming a phonologically unified dialect region, the South was once home to an array of much more diverse accents at the local level. Features of the deeper interior Appalachian South largely became the basis for the newer Southern regional dialect; thus, older Southern American English primarily refers to the English spoken outside of Appalachia: the coastal and former plantation areas of the South, best documented before the Civil War, on the decline during the early 1900s, and non-existent in speakers born since the civil rights movement.

Little unified these older Southern dialects since they never formed a single homogeneous dialect region to begin with. Some older Southern accents were rhotic (most strongly in Appalachia and west of the Mississippi), while the majority were non-rhotic (most strongly in plantation areas); however, wide variation existed. Some older Southern accents showed (or approximated) Stage 1 of the Southern Vowel Shift—namely, the glide weakening of —however, it is virtually unreported before the very late 1800s. In general, the older Southern dialects lacked the Mary–marry–merry, cot–caught, horse–hoarse, wine–whine, full–fool, fill–feel, and do–dew mergers, all of which are now common to, or encroaching on, all varieties of present-day Southern American English. Older Southern sound systems included those local to the:
*Plantation South (excluding the Lowcountry): phonologically characterized by glide weakening, non-rhoticity (for some accents, including a coil–curl merger), and the Southern trap–bath split (a version of the trap–bath split unique to older Southern U.S. speech that causes words like &quot;lass&quot; not to rhyme with words like &quot;pass&quot; ).
**Eastern and central Virginia (often identified as the &quot;Tidewater accent&quot;): further characterized by Canadian raising and some vestigial resistance to the vein–vain merger.
*Lowcountry (of South Carolina and Georgia; often identified as the traditional &quot;Charleston accent&quot;): characterized by no glide weakening, non-rhoticity (including the coil-curl merger), the Southern trap–bath split, Canadian raising, the cheer–chair merger, pronounced as , and pronounced as .
*Outer Banks and Chesapeake Bay (often identified as the &quot;Hoi Toider accent&quot;): characterized by no glide weakening (with the on-glide strongly backed, unlike any other U.S. dialect), the card–cord merger, pronounced as , and up-gliding of pure vowels especially before (making &quot;fish&quot; sound almost like &quot;feesh&quot; and &quot;ash&quot; like &quot;aysh&quot;). It is the only dialect of the older South still extant on the East Coast, due to being passed on through generations of geographically isolated islanders.
*Appalachian and Ozark Mountains: characterized by strong rhoticity and a tor–tore–tour merger (which still exists in that region), the Southern trap–bath split, plus the original and most advanced instances of the Southern Vowel Shift now defining the whole South.

==Grammar==
These grammatical features are characteristic of both older and newer Southern American English.

* Use of &quot;done&quot; as an auxiliary verb between the subject and verb in sentences conveying the past tense.
*:I done told you before.
* Use of &quot;done&quot; (instead of &quot;did&quot;) as the past simple form of &quot;do&quot;, and similar uses of the past participle in place of the past simple, such as &quot;seen&quot; replacing &quot;saw&quot; as past simple form of &quot;see.&quot;
*:I only done what you done told me.
*:I seen her first.
* Use of other non-standard preterites, Such as &quot;drownded&quot; as the past tense of &quot;drown&quot;, &quot;knowed&quot; as the past tense of &quot;know&quot;, &quot;choosed&quot; as the past tense of &quot;choose&quot;, &quot;degradated&quot; as the past tense of &quot;degrade&quot;.
*:I knowed you for a fool soon as I seen you.
* Use of &quot;been&quot; instead of &quot;have been&quot; in perfect constructions.
*:I been livin&#x27; here darn near my whole life.
* Use of &quot;(a-) fixin&#x27; to&quot;, with several spelling variants such as &quot;fixing to&quot; or &quot;fixinta&quot;, to indicate immediate future action; in other words: &quot;intending to&quot;, &quot;preparing to&quot;, or &quot;about to&quot;.
*:He&#x27;s fixin&#x27; to eat.
*:They&#x27;re fixing to go for a hike.
:It is not clear where the term comes from and when it was first used. According to dialect dictionaries, &quot;fixin&#x27; to&quot; is associated with Southern speech, most often defined as being a synonym of &quot;preparing to&quot; or &quot;intending to&quot;. Some linguists, e.g. Marvin K. Ching, regard it as being a &quot;quasimodal&quot; rather than a verb followed by an infinitive. It is a term used by all social groups, although more frequently by people with a lower social status than by members of the educated upper classes. Furthermore, it is more common in the speech of younger people than in that of older people. Like much of the Southern dialect, the term is also more prevalent in rural areas than in urban areas.
* Preservation of older English &quot;me,&quot; &quot;him,&quot; etc. as reflexive datives.
*:I&#x27;m fixin&#x27; to paint me a picture.
*:He&#x27;s gonna catch him a big one.
* Saying &quot;this here&quot; in place of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;this one&quot;, and &quot;that there&quot; in place of &quot;that&quot; or &quot;that one&quot;.
*:This here&#x27;s mine and that there is yours.
* Existential &quot;it,&quot; a feature dating from Middle English which can be explained as by substituting &quot;it&quot; for &quot;there&quot; when &quot;there&quot; refers to no physical location, but only to the existence of something.
*:It&#x27;s one lady who lives in town.
*:It is nothing more to say.
Standard English would prefer &quot;existential &quot;there&quot;&quot;, as in &quot;There&#x27;s one lady who lives in town&quot;. This construction is used to say that something exists (rather than saying where it is located). The construction can be found in Middle English as in Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Edward II&quot;: &quot;Cousin, it is no dealing with him now&quot;.
* Use of &quot;ever&quot; in place of &quot;every&quot;.
*:Ever&#x27;where&#x27;s the same these days.
*Using &quot;liketa&quot; (sometimes spelled as &quot;liked to&quot; or &quot;like to&quot;) to mean &quot;almost&quot;.
*:I liketa died.
*:He liketa got hit by a car.
:Liketa is presumably a conjunction of &quot;like to&quot; or &quot;like to have&quot; coming from Appalachian English. It is most often seen as a synonym for almost. Accordingly, the phrase &quot;I like&#x27;t&#x27;a died&quot; would be &quot;I almost died&quot; in Standard English. With this meaning, &quot;liketa&quot; can be seen as a verb modifier for actions that are on the verge of happening. Furthermore, it is more often used in an exaggerated or violent figurative sense rather than a literal sense.
*Use of the distal demonstrative &quot;yonder,&quot; archaic in most dialects of English, to indicate a third, larger degree of distance beyond both &quot;here&quot; and &quot;there&quot; (thus relegating &quot;there&quot; to a medial demonstrative as in some other languages), indicating that something is a longer way away, and to a lesser extent, in a wide or loosely defined expanse, as in the church hymn &quot;When the Roll Is Called Up Yonder&quot;. A typical example is the use of &quot;over yonder&quot; in place of &quot;over there&quot; or &quot;in or at that indicated place&quot;, especially to refer to a particularly different spot, such as in &quot;the house over yonder&quot;.
* Compared to General American English, when contracting a negated auxiliary verb, Southern American English has an increased preference for contracting the subject and the auxiliary than the auxiliary and &quot;not&quot;, e.g. the first of the following pairs:
*:&quot;He&#x27;s&quot; not here. / He &quot;isn&#x27;t&quot; here.
*:&quot;I&#x27;ve&quot; not been there. / I &quot;haven&#x27;t&quot; been there.

===Multiple modals===
Standard English has a strict word order. In the case of modal auxiliaries, standard English is restricted to a single modal per verb phrase. However, some Southern speakers use double or more modals in a row (&quot;might could, might should, might would, used to could,&quot; etc.--also called &quot;modal stacking&quot;) and sometimes even triple modals that involve &quot;oughta&quot; (like &quot;might should oughta&quot;)
*I might could climb to the top.
*I used to could do that. 
The origin of multiple modals is controversial; some say it is a development of Modern English, while others trace them back to Middle English and others to Scots-Irish settlers. There are different opinions on which class preferably uses the term. for example, finds that educated people try to avoid multiple modals, whereas suggests the opposite. In some Southern regions, multiple modals are quite widespread and not particularly stigmatized. Possible multiple modals are:
As the table shows, there are only possible combinations of an epistemic modal followed by deontic modals in multiple modal constructions. Deontic modals express permissibility with a range from obligated to forbidden and are mostly used as markers of politeness in requests whereas epistemic modals refer to probabilities from certain to impossible. Multiple modals combine these two modalities.

===Conditional syntax and evidentiality===
People from the South often make use of conditional or evidential syntaxes as shown below (italicized in the examples):

Conditional syntax in requests:
:&quot;I guess you could&quot; step out and git some toothpicks and a carton of Camel cigarettes &quot;if you a mind to&quot;.
:&quot;If you be good enough to take it, I believe&quot; I could stand me a taste.

Conditional syntax in suggestions:
:I wouldn&#x27;t look for &#x27;em to show up &quot;if I was you&quot;.
:&quot;I&#x27;d think&quot; that whiskey &quot;would be&quot; a trifle hot.
Conditional syntax creates a distance between the speaker&#x27;s claim and the hearer. It serves to soften obligations or suggestions, make criticisms less personal, and to overall express politeness, respect, or courtesy.

Southerners also often use &quot;evidential&quot; predicates such as think, reckon, believe, guess, have the feeling, etc.:
:You already said that once, &quot;I believe&quot;.
:&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t want to guess, but I have the feeling&quot; we&#x27;ll know soon enough.
:&quot;You reckon&quot; we oughta get help?
:I &quot;don&#x27;t believe&quot; I&#x27;ve ever known one.

Evidential predicates indicate an uncertainty of the knowledge asserted in the sentence. According to , evidential predicates nearly always hedge the assertions and allow the respondents to hedge theirs. They protect speakers from the social embarrassment that appears, in case the assertion turns out to be wrong. As is the case with conditional syntax, evidential predicates can also be used to soften criticisms and to afford courtesy or respect.

==Vocabulary==
In the United States, the following vocabulary is mostly unique to, or best associated with, Southern U.S. English:
*&quot;Ain&#x27;t&quot; to mean &quot;am not&quot;, &quot;is not&quot;, &quot;are not&quot;, &quot;have not&quot;, &quot;has not&quot;, etc.

*&quot;Carry&quot; to additionally mean &quot;escort&quot; or &quot;accompany&quot;
*&quot;Catty-corner&quot; to mean &quot;located or placed diagonally&quot;
*&quot;Chill bumps&quot; as a synonym for &quot;goose bumps&quot;
*&quot;Coke&quot; to mean any sweet, carbonated soft drink

Unique words can occur as Southern nonstandard past-tense forms of verbs, particularly in the Southern highlands and Piney Woods, as in &quot;yesterday they riz up, come outside, drawed, and drownded&quot;, as well as participle forms like &quot;they have took it, rode it, blowed it up, and swimmed away&quot;. &quot;Drug&quot; is traditionally both the past tense and participle form of the verb &quot;drag&quot;.

===Y&#x27;all===

===Southern Louisiana===

Southern Louisiana English especially is known for some unique vocabulary: long sandwiches are often called &quot;poor boys&quot; or &quot;po&#x27; boys&quot;, woodlice/roly-polies called &quot;doodle bugs&quot;, the end of a bread loaf called a &quot;nose&quot;, pedestrian islands and median strips alike called &quot;neutral ground&quot;, and sidewalks called &quot;banquettes&quot;.

==Relationship to African-American English==

Discussion of &quot;Southern dialect&quot; in the United States sometimes focuses on those English varieties spoken by white Southerners; However, because &quot;Southern&quot; is a geographic term, &quot;Southern dialect&quot; may also encompass dialects developed among other social or ethnic groups in the South. The most prominent of these dialects is African-American Vernacular English (AAVE), a fairly unified variety of English spoken by working and middle-class African-Americans throughout the United States. AAVE exhibits a relationship with both older and newer Southern dialects, though there is not yet a broad consensus on the exact nature of this relationship.

The historical context of race and slavery in the United States is a central factor in the development of AAVE. From the 16th to 19th centuries, many Africans speaking a diversity of West African languages were captured, brought to the United States, and sold into slavery. Over many generations, these Africans and their African-American descendants picked up English to communicate with their white enslavers and the white servants that they sometimes worked alongside, and they also used English as a bridge language to communicate with each other in the absence of another common language. There were also some African Americans living as free people in the United States, though the majority lived outside of the South due to Southern state laws which enabled white enslavers to &quot;recapture&quot; anyone not perceived as white and force them into slavery.

Following the American Civil War – and the subsequent national abolition of explicitly racial slavery in the 19th century – many newly freed African Americans and their families remained in the United States. Some stayed in the South, while others moved to join communities of African-American free people living outside of the South. Soon, racial segregation laws followed by decades of cultural, sociological, economic, and technological changes such as WWII and the increasing prevalence of mass media further complicated the relationship between AAVE and all other English dialects.

Modern AAVE retains similarities to older speech patterns spoken among white Southerners. Many features suggest that it largely developed from nonstandard dialects of colonial English as spoken by white Southern planters and British indentured servants, plus a more minor influence from the creoles and pidgins spoken by Black Caribbeans. There is also evidence of some influence of West African languages on the vocabulary and grammar of AAVE.

It is uncertain to what extent current white Southern English borrowed elements from early AAVE, and vice versa. Like many white accents of English once spoken in Southern plantation areas—namely, the Lowcountry, the Virginia Piedmont, Tidewater, and the lower Mississippi Valley—the modern-day AAVE accent is mostly non-rhotic (or &quot;&quot;r&quot;-dropping&quot;). The presence of non-rhoticity in both AAVE and old Southern English is not merely coincidence, though, again, which dialect influenced which is unknown. It is better documented, however, that white Southerners borrowed some morphological processes from Black Southerners.

Many grammatical features were used alike by white speakers of old Southern English and early AAVE, more so than by contemporary speakers of the same two varieties. Even so, contemporary speakers of both continue to share these unique grammatical features: &quot;existential &quot;it&quot;&quot;, the word &quot;y&#x27;all&quot;, double negatives, &quot;was&quot; to mean &quot;were&quot;, deletion of &quot;had&quot; and &quot;have&quot;, &quot;them&quot; to mean &quot;those&quot;, the term &quot;fixin&#x27; to&quot;, stressing the first syllable of words like &quot;hotel&quot; or &quot;guitar&quot;, and many others. Both dialects also continue to share these same pronunciation features: tensing, raising, upgliding , the pin–pen merger, and the most defining sound of the current Southern accent (though rarely documented in older Southern accents): the glide weakening of . However, while this glide weakening has triggered among white Southerners a complicated &quot;Southern Vowel Shift&quot;, African-American speakers in the South and elsewhere are &quot;not participating or barely participating&quot; in much of this shift. AAVE speakers also do not front the vowel starting positions of and , thus aligning these characteristics more with the speech of 19th-century white Southerners than 20th-century white Southerners.

Another possible influence on the divergence of AAVE and white Southern American English (i.e., the disappearance of older Southern American English) is that historical and contemporary civil rights struggles have over time caused the two racial groups &quot;to stigmatize linguistic variables associated with the other group&quot;. This may explain some of the differences outlined above, including why most traditionally non-rhotic white Southern accents have shifted to become intensely rhotic.

==Social perceptions==
In the United States, there is a general negative stigma surrounding the Southern dialect. Non–Southern Americans tend to associate a Southern accent with lower social and economic status, cognitive and verbal slowness, lack of education, ignorance, bigotry, or religious or political conservatism, using common labels like &quot;&quot;, &quot;hillbilly&quot;, or &quot;redneck accent&quot;. Meanwhile, Southerners themselves tend to have mixed judgments of their accent, some similarly negative but others positively associating it with a laid-back, plain, or humble attitude. The accent is also associated nationwide with the military, NASCAR, and country music. Furthermore, non–Southern American country singers typically imitate a Southern accent in their music. The sum of negative associations nationwide, however, is the main presumable cause of a gradual decline of Southern accent features, since the middle of the 20th century onwards, particularly among younger and more urban residents of the South.

In a study of children&#x27;s attitudes about accents published in 2012, Tennessee children from five to six were indifferent about the qualities of persons with different accents, but children from Chicago were not. Chicago children from five to six (speakers of Northern American English) were much more likely to attach positive traits to Northern speakers than Southern ones. The study&#x27;s results suggest that social perceptions of Southern English are taught by parents to children.

In 2014, the US Department of Energy at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee offered a voluntary &quot;Southern accent reduction&quot; class so that employees could be &quot;remembered for what they said rather than their accents&quot;. The course offered accent neutralization through code-switching. The class was canceled because of the resulting controversy and complaints from Southern employees, who were offended by the class since it stigmatized Southern accents.

<doc id="627178" wikidata="Q1780002" url="?curid=627178" title="Comitology">
<text>Comitology in the European Union (EU) refers to a process by which EU law is implemented or adjusted by the European Commission working in conjunction with committees of national representatives (at civil service level) from the EU member states, colloquially called &quot;comitology committees&quot;. These are chaired by the European Commission. The official term for the process is committee procedure. Comitology committees are part of the EU&#x27;s broader system of committees that assist in the making, adoption, and implementation of EU laws.

The Treaty of Lisbon reconfigured comitology system, distinguishing between:
* &quot;delegated acts&quot; (where the Council and the Parliament empower the Commission to adjust and amend the details of legislation they have adopted, subject to them not vetoing them), and 
* &quot;implementing acts&quot;, where the Commission may adopt measures to implement the detail of the legislation (working with &quot;comitology&quot; committees).

This is codified in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU respectively.

==Background and history==
All legislatures have a system of delegating detailed implementing measures to the executive. At EU level too, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union can confer such powers on the Commission. However, the Commission must act in conjunction with committees of representatives of member states who often have the power to block the Commission and refer the matter to the Council.

It is the confusing number of committees that gave rise to the term &quot;comitology&quot;. A report from the British House of Lords said, &quot;There is no definitive list of comitology committees, their functions, activities and membership&quot;; however, since the European Commission started to maintain a list, it states that &quot;A list of &#x27;comitology&#x27; committees [...] is published as an Annex to the Annual reports on the work of these Committees [...] as well as in the Register of Comitology.&quot; Moreover, the strongest criticism pertained to the fact that the elected European Parliament (EP) had no right to block implementing measures: only the comitology committees could do so, and if they did, the proposal was referred to Council alone, even when the initial delegation of powers was through an act adopted jointly by both Parliament and Council under the co-decision procedure. Parliament argued that the system lacked transparency and democratic control.
After years of complaint by Parliament, a significant reform placing Parliament and Council on an equal footing was to be introduced by the Constitutional Treaty. Since the latter did not get ratified, the Parliament insisted that the envisaged changes would be introduced through secondary law. An agreement was reached in 2006 and a new procedure, the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, was introduced, to be used when non-essential elements of EU legislation adopted under the co-decision procedure required amendment or supplementation.

The procedure gives Parliament and Council a period (normally of three months) to examine proposals that have been through a comitology committee. If Parliament objects to a proposal, the Commission cannot enact it. Instead, the Commission can either make a new proposal, taking account of the reasons for the objection (in which case the clock is re-set and Parliament can again block), or it can propose new legislation to Parliament and Council under the legislative co-decision procedure.

The new procedure applies whenever Council and Parliament, under co-decision on the basic legislation, choose to confer powers on the Commission to adopt implementing measures of general scope that can be described as &quot;quasi-legislative&quot; in nature (delegated legislation). It does not apply to administrative or purely executive decisions. The system does not apply when the original legislation is not co-decision legislation. Then, the old comitology procedures (see below) can still apply.

===First comitology decision===
The comitology system was initially not foreseen under the EEC Treaty. The Single European Act introduced a legal basis for the first time and instructed the Council to adopt a Decision setting out the different procedures. This was the first Comitology decision of 1987.

===Second comitology decision===
The Parliament had also pressed for more transparency in the comitology system. On 28 June 1999 it secured the Council&#x27;s agreement in a Council of the European Union decision on procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (Decision 1999/468/EC, &quot;the Comitology Decision&quot;), which outlines &quot;advisory&quot;, &quot;management&quot;, regulatory&quot; and &quot;safeguard&quot; procedures (Articles 3 to 6 respectively).

Article 7 paragraph 5 of the Comitology Decision states that references of the documents transmitted to the Parliament should be made available to the public. The Commission was, therefore, obliged to create a register of Comitology documents and a web-based repository to the register which enables the user to obtain direct access to certain documents which also contains a link for requesting the document, if it is not made public in the repository (in accordance with the rules of the Regulation No. 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001).

The register in general contains the following types of documents:
* agendas of committee meetings,
* draft implementing measures,
* summary records of committee meetings,
* voting results of opinions delivered by a committee.

===Comitology regulation===
A new regulation on comitology, Regulation No 182/2011, was adopted pursuant to Article 291 (3) TFEU, and has been in force since 1 March 2011. This regulation lays down &quot;the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission&#x27;s exercise of implementing powers&quot;.

==Types of committee==
Under the second comitology decision of 1999 (amended in 2006) there were four categories of committee: Advisory, Management, Regulatory and, under the procedure agreed in 2006, Regulatory with Scrutiny. Advisory committees give opinions which the Commission must take account of, but it retains the power of decision. Management committees can block a proposed Commission measure by a qualified majority. A Regulatory committee needs a qualified majority to approve a proposed Commission measure. Measures not adopted are referred to the Council for a decision (or Council and Parliament under the new Regulatory committee with Scrutiny, where opposition from either will block the proposed measure).

The Comitology regulation has only retained the advisory procedure, and replaced the management and regulatory procedures with the examination procedure. Under the Lisbon Treaty, the scenarios in which the regulatory procedure with scrutiny applied are now covered by the delegated act foreseen in Article 290 TFEU. As of 2021 the regulatory procedure with scrutiny still exists however and is in the process of being phased out.

==Democratic legitimacy==
As noted above, the European Parliament has long had a problem with the lack of transparency of comitology committees, stemming mainly from the fact that Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are excluded from the comitology process. A broader concern has been voiced about the public accountability of comitology. As sites of European governance which produce a vast amount of binding legislation, comitology&#x27;s opaque mode of operation, unclear membership, and closed debate style has been the subject of criticism from both academics and practitioners.

<text>France has used many military aircraft both in the French Air and Space Force, and other branches of its armed forces. Multiple aircraft were designed and built in France, but many aircraft from elsewhere, or part of joint ventures have been used as well. Lighter-than-air aircraft such as dirigibles and balloons found use starting in the 19th century used mainly for observation. The advent of World War I saw an explosion in the number France&#x27;s aircraft, though development slowed after. While having many promising designs in development in the 1930s, government wrangling delayed development enough there was little available at the out break of World War II. The armistice in 1940 marked a low point, with Vichy France being allowed only reduced numbers and development halting. Many French aircraft were captured and used by Nazi Germany and its allies. Some aircraft that did escape served with the Allies or Free French forces, who also used many other types of allied aircraft. The cold-war saw the continued use of many other Western aircraft, mainly from the U.S., during a period of rebuilding of the aviation industry and under threat of war with the Soviet Union. Many new types woul service including the very successful Mirage series or the latest design, the Rafale.

<doc id="627181" wikidata="Q6760187" url="?curid=627181" title="Margaritaville">
<text>&quot;Margaritaville&quot; is a 1977 song by American singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, released on his seventh album, &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot;. In the United States, &quot;Margaritaville&quot; reached number eight on the &quot;Billboard &quot;Hot 100 chart, and went to number one on the Easy Listening chart, also peaking at No. 13 on the Hot Country Songs chart. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it number 14 on its 1977 Pop Singles year-end chart. It was Buffett&#x27;s highest charting solo single. After Buffett’s death on September 1, 2023, the song re-entered the Top 40 for the week ending September 16, 2023. 

Named for the cocktail margarita, with lyrics reflecting a laid-back lifestyle in a tropical climate, &quot;Margaritaville&quot; has come to define Buffett&#x27;s music and career. The relative importance of the song to Buffett&#x27;s career is referred to obliquely in a parenthetical plural in the title of a Buffett greatest hits compilation album, &quot;Songs You Know by Heart: Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s Greatest Hit(s)&quot;. The name was used in the title of other Buffett compilation albums including &quot;Meet Me in Margaritaville: The Ultimate Collection&quot; and is also the name of several commercial products licensed by Buffett. The song also lent its name to the 2017 musical &quot;Escape to Margaritaville&quot;, in which it is featured alongside other Buffett songs. Continued popular culture references to and covers of it throughout the years attest to the song&#x27;s continuing popularity. The song was mentioned in Alan Jackson&#x27;s 2003 single &quot;It&#x27;s Five O&#x27;Clock Somewhere&quot;, on which Buffett is a featured artist, and in Blake Shelton&#x27;s 2004 single &quot;Some Beach&quot;.

&quot;Margaritaville&quot; has been inducted into the 2016 Grammy Hall of Fame for its cultural and historic significance. In 2023, the song was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot; Buffett maintained a resort chain by the same name.

==Origins==
In an interview with &quot;Sound on Sound&quot; magazine, producer Norbert Putnam stated Buffett approached him with the concept of an album of light, carefree songs about life by the beach. Putnam encouraged Buffett to record the album at Criteria Studios in Miami, rather than Buffett&#x27;s usual studio in Nashville, in order to take inspiration from Miami&#x27;s easygoing beachfront lifestyle. One day during recording, Buffett complained about a bad day he recently had on the beach, which included losing one of his flip-flops on his way home from a bar, cutting his foot on a beer can pop top, and running out of salt for his margarita. Buffett was already working on a set of lyrics about the incident, to which Putnam told him, &quot;That&#x27;s a terrible idea for a song.&quot; A few days later, Buffett played a rough version of the song, then called &quot;Wasted Away Again in Margaritaville,&quot; and Putnam and others at the studio realized it had potential as a hit.

==Content==
The song is about a man spending an entire season at a beach resort community, with three verses that describe his day-to-day activities. In the first verse, he passes his time playing guitar on his front porch and watching tourists sunbathe, all the while eating sponge cake and waiting for a pot of shrimp to boil. In the second verse, he has nothing to show for his time except a tattoo of a woman that he cannot remember getting. In the third and final verse, he steps on a discarded pull-tab, cutting his heel and ruining the flip-flops he is wearing, then returns home to ease his pain with a fresh batch of margaritas. In live performances, he sang &quot;I broke my leg twice, I had to limp on back home&quot;.

The three choruses reveal that the narrator is pondering his recent failed romance, and his friends are telling him that his former girlfriend is at fault. The last line of each shows his shifting attitude toward the situation: first &quot;it&#x27;s nobody&#x27;s fault,&quot; then &quot;hell, it could be my fault,&quot; and finally &quot;it&#x27;s my own damn fault.&quot; So the overall story that the song tells is not hedonist enjoyment of life in the sun, but rather almost the opposite; it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s gradual recognition, while drowning his sorrows in alcohol, that it was his foolish actions that destroyed the chance of happiness with the woman he loved. The appeal of the song is partly the clever way this evolving story is related in just a few words at the end of each chorus.

Buffett revealed during the recording of an episode of &quot;CMT&#x27;s Crossroads&quot; with the Zac Brown Band that &quot;Margaritaville&quot; was actually supposed to be recorded by Elvis Presley, but Presley died the same year the song was released (he declined the offer before the song could be recorded).

===Lost verse===
There is a &quot;lost verse&quot; to this song, as described by Buffett, which he often added when performing in concert, which was reputedly edited out before recording the song in order to make the song more radio friendly. The song was shortened even further for the single edit:

:&quot;Old men in tank tops,&quot;
:&quot;Cruisin&#x27; the gift shops,&quot;
:&quot;Checkin&#x27; out s, down by the shore&quot;
:&quot;They dream about weight loss,&quot;
:&quot;Wish they could be their own boss&quot;
:&quot;Those three-day vacations can be (or &quot;become&quot;) such a bore&quot;

===Lyric confusion===
There is some confusion as to whether Buffett sings &quot;&quot;Wasted&quot; away&quot; or &quot;&quot;Wastin&quot;’ away&quot; in the chorus of the song. The original unedited lyrics, that appear on the record sleeve to the &quot;Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes&quot; LP, read &quot;Waistin . Also, most guitar tablature and sheet music read &quot;Wastin&#x27;.&quot; Buffett never made a statement on the issue. However, he was also known to use &quot;wasted&quot; in some performances, as well as in the video game re-recording for &quot;Rock Band&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;Buffett turns in a melodic performance that could give him his first big hit.&quot;

==Charts==

===Weekly charts===


===Year-end charts===

==Other versions==

===Single edit===
When &quot;Margaritaville&quot; was released to radio stations in 1977, the single edit ran for 3:20, cutting out the instrumental break, and the section during the third chorus and final refrain. So the song structure changed to &quot;riff-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-verse-chorus-riff&quot;, and the track itself was sped up at half-step. The original recording in the key of D would be E-flat.

===Cover versions===

In 1999, American country singer Alan Jackson covered the song on his album &quot;Under the Influence&quot;. The cover featured Buffett singing along on the third and final verse; it also peaked at No. 63 after receiving play as an album cut.

American singer Toby Keith covered it as a duet with Sammy Hagar in 2013 for his album &quot;Drinks After Work&quot;. It appeared only on the deluxe edition of the LP. This version was also included on the &quot;Sammy Hagar &amp; Friends&quot; album, also from 2013.

Jimmy Buffett also re-recorded this song as well as &quot;Cheeseburger in Paradise&quot; and &quot;Volcano&quot; specifically for &quot;Rock Band&quot; as downloadable content.

===Parodies===
In 1991, comedian Mark Eddie wrote a parody of the song titled &quot;Marijuanaville&quot;. The song appeared on the album &quot;Rock n&#x27; Roll Comedy Cuts Part II&quot; (1998).
In 2006, Kenan Thompson did a parody of the song during the Weekend Update segment on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where he plays a soldier who found out he was going to the U.S.-Mexico border, rather than Baghdad. When Amy Poehler asks him what his reaction was when he discovered he was going to the border, in the next shot, he has a Corona banner above him, a sombrero on his head. He is swaying a Corona beer bottle and singing, &quot;Wasting away again not in Iraq.&quot; 

In 2013, a parody has aired on the &quot;John Boy &amp; Billy Big Show&quot; titled &quot;Martinsville&quot;, referencing Martinsville Speedway.

<doc id="627182" wikidata="Q2664179" url="?curid=627182" title="Bargoed">
<text>Bargoed () is a town and community in the Rhymney Valley, Wales, one of the South Wales Valleys. It lies on the Rhymney River in the county borough of Caerphilly. It straddles the ancient boundary of Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, with Bargoed lying in Glamorgan and Aberbargoed in Monmouthshire. &#x27;Greater Bargoed&#x27;, as defined by the local authority Caerphilly County Borough Council, consists of the towns of Bargoed and Aberbargoed and the village of Gilfach. The combined population of these settlements is about 13,000. The town&#x27;s rugby club Bargoed RFC holds the world record for the most consecutive league wins in a row and was &quot;World Rugby&quot; magazine&#x27;s team of the year in 2005.
The town’s football team AFC Bargoed also have a rich history and finished second in the TERV Premier League 2022

==Toponymy==
The name of the town is derived from that of the River Bargoed, which itself is based on the Welsh word &quot;border, boundary&quot;. The change from Bargod to Bargoed is recorded from the sixteenth century onwards and was probably a hypercorrection under the influence of &quot;trees, woods&quot;, perhaps reinforced by nearby place names such as Pen-y-coed, Argoed and Blackwood (). The modern pronunciation of the town&#x27;s name varies depending on street, ranging from (based on ) and (based on &quot;&quot;) to the more informal .

==History==

Originally a market town, Bargoed grew into a substantial town following the opening of a colliery in 1903. Bargoed Town Hall was originally a courthouse, completed in 1911. By 1921 Bargoed had a population of 17,901; this has been steadily declining since that time, as the general demand for Welsh coal continued to fall. The colliery, which was the subject of a painting by L. S. Lowry, closed during the 1970s, and its former site is now a country park.
The town was home to a factory built by the Austin Motor Company from 1949. This was a project by Austin chairman Leonard Lord, with government funding, to employ miners suffering from pneumoconiosis, a lung disease caused by prolonged inhalation of dust. In 1945 it was estimated that 5000 miners in the South Wales region were affected by the condition to the extent that they could not work in the coal industry. The Austin factory at Bargoed became the first factory in the world where every employee was registered as disabled. Ex-miners could work at Bargoed under full-time medical supervision and with medical facilities on-site at the factory. The factory work was understandably light, with the main product being the Austin J40 children&#x27;s pedal car. The success and efficiency of the factory was such that 150 men were employed by 1953 and Austin began the manufacture of small metal pressings for its full-size cars, such as dashboard parts, car registration plates and rocker covers at Bargoed. By 1965 over 500 men, all pneumoconiosis sufferers, were working at the factory. Production of the J40 pedal cars ended in 1971 but the factory&#x27;s other work kept it open. Improving conditions in the mining industry and the slow reduction in the number of mines and workers in the region meant that the factory&#x27;s purpose began to become redundant during the 1980s. The numbers employed slowly dropped and new workers did not have to be pneumoconiosis sufferers. The end of production of the Austin A-Series engine in 1999, the rocker cover of which was made solely in Bargoed, meant that the factory (then under the ownership of the Rover Group) employing 45 people, of which only 11 were registered as disabled, closed.

==Governance==
An electoral ward with the same name exists. At the 2011 census this ward had a population of 6,196.

==Redevelopment==

The town has been undergoing a major redevelopment scheme, which included a bypass (running through the valley, with links to Bargoed town centre, Aberbargoed and Gilfach), Morrisons supermarket and petrol station, a new bus station, repaving the road though the heart of the town, a 400+ space car park, new library, 3 new offices, a relaxation area where the old bus station was on Hanbury Square, and 7 retail units. There are ongoing issues with plans for a state of the art Odeon Cinema and the site remains undeveloped (summer 2015). A redevelopment of the former Plasnewydd Hotel has created Murray&#x27;s.

The Grade II* listed Hanbury Road Baptist chapel has been converted into a public library which includes a council services helpdesk, a computer suite, a coffee lounge, and a scaled-down chapel; the pipe organ (now silent), occupies its original dominant position overlooking the main ground floor area, while the erstwhile chapel gallery houses a substantial collection of reference and other books. At the rear of the library a new mini park has been created using 40 ft flower sculptures.

The sites of the former collieries of Bargoed, Gilfach, and Britannia have been landscaped as a recreational nature park with a network of paths on either side of the Rhymney river. Figures of mine workers from these three communities have become the inspiration for wooden sculptures in the park, while in Hanbury Square a group of three immense heads of colliery workers dominates the tiered piazza.

==Transport==
The town is served by Bargoed railway station with services to Cardiff, Penarth, and Barry; Bargoed Bus Interchange is situated at the northern end of the town, with local services and routes to nearby Blackwood, Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly, and Newport among others.

The A469 by-pass road connects with the A465 Heads of the Valleys road to the north and the A470 to the south, serving Cardiff and linking with the east-west M4 motorway.

==Education==
Bargoed Grammar Technical School existed as the local grammar school before Heolddu Comprehensive School was formed. Some of the grammar school&#x27;s buildings in Park Crescent were used from the 1980s until 2002 for the valley&#x27;s first Welsh language comprehensive school, Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni, which has now moved to a new purpose-built site in Fleur-de-Lys. Primary Schools include St Gwladys Bargoed School, Park Primary School, Aberbargoed Primary School, Gilfach Fargoed Primary School and a Welsh school Ysgol Gymraeg Gilfach Fargod. Heolddu Comprehensive School serves the local area as the main secondary school.

<text>Old Norse religion, also known as Norse paganism, is a branch of Germanic religion which developed during the Proto-Norse period, when the North Germanic peoples separated into a distinct branch of the Germanic peoples. It was replaced by Christianity and forgotten during the Christianisation of Scandinavia. Scholars reconstruct aspects of North Germanic Religion by historical linguistics, archaeology, toponymy, and records left by North Germanic peoples, such as runic inscriptions in the Younger Futhark, a distinctly North Germanic extension of the runic alphabet. Numerous Old Norse works dated to the 13th-century record Norse mythology, a component of North Germanic religion.

Old Norse religion was polytheistic, entailing a belief in various gods and goddesses. These deities in Norse mythology were divided into two groups, the Æsir and the Vanir, who in some sources were said to have engaged in an ancient war until realizing that they were equally powerful. Among the most widespread deities were the gods Odin and Thor. This world was inhabited also by various other mythological races, including , dwarfs, elves, and land-wights. Norse cosmology revolved around a world tree known as Yggdrasil, with various realms existing alongside that of humans, named Midgard. These include multiple afterlife realms, several of which are controlled by a particular deity.

Transmitted through oral culture rather than through codified texts, Old Norse religion focused heavily on ritual practice, with kings and chiefs playing a central role in carrying out public acts of sacrifice. Various cultic spaces were used; initially, outdoor spaces such as groves and lakes were typically selected, but after the third century CE cult houses seem to also have been purposely built for ritual activity, although they were never widespread. Norse society also contained practitioners of &quot;Seiðr&quot;, a form of sorcery that some scholars describe as shamanistic. Various forms of burial were conducted, including both inhumation and cremation, typically accompanied by a variety of grave goods.

Throughout its history, varying levels of trans-cultural diffusion occurred among neighbouring peoples, such as the Sami and Finns. By the 12th century, Old Norse religion had been replaced by Christianity, with elements continuing into Scandinavian folklore. A revival of interest in Old Norse religion occurred amid the romanticist movement of the 19th century, during which it inspired a range of artworks. Academic research into the subject began in the early 19th century, initially influenced by the pervasive romanticist sentiment.

==Terminology==
The archaeologist Anders Andrén noted that &quot;Old Norse religion&quot; is &quot;the conventional name&quot; applied to the pre-Christian religions of Scandinavia. See for instance other terms used by scholarly sources include &quot;pre-Christian Norse religion&quot;, &quot;Norse religion&quot;, &quot;Norse paganism&quot;, &quot;Nordic paganism&quot;, &quot;Scandinavian paganism&quot;, &quot;Scandinavian heathenism&quot;, &quot;Scandinavian religion&quot;, &quot;Northern paganism&quot;, &quot;Northern heathenism&quot;, &quot;North Germanic religion&quot;, or &quot;North Germanic paganism&quot;. This Old Norse religion can be seen as part of a broader Germanic religion found across linguistically Germanic Europe; of the different forms of this Germanic religion, that of the Old Norse is the best-documented.

Rooted in ritual practice and oral tradition, Old Norse religion was fully integrated with other aspects of Norse life, including subsistence, warfare, and social interactions. Open codifications of Old Norse beliefs were either rare or non-existent. The practitioners of this belief system themselves had no term meaning &quot;religion&quot;, which was only introduced with Christianity. Following Christianity&#x27;s arrival, Old Norse terms that were used for the pre-Christian systems were &quot;forn sið&quot; (&quot;old custom&quot;) or &quot;heiðinn sið&quot; (&quot;heathen custom&quot;), terms which suggest an emphasis on rituals, actions, and behaviours rather than belief itself. The earliest known usage of the Old Norse term &quot;heiðinn&quot; is in the poem &quot;Hákonarmál&quot;; its uses here indicates that the arrival of Christianity has generated consciousness of Old Norse religion as a distinct religion.

Old Norse religion has been classed as an ethnic religion, and as a &quot;non-doctrinal community religion&quot;. It varied across time, in different regions and locales, and according to social differences. This variation is partly due to its transmission through oral culture rather than codified texts. For this reason, the archaeologists Andrén, Kristina Jennbert, and Catharina Raudvere stated that &quot;pre-Christian Norse religion is not a uniform or stable category&quot;, while the scholar Karen Bek-Pedersen noted that the &quot;Old Norse belief system should probably be conceived of in the plural, as several systems&quot;. The historian of religion Hilda Ellis Davidson stated that it would have ranged from manifestations of &quot;complex symbolism&quot; to &quot;the simple folk-beliefs of the less sophisticated&quot;.

During the Viking Age, the Norse likely regarded themselves as a more or less unified entity through their shared Germanic language, Old Norse. The scholar of Scandinavian studies Thomas A. DuBois said Old Norse religion and other pre-Christian belief systems in Northern Europe must be viewed as &quot;not as isolated, mutually exclusive language-bound entities, but as broad concepts shared across cultural and linguistic lines, conditioned by similar ecological factors and protracted economic and cultural ties&quot;. During this period, the Norse interacted closely with other ethnocultural and linguistic groups, such as the Sámi, Balto-Finns, Anglo-Saxons, Greenlandic Inuit, and various speakers of Celtic and Slavic languages. Economic, marital, and religious exchange occurred between the Norse and many of these other groups. Enslaved individuals from the British Isles were common throughout the Nordic world during the Viking Age. Different elements of Old Norse religion had different origins and histories; some aspects may derive from deep into prehistory, others only emerging following the encounter with Christianity.

==Sources==
In Hilda Ellis Davidson&#x27;s words, present-day knowledge of Old Norse religion contains &quot;vast gaps&quot;, and we must be cautious and avoid &quot;bas[ing] wild assumptions on isolated details&quot;.

===Scandinavian textual sources===
A few runic inscriptions with religious content survive from Scandinavia, particularly asking Thor to hallow or protect a memorial stone; carving his hammer on the stone also served this function.

In contrast to the few runic fragments, a considerable body of literary and historical sources survive in Old Norse manuscripts using the Latin script, all of which were created after the Christianisation of Scandinavia, the majority in Iceland. The first extensive Nordic textual source for the Old Norse Religion was the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. Some of the poetic sources, in particular, the Poetic Edda and skaldic poetry, may have been originally composed by heathens, and &quot;Hávamál&quot; contains both information on heathen mysticism and what Ursula Dronke referred to as &quot;a round-up of ritual obligations&quot;. In addition there is information about pagan beliefs and practices in the sagas, which include both historical sagas such as Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; and the , recounting the settlement and early history of Iceland, and the so-called sagas of Icelanders concerning Icelandic individuals and groups; there are also more or less fantastical legendary sagas. Many skaldic verses are preserved in sagas. Of the originally heathen works, we cannot know what changes took place either during oral transmission or as a result of their being recorded by Christians; the sagas of Icelanders, in particular, are now regarded by most scholars as more or less historical fiction rather than as detailed historical records. A large amount of mythological poetry has undoubtedly been lost.

One important written source is Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, which incorporates a manual of Norse mythology for the use of poets in constructing kennings; it also includes numerous citations, some of them the only record of lost poems, such as Þjóðólfr of Hvinir&#x27;s &quot;Haustlöng&quot;. Snorri&#x27;s Prologue eumerises the Æsir as Trojans, deriving &quot;Æsir&quot; from &quot;Asia&quot;, and some scholars have suspected that many of the stories that we only have from him are also derived from Christian medieval culture.

===Non-Scandinavian textual sources===
Additional sources remain by non-Scandinavians writing in languages other than Old Norse. The first non-Scandinavian textual source for the Old Norse Religion was Tacitus&#x27; book, the &quot;Germania&quot;, which dates back to around 100 CE and describes religious practices of several Germanic peoples, but has little coverage of Scandinavia. In the Middle Ages, several Christian commentators also wrote about Scandinavian paganism, mostly from a hostile perspective. The best known of these are Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum&quot; (History of the Bishops of Hamburg), written between 1066 and 1072, which includes an account of the temple at Uppsala, and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27; 12th-century &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot; (History of the Danes), which includes versions of Norse myths and some material on pagan religious practices. In addition, Muslim Arabs wrote accounts of Norse people they encountered, the best known of which is Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s 10th-century &quot;Risala&quot;, an account of Volga Viking traders that includes a detailed description of a ship burial.

===Archaeological and toponymic evidence===
Since the literary evidence that represents Old Norse sources were recorded by Christians, archaeological evidence, especially of religious sites and burials is of great importance, particularly as a source of information on Norse religion before the conversion. Many aspects of material culture—including settlement locations, artefacts and buildings—may cast light on beliefs, and archaeological evidence regarding religious practices indicates chronological, geographic and class differences far greater than are suggested by the surviving texts.

Place names are an additional source of evidence. Theophoric place names, including instances where a pair of deity names occur near, provide an indication of the importance of the religion of those deities in different areas, dating back to before our earliest written sources. The toponymic evidence shows considerable regional variation, and some deities, such as Ullr and Hǫrn, occur more frequently, than Odin place-names occur, in other locations.

Some place-names contain elements indicating that they were sites of religious activity: those formed with -&quot;vé&quot;, -&quot;hörgr&quot;, and -&quot;hof&quot;, words for religious sites of various kinds, and also likely those formed with -&quot;akr&quot; or -&quot;vin&quot;, words for &quot;field&quot;, when coupled with the name of a deity. Magnus Olsen developed a typology of such place names in Norway, from which he posited a development in pagan worship from groves and fields toward the use of temple buildings.

Personal names are also a source of information on the popularity of certain deities; for example, Thor&#x27;s name was an element in the names of both men and women, particularly in Iceland.

==Historical development==
===Iron Age origins===
Andrén described Old Norse religion as a &quot;cultural patchwork&quot; which emerged under a wide range of influences from earlier Scandinavian religions. It may have had links to Nordic Bronze Age: while the putatively solar-oriented belief system of Bronze Age Scandinavia is believed to have died out around 500 BCE, several Bronze Age motifs—such as the wheel cross—reappear in later Iron Age contexts. It is often regarded as having developed from earlier religious belief systems found among the Germanic Iron Age peoples. The Germanic languages likely emerged in the first millennium BCE in present-day Denmark or northern Germany, after which they spread; several of the deities in Old Norse religion have parallels among other Germanic societies. The Scandinavian Iron Age began around 500 to 400 BCE.

Archaeological evidence is particularly important for understanding these early periods. Accounts from this time were produced by Tacitus; according to the scholar Gabriel Turville-Petre, Tacitus&#x27; observations &quot;help to explain&quot; later Old Norse religion. Tacitus described the Germanic peoples as having priests, open-air sacred sites, and seasonal sacrifices and feasts. Tacitus notes that the Germanic peoples were polytheistic and mentions some of their deities trying to perceive them through Roman equivalents, so Romans could try to understand.

===Viking Age expansion===
During the Viking Age, Norse people left Scandinavia and settled elsewhere throughout Northwestern Europe. Some of these areas, such as Iceland, the Orkney and Shetland Islands, and the Faroe Islands, were hardly populated, whereas other areas, such as England, Southwest Wales, Scotland, the Western Isles, Isle of Man, and Ireland, were already heavily populated.

In the 870s, Norwegian settlers left their homeland and colonized Iceland, bringing their belief system with them. Place-name evidence suggests that Thor was the most popular god on the island, although there are also saga accounts of devotés of Freyr in Iceland, including a &quot;priest of Freyr&quot; in the later &quot;Hrafnkels saga&quot;. There are no place-names connected to Odin on the island. Unlike other Nordic societies, Iceland lacked a monarchy and thus a centralising authority which could enforce religious adherence; there were both Old Norse and Christian communities from the time of its first settlement.

Scandinavian settlers brought Old Norse religion to Britain in the latter decades of the ninth century. Several British place-names indicate possible religious sites; for instance, Roseberry Topping in North Yorkshire was known as Othensberg in the twelfth century, a name deriving from the Old Norse &quot;Óðinsberg&quot; (&quot;Hill of Óðin&quot;). Several place-names also contain Old Norse references to religious entities, such as &quot;alfr&quot;, &quot;skratii&quot;, and &quot;troll&quot;. The English church found itself in need of conducting a new conversion process to Christianise this incoming population.

===Christianisation and decline===
The Nordic world first encountered Christianity through its settlements in the already Christian British Isles and through trade contacts with the eastern Christians in Novgorod and Byzantium. By the time Christianity arrived in Scandinavia it was already the accepted religion across most of Europe. It is not well understood how the Christian institutions converted these Scandinavian settlers, in part due to a lack of textual descriptions of this conversion process equivalent to Bede&#x27;s description of the earlier Anglo-Saxon conversion. However, it appears that the Scandinavian migrants had converted to Christianity within the first few decades of their arrival. After Christian missionaries from the British Isles—including figures like St Willibrord, St Boniface, and Willehad—had travelled to parts of northern Europe in the eighth century, Charlemagne pushed for Christianisation in Denmark, with Ebbo of Rheims, Halitgar of Cambrai, and Willeric of Bremen proselytizing in the kingdom during the ninth century. The Danish king Harald Klak converted (826), likely to secure his political alliance with Louis the Pious against his rivals for the throne. The Danish monarchy reverted to Old Norse religion under Horik II (854 – c. 867).

The Norwegian king Hákon the Good had converted to Christianity while in England. On returning to Norway, he kept his faith largely private but encouraged Christian priests to preach among the population; some pagans were angered and—according to &quot;Heimskringla&quot;—three churches built near Trondheim were burned down. His successor, Harald Greycloak, was also a Christian but similarly had little success in converting the Norwegian population to his religion. Haakon Sigurdsson later became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of Norway, and although he agreed to be baptised under pressure from the Danish king and allowed Christians to preach in the kingdom, he enthusiastically supported pagan sacrificial customs, asserting the superiority of the traditional deities and encouraging Christians to return to their veneration. His reign (975–995) saw the emergence of a &quot;state paganism&quot;, an official ideology which bound together Norwegian identity with pagan identity and rallied support behind Haakon&#x27;s leadership. Haakon was killed in 995 and Olaf Tryggvason, the next king, took power and enthusiastically promoted Christianity; he forced high-status Norwegians to convert, destroyed temples, and killed those he called &#x27;sorcerers&#x27;. Sweden was the last Scandinavian country to officially convert; although little is known about the process of Christianisation, it is known that the Swedish kings had converted by the early 11th century and that the country was fully Christian by the early 12th.

Olaf Tryggvason sent a Saxon missionary, Þangbrandr, to Iceland. Many Icelanders were angered by Þangbrandr&#x27;s proselytising, and he was outlawed after killing several poets who insulted him. Animosity between Christians and pagans on the island grew, and at the Althing in 998 both sides blasphemed each other&#x27;s gods. In an attempt to preserve unity, at the Althing in 999, an agreement was reached that the Icelandic law would be based on Christian principles, albeit with concessions to the pagan community. Private, albeit not public, pagan sacrifices and rites were to remain legal.

Across Germanic Europe, conversion to Christianity was closely connected to social ties; mass conversion was the norm, rather than individual conversion. A primary motivation for kings converting was the desire for support from Christian rulers, whether as money, imperial sanction, or military support.
Christian missionaries found it difficult convincing Norse people that the two belief systems were mutually exclusive; the polytheistic nature of Old Norse religion allowed its practitioners to accept Jesus Christ as one god among many.
The encounter with Christianity could also stimulate new and innovative expressions of pagan culture, for instance through influencing various pagan myths. As with other Germanic societies, syncretisation between incoming and traditional belief systems took place. For those living in isolated areas, pre-Christian beliefs likely survived longer, while others continued as survivals in folklore.

===Post-Christian survivals===
By the 12th century, Christianity was firmly established across Northwestern Europe. For two centuries, Scandinavian ecclesiastics continued to condemn paganism, although it is unclear whether it still constituted a viable alternative to Christian dominance. These writers often presented paganism as being based on deceit or delusion; some stated that the Old Norse gods had been humans falsely euhemerised as deities.

Old Norse mythological stories survived in oral culture for at least two centuries, being recorded in the 13th century. How this mythology was passed down is unclear; it is possible that pockets of pagans retained their belief system throughout the 11th and 12th centuries, or that it had survived as a cultural artefact passed down by Christians who retained the stories while rejecting any literal belief in them. The historian Judith Jesch suggested that following Christianisation, there remained a &quot;cultural paganism&quot;, the re-use of pre-Christian myth &quot;in certain cultural and social contexts&quot; that are officially Christian. For instance, Old Norse mythological themes and motifs appear in poetry composed for the court of Cnut the Great, an eleventh-century Christian Anglo-Scandinavian king.
Saxo is the earliest medieval figure to take a revived interest in the pre-Christian beliefs of his ancestors, doing so not out of a desire to revive their faith but out of historical interest. Snorri was also part of this revived interest, examining pagan myths from his perspective as a cultural historian and mythographer. As a result, Norse mythology &quot;long outlasted any worship of or belief in the gods it depicts&quot;. There remained, however, remnants of Norse pagan rituals for centuries after Christianity became the dominant religion in Scandinavia (see Trollkyrka). Old Norse gods continued to appear in Swedish folklore up until the early 20th century. There are documented accounts of encounters with both Thor and Odin, along with a belief in Freja&#x27;s power over fertility.

==Beliefs==
Norse mythology, stories of the Norse deities, is preserved in Eddic poetry and in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s guide for skalds, the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. Depictions of some of these stories can be found on picture stones in Gotland and in other visual records including some early Christian crosses, which attests to how widely known they were. The myths were transmitted purely orally until the end of the period, and were subject to variation; one key poem, &quot;Vǫluspá&quot;, is preserved in two variant versions in different manuscripts, and Snorri&#x27;s retelling of the myths sometimes varies from the other textual sources that are preserved. There was no single authoritative version of a particular myth, and variation over time and from place to place is presumed, rather than &quot;a single unified body of thought&quot;. In particular, there may have been influences from interactions with other peoples, including northern Slavs, Finns, and Anglo-Saxons, and Christian mythology exerted an increasing influence.

===Deities===

Old Norse religion was polytheistic, with many anthropomorphic gods and goddesses, who express human emotions and in some cases are married and have children. One god, Baldr, is said in the myths to have died. Archaeological evidence on the worship of particular gods is sparse, although placenames may also indicate locations where they were venerated. For some gods, particularly Loki, there is no evidence of worship; however, this may be changed by new archaeological discoveries. Regions, communities, and social classes likely varied in the gods they venerated more or at all. There are also accounts in sagas of individuals who devoted themselves to a single deity, described as a &quot;fulltrúi&quot; or &quot;vinr&quot; (confidant, friend) as seen in Egill Skallagrímsson&#x27;s reference to his relationship with Odin in his &quot;Sonatorrek&quot;, a tenth-century skaldic poem for example. This practice has been interpreted as heathen past influenced by the Christian cult of the saints. Although our literary sources are all relatively late, there are also indications of change over time.

Norse mythological sources, particularly Snorri and &quot;Vǫluspá&quot;, differentiate between two groups of deities, the Æsir and the Vanir, who fought a war during which the Vanir broke down the walls of the Æsir&#x27;s stronghold, Asgard, and eventually made peace utilizing a truce and the exchange of hostages. Some mythographers have suggested that this myth was based on recollection of a conflict in Scandinavia between adherents of different belief systems.

Major deities among the Æsir include Thor (who is often referred to in literary texts as Asa-Thor), Odin and Týr. Very few Vanir are named in the sources: Njǫrðr, his son Freyr, and his daughter Freyja; according to Snorri all of these could be called &quot;Vanaguð&quot; (Vanir-god), and Freyja also &quot;Vanadís&quot; (Vanir-dís). The status of Loki within the pantheon is problematic, and according to &quot;Lokasenna&quot; and &quot;Vǫluspá&quot; and Snorri&#x27;s explanation, he is imprisoned beneath the earth until Ragnarok, when he will fight against the gods. As far back as 1889 Sophus Bugge suggested this was the inspiration for the myth of Lucifer.

Some of the goddesses—Skaði, Rindr, Gerðr are jötnar origins.

The general Old Norse word for the goddesses is &quot;Ásynjur&quot;, which is properly the feminine of &quot;Æsir&quot;. An old word for goddess may be &quot;dís&quot;, which is preserved as the name of a group of female supernatural beings.

===Localised and ancestral deities===
Ancestral deities were common among Finno-Ugric peoples and remained a strong presence among the Finns and Sámi after Christianisation. Ancestor veneration may have played a part in the private religious practices of Norse people in their farmsteads and villages; in the 10th century, Norwegian pagans attempted to encourage the Christian king Haakon to take part in an offering to the gods by inviting him to drink a toast to the ancestors alongside several named deities.

Þorgerðr Hölgabrúðr and Irpa appear to have been personal or family goddesses venerated by Haakon Sigurdsson, a late pagan ruler of Norway.

There are also likely to have been local and family fertility cults; there is one reported example from pagan Norway in the family cult of Vǫlsi, where a deity called Mǫrnir is invoked.

===Other beings===
The Norns are female figures who determine individuals&#x27; fate. Snorri describes them as a group of three, but he and other sources also allude to larger groups of Norns who decide the fate of newborns. It is uncertain whether they were worshipped.
The landvættir, spirits of the land, were thought to inhabit certain rocks, waterfalls, mountains, and trees, and offerings were made to them. For many, they may have been more important in daily life than the gods. Texts also mention various kinds of elves and dwarfs. Fylgjur, guardian spirits, generally female, were associated with individuals and families. Hamingjur, dísir and swanmaidens are female supernatural figures of uncertain stature within the belief system; the dísir may have functioned as tutelary goddesses. Valkyries were associated with the myths concerning Odin, and also occur in heroic poetry such as the Helgi lays, where they are depicted as princesses who assist and marry heroes.

Conflict with the and (often glossed as giants and giantesses respectively) is a frequent motif in the mythology. They are described as both the ancestors and enemies of the gods. Gods marry but &#x27;s attempts to couple with goddesses are repulsed. Most scholars believe the were not worshipped, although this has been questioned. The Eddic have parallels with their later folkloric counterparts, although unlike them they have much wisdom.

===Cosmology===

Several accounts of the Old Norse cosmogony, or creation myth, appear in surviving textual sources, but there is no evidence that these were certainly produced in the pre-Christian period. It is possible that they were developed during the encounter with Christianity, as pagans sought to establish a creation myth complex enough to rival that of Christianity; these accounts could also be the result of Christian missionaries interpreting certain elements and tales found in the Old Norse culture and presenting them to be creation myths and a cosmogony, parallel to that of the Bible, in part to aid the Old Norse in the understanding of the new Christian religion through the use of native elements as a means to facilitate conversion (a common practice employed by missionaries to ease the conversion of people from different cultures across the globe. See Syncretism). 
According to the account in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, the universe was initially a void known as Ginnungagap. There then appeared a , Ymir, and after him the gods, who lifted the earth out of the sea. A different account is provided in &quot;Vafþrúðnismál&quot;, which describes that the world is made from the components of Ymir&#x27;s body: the earth from his flesh, the mountains from his bones, the sky from his skull, and the sea from his blood. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; also describes the world being fashioned from Ymir&#x27;s corpse, although adds the detail that the emerged from a spring known as Élivágar.

In Snorri&#x27;s &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, it is again stated that the Old Norse cosmogony began with a belief in Ginnungagap, the void. From this emerged two realms, the icy, misty Niflheim and the fire-filled Muspell, the latter ruled over by fire-, Surtr. A river produced by these realms coagulated to form Ymir, while a cow known as Audumbla then appeared to provide him with milk. Audumbla licked a block of ice to free Buri, whose son Bor married a named Bestla. Some of the features of this myth, such as the cow Audumbla, are of unclear provenance; Snorri does not specify where he obtained these details as he did for other parts of the myths, and it may be that these were his inventions.

&quot;Völuspá&quot; portrays Yggdrasil as a giant ash tree. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; claims that the deities meet beneath Yggdrasil daily to pass judgement. It also claims that a serpent gnaws at its roots while a deer grazes from its higher branches; a squirrel runs between the two animals, exchanging messages. &quot;Grímnismál&quot; also claims that Yggdrasil has three roots; under one resides the goddess Hel, under another the frost-þursar, and under the third humanity. Snorri also relates that Hel and the frost-þursar live under two of the roots but places the gods, rather than humanity, under the third root.
The term &quot;Yggr&quot; means &quot;the terrifier&quot; and is a synonym for Oðinn, while &quot;drasill&quot; was a poetic word for a horse; &quot;Yggdrasil&quot; thereby means &quot;Oðinn&#x27;s Steed&quot;. This idea of a cosmic tree has parallels with those from various other societies, and may reflect part of a common Indo-European heritage.

The Ragnarok story survives in its fullest exposition in &quot;Völuspá&quot;, although elements can also be seen in earlier poetry. The Ragnarok story suggests that the idea of an inescapable fate pervaded Norse worldviews. There is much evidence that &quot;Völuspá&quot; was influenced by Christian belief, and it is also possible that the theme of conflict being followed by a better future—as reflected in the Ragnarok story—perhaps reflected the period of conflict between paganism and Christianity.

===Afterlife===

Old Nordic religion had several fully developed ideas about death and the afterlife. Snorri refers to multiple realms which welcome the dead; although his descriptions reflect a likely Christian influence, the idea of a plurality of other worlds is likely pre-Christian. Unlike Christianity, Old Norse religion does not appear to have adhered to the belief that moral concerns impacted an individual&#x27;s afterlife destination.

Warriors who died in battle became the Einherjar and were taken to Oðinn&#x27;s hall, Valhalla. There they waited until Ragnarok when they would fight alongside the Æsir. According to the poem &quot;Grímnismál&quot;, Valhalla had 540 doors and a wolf stood outside its western door, while an eagle flew overhead. In that poem, it is also claimed that a boar named Sæhrímnir is eaten every day and that a goat named Heiðrún stands atop the hall&#x27;s roof producing an endless supply of mead. It is unclear how widespread a belief in Valhalla was in Norse society; it may have been a literary creation designed to meet the ruling class&#x27; aspirations since the idea of deceased warriors owing military service to Oðinn parallels the social structure between warriors and their lord. There is no archaeological evidence clearly alluding to a belief in Valhalla.

According to Snorri, while one-half of the slain go to Valhalla, the others go to Frejya&#x27;s hall, Fólkvangr, and those who die from disease or old age go to a realm known as Hel; it was here that Baldr went after his death. The concept of Hel as an afterlife location never appears in pagan-era skaldic poetry, where &quot;Hel&quot; always references the eponymous goddess. Snorri also mentions the possibility of the dead reaching the hall of Brimir in Gimlé, or the hall of Sindri in the Niðafjöll Mountains.

Various sagas and the Eddic poem &quot;Helgakviða Hundingsbana II&quot; refer to the dead residing in their graves, where they remain conscious. In these thirteenth century sources, ghosts (Draugr) are capable of haunting the living. In both &quot;Laxdæla Saga&quot; and &quot;Eyrbyggja Saga&quot;, connections are drawn between pagan burials and hauntings.

In mythological accounts, the deity most closely associated with death is Oðinn. In particular, he is connected with death by hanging; this is apparent in &quot;Hávamál&quot;, a poem found in the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. In stanza 138 of &quot;Hávamál&quot;, Oðinn describes his self-sacrifice, in which he hangs himself on Yggdrasill, the world tree, for nine nights, to attain wisdom and magical powers. In the late &quot;Gautreks Saga&quot;, King Víkarr is hanged and then punctured by a spear; his executioner says &quot;Now I give you to Oðinn&quot;.

==Cultic practice==
Textual accounts suggest a spectrum of rituals, from large public events to more frequent private and family rites, which would have been interwoven with daily life. However, written sources are vague about Norse rituals, and many are invisible to us now even with the assistance of archaeology. Sources mention some rituals addressed to particular deities, but the understanding of the relationship between Old Norse ritual and myth remains speculative.

===Religious rituals===
====Sacrifice====

The primary religious ritual in Norse religion appears to have been sacrifice, or blót. Many texts, both Old Norse and others refer to sacrifices. The &quot;Saga of Hákon the Good&quot; in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; states that there were obligatory blóts, at which animals were slaughtered and their blood, called &quot;hlaut&quot;, sprinkled on the altars and the inside and outside walls of the temple, and ritual toasts were drunk during the ensuing sacrificial feast; the cups were passed over the fire and they and the food were consecrated with a ritual gesture by the chieftain; King Hákon, a Christian, was forced to participate but made the sign of the cross. The description of the temple at Uppsala in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; includes an account of a festival every nine years at which nine males of every kind of animal were sacrificed and the bodies hung in the temple grove. There may have been many methods of sacrifice: several textual accounts refer to the body or head of the slaughtered animal being hung on a pole or tree. In addition to seasonal festivals, an animal blót could take place, for example, before duels, after the conclusion of business between traders, before sailing to ensure favourable winds, and at funerals. Remains of animals from many species have been found in graves from the Old Norse period, and Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s account of a ship burial includes the sacrifice of a dog, draft animals, cows, a rooster and a hen as well as that of a servant girl.

In the Eddic poem &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;, Freyja expresses appreciation for the many sacrifices of oxen made to her by her acolyte, Óttar. In &quot;Hrafnkels saga&quot;, Hrafnkell is called &quot;Freysgoði&quot; for his many sacrifices to Freyr. There may also be markers by which we can distinguish sacrifices to Odin, who was associated with hanging, and some texts particularly associate the ritual killing of a boar with sacrifices to Freyr; but in general, archaeology is unable to identify the deity to whom a sacrifice was made.

The texts frequently allude to human sacrifice. Temple wells in which people were sacrificially drowned are mentioned in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of Uppsala and in Icelandic sagas, where they are called &quot;blótkelda&quot; or &quot;blótgrǫf&quot;, and Adam of Bremen also states that human victims were included among those hanging in the trees at Uppsala. In &quot;Gautreks saga&quot;, people sacrifice themselves during a famine by jumping off cliffs, and both the &quot;Historia Norwegiæ&quot; and &quot;Heimskringla&quot; refer to the willing death of King Dómaldi as a sacrifice after bad harvests. Mentions of people being &quot;sentenced to sacrifice&quot; and of the &quot;wrath of the gods&quot; against criminals suggest a sacral meaning for the death penalty; in &quot;Landnamabók&quot; the method of execution is given as having the back broken on a rock. It is possible that some of the bog bodies recovered from peat bogs in northern Germany and Denmark and dated to the Iron Age were human sacrifices. Such a practice may have been connected to the execution of criminals or of prisoners of war, and Tacitus also states that such type of execution was used as a punishment for &quot;the coward, the unwarlike and the man stained with abominable vices&quot; for the reason that these were considered &quot;infamies that ought to be buried out of sight&quot;; on the other hand, some textual mentions of a person being &quot;offered&quot; to a deity, such as a king offering his son, may refer to a non-sacrificial &quot;dedication&quot;.

Archaeological evidence supports Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s report of funerary human sacrifice: in various cases, the burial of someone who died of natural causes is accompanied by another who died a violent death. For example, at Birka a decapitated young man was placed atop an older man buried with weapons, and at Gerdrup, near Roskilde, a woman was buried alongside a man whose neck had been broken. Many of the details of Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s account are born out by archaeology; and it is possible that those elements which are not visible in the archaeological evidence—such as the sexual encounters—are also accurate.

====Deposition====
Deposition of artefacts in wetlands was a practice in Scandinavia during many periods of prehistory. In the early centuries of the Common Era, huge numbers of destroyed weapons were placed in wetlands: mostly spears and swords, but also shields, tools, and other equipment. Beginning in the 5th century, the nature of the wetland deposits changed; in Scandinavia, fibulae and bracteates were placed in or beside wetlands from the 5th to the mid-6th centuries, and again beginning in the late 8th century, when weapons, as well as jewellery, coins and tools, again began to be deposited, the practice lasting until the early 11th century. This practice extended to non-Scandinavian areas inhabited by Norse people; for example in Britain, a sword, tools, and the bones of cattle, horses and dogs were deposited under a jetty or bridge over the River Hull. The precise purposes of such depositions are unclear.

It is harder to find ritualised deposits on dry land. However, at Lunda (meaning &quot;grove&quot;) near Strängnäs in Södermanland, archaeological evidence has been found at a hill of presumably ritual activity from the 2nd century BCE until the 10th century CE, including deposition of unburnt beads, knives and arrowheads from the 7th to the 9th century. Also during excavations at the church in Frösö, bones of bear, elk, red deer, pigs, cattle, and either sheep or goats were found surrounding a birch tree, having been deposited in the 9th or 10th century; the tree likely had sacrificial associations and perhaps represented Yggdrasill.

====Rites of passage====
A child was accepted into the family via a ritual of sprinkling with water (Old Norse &quot;ausa vatni&quot;) which is mentioned in two Eddic poems, &quot;Rígsþula&quot; and &quot;Hávamál&quot;, and was afterwards given a name. The child was frequently named after a dead relative, since there was a traditional belief in rebirth, particularly in the family.

Old Norse sources also describe rituals for adoption (the Norwegian Gulaþing Law directs the adoptive father, followed by the adoptive child, then all other relatives, to step in turn into a specially made leather shoe) and blood brotherhood (a ritual standing on the bare earth under a specially cut strip of grass, called a &quot;jarðarmen&quot;).

Weddings occur in Icelandic family sagas. The Old Norse word &quot;brúðhlaup&quot; has cognates in many other Germanic languages and means &quot;bride run&quot;; it has been suggested that this indicates a tradition of bride-stealing, but other scholars including Jan de Vries interpreted it as indicating a rite of passage conveying the bride from her birth family to that of her new husband. The bride wore a linen veil or headdress; this is mentioned in the Eddic poem &quot;Rígsþula&quot;. Freyr and Thor are each associated with weddings in some literary sources. In Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of the pagan temple at Uppsala, offerings are said to be made to &quot;Fricco&quot; (presumably Freyr) on the occasion of marriages, and in the Eddic poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, Thor recovers his hammer when it is laid in his disguised lap in a ritual consecration of the marriage. &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; also mentions the goddess Vár as consecrating marriages; Snorri Sturluson states in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; that she hears the vows men and women make to each other, but her name probably means &quot;beloved&quot; rather than being etymologically connected to Old Norse &quot;várar&quot;, &quot;vows&quot;.

Burial of the dead is the Norse rite of passage about which we have most archaeological evidence. There is considerable variation in burial practices, both spatially and chronologically, which suggests a lack of dogma about funerary rites. Both cremations and inhumations are found throughout Scandinavia, but in Viking Age Iceland there were inhumations but, with one possible exception, no cremations. The dead are found buried in pits, wooden coffins or chambers, boats, or stone cists; cremated remains have been found next to the funeral pyre, buried in a pit, in a pot or keg, and scattered across the ground. Most burials have been found in cemeteries, but solitary graves are not unknown. Some grave sites were left unmarked, others memorialised with standing stones or burial mounds.

Grave goods feature in both inhumation and cremation burials. These often consist of animal remains; for instance, in Icelandic pagan graves, the remains of dogs and horses are the most common grave goods. In many cases, the grave goods and other features of the grave reflect social stratification, particularly in the cemeteries at market towns such as Hedeby and Kaupang. In other cases, such as in Iceland, cemeteries show very little evidence of it.

Ship burial is a form of elite inhumation attested both in the archaeological record and in Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s written account. Excavated examples include the Oseberg ship burial near Tønsberg in Norway, another at Klinta on Öland, and the Sutton Hoo ship burial in England. A boat burial at Kaupang in Norway contained a man, woman, and baby lying adjacent to each other alongside the remains of a horse and dismembered dog. The body of a second woman in the stern was adorned with weapons, jewellery, a bronze cauldron, and a metal staff; archaeologists have suggested that she may have been a sorceress. In certain areas of the Nordic world, namely coastal Norway and the Atlantic colonies, smaller boat burials are sufficiently common to indicate it was no longer only an elite custom.

Ship burial is also mentioned twice in the Old Norse literary-mythic corpus. A passage in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Ynglinga Saga&quot; states that Odin—whom he presents as a human king later mistaken for a deity—instituted laws that the dead would be burned on a pyre with their possessions, and burial mounds or memorial stones erected for the most notable men. Also in his &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, the god Baldr is burned on a pyre on his ship, &quot;Hringhorni&quot;, which is launched out to sea with the aid of the Hyrrokkin; Snorri wrote after the Christianisation of Iceland, but drew on Úlfr Uggason&#x27;s skaldic poem &quot;Húsdrápa&quot;.

==Mysticism, magic, animism and shamanism==
The myth preserved in the Eddic poem &quot;Hávamál&quot; of Odin hanging for nine nights on Yggdrasill, sacrificing himself to secure knowledge of the runes and other wisdom in what resembles an initiatory rite, is evidence of mysticism in Old Norse religion.

The gods were associated with two distinct forms of magic. In &quot;Hávamál&quot; and elsewhere, Odin is particularly associated with the runes and with galdr. Charms, often associated with the runes, were a central part of the treatment of disease in both humans and livestock in Old Norse society. In contrast seiðr and the related spæ, which could involve both magic and divination, were practised mostly by women, known as vǫlur and spæ-wives, often in a communal gathering at a client&#x27;s request. 9th- and 10th-century female graves containing iron staffs and grave goods have been identified on this basis as those of seiðr practitioners. Seiðr was associated with the Vanic goddess Freyja; according to a euhemerized account in &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, she taught seiðr to the Æsir, but it involved so much &quot;ergi&quot; (&quot;unmanliness, effeminacy&quot;) that other than Odin himself, its use was reserved for priestesses. There are, however, mentions of male seiðr workers, including elsewhere in &quot;Heimskringla&quot;, where they are condemned for their perversion.

In Old Norse literature, practitioners of seiðr are sometimes described as foreigners, particularly Sami or Finns or in rarer cases from the British Isles. Practitioners such as Þorbjörg Lítilvölva in the &quot;Saga of Erik the Red&quot; appealed to spirit helpers for assistance. Many scholars have pointed to this and other similarities between what is reported of seiðr and spæ ceremonies and shamanism. The historian of religion Dag Strömbäck regarded it as a borrowing from Sami or Balto-Finnic shamanic traditions, but there are also differences from the recorded practices of Sami noaidi. Since the 19th century, some scholars have sought to interpret other aspects of Old Norse religion itself by comparison with shamanism; for example, Odin&#x27;s self-sacrifice on the World Tree has been compared to Finno-Ugric shamanic practices. However, the scholar Jan de Vries regarded seiðr as an indigenous shamanic development among the Norse, and the applicability of shamanism as a framework for interpreting Old Norse practices, even seiðr, is disputed by some scholars.

==Religious sites==
===Outdoor rites===
Religious practices often took place outdoors. For example, at Hove in Trøndelag, Norway, offerings were placed at a row of posts bearing images of gods. Terms particularly associated with outdoor worship are &quot;vé&quot; (shrine) and &quot;hörgr&quot; (cairn or stone altar). Many place names contain these elements in association with the name of a deity, and for example at Lilla Ullevi (compounded with the name of the god Ullr) in Bro parish, Uppland, Sweden, archaeologists have found a stone-covered ritual area at which offerings including silver objects, rings, and a meat fork had been deposited. Place-name evidence suggests that cultic practices might also take place at many different kinds of sites, including fields and meadows (&quot;vangr&quot;, &quot;vin&quot;), rivers, lakes and bogs, groves (&quot;lundr&quot;) and individual trees, and rocks.

Some Icelandic sagas mention sacred places. In both and &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;, members of a family who particularly worshipped Thor are said to have passed after death into the mountain Helgafell (holy mountain), which was not to be defiled by bloodshed or excrement or even to be looked at without washing first. Mountain worship is also mentioned in as an old Norwegian tradition to which Auðr the Deepminded&#x27;s family reverted after she died; the scholar Hilda Ellis Davidson regarded it as associated particularly with the worship of Thor. In &quot;Víga-Glúms saga&quot;, the field Vitazgjafi (certain giver) is associated with Freyr and similarly not to be defiled. The scholar Stefan Brink has argued that one can speak of a &quot;mythical and sacral geography&quot; in pre-Christian Scandinavia.

===Temples===

Several of the sagas refer to cult houses or temples, generally called in Old Norse by the term hof. There are detailed descriptions of large temples, including a separate area with images of gods and the sprinkling of sacrificial blood using twigs like the Christian use of the aspergillum, in &quot;Kjalnesinga saga&quot; and &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;; Snorri&#x27;s description of blót in &quot;Heimskringla&quot; adds more details about the blood sprinkling. Adam of Bremen&#x27;s 11th-century Latin history describes at length a great temple at Uppsala at which human sacrifices regularly took place, and containing statues of Thor, Wotan and Frikko (presumably Freyr); a &quot;scholion&quot; adds the detail that a golden chain hung from the eaves.

These details appear exaggerated and probably indebted to Christian churches, and in the case of Uppsala to the Biblical description of Solomon&#x27;s temple. Based on the dearth of archaeological evidence for dedicated cult houses, particularly under early church buildings in Scandinavia, where they were expected to be found, and additionally on Tacitus&#x27; statement in &quot;Germania&quot; that the Germanic tribes did not confine their deities to buildings, many scholars have believed hofs to be largely a Christian idea of pre-Christian practice. In 1966, based on the results of a comprehensive archaeological survey of most of Scandinavia, the Danish archaeologist Olaf Olsen proposed the model of the &quot;temple farm&quot;: that rather than the hof being a dedicated building, a large longhouse, especially that of the most prominent farmer in the district, served as the location for community cultic celebrations when required.

Since Olsen&#x27;s survey, however, archaeological evidence of temple buildings has come to light in Scandinavia. Although Sune Lindqvist&#x27;s interpretation of post holes which he found under the church at Gamla Uppsala as the remains of an almost square building with a high roof was wishful thinking, excavations nearby in the 1990s uncovered both a settlement and a long building which may have been either a longhouse used seasonally as a cult house or a dedicated hof. The building site at Hofstaðir, near Mývatn in Iceland, which was a particular focus of Olsen&#x27;s work, has since been re-excavated and the layout of the building and further discoveries of the remains of ritually slaughtered animals now suggest that it was a cult house until ritually abandoned. Other buildings that have been interpreted as cult houses have been found at Borg in Östergötland, Lunda in Södermanland, and Uppakra in Scania, Remains of one pagan temple have so far been found under a medieval church, at Mære in Nord-Trøndelag, Norway.

In Norway, the word &quot;hof&quot; appears to have replaced older terms referring to outdoor cult sites during the Viking Age; it has been suggested that the use of cult buildings was introduced into Scandinavia starting in the 3rd century based on the Christian churches then proliferating in the Roman Empire, as part of a range of political and religious changes that Nordic society was then experiencing. Some of the cult houses which have been found are located within what archaeologists call &quot;central places&quot;: settlements with various religious, political, judicial, and mercantile functions. A number of these central places have place-names with cultic associations, such as Gudme (home of gods), Vä (&quot;vé&quot;), and Helgö (holy island). Some archaeologists have argued that they were designed to mirror Old Norse cosmology, thus connecting ritual practices with wider worldviews.

==Priests and kings==
There is no evidence of a professional priesthood among the Norse, and rather cultic activities were carried out by members of the community who also had other social functions and positions. In Old Norse society, religious authority was harnessed to secular authority; there was no separation between economic, political, and symbolic institutions. Both the Norwegian kings&#x27; sagas and Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account claim that kings and chieftains played a prominent role in cultic sacrifices. In medieval Iceland, the goði was a social role that combined religious, political, and judicial functions, responsible for serving as a chieftain in the district, negotiating legal disputes, and maintaining order among his þingmenn. Most evidence suggests that public cultic activity was largely the preserve of high-status males in Old Norse society. However, there are exceptions. The refers to two women holding the position of &quot;gyðja&quot;, both of whom were members of local chiefly families. In Ibn Fadlan&#x27;s account of the Rus, he describes an elder woman known as the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; who oversaw a funerary ritual.

Among scholars, there has been much debate as to whether sacral kingship was practised among Old Norse communities, in which the monarch was endowed with a divine status and thus responsible for ensuring that a community&#x27;s needs were met through supernatural means. Evidence for this has been cited from the &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; poem in which the Swedes kill their king, Domalde, following a famine. However, interpretations of this event other than sacral kingship are possible; for instance, Domalde may have been killed in a political coup.

==Iconography and imagery==

The most widespread religious symbol in the Viking Age Old Norse religion was Mjölnir, the hammer of Thor. This symbol first appears in the ninth century and might be a conscious response to the symbolism of the Christian cross. Although found across the Viking world, Mjölnir pendants are most commonly found in graves from modern Denmark, south-eastern Sweden, and southern Norway; their wide distribution suggests the particular popularity of Thor. When found in inhumation graves, Mjölnir pendants are more likely to be found in women&#x27;s graves than men&#x27;s. Earlier examples were made from iron, bronze, or amber, although silver pendants became fashionable in the tenth century. This may have been a response to the growing popularity of Christian cross amulets.

The two religious symbols may have co-existed closely; one piece of archaeological evidence suggesting that this is the case is a soapstone mould for casting pendants discovered from Trengården in Denmark. This mould had space for a Mjölnir and a crucifix pendant side by side, suggesting that the artisan who produced these pendants catered for both religious communities. These have typically been interpreted as a protective symbol, although may also have had associations with fertility, being worn as amulets, good-luck charms, or sources of protection. However, around 10 per cent of those discovered during excavation had been placed on top of cremation urns, suggesting that they had a place in certain funerary rituals.

Gods and goddesses were depicted through figurines, pendants, fibulas, and as images on weapons. Thor is usually recognised in depictions by his carrying of Mjölnir. Iconographic material suggesting other deities are less common than those connected to Thor. Some pictorial evidence, most notably that of the picture stones, intersects with the mythologies recorded in later texts. These picture stones, produced in mainland Scandinavia during the Viking Age, are the earliest known visual depictions of Norse mythological scenes. It is nevertheless unclear what function these picture-stones had or what they meant to the communities who produced them.

Oðinn has been identified on various gold bracteates produced from the fifth and sixth centuries.
Some figurines have been interpreted as depictions of deities. The Lindby image from Skåne, Sweden is often interpreted as Oðinn because of its missing eye; the bronze figurine from Eyrarland in Iceland as Thor because it holds a hammer. A bronze figurine from Rällinge in Södermanland has been attributed to Freyr because it has a big phallus, and a silver pendant from Aska in Östergötland has been seen as Freya because it wears a necklace that could be Brisingamen.

Another image that recurs in Norse artwork from this period is the valknut (the term is modern, not Old Norse). These symbols may have a specific association with Oðinn, because they often accompany images of warriors on picture stones.

==Influence==
===Romanticism, aesthetics, and politics===
During the romanticist movement of the 19th century, various northern Europeans took an increasing interest in Old Norse religion, seeing in it ancient pre-Christian mythology that provided an alternative to the dominant Classical mythology. As a result, artists featured Norse gods and goddesses in their paintings and sculptures, and their names were applied to streets, squares, journals, and companies throughout parts of northern Europe.

The mythological stories derived from Old Norse and other Germanic sources inspired various artists, including Richard Wagner, who used these narratives as the basis for his &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot;. Also inspired by these Old Norse and Germanic tales was J. R. R. Tolkien, who used them in creating his legendarium, the fictional universe in which he set novels like &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. During the 1930s and 1940s, elements of Old Norse and other Germanic religions were adopted by Nazi Germany. Since the fall of the Nazis, various right-wing groups continue to use elements of Old Norse and Germanic religion in their symbols, names, and references; some Neo-Nazi groups, for instance, use Mjölnir as a symbol.

Theories about a shamanic component of Old Norse religion have been adopted by forms of Nordic neoshamanism; groups practising what they called &quot;seiðr&quot; was established in Europe and the United States by the 1990s.

===Scholarly study===
Research into Old Norse religion has been interdisciplinary, involving historians, archaeologists, philologists, place-name scholars, literary scholars, and historians of religion. Scholars from different disciplines have tended to take different approaches to the material; for instance, many literary scholars have been highly sceptical about how accurately Old Norse text portrays pre-Christian religion, whereas historians of religion have tended to regard these portrayals as highly accurate.

Interest in Norse mythology was revived in the eighteenth century, and scholars turned their attention to it in the early 19th century. Since this research appeared from the background of European romanticism, many of the scholars operating in the 19th and 20th centuries framed their approach through nationalism, and were strongly influenced by their interpretations by romantic notions about nationhood, conquest, and religion. Their understanding of cultural interaction was also coloured by 19th-century European colonialism and imperialism. Many regarded pre-Christian religion as singular and unchanging, directly equated religion with the nation, and projected modern national borders onto the Viking Age past.

Due to the use of Old Norse and Germanic iconography by the Nazis, academic research into Old Norse religion reduced heavily following the Second World War. Scholarly interest in the subject then revived in the late 20th century. By the 21st century, Old Norse religion was regarded as one of the best known non-Christian religions from Europe, alongside that of Greece and Rome.

<text>Abu Ghraib prison (, &quot;Sijn Abū Ghurayb&quot;) was a prison complex in Abu Ghraib, Iraq, located west of Baghdad. Abu Ghraib prison was opened in the 1960s and served as a maximum-security prison. From the 1970s, the prison was used by Saddam Hussein to hold political prisoners and later the United States to hold Iraqi prisoners. It developed a reputation for torture and extrajudicial killing, and was closed in 2014.

Abu Ghraib gained international attention in 2003 following the U.S. invasion of Iraq, when the torture and abuse of detainees committed by guards in part of the complex operated by Coalition forces was exposed.

In 2006, the United States transferred complete control of Abu Ghraib to the federal government of Iraq, and was reopened in 2009 as Baghdad Central Prison (Arabic: سجن بغداد المركزي &quot;Sijn Baġdād al-Markizī&quot;). However, due to security concerns during the War in Iraq, it closed in 2014. Since all of the 2,400 inmates were transferred to other high-security prisons, the prison complex is currently vacant, and Saddam-era mass graves have been uncovered at the site.

== History ==
The prison was built by Western contractors in the 1960s. The prison held as many as 15,000 inmates in 2001. In 2002, Saddam Hussein&#x27;s government began an expansion project to add six new cellblocks to the prison. In October 2002, he gave amnesty to most prisoners in Iraq. After the prisoners were released and the prison was left empty, it was vandalized and looted. Almost all of the documents relating to prisoners were piled and burnt inside of prison offices and cells, leading to extensive structural damage.

Known mass-graves related to Abu Ghraib include:
* Khan Dhari, west of Baghdad - mass grave with the bodies of political prisoners from Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. Fifteen victims were executed on 26 December 1998 and buried by prison authorities under the cover of darkness.
* Al-Zahedi, on the western outskirts of Baghdad - secret graves near a civilian cemetery contain the remains of nearly 1,000 political prisoners. According to an eyewitness, 10 to 15 bodies arrived at a time from the Abu Ghraib prison and were buried by local civilians. An execution on 10 December 1999 in Abu Ghraib claimed the lives of 101 people in one day. On 9 March 2000, 58 prisoners were killed at a time. The last corpse interred was number 993.

=== 2003–2006 ===

From 2003 until August 2006, Abu Ghraib prison was used for detention purposes by both the U.S.-led coalition forces and the Iraqi government. The Iraqi government has controlled the area of the facility known as &quot;The Hard Site&quot;. The prison was used to house only convicted criminals. Suspected criminals, insurgents or those arrested and awaiting trial were held at other facilities, commonly known as &quot;camps&quot; in U.S. military parlance. The U.S. housed all its detainees at &quot;Camp Redemption&quot;, which is divided into five security levels. This camp built in the summer of 2004 replaced the three-level setup of Camp Ganci, Camp Vigilant and Abu Ghraib&#x27;s Tier 1. The remainder of the facility was occupied by the U.S. military.

Abu Ghraib served as both a FOB (Forward Operating Base) and a detention facility. When the U.S. military was using the Abu Ghraib prison as a detention facility, it housed approximately 7,490 prisoners there in March 2004. Later population of detainees was much smaller, because Camp Redemption had a much smaller capacity than Camp Ganci had, and many detainees have been sent from Abu Ghraib to Camp Bucca for this reason. The U.S. military initially held all &quot;persons of interest&quot; in Camp Redemption. Some were suspected rebels, and some suspected criminals. Those convicted by trial in Iraqi court are transferred to the Iraqi-run Hard Site.

In the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal, reserve soldiers from the 372nd Military Police Company were charged under the Uniform Code of Military Justice with prisoner abuse, beginning with an Army Criminal Investigation Division investigation on January 14, 2004. In April 2004, U.S. television news-magazine &quot;60 Minutes&quot; reported on a story from the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which recounted torture and humiliation of Iraqi detainees by U.S. soldiers and contracted civilians. The story included photographs depicting the abuse of prisoners. The events created a substantial political scandal within the U.S. and other coalition countries.

On April 20, 2004, insurgents fired 40 mortar rounds into the prison, killing 24 detainees and injuring 92. Commentators thought the attack was either an attempt to incite a riot or retribution for detainees&#x27; cooperating with the United States. In May 2004, the U.S.-led coalition embarked on a prisoner-release policy to reduce numbers to fewer than 2,000. The U.S. military released nearly 1,000 detainees at the prison during the week ending August 27, 2005, at the request of the Iraqi government. In a May 24, 2004 address at the U.S. Army War College, President George W. Bush announced that the prison would be demolished. On June 14 Iraqi interim President Ghazi Mashal Ajil al-Yawer said he opposed this decision; on June 21 U.S. military judge Col. James Pohl ruled the prison was a crime scene and could not be demolished until investigations and trials were completed.

On April 2, 2005, the prison was attacked by more than 60 insurgents in the engagement known as the Battle of Abu Ghraib. In the two hours before being forced to retreat, the attackers suffered at least 50 casualties according to the U.S. military. Thirty-six persons at or in the prison, including U.S. military personnel, civilians and detainees, were injured in the attack. The attackers used small arms, rockets, and RPGs as weapons, and threw grenades over the walls. A suicide VBIED detonated just outside the front wall after Marines fired on it. Officials believe that the car bomb was intended to breach the prison wall, enabling an assault and/or mass escape for detainees. Insurgents also attacked military forces nearby on highways en route to the prison for reinforcement and used ambushes along the roads. Al Qaeda in Iraq claimed responsibility.

=== 2006–2014 ===
In March 2006, the U.S. military decided to transfer the 4,500 inmates to other prisons and transfer control of the Abu Ghraib prison to Iraqi authorities. The prison was reported emptied of prisoners in August 2006. The formal transfer was made on September 2, 2006. The formal transfer was conducted between Major General Jack Gardner, Commander of Task Force 134, and representatives of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice and the Iraqi Army.

In February 2009, Iraq reopened Abu Ghraib under the new name of Baghdad Central Prison. It was designed to house 3,500 inmates. The government said it planned to increase the number up to 15,000 prisoners by the end of the year.

A major prison break occurred on July 21, 2013 when least 500 prisoners escaped. A senior member of the security and defense committee in parliament described the prisoners as mostly those who were &quot;convicted senior members of al-Qaeda and had received death sentences.&quot; A simultaneous attack occurred at another prison, in Taji, around 12 miles north of Baghdad, where 16 members of the Iraqi security forces and six militants were killed. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) issued a statement on a jihadist forum claiming that they were responsible for organising and executing the prison break, which had taken months of preparation, and claimed that the attacks involved 12 car bombs, suicide bombers and a barrage of mortars and rockets. They also claimed that they killed more than 120 government troops, though the Iraqi authorities claimed that 25 members of the security forces were killed, along with 21 prisoners and at least 10 militants.

=== Closure ===

On April 15, 2014, the Iraqi Justice Ministry announced that it had closed the prison amid fear that it could be taken over by ISIL, which controlled much of Anbar Province at the time. All 2,400 inmates were moved to other high-security facilities in the country. It was not made clear if the closure was temporary or permanent.

<text>Tragopan is a bird genus in the pheasant family Phasianidae. Member of the genus are commonly called &quot;horned pheasants&quot; because males have two brightly colored, fleshy horns on their head that can be erected during courtship displays. The habit of tragopans to nest in trees is unique among phasianids.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Tragopan&quot; was introduced by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in 1829 for the satyr tragopan. The name &quot;tragopan&quot; is a mythical horned purple-headed bird mentioned by the Roman authors Pliny and Pomponius Mela.

The genus contains five species.

<doc id="627189" wikidata="Q1210069" url="?curid=627189" title="General manager">
<text>A general manager (GM) is an executive who has overall responsibility for managing both the revenue and cost elements of a company&#x27;s income statement, known as profit &amp; loss (P&amp;L) responsibility. A general manager usually oversees most or all of the firm&#x27;s marketing and sales functions as well as the day-to-day operations of the business. Frequently, the general manager is responsible for effective planning, delegating, coordinating, staffing, organizing, and decision making to attain desirable profit making results for an organization.

In many cases, the general manager of a business is given a different formal title or titles. Most corporate managers holding the titles of chief executive officer (CEO) or president, for example, are the general managers of their respective businesses. More rarely, the chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), or chief marketing officer (CMO) will act as the general manager of the business. Depending on the company, individuals with the title managing director, regional vice president, country manager, product manager, branch manager, or segment manager may also have general management responsibilities. In large companies, many vice presidents will have the title of general manager when they have the full set of responsibility for the function in that particular area of the business and are often titled vice president and general manager.

In consumer products companies, general managers are often given the title brand manager or category manager. In professional services firms, the general manager may hold titles such as managing partner, senior partner, or managing director.

==Industry-specific usages==

===Hotels===

In the hotel industry, the general manager is the head executive responsible for the overall operation of an individual hotel establishment including financial profitability. The general manager holds ultimate managerial authority over the hotel operation and usually reports directly to a regional vice president, corporate office, and/or hotel ownership/investors.

Some of the common duties of a general manager include are hiring and the management of an executive team, which consists of individual department heads, who oversee various hotel departments and functions, budgeting and financial management; creating and enforcing hotel business objectives and goals; sales management; marketing management; revenue management; project management; contract management; handling of emergencies and other major issues involving guests, employees, or the facility; public relations; labor relations; local government relations; and maintaining business partnerships.

The extent of duties of an individual hotel general manager vary significantly depending on the size of the hotel and company organization; for example, general managers of smaller boutique-type hotels may be directly responsible for additional administrative duties such as accounting, human resources, payroll, purchasing, and other duties that would normally be handled by other subordinate managers or entire departments and divisions in a larger hotel operation.

===Sports teams===

In most professional sports, the general manager is the team executive responsible for acquiring the rights to player personnel, negotiating their contracts, and reassigning or dismissing players no longer desired on the team. The general manager may also have responsibility for hiring and firing the head coach of the team.

For many years in U.S. professional sports, coaches often served as general managers for their teams as well, deciding which players would be kept on the team and which ones dismissed, and even negotiating the terms of their contracts in cooperation with the ownership of the team. In fact, many sports teams in the early years of U.S. professional sports were coached by the owner of the team, so in some cases the same individual served as owner, general manager and head coach.

As the amount of money involved in professional sports increased, many prominent players began to hire agents to negotiate contracts on their behalf. This intensified contract negotiations to ensure that player contracts are in accordance with salary caps, as well as being consistent with the desires of the team&#x27;s ownership and its ability to pay.

General Managers are usually responsible for the selection of players in player drafts and work with the coaching staff and scouts to build a strong team. In sports with developmental or minor leagues, the general manager is usually the team executive with the overall responsibility for &quot;sending down&quot; and &quot;calling up&quot; players to and from these leagues, although the head coach may also have significant input into these decisions.

Some of the most successful sports general managers have been former players and coaches, while others have backgrounds in ownership and business management.

The term is not commonly used in Europe, especially in football, where the position of manager or coach is used instead to refer to the managing/coaching position. The position of director of football might be the most similar position on many European football clubs.

<text>José Juventino Policarpo Rosas Cadenas (25 January 18689 July 1894) was a Mexican composer and violinist, known worldwide for the waltz &quot;Sobre las olas&quot; (&quot;Over the Waves&quot;).

==Life and career==

Rosas was born in Santa Cruz, Guanajuato, later renamed Santa Cruz de Galeana, Guanajuato, and still later into Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas. Rosas began his musical career as a street musician, playing with dance music bands in Mexico City. In 1884-85 and 1888 he enrolled into the conservatory, both times leaving it without taking any examination.

Most of Rosas&#x27;s compositions—among them &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; (&quot;Over the Waves&quot;)—were issued by Wagner y Levien and Nagel Sucesores in Mexico City.

In the late 1880s, Rosas is reported to have been a member of a military band, and in 1891 he worked in Michoacán. In 1892–93 Rosas lived near Monterrey before joining an orchestra in 1893 for a tour through the USA. During this tour, the group performed at the World Columbian Exposition World&#x27;s Fair in Chicago, Illinois.

In 1894, Rosas went for a several-month tour to Cuba with an Italian-Mexican ensemble, where he came down with major health problems, having to stay behind in Surgidero de Batabanó. As a result of spinal myelitis, he died there at the age of 26. Fifteen years later, in 1909, his remains were brought back to Mexico.

Rosas is one of the best known Mexican composers of salon music, as well as the one with the highest number of editions abroad and of sound recordings, the first of them released in 1898.
Rosas&#x27;s best known work is &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; or &quot;Over the Waves&quot;. It was first published in Mexico in 1888. It remains popular as a classic waltz, and has also found its way into New Orleans Jazz, Bluegrass Music, Country and Western music and Tejano music. In the United States &quot;Sobre las Olas&quot; has a cultural association with funfairs, ice skating, circuses and trapeze artists, as it was one of the tunes available for Wurlitzer&#x27;s popular line of fairground organs. The music was used for the tune &quot;The Loveliest Night of the Year&quot;, which was sung by Ann Blyth in MGM&#x27;s film &quot;The Great Caruso&quot;. It remains still popular with country and old-time fiddlers in the United States.

The 1950 film &quot;Over the Waves&quot; was based on his life.

<text>Dorothy Jacqueline Keely (March 9, 1928 – December 16, 2017), professionally known as Keely Smith, was an American jazz and popular music singer, who performed and recorded extensively in the 1950s with then-husband Louis Prima, and throughout the 1960s as a solo artist.

Smith married Prima in 1953. The couple were stars throughout the entertainment business, including stage, television, motion pictures, hit records, and cabaret acts. They won a Grammy in 1959, its inaugural year, for their smash hit, &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, which remained on the charts for 18 weeks.

== Early years ==
Smith was born in Norfolk, Virginia; her ancestry was Irish and Cherokee. Jesse Smith, her stepfather, was a carpenter, and her mother took in laundry to earn money to buy gowns for Smith to wear when she performed.

==Career==
When Smith was 11 years old, she sang regularly as a cast member of &quot;The Joe Brown Radio Gang&quot; program on a Norfolk station. At age 14, Smith sang with a naval air station band led by Saxie Dowell. At 15, she got her first paying job with the Earl Bennett band. She saw Louis Prima perform in New York City in 1949. They recorded together in 1949 and married on July 13, 1953.

Their songs included Johnny Mercer&#x27;s and Harold Arlen&#x27;s &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;, which was a Top 20 hit in the US in 1958. At the 1st Annual Grammy Awards in 1959, Smith and Prima won the first Grammy for Best Performance by a Vocal Group or Chorus for &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;. Her deadpan act was popular with fans. The duo followed up with the minor successes &quot;I&#x27;ve Got You Under My Skin&quot; and &quot;Bei Mir Bist Du Schoen&quot;, a cover of the 1937 Andrews Sisters hit.

Smith and Prima&#x27;s act was a mainstay of the Las Vegas lounge scene for much of the 1950s. Though her actual voice was not used, she was caricatured as &quot;Squealy Smith&quot; in Bob Clampett&#x27;s 1960 &quot;Beany and Cecil&quot; episode &quot;So What and the Seven Whatnots&quot;, a Snow White spoof in a Vegas setting.

Smith appeared with Prima in the movie &quot;Hey Boy! Hey Girl!&quot;, singing &quot;Fever&quot;, and also appeared in and sang on the soundtrack of the previous year&#x27;s film &quot;Thunder Road&quot;. Her song in &quot;Thunder Road&quot; was &quot;Whippoorwill&quot;. She also appeared in the film &quot;Senior Prom.&quot;

Her first big solo hit was &quot;I Wish You Love&quot; in 1957, and it brought her a Grammy award nomination for Best Vocal Performance, Female. Her debut album by that same title achieved gold status In 1961, Smith divorced Prima. She then signed with Reprise Records, where her musical director was Nelson Riddle. 

In 1965, she had Top 20 hits in the United Kingdom with an album of Beatles compositions, &quot;Keely Smith Sings The John Lennon—Paul McCartney Songbook&quot;, and a single, &quot;You&#x27;re Breaking My Heart&quot;, which reached No. 14 in April.

She returned to singing in 1985, recording the album &quot;I&#x27;m in Love Again&quot; with Bud Shank, Bill Perkins and Bob Cooper. Her albums, &quot;Swing, Swing, Swing&quot; (2000), &quot;Keely Sings Sinatra&quot; (2001) for which she received a Grammy nomination, and &quot;Keely Swings Basie-Style With Strings&quot; (2002) won critical and popular acclaim. In 2008, she performed a duet with Kid Rock during the 50th Grammy Awards on &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot;.

Smith earned positive reviews for her performances at Feinstein&#x27;s nightclub in Manhattan in 2005. Said &quot;Variety&quot;: &quot;Smith&#x27;s bold, dark voice took firm hold on a handful of great standard tunes, and she swung hard&quot;, and &quot;The New Yorker&quot; review called her &quot;both legendary and underrated ... She can still sing the stuffing out of a ballad as well as swing any tune into the stratosphere.&quot;

According to a news release from her publicist issued upon her death, Smith was &quot;very resolute in being in control of the trajectory of her career&quot;. 
&quot;Nobody will ever interfere with what I do on stage&quot;, Smith once told &quot;Theatermania&quot;. &quot;Someone might have an opinion of something but, if I disagree with it, I&#x27;ll go with my own thinking. I&#x27;m just a plain person. I sing like I talk — and, when I&#x27;m on stage, I talk just like I&#x27;m talking to you.&quot;

Smith&#x27;s final performance was on February 13, 2011, at the Cerritos Performing Arts Center in Southern California.

==Personal life==
Smith first married Matteo Gambardella Jr. on September 6, 1947 in Pasquotank County, North Carolina, before divorcing him in December 1950. Smith married Louis Prima July 13, 1953. in Virginia Beach. They had two children, Toni Elizabeth and Luanne Francis. Smith had affairs with Sam Giancana and Frank Sinatra prior to her divorce from Prima in 1961. She also had a relationship with Clint Eastwood. She married Jimmy Bowen in 1965. The couple divorced in 1969. In 1975, Smith married singer Bobby Milano (real name Charles Caci) in Palm Springs. Sinatra gave the bride away. Milano died in 2006. 

On December 16, 2017, Smith died of apparent heart failure in Palm Springs, California, at the age of 89. She is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills.

==Legacy==
In 1998, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to her. She also has a star at 7080 Hollywood Boulevard in the Recording section of the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It was dedicated on September 22, 1998.

<text>Transhuman Space (THS) is a role-playing game by David Pulver, published by Steve Jackson Games as part of the &quot;Powered by &quot;GURPS&quot;&quot; (&quot;Generic Universal Role-Playing System&quot;) line. Set in the year 2100, humanity has begun to colonize the Solar System. The pursuit of transhumanism is now in full swing, as more and more people reach fully posthuman states.

&quot;Transhuman Space&quot; was one of the first role-playing games to tackle postcyberpunk and transhumanist themes. In 2002, the &quot;Transhuman Space&quot; adventure &quot;Orbital Decay&quot; received an Origins Award nomination for Best Role-Playing Game Adventure. &quot;Transhuman Space&quot; won the 2003 Grog d&#x27;Or Award for &quot;Best Role-playing Game, Game Line or RPG Setting&quot;.

==Setting==
The game assumes that no cataclysm — natural or human-induced — swept Earth in the 21st century. Instead, constant developments in information technology, genetic engineering, nanotechnology and nuclear physics generally improved condition of the average human life. Plagues of the 20th century (like cancer or AIDS) have been suppressed, the ozone layer is being restored and Earth&#x27;s ecosystems are recovering (although thermal emission by fusion power plants poses an environmental threat—albeit a much lesser one than previous sources of energy). Thanks to modern medicine humans live biblical timespans surrounded by various artificially intelligent helper applications and robots (cybershells), sensory experience broadcasts (future TV) and cyberspace telepresence. Thanks to cheap and clean fusion energy humanity has power to fuel all these wonders, restore and transform its home planet and finally settle on other heavenly bodies.

Human genetic engineering has advanced to the point that anyone—single individuals, same-sex couples, groups of three or more—can reproduce. The embryos can be allowed to be developed naturally, or they can undergo three levels of tinkering: 
1. &quot;Genefixing&quot;, which corrects defects; 
2. &quot;Upgrades&quot;, which boost natural abilities (Ishtar Upgrades are slightly more attractive than usual, Metanoia Upgrades are more intelligent, etc.); and... 
3. Full transition to &quot;parahuman&quot; status (Nyx Parahumans only need a few hours of sleep per week, Aquamorphs can live underwater, etc.) Another type of human genetic engineering, far more controversial, is the creation of bioroids, fully sentient slave races.

People can &quot;upload&quot; by recording the simulation of their brains on computer disks. The emulated individual then becomes a &quot;ghost&quot;, an infomorph very easily confused with &quot;sapient artificial intelligence&quot;. However, this technology has several problems as the solely available &quot;brainpeeling&quot; technique is fatal to the original biological lifeform being simulated, has a significant failure rate and the philosophical questions regarding personal identity remain equivocal. Any infomorph, regardless of its origin, can be plugged into a &quot;cybershell&quot; (robotic or cybernetic body), or a biological body, or &quot;bioshell&quot;. Or, the individual can illegally make multiple &quot;xoxes&quot;, or copies of themselves, and scatter them throughout the system, exponentially increasing the odds that at least one of them will live for centuries more, if not forever.

This is also a time of space colonization. First, humanity (specifically China, followed by the United States and others) colonized Mars in a fashion resembling that outlined in the Mars Direct project. The Moon, Lagrangian points, inner planets and asteroids soon followed. In the late 21st century even some of Saturn&#x27;s moons have been settled as a base for that planet&#x27;s Helium-3 scooping operations.
Transhuman Space&#x27;s setting is neither utopia nor dystopia, however: several problems have arisen from these otherwise beneficial developments. The generation gap has become a chasm as lifespans increase. No longer do the elite fear death, and no longer can the young hope to replace them. While it seemed that outworld colonies would offer accommodation and work for those young ones, they are being replaced by genetically tailored bioroids and AI-powered cybershells. The concept of &quot;humanity&quot; is no longer clear in a world where even some animals speak of their rights and the dead haunt both cyberspace and reality (in form of infomorph-controlled bioshells or cybershells).

And the wonders of high science are not universally shared — some countries merely struggle with informatization while others suffer from nanoplagues, defective drugs, implants and software tested on their populace. In some poor countries high-tech tyrants oppress their backward people. And in outer space all sort of modern crime thrives, barely suppressed by military forces.

==Publication history==
After the initial set of &quot;GURPS&quot; books that were published using the &quot;GURPS Lite&quot;, later publications such as &quot;Transhuman Space&quot; by David Pulver were labelled simply &quot;Powered by &quot;GURPS&quot; without using the name &quot;GURPS&quot;&quot; in the book title. &quot;Transhuman Space&quot; received a significant amount of supporting publications, and was the largest original background setting that Steve Jackson Games produced in 15 years. Shannon Appelcline noted that by its inclusion of posthuman characters, the book began to show the limits of the &quot;GURPS&quot; system as it was, which is something that Pulver would address soon thereafter.

Steve Jackson Games has not updated the core book (&quot;GURPS Transhuman Space&quot;) to 4th edition, although the supplement &quot;Transhuman Space: Changing Times&quot; provides a path for migrating to 4th edition. It has produced several 4th edition supplements for the setting: Transhuman Space: Bioroid Bazaar, Transhuman Space: Cities on the Edge, Transhuman Space: Martial Arts 2100, Transhuman Space: Personnel Files 2-5, Transhuman Space: Shell-Tech, GURPS Spaceships 8: Transhuman Spacecraft, Transhuman Space: Transhuman Mysteries, and Transhuman Space: Wings of the Rising Sun.

==Reception==
In a review of &quot;Transhuman Space&quot; in &quot;Black Gate&quot;, William Stoddard said &quot;&quot;Transhuman Space&quot; was a richly detailed setting; if it had imperfections, it had enough depth to make up for them. I think it has the potential to become a classic in its field. Perhaps a campaign set in its default start year of 2100 could leave the early twenty-first century blurry enough to avoid obvious incongruities.&quot;

<doc id="627211" wikidata="Q2517440" url="?curid=627211" title="Splatterpunk">
<text>Splatterpunk is a movement within horror fiction originating in the 1980s, distinguished by its graphic, often gory, depiction of violence, countercultural alignment and &quot;hyperintensive horror with no limits.&quot; The term was coined in 1986 by David J. Schow at the Twelfth World Fantasy Convention in Providence, Rhode Island. Splatterpunk is regarded as a revolt against the &quot;traditional, meekly suggestive horror story&quot;. Splatterpunk has been defined as a &quot;literary genre characterised by graphically described scenes of an extremely gory nature.&quot;

==History==
Michael Shea&#x27;s short story &quot;The Autopsy&quot; (1980) has been described as a &quot;proto-splatterpunk&quot; story.

Splatterpunk provoked considerable controversy among horror writers. Robert Bloch criticized the movement, arguing &quot;there is a distinction to be made between that which inspires terror and that which inspires nausea&quot;. William F. Nolan and Charles L. Grant also censured the movement. However, critics R. S. Hadji and Philip Nutman praised the movement, the latter describing splatterpunk as a &quot;survivalist&quot; literature that &quot;reflects the moral chaos of our times&quot;.

Though the term gained some prominence in the 1980s and 1990s, and, as a movement, attracted a cult following, the term &quot;splatterpunk&quot; has since been replaced by other synonymous terms for the genre. The last major commercial endeavor aimed at the splatterpunk audience was 1995&#x27;s &quot;Splatterpunks II: Over the Edge&quot;, an anthology of short stories which also included essays on horror cinema and an interview with Anton LaVey. By 1998, one commentator suggested interest in splatterpunk was declining, saying it &quot;seemed to have reached a peak&quot; in the mid-1990s. The term is still sometimes used for horror with a strong gruesome element, such as Philip Nutman&#x27;s novel &quot;Cities of Night&quot;.

In 2018, the organizers of KillerCon established the Splatterpunk Awards (or &quot;Bernies&quot;) to honor achievement in the fields of splatterpunk and extreme horror. An author who won a Splatterpunk Medal for his novel, &quot;Full Brutal&quot;, was Kristopher Triana.

Though traditionally associated with literature, splatterpunk has also gained influence in other media, namely video games. &quot;The Coffin of Andy and Leyley&quot;, a 2023 indie horror game, gained notoriety from this expansion. Initially banned in Australia due to its controversial themes, the game was later reinstated with an R-18+ rating due to primarily splatterpunk characteristics such as gore and high impact violence. The game is not the first in the splatterpunk genre within gaming, but is one of the more notable.

==Genre writers==
Writers known for writing in this genre include Clive Barker, Poppy Z. Brite, Jack Ketchum, Richard Laymon, J. F. Gonzalez, Joe Lansdale, Brian Keene, Richard Christian Matheson, Robert R. McCammon, Shane McKenzie, Wrath James White, David J. Schow (described as &quot;the father of splatterpunk&quot; by Richard Christian Matheson), John Skipp, Craig Spector, Edward Lee, Ray Garton, Dan Shrader, and Michael Boatman. Some commentators also regard Kathe Koja as a splatterpunk writer.

<text>The hindgut (or epigaster) is the posterior (caudal) part of the alimentary canal. In mammals, it includes the distal one third of the transverse colon and the splenic flexure, the descending colon, sigmoid colon and up to the ano-rectal junction. In zoology, the term &quot;hindgut&quot; refers also to the cecum and ascending colon.

==Structure==
===Blood supply===
Arterial supply is by the inferior mesenteric artery, and venous drainage is to the portal venous system. Lymphatic drainage is to the chyle cistern.

===Nerve supply===
The hindgut is innervated via the inferior mesenteric plexus. Sympathetic innervation is from the lumbar splanchnic nerves (L1-L2), parasympathetic innervation is from S2-S4.

<text>The history of alternative medicine covers the history of a group of diverse medical practices that were collectively promoted as &quot;alternative medicine&quot; beginning in the 1970s, to the collection of individual histories of members of that group, or to the history of western medical practices that were labeled &quot;irregular practices&quot; by the western medical establishment. It includes the histories of complementary medicine and of integrative medicine. &quot;Alternative medicine&quot; is a loosely defined and very diverse set of products, practices, and theories that are perceived by its users to have the healing effects of medicine, but do not originate from evidence gathered using the scientific method, are not part of biomedicine, or are contradicted by scientific evidence or established science. &quot;Biomedicine&quot; is that part of medical science that applies principles of anatomy, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and other natural sciences to clinical practice, using scientific methods to establish the effectiveness of that practice.

Much of what is now categorized as alternative medicine was developed as independent, complete medical systems, was developed long before biomedicine and use of scientific methods, and was developed in relatively isolated regions of the world where there was little or no medical contact with pre-scientific western medicine, or with each other&#x27;s systems. Examples are traditional Chinese medicine, European humoral theory and the Ayurvedic medicine of India. Other alternative medicine practices, such as homeopathy, were developed in western Europe and in opposition to western medicine, at a time when western medicine was based on unscientific theories that were dogmatically imposed by western religious authorities. Homeopathy was developed prior to discovery of the basic principles of chemistry, which proved homeopathic remedies contained nothing but water. But homeopathy, with its remedies made of water, was harmless compared to the unscientific and dangerous orthodox western medicine practiced at that time, which included use of toxins and draining of blood, often resulting in permanent disfigurement or death. Other alternative practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, were developed in the United States at a time that western medicine was beginning to incorporate scientific methods and theories, but the biomedical model was not yet fully established. Practices such as chiropractic and osteopathy, each considered to be irregular by the medical establishment, also opposed each other, both rhetorically and politically with licensing legislation. Osteopathic practitioners added the courses and training of biomedicine to their licensing, and licensed Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine holders began diminishing use of the unscientific origins of the field, and without the original practices and theories, osteopathic medicine in the United States is now considered the same as biomedicine.

Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to &quot;irregular practitioners&quot;, and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific or quackery. Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, with the group promoted as being &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. Following the counterculture movement of the 1960s, misleading marketing campaigns promoting &quot;alternative medicine&quot; as being an effective &quot;alternative&quot; to biomedicine, and with changing social attitudes about not using chemicals, challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to values and beliefs of other cultures and their practices through cultural relativism, adding postmodernism and deconstructivism to ways of thinking about science and its deficiencies, and with growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of evidence-based medicine, use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise, then had explosive growth beginning in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, and began diverting government medical research funds into research of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine.

== Alternative medicine ==

The concept of alternative medicine is problematic as it cannot exist autonomously as an object of study in its own right but must always be defined in relation to a non-static and transient medical orthodoxy. It also divides medicine into two realms, a medical mainstream and fringe, which, in privileging orthodoxy, presents difficulties in constructing an historical analysis independent of the often biased and polemical views of regular medical practitioners. The description of non-conventional medicine as alternative reinforces both its marginality and the centrality of official medicine. Although more neutral than either pejorative or promotional designations such as &quot;quackery&quot; or &quot;natural medicine&quot;, cognate terms like &quot;unconventional&quot;, &quot;heterodox&quot;, &quot;unofficial&quot;, &quot;irregular&quot;, &quot;folk&quot;, &quot;popular&quot;, &quot;marginal&quot;, &quot;complementary&quot;, &quot;integrative&quot; or &quot;unorthodox&quot; define their object against the standard of conventional biomedicine, entail particular perspectives and judgements, often carry moral overtones, and can be inaccurate. Conventional medical practitioners in the West have, since the nineteenth century, used some of these and similar terms as a means of defining the boundary of &quot;legitimate&quot; medicine, marking the division between that which is scientific and that which is not. The definition of mainstream medicine, generally understood to refer to a system of licensed medicine which enjoys state and legal protection in a jurisdiction, is also highly specific to time and place. In countries such as India and China traditional systems of medicine, in conjunction with Western biomedical science, may be considered conventional and mainstream. The shifting nature of these terms is underlined by recent efforts to demarcate between alternative treatments on the basis of efficacy and safety and to amalgamate those therapies with scientifically adjudged value into complementary medicine as a pluralistic adjunct to conventional practice. This would introduce a new line of division based upon medical validity.

== Before the &quot;fringe&quot; ==

Prior to the nineteenth century European medical training and practice was ostensibly self-regulated through a variety of antique corporations, guilds or colleges. Among regular practitioners, university trained physicians formed a medical elite while provincial surgeons and apothecaries, who learnt their art through apprenticeship, made up the lesser ranks. In Old Regime France, licenses for medical practitioners were granted by the medical faculties of the major universities, such as the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Access was restricted and successful candidates, amongst other requirements, had to pass examinations and pay regular fees. In the Austrian Empire medical licences were granted by the Universities of Prague and Vienna. Amongst the German states the top physicians were academically qualified and typically attached to medical colleges associated with the royal court. The theories and practices included the science of anatomy and that the blood circulated by a pumping heart, and contained some empirically gained information on progression of disease and about surgery, but were otherwise unscientific, and were almost entirely ineffective and dangerous.

Outside of these formal medical structures there were myriad other medical practitioners, often termed irregulars, plying a range of services and goods. The eighteenth-century medical marketplace, a period often referred to as the &quot;Golden Age of quackery&quot;, was a highly pluralistic one that lacked a well-defined and policed division between &quot;conventional&quot; and &quot;unconventional&quot; medical practitioners. In much of continental Europe legal remedies served to control at least the most egregious forms of &quot;irregular&quot; medical practice but the medical market in both Britain and American was less restrained through regulation. Quackery in the period prior to modern medical professionalisation should not be considered equivalent to alternative medicine as those commonly deemed quacks were not peripheral figures by default nor did they necessarily promote oppositional and alternative medical systems. Indeed, the charge of &#x27;quackery&#x27;, which might allege medical incompetence, avarice or fraud, was levelled quite indiscriminately across the varied classes of medical practitioners be they regular medics, such as the hierarchical, corporate classes of physicians, surgeons and apothecaries in England, or irregulars such as nostrum mongers, bonesetters and local wise-women. Commonly, however, quackery was associated with a growing medical entrepreneurship amongst both regular and irregular practitioners in the provision of goods and services along with associated techniques of advertisement and self-promotion in the medical marketplace. The constituent features of the medical marketplace during the eighteenth century were the development of medical consumerism and a high degree of patient power and choice in the selection of treatments, the limited efficacy of available medical therapies, and the absence of both medical professionalisation and enforced regulation of the market.

== Medical professionalisation ==

In the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries regular and irregular medical practitioners became more clearly differentiated throughout much of Europe. In part, this was achieved through processes of state-sanctioned medical regulation. The different types of regulatory medical markets created across nineteenth-century Europe and America reflected differing historical patterns of state formation. Where states had traditionally enjoyed strong, centralised power, such as in the German states, government more easily assumed control of the medical regulation. In states that had exercised weaker central power and adopted a free-market model, such as in Britain, government gradually assumed greater control over medical regulation as part of increasing state focus on issues of public health. This process was significantly complicated in Britain by the enduring existence of the historical medical colleges. A similar process is observable in America from the 1870s but this was facilitated by the absence of medical corporations. Throughout the nineteenth century, however, most Western states converged in the creation of legally delimited and semi-protected medical markets. It is at this point that an &quot;official&quot; medicine, created in cooperation with the state and employing a scientific rhetoric of legitimacy, emerges as a recognisable entity and that the concept of alternative medicine as a historical category becomes tenable.

France provides perhaps one of the earliest examples of the emergence of a state-sanctioned medical orthodoxy – and hence also of the conditions for the development of forms of alternative medicine – the beginnings of which can be traced to the late eighteenth century. In addition to the traditional French medical faculties and the complex hierarchies of practitioners over which they presided, the state increasingly supported new institutions, such as the Société Royale de Médecine (&quot;Royal Society of Medicine&quot;) which received its royal charter in 1778, that played a role in policing medical practice and the sale of medical nostrums. This system was radically transformed during the early phases of the French Revolution when both the traditional faculties and the new institutions under royal sponsorship were removed and an entirely unregulated medical market was created. This anarchic situation was reformed under the exigencies of war when in 1793 the state established national control over medical education; under Napoleon in 1803 state-control was extended over the licensing of medical practitioners. This latter reform introduced a new hierarchical division between practitioners in the creation of a medical élite of graduate physicians and surgeons, who were at liberty to practice throughout the state, and the lowly &quot;officiers de santé&quot; who received less training, could only offer their services to the poor, and were restricted in where they could practice. This national system of medical regulation under state-control, exported to regions of Napoleonic conquest such as Italy, the Rhineland and the Netherlands, became paradigmatic in the West and in countries adopting western medical systems. While offering state protection to licensed doctors and establishing a medical monopoly in principle it did not, however, remove competition from irregular practitioners.

== Nineteenth-century non-conventional medicine ==

From the late eighteenth century and more robustly from the mid-nineteenth century a number of non-conventional medical systems developed in the West which proposed oppositional medical systems, criticised orthodox medical practitioners, emphasised patient-centredness, and offered substitutes for the treatments offered by the medical mainstream. While neither the medical marketplace nor irregular practitioners disappeared during the nineteenth century, the proponents of alternative medical systems largely differed from the entrepreneurial quacks of the previous century in eschewing showy self-promotion and instead adopting a more sober and serious self-presentation. The relationship between medical orthodoxy and heterodoxy was complex, both categories contained considerably variety, were subject to substantial change throughout the period, and the divisions between the two were frequently blurred.

Many alternative notions grew out of the Lebensreform movement, which emphasized the goodness of nature, the harms to society, people, and to nature caused by industrialization, the importance of the whole person, body and mind, the power of the sun, and the goodness of &quot;the old ways&quot;.

The variety of alternative medical systems which developed during this period can be approximately categorised according to the form of treatment advocated. These were: those employing spiritual or psychological therapies, such as hypnosis (mesmerism); nutritional therapies based upon special diets, such as medical botany; drug and biological therapies such as homeopathy and hydrotherapy; and, manipulative physical therapies such as osteopathy and chiropractic massage. Non-conventional medicine might define health in terms of concepts of balance and harmony or espouse vitalistic doctrines of the body. Illness could be understood as due to the accretion of bodily toxins and impurities, to result from magical, spiritual, or supernatural causes, or as arising from energy blockages in the body such that healing actions might constitute energy transfer from practitioner to patient.

=== Mesmerism ===

Mesmerism is the medical system proposed in the late eighteenth century by the Viennese-trained physician, Franz Anton Mesmer (1734–1815), for whom it is named. The basis of this doctrine was Mesmer&#x27;s claimed discovery of a new aetherial fluid, animal magnetism, which, he contended, permeated the universe and the bodies of all animate beings and whose proper balance was fundamental to health and disease. Animal magnetism was but one of series of postulated subtle fluids and substances, such as caloric, phlogiston, magnetism, and electricity, which then suffused the scientific literature. It also reflected Mesmer&#x27;s doctoral thesis, &quot;De Planatarum Influxu&quot; (&quot;On the Influence of the Planets&quot;), which had investigated the impact of the gravitational effect of planetary movements on fluid-filled bodily tissues. His focus on magnetism and the therapeutic potential of magnets was derived from his reading of Paracelsus, Athanasius Kircher and Johannes Baptista van Helmont. The immediate impetus for his medical speculation, however, derived from his treatment of a patient, Franzisca Oesterlin, who suffered from episodic seizures and convulsions which induced vomiting, fainting, temporary blindness and paralysis. His cure consisted of placing magnets upon her body which consistently produced convulsive episodes and a subsequent diminution of symptoms. According to Mesmer, the logic of this cure suggested that health was dependent upon the uninterrupted flow of a putative magnetic fluid and that ill health was consequent to its blockage. His treatment methods claimed to resolve this by either directly transferring his own superabundant and naturally occurring animal magnetism to his patients by touch or through the transmission of these energies from magnetic objects.
By 1775 Mesmer&#x27;s Austrian practice was prospering and he published the text &quot;Schrieben über die Magnetkur an einen auswärtigen Arzt&quot; which first outlined his thesis of animal magnetism. In 1778, however, he became embroiled in a scandal resulting from his treatment of a young, blind patient who was connected to the Viennese court and relocated to Paris where he established a medical salon, &quot;The Society of Harmony&quot;, for the treatment of patients. Recruiting from a client-base drawn predominantly from society women of the middle- and upper-classes, Mesmer held group &quot;séances&quot; at his salubrious salon-clinic which was physically dominated by a large, lidded, wooden tank, known as the &quot;baquet&quot;, containing iron, glass and other material that Mesmer had magnetized and which was filled with &quot;magnetized water&quot;. At these sessions patients were enjoined to take hold of the metal rods emanating from the tub which acted as a reservoir for the animal magnetism derived from Mesmer and his clients. Mesmer, through the apparent force of his will – not infrequently assisted by an intense gaze or the administration of his wand – would then direct these energies into the afflicted bodies of his patients seeking to provoke either a &quot;crisis&quot; or a trance-like state; outcomes which he believed essential for healing to occur. Patient proclamations of cure ensured that Mesmer enjoyed considerable and fashionable success in late-eighteenth-century Paris where he occasioned something of a sensation and a scandal.

Popular caricature of mesmerism emphasised the eroticised nature of the treatment as spectacle: &quot;Here the physician in a coat of lilac or purple, on which the most brilliant flowers have been painted in needlework, speaks most consolingly to his patients: his arms softly enfolding her sustain her in her spasms, and his tender burning eye expresses his desire to comfort her&quot;. Responding chiefly to the hint of sexual impropriety and political radicalism imbuing these &quot;séances&quot;, in 1784 mesmerism was subject to a commission of inquiry by a royal-appointed scientific panel of the prestigious French Académie de Médicine. Its findings were that animal magnetism had no basis in fact and that Mesmer&#x27;s cures had been achieved through the power of suggestion. The commission&#x27;s report, if damaging to the personal status of Mesmer and to the professional ambitions of those faculty physicians who had adopted mesmeric practices, did little to hinder the diffusion of the doctrine of animal magnetism.


In England mesmerism was championed by John Elliotson, Professor of Practical Medicine at University College London and the founder and president of the London Phrenological Society. A prominent and progressive orthodox physician, he was President of the Medico-Chirugical Society of London and an early adopter of the stethoscope in English medical practice. He had been introduced to mesmerism in the summer of 1837 by the French physician and former student of Mesmer, Dupotet, who is credited as the most significant cross-channel influence on the development of mesmerism in England. Elliotson believed that animal magnetism provided the basis for a consideration of the mind and will in material terms thus allowing for their study as medical objects. Initially supported by &quot;The Lancet&quot;, a reformist medical journal, he contrived to demonstrate the scientific properties of animal magnetism as a physiological process on the predominantly female charity patients under his care in the University College Hospital. Working-class patients were preferred as experimental subjects to exhibit the physical properties of mesmerism on the nervous system as, being purportedly more animalistic and machine-like than their social superiors, their personal characteristics were deemed less likely to interfere with the experimental process. He sought to reduce his subjects to the status of mechanical automata claiming that he could, through the properties of animal magnetism and the pacifying altered states of consciousness which it induced, &quot;play&quot; their brains as if they were musical instruments.

Two Irish-born charity patients, the adolescent O&#x27;Key sisters, emerged as particularly important to Elliotson&#x27;s increasingly popular and public demonstrations of mesmeric treatment. Initially, his magnetising practices were used to treat the sisters&#x27; shared diagnosis of hysteria and epilepsy in controlling or curtailing their convulsive episodes. By the autumn of 1837 Elliotson had ceased to treat the O&#x27;Keys merely as suitable objects for cure and instead sought to mobilise them as diagnostic instruments. When in states of mesmeric entrancement the O&#x27;Key sisters, due to the apparent increased sensitization of their nervous system and sensory apparatus, behaved as if they had the ability to see through solid objects, including the human body, and thus aid in medical diagnosis. As their fame rivalled that of Elliotson, however, the O&#x27;Keys behaved less like human diagnostic machines and became increasingly intransigent to medical authority and appropriated to themselves the power to examine, diagnose, prescribe treatment and provide a prognosis. The emergence of this threat to medical mastery in the form of a pair of working-class, teenage girls without medical training aroused general disquiet amongst the medical establishment and cost Elliotson one of his early and influential supporters, the leading proponent of medical reform, Thomas Wakley. Wakley, the editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, had initially hoped that Elliotson&#x27;s scientific experiments with animal magnetism might further the agenda of medical reform in bolstering the authority of the profession through the production of scientific truth and, equally importantly in a period when the power-relations between doctors and patients were being redefined, quiescent patient bodies. Perturbed by the O&#x27;Key&#x27;s provocative displays, Wakely convinced Elliotson to submit his mesmeric practice to a trial in August 1838 before a jury of ten gentlemen during which he accused the sisters of fraud and his colleague of gullibility. Following a series of complaints issued to the Medical Committee of University College Hospital they elected to discharge the O&#x27;Keys along with other mesmeric subjects in the hospital and Elliotson resigned his post in protest.

This set-back, while excluding Elliotson from the medical establishment, ended neither his mesmeric career nor the career of mesmerism in England. From 1842 he became an advocate of phreno-mesmerism – an approach that amalgamated the tenets of phrenology with animal magnetism and that led to a split in the Phrenological Society. The following year he founded, together with the physician and then President of the Phrenological Society, William Collins Engledue, the principal journal on animal magnetism entitled &quot;The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology and Mesmerism and their Application to Human Welfare&quot;, a quarterly publication which remained in print until its fifty-second issue in January 1856. Mesmeric societies, frequently patronised by those among the scientific and social elite were established in many major population centres in Britain from the 1840s onwards. Some sufficiently endowed societies, such as those in London, Bristol and Dublin, Ireland, supported mesmeric infirmaries with permanent mesmeric practitioners in their employ. Due to the competing rise of spiritualism and psychic research by the mid-1860s these mesmeric infirmaries had closed.

The 1840s in Britain also witnessed a deluge of travelling magnetisers who put on public shows for paying audiences to demonstrate their craft. These mesmeric theatres, intended in part as a means of soliciting profitable private clientele, functioned as public fora for debate between skeptics and believers as to whether the performances were genuine or constituted fraud. In order to establish that the loss of sensation under mesmeric trance was real, these itinerant mesmerists indulged in often quite violent methods – including discharging firearms close to the ears of mesmerised subjects, pricking them with needles, putting acid on their skin and knives beneath their fingernails.

Such displays of the anaesthetic qualities of mesmerism inspired some medical practitioners to attempt surgery on subjects under the spell of magnetism. In France, the first major operation of this kind had been trialled, apparently successfully, as early as 1828 during a mastectomy procedure. In Britain the first significant surgical procedure undertaken on a patient while mesmerised occurred in 1842 when James Wombell, a labourer from Nottingham, had his leg amputated. Having been mesmerised for several days prior to the operation by a barrister named William Topham, Wombell exhibited no signs of pain during the operation and reported afterwards that the surgery had been painless. This account was disputed by many in the medical establishment who held that Wombell had fraudulently concealed the pain of the amputation both during and after the procedure. Undeterred, in 1843 Elliotson continued to advocate for the use of animal magnetism in surgery publishing &quot;Numerous Cases of Surgical Operation without Pain in the Mesmeric State&quot;. This marked the beginning of a campaign by London mesmerists to gain a foothold for the practice within British hospitals by convincing both doctors and the general public of the value of surgical mesmerism. Mesmeric surgery enjoyed considerable success in the years from 1842 to 1846 and colonial India emerged as a particular stronghold of the practice; word of its success was propagated in Britain through the &quot;Zoist&quot; and the publication in 1846 of &quot;Mesmerism in India and its Practical Application in Surgery and Medicine&quot; by James Esdaile, a Scottish surgeon with the East India Company and the chief proponent of animal magnetism in the subcontinent.

Although a few surgeons and dentists had undertaken fitful experiments with anaesthetic substances in the preceding years, it was only in 1846 that use of ether in surgery was popularised amongst orthodox medical practitioners. This was despite the fact that the desensitising effects of widely available chemicals like ether and nitrous oxide were commonly known and had formed part of public and scientific displays over the previous half-century.

A feature of the dissemination of magnetism in the New World was its increasing association with spiritualism. By the 1830s mesmerism was making headway in the United States amongst figures like the intellectual progenitor of the New Thought movement, Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, whose treatment combined verbal suggestion with touch. Quimby&#x27;s most celebrated &quot;disciple&quot;, Mary Baker Eddy, would go on to found the &quot;medico-religious hybrid&quot;, Christian Science, in the latter half of the nineteenth century. In the 1840s the American spiritualist Andrew Jackson Davis sought to combine animal magnetism with spiritual beliefs and postulated that bodily health was dependent upon the unobstructed movement of the &quot;spirit&quot;, conceived as a fluid substance, throughout the body. As with Quimby, Davis&#x27;s healing practice involved the use of touch. 

=== Thomsonianism ===
Thomsonianism was an early 19th century American-based system of alternative medicine, developed and promoted by Samuel Thomson. It grew rapidly during the Popular Health Movement when many Americans distrusted expertise in general and physicians in particular. It was based on herbal treatments designed to regulate body heat, and rejected drugs, heavy bleeding and surgery. The cult faltered and factionalized in the 1850s, and was largely a spent force by the 1860s. However, its emphasis on herbal remedies was copied by other herbalist sects.

=== Osteopathic and chiropractic manipulation ===

Deriving from the tradition of &#x27;bone-setting&#x27; and a belief in the flow of supernatural energies in the body (vitalism), both osteopathy and chiropractic developed in the US in the late 19th century. The British School of Osteopathy was established in 1917 but it was the 1960s before the first chiropractic college was established in the UK. Chiropractic theories and methods (which are concerned with subluxations or small displacements of the spine and other joints) do not accord with orthodox medicine&#x27;s current knowledge of the biomechanics of the spine. in addition to teaching osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM) and theory, osteopathic colleges in the US gradually came to have the same courses and requirements as biomedical schools, whereby osteopathic doctors (ODs) who did practice OMM were considered to be practicing conventional biomedicine in the US. The passing of the Osteopaths Act (1993) and the Chiropractors Act (1994), however, created for the first time autonomous statutory regulation for two CAM therapies in the UK.

==== History of chiropractic ====

Chiropractic began in the United States in 1895. when Daniel David Palmer performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, who then claimed he could hear better as a result of the manipulation. Palmer opened a school of chiropractic two years later. Chiropractic&#x27;s early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other unscientific constructs. Palmer claimed to merge science and metaphysics. Palmer&#x27;s first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic described the body as a &quot;machine&quot; whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure, that spinal manipulation could improve health, and that the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.

Despite their similarities, osteopathic practitioners sought to differentiate themselves by seeking regulation of the practices. In a 1907 test of the new law, a Wisconsin based chiropractor was charged with practicing osteopathic medicine without a license. Practicing medicine without a license led to many chiropractors, including D.D. Palmer, being jailed. Chiropractors won their first test case, but prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and successful. Chiropractors responded with political campaigns for separate licensing statutes, from osteopaths, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.

Divisions developed within the chiropractic profession, with &quot;mixers&quot; combining spinal adjustments with other treatments, and &quot;straights&quot; relying solely on spinal adjustments. A conference sponsored by the National Institutes of Health in 1975 spurred the development of chiropractic research. In 1987, the American Medical Association called chiropractic an &quot;unscientific cult&quot; and boycotted it until losing a 1987 antitrust case.

== Histories of individual traditional medical systems ==

=== Ayurvedic medicine ===

Ayurveda or ayurvedic medicine has more than 5,000 years of history, now re-emerging as texts become increasingly accessible in modern English translations. These texts attempt to translate the Sanskrit versions that have remained hidden in India since British occupation from 1755 to 1947. As modern archaeological evidence from Harappa and Mohenja-daro is distributed, Ayurveda has now been accepted as the world&#x27;s oldest concept of health and disease discovered by man and the oldest continuously practiced system of medicine. Ayurveda is a world view that advocates man&#x27;s allegiance and surrender to the forces of Nature that are increasingly revealed in modern physics, chemistry and biology. It is based on an interpretation of disease and health that parallels the forces of nature, observing the sun&#x27;s fire and making analogies to the fires of the body; observing the flows in Nature and describing flows in the body, terming the principle as Vata; observing the transformations in Nature and describing transformations in the body, terming the principle as Pitta; and observing the stability in Nature and describing stability in the body, terming the principle as Kapha.

Ayurveda can be defined as the system of medicine described in the great medical encyclopedias associated with the names Caraka, Suśruta, and Bhela, compiled and re-edited over several centuries from about 200 BCE to about 500 CE and written in Sanskrit. These discursive writings were gathered and systematized in about 600 CE by Vāgbhaṭa, to produce the &quot;Aṣṭāṅgahṛdayasaṃhitā&quot; (&#x27;Heart of Medicine Compendium&#x27;) that became the most popular and widely used textbook of ayurvedic medicine in history. Vāgbhaṭa&#x27;s work was translated into many other languages and became influential throughout Asia.

Its prehistory goes back to Vedic culture and its proliferation in written form flourished in Buddhist times. Although the hymns of the Atharvaveda and the Ṛgveda mention some herbal medicines, protective amulets, and healing prayers that recur in the ciphered slokas of later ayurvedic treatises, the earliest historical mention of the main structural and theoretical categories of ayurvedic medicine occurs in the Buddhist Pāli Tripiṭaka, or Canon.

Ayurveda originally derived from the Vedas, as the name suggests, and was first organized and captured in Sanskrit in ciphered form by physicians teaching their students judicious practice of healing. These ciphers are termed slokas and are purposefully designed to include several meanings, to be interpreted appropriately, known as &#x27;tantra yukti&#x27; by the knowledgeable practitioner. Ayu means longevity or healthy life, and veda means human-interpreted and observable truths and provable science. The principles of Ayurveda include systematic means for allowing evidence, including truth by observation and experimentation, pratyaksha; attention to teachers with sufficient experience, aptoupadesha; analogy to things seen in Nature, anumana; and logical argument, yukti.

It was founded on several principles, including yama (time) and niyama (self-regulation) and placed emphasis on routines and adherence to cycles, as seen in Nature. For example, it directs that habits should be regulated to coincide with the demands of the body rather than the whimsical mind or evolving and changing nature of human intelligence. Thus, for the follower of ayurvedic medicine, food should only be taken when they are instinctively hungry rather than at an arbitrarily set meal-time. Ayurveda also teaches that when a person is tired, it is not wise to eat food or drink, but to rest, as the body&#x27;s fire is low and must gather energy in order to alight the enzymes that are required to digest food. The same principles of regulated living, called Dinacharya, direct that work is the justification for rest and in order to get sufficient sleep, one should subject the body to rigorous exercise. Periodic fasting, or abstaining from all food and drink for short durations of one or two days helps regulate the elimination process and prevents illness. It is only in later years that practitioners of this system saw that people were not paying for their services, and in order to get their clients to pay, they introduced herbal remedies to begin with and later even started using metals and inorganic chemical compositions in the form of pills or potions to deal with symptoms.

Emigration from the Indian sub-continent in the 1850s brought practitioners of Ayurveda (&#x27;Science of Life&#x27;). a medical system dating back over 2,500 years, its adoption outside the Asian communities was limited by its lack of specific exportable skills and English-language reference books until adapted and modernised forms, New Age Ayurveda and Maharishi Ayurveda, came under the umbrella of CAM in the 1970s to Europe. In Britain, Unani practitioners are known as hakims and Ayurvedic practitioners are known as vaidyas. Having its origins in the Ayurveda, Indian naturopathy incorporates a variety of holistic practices and natural remedies and became increasingly popular after the arrival of the post-Second World War wave of Indian immigrants. The Persian work for Greek, Unani medicines uses some similar materials as Ayurveda but are based on philosophy closer to Greek and Arab sources than to Ayurveda. Exiles fleeing the war between Yemen and Aden in the 1960s settled nearby the ports of Cardiff and Liverpool and today practitioners of this Middle Eastern medicine are known as vaids..

In the US, Ayurveda has increased popularity since the 1990s, as Indian-Americans move into the mainstream media, and celebrities visit India more frequently. In addition, many Americans go to India for medical tourism to avail of reputed Ayurvedic medical centers that are licensed and credentialed by the Indian government and widely legitimate as a medical option for chronic medical conditions. AAPNA, the Association of Ayurvedic Professionals of North America, www.aapna.org, has over 600 medical professional members, including trained vaidyas from accredited schools in India credentialed by the Indian government, who are now working as health counselors and holistic practitioners in the US. There are over 40 schools of Ayurveda throughout the US, providing registered post-secondary education and operating mostly as private ventures outside the legitimized medical system, as there is no approval system yet in the US Dept of Education. Practitioners graduating from these schools and arriving with credentials from India practice legally through the Health Freedom Act, legalized in 13 states. Credentialing and a uniform standard of education is being developed by the international CAC, Council of Ayurvedic Credentialing, www.cayurvedac.com, in consideration of the licensed programs in Ayurveda operated under the Government of India&#x27;s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Dept of AYUSH. In India, there are over 600,000 practicing physicians of Ayurveda. Ayurveda is a legal and legitimate medical system in many countries of South Asia.

=== Chinese culture ===

Traditional Chinese medicine has more than 4,000 years of history as a system of medicine that is based on a philosophical concept of balance ( yin and yang, Qi, Blood, Jing, Bodily fluids, the Five Elements, the emotions, and the spirit) approach to health that is rooted in Taoist philosophy and Chinese culture. As such, the concept of it as an alternative form of therapeutic practise is only found in the Western world.

The arrival into Britain of thousands of Chinese in the 1970s introduced traditional Chinese medicine – a system dating back to the Bronze Age or earlier that used acupuncture, herbs, diet and exercise. Today there are more than 2,000 registered practitioners in the UK.

== Since the 1970s ==

Until the 1970s, western practitioners that were not part of the medical establishment were referred to &quot;irregular practitioners&quot;, &quot;drugless healers&quot;, or &quot;sanipractors&quot;, and were dismissed by the medical establishment as unscientific or quackery. Irregular practice became increasingly marginalized as quackery and fraud, as western medicine increasingly incorporated scientific methods and discoveries, and had a corresponding increase in success of its treatments. In the 1970s, irregular practices were grouped with traditional practices of nonwestern cultures, and with other unproven or disproven practices that were not part of biomedicine, and the entire group began to be marketed and promoted as &quot;alternative medicine&quot;. Following the counterculture movement of the 1960s, misleading marketing campaigns promoting &quot;alternative medicine&quot; as an effective &quot;alternative&quot; to biomedicine, and with changing social attitudes about not using chemicals, challenging the establishment and authority of any kind, sensitivity to giving equal measure to values and beliefs of other cultures and their practices through cultural relativism, adding postmodernism and deconstructivism to ways of thinking about science and its deficiencies, and with growing frustration and desperation by patients about limitations and side effects of evidence-based medicine, use of alternative medicine in the west began to rise, then had explosive growth beginning in the 1990s, when senior level political figures began promoting alternative medicine, and began diverting government medical research funds into research of alternative, complementary, and integrative medicine.

=== 1990s through 2010s ===

In 1991, after United States Senator Thomas Harkin became convinced his allergies were cured by taking bee pollen pills, he used $2 million of his discretionary funds to create the Office of Alternative Medicine (OAM), to test the efficacy of alternative medicine and alert the public as the results of testing its efficacy. The OAM mission statement was that it was &quot;dedicated to exploring complementary and alternative healing practices in the context of rigorous science; training complementary and alternative medicine researchers; and disseminating authoritative information to the public and professionals.&quot; Joseph M. Jacobs was appointed the first director of the OAM in 1992. Jacobs&#x27; insistence on rigorous scientific methodology caused friction with Senator Harkin. Harkin criticized the &quot;unbendable rules of randomized clinical trials&quot; and, citing his use of bee pollen to treat his allergies, stated: &quot;It is not necessary for the scientific community to understand the process before the American public can benefit from these therapies.&quot; Increasing political resistance to the use of scientific methodology was publicly criticized by Dr. Jacobs and another OAM board member complained that &quot;nonsense has trickled down to every aspect of this office&quot;. In 1994, Senator Harkin responded by appearing on television with cancer patients who blamed Dr. Jacobs for blocking their access to untested cancer treatment, leading Jacobs to resign in frustration. The OAM drew increasing criticism from eminent members of the scientific community, from a Nobel laureate criticizing the degrading parts of the NIH to the level a cover for quackery, and the president of the American Physical Society criticizing spending on testing practices that &quot;violate basic laws of physics and more clearly resemble witchcraft&quot;. In 1998, the President of the North Carolina Medical Association publicly called for shutting down the OAM. The NIH Director placed the OAM under more strict scientific NIH control.

In 1998, Sen. Harkin responded to the criticism and stricter scientific controls by the NIH, by raising the OAM to the level of an independent center, increasing its budget to $90 million annually, and renaming it to be the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM). The United States Congress approved the appropriations without dissent. NCCAM had a mandate to promote a more rigorous and scientific approach to the study of alternative medicine, research training and career development, outreach, and integration. In 2014 the agency was renamed to the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH). The NCCIH charter requires that 12 of the 18 council members shall be selected with a preference to selecting leading representatives of complementary and alternative medicine, 9 of the members must be licensed practitioners of alternative medicine, 6 members must be general public leaders in the fields of public policy, law, health policy, economics, and management, and 3 members must represent the interests of individual consumers of complementary and alternative medicine.

In 2001, the White House had commissioned the &quot;White House Commission on Complementary and Alternative Medicine Policy.&quot;

By 2009, the NCCIH budget had grown from annual spending of about $2 million at its inception, to $123 million annually. In 2009, after a history of 17 years of government testing produced almost no clearly proven efficacy of alternative therapies, Senator Harkin complained, &quot;One of the purposes of this center was to investigate and validate alternative approaches. Quite frankly, I must say publicly that it has fallen short. It think quite frankly that in this center and in the office previously before it, most of its focus has been on disproving things rather than seeking out and approving.&quot; Members of the scientific and biomedical communities complained in 2009 that after 10 years of being tested, at a cost of over $2.5 Billion on testing scientifically and biologically implausible practices, almost no alternative therapy showed clear efficacy.

From 1990 to 1997, use of alternative medicine in the US increased by 25%, with a corresponding 50% increase in expenditures. By 2013, 50% of Americans were using alternative medicine, and annual spending on CAM in the US was $34 Billion.

=== 2010s to present ===
In 2017 the National Health Service (NHS) in England stopped funding homeopathy &quot;as the lack of any evidence for its effectiveness did not justify the cost.&quot; A 2018 UK High Court judgement upheld the NHS decision to cease homeopathy funding.

=== Other periods ===

The terms &#x27;alternative&#x27; and &#x27;complementary&#x27; tend to be used interchangeably to describe a wide diversity of therapies that attempt to use the self-healing powers of the body by amplifying natural recuperative processes to restore health. In ancient Greece the Hippocratic movement, commonly regarded as the fathers of medicine, actually gave rise to modern naturopathy and indeed much of today&#x27;s CAM. They placed great emphasis on a good diet and healthy lifestyle to restore equilibrium; drugs were used more to support healing than to cure disease.

Complementary medicines have evolved through history and become formalised from primitive practices; although many were developed during the 19th century as alternatives to the sometimes harmful practices of the time, such as blood-lettings and purgation. In the UK, the medical divide between CAM and conventional medicine has been characterised by conflict, intolerance and prejudice on both sides and during the early 20th century CAM was virtually outlawed in Britain: healers were seen as freaks and hypnotherapists were subject to repeated attempts at legal restriction. The alternative health movement is now accepted as part of modern life, having progressed from a grass-roots revival in the 1960s reacting against environmental degradation, unhealthy diets and rampant consumerism.

Until the arrival of the Romans in AD43, medical practices were limited to a basic use of plant materials, prayers and incantations. Having assimilated the corpus of Hippocrates, the Romans brought with them a vast repertoire of herbal treatments and introduced the concept of the hospital as a centralised treatment centre. In Britain, hydrotherapy (the use of water either internally or externally to maintain health and prevent disease) can be traced back to Roman spas. This was augmented by practices from the Far East and China introduced by traders using the Silk Road.

During the Catholic and Protestant witch-hunts from the 14th to the 17th centuries, the activities of traditional folk-healers were severely curtailed and knowledge was often lost as it existed only as an oral tradition. The widespread emigration from Europe to North America in the 18th and 19th centuries included both the knowledge of herbalism and some of the plants themselves. This was combined with Native American medicine and then re-imported to the UK where it re-integrated with the surviving herbal traditions to evolve as today&#x27;s medical herbalism movement.

The natural law of similia similibus curantur, or &#x27;like is cured by like&#x27;, was recognised by Hippocrates but was only developed as a practical healing system in the early 19th century by a German, Dr Samuel Hahnemann. Homeopathy was brought to the UK in the 1830s by a Dr Quinn who introduced it to the British aristocracy, whose patronage continues to this day. Despite arousing controversy in conventional medical circles, homeopathy is available under the National Health Service, and in Scotland approximately 25% of GPs hold qualifications in homeopathy or have undergone some homeopathic training.

The impact on CAM of mass immigration into the UK is continuing into the 21st century. Originating in Japan, cryotherapy has been developed by Polish researchers into a system that claims to produce lasting relief from a variety of conditions such as rheumatism, psoriasis and muscle pain. Patients spend a few minutes in a chamber cooled to −110 °C, during which skin temperature drops some 12 °C.

The use of CAM is widespread and increasing across the developed world. The British are presented with a wide choice of treatments from the traditional to the innovative and technological. Section 60 of the Health Act 1999 allows for new health professions to be created by Order rather than primary legislation. This raises issues of public health policy which balance regulation, training, research, evidence base and funding against freedom of choice in a culturally diverse society.

== Relativist perspective ==

The term alternative medicine refers to systems of medical thought and practice which function as alternatives to or subsist outside of conventional, mainstream medicine. Alternative medicine cannot exist absent an established, authoritative and stable medical orthodoxy to which it can function as an alternative. Such orthodoxy was only established in the West during the nineteenth century through processes of regulation, association, institution building and systematised medical education.

<text>Maxwell Caulfield (born Maxwell P.J. Newby; 23 November 1959) is a British actor. He has appeared in &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982), &quot;Electric Dreams&quot; (1984), &quot;The Boys Next Door&quot; (1985), &quot;The Supernaturals&quot; (1986), &quot;&quot; (1989), &quot;Waxwork 2&quot; (1992), &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993), &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995), &quot;The Real Blonde&quot; (1997), &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot; (1997), and in &quot;A Prince for Christmas&quot; (2015). In 2015, Caulfield toured Australia with his wife Juliet Mills and sister-in-law Hayley Mills in the comedy &quot;Legends!&quot; by Pulitzer Prize winner James Kirkwood. He voiced James Bond in the video game &quot;James Bond 007: Nightfire&quot; (2002). He most recently stars in the Netflix movie &quot;The Merry Gentlemen&quot; (2024).

He is best remembered internationally for his starring role as Miles Colby during the 1980s on the American TV series &quot;Dynasty&quot; and its spin off &quot;The Colbys&quot;.

==Early life, family and education==
Maxwell P.J. Newby was born on 23 November 1959 in Belper, Derbyshire, the elder son of Peter Newby and Oriole Rosalind Findlater. His younger brother, Marcus, is also an actor. By 1965, his parents had parted, and his mother legally abandoned the surname Newby in favour of her maiden name. 

Caulfield&#x27;s American stepfather reportedly kicked him out of the house at the age of 15. 

==Career==
===Theatre===
His stage debut in London was dancing in a &quot;nude show&quot; to music by Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd. Being an exotic dancer at London&#x27;s Windmill Theatre led to him obtaining an Equity card, enabling him to work as an actor. After obtaining a green card, relocated from the UK to the US at age 18, making his New York City debut in a gay farce, &quot;Hot Rock Hotel&quot; (1978). The following year, in &quot;Class Enemy&quot; (1979) (which eventually went Off-Broadway), he played the lead role and won a Theatre World Award for his performance. He made his Los Angeles debut in &quot;Hitting Town&quot; (1980) and appeared in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; (1980) that same year, during which he met his future wife, actress Juliet Mills.

In the early 1980s, Caulfield was an active member of the Mirror Repertory Company, part of The Mirror Theater Ltd, performing in numerous repertory productions including &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Inheritors&quot; and &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;. He made his debut Off-Broadway in 1981 as the title character, a homicidal drifter, in Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Entertaining Mr. Sloane&quot; (alongside Joseph Maher and Barbara Bryne). His performance was widely praised; one critic wrote:
Caulfield made his Broadway debut in J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot; opposite Siân Phillips. He performed opposite Stacy Keach in &quot;Sleuth&quot; in Los Angeles in 1988. He appeared with Jessica Tandy and Elizabeth Wilson in &quot;Salonika&quot; at the Public Theater in New York, appearing fully nude for much of the play, and in Joe Orton&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Loot&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. In 2006, Caulfield drew attention over his bare-chested scene in the Off-Broadway two-hander &quot;Tryst&quot;, opposite Amelia Campbell. In 2007, he performed in the Charles Busch play &quot;Our Leading Lady&quot; with Kate Mulgrew.

In 2007, Caulfield made his West End debut as Billy Flynn in the long-running London production of &quot;Chicago&quot;; he then resumed the role of Flynn for the Broadway production in November 2007. In 2011, he appeared in an Off-Broadway production of the comedy &quot;Cactus Flower&quot;.

On 14 April 2024, Caulfield appeared in the 10th Anniversary Concert of &quot;Cool Rider (the Greasiest Sequel)&quot; at the London Palladium, playing the role Mr. Stuart and performing the song &quot;Reproduction&quot;.

===Television===
Caulfield has appeared on &quot;Dynasty&quot; (1985–1986), &quot;The Colbys&quot; (1985–1987), &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (1988–1991), &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; (1990), &quot;The Rockford Files: Godfather Knows Best&quot; (1996), &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (1995–1998), &quot;Casualty&quot; (2003–2004), &quot;Emmerdale&quot; (2009–2010) and &quot;NCIS&quot; (2013). He guest-starred on &quot;Modern Family&quot; (Season 4, Episode 16, &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;) playing Claire&#x27;s ex-boyfriend and college professor.

===Feature films===
Caulfield is especially known for his role in &quot;Grease 2&quot; (1982). Some of his other films include &quot;The Real Blonde&quot; with Matthew Modine and Daryl Hannah (1997; opened the Sundance Film Festival) &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (1993), and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Little&quot; (1997). Another memorable role is in &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995). 

Although he did not work regularly as a child actor, at the age of seven he played Ted in the 1967 film &quot;Accident&quot; and was billed as Maxwell Findlater.

==Personal life==
Caulfield has been married since 1980 to actress Juliet Mills, daughter of actor Sir John Mills and writer Lady Mills (née Mary Hayley Bell), and is a brother-in-law of Jonathan Mills and actress Hayley Mills. Caulfield is stepfather to Melissa (née Miklenda; Mills&#x27; daughter from her second marriage) and Sean Caulfield (born Sean Alquist; Mills&#x27; son from her first marriage).

<text>Juliet Maryon Mills (born 21 November 1941) is a British-American actress. 

Mills began her career as a child actress and was nominated at age 18 for a Tony Award for her stage performance in &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot; in 1960. She progressed to film work and then to television, playing the lead role on the sitcom &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot; in the early 1970s. She received Golden Globe Award nominations for her work in this series and for her role in the film &quot;Avanti!&quot; in 1972. She won an Emmy Award for her performance in the television miniseries &quot;QB VII&quot; (1974). 

In 1983, Mills joined The Mirror Theater Ltd&#x27;s Mirror Repertory Company, performing in repertory productions such as &quot;Rain&quot;, &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Inheritors&quot; and &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; throughout their seasons. From 1999 until 2008, she had a role on the daytime drama series &quot;Passions&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award.

==Early life==

Mills was born on 21 November 1941 in London during World War II, though her parents, actor Sir John Mills and playwright Mary Hayley Bell, soon moved the family to the country to be away from the Luftwaffe bombing raids. She is the elder sister of actress Hayley Mills and director Jonathan Mills. 

Because of her parents&#x27; careers, Mills grew up surrounded by famous actors, including Rex Harrison, David Niven and Marlon Brando. She recalled her childhood in the 2000 documentary film &quot;Sir John Mills&#x27; Moving Memories&quot;, written by her brother. Her godmother was actress Vivien Leigh, and her godfather was playwright Noël Coward. She attended the Elmhurst Ballet School, in Camberley, Surrey.

==Career==
As a child, Mills appeared as an extra in various films, including a role as Freda&#x27;s 11-week-old baby in the 1942 film &quot;In Which We Serve&quot;, starring her father. Her first major role came in 1958, when she was 16, as Pamela Harrington in the Peter Shaffer play &quot;Five Finger Exercise&quot;. The show ran one year in London, and then moved to the Music Box Theatre on Broadway. In 1960, Mills was nominated for a Tony Award as &quot;Best Featured Actress&quot; for her performance as Pamela.

Mills appeared as a stowaway dressed as a man, but daughter of a ship&#x27;s gunner, in episode 2 of &quot;Sir Francis Drake&quot; was one of her first TV appearances (1961) and was echoed by an almost identical role in the 1964 film &quot;Carry On Jack&quot;.
In the 1960s, Mills would appear both in films and on television. She had a role in the film, &quot;The Rare Breed&quot; with James Stewart and Maureen O&#x27;Hara, and on television series such as &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and &quot;12 O&#x27;Clock High&quot;. She has stated that the highlight of her film career was &quot;Avanti!&quot; (1972), directed by Billy Wilder, in which she starred opposite Jack Lemmon and for which she received a Golden Globe Award nomination in 1973. In 1974, Mills starred alongside fellow English actor Richard Johnson in the Italian horror film &quot;Beyond the Door&quot;, playing the role of Jessica Barrett, a woman who becomes demonically possessed after an unplanned pregnancy. The movie was a major success, making over $15 million at the box office, though the producers were sued by Warner Bros due to similarities to &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. Mills also appeared in a two-part 1978 episode of the TV series &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, playing Barbara Danver, wife of Alan Danver, played by Dan Rowan.

In 1969, Mills was cast in the American television series &quot;Nanny and the Professor&quot;, which premiered on ABC in January, 1970. Mills played Phoebe Figalilly, a nanny with seemingly magical powers, reminiscent of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Mills has stated that she herself believes in magic, witches and fairies: &quot;There&#x27;s a lot more, you know, in the aether and around us ... We have guides, and we have angels taking care of us ... I believe in metaphysics, in a big way.&quot; She was again nominated for a Golden Globe Award in 1971 for the same role. Despite strong ratings, the series ran only for two seasons, in 1970 and 1971. After the show was moved from a timeslot near &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and &quot;The Brady Bunch&quot;, two highly successful sitcoms, to a different night of the week, ratings fell eventually leading to its cancellation.

In 1974, Mills won an Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Single Performance by a Supporting Actress in a Comedy or Drama Special&quot; for her performance in the miniseries adaptation of &quot;QB VII&quot;. During the 1974–75 television season, she also had a recurring role as Dr. Claire Hanley on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Born Free&quot;. In 1980, Mills returned to the stage, starring in &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;, with Maxwell Caulfield, who became her third husband.

Mills was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992, when she was surprised by Michael Aspel during the curtain call of the play &quot;Fallen Angels&quot; at the Richmond Theatre.

In 1999, Mills was cast on the daytime drama &quot;Passions&quot; as Tabitha Lenox, a witch who was burned at the stake in the 17th century. Initially, the character wished harm on other people, but in a June 2007 episode, the character was declared a &quot;good witch&quot;. Mills was nominated for her first Daytime Emmy Award for &quot;Outstanding Lead Actress&quot; for the role.

&quot;Passions&quot; ended in August, 2008. In 2009, Mills joined the cast the ITV drama &quot;Wild at Heart&quot;, playing Georgina, the sister of a character played in the previous series by her real-life sister Hayley. She also guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Hot in Cleveland&quot; as Philipa Scroggs, the mother of Joy (played by Jane Leeves).

==Personal life==

Mills has been married three times. The first time was from 1961 to 1964, to Russell Alquist, Jr., with whom she had a son, Sean. Her second marriage was from 1975 to 1980 to Michael Miklenda, with whom she had a second child, a daughter, Melissa. While married to Miklenda, Mills appeared on &quot;Tattletales&quot;, and claimed she did not agree with women&#x27;s liberation because the theatre does not discriminate. 

In 1980, Mills married Maxwell Caulfield, 18 years her junior. Mills said of the age difference, &quot;Everybody is always interested in the fact that I am married to someone who is a lot younger than I am ... There are no rules, and that&#x27;s what I believe, because age doesn&#x27;t really matter. If you meet someone that you&#x27;re really close to, someone that you love, stick with that.&quot;

Mills became a naturalized United States citizen on October 10, 1975.

<doc id="627262" wikidata="Q4775102" url="?curid=627262" title="Antiphonary of St. Benigne">
<text>The Antiphonary tonary missal of St. Benigne (also called Antiphonarium Codex Montpellier or Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon) was written in the last years of the 10th century, when the Abbot William of Volpiano at St. Benignus of Dijon reformed the liturgy of several monasteries in Burgundy. The chant manuscript records mainly Western plainchant of the Roman-Frankish proper Mass and part of the chant sung during the matins (&quot;Gregorian chant&quot;), but unlike the common form of the Gradual and of the Antiphonary, William organized his manuscript according to the chant genre (antiphons with psalmody, alleluia verses, graduals, offertories, and proses for the missal part), and these sections were subdivided into eight parts according to the octoechos. This disposition followed the order of a tonary, but William of Volpiano wrote not only the incipits of the classified chant, he wrote the complete chant text with the music in central French neumes which were still written in &quot;campo aperto&quot;, and added a second alphabetic notation of his own invention for the melodic structure of the codified chant.

== Historical background ==

This particular type of a fully notated tonary only appeared in Burgundy and Normandy. It can be regarded as a characteristic document of a certain school founded by William of Volpiano. He was reforming abbot at St. Benignus of Dijon since 989. In 1001 he followed a request by Duke Richard II and became first abbot at the Abbey of Fécamp which was a reforming centre of monasticism in Normandy.

Only this manuscript was written during the time of William by the same hand as several other manuscripts of the Library of the Medical Faculty of Montpellier (today &quot;Bibliothèque interuniversitaire de Médecin&quot;) which all belong to St. Bénigne. It is not known, whether it was really written by William of Volpiano in person. The few things known about him can be read in a hagiographic source, the &quot;Vita domni Willelmi&quot; in fourteen chapters written by his disciple, the Burgundian monk Raoul Glaber in 1031, and revised probably by demand of the later Abbot John of Fécamp during the late 11th century. William was born as son of the Alemannic Duke Robert of Volpiano at the citadel of his family on the San Giulio Island of the Lake Orta in Piedmont. The legend said that Emperor Otto had conquered this island, while William was born, so the Emperor became his godfather and he was educated as a monk and made his monastic career at Cluny Abbey during the reform of Abbot Majolus who continued the reform of his predecessor Odo and supported reforms connected with papal reform policies under influence of the Ottonic Emperors. Concerning liturgical reforms, Emperor Otto I already emphasized the need for a reform of monasticism in Southern Italy and to abandon local liturgies in favour of the Roman rite, a kind of second Carolingian reform, and he already wished to &quot;liberate&quot; Arab Sicily and to organize church provinces of the island which was mainly populated by Muslims and by Greek Christians. His plan failed after the catastrophic defeat of his son Otto II near Crotone, but the role of Cluny as a centre for liturgical reforms had increased in Ottonic times.

William&#x27;s reforms were not only concerned with liturgy and the new design of local chant books, but also with the construction of new churches and buildings for abandoned abbeys, with canon law, with the organization of grammar schools and even rural communities of Normandy. It was typical for a career at Cluny Abbey to get one of the most prestigious positions as a cantor and to continue as a reforming abbot in another Abbey, which was subjected to this powerful and ambitious Abbey. As Abbot of St. Benignus William reformed several monasteries of Burgundy, Lorraine and the Île-de-France. There are some testimonies like the &quot;Libellus de revelatione, edificatione et auctoritate Fiscannensis monasterii&quot;, a chronicle of Fécamp, which reports certain resentments against Norman culture and its local liturgical customs. William appeared as a Cluniac reformer, but studies of his liturgical reform especially of the Office chant for Fécamp did not confirm, that he just removed local in favour of Cluniac customs. Within the reform and the history of Norman monasticism, the reform of William of Volpiano was neither the beginning nor its climax, as a reformer he had to find a balance between local needs and problems and certain interests of the Cluniac Abbot, of the Pope, and of the Norman patrons, whose founding activities cultivated a new form of policy. William contributed to this history with the foundation of an own school.

According to Véronique Gazeau he did not spend too much time in Normandy during the period about 30 years of his Norman activities, but nevertheless his school could be established, because he ordained his students as abbots. He was not only Abbot at Fécamp, but also at Jumièges between 1015 and 1017. He became first Abbot of Bernay, a foundation of Countess Judith, Richard II&#x27;s wife, in 1025. By order of Duke Robert he left Fécamp for John of Ravenna in 1028, before 1027 he was assisted at the Abbey at Bernay by a &quot;custos&quot; Thierry, an elder and experienced monk and prior from Saint-Bénigne of Dijon. Before he followed Suppo as prior at Mont-Saint-Michel in 1023. These administrative changes were caused by the establishment of monastic centres during certain periods, in which some Abbeys were no longer guided by an abbot, but by a prior of the community who was often called &quot;custos&quot;, and several new foundations did not always start as an Abbey, they were subordinated to older abbeys. These monastic centres which had the control over various monasteries including former abbeys, were used to control new foundations as well as to obey liturgical and administrative reforms. This practice was continued after William&#x27;s death, Fécamp and Saint-Bénigne were controlled by one abbot between 1052 and 1054: Abbot John of Ravenna. When the new founded monasteries became abbeys, the abbots were usually chosen among the monks of Fécamp.

Only few writings by William have survived in the Abbey of Fécamp, but it is not always easy to decide, if the collection of Montpellier which belonged obviously to the library of the Abbey St. Benignus of Dijon, had this Abbey as destination. Michel Huglo remarked that the last part of the manuscript H 159, the real Antiphonary with antiphons and responsories for the Matins, was continued by the 13th-century copy of the Antiphonary of the Abbey of Fécamp (Rouen, Bibliothèque municipale, Ms. 254, olim A.190). Thus, the destination of the Tonary of Saint-Bénigne is still a matter of discussion. On the other hand, customs of St. Bénigne like the liturgy for the patron can also be found in other Abbeys as Fécamp and Bernay, and the tonaries of Dijon (Montpellier, Ms. H159), of Fécamp (Rouen, Ms. 244, olim A.261), and of Jumièges (Rouen, Ms. 248, olim A.339) are so consistent that they can be regarded as documents of one school which can be ascribed to William of Volpiano.

== Alphabetic notation invented by William of Volpiano ==

One of William&#x27;s innovations as a cantor and notator was an alphabetic pitch notation. Its point of reference was the Boethian diagram, which displayed the double octave of the &quot;systema teleion&quot; in the diatonic (semitonium-tonus-tonus), the chromatic (semitonium-semitonium-trihemitonium), and the enharmonic tetrachord (diesis-diesis-ditonus). The different positions were represented by alphabetical letters, except the dieses which had special signs not unlike the tyronic letters used by Boethius:

This alphabetic pitch notation not only offers insights into microtonal shifts used by the cantors of this local school, it proves that the common projection of the piano keyboard on the medieval tone system is inadequate. Like many other letter systems used since the 8th century, also the system of William of Volpiano represented the positions of the Boethian diagram, and the enharmonic signs used for the dieses represented not a change into another genus, but microtonal attractions within the diatonic melos of a certain mode.

Concerning the diesis Guido of Arezzo wrote about 1026 in his treatise &quot;Micrologus&quot; that the diesis sharpens the usual tonus between re-mi (a-b; d-e; g-h or h-i) with the proportion 9:8 by a proportion of 7:6 (a-˫; d-˧; g-Γ or h-˥). Guido&#x27;s explanation, how to find this interval at the monochord, made it already evident that the diesis, taken from the &quot;enharmonic&quot; division of the tetrachord, was used here as a microtonal shift in different melodic modes of the diatonic genus.

== Composition ==

The Tonary of Saint-Bénigne of Dijon is organized in a very rare form of a fully notated tonary, which serves like a fully notated music manuscript for Mass (gradual) and office chant (antiphonary).

The first division of the chant book is between the book&#x27;s gradual (ff. 13r-155v) and an antiphonary fragment (ff. 156r-162v) which has the Matins for Palm Sunday, St. Blasius and St. Hylarius in the conventional liturgical order, but with tonal rubrics. The last leaf was added from another book to use the blank versoside for additions on the last pages written by other hands, chant notated in adiastematic neumes but without alphabetic notation and even diastematic neumes with alphabetic notation (ff. 160r-163r).

The gradual itself with proper Mass chant is divided into six parts: The first are antiphons (introits and communions) (ff. 13r-53r). The next three parts are chant genres which precedes lessons: alleluia verses for gospel readings (ff. 53v-69r), the benedictiones (hymnus trium puerorum) for prophetic readings (ff. 75r-76v), and the graduels which followed epistle readings (ff. 77r-98v). The last two parts are an &quot;offertorial&quot; (ff. 99r-151r) and a tractus collection or proser (ff. 69r-74v; 151v-155v), dedicated to the genre which replace the alleluia verses during fasten time for all kinds of scriptural readings.

The third level of division are the eight parts according to the oktoechos in the order of autentus protus, plagi proti, autentus deuterus etc. In the first part, every tonal section has all introits according to the liturgical year cycle and then all communions according to the liturgical order. The whole disposition is not new, but it is identical with tonaries from different regions of the Cluniac Monastic Association. The only difference is, that every chant is not represented by an incipit, it is fully notated in neumes and in alphabetic notation as well. Thanks to this manuscript, even cantors who do not know the chant, can memorize the melody together with its tonus.

As an example might serve the Introitus &quot;Repleatur os meum&quot; used as a refrain for Psalm 70 during the procession into the church, at the beginning of the morning Mass on Saturday before Pentecost. The introit was written in the first part of the antiphons and is quite at the beginning of the deuterus section (written as heading on each page), hence an introit in the 3rd tone or &quot;autentus deuterus&quot;:

The beginning with the psalm incipit and the ending of the psalmody, here called &quot;differentia&quot; no. &quot;ii&quot;, follows the antiphon. The antiphons of the entrance (introits) have the gradual order of the Mass as a rubric at the margin (on a verso page as here: left), i.e. the serial for the day with &quot;gradual&quot; (R), &quot;alleluia&quot; (All) or &quot;tractus&quot; (TR), &quot;offertorium&quot; (OF), and &quot;communio&quot; (CO). A conventional tonary with the list of &quot;differentiae&quot; was also attached to the beginning of the manuscript. It was used as an index to find the &quot;differentia&quot; no. ii or melodic ending used during the recitation of the psalm - here the incipit refers to Psalm 70 of the Vulgata. This tonary is preceded by an alleluia collection written in central French neumes in campo aperto.

The style of William of Volpiano&#x27;s tonary which follows, is unique, and Michel Huglo called it one of the finest tonaries which survived in the manuscript collections today. The scribe used red ink for the chant text and different colours to decorate its initials, while the neume and the alphabetic notation was written in black ink.

== William of Volpiano&#x27;s contribution to the evolution of musical notation ==

William of Volpiano&#x27;s innovation of the notation system did not change the habits of central French neume notation, it just added an own alphabetic pitch notation. Often it was not clear how the letters refer to the neumes. Letter groups usually refer to the group of a ligature, but sometimes neumes were added as well to the letters to help the reading cantor for the coordination.

Among the monastic reforms of Normandy William of Volpiano was an important protagonist among the local abbots, but his alphabetic notation was only used over the following centuries in the Norman monasteries of his school, but never in the later Italo-Norman manuscripts which were rather influenced by the Aquitanian school (a few manuscripts used central French neumes, but without alphabetic notation). Within the Cluniac Monastic Association, the cantors of the following generation like Adémar de Chabannes who was taught by his uncle Roger at Saint-Martial Abbey of Limoges (Aquitaine), developed a new diastematic neume notation which allowed to indicate the ligatures, even if they were separated by the vertical disposition according to their pitch class. His innovation was imitated by Italian cantors, first in Northern Italy than in other reform centres of the 11th century like Benevento and Monte Cassino. During the 12th century one are two lines were added to help the scribe and the reader for a constant vertical orientation.

After the first generation of fully notated neume manuscripts written since the early 10th century, the particular notation system represent a transition between the adiastematic and diastematic neumes. During the 11th century a lot of local traditions, different from the chant repertory of the Roman-Frankish reform, were codified the first time in diastematic neumes: Old Beneventan chant (Beneventan neumes without lines), Ravenna chant (Beneventan neumes), Old Roman chant (Roman neumes without lines), Ambrosian or Milanese chant (square neumes on a penta- or tetragramm).

<text>The No. 2 Construction Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF), was raised in Nova Scotia and was one of two predominantly Black battalions in Canadian military history and the only Canadian battalion composed of Black soldiers to serve in World War I. Commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Hugh Sutherland, formerly of the 193rd Battalion, CEF.

==Historical context==

Captain Runchey&#x27;s Company of Coloured Men was one of the first Black regiments in Canada and served during the War of 1812. Another Black regiment raised in Canada was the Victoria Rifles (Nova Scotia) (1860–61), which was established just after the Crimean War on the eve of the American Civil War. They were led by Captain Anderson, who eventually resigned his command over how poorly the battalion was treated by local military establishment.

With the outbreak of the First World War, Canadians were excited to serve their country and many flocked to recruiting stations from British Columbia to Nova Scotia. This included hundreds of Black Canadians who were also eager and willing to serve. However, at the time few Black people were serving in the Canadian military because of the racial attitudes then prevalent. This time was no different and Black people attempted to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, but most were rejected and were told that it&#x27;s a &quot;White man&#x27;s war.&quot; The Department of Militia and Defence&#x27;s policy towards recruitment was to defer to the judgement of the individual commanding officer, and since many held deeply ingrained beliefs about the inferiority of Black people, very few were accepted. However, military officials eventually authorized the creation of a Black unit, the No. 2 Construction Battalion.

== Recruitment ==

On May 11, 1916, the War Office informed the governor general that it approved of the formation of this unit. So on July 5, 1916, No. 2 Construction Battalion was authorized. Its headquarters was initially in Pictou, Nova Scotia, but moved to Truro, Nova Scotia, in September 1916.

The original intention was to recruit the unit primarily from the Maritimes, with companies also being raised in Ontario and Western Canada. A little over a month after the unit was authorized, however, only 180 recruits had been obtained. By November 1916, the recruiting situation had improved little, leading Lieutenant Colonel Sutherland to propose raising a company in the British West Indies. While nothing came of this (it was claimed that troops from the West Indies would be unsuitable for France’s cold weather), the battalion did manage to obtain about 165 men from the United States. When the men were finally assembled in March 1917 to prepare for departure overseas, the battalion&#x27;s overall strength was just over 729 men. During their deployment, new troops of other nationalities, including 150 Russians, were attached to the unit. Although a Black unit, all but one of the unit&#x27;s 19 officers were white, the exception being Captain William A. White, the unit&#x27;s chaplain.

== Deployment ==
The unit departed from Halifax, Nova Scotia, on board the SS &quot;Southland&quot; on March 28, 1917 and arrived at Liverpool, England, ten days later.

Lacking the numbers to make up a battalion (the smallest unit then deployed by army authorities), the unit was reorganized as No. 2 Construction Company in May 1917, and attached to the Canadian Forestry Corps (CFC). By the fall of 1917, the unit was operating in the Jura Mountains of France, headquartered at [[Lajoux, France|La Joux

The unit conducted several operations crucial to the war effort. In conjunction with the CFC, troops of the No. 2 Construction Company axed down the trees of surrounding forests, transported the logs to mills, and milled them into lumber to be used on the front by [[Allies of World War I|Allied armies]]. Horses, trucks, and trains were used to transport the logs. The No. 2 Construction Company was responsible for handling and caring for the 70-100 horses. It drove the trucks and maintained the roads. It built a railroad and occasionally operated the trains. It was also responsible for operating and maintaining utilities for CFC camps, such as water pumps and an electrical power plant.

All this work was done despite terrible weather conditions and frequent breakouts of disease. The men worked hard, once setting a record by milling 95,000 board measures of wood in 10 hours with the help of No. 21 Company, CFC.

The men of No. 2 Construction Company returned to Canada in early 1919 and the unit officially disbanded on September 15 of the same year.

== Legacy ==
In 1981, the [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia| Society for the Protection and Preservation of Black Culture in Nova Scotia]], which had been incorporated in 1977, chose as its first public event a reunion of Black First World War veterans. This reunion was held November 12–14, 1982, in Halifax and was attended by nine of the approximately twenty known surviving Black veterans. They were: William Carter (No. 2), John W. Hamilton (No. 2), Percy J. Richards (No. 2), Gordon C. Wilson (No. 2), Albert D. Deleon ([[Canadian Forestry Corps|CFC]]), A. Seymour Tyler (No. 2), Sydney M. Jones (106BN, [[The Royal Canadian Regiment|The RCR]]), [[Isaac Phills]] ([[85th Battalion (Nova Scotia Highlanders), CEF|85BN]]), and John R. Pannill (Merchant Navy).

In 1992, the No. 2 Construction Battalion, CEF, was designated an event of national historic significance by the government of Canada, and a commemorative plaque was placed in [[Pictou, Nova Scotia]], the following year.

In February 2007, the [[Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia]] successively acquired a [[Victory Medal (United Kingdom)|Victory Medal]] for a former member of the unit, Sapper PR. P.F. Fenton, by Dave Thomson of [[St. George, Ontario]], for over $7,400 that was being auctioned on eBay.

On June 1, 2022, the battalion was awarded the theatre of war honour &quot;France and Flanders, 1917–18&quot;, and the perpetuation of the unit was assigned to the [[Canadian Military Engineers]], with [[4 Engineer Support Regiment]] having the privilege of publicly recognizing the perpetuation.
The 2001 documentary film &quot;[[Honour Before Glory]]&quot;, produced by [[Anthony Sherwood]], is based on White&#x27;s wartime diary, which recorded the hardships faced by the Black soldiers, such as lack of proper clothing and medical care. In July 2022, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau apologized for the &quot;blatant anti-Black hate and systemic racism&quot; endured by the battalion&#x27;s soldiers.

In October 2024 a new building at the [[5th Canadian Division Support Base Detachment Aldershot]] near [[Kentville]] was named &quot;Private Frederick L. Landsay and Private James E. Landsay Building&quot; in honour of two brothers who served with the battalion. The Landsays grew up in the nearby Pine Woods neighbourhood.

<doc id="627269" wikidata="Q735329" url="?curid=627269" title="Sámi shamanism">
<text>Traditional Sámi spiritual practices and beliefs are based on a type of animism, polytheism, and what anthropologists may consider shamanism. The religious traditions can vary considerably from region to region within Sápmi. 

Traditional Sámi religion is generally considered to be Animism. The Sámi belief that all significant natural objects (such as animals, plants, rocks, etc.) possess a soul, and from a polytheistic perspective, traditional Sámi beliefs include a multitude of spirits. Sámi traditional beliefs and practices commonly emphasizes veneration of the dead and of animal spirits. The relationship with the local animals that sustain the people, such as the reindeer, are very important to the kin-group.

== Deities and animal spirits ==
Aside from bear worship, there are other animal spirits such as the Haldi who watch over nature. Some Sámi people have a thunder god called Horagalles. Rana Niejta is &quot;the daughter of the green, fertile earth&quot;. The symbol of the world tree or pillar, which reaches up to the North Star and is similar to that found in Finnish mythology, may also be present.

Laib Olmai, the forest spirit of some of the Sámi people, is traditionally associated with forest animals, which are regarded as his herds, and he is said to grant either good or bad luck in hunting. His favour was so important that, according to one author, believers said prayers and made offerings to him every morning and every evening.

== Sieidis ==

In the landscape throughout Northern Scandinavia, one can find &quot;sieidis&quot;, places that have unusual land forms different from the surrounding countryside, and that can be considered to have spiritual significance. Each family or clan has its local spirits, to whom they make offerings for protection and good fortune. The &quot;Storjunkare&quot; are described sometimes as stones, having some likeness to a man or an animal, that were set up on a mountain top, or in a cave, or near rivers and lakes. Honor was done to them by spreading fresh twigs under them in winter, and in summer leaves or grass. The &quot;Storjunkare&quot; had power over all animals, fish, and birds, and gave luck to those that hunted or fished for them. Reindeer were offered up to them, and every clan and family had its own hill of sacrifice.

== Noaidi ==

A &quot;noaidi&quot; is a mediator between the human world and &quot;saivo&quot;, the underworld, on the behalf of the community, usually using a Sámi drum and a domestic flute called a fadno in ceremonies.

== Ancestors ==
One of the most irreconcilable elements of the Sámi&#x27;s worldview from the missionaries’ perspective was the notion &quot;that the living and the departed were regarded as two halves of the same family.&quot; The Sámi regarded the concept as fundamental, while Protestant Christian missionaries absolutely discounted any possibility of the dead having anything to do with the living. Since this belief was not just a religion, but a living dialogue with their ancestors, their society was concomitantly impoverished.

== List of deities ==
The Sami religion differs somewhat between regions and tribes. Although the deities are similar, their names vary between regions. The deities also overlap: in one region, one deity can appear as several separate deities, and in another region, several deities can be united in to just a few. Because of these variations, the deities can be somewhat confused with each other. 

The main deities of the Sami were as follows:

* Akka - a group of fertility goddesses, including Maderakka, Sarakka Juksakka and Uksakka
* Beaivi - goddess of the sun, mother of human beings. However, in some areas the sun is male
* Bieggagallis - husband of the sun goddess, father of human beings
* Bieggolmai &#x27;Man of the Winds&#x27; - god of the winds
* Biejjenniejte - goddess of healing and medicine, daughter of the Sun, Beaivi 
* Horagalles - god of thunder. His name may mean &quot;Thor-man&quot;. He is also called &quot;Grandfather&quot;, Bajanolmmai, Dierpmis, Pajonn and Tordöm.
* Jahbme akka - the goddess of the dead, and mistress of the underworld and the realm of the dead 
* Ipmil &#x27;God&#x27; - adopted as a native name for the Christian God (see the related Finnish word Jumala), also used for Radien-attje 
* Lieaibolmmai - god of the hunt and of adult men
* Madder-Attje - husband of Maderakka and father of the tribe. While his wife gives newborns their bodies, he gives them their souls. 
* Mano, Manna, or Aske - god of the moon
* Mubpienålmaj - the god of evil, influenced by the Christian Satan
* Radien-attje - Creator and high god, the creator of the world and the head divinity. In Sámi religion, he is passive or sleeping and is not often included in religious practice. He created the souls of human beings with his spouse. He was also called Waralden Olmai.
* Raedieahkka - wife of the high god Radien-attje. She created the souls of human beings with her spouse. 
* Rana Niejta - spring goddess, the daughter of Radien-attje and Raedieahkka. &quot;Rana&quot;, meaning &quot;green&quot; or by extension &quot;fertile&quot;, was a popular name for Sámi girls. 
* Radien-pardne - the son of Radien-attje and Raedieahkka. He acts as the proxy of his passive father, performing his tasks and carrying out his will. 
* Ruohtta - god of sickness and death. He was depicted riding a horse.
* Stallo - feared cannibal giants of the wilderness
* Tjaetsieålmaj - &quot;the man of water&quot;, god of water, lakes and fishing

<doc id="627271" wikidata="Q5366551" url="?curid=627271" title="Elmer Fung">
<text>Elmer Fung or Fung Hu-hsiang (; 8 May 1948 – 25 September 2021) was a Taiwanese politician. A member of the New Party, he represented Taipei City in the Legislative Yuan from 1999 to 2002. In 2000, he and Li Ao formed the New Party presidential ticket, which finished fifth.

==Academic career==
Fung graduated from Tunghai University in 1970, majoring in chemistry. He then completed his Master&#x27;s degree at National Taiwan University in 1974. After that, Fung went to America and earned a PhD at Boston University in 1978.

Fung became the head of the Department of Philosophy of Tunghai University in 1979. He co-chaired the Research Center of Philosophy of the same college from 1983 to 1986. After leaving Tunghai, Fung served as the Dean of College of Liberal Arts of National Central University from 1986 to 1988.

==Political career==
Fung was secretary to President Chiang Ching-kuo from 1979 to 1986; advisor to premier Hau Pei-tsun from 1991 to 1992; an honorary chairman of the Service Centre Across the Taiwan Strait; and a member of the National Assembly. In 1986, Chen Shui-bian was jailed for eight months for libel after his pro-opposition magazine accused, among other things, Fung of plagiarism. His argument in court was he merely translated an English book for his doctoral thesis. The court ruled in his favor and sentenced Chen Shui-bian to jail for libel.

He and Li Ao formed the New Party ticket in the 2000 presidential election. Only Fung showed up to represent the New Party at a post-election press conference, where he stated that Chen Shui-bian won only because President Lee Teng-hui chose to &quot;Dump Lien to save Chen.&quot;

Shortly after the election, First Lady of the Republic of China Tseng Wen-hui sued Fung, Hsieh Chi-ta, and Tai Chi for defamation. The three were cleared of charges, but fined upon appeal to the Taiwan High Court. Hsieh refused to pay the fine and was imprisoned for three months. The Supreme Court heard an appeal of the case in 2010, and upheld the rulings for both Fung and Tai.

In 2001, the Taiwan Association of University Professors ranked him at the top of a list delineating thirteen of the worst legislators. Shortly after stepping down from the Legislative Yuan in 2002, Fung started a business in China.

In 2003, investigator Ko Ching-ming named Fung one of the people who had collaborated with the Taiwan Garrison Command in 1974 to from National Taiwan University, where Fung was then a student.

In February 2004, a Taiwan-based foreign labourers&#x27; organization publicly accused Fung of raping his Filipina housekeeper. At least two incidents were alleged to have occurred, once in November 2003 and another in January 2004. Soon after the accusation, Democratic Progressive Party legislators discussed removing Fung from his position as a counselor to the legislature. On 8 July 2005 the presiding judge found him guilty based on matching DNA evidence. The decision was appealed to the Taiwan High Court, which upheld the ruling in 2007 and again in 2008. After the first High Court ruling, the Supreme Court offered to review the case. The Taiwan High Court heard the case again, and in February 2012 had cleared Fung of the charges because the housekeeper had made a statement recanting her accusations. However, in December, the High Court chose to reverse its ruling, stating that the housekeeper&#x27;s earlier statements and assorted medical evidence showed that the accusation was not a lie. After a total of seven High Court trials, the Supreme Court ruled on the case in October 2016, and sentenced Fung to three years and four months imprisonment. Fung claimed he was severely ill, and his sentence was suspended until the completion of a health examination. Fung eventually served 85 days of the sentence before he was released on medical parole in January 2017.

==Death==
Fung fell in mid-September 2021, and sought medical treatment for a fracture. During his hospital stay, doctors discovered that cancer had recurred, and Fung died on 25 September 2021.

<text>The European Committee for Standardization (CEN, ) is a public standards organization whose mission is to foster the economy of the European Single Market and the wider European continent in global trading, the welfare of European citizens and the environment by providing an efficient infrastructure to interested parties for the development, maintenance and distribution of coherent sets of standards and specifications.

The CEN was founded in 1961. Its thirty-four national members work together to develop [[European Standard|European Standards]] (ENs) in various sectors to build a European internal market for goods and services and to position Europe in the global economy. CEN is officially recognized as a European standards body by the European Union, European Free Trade Association and the United Kingdom; the other official European standards bodies are the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).

More than 60,000 technical experts as well as business federations, consumer and other societal interest organizations are involved in the CEN network that reaches over 460 million people. CEN is the officially recognized standardization representative for sectors other than electrotechnical (CENELEC) and telecommunications (ETSI). On 12 February 1999, the European Parliament noted in a resolution that CEN, CENELEC and ETSI co-operate smoothly and that a merger of the three standardization bodies would not have clear advantages.

The standardization bodies of the thirty national members represent the twenty seven member states of the European Union, three countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), the United Kingdom and other countries that are highly integrated into the European economy. CEN is contributing to the objectives of the European Union and European Economic Area with technical standards (EN standards) which promote free trade, the safety of workers and consumers, interoperability of networks, environmental protection, exploitation of research and development programmes, and public . An example of harmonized standards are those for materials and products used in construction and listed under the Construction Products Directive. The CE mark is a declaration by the manufacturer that a product complies with all relevant EU directives.

CEN (together with CENELEC) provide a CEN/CENELEC platform for the development of European Standards and other technical specifications across a wide range of sectors, also ensuring that standards correspond with any relevant EU legislation.

CEN (together with CENELEC) owns the Keymark, a voluntary quality mark for products and services. A product bearing the Keymark demonstrates conformity to European Standards.

==History==

On June 9, 2022, it was announced that ASTM International and CEN have agreed to extend and expand a Technical Cooperation Agreement from 2019.

==Membership==
The current CEN Members are:
* all member states of the European Union; 
* three of the EFTA members: Iceland, Norway, Switzerland; and 
* other states: United Kingdom, North Macedonia, Turkey, Serbia.

The current affiliates are Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Moldova, Montenegro, Morocco, Tunisia and Ukraine.

The current partner standardization bodies are Australia, Canada, Mongolia, and Kazakhstan.

== Vienna Agreement ==

The Vienna Agreement was signed by CEN and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1991 but came in force in the mid-2000s. Its primary aim is to avoid duplication of (potentially conflicting) standards between CEN and ISO. In the last decade CEN has adopted a number of ISO standards which replaced the corresponding CEN standards.

<text>The  (, &quot;Paris Mint&quot;) is a government-owned institution responsible for producing France&#x27;s coins. Founded in AD 864 with the Edict of Pistres, it is the oldest continuously running minting institution and one of the oldest extant companies in the world.

In 1973, the mint relocated its primary production to a facility in Pessac, and today the original facility in Paris, while still operational, functions primarily as a museum and is home to a collection of many ancient coins.

Monnaie de Paris acquired its autonomy and was granted legal personality by law no. 2006–1666 in 2007.

In 2012, it was the first public institution to obtain the Living Heritage Company label.

At the end of September 2017, Monnaie de Paris reopened after renovation work.

==Building in Paris==

A Neoclassical edifice, the Hôtel de la Monnaie was designed by Jacques-Denis Antoine and built from 1767–1775 on the Left Bank of the Seine. The Monnaie was the first major civic monument undertaken by Antoine, yet shows a high level of ingenuity on the part of the architect. Today it is considered a key example of French Neoclassicism in pre-Revolutionary Paris. The building is typified by its heavy external rustication and severe decorative treatment. It boasts one of the longest façades on the Seine; its appearance has been likened to the Italian palazzo tradition. The building, which housed mint workshops, administrative rooms, and residential quarters, wraps around a large interior courtyard. It remains open to the public and includes a numismatics museum, located within what was once the main foundry.

==Development==
The Monnaie de Paris employs 500 people (in 2010) on two sites: the Hôtel de la Monnaie in Paris (55% of the workforce) and the monetary establishment in Pessac, in Gironde (45%). In 2019, turnover amounted to 134 million euros for a workforce of 489 employees.

Following a 5-year renovation project known as Metalmetamorphose, the museum at the Monnaie de Paris – known as the Musée du Conti (11 Conti Museum) – was reopened on 30 September 2017.

<text>MythBusters is a science entertainment television series created by Peter Rees and produced by Australia&#x27;s Beyond Television Productions. The series premiered on the Discovery Channel on January 23, 2003. It was broadcast internationally by many television networks and other Discovery channels worldwide. The show&#x27;s original hosts, special effects experts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, used elements of the scientific method to test the validity of rumors, myths, movie scenes, adages, Internet videos, and news stories.

Filmed in San Francisco and edited in Artarmon, New South Wales, &quot;MythBusters&quot; aired 282 total episodes before its cancellation at the end of the 2016 season in March. Planning and some experimentation took place at Hyneman&#x27;s workshops in San Francisco; experiments requiring more space or special accommodations were filmed on location, typically around the San Francisco Bay Area and other locations in northern California, going to other states or even countries on occasion when required. During the second season, members of Savage&#x27;s and Hyneman&#x27;s behind-the-scenes team were organized into a second team of MythBusters (&quot;The Build Team&quot;). They generally tested myths separately from the main duo and operated from another workshop. This arrangement continued until August 2014, when it was announced at the end of &quot;Plane Boarding&quot; that Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara would be leaving the show. Savage and Hyneman subsequently hosted the final two seasons alone. On October 21, 2015, it was announced that &quot;MythBusters&quot; would air its 14th and final season in 2016. The show aired its final episode with the original cast on March 6, 2016.

Kari Byron, Tory Belleci, and Grant Imahara, former MythBusters stars, led the Netflix show &quot;White Rabbit Project&quot;, which premiered on December 9, 2016. Through experiments and tests, they delve into topics like jailbreaks, superpower technology, heists, and WWII weapons. The series was canceled after one season.

On November 15, 2017, sister network Science Channel revived the series with new hosts Jon Lung and Brian Louden, who were selected via the competition spin-off &quot;&quot;. The revival was filmed in Santa Clarita and on location in other parts of Southern California, airing for two seasons that lasted until 2018. Savage would later return in &quot;MythBusters Jr.&quot;, a spin-off featuring children.

In 2021, Beyond Television produced and aired a new title of the franchise, &quot;Motor Mythbusters&quot;, for MotorTrend. Belleci returned for the series and was joined by engineer Bisi Ezerioha and mechanic Faye Hadley. The series focused on testing myths and urban legends about automobiles.

Also in 2021, excerpts of the original seasons (2003-2016) were used to produce &quot;Mythbusters: There&#x27;s Your Problem!&quot; for several streaming services. In this repackaging, each episode is summarized to include only the episode&#x27;s experiments and conclusions.

The term &quot;MythBusters&quot; may be used to refer to both the program and the cast members who test the experiments.

== History ==
The series concept was developed for the Discovery Channel as &quot;Tall Tales or True&quot; by Australian writer and producer Peter Rees of Beyond Productions in 2002. Discovery rejected the proposal initially because they had just commissioned a series on the same topic. Rees refined the pitch to focus on testing key elements of the stories rather than just retelling them. Discovery agreed to develop and co-produce a three-episode series pilot.

Jamie Hyneman was one of a number of special-effects artists who were asked to prepare a casting video for network consideration. Rees had interviewed him previously for a segment of the popular science series &quot;Beyond 2000&quot; about the British–American robot combat television series &quot;Robot Wars&quot;. Adam Savage, who had worked with Hyneman in commercials and on the robot combat television series &quot;BattleBots&quot;, was asked by Hyneman to help co-host the show because, according to Savage, Hyneman thought himself too uninteresting to host the series on his own.

During July 2006, an edited 30-minute version of &quot;MythBusters&quot; began airing on BBC Two in the UK. The episodes shown on the European Discovery Channel sometimes include extra scenes not shown in the United States version. Some of these scenes are included in &quot;specials&quot;, such as &quot;MythBusters Outtakes&quot;.

The 14th season, which premiered in January 2016, was the final season for the series with Savage and Hyneman.

Adam Savage returned to TV with the show &quot;MythBusters Jr.&quot;, without his original co-host Jamie Hyneman, but with a cast of teenagers, hence the name. The show debuted on the Science Channel on January 2, 2019 with rebroadcasts every Saturday morning on Discovery, as well as international broadcasts.

== Cast ==
Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman are the original MythBusters, and initially explored all the myths of the series using their combined experience with special effects. The two worked at Hyneman&#x27;s effects workshop, M5 Industries. They made use of his staff, who often worked off-screen, with Hyneman and Savage usually shown doing most of the work at the shop. The show is narrated by Robert Lee, though in some regions, his voice is replaced by a local narrator.
As the series progressed, members of Hyneman&#x27;s staff were introduced and began to appear regularly in episodes. Three such members, artist Kari Byron, builder Tory Belleci, and metal-worker Scottie Chapman, were organized as a second team of MythBusters during the second season, dubbed the &quot;Build Team&quot;. After Chapman left the show during the third season, Grant Imahara, a colleague of Hyneman&#x27;s, was hired to provide the team with his electrical and robotics experience. Byron went on maternity leave in mid-2009, with her position on the Build Team temporarily filled by Jessi Combs, best known for co-hosting Spike&#x27;s &quot;Xtreme 4x4&quot;.

Byron returned in the third episode of 2010 season. The Build Team worked at its own workshop, called M7, investigating separate myths from the original duo. Each episode typically alternated between the two teams covering different myths. During the Build Team&#x27;s tenure, Belleci was the only member to appear in every myth that the team tested. At the end of the 2014 season finale &quot;Plane Boarding&quot;, Savage and Hyneman announced that Byron, Belleci, and Imahara would not be returning in the 2015 season. This was reportedly over salary negotiations due to the rising cost of five hosts. Hyneman and Savage returned to being the sole hosts. Byron, Belleci, and Imahara went on to host Netflix&#x27;s &quot;White Rabbit Project&quot;.

The series had two interns, dubbed &quot;Mythterns&quot;: Discovery Channel contest winner Christine Chamberlain and viewer building contest-winner Jess Nelson. During the first season, the program featured segments with folklorist Heather Joseph-Witham, who explained the origins of certain myths, and other people who had first-hand experience with the myths being tested, but those elements were phased out early in the series.

The MythBusters commonly consulted experts for myths or topics for which they needed assistance. These topics included firearms, for which they mostly consulted Lt. Al Normandy of the South San Francisco Police Department, and explosives, for which they consulted retired FBI explosives expert Frank Doyle and Sgt. J.D. Nelson of the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office. The MythBusters often asked other people, such as those supplying the equipment being tested, what they knew about the myth under investigation. When guests were on the show, the MythBusters generally consulted them or included them in the experiments.

== Episodes ==

No consistent system was used for organizing &quot;MythBusters&quot; episodes into seasons. The program has never followed a typical calendar of on- and off-air periods. The official &quot;MythBusters&quot; website lists episodes by year. Discovery sells DVD sets for &quot;seasons&quot;, which sometimes follow the calendar year and sometimes do not. Discovery and retail stores sell &quot;collections&quot; which divide up the episodes in a different way. Each collection has about 10 or 12 episodes from various seasons.

The following table is organized according to year of first broadcast.

== Format ==
Each &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode focuses typically on two or more popular beliefs, Internet rumors, or other myths. Many of the myths are on mechanical effects as portrayed in live-action films and television of fictional incidents. The list of myths tested by the series is compiled from many sources, including the personal experiences of cast and crew, as well as fan suggestions, such as those posted on the Discovery Channel online MythBusters forums.

Occasionally, episodes are produced in which some or all of the myths are related by theme, such as pirates or sharks, and occasionally these are dubbed as &quot;[Theme] Special&quot; episodes. As of May 2009, four myths have required such extensive preparation and testing that they had entire episodes devoted solely to them, and four specials have been double-length. Several episodes, including the 2006 Holiday Special, have included the building of Rube Goldberg machines. Before a myth is introduced by the hosts, a myth-related drawing is made on a blueprint. After the hosts introduce the myth, a comical video explaining the myth is usually shown.

=== Experiment approach ===
The MythBusters typically test myths in a two-step process. In early episodes, the steps were described as &quot;replicate the circumstances, then duplicate the results&quot; by Savage. This means that first the team attempts to recreate the circumstances that the myth alleges, to determine whether the alleged result occurs. If that fails, they attempt to expand the circumstances to the point that will cause the described result, which often reveals that the claims of the myth are objectively ridiculous or impossible to achieve without specialized training or equipment. Occasionally, the team, usually Savage and Hyneman, holds a friendly competition between themselves to see which of them can devise a more successful solution to recreating the results. This is most common with myths involving building an object that can accomplish a goal. For example, rapidly cooling a beer, or finding a needle in a haystack.

While the team obeys no specific formula in terms of physical procedure, most myths involve construction of various objects to help test the myth. They use their functional workshops to construct whatever is needed, often including mechanical devices and sets to simulate the circumstances of the myth. Human actions are often simulated by mechanical means to increase safety, and to achieve consistency in repeated actions. Methods for testing myths are usually planned and executed in a manner to produce visually dramatic results, which generally involves explosions, fires, or vehicle crashes. Thus, myths or tests involving explosives, firearms and vehicle collisions are relatively common.

Results are measured in a manner scientifically appropriate for the given experiment. Sometimes, results can be measured by simple numerical measurement using standard tools, such as multimeters for electrical measurements, or various types of thermometers to measure temperature. To gauge results that do not yield numerical quantities, the teams commonly make use of several types of equipment that can provide other forms of observable effects. When testing physical consequences to a human body, which would be too dangerous to test on a living person, the MythBusters commonly use analogues.

Early episodes made heavy use of crash-test dummies for observing blunt trauma injury, and ballistic gelatin for testing penetrating trauma; whatever form and function it possessed, the dummy would always be named Buster The crew progressed to using pig carcasses when an experiment required a more accurate simulation of human flesh, bone, and organs. Occasionally real or simulated bones were molded within ballistics gel for simulations of specific body parts. Synthetic cadavers, or SynDavers, were used in a few tests such as in the &quot;Car Cushion&quot; myth.

Both for the purposes of visual observation to determine a result and simply as a unique visual for the program, high-speed cameras are used during experiments and have become a trademark of the series. Very fast footage of moving objects in front of a measured scale is commonly used to determine the speed of the object.

Testing is often edited due to time constraints of a televised episode. It can often seem as if the teams draw results from fewer repetitions and a smaller data set than they actually have. During the &quot;Outtakes Special&quot;, they specifically stated that while they are, in fact, very thorough in testing myths and repeat experiments many times in many different configurations, it is simply impossible to display the entire process during a program. Beginning in the fifth season, episodes typically contain a prompt for the viewer to visit the show&#x27;s homepage to view outtake footage of either additional testing or other facets of the myths being tested. However, Savage himself has acknowledged that they do not purport always to achieve a satisfactorily large enough set of results to overcome definitively all bias. In response to criticisms they receive about their methods and results in previous episodes, the staff produced several &quot;Myths Revisited&quot; episodes in which the teams retest myths to see if the complaints have merit. These episodes have sometimes resulted in overturning results of several myths, as well as upholding some results for reasons different from the original.

Occasionally, the MythBusters take the opportunity to test &quot;mini-myths&quot; during the course of one of the episode&#x27;s main myths, usually in the name of satisfying personal curiosity. These can either be planned in advance to take advantage of the testing location—for instance, in the &quot;Peeing on the Third Rail&quot; myth Adam got permission to find out if placing coins on a train track was sufficient to derail a train (he found that the test locomotive was not affected at all)—or can simply take place without prior planning.

==Rejected myths==
MythBusters refuse to test some myths. Paranormal concepts, such as aliens or ghosts, are not addressed because they cannot be tested by scientific methods, although one exception, pyramid power, prompted Adam to comment, &quot;No more &#x27;oogie-boogie&#x27; myths, please&quot; and state at a tour show in Indianapolis in 2012 that it was a mistake. Another myth related to the paranormal was the &quot;Haunted Hum&quot; myth, which involved testing if a particular, inaudible sound frequency can lead people to believe that an area is haunted.

The program generally avoided experiments harmful to live animals, though in one episode, they bombarded cockroaches and other laboratory insects with lethal doses of radiation. The cast addressed this, saying that the insects were specifically bred for experiments, and would have likely died anyway. However, animal carcasses, including those of pigs and chickens, were often used, but the MythBusters repeatedly emphasized that the animals died of natural causes.

The book &quot;MythBusters: The Explosive Truth Behind 30 of the Most Perplexing Urban Legends of All Time&quot; () gives a list of a dozen myths that are unlikely to be explored, although four were eventually tested. Savage commented that testing myths that require them to disprove general claims is difficult because of the inherent difficulty in disproving a negative. As a result, when they pursued such myths, they typically went about disproving specific methods that claim to achieve results.

Certain myths are not tested due to various objections by Discovery Channel or their advertisers, most notably myths pertaining to radio-frequency identification vulnerability. Through nine seasons, a total of 2,391 experiments were performed and 12 tons of explosives were used to test 769 myths. The team expressed reluctance to test conspiracy theory myths, such as the JFK assassination or 9/11 conspiracies, although they have tested some of the conspiracy theories relating to the &quot;Apollo&quot; Moon landings.

=== Outcomes of the experiments ===

By the end of each episode, the myths are rated &quot;busted&quot;, &quot;plausible&quot;, or &quot;confirmed&quot;.

==== Busted ====
Myths are rated as &quot;busted&quot; when the myth&#x27;s results cannot be replicated under either the described parameters or reasonably exaggerated ones. Often, when a myth is declared busted, the team will attempt to see what would be required to replicate the result of the myth through scientific means, discarding the original parameters of the myth itself. Going to absolute limits of what is physically possible to replicate the results is the origin of what is unofficially titled the &quot;Mythbusters&quot; motto, &quot;If it&#x27;s worth doing, it&#x27;s worth &quot;over&quot;doing.&quot;

This is commonly referred to in the series as &quot;the MythBusters way&quot;, and often reveals that the circumstances required to accurately recreate a &#x27;busted&#x27; myth are physically impossible or highly unlikely to occur with the scientific facts presented, or the equipment used in the myth used to gain the results is neither available to the general public, nor capable of producing the results. For example, when trying to see if diamonds can be made with a microwave, and the myth is busted, the team arranges with an expert to have diamonds created with a large quantity of explosives.

Some of these myths are retested if the viewers are dissatisfied with the results, and are declared &quot;rebusted&quot; if the results of this second attempt result in the same conclusions as the original attempts. On rare occasions, retested myths result in a conclusion different from the first attempt, usually going from &quot;busted&quot; the first time, to &quot;plausible&quot; or even &quot;confirmed&quot; on the retest.

==== Plausible ====
Plausible is given under a few circumstances:
*The myth&#x27;s results can only be replicated by expanding some parameters of the myth by a realistic and reasonable margin. This may have been because of the myth having been altered slightly over time by it being told and retold by the time it was tested by the MythBusters. Also, certain materials may have had to be substituted for others in some cases as a matter of necessity during the course of the myth being tested, but the new materials are almost always very similar to the materials specified and usually are readily available, so as to prevent it from being prohibitively costly or impractical.
*Plausible is given if no documentation of the myth occurred at the time of the episode&#x27;s production, yet the MythBusters were still able to duplicate it very closely as to how the myth was described (such as the myth that pirates wore eye patches to keep their night vision, or an untrained pilot was talked through landing an airplane).
*If the myth&#x27;s results are achieved using the method described, but the underlying reason is different from the one described in the myth (such as in the myth of throwing a fire extinguisher into a fire to make it explode and extinguish the fire)
*If it requires a highly improbable set of circumstances, yet is shown to be possible under similar yet artificial circumstances, plausible is used. For example, in the myth of &quot;Can two colliding bullets fuse together?&quot;, two bullets were shown to fuse together, but would be exceedingly difficult to actually get two period guns with period ammunition to collide in the correct way to cause the result. The results can be created in a similar laboratory setting, but the chances of the myth actually happening as described are remote.
*If the results stated in the myth are attainable, but in such a way as to make the process either highly dangerous or less efficient than more common methods of achieving the same result, it is used. For example, in &quot;Car vs. Rain&quot;, the MythBusters declared the myth &quot;plausible (but not recommended)&quot;, due to the danger in driving a car at high speeds on a wet road, though the myth was completely true.
*Plausible is used if a positive result is attained using surrogates for living creatures, but the procedure would result in injury or death if an actual creature was tested. For example, in &quot;Holiday Special&quot;, two ballistics-gel replicas of pet dogs were used to test the myth that a falling frozen turkey would crush a household pet; both replicas sustained serious injuries, as determined by a veterinarian, and the myth was dubbed &quot;plausible&quot;, as the Build Team was unwilling to test the myth on actual pets.
*Occasionally, a myth is labelled plausible if the described scenario produces a result similar to, but of less intensity than, the one described in the myth.

==== Confirmed ====
The term &quot;true&quot; was used instead of &quot;confirmed&quot; in the first season.
* The MythBusters are able to re-create or closely re-create the myth&#x27;s purported outcome with the described circumstances. A &quot;confirmed&quot; myth is usually corroborated with documented evidence of actual occurrences.
* If the myth lacks any specific scenarios, the MythBusters test every reasonable scenario, and just one scenario is enough for them to confirm the myth. For example, when testing to see whether shooting fish in a barrel was in fact very easy, in most tests, they could not hit the fish with a bullet, but the energy transfer to the water by the bullet was lethal to the fish; therefore, the myth was confirmed.
* If no instances of the event are documented as occurring in real life, but the myth was taken from a specific scene or character in a specific movie, the myth is confirmed if they are able to replicate it with the same circumstances. For example, the Build Team gave a verdict of &quot;confirmed&quot; for a scene in &quot;Point Break&quot; where two skydivers—one without a parachute—jumped off the plane at different times, and yet the second jumper was able to catch up to the first jumper. Though no cases of this ever being attempted in real life were documented, it was confirmed nonetheless, since it only came from a single scene in a specific movie. The same applied to the myth about the Knight Rider driving his car at highway speeds into a semi-trailer truck via ramp, without any trouble; though Adam and Jamie found no real-life occurrences of the stunt other than movie or television productions, it came from a specific TV show, and thus was confirmed.
* In rare circumstances, a myth is considered confirmed when the testing process is intentionally stopped but news reports or other documentation are available that confirm it &quot;has&quot; happened at least once; in testing the Jet Taxi Myth (in which a taxicab is flipped by the engine of a jet aircraft), both Adam and Jamie agreed that the myth could not be replicated accurately for insurance reasons, but news footage verified that such an event is possible. (In this case, three years later, they were allowed to return to the subject and confirm the myth using a Boeing 747.)

== Warnings and self-censorship ==
Many of the myths tested involve purported household scenarios, so all episodes begin with a disclaimer against attempting the experiments seen on the series; most episodes also feature a second warning halfway through the running time. These disclaimers are not broadcast on SBS in Australia, in the Netherlands, Discovery Mix in Sweden, Samsung TV plus MythBusters channel in the United Kingdom, Select DVDs in the United States, the Discovery Channel in Denmark, or on the Prime and Sky Discovery Channels in New Zealand. Often, they are presented with an element of humor, such as Savage wearing a padded suit as Hyneman hits him in the chest with a baseball bat, or Hyneman explaining that Savage and he are professionals before Savage slides into view and crashes into a barrier, while saying, &quot;Don&#x27;t try this at home!&quot;

The series employs various degrees of safety- or courtesy-related censorship. Vulgar language is censored, as the show is considered family-friendly, and most such language occurs spontaneously when the team is surprised or overexcited; at other times, a deliberate effort is made to keep the scripted material clean. In addition to the standard bleep, the show often uses a relevant or humorous sound effect. Euphemisms and scientific terminology are used for potentially offensive terms.

In the &quot;Peeing on the Third Rail&quot; myth, the show censored the valve used to release urine from the dummy. The names of ingredients used in the production of hazardous materials and some explosives are usually censored to prevent amateurs from recreating potentially dangerous substances. For example, in the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; special, Savage ignited thermite with a hypergolic mixture of &quot;blur&quot; (a syrupy, pale blue liquid) and &quot;blur&quot; (a dark powder). In a Civil War–themed episode, the ingredients for making a form of homemade black powder were censored in similar fashion.

In one extreme instance of self-censorship, the team explored an urban legend stating that a widely available material could be used to create an explosive. To their surprise, the seemingly unlikely legend proved true, but the material was so easy to obtain, and the resulting explosion so powerful, that the production team decided allowing such information to reach the general public would be irresponsible, instead electing to destroy all footage of the experiment and agreeing never to speak of the incident. Several years later, when DARPA solicited advice from the public regarding potentially unknown bomb risks, Savage contacted them about their discovery.

In another episode that focused on myths surrounding electronic security devices, a segment was aired on defeating biometric fingerprint readers using various methods. One of these techniques involved creating a fake 3D fingerprint from a 2D image of the authorized print. After some trial and error, the team successfully cast a viable ballistics gel reproduction using a copper-coated printed circuit board, a picture of the fingerprint printed on acetate, and a photochemical acid etching process.

After the reproduction was shown to defeat both fingerprint scanners, and although the chemicals used during the etching process are never identified, the narrator still hints at an important step having been edited out and discourages viewers from trying it themselves. None of the other techniques that successfully defeated the fingerprint scanners or the other security devices tested in the episode were censored or obfuscated, perhaps because the rest were all fairly simple and straightforward methods, such as holding up a bedsheet or moving extremely slowly to hide from ultrasonic motion detectors or holding up a pane of glass to defeat thermal motion detectors.

Brand names and logos are regularly blurred or covered with tape or a &quot;MythBusters&quot; sticker. Brand names are shown when integral to a myth, such as in the Diet Coke and Mentos experiment or Pop Rocks in the first pilot episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot;.

The Diet Coke and Mentos experiment is also an outlier regarding their safety warnings, as Savage and Hyneman stated on-air that this myth was perfectly safe for viewers to replicate on their own. Another example of this is the &quot;Phone Book Friction&quot; episode, in which they investigated the difficulty of pulling two telephone books apart after their pages had been interleaved. One episode from the 2014 season, &quot;&quot;DO&quot; Try This at Home?&quot;, classified several myths as safe or unsafe for testing by viewers.

== Accidents ==
Owing to the nature of the experiments performed on the show, many did not go as expected. Sometimes, these mishaps rendered the test equipment unusable, such as when the rocket in the &quot;Rocket Car Revisit&quot; episode exploded on ignition. Others even resulted in minor injuries to the personnel involved with the show, such as when Belleci banged his knee falling off a fire tower; the fall was expected and prepared for using a safety harness, but the injury to his knee was unforeseen. The most common injuries were caused when moving safety equipment, which resulted in stitches and at least four broken fingers. These kinds of incidents were usually included in the broadcast program, with little other media attention, but some things failed in more spectacular and newsworthy ways.

=== Esparto accident ===
On March 20, 2009, the town of Esparto, California, was shaken and windows were shattered by a blast created by of ANFO during filming of the myth &quot;Knock Your Socks Off&quot;. Some residents were upset that the blast took place without &quot;telling anyone&quot;. Chief Barry Burns of the Esparto Fire Department had several firefighters present for the explosion. He said he made the decision not to notify anyone in town for safety&#x27;s sake. &quot;&quot;MythBusters&quot; is supposed to be a really popular show. Everybody would have been out there. We would have had to cancel it because it would have been too dangerous.&quot; Representatives from the show replaced some of the windows that same day. The experiment did air, but the hosts recounted in a 2011 special episode (&quot;Location, Location, Location&quot;) that they have never returned to the Esparto quarry as a result of the mishap.

=== Cannonball accident ===
On December 6, 2011, while conducting the &quot;Cannonball Chemistry&quot; experiment, the MythBusters crew accidentally sent a cannonball through the side of a house and into a minivan in a Dublin, California, neighborhood. Although the experiment was being carried out at the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Bomb Range under the supervision of the Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, the errant projectile went over its intended target of water barrels and instead skipped up a hill that was intended as a secondary safety target. The cannonball soared into a neighboring community, striking a house and leaving a hole, before striking the roof of another house and smashing through a window of a parked minivan. No one was hurt by the rogue cannonball.

A show producer visited the homeowners to apologize, followed by Savage and Hyneman; Savage later stated that the incident would not cause the series production to be suspended. Savage and Kari Byron returned to Dublin High School on February 22, 2012, to participate in a moderated panel session at Dublin High School&#x27;s Engineering and Design Academy Open House during National Engineers Week 2012, in part to help repair relations with the community. The sold-out event attracted over 1,000 attendees.

During the airing of the experiment on November 11, 2012, the Build Team apologized for the accident and explained that they suspended testing after it occurred to assess damage and start an investigation. The testing resumed several months later at a rock quarry in a much more remote area.

== Name lawsuit ==
In January 2005, children&#x27;s author and adventurer Andrew Knight commenced legal proceedings in Australia against Beyond Productions, the producer of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, alleging passing off in relation to the use of the name &quot;MythBusters&quot;. Knight asserted that he had previously organized a team of &quot;MythBusters&quot; and had used the name continuously since 1988 in relation to pursuing myths, ghosts, monsters, goblins, and other such mysteries in an offbeat manner around the world. Knight wrote a series of self-published children&#x27;s books under the banner &quot;MythBusters&quot; in 1991, 1993, and 1996.

In February 2007, the Federal Court of Australia dismissed Knight&#x27;s claims against Beyond Productions. A parallel action, relying on the same three books and a collection of short television appearances, was brought later that year in the Chancery Division of the High Court of England and Wales. Beyond Properties Pty Limited was again a defendant, as were two other Beyond companies and Discovery Communications Inc, the entity responsible for broadcasting the &quot;MythBusters&quot; program in the UK. These claims were also dismissed.

== Popularity and influence ==

Hyneman and Savage have appeared on numerous entertainment programs, such as &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, NPR&#x27;s news program &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, the syndicated radio &quot;Bob and Tom Show&quot;, and in the movie &quot;The Darwin Awards&quot; (as two military surplus vendors who sold a JATO rocket to the main character). &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine&#x27;s Daniel Loxton interviewed the duo in a 2005 article titled &quot;MythBusters Exposed&quot;. Hyneman and Savage spoke at the annual convention of the National Science Teachers Association in March 2006, and the California Science Teachers Association named them honorary lifetime members in October 2006. In 2009, they were the featured keynote speakers at RSA Conference. They also are occasionally interviewed for articles by &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; and are featured in that magazine&#x27;s September 2009 issue.

Hyneman and Savage occasionally appear at colleges around the United States to talk about what it is like to be a MythBuster; the show consists of an interview and discussion to give the audience the opportunity to ask the MythBusters questions. The Build Team members have sometimes made appearances in similar capacity. They hold lectures in both collegiate and corporate settings, though the technical colleges tend to be the most enthusiastic. They have spoken at WPI, RPI, MIT, Michigan Tech, UC Berkeley and many others.

Adam Savage has written a primer on mold-making for &quot;Make&quot; magazine, and has been featured guest at the San Mateo Maker Faire since 2008. Kari Byron was interviewed on &quot;The Late Show&quot;, on January 16, 2006.

People involved in survival stories reported in local newscasts have sometimes mentioned previous viewings of &quot;MythBusters&quot; as an influence to their actions. Twenty-three-year-old Theresa Booth of St. Martin, Minnesota, credits a &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode for her infant child and her survival. On April 3, 2007, she skidded off the road into a drainage ditch, which had filled with flood water from the Sauk River. Unable to open the door, Booth recalled the &quot;Underwater Car&quot; myth and waited until the pressure equalized to open the door. On October 19, 2007, in Sydney, Australia, a teenager named Julian Shaw pulled a fainted middle-aged man off the railway tracks near a train station to safety below the platform. He pulled back as the train passed, citing that the &quot;Train Suction&quot; episode affected his response.

The 3rd Annual Independent Investigative Group IIG Awards presented an award to &quot;MythBusters&quot; recognizing the promotion of science and critical thinking in popular media on May 18, 2009.

On the May 1, 2008, episode of &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Hyneman and Savage appeared in a cameo as observers taking notes during a test to determine whether a stun-gun bolt can set someone on fire under various circumstances (which was later tested on &quot;MythBusters&quot; itself).

During August 2008, Hyneman and Savage appeared on the stage of NVISION 08, an event sponsored by Nvidia, having been asked by Nvidia&#x27;s creative director, David Wright, to provide a visual demonstration of the power of the graphics processing unit vs a central processing unit. They did this by creating an image of the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; with a giant parallel processing paintball gun, setting a world record for largest paintball gun in the process. An encore of the demonstration was given at YouTube Live featuring Hyneman standing in the path of the paintballs wearing a suit of armor.

On the April 17, 2012, episode of &quot;NCIS&quot;, &quot;Rekindled&quot;, the character Abby Sciuto demonstrates a thermite fire to her boss, Jethro Gibbs, by playing a clip from the &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode &quot;End with a Bang&quot;. Gibbs asks if the men in the clip are pyromaniacs, and she replies, &quot;Scientists, Gibbs! Okay, yeah, they&#x27;re kind of pyromaniacs too&quot;.

Hyneman, Savage, and others from the &quot;MythBusters&quot; crew have appeared at The Amaz!ng Meeting, and subsequently were interviewed by Steven Novella and the &quot;skeptical rogues&quot; for the podcast The Skeptics&#x27; Guide to the Universe. On April 16, 2010, Hyneman and Savage received the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award in Cultural Humanism from the Harvard Humanist Chaplaincy.
On October 18, 2010, President Barack Obama, as part of the White House Science Fair, announced he had taped a segment of &quot;MythBusters&quot; and would appear on December 8, 2010. Obama&#x27;s segment covered the Archimedes solar ray myth.

Both men appeared at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, in Washington, DC. They had an experiment with the crowd involving the wave. They had the audience make various noises (e.g. popping their cheeks or laughing) all at the same time. They also had everyone in the crowd jump up at the same time to see if it would register on a seismograph.

Hyneman and Savage received honorary doctorates from the University of Twente in the Netherlands for their role in popularizing science, on the occasion of the university&#x27;s 50th anniversary, on November 25, 2011.

As of November 2011, all five MythBusters have also appeared in new shows, segments or specials for Discovery&#x27;s Science Channel, including &quot;Head Rush&quot; (Byron, 2010–present); &quot;Punkin Chunkin 2010&quot; (Hyneman and Savage); &quot;Flying Anvils 2011&quot; (Belleci); &quot;Road to Punkin Chunkin 2011&quot; and &quot;Punkin Chunkin 2011&quot; (Belleci, Byron and Imahara); &quot;Large Dangerous Rocket Ships 2010 and Large Dangerous Rocket Ships 2011&quot; (Byron); &quot;Killer Robots: RoboGames 2010&quot; (Imahara); &quot;Curiosity&quot; (Savage); &quot;Punkin Chunkin 2012&quot; (Belleci, Byron and Imahara). Savage and Hyneman are judges on the game show &quot;Unchained Reaction&quot; which premiered in March 2012. Belleci and Byron are also hosts of the 2015 Science Channel show &quot;Thrill Factor&quot;.

Aired on February 12, 2012, Hyneman and Savage lent their voices to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot; to be featured on a show similar to &quot;MythBusters &quot;called &quot;Mythcrackers&quot; in which Hyneman and Savage take on the classic myth that a cat always lands on its feet. In the episode, they do not want to harm a real cat, so they took a Build A Bear carcass, stuffed it with ballistics gel, shot it with a 20-foot barrel steam cannon, then made a scatter plot of the remains. By the end of the experiment, Hyneman asked, &quot;What was it we were trying to prove again?&quot;, to which Savage replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t know, don&#x27;t care.&quot; Clips from this show appeared in the &quot;MythBusters&quot;&#x27; &quot;Simpsons&quot; Special that first aired in 2015.

On October 3, 2012, Byron and Belleci made a guest appearance on the Discovery series &quot;Sons of Guns&quot;. They test-fired some of the weapons in the Red Jacket shop, then watched as the staff retested a myth busted by the Build Team in 2008, that a propane tank could explode when hit with a bullet.
In 2015, Hyneman and Savage appeared in a series of Australian television commercials for Dulux paint, depicting them testing the maker&#x27;s claims of durability.

In 2016, a &quot;New York Times&quot; study of the 50 television shows with the most Facebook likes found that &quot;MythBusters&quot; &quot;has the second-highest share of &#x27;likes&#x27; from men of any show in the data, after &quot;Fast N&#x27; Loud&quot;&quot;.

=== Tours and exhibits ===
A traveling museum exhibit called &quot;MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition&quot; was developed over the course of about five years, premiering at the Museum of Science and Industry, Chicago, in March 2012.

In 2011, Savage and Hyneman created a live stage show called the &quot;MythBusters Behind the Myths&quot; Tour, in which they conduct experiments on-stage and discuss some background details of the show.

In March 2014, they announced that the tour would be coming to Australia and New Zealand.

The show and one particular episode (involving the myth of a cigarette being able to cause a fire when thrown into a pool of gasoline) was credited with helping to free a man from prison.

== International broadcasts ==
&quot;MythBusters&quot; is broadcast in several countries, primarily by each country&#x27;s version of the Discovery Channel. In some countries, the English speech is either subtitled in the relevant language, or the narration voice-over is replaced, or the entire show (narration and hosts&#x27; voices) is dubbed. The United States customary units, used by the hosts throughout the show, are converted to metric in the process. In the UK since 2011, the use of US customary units in the show has often been retained, rather than being replaced with metric units. Sometimes, the part where the myth is explained in sketches is completely redrawn in that language. Excerpts of the show were also shown as part of the Beyond Television–produced &quot;Beyond Tomorrow,&quot; re-voiced by Matt Shirvington. It also shows in Hong Kong&#x27;s ViuTVsix.

== Revival and spin-offs ==

In late March 2016, &quot;Variety&quot; revealed that Discovery&#x27;s sister network Science Channel was planning to produce a revival of &quot;MythBusters&quot; with a new cast, and that its hosts would be determined by a reality competition spin-off, &quot;Search for the Next MythBusters&quot; (later renamed &quot;&quot;), which was hosted by Nerdist&#x27;s Kyle Hill. The revival, hosted by Brian Louden and Jon Lung, would premiere its first, 14-episode season on November 15, 2017.

In September 2016, Beyond announced it was producing a new original series for Netflix, &quot;White Rabbit Project&quot;, starring Byron, Belleci, and Imahara. It ran for one season of 10 episodes.

In April 2018, Adam Savage was announced to be returning to the franchise to host and executive produce a new spin-off, &quot;MythBusters Jr.&quot;, with a 10-episode first season, which premiered in December 2018 with a sneak-peek episode, and the series officially starting January 2, 2019. The series features Savage working with a group of six young scientists. Savage stated that his goal for the series was to &quot;start passing on everything to the next generation&quot; as he grows older.

In 2021, an automotive-focused spin-off was produced called &quot;Motor MythBusters&quot;, with original Build Team member Tory Belleci being joined by Faye Hadley of the &quot;All Girls Garage&quot; series and professional race car driver Bisi Ezerioha. Robert Lee once again provided some voice over work for this series. The 13-episode series, which premiered on August 4, 2021, was initially only available on the Motor Trend app in the United States, before being released through Amazon Prime Video, and having its premiere on Motor Trend&#x27;s TV channel on January 18, 2022. In 2021 Beyond also repackaged segments from the original series grouped into themed episodes to create a spin-off called &quot;MythBusters: There&#x27;s Your Problem&quot;.

Savage has stated that he is unlikely to work with Hyneman on any future projects, stating that although they worked well together as a classic example of a double act (with Hyneman as the straight man), their personalities clashed off-screen and on-screen. Savage suspected that both he and Hyneman were enjoying spending time apart from each other.

<doc id="627305" wikidata="Q3182997" url="?curid=627305" title="Johnny and the Bomb">
<text>Johnny and the Bomb is a 1996 novel by Terry Pratchett. It is the third novel to feature Johnny Maxwell and his friends, and deals with the rules and consequences of time travel. The first two novels in the &quot;Johnny Maxwell Trilogy&quot; are &quot;Only You Can Save Mankind&quot; (1992) and &quot;Johnny and the Dead&quot; (1993).

The action of the novel revolves around an incident during World War II in which Johnny&#x27;s inoffensive home town of Blackbury was hit by a bomb during an air raid intended for an industrial complex at another nearby town. It is this bomb, and not nuclear weapons, to which the title refers.

==Plot summary==
After Johnny Maxwell, a boy in his early teens, finds Mrs. Tachyon, an old bag lady, by a cinema he discovers that her trolley is in fact a time machine. He goes back to his town, Blackbury, during the time of The Blitz with his friends Stephen (aka Wobbler), Bigmac, Kirsty and Yo-less (possibly because Johnny has been obsessing about the destruction of Paradise Street in a German raid). Wobbler gets left behind in 1941, and when they return for him, Johnny tries to prevent the deaths caused in the raid.

==Characters==

Johnny Maxwell – Johnny is the protagonist.

Stephen &#x27;Wobbler&#x27; Johnson – (Walter in the TV series) Johnny&#x27;s best friend and the second main character in the book. He is overweight and heavily into computers, an expert at piracy. He wants to be a &quot;nerd&quot;, but they would not let him join. It is his considered opinion that Johnny is mental. His real name is Stephen Johnson. In &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot;, Wobbler gets stuck in 1941 and grows up to be a billionaire calling himself Sir John and Bigmac is locked up in the Tower of London as a Nazi spy, but, due to the time travel and multiple timelines involved, where and if this happens is questionable. Wobbler returns successfully from 1941 and Bigmac is free from the Tower of London.

Simon &#x27;Bigmac&#x27; Wrigley – An asthmatic skinhead who is deeply embarrassed by his interest in maths. He lives with his brother in a rundown tower block on the edge of Blackbury. He is not exactly a criminal but has a confused grasp of car ownership.
Yo-less – A West Indian boy, nicknamed by Johnny because he does not say &quot;Yo!&quot; His interests include Star Trek, train spotting, Morris dancing, and brass band music. His reaction to those who are surprised a black kid has such &quot;uncool&quot; hobbies varies from amusement to irritation. When faced with genuine racism he has a brittle anger that manifests itself in cold, almost emotionlessly delivered sarcasm.

Kirsty – Unlike the rest of the gang, Kirsty is a highly organised person who knows exactly where she wants to go in life. She is highly intelligent but has very poor people skills, something she views as a character flaw in everyone else. She is trying to get Johnny&#x27;s life organised since he is clearly incapable of doing it himself, but has not realised that he does not especially want his life organised. He finds her very easy to talk to since she never listens. She is the only female member of the gang.

==Reception==
The book received positive reviews. Kirkus Reviews called the book &quot;Complex, funny and, above all, impassioned.&quot; School Library Journal praised the plot and humor of the novel. A reviewer for Horn Book Magazine wrote: &quot;With plenty of loopy logic, off-the-cuff philosophy, and hectic action, this trilogy cap-off is pure fun.&quot;

==Television series==
In January 2006 the BBC aired a three-part television adaptation of &quot;Johnny and the Bomb&quot;, starring George MacKay, Zoë Wanamaker, Frank Finlay and Keith Barron.

===Differences between book and TV series===
In the book, Johnny changes history so that no-one dies in the Paradise Street bombing. However, the TV series has this as the original history, which the gang inadvertently changes on their first visit to the past. In the history thus created, Simon was jailed in the Tower of London for being a Nazi spy though he is later released; Johnny&#x27;s grandmother was killed, meaning he no longer exists. When Johnny faces his own grandfather, he mistakes him for an intruder. She is then saved due to the alarm going off and Johnny exists again.

A smaller change is that in the series, Stephen (Wobbler) is renamed Walter, later Sir Walter.

<text>The Piano Sonata No. 2, &quot;Concord, Mass., 1840–60 (commonly known as the Concord Sonata&quot;) is a piano sonata by Charles Ives. It is one of the composer&#x27;s best-known and most highly regarded pieces. A typical performance of the piece lasts around 45 minutes.

==History==

Some material in the &quot;Concord Sonata&quot; dates back as far as 1904, but Ives did not begin substantial work on it until around 1909 and largely completed the sonata by 1915. The &quot;Concord Sonata&quot; was first published in 1920 with a second, revised, edition appearing in 1947. It is this version which is usually performed today. In 2012, a reprint of the original, uncorrected 1920 edition was published, including &quot;Essays before a Sonata&quot; and with an added introductory essay by the New England Conservatory&#x27;s Stephen Drury.

Ives recalled performing parts of the (then incomplete) sonata as early as 1912. However, the earliest known public performances of the sonata following its publication date back to October 1920, when author Henry Bellamann, who had been writing and lecturing about new music, persuaded a pianist named Lenore Purcell to tackle the work. According to Henry and Sidney Cowell, &quot;she gave performances of it, usually one movement at a time, in conjunction with Bellamann&#x27;s lectures, across the southern states from New Orleans to Spartanburg, South Carolina.&quot; 

During the late 1920s, a number of pianists including Katherine Heyman, Clifton Furness, E. Robert Schmitz, Oscar Ziegler, Anton Rovinsky, and Arthur Hardcastle performed various movements of the sonata. In the spring of 1927, John Kirkpatrick saw the score of the sonata on Heyman&#x27;s piano in her Paris studio and was intrigued. He borrowed Heyman&#x27;s copy and soon contacted Ives to request his own copy, which he promptly received. Kirkpatrick began learning and performing individual movements of the piece and engaged in regular correspondence with Ives, and in 1934, he decided to learn the entire piece. Kirkpatrick met Ives in person for the first time in 1937, and by 1938, Kirkpatrick was playing the entire sonata, performing it for the first time at a private concert in Stamford, Connecticut. (In a letter to Ives dated June 22, 1938, Kirkpatrick wrote: &quot;Last night, in our little series here, we got to the American impressionists, and I trotted out the whole Concord Sonata — not yet from memory — but it was nice to feel its unity.&quot;) 

On November 28 of that year, Kirkpatrick performed the sonata in its entirety at a public concert in Cos Cob, Connecticut, and on January 20, 1939, he gave the sonata its New York premiere at Town Hall in New York City. Among those present was Elliott Carter, who reviewed the piece in the March–April 1939 edition of the journal &quot;Modern Music&quot;. The Cowells wrote that the premiere generated &quot;a riot of enthusiasm,&quot; and stated that &quot;the audience responded so warmly that one movement had to be repeated, and on 24 February, at a second Town Hall program that was devoted entirely to Ives, Mr. Kirkpatrick repeated the whole Sonata by popular request.&quot; Kirkpatrick proceeded to play the sonata in major cities around the United States.

==Music==

The sonata&#x27;s four movements represent figures associated with transcendentalism. In the introduction to his &quot;Essays Before a Sonata&quot; (published immediately before the &quot;Concord Sonata&quot;, and serving as what Henry and Sidney Cowell called &quot;an elaborate kind of program note (124 pages long)&quot;), Ives said the work was his &quot;impression of the spirit of transcendentalism that is associated in the minds of many with Concord, Massachusetts of over a half century ago. This is undertaken in impressionistic pictures of Emerson and Thoreau, a sketch of the Alcotts, and a scherzo supposed to reflect a lighter quality which is often found in the fantastic side of Hawthorne.&quot;

The four movements are:

The piece demonstrates Ives&#x27; experimental tendencies: much of it is written without barlines, the harmonies are advanced, and in the second movement, there are cluster chords created by depressing the piano&#x27;s keys with a piece of wood, as well as clusters marked &quot;Better played by using the palm of the hand or the clenched fist.&quot; The piece also amply demonstrates Ives&#x27; fondness for musical quotation: the opening bars of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 are quoted in each movement. James B. Sinclair&#x27;s catalogue of Ives&#x27;s works also notes less obvious quotations of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Hammerklavier Sonata&quot; as well as quotations from Debussy and Wagner. Unusually for a piano sonata, there are optional parts for other instruments: near the end of the first movement there is an optional part for viola, and in the last movement a flute (an instrument which Thoreau played) briefly appears.

In a conversation with Ives, Elliott Carter wrote:

Tom C. Owens, the editor of &quot;Selected Correspondence of Charles Ives&quot;, noted that, for Ives, the sonata was &quot;elusive and ephemeral&quot;, and wrote:

Regarding the &quot;Emerson&quot; movement, Ives wrote: &quot;I find that I do not play or feel like playing this music even now in the same way each time... Some of the passages now played have not been written out, and I do not know as I ever shall write them out as it may take away the daily pleasure of playing this music and seeing it grow and feeling that it is not finished and the hope that it never will be – I may always have the pleasure of not finishing it.&quot; In a letter to John Kirkpatrick, Harmony Ives wrote the following on behalf of her husband: &quot;it depends sometimes, on the time of day it is played heard — at sunrise that wide chord — and at sunset maybe with an overtone, towards a star. He has felt that some music, like a landscape, though fundamentally the same, may have changing colors during a cosmic horizon, and as you know the oak tree in May doesn&#x27;t always play the same tune way that it plays (shouts out) in October.&quot;
Commenting on the sections without barlines, Henry and Sidney Cowell wrote:
John Kirkpatrick compared aspects of Ives&#x27;s sonata, particularly &quot;Emerson&quot;, to Ives&#x27;s own prose writing, noting &quot;the way his sentences spin out and are a little bit reluctant to close. They qualify the thoughts and even counterqualify them. The ideas tumble in on one another, and they make a kind of magnificent soaring ascent.&quot; The &quot;prose&quot; sections of music described by the Cowells caused difficulties for Kirkpatrick, who stated that he didn&#x27;t have &quot;the kind of musical intelligence that could swim around in this kind of prose rhythm with no bar lines at all. I had to explain to myself very clearly just where all the main first beats were... so that I could act freely in respect to them.&quot; Nevertheless, Kirkpatrick maintained a certain degree of interpretational flexibility and openness in relation to Ives&#x27;s music, specifically with regard to Ives&#x27;s numerous revisions, stating &quot;In playing it I use some of the old and some of the new in varying degrees. Practically every time I take it up again, I see some of these choices in different lights, and everything changes slightly.&quot;

==Recordings and other uses==

The piece has been recorded on a number of occasions, first by John Kirkpatrick in 1945 (released on Columbia Records in 1948, and a best-seller for several months). Ives himself made a complete recording of &quot;The Alcotts&quot; and excerpts of the first two movements. (These and other recordings of Ives playing his own compositions were released by CRI in 1999 on a CD titled &quot;Ives Plays Ives&quot;.) Other exponents of the work include Nina Deutsch, Gilbert Kalish, Easley Blackwood, Pierre-Laurent Aimard, Stephen Drury, Marc-André Hamelin, Heather O&#x27;Donnell, Herbert Henck, Alan Feinberg, Richard Aaker Trythall, Phillip Bush, Roberto Szidon and most recently Jeremy Denk, Alan Mandel, James Drury, and Melinda Smashey Jones. Martin Perry plays the final edition made by John Kirkpatrick in the 1980s.

In 1986, Bruce Hornsby borrowed the opening phrase of &quot;The Alcotts&quot; movement as the introduction to his hit &quot;Every Little Kiss&quot; (as heard on the album &quot;The Way It Is&quot;). In an interview, Hornsby stated: &quot;Charles Ives was a huge favorite of mine and still is. In fact, I almost got sued: one of my first singles, &#x27;Every Little Kiss,&#x27; had an intro that was sort of an homage to Ives. I was basically paraphrasing the third movement of his Concord Sonata...&quot;

In 1996 the work, retitled &quot;A Concord Symphony&quot;, was transcribed for orchestra by Henry Brant.

Merlin Patterson transcribed the sonata for large symphonic wind ensemble.

<text>The University of Montpellier () is a public research university located in Montpellier, in south-east of France. Established in 1220, the University of Montpellier is one of the oldest universities in the world.

The university was split into three universities (the University of Montpellier 1, the University of Montpellier 2 and the Paul Valéry University Montpellier 3) for 45 years from 1970 until 2015 when it was subsequently reunified by the merger of the two former, with the latter, now named Paul Valéry University, Montpellier III remaining a separate entity.

==History==

The university is considerably older than its formal founding date, associated with a papal bull issued by Pope Nicholas IV in 1289, combining all the centuries-old schools into a university, but the first statutes were given by Conrad of Urach in 1220.

It is not known exactly when the schools of liberal arts were founded that developed into the Montpellier faculty of arts; it may be that they were a direct continuation of the Gallo-Roman schools that gathered around masters of rhetoric. The school of law was founded by Placentinus, from the school of law at Bologna, who came to Montpellier in 1160, taught there during two different periods, and died there in 1192. The faculty of law has had a long career. Professors from Montpellier were prominent in the drafting of the Napoleonic Code, the civil code by which France is still guided and a foundation for modern law codes wherever Napoleonic influence extended. The faculty of law was reorganized in 1998.

The school of medicine was founded perhaps by people trained in the Muslim Spanish medical schools as Muslim rule in parts of Spain did not end until 1492, when the Emirate of Granada fell (no reference is available for the founding of the school of medicine); it is certain that, as early as 1137, there were excellent physicians at Montpellier. It is the world&#x27;s oldest medical school still in operation. The school of medicine benefited from a policy of the Guilhem lords of Montpellier, by which any licensed physician might lecture there: with no fixed limit to the number of teachers, lectures multiplied, thus providing a great choice of teachers coming from all around the Mediterranean region (Guilhem VIII act of January 1181). The statutes given in 1220 by Cardinal Conrad von Urach, legate of Pope Honorius III, which were confirmed and extended in 1240, placed this school under the direction of the Bishop of Maguelonne, but the school enjoyed a great deal of &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy.

The school was famous for arguing in the fourteenth century that the Black Death was caused by a miasma entering the opening of the body&#x27;s pores, citing theories developed by Galen. Doctors educated at Montpellier advocated against bathing because they claimed bathing opened the body&#x27;s pores, making one more susceptible to the bubonic plague.

In 1529, after some years as an apothecary, Nostradamus entered the University of Montpellier to study for a doctorate in medicine. He was expelled shortly afterwards when it was discovered that he had been an apothecary, a &quot;manual trade&quot; expressly banned by the university statutes. The expulsion document (BIU Montpellier, Register S 2 folio 87) still exists in the faculty library. Rabelais took his medical degree at Montpellier, and his portrait hangs among the gallery of professors.

The Jardin des plantes de Montpellier, founded in 1593, is the oldest botanical garden in France. It was in this school that the biological theory of vitalism, elaborated by Barthez (1734–1806), had its origin. The French Revolution did not interrupt the existence of the faculty of medicine. The Benedictine monastery that had been converted into the bishop&#x27;s palace, was given to house the medical school in 1795. A gallery devoted to the portraits of professors since 1239 contains one of Rabelais.

The school of theology had its origins in lectures in the convents: St. Anthony of Padua, Raymundus Lullus, and the Dominican Bernard of Trilia all lectured. Two letters of King John II prove that a faculty of theology existed at Montpellier independently of the convents, in January 1350. By a Bull of 17 December 1421, Pope Martin V granted canonical institution to this faculty and united it closely with the faculty of law.

In the 16th century the local triumph of Calvinism interrupted the somewhat somnolent Catholic school of theology, which was reinstated in 1622; but the rivalries of Dominicans and Jesuits interfered seriously with the prosperity of the faculty, which disappeared at the Revolution. In better days, among Montpellier&#x27;s illustrious pupils of law were Petrarch, who spent four years at Montpellier, and among its lecturers were William of Nogaret, chancellor to Philip IV, Guillaume de Grimoard, afterwards Pope Urban V, and Pedro de Luna, afterwards antipope Benedict XIII.

Like all other provincial universities of France, that of Montpellier was suppressed at the outbreak of the French Revolution in 1793. The faculties of science and of letters were re-established in 1810; that of law in 1880. The University of Montpellier was officially re-organised in 1969, on the aftermath of May 1968 and the students&#x27; revolt all over the country. It was split into its successor institutions the University of Montpellier 1 (comprising the former faculties of medicine, law, and economy), University of Montpellier 2 (science and technology) and University of Montpellier 3 (social sciences, humanities and liberal arts).

On 1 January 2015, the University of Montpellier 1 and the University of Montpellier 2 merged to form the newly recreated University of Montpellier. Meanwhile, the Paul Valéry University Montpellier 3, now only Paul Valéry, remains a separate institution.

== Campuses ==
The university is located on several sites in the city of Montpellier, line 1 of the tramway connects almost all of the different sites:
* to the south of the city, the Richter campus served by the &quot;Port-Marianne&quot; and &quot;Rives du Lez&quot; stations, houses the Faculty of Economics, Montpellier management, the Institute for the Preparation for General Administration of Montpellier (IPAG) and the Student House &quot;Aimé-Schonenig&quot;;
* in the city center, served by the &quot;Louis Blanc&quot; and &quot;Place Albert 1er - Cathédrale&quot; stations, are located: the Faculty of Law &amp; Political Science, the historic building of the Faculty of Medicine, the botanical garden, the Institute of Biology housing medical and administrative services of the university, the administrative buildings located on Henri IV avenue and the presidency of the university located on Auguste-Broussonnet street in the former Institute of Botany;

<doc id="627316" wikidata="Q3695810" url="?curid=627316" title="Abdul Salam Zaeef">
<text>Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef (; born 1967) is an Afghan affiliated with the Taliban political / militant organization and a former Afghan ambassador to Pakistan before the US invasion of Afghanistan.

He was detained in Pakistan in the fall of 2001 and held until 2005 in the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp. The United Nations removed Zaeef from its list of terrorists in July 2010.

==Early life==
Zaeef was born in 1967 to a poor family in the small village of Zangiabad, between the Arghandab and Dori rivers, in the Panjwayi District of Kandahar Province in southern Afghanistan. His family had moved there a few years earlier, because of fighting over land in their home village of Jaldak in Zabul Province. His uncle, Mullah Nezam, was accused of killing 16 people in the fighting and was later killed by government forces. Zaeef&#x27;s mother died when he was one or two years old. The family moved to Mushan, another village nearby, and then to Rangrezan in Maywand District. His father died in 1975. Zaeef was taken to live with an aunt and cousins at Charshakha, then in Panjwayi District and now in Zhari District, for a year and a half. He then was taken to live with a maternal uncle and studied at a madrassa at Sangisar, receiving a basic religious education in the years before the Soviet invasion. In 1978 he attended primary school in Kandahar city for a year. That year the Communists took power in Afghanistan and fighting broke out between mujahideen and the government. He fled with his relatives and many others to Pakistan in January 1979, when he was 10 years old, ending up in a refugee camp in Nushki, Balochistan.

==Fighting the communists==
He returned to Afghanistan to fight with the mujahideen in 1983, when he was 15, without telling his relatives. After two months with a mujahideen group at Pashmol (now in Zhari District), he joined a group of fighting &quot;taliban&quot; (Islamic students and scholars) at Nelgham, not far from some of his childhood villages. A few days later, they were attacked by Afghan army and Soviet forces for ten days, before the &quot;taliban&quot; fled to Zangiabad. There the mujahideen were attacked for another ten days, with hundreds of mujahideen and civilians killed. Then the fighting moved to Pashmol for two weeks, until the mujahideen were driven out. Zaeef&#x27;s group continued to operate from Nelgham, sometimes travelling by foot as far as Helmand or Uruzgan provinces to fight, and undertaking religious study at the same time. After nearly a year with the &quot;taliban&quot;, he was ordered to take a badly wounded comrade to Pakistan for treatment, and there he reunited with his relatives, who had settled in Quetta. There he resumed school and religious studies for nine months. Then he received training from Pakistan&#x27;s Inter-Services Intelligence in rocket systems, before re-entering Afghanistan in 1985. While on the way to Kandahar, his group was ambushed, one of nine times he was ambushed during the war, and Zaeef was shot in the waist, after which he was taken back to Pakistan.

He fought in Kandahar Province for the next few years. He fought for weeks in the Battle of Arghandab in 1987, including at Sangisar, when Mullah Mohammed Omar was one of the commanders and was wounded, losing an eye. It was the last big battle in southern Kandahar. By 1988 Zaeef was a junior commander. In an attack on Kandahar Airport that year, he commanded 58 men and the fighting was so intense that 50 of them were killed.

==Taliban==
After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, he worked as a laborer and as a mullah in a village. Troubled by lawlessness that developed in Kandahar, in 1991 he took his wife and children and moved to Pakistan. In 1992 he returned and became the imam of a mosque in a small village near Kandahar. In 1994 he started to meet with other veterans of the war with the Soviets who wanted to take action against lawlessness and rogue mujahideen commanders who were controlling roads and cities. In the autumn of that year they approached various people to be their operational leader, including Mohammed Omar, who was living at Sangisar, who agreed. Forty to fifty people attended the founding meeting of what became known as the Taliban at the White Mosque at Sangisar. They started to apply sharia in the local area and set up a checkpoint on Highway 1 nearby. They gained support quickly and soon had 400 members. When rogue mujahideen on the highway through Maywand and Panjwayi districts refused to stop extorting and harassing road users, they attacked them. From there they then cleared the roads in Kandahar city and up to the border with Pakistan.

Once they had control of Kandahar, Zaeef was appointed to assist a sharia judge. In 1995 he was put in charge of the banks in Herat Province, which he did for two years. After the Taliban took control of Kabul, he was sent there to work in the Defence Ministry, and for nine months filled in as Defence minister, while Obaidullah was in Pakistan receiving treatment for an injury. He worked there for over a year and a half before resigning. He did not wish to return to work in the government, but the Taliban leaders appointed him deputy minister of Mines and Industry, a post he held for 18 months. Then he became head of transportation administration. Then in 2000 he was appointed ambassador to Pakistan, a post he held through the US attack on Afghanistan until 20 November 2001, when Pakistan ceased recognition of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Pakistani authorities arrested him in Islamabad on 2 January 2002 and sent him to Peshawar, where he was handed over to US operatives.

==Repatriation==
Zaeef was imprisoned at Bagram, then at Kandahar from 10 February to 1 July 2002, then at Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. He was released from Guantanamo Bay on 11 September 2005 and arrived back in Afghanistan the next day. In an article in the &quot;Daily Times&quot; on 18 September 2005, he was quoted as saying that his release was &quot;due to the effort of some friends&quot;.
He did not attribute his release to his Combatant Status Review Tribunal or his 2005 Administrative Review Board hearing. He described the actions of these two bodies as illegal.

Zaeef claims he was chained in illegal &quot;stress positions&quot; and subjected to sleep deprivation and extremes of temperature while held in the USA&#x27;s Bagram Theater Detention Facility.

==Recent events==
On 12 April 2007,
Zaeef stirred controversy by calling for a unity-government in Afghanistan.

On Friday, 6 June 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published excerpts from an interview with Zaeef.
It reported he claimed negotiations with the Taliban was the key to peace and that he argued that the presence of foreign troops eroded the authority of the central government:
An article in &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; on 12 April 2007 reported that Zaeef had moved into a &quot;...handsome guest house, located in the dusty modern neighborhood Khoshal Khan.&quot; The article in Der Spiegel stated that the new home Karzai&#x27;s government has provided Zaeef is around the corner from one occupied by former Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil. Der Spiegel described Zaeef&#x27;s home as being guarded, inside and out, by a heavily armed security detail. Der Spiegel described both Zaeef and Muttawakil as regarded as among the more moderate former members of the Taliban. Zaeef told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that Afghan security officials would not allow him to attend the mosque near his Kabul home.
On 15 June 2008, the McClatchy News Service published articles based on interviews with 66 former Guantanamo captives, including Abdul Salam Zaeef. The McClatchy reports state that guards told him he was the &quot;King of the prison&quot;, and that he took a lead role in the Guantanamo hunger strikes. They also state that guards in the Kandahar detention facility made him pointlessly move human excrement back and forth.

Zaeef acknowledged being invited by Saudi King Abdullah to unofficially meet with other leading Afghan figures from the Karzai government, the Taliban, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar&#x27;s Hezb-e-Islami and other former members of the Taliban.
Zaeef denied this meeting should be characterized as &quot;peace talks&quot; and stated that none of the individuals at this meeting had been authorized to conduct negotiations. Zaeef denied anyone discussed Afghanistan at this meeting. According to &quot;The Age,&quot; other figures who attended the meeting included former Taliban Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil and former Supreme Court Chief Justice Fazel Hadi Shinwari.

In October 2008, Zaeef said he would sue Pakistan for his arrest there in 2002.

On 9 April 2012, &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; reported that Zaeef had fled to the United Arab Emirates, quoting associates close to Zaeef who described repeated US attempts by US forces to raid Zaeef&#x27;s house and seize him. Zaeef had been in protective custody by the Afghan government since his release from Guantanamo.

Quoting &quot;Al Jazeera&quot; Waheed Muzhda:

In 2013, Mullah Zaeef met with Robert Grenier at a conference in which they discussed the invasion and the general positions of the Taliban government and the United States.

==Publications==
In mid-2006 Zaeef released a book in the Pashto language, &quot;A Picture of Guantanamo&quot;, detailing his mistreatment at Guantanamo. In October 2008, he edited the book &quot;Prisonnier à Guantanamo&quot;, EGDV/Documents, 2008, with French journalist Jean-Michel Caradec&#x27;h.

In January 2010, an English translation of Abdul Salam Zaeef&#x27;s autobiography was published, &quot;My Life with the Taliban&quot;. The book has been reviewed positively as offering a powerful look into what &quot;drives&quot; the Taliban.

<doc id="627321" wikidata="Q221519" url="?curid=627321" title="Burma campaign">
<text>The Burma campaign was a series of battles fought in the British colony of Burma. It was part of the South-East Asian theatre of World War II and primarily involved forces of the Allies (mainly from the British Empire and the Republic of China, with support from the United States) against the invading forces of the Empire of Japan. Imperial Japan was supported by the Thai Phayap Army, as well as two collaborationist independence movements and armies. Nominally independent puppet states were established in the conquered areas and some territories were annexed by Thailand. In 1942 and 1943, the international Allied force in British India launched several failed offensives to retake lost territories. Fighting intensified in 1944, and British Empire forces peaked at around 1 million land and air forces. These forces were drawn primarily from British India, with British Army forces (equivalent to eight regular infantry divisions and six tank regiments), 100,000 East and West African colonial troops, and smaller numbers of land and air forces from several other Dominions and Colonies. These additional forces allowed the Allied recapture of Burma in 1945.

The campaign had a number of notable features. The geographical characteristics of the region meant that weather, disease and terrain had a major effect on operations. The lack of transport infrastructure placed an emphasis on military engineering and air transport to move and supply troops, and evacuate wounded. The campaign was also politically complex, with the British, the United States and the Chinese all having different strategic priorities. It was also the only land campaign by the Western Allies in the Pacific Theatre which proceeded continuously from the start of hostilities to the end of the war. This was due to its geographical location. By extending from South East Asia to India, its area included some lands which the British lost at the outset of the war, but also included areas of India wherein the Japanese advance was eventually stopped. The climate of the region is dominated by the seasonal monsoon rains, which allowed effective campaigning for only just over half of each year. This, together with other factors such as famine and disorder in British India and the priority given by the Allies to the defeat of Nazi Germany, prolonged the campaign and divided it into four phases: the Japanese invasion, which led to the expulsion of British, Indian and Chinese forces in 1942; failed attempts by the Allies to mount offensives into Burma, from late 1942 to early 1944; the 1944 Japanese invasion of India, which ultimately failed following the battles of Imphal and Kohima; and finally the successful Allied offensive which liberated Burma from late 1944 to mid-1945.

The campaign was also strongly affected from the political atmosphere which erupted in the South-East Asian regions occupied by Japan, who pursued the Pan-Asianist policy of a &quot;Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere&quot;. These led to a Japanese-sponsored revolution during the initial invasion and the establishment of the State of Burma, whose Burma Independence Army had spearheaded the initial attacks against the country. The Provisional Government of Free India, with its Indian National Army fought under Imperial Japan, especially during Operation U-Go in 1944. The INA had earlier collaborated with Nazi Germany. The dominating attitude of the Japanese militarist who commanded the army stationed in the country, ultimately doomed the co-prosperity sphere as a whole, leading to local hopes for real independence fading and a revolt by the Burma National Army in 1945. On the Allied side, political relations were mixed for much of the war. The China Burma India Theater American-trained Chinese X Force led to cooperation between the two countries, but the clashing strategies proposed by General Joseph Stilwell and Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek would lead to Stilwell&#x27;s eventual removal from his position as American Commander of the theater. On the other hand, China–India relations were positive from the cooperative Burma Road, built to reach the Chinese Y Force and the Chinese war effort inside China, as well as from the heroic missions over the extremely dangerous air route over the Himalayas, nicknamed &quot;The Hump&quot;. The campaign would have a great impact on the independence struggle of Burma and India in the post-war years.

==Japanese conquest of Burma==
Japanese objectives in Burma were initially limited to the capture of Rangoon (now known as Yangon), the capital and principal seaport. This would close the overland supply line to China and provide a strategic bulwark to defend Japanese gains in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. The Japanese Fifteenth Army under Lieutenant General Shōjirō Iida, initially consisting of only two infantry divisions, moved into northern Thailand (which had signed a treaty of friendship with Japan), and launched an attack over jungle-clad mountain ranges into the southern Burmese province of Tenasserim (now Tanintharyi Region) in January 1942.

In the face of the Japanese advances, huge numbers of Indians, Anglo-Indians, and Anglo-Burmese fled Burma, around 600,000 by the autumn of 1942, which was until then the largest mass migration in history. Perhaps 80,000 of those in flight would die from starvation, exhaustion and disease. Some of the worst massacres in Burma during World War II would be perpetrated not by the Japanese but by Burmese gangs linked to the Burma Independence Army.

The Japanese successfully attacked over the Kawkareik Pass and captured the port of Moulmein at the mouth of the Salween River after overcoming stiff resistance. They then advanced northwards, outflanking successive British defensive positions. Troops of the 17th Indian Infantry Division tried to retreat over the Sittaung River, but Japanese parties reached the vital bridge before they did. On 22 February, the bridge was demolished to prevent its capture, a decision that has since been extremely contentious.

The loss of two brigades of 17th Indian Division meant that Rangoon could not be defended. General Archibald Wavell, the commander-in-chief of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, nevertheless ordered Rangoon to be held as he was expecting substantial reinforcements from the Middle East. Although some units arrived, counterattacks failed and the new commander of Burma Army (General Harold Alexander), ordered the city to be evacuated on 7 March after its port and oil refinery had been destroyed. The remnants of Burma Army broke out to the north, narrowly escaping encirclement.

On the eastern part of the front, in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road, the Chinese 200th Division held up the Japanese for a time around Toungoo, but after its fall the road was open for motorised troops of the Japanese 56th Division to shatter the Chinese Sixth Army to the east in the Karenni States and advance northward through the Shan States to capture Lashio, outflanking the Allied defensive lines and cutting off the Chinese armies from Yunnan. With the effective collapse of the entire defensive line, there was little choice left other than an overland retreat to India or to Yunnan.

===Japanese advance to the Indian frontier===

After the fall of Rangoon in March 1942, the Allies attempted to make a stand in the north of the country (Upper Burma), having been reinforced by a Chinese Expeditionary Force. The Japanese had also been reinforced by two divisions made available by the capture of Singapore and defeated both the newly organised Burma Corps and the Chinese force. The Allies were also faced with growing numbers of Burmese insurgents and the civil administration broke down in the areas they still held. With their forces cut off from almost all sources of supply, the Allied commanders finally decided to evacuate their forces from Burma. On 16 April, in Burma, 7,000 British soldiers were encircled by the Japanese 33rd Division during the Battle of Yenangyaung and rescued by the Chinese 38th Division.

The retreat was conducted in very difficult circumstances. Starving refugees, disorganised stragglers, and the sick and wounded clogged the primitive roads and tracks leading to India. Burma Corps managed to make it most of the way to Imphal, in Manipur in India, just before the monsoon broke in May 1942, having lost most of their equipment and transport. There, they found themselves living out in the open under torrential rains in extremely unhealthy circumstances. The army and civil authorities in India were very slow to respond to the needs of the troops and civilian refugees.

Due to lack of communication, when the British retreated from Burma, almost none of the Chinese knew about the retreat. Realising that they could not win without British support, some of the X Force committed by Chiang Kai-shek made a hasty and disorganised retreat to India, where they were put under the command of the American General Joseph Stilwell. After recuperating they were re-equipped and retrained by American instructors. The rest of the Chinese troops tried to return to Yunnan through remote mountainous forests and of these, at least half died.

===Thai army enters Burma===

In accordance with the Thai military alliance with Japan that was signed on 21 December 1941, on 21 March, the Thais and Japanese also agreed that the Karenni State and Shan States were to be under Thai control. The rest of Burma was to be under Japanese control.

The leading elements of the Thai Phayap Army under General J. R. Seriroengrit crossed the border into the Shan States on 10 May 1942. Three Thai infantry division and one cavalry division, spearheaded by armoured reconnaissance groups and supported by the Royal Thai Air Force, engaged the retreating Chinese 93rd Division. Kengtung, the main objective, was captured on 27 May. On 12 July, General Phin Choonhavan, who would become the Thai military governor of the occupied Shan State later in the war, ordered the 3rd Division of the Phayap Army from the southern part of the Shan State to occupy Karenni State and expel the Chinese 55th Division from Loikaw. The Chinese troops could not retreat because the routes to Yunnan were controlled by Axis forces and many Chinese soldiers were captured. The Thais remained in control of the Shan States for the remainder of the war. Their troops suffered from supply shortages and disease, but were not subjected to Allied attacks.

==Allied setbacks, 1942–1943==

The Japanese did not renew their offensive after the monsoon ended. They installed a nominally independent Burmese government under Ba Maw, and reformed the Burma Independence Army on a more regular basis as the Burma National Army under General Aung San. In practice, both government and army were strictly controlled by the Japanese authorities.

On the Allied side, operations in Burma over the remainder of 1942 and in 1943 were a study of military frustration. Britain could only maintain three active campaigns, and immediate offensives in both the Middle East and Far East proved impossible through lack of resources. The Middle East was accorded priority, being closer to home and in accordance with the &quot;Germany First&quot; policy in London and Washington.

The Allied build up was also hampered by the disordered state of Eastern India at the time. There were violent Quit India protests in Bengal and Bihar, which required large numbers of British troops to suppress. There was also a disastrous famine in Bengal, which may have led to 3 million deaths through starvation, disease and exposure. In such conditions of chaos, it was difficult to improve the inadequate lines of communication to the front line in Assam or make use of local industries for the war effort. Efforts to improve the training of Allied troops took time and in forward areas poor morale and endemic disease combined to reduce the strength and effectiveness of the fighting units.

Nevertheless, the Allies mounted two operations during the 1942–1943 dry season. The first was a small offensive into the coastal Arakan Province of Burma. The Indian Eastern Army intended to reoccupy the Mayu peninsula and Akyab Island, which had an important airfield. A division advanced to Donbaik, only a few miles from the end of the peninsula but was halted by a small but well entrenched Japanese force. At this stage of the war, the Allies lacked the means and tactical ability to overcome strongly constructed Japanese bunkers. Repeated British and Indian attacks failed with heavy casualties. Japanese reinforcements arrived from Central Burma and crossed rivers and mountain ranges which the Allies had declared to be impassable, to hit the Allies&#x27; exposed left flank and overrun several units. The exhausted British were unable to hold any defensive lines and were forced to abandon much equipment and fall back almost to the Indian frontier.

The second action was controversial. Under the command of Brigadier Orde Wingate, a long-range penetration unit known as the Chindits infiltrated through the Japanese front lines and marched deep into Burma, with the initial aim of cutting the main north–south railway in Burma in an operation codenamed Operation &quot;Longcloth&quot;. Some 3,000 men entered Burma in many columns. They damaged communications of the Japanese in northern Burma, cutting the railway for possibly two weeks but they suffered heavy casualties. Though the results were questioned the operation was used to propaganda effect, particularly to insist that British and Indian soldiers could live, move and fight as effectively as the Japanese in the jungle, doing much to restore morale among Allied troops.

==The balance shifts 1943–1944==

From December 1943 to November 1944 the strategic balance of the Burma campaign shifted decisively. Improvements in Allied leadership, training and logistics, together with greater firepower and growing Allied air superiority, gave Allied forces a confidence they had previously lacked. In the Arakan, XV Indian Corps withstood, and then broke, a Japanese counterstrike, while the Japanese invasion of India resulted in unbearably heavy losses and the ejection of the Japanese back beyond the Chindwin River.

===Allied plans===
In August 1943, the Allies created South East Asia Command (SEAC), a new combined command responsible for the South-East Asian Theatre, under Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. The training, equipment, health and morale of Allied troops under British Fourteenth Army under Lieutenant General William Slim was improving, as was the capacity of the lines of communication in North-eastern India. An innovation was the extensive use of aircraft to transport and supply troops.

SEAC had to accommodate several rival plans, many of which had to be dropped for lack of resources. Amphibious landings on the Andaman Islands (Operation &quot;Pigstick&quot;) and in Arakan were abandoned when the landing craft assigned were recalled to Europe in preparation for the Normandy Landings.

The major effort was intended to be by American-trained Chinese troops of Northern Combat Area Command (NCAC) under Stilwell, to cover the construction of the Ledo Road. Orde Wingate had controversially gained approval for a greatly expanded Chindit force, which was given the task of assisting Stilwell by disrupting the Japanese lines of supply to the northern front. Chiang Kai-shek had also agreed reluctantly to mount an offensive from the Yunnan.

Under British Fourteenth Army, the Indian XV Corps prepared to renew the advance in Arakan province, while IV Corps launched a tentative advance from Imphal in the centre of the long front to distract Japanese attention from the other offensives.

===Japanese plans===
About the same time that SEAC was established, the Japanese created the Burma Area Army under Lieutenant General Masakazu Kawabe, which took under command the Fifteenth Army and the newly formed Twenty-Eighth Army.

The new commander of Fifteenth Army, Lieutenant General Renya Mutaguchi was keen to mount an offensive against India. Burma Area Army originally quashed this idea, but found that their superiors at Southern Expeditionary Army Group HQ in Singapore were keen on it. When the staff at Southern Expeditionary Army were persuaded that the plan was inherently risky, they in turn found that Imperial General Headquarters in Tokyo was in favour of Mutaguchi&#x27;s plan.

The Japanese were influenced to an unknown degree by Subhas Chandra Bose, commander of the Indian National Army. This was composed largely of Indian soldiers who had been captured in Malaya or Singapore, and Indians (Tamils) living in Malaya. At Bose&#x27;s instigation, a substantial contingent of the INA joined in this &quot;Chalo Delhi&quot; (&quot;March on Delhi&quot;) with the war cry Jai Hind. Both Bose and Mutaguchi emphasised the advantages which would be gained by a successful attack into India. With misgivings on the part of several of Mutaguchi&#x27;s superiors and subordinates, Operation U-Go was launched.

===Northern and Yunnan front 1943–1944===
Stilwell&#x27;s forces (designated X Force) initially consisted of two American-equipped Chinese divisions with a Chinese-manned M3 Light Tank battalion and an American long-range penetration brigade known as &quot;Merrill&#x27;s Marauders&quot;.

In 1943, the Thai Phayap Army invasion headed to Xishuangbanna at China, but were driven back by the Chinese nationalist force.

In October 1943 the Chinese 38th Division led by Sun Li-jen began to advance from Ledo, Assam towards Myitkyina and Mogaung while American engineers and Indian labourers extended the Ledo Road behind them. The Japanese 18th Division was repeatedly outflanked by the Marauders and threatened with encirclement.

In Operation Thursday, the Chindits were to support Stilwell by interdicting Japanese communications in the region of Indaw. A brigade began marching across the Patkai mountains on 5 February 1944. In early March three other brigades were flown into landing zones behind Japanese lines by the Royal Air Force and the USAAF and established defensive strongholds around Indaw.

Meanwhile, the Chinese forces on the Yunnan front (Y Force) mounted an attack starting in the second half of April, with nearly 75,000 troops crossing the Salween river on a front. Soon some twelve Chinese divisions of 175,000 men, under General Wei Lihuang, were attacking the Japanese 56th Division. The Japanese forces in the North were now fighting on two fronts in northern Burma.

On 17 May, control of the Chindits passed from Slim to Stilwell. The Chindits now moved from the Japanese rear areas to new bases closer to Stilwell&#x27;s front, and were given additional tasks by Stilwell for which they were not equipped. They achieved several objectives, but at the cost of heavy casualties. By the end of June, they had linked up with Stilwell&#x27;s forces but were exhausted, and were withdrawn to India.

Also on 17 May, a force of two Chinese regiments, Unit Galahad (Merrill&#x27;s Marauders) and Kachin guerrillas captured the airfield at Myitkyina. The Allies did not immediately follow up this success and the Japanese were able to reinforce the town, which fell only after a siege that lasted until 3 August. The capture of Myitkyina airfield nevertheless immediately helped secure the air link from India to Chongqing over the Hump.

By the end of May, the Yunnan offensive, though hampered by the monsoon rains and lack of air support, succeeded in annihilating the garrison of Tengchong and eventually reached as far as Longling. Strong Japanese reinforcements then counterattacked and halted the Chinese advance.

===Southern front 1943–1944===
In Arakan, Indian XV Corps under Lieutenant General Philip Christison renewed the advance on the Mayu peninsula. Ranges of steep hills channelled the advance into three attacks each by an Indian or West African division. The 5th Indian Infantry Division captured the small port of Maungdaw on 9 January 1944. The Corps then prepared to capture two railway tunnels linking Maungdaw with the Kalapanzin valley but the Japanese struck first. A strong force from the Japanese 55th Division infiltrated Allied lines to attack the 7th Indian Infantry Division from the rear, overrunning the divisional HQ.

Unlike previous occasions on which this had happened, the Allied forces stood firm against the attack and supplies were dropped to them by parachute. In the Battle of the Admin Box from 5 to 23 February, the Japanese concentrated on XV Corps&#x27; Administrative Area, defended mainly by line of communication troops but they were unable to deal with tanks supporting the defenders, while troops from 5th Indian Division broke through the Ngakyedauk Pass to relieve the defenders of the box. Although battle casualties were approximately equal, the result was a heavy Japanese defeat. Their infiltration and encirclement tactics had failed to panic Allied troops and as the Japanese were unable to capture enemy supplies, they starved.

Over the next few weeks, XV Corps&#x27; offensive ended as the Allies concentrated on the Central Front. After capturing the railway tunnels, XV Corps halted during the monsoon.

==Japanese invasion of India 1944==

IV Corps, under Lieutenant-General Geoffry Scoones, had pushed forward two divisions to the Chindwin River. One division was in reserve at Imphal in Manipur. There were indications that a major Japanese offensive was building. Slim and Scoones planned to withdraw and force the Japanese to fight with their logistics stretched beyond the limit. However, they misjudged the date on which the Japanese were to attack, and the strength they would use against some objectives.

The Japanese Fifteenth Army consisted of three infantry divisions and a brigade-sized detachment (&quot;Yamamoto Force&quot;), and initially a regiment from the Indian National Army. Mutaguchi, the Army commander, planned to cut off and destroy the forward divisions of IV Corps before capturing Imphal, while the Japanese 31st Division isolated Imphal by capturing Kohima. Mutaguchi intended to exploit the capture of Imphal by capturing the strategic city of Dimapur, in the Brahmaputra River valley. If this could be achieved, the lines of communication to General Stilwell&#x27;s forces and the airbases used to supply the Chinese over the Hump would be cut.

The Japanese troops crossed the Chindwin River on 8 March. Scoones (and Slim) were slow to order their forward troops to withdraw and the 17th Indian Infantry Division was cut off at Tiddim. It fought its way back to Imphal with aid from Scoones&#x27;s reserve division, supplied by parachute drops. North of Imphal, 50th Indian Parachute Brigade was defeated at Sangshak by a regiment from the Japanese 31st Division on its way to Kohima. Imphal was thus left vulnerable to an attack by the Japanese 15th Division from the north but because the diversionary attack launched by Japanese in Arakan had already been defeated, Slim was able to move the 5th Indian Division by air to the Central Front. Two brigades went to Imphal, the other went to Dimapur from where it sent a detachment to Kohima.

By the end of the first week in April, IV Corps had concentrated in the Imphal plain. The Japanese launched several offensives during the month, which were repulsed. At the start of May, Slim and Scoones began a counter-offensive against the Japanese 15th Division north of Imphal. Progress was slow, as movement was made difficult by monsoon rains and IV Corps was short of supplies.

Also at the beginning of April, the Japanese 31st Division under Lieutenant-General Kotoku Sato reached Kohima. Instead of isolating the small British garrison there and pressing on with his main force to Dimapur, Sato chose to capture the hill station. The siege lasted from 5 to 18 April, when the exhausted defenders were relieved. A new formation HQ, the Indian XXXIII Corps under Lieutenant-General Montagu Stopford, now took over operations on this front. The 2nd British Infantry Division began a counter-offensive and by 15 May, they had prised the Japanese off Kohima Ridge itself. After a pause during which more Allied reinforcements arrived, XXXIII Corps renewed its offensive.

By now, the Japanese were at the end of their endurance. Their troops (particularly 15th and 31st Divisions) were starving, and during the monsoon, disease spread rapidly among them. Lieutenant-General Sato had notified Mutaguchi that his division would withdraw from Kohima at the end of May if it were not supplied. In spite of orders to hold on, Sato did indeed retreat. The leading troops of IV Corps and XXXIII Corps met at Milestone 109 on the Dimapur-Imphal road on 22 June, and the siege of Imphal was raised.

Mutaguchi (and Kawabe) continued to order renewed attacks. 33rd Division and Yamamoto Force made repeated efforts, but by the end of June they had suffered so many casualties both from battle and disease that they were unable to make any progress. The Imphal operation was finally broken off early in July, and the Japanese retreated painfully to the Chindwin River.

It was the greatest defeat to that date in Japanese history. They had suffered 50–60,000 dead, and 100,000 or more casualties. Most of these losses were the result of disease, malnutrition and exhaustion. The Allies suffered 12,500 casualties, including 2,269 killed. Mutaguchi had already relieved all his divisions&#x27; commanders, and was himself subsequently relieved of command.

During the monsoon from August to November, Fourteenth Army pursued the Japanese to the Chindwin River. While the 11th East Africa Division advanced down the Kabaw Valley from Tamu, the 5th Indian Division advanced along the mountainous Tiddim road. By the end of November, Kalewa had been recaptured, and several bridgeheads were established on the east bank of the Chindwin.

==Allied capture of Burma 1944–1945==


The Allies launched a series of offensive operations into Burma during late 1944 and the first half of 1945. The command on the front was rearranged in November 1944. Eleventh Army Group HQ was replaced by Allied Land Forces South East Asia and NCAC and XV Corps were placed directly under this new headquarters. Although the Allies were still attempting to complete the Ledo Road, it was apparent that it would not materially affect the course of the war in China.

The Japanese also made major changes in their command. The most important was the replacement of General Kawabe at Burma Area Army by Hyotaro Kimura. Kimura threw Allied plans into confusion by refusing to fight at the Chindwin River. Recognising that most of his formations were weak and short of equipment, he withdrew his forces behind the Irrawaddy River, forcing the Allies to greatly extend their lines of communication.

===Southern front 1944–1945===
In Arakan, XV Corps resumed its advance on Akyab Island for the third year in succession. This time the Japanese were far weaker, and retreated before the steady Allied advance. They evacuated Akyab Island on 31 December 1944. It was occupied by XV Corps without resistance on 3 January 1945 as part of Operation Talon, the amphibious landing at Akyab.

Landing craft had now reached the theatre, and XV Corps launched amphibious attacks on the Myebon peninsula on 12 January 1945 and at Kangaw ten days later during the Battle of Hill 170 to cut off the retreating Japanese. There was severe fighting until the end of the month, in which the Japanese suffered heavy casualties.

An important objective for XV Corps was the capture of Ramree Island and Cheduba Island to construct airfields which would support the Allies&#x27; operations in Central Burma. Most of the Japanese garrison died during the Battle of Ramree Island. XV Corps operations on the mainland were curtailed to release transport aircraft to support Fourteenth Army.

===Northern front 1944–1945===
NCAC resumed its advance late in 1944, although it was progressively weakened by the flyout of Chinese troops to the main front in China. On 10 December 1944, the 36th British Infantry Division on NCAC&#x27;s right flank made contact with units of Fourteenth Army near Indaw in Northern Burma. Five days later, Chinese troops on the command&#x27;s left flank captured the city of Bhamo.

NCAC made contact with Chiang&#x27;s Yunnan armies on 21 January 1945, and the Ledo road could finally be completed, although by this point in the war its value was uncertain. Chiang ordered the American General Daniel Isom Sultan, commanding NCAC, to halt his advance at Lashio, which was captured on 7 March. This was a blow to British plans as it endangered the prospects of reaching Yangon before the onset of the monsoon, expected at the beginning of May. Winston Churchill, British Prime Minister, appealed directly to American chief of staff George Marshall for the transport aircraft which had been assigned to NCAC to remain in Burma. From 1 April, NCAC&#x27;s operations stopped, and its units returned to China and India. A US-led guerrilla force, OSS Detachment 101, took over the remaining military responsibilities of NCAC.

===Central front 1944–1945===

The Fourteenth Army, now consisting of IV Corps and XXXIII Corps, made the main offensive effort into Burma. Although the Japanese retreat over the Irrawaddy forced the Allies to completely change their plans, such was the Allies&#x27; material superiority that this was done. IV Corps was switched in secret from the right to the left flank of the army and aimed to cross the Irrawaddy near Pakokku and seize the Japanese line-of-communication centre of Meiktila, while XXXIII Corps continued to advance on Mandalay.

During January and February 1945, XXXIII Corps seized crossings over the Irrawaddy River near Mandalay. There was heavy fighting, which attracted Japanese reserves and fixed their attention. Late in February, the 7th Indian Division leading IV Corps, seized crossings at Nyaungu near Pakokku. 17th Indian Division and 255th Indian Tank Brigade followed them across and struck for Meiktila. In the open terrain of Central Burma, this force outmanoeuvred the Japanese and fell on Meiktila on 1 March. The town was captured in four days, despite resistance to the last man.

The Japanese tried first to relieve the garrison at Meiktila and then to recapture the town and destroy its defenders. Their attacks were not properly coordinated and were repulsed. By the end of March the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties and lost most of their artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. They broke off the attack and retreated to Pyawbwe.

XXXIII Corps had renewed its attack on Mandalay. It fell to 19th Indian Division on 20 March, though the Japanese held the former citadel which the British called Fort Dufferin for another week. Much of the historically and culturally significant portions of Mandalay were burned to the ground.

===Race for Rangoon===

Though the Allied force had advanced successfully into central Burma, it was vital to capture the port of Rangoon before the monsoon to avoid a logistics crisis. In the spring of 1945, the other factor in the race for Rangoon was the years of preparation by the liaison organisation, Force 136, which resulted in a national uprising within Burma and the defection of the entire Burma National Army to the allied side. In addition to the allied advance, the Japanese now faced open rebellion behind their lines.

XXXIII Corps mounted Fourteenth Army&#x27;s secondary drive down the Irrawaddy River valley against stiff resistance from the Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army. IV Corps made the main attack down the &quot;Railway Valley&quot;, which was also followed by the Sittaung River. They began by striking at a Japanese delaying position (held by the remnants of the Japanese Thirty-Third Army) at Pyawbwe. The attackers were initially halted by a strong defensive position behind a dry waterway, but a flanking move by tanks and mechanised infantry struck the Japanese from the rear and shattered them.

From this point, the advance down the main road to Rangoon faced little organised opposition. An uprising by Karen guerillas prevented troops from the reorganised Japanese Fifteenth Army from reaching the major road centre of Taungoo before IV Corps captured it. The leading Allied troops met Japanese rearguards north of Bago, north of Rangoon, on 25 April. Heitarō Kimura had formed the various service troops, naval personnel and even Japanese civilians in Yangon into the 105 Independent Mixed Brigade. This scratch formation held up the British advance until 30 April and covered the evacuation of the Rangoon area.

===Operation Dracula===
The original conception of the plan to re-take Burma had envisaged XV Corps making an amphibious assault on Rangoon well before Fourteenth Army reached the capital, in order to ease supply problems. This operation, codenamed Operation Dracula, was postponed several times as the necessary landing craft were retained in Europe and finally dropped in favour of an attack on Phuket Island, off the west coast of Thailand.

Slim feared that the Japanese would defend Rangoon to the last man through the monsoon, which would put Fourteenth Army in a disastrous supply situation. He therefore asked for Operation Dracula to be re-mounted at short notice. The naval forces for the attack on Phuket were diverted to Operation Dracula, and units of XV Corps were embarked from Akyab and Ramree.

On 1 May, a Gurkha parachute battalion was dropped on Elephant Point, and cleared Japanese rearguards from the mouth of the Yangon River. The 26th Indian Infantry Division landed by ship the next day. When they arrived they discovered that Kimura had ordered Rangoon to be evacuated, starting on 22 April. After the Japanese withdrawal, Yangon had experienced an orgy of looting and lawlessness similar to the last days of the British in the city in 1942. On the afternoon of 2 May 1945, the monsoon rains began in full force. The Allied drive to liberate Rangoon before the rains had succeeded with only a few hours to spare.

The leading troops of the 17th and 26th Indian divisions met at Hlegu, north of Rangoon, on 6 May.

==Final operations==
After the Allies captured Rangoon, a new Twelfth Army headquarters was created from XXXIII Corps HQ to take control of the formations which were to remain in Burma.

The Japanese Twenty-Eighth Army, after withdrawing from Arakan and resisting XXXIII Corps in the Irrawaddy valley, retreated into the Pegu Yomas, a range of low jungle-covered hills between the Irrawaddy and Sittang rivers. They planned to break out and rejoin Burma Area Army. To cover this break-out, Kimura ordered Thirty-Third Army to mount a diversionary offensive across the Sittang, although the entire army could muster the strength of barely a regiment. On 3 July, they attacked British positions in the &quot;Sittang Bend&quot;. On 10 July, after a battle for country which was almost entirely flooded, both the Japanese and the Allies withdrew.

The Japanese had attacked too early. Sakurai&#x27;s Twenty-Eighth Army was not ready to start the break-out until 17 July. The break-out was a disaster. The British had placed ambushes or artillery concentrations on the routes the Japanese were to use. Hundreds of men drowned trying to cross the swollen Sittang on improvised bamboo floats and rafts. Burmese guerrillas and bandits killed stragglers east of the river. The break-out cost the Japanese nearly 10,000 men, half the strength of Twenty-Eighth Army. British and Indian casualties were minimal.

Fourteenth Army (now under Lieutenant General Miles Dempsey) and XV Corps had returned to India to plan the next stage of the campaign to re-take Southeast Asia. A new corps, the Indian XXXIV Corps, under Lieutenant-General Ouvry Lindfield Roberts was raised and assigned to Fourteenth Army for further operations.

This was to be an amphibious assault on the western side of Malaya codenamed Operation Zipper. The surrender of Japan forestalled this operation, but it was undertaken post-war as the quickest way of getting occupation troops into Malaya.

==Results==

Generally, the recovery of Burma is reckoned as a triumph for the British Indian Army and resulted in the greatest defeat the Japanese armies had suffered to that date. 

The attempted Japanese invasion of India in 1944 was launched on unrealistic premises as after the Singapore debacle and the loss of Burma in 1942, the British were bound to defend India at all costs. A successful invasion by Japanese Imperial forces would have been disastrous. The defence operations at Kohima and Imphal in 1944 have since taken on huge symbolic value as the turning of the tide in British fortunes in the war in the East.

The American historian Raymond Callahan concluded &quot;Slim&#x27;s great victory ... helped the British, unlike the French, Dutch or, later, the Americans, to leave Asia with some dignity&quot;.

After the war ended, a combination of the pre-war agitation among the Bamar population for independence and the economic ruin of Burma during the four-year campaign made it impossible for the former regime to be resumed. Within three years both Burma and India were independent.

American goals in Burma had been to aid the Nationalist Chinese regime. Apart from the &quot;Hump&quot; airlift, these bore no fruit until so near the end of the war that they made little contribution to the defeat of Japan. These efforts have also been criticised as fruitless because of the self-interest and corruption of Chiang Kai-Shek&#x27;s regime.

<text>The Balkans campaign of World War II began with the Italian invasion of Greece on 28 October 1940. In the early months of 1941, Italy&#x27;s offensive had stalled and a Greek counter-offensive pushed into Albania. Germany sought to aid Italy by deploying troops to Romania and Bulgaria and attacking Greece from the east. Meanwhile, the British landed troops and aircraft to shore up Greek defences. A &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; in Yugoslavia on 27 March caused Adolf Hitler to order the conquest of that country.

The invasion of Yugoslavia by Germany and Italy began on 6 April 1941, simultaneously with the renewed invasion of Greece; on 11 April, Hungary joined the invasion of Yugoslavia. By 17 April the Yugoslavs had signed an armistice, and by 30 April all of mainland Greece was under German or Italian control. On 20 May Germany invaded Crete by air, and by 1 June all remaining Greek and British forces on the island had surrendered. Although it had not participated in the attacks in April, Bulgaria occupied parts of both Yugoslavia and Greece shortly thereafter for the remainder of the war in the Balkans.

==Background==
After World War I, with the complete collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Albanians looked to the Kingdom of Italy for protection against its traditional enemies. In 1919, Albania&#x27;s territorial integrity was confirmed at the Paris Peace Conference after United States President Woodrow Wilson opposed a plan by the European powers to divide Albania amongst its neighbors. However, after 1925, Italian dictator Benito Mussolini sought to dominate Albania. In 1928, Albania became a kingdom under Zog I, who was a clan chief and former Prime Minister. Zog failed to stave off Italian ascendancy in Albanian internal affairs. On 7 April 1939, Italian troops invaded Albania, overthrew Zog, and annexed the country to the Italian Empire.

==Campaign==

===Greco-Italian War===

The Italian invasion of Greece lasted from 28 October 1940 to 30 April 1941. Italian forces invaded Greece and made limited gains. But soon the Greeks counter-attacked and the Italians were driven back to the Albanian border. In this period the United Kingdom was supporting the Greeks with the Royal Air Force, but the arrival of British and Commonwealth ground troops in Greece was delayed due to operations in North Africa. The Italians spent much of the winter stabilizing a line which left them in control of only about two-thirds of Albania. A much anticipated Italian offensive in March 1941 resulted in few territorial gains. Germany, led by Adolf Hitler, intervened in April and invaded Greece after the successful invasion of Yugoslavia. Meanwhile the Italian 9th and 11th armies began to pursue the retreating Greek units back to the mainland. Although the Greek units fought the Italians as rearguards and delaying their advance as possibile. On 23 April. Greece officially surrendered both to Italy and Germany.

===Invasion of Yugoslavia===
The invasion of Yugoslavia (also known as &quot;Operation 25&quot;) began on 6 April 1941 and ended with the unconditional surrender of the Royal Yugoslav Army on 17 April. The invading Axis powers (Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and Hungary) occupied and dismembered the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. By cobbling together Bosnia and Herzegovina, some parts of Croatia, and Syrmia, the &quot;Independent State of Croatia&quot; (&quot;Nezavisna Država Hrvatska&quot;, NDH) was created by Germany and Italy. In some of the territory of the former Kingdom of Serbia and the Banat, the German-occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia, the Germans appointed a puppet government, the Government of National Salvation led by Milan Nedić. Montenegro remained under Italian occupation, and Bulgaria was permitted to annex eastern areas of Yugoslavia, including most of modern-day North Macedonia.

===Battle of Greece===
Hitler began planning to invade Greece in November 1940, after the British occupied Crete and Lemnos. He ordered the invasion of Greece — code-named (&quot;Operation Marita&quot;) — on 13 December 1940 for execution in March 1941. The stated aim of the operation was to prevent the British from getting air bases within striking range of the Romanian oilfields. On 6 April 1941, the German Army invaded northern Greece, while other elements launched an attack against Yugoslavia. Breaking through the Yugoslav lines in southern Yugoslavia allowed Germany to send reinforcements to the battlefields of northern Greece. The German army out-flanked the Greek Metaxas Line fortifications and, despite the assistance provided by a British expeditionary corps, set out to capture the southern Greek cities. The Battle of Greece ended with the German entry into Athens and the capture of the Peloponnese, although about 40,000 Allied soldiers were evacuated to Crete, prompting one of the largest airborne attacks in the history of warfare: Operation Merkur, or the Battle of Crete.

===Battle of Crete===

On 20 May 1941, German paratroopers were dropped over the airfields of northern Crete to occupy the island. They were met by heavy resistance from Allied forces and the local Cretan population but eventually the defenders were overwhelmed by the German forces. The British Government ordered an evacuation on 27 May and the remaining forces surrendered on 1 June. However, the heavy losses incurred by the paratroopers convinced the Supreme Command of the Wehrmacht to abandon large-scale airborne operations for the remainder of the war.

==Result==
By 1 June 1941, all of Albania, Yugoslavia and Greece were under Axis control. Greece was placed under triple occupation, and Yugoslavia was dissolved and occupied. Germany had gained a significant strategic advantage: direct access to the Mediterranean.

===Bulgarian occupation===

On 6 April 1941, despite having officially joined the Axis Powers, the Bulgarian government did not participate in the invasion of Yugoslavia and the Battle of Greece. On 20 April, the Bulgarian Army occupied most of Western Thrace and the Greek province of Eastern Macedonia, which had been already conquered by Germany, with the goal of restoring its pre-World War I outlet to the Aegean Sea. Bulgarian troops also occupied much of eastern Serbia, where Vardar Banovina was divided between Bulgaria and the Italians.

===Resistance movements===

Throughout the remainder of the war, active Yugoslav, Greek, and Albanian resistance movements forced Germany and its allies to garrison hundreds of thousands of soldiers permanently in the three countries, denying them to the other fronts. Especially in Yugoslavia after 1943, the threat of an Allied invasion and the activities of the partisans necessitated large-scale counter-insurgency operations, involving several divisions.

<doc id="627330" wikidata="Q5613311" url="?curid=627330" title="Guaifenesin protocol">
<text>Guaifenesin protocol is an unapproved treatment for fibromyalgia suggested in the 1990s by R. Paul St. Amand, M.D. The protocol involves three parts: titrating the guaifenesin dosage, avoiding salicylates, and following a low-carbohydrate diet if the patient is hypoglycemic. As of 2015, the protocol had not been shown to be effective in clinical trials, and guaifenesin had not been approved by the FDA for fibromyalgia. Despite the lack of clinical efficacy, the protocol has been adopted by many due to anecdotal evidence of success.

==Efficacy==
In a 2017 multicenter, placebo-controlled, repeat-dose, parallel study of 77 randomly assigned adults, results suggested the potential for OTC dose of oral guaifenesin 1200 mg BID to provide symptomatic relief of upper back musculoskeletal pain and spasm.

Results of the only reported randomized clinical trial in 1996 found that guaifenesin had no significant effects on pain, other symptoms, or laboratory measures (serum and urinary levels of uric acid and phosphate) over 12 months in a sample of people diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome. The lead author of the study has suggested a number of reasons why some patients may have previously reported benefits on this protocol, concluding &quot;St. Amand has unknowingly used guaifenesin as a powerful focus in a program of cognitive behavioral therapy, in which his empathy, enthusiasm and charisma were the real instruments in effecting a beneficial change.&quot; St. Amand, who participated as a &quot;Study Advisor&quot; to this clinical trial, has stated that the study did not control for salicylate use, and therefore did not study the protocol as a whole. He has recommended a follow-up study be conducted which controls for all elements of the protocol. The lead author of the study counters that none of the subjects exhibited any signs of salicylate use.

<doc id="627335" wikidata="Q1688021" url="?curid=627335" title="Russell Tribunal">
<text>The Russell Tribunal, also known as the International War Crimes Tribunal, Russell–Sartre Tribunal, or Stockholm Tribunal, was a private people&#x27;s tribunal organised in 1966 by Bertrand Russell, British philosopher and Nobel Prize winner, and hosted by French philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre, along with Lelio Basso, Simone de Beauvoir, Vladimir Dedijer, Ralph Schoenman, Isaac Deutscher, Günther Anders, Lázaro Cárdenas and several others. The tribunal investigated and evaluated American foreign policy and military intervention in Vietnam.

Bertrand Russell justified the establishment of this body as follows:

The tribunal was constituted in November 1966, and was conducted in two sessions in 1967, in Stockholm, Sweden and Roskilde, Denmark. Bertrand Russell&#x27;s book on the armed confrontations underway in Vietnam, &quot;War Crimes in Vietnam&quot;, was published in January 1967. His postscript called for establishing this investigative body. The findings of the tribunal were largely ignored in the United States.

Further tribunals were also held on various other issues, including psychiatry, human rights, and the Israel-Palestine conflict and, most recently, on the disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.

==Composition and origin==
The idea for the tribunal was first proposed to Russell in 1965 by M.S. Arnoni. Representatives of 18 countries participated in the tribunal&#x27;s two sessions. The tribunal committee, which called itself the International War Crimes Tribunal, consisted of 25 notable individuals, predominantly from leftist peace organisations, including winners of the Nobel Prize, Medals of Valor, and awards of recognition in humanitarian and social fields. Neither Vietnam nor the United States was directly represented by any individual on the 25-member panel, although a couple of members were American citizens.

More than 30 people, including military personnel from the United States, and both of the warring factions in Vietnam, gave evidence to the tribunal. Financing for the Tribunal included a large contribution from the North Vietnamese government after a request made by Russell to Ho Chi Minh.

== Aims ==
The Tribunal aims were stated as follows:

:We constitute ourselves a Tribunal which, even if it has not the power to impose sanctions, will have to answer, amongst others, the following questions:

::# Has the United States Government (and the Governments of Australia, New Zealand and South Korea) committed acts of aggression according to international law?
::# Has the American army made use of or experimented with new weapons or weapons forbidden by the laws of war?
::# Has there been bombardment of targets of a purely civilian character, for example hospitals, schools, sanatoria, dams, etc., and on what scale has this occurred?
::# Have Vietnamese prisoners been subjected to inhuman treatment forbidden by the laws of war and, in particular, to torture or mutilation? Have there been unjustified reprisals against the civilian population, in particular, execution of hostages?
::# Have forced labour camps been created, has there been deportation of the population or other acts tending to the extermination of the population and which can be characterised juridically as acts of genocide?

:All participants in the war in Southeast Asia are petitioned to attend and present evidence, including Vietnam, Cambodia and the United States, as noted in this excerpt from the Tribunal&#x27;s description of aims and intent:

::&quot;This Tribunal will examine all the evidence that may be placed before it by any source or party. The evidence may be oral, or in the form of documents. No evidence relevant to our purposes will be refused attention. ... The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam have assured us of their willingness to co-operate ... The Cambodian Head of State, Prince Sihanouk, has similarly offered to help ... We invite the Government of the United States to present evidence or cause it to be presented ... Our purpose is to establish, without fear or favour, the full truth about this war. We sincerely hope that our efforts will contribute to the world&#x27;s justice, to the re-establishment of peace and the liberation of oppressed peoples.&quot;

== Conclusions and verdicts ==
The Tribunal stated that its conclusions were:

:# &quot;Has the Government of the United States committed acts of aggression against Vietnam under the terms of international law?&quot; Yes (unanimously).
:# &quot;Has there been, and if so, on what scale, bombardment of purely civilian targets, for example, hospitals, schools, medical establishments, dams, etc?&quot;Yes (unanimously).

:# &quot;Have the armed forces of the United States subjected the civilian population to inhuman treatment prohibited by international law?&quot;Yes (unanimously).
:# &quot;Is the United States Government guilty of genocide against the people of Vietnam?&quot;Yes (unanimously).

Prompted in part by the My Lai Massacre, in 1969 the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation organised Citizens Commissions of Inquiry (CCI) to hold hearings intended to document testimony of war crimes in Indochina. These hearings were held in several American cities, and would eventually form the foundation of two national investigations: the National Veterans Inquiry sponsored by the CCI, and the Winter Soldier Investigation sponsored by the Vietnam Veterans Against the War.

== Reasoning for verdicts ==

=== Verdict 11: Genocide ===
John Gerassi was an investigator for the Tribunal and documented that the United States was bombing hospitals, schools and other civilian targets in Vietnam. He offers first hand and documentary evidence about US war crimes. His book provides many details of US atrocities and shows the larger motivation for the Tribunal on the accusation of genocide rests from the clear need to expose documented atrocities against civilians rather than an actual ongoing genocide.

Jean-Paul Sartre bases his argument for genocide on several reasons, but part of it rests on statements and declarations from US leaders and &quot;intention&quot; rather than conduct. &quot;In particular, we must try to understand whether there is an &quot;intention of genocide&quot; in the war that the American government is fighting against Vietnam. Article 2 of the Convention of 1948 defines genocide on the basis of intention.&quot; And that &quot;Recently, Dean Rusk has declared: &#x27;We are defending ourselves ... It is the &quot;United States&quot; that is in danger in Saigon. This means that their first aim is military: it is to encircle Communist China, the major obstacle to their expansionism. Thus, they will not let south-east Asia escape. America has put men in power in Thailand, it controls part of Laos and threatens to invade Cambodia. But these conquests will be useless if the US has to face a free Vietnam with thirty-one million united people.&quot; Furthermore that &quot;At this point in our discussion, three facts emerge: (1) the US government wants a base and an example; (2) this can be achieved, without any greater obstacle than the resistance of the Vietnamese people themselves, by liquidating an entire people and establishing a Pax Americana on a Vietnamese desert; (3) to attain the second, the US &quot;must&quot; achieve, at least partially, this extermination.&quot;

== Subsequent tribunals ==

Additional tribunals using the same model and the denomination &quot;Russell Tribunal&quot; have been held. The Second Russell Tribunal on Latin America was held over three sessions that spanned three years and focused on human rights violations during the military dictatorships in Argentina and Brazil (Rome, 1974), on Chile&#x27;s military coup d&#x27;état (Rome, 1974–76), the third tribunal focused on the situation of Human Rights in Germany (1978), the fourth tribunal focused on the rights of the Indians of the Americas (Rotterdam 1980), subsequent tribunals forcused on the Threat of Indigenous Peoples of America (1982), on Human Rights in Psychiatry (Berlin, 2001), on Iraq (Brussels, 2004), and on Palestine (Barcelona, 2009–12). The tribunal was criticised by some historians and activists who argue against its lack of standing.

At the closing session of the Russell Tribunal the creation of three new institutions was announced: the International Foundation for the Rights and Liberations of Peoples, and the International League for the Rights and Liberations of Peoples, and the Permanent Peoples&#x27; Tribunal.

The Permanents People&#x27;s Tribunal was established in Bologna on 23 June 1979. Between its founding and April 1984, the tribunal pronounced two advisory opinions on Western Sahara and Eritrea and held eight sessions (Argentina, Philippines, El Salvador, Afghanistan I and II, East Timor, Zaire and Guatemala). The latter was concluded in January 1983 in Madrid.

A special hearing was conducted in Paris on 13–16 April 1984 to investigate the Armenian genocide. The Tribunal&#x27;s 35-member panel included three Nobel Prize winners—Seán MacBride, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel and Professor George Wald— and ten eminent jurist, theologians, academics and political figures. The tribunal concluded that genocide was already prohibited by law at the time the Armenian Genocide took place - that though not explicitly banned by written rules it was not legally tolerated - thus the 1948 International Convention for the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide was formally expressing an already existing prohibition. The tribunal concluded that the massacres of Armenians between 1915 and 1917 revealed the intention of the systematic extermination of the Armenian people, intent as specified in article II of the 1948 convention, and that it was undoubtedly a genocide, the manifestation of a policy that had emerged in the Ottoman Empire in the 1890s. The tribunal criticised as unacceptable the denial (&quot;il diniego abusive&quot; &quot;the abusive refusal&quot;) of the genocide by Turkish governments since the establishment of the Kemalist republic.

More than three decades later, the Russell Tribunal model was followed by the World Tribunal on Iraq, which was held to make a similar analysis of the Project for the New American Century, the 2003 Invasion of Iraq and subsequent occupation of Iraq, and the links between these.

===1974–76: On Repression in Brazil, Chile, and Latin America (Rome, Brussels)===
After Russell&#x27;s death in 1970, Senator Lelio Basso began organizing a second tribunal in 1973 initially focused on human rights violations in Brazil, which then expanded to include Chile in the wake of the military coup in that country, and then to all of Latin America. The official name chosen by the constituents was &quot;Russel Tribunal II on the Repression in Brazil, Chile and in Latin America&quot; and was held in three sessions from 1974 to 1976 in Rome and Brussels. Basso presided over the tribunal and writer Gabriel García Márquez, historians Vladimir Dedijer and Albert Soboul, and professor of law François Rigaux served as vice-presidents.

===2001: On Human Rights in Psychiatry (Berlin)===
In 2001, Thomas Szasz and others took part in a Russell Tribunal on Human Rights in Psychiatry held in Berlin between 30 June and 2 July. The Tribunal brought in the two following verdicts: the majority verdict claimed that there was &quot;serious abuse of human rights in psychiatry&quot; and that psychiatry was &quot;guilty of the combination of force and unaccountability&quot;; the minority verdict, signed by the Israeli Law Professor Alon Harel and Brazilian novelist Paulo Coelho, called for &quot;public critical examination of the role of psychiatry.&quot;

=== 2004: On Iraq (Brussels)===
In 2004 the &quot;BRussells Tribunal&quot; took place in Brussels as a continuation of the tradition of the Russell Tribunal as part of the World Tribunal on Iraq. Philosopher Jacques Derrida praised this event, stating that &quot;to resuscitate the tradition of a Russell Tribunal is symbolically an important and necessary thing to do today.&quot;

=== 2009–2014: On Palestine (Barcelona, London, Cape Town, New York, Brussels)===
The Russell Tribunal on Palestine (RToP) was created in March 2009.

In April 2011, the association converted to a non-profit organisation, with legal status in Brussels, by , Jacques Michiels, Jacques Debatty, Nadia Farkh, Henri Eisendrath and Roseline Sonet. The former non-elected PS senator, Galand, was appointed president of the association.

The first session of the Tribunal took place in Barcelona in March 2010 This session&#x27;s objective was to consider the complicities and omissions of the European Union and its member states in the Palestinian-Israel conflict. The second international session of the RToP took place in London in November 2010. It examined international corporate issues in Israel and human rights law.

The third international session of the RToP took place in Cape Town in November 2011. It asked the question: &quot;Are Israeli practices against the Palestinian people in breach of the prohibition on apartheid under international law?&quot;

Pierre Galand pointed out that the Cape Town session of the tribunal had a budget of €190,000; €100,000 was donated by Editions Indigene, the publisher of the book &quot;Time for an outrage&quot;. More than €15,000 was raised at a 24 September 2011 fundraising event by the Belgian support committee of the Russell Tribunal. The Caipirinha Foundation lists the RToP as a grant receiver, but does not disclose the amount or the year of its grant.

A fourth international session of the RToP took place in New York on 6–7 October 2012.

A fifth session met in Brussels on 16–17 March 2013.

An extraordinary session was held in Brussels on 24 September 2014 in response to Israel&#x27;s Operation Protective Edge launched in the Gaza Strip on 8 July 2014.

=== 2021: On Kashmir (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina) ===

The Russell Tribunal on Kashmir was launched in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Hercegovina, and took place on 17–19 December 2021. It was organized by Canadian NGO Kashmir Civitas whose Secretary-General is Canadian academic Farhan Mujahid Chak, and attended by Richard Falk, Sami al-Arian, Jonathan A.C. Brown, David Hearst, and Omar Suleiman The event had support/partnerships with the World Kashmir Awareness Forum, Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, Permanent Peoples&#x27; Tribunal, Aljazeera Balkans, Nahla, Center for Advanced Studies in Sarajevo, and International University of Sarajevo.

Decolonization, settler-colonialism, crimes against humanity, genocide and nuclear threats emerging from the disputed territory of Indian-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir were marked at an inaugural tribunal in Sarajevo that sought to draw global attention to the atrocities committed in the Muslim-majority region.

== Criticisms ==
The tribunal did not investigate alleged war crimes by the Viet Cong; Ralph Schoenman commented: &quot;Lord Russell would think no more of doing that than of trying the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto for their uprising against the Nazis.&quot;

The Russell Tribunal was included by historian Guenter Lewy as part of a &quot;veritable industry publicizing alleged war crimes&quot;, as increasing numbers of American servicemen were stepping forward with published accounts of their experiences with atrocities, and scholars and peace organisations were holding tribunals dealing with war crimes.

Staughton Lynd, chairman of the 1965 &quot;March on Washington&quot;, was asked by Russell to participate in the tribunal and rejected the invitation. Lynd&#x27;s objections and criticism of the Tribunal were based on the fact that Russell planned to investigate only non-North Vietnamese and National Liberation Front conduct. Lynd wrote that &quot;in conversation with the emissary who proffered the invitation, I urged that the alleged war crimes of any party to the conflict should come before the Tribunal. After all, I argued, a &quot;crime&quot; is an action that is wrong no matter who does it. Pressing my case, I asked, &quot;What if it were shown that the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam tortures unarmed prisoners?&quot; The answer, as I understood it, was, &quot;Anything is justified that drives the imperialist aggressor into the sea.&quot; I declined the invitation to be a member of the Tribunal.&quot;

David Horowitz, who did some work for the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation but didn&#x27;t participate in the Tribunal, wrote 30 years later about the criticism that the Russell Tribunal would not also investigate alleged Communist atrocities. In his memoirs, Horowitz wrote that Jean-Paul Sartre said, &quot;I refuse to place in the same category the actions of an organization of poor peasants ... and those of an immense army backed by a highly organized country ...&quot;. Horowitz interpreted Sartre&#x27;s words to mean &quot;the Communists were, by definition, incapable of committing war crimes.&quot;

Judge Richard Goldstone, writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in October 2011, said of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine that &quot;It is not a &#x27;tribunal.&#x27; The &#x27;evidence&#x27; is going to be one-sided and the members of the &#x27;jury&#x27; are critics whose harsh views of Israel are well known. In Israel, there is no apartheid. Nothing there comes close to the definition of apartheid under the 1998 Rome Statute.&quot;

South African journalist and human rights activist Benjamin Pogrund, now living in Israel, described the Cape Town Session of the Russell Tribunal on Palestine as &quot;It&#x27;s theatre: the actors know their parts and the result is known before they start. Israel is to be dragged into the mud.&quot;

After the Cape Town session, Israeli MK Otniel Schneller filed a complaint with the Knesset&#x27;s Ethics Committee against MK Hanin Zoabi, who testified at the Tribunal that &quot;Israel is an apartheid state&quot;.

A group of Jewish South Africans protested against the court, and the organiser of the protest called it a &quot;Kangaroo Court.&quot;

Daniele Archibugi and Alice Pease have argued that it is a rather common practice that those accused of international crimes challenge the impartiality of their accusers. And it may be the case that the organisers of opinion tribunals, as of any other tribunal, might be biased or produce insufficient evidence. But to further develop the rule of law, those which are unsatisfied about the outcomes of these tribunals should be able to produce further evidence and legal arguments rather than unsubstantiated criticism. Legal discourse, they argue, is necessarily based on the opposition of contrasting views.

<text>The FA Amateur Cup was an English football competition for amateur clubs. It commenced in 1893 and ended in 1974 when the Football Association abolished official amateur status.

==History==

Following the legalisation of professionalism within football, professional teams quickly came to dominate the sport&#x27;s main national knock-out tournament, the FA Cup. In response to this, the committee of the country&#x27;s oldest club, Sheffield F.C., suggested in 1892 the organisation of a separate national cup solely for amateur teams, and even offered to pay for the trophy itself. The Football Association (the FA) declined the club&#x27;s offer, but a year later decided to organise just such a competition. N. L. Jackson of Corinthian F.C. was appointed chairman of the Amateur Cup sub-committee and arranged for the purchase of a trophy valued at £30.00, and the first tournament took place during the 1893–94 season. The entrants included 12 clubs representing the old boys of leading public schools, and Old Carthusians, the team for former pupils of Charterhouse School, won the first final, defeating Casuals. The old boy teams competed in the Amateur Cup until 1902, when disputes with the FA led to the formation of the Arthur Dunn Cup, a dedicated competition for such teams.

The 1973-74 competition was the last, as the FA abolished the distinction between professional and amateur clubs. The strongest amateur teams instead entered the FA Trophy, which had been set up five years earlier to cater for those teams outside The Football League which were professional rather than amateur. A new competition, the FA Vase, was set up to cater for the remaining amateur clubs, and was generally regarded as a direct replacement for the old competition.

==Structure==
The first tournament attracted 81 entrants, with three qualifying rounds used to reduce the number down to 32 for the first round proper. For the following season, the previous season&#x27;s semi-finalists joined at the first round proper along with other leading clubs chosen by the FA, with the numbers made up by teams progressing through the qualifying rounds. This remained the standard format until 1907, when the number of entrants to the first round was doubled to 64 and the number of rounds prior to the semi-finals increased to four. The competition continued under this format until it was discontinued in 1974.

==Venues==

Matches in the Amateur Cup were played at the home ground of one of the two teams, as decided when the matches are drawn. Occasionally games were moved to other grounds. In the event of a draw, the replay was played at the ground of the team who originally played away from home. The second replay, and any further replays, were usually played at neutral grounds.

The final was held at various grounds in the early years of the competition, with a venue located somewhere in between the home towns of the two participating clubs usually chosen. In 1949 the final moved to Wembley Stadium, and was then played there every year until the competition ended. In the 1950s attendances for the final reached 100,000, comparable to the FA Cup final itself.

==Winners and finalists==

Almost all of the winners over the years were from either the Isthmian League, based in London and the Home Counties, or the Northern League, based in North East England, with Bishop Auckland the most successful club with 10 wins. Amateur Cup winners who later turned professional and gained entry to the English Football League include Middlesbrough, West Hartlepool (merged to form Hartlepool United), Wimbledon, Wycombe Wanderers and Barnet. Ilford, Leytonstone and Walthamstow Avenue additionally merged to become Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, a professional club which has also competed in the EFL.

Thirty-six different clubs won the cup. The following clubs won the tournament more than once:


*A. Clapton did not play in a league at the time of the club&#x27;s first Amateur Cup win, but played in the Isthmian League at the time of the remaining four victories.

<text>William Andrew White II (June 16, 1874 – September 9, 1936) was a Canadian chaplain and military officer from Nova Scotia who was commissioned as the first black officer in the Canadian Army. He served in World War I as a military chaplain, the only black officer in the Canadian military during the war.

He and his wife had thirteen children, many of whom achieved national distinction. They included classical singer Portia White and politicians Bill White and Jack White. In 1936, White was awarded an honorary doctorate from Acadia University, the first Black Canadian to be given an honorary doctorate.

== Early years ==
White, who like his father went by his middle name, Andrew, was born in 1874 to former slaves in King and Queen County, Virginia. He moved to the city of Baltimore, Maryland, where he lived with his brother and attended Wayland Seminary in Washington. After Helena Blackadar, a Canadian Baptist missionary and school teacher of his, impressed him with descriptions of the province, where freed American slaves had been resettled after the Revolutionary War, White moved to Nova Scotia in 1900. He had imagined this land as his key to freedom. He became the second black man accepted by Acadia University, and in 1903 became its first black graduate. White graduated with an arts degree in theology, and was ordained a Baptist minister. He worked the next two years as a traveling missionary for the African Baptist churches of Nova Scotia.

== Family ==
White met and married Izie Dora White (no relation) of Mill Village, Nova Scotia. She was a descendant of Black Loyalists. Together they raised a family of thirteen children. One of their daughters, Portia White, became a world-famous singer. Son Bill White Jr., became the first Black Canadian to run for federal political office in Canada when he stood as a candidate for the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation in the 1949 federal election. Son Jack, was a noted Canadian labour union activist and the second black candidate to run for office in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

== World War I ==
In 1916, White enlisted in the No. 2 Construction Battalion, an all-black segregated unit serving in World War I. He was the only black chaplain in the Canadian military and was a commissioned officer serving with the rank of Honorary Captain.

== Ministry ==
Following the war, White returned to Halifax and was called to Cornwallis Street Baptist Church. He served as rector for more than 17 years. During the early 1930s, his services were broadcast over the radio every month, and they were heard throughout the Maritimes. He died of pneumonia on September 9, 1936 in Halifax.

==Legacy and honours==
*He was the first black person to be honoured with a Doctorate of Divinity from Acadia.
*White and Izie Dora&#x27;s grandchildren include Senator Donald Oliver, politician and activist Sheila White, and folk musician Chris White. The novelist and playwright George Elliott Clarke is a great-grandson.
*Actor and filmmaker Anthony Sherwood, White&#x27;s great nephew produced a docu-drama entitled, &quot;Honour Before Glory&quot;, based on White&#x27;s diaries while he served in France during the Great War.

<text> (; Archaic English name: Alexander Márai; 11 April 1900 – 21 February 1989) was a Hungarian writer, poet, and journalist.

==Biography==
Márai was born on 11 April 1900 in the city of Kassa, Hungary (now Košice, Slovakia). Through his father, he was a relative of the Hungarian noble Országh family. In 1919, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the Hungarian Soviet Republic and worked as a journalist. He joined the Communists, becoming the founder of the &quot;Activist and Anti-National Group of Communist Writers&quot;. After the fall of the Hungarian Soviet Republic, his family found it safer to leave the country, thus he continued his studies in Leipzig. Márai traveled to and lived in Frankfurt, Berlin, and Paris and briefly considered writing in German, but eventually chose his mother language, Hungarian, for his writings. In &quot;Egy polgár vallomásai&quot; (English: &quot;Confessions of a citizen&quot;), Márai identifies the mother tongue language with the concept of the nation itself. He settled in Krisztinaváros, Budapest, in 1928. In the 1930s, he gained prominence with a precise and clear realist style. He was the first person to write reviews of the work of Franz Kafka.

He wrote very enthusiastically about the First and Second Vienna Awards, in which as the result of the German-Italian arbitration Czechoslovakia and Romania had to give back part of the territories that Hungary lost in the Treaty of Trianon, including his native Kassa (Košice). Nevertheless, Márai was highly critical of the Nazis.

Márai authored 46 books. His 1942 book &quot;Embers&quot; (Hungarian title: &quot;A gyertyák csonkig égnek&quot;, meaning &quot;The Candles Burn Down to the Stump&quot;) expresses a nostalgia for the bygone multi-ethnic, multicultural society of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, reminiscent of the works of Joseph Roth. In 2006 an adaptation of this novel for the stage, written by Christopher Hampton, was performed in London.

He also disliked the communist regime that seized power after World War II, and left – or was driven away – in 1948. After living for some time in Italy, Márai settled in the city of San Diego, in the United States. Márai joined Radio Free Europe between 1951 and 1968. Márai was extremely disappointed in the Western powers for not helping the Hungarian Revolution of 1956.

He continued to write in his native language, but was not published in English until the mid-1990s. Like other memoirs by Hungarian writers and statesmen, his &quot;Föld! Föld!&quot; was first published in the West in 1971, because it could not be published in the Hungary of the post-1956 Kádár era. The English version of this memoir was published posthumously in 2001. After his wife died in 1986, Márai retreated more and more into isolation. In 1987, he lived with advanced cancer and his depression worsened when he lost his adopted son, John. He ended his life with a gunshot to his head in San Diego in 1989. He left behind three granddaughters; Lisa, Sarah and Jennifer Márai.

Largely forgotten outside of Hungary, his work (consisting of poems, novels, and diaries) has only been recently &quot;rediscovered&quot; and republished in French (starting in 1992), Polish, Catalan, Italian, English, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, Danish, Icelandic, Korean, Lithuanian, Dutch, Urdu and other languages too, and is now considered to be part of the 20th-century European literary canon.

==Evaluation==
“Hungarian Sándor Márai was the insightful chronicler of a collapsing world.&quot; – Le Monde

&quot;It is perhaps one of the [works that] thus impacted me a lot.&quot; – Dilma Rousseff on the book &quot;Embers&quot;.

<text>The Alma Mater Society of Queen&#x27;s University, otherwise known as the AMS, is the central undergraduate student association at Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. It is the oldest organization of its kind in Canada. Its roots lie in the old Dialectic Society (now known as the Queen&#x27;s Debating Union), which created the AMS in 1858. The society seeks to represent and facilitate the student experience, whether it is through a multitude of clubs, services, governance or volunteer opportunities.

An umbrella organization, the AMS each year hires over 500 student employees and 1500 volunteers, as it works with member faculty societies to offer resources, services, support, and opportunities to Queen&#x27;s students.

==Structure and organization==

===AMS Assembly===
The Society&#x27;s ultimate authority lies with the AMS Assembly, which is composed of elected representatives from each of the nine member faculty societies (Arts and Science, Engineering and Applied Science, Concurrent Education, M.B.A., Commerce, Nursing, Medicine, Physical and Health Education, and Computing, Health Sciences Society as well as non-voting representatives of the Residence Society. Other Ex-Officio members that sit on assembly include the AMS Commissioners, the University Rector, Undergraduate Trustee, Board of Directors Chair, and the AMS Secretariat.

The Assembly is the premier student democratic body of both the Society and the University. It holds bi-annual referendums and annual elections to affirm representatives, approve or change student fees, and even gather student approval for different initiatives and plans. The referendums and elections are bolstered by an Annual General Meeting or AGM, typically held in March, which contains a broad agenda of student issues and opens voting to any current students in attendance. Assembly is managed by the AMS Secretary.

===AMS Executive===
The three-person AMS Executive oversee the student society&#x27;s general operations and representation. The executive is elected annually in January as a slate with the positions of AMS President, Vice-President (Operations) &amp; CEO, and Vice-President (University Affairs). Responsibilities are generally divided along the lines of the corporate and government sides of the AMS, with the VP University Affairs overseeing the five commissions and two of the three Government Offices, the VP Operations managing three student directors and their many corporate services, and the President responsible for managing four Offices, representing the Society and liaising with the administration. The executive is elected for a one-year term of service lasting from May 1 to April 30.

===AMS Executive Team===
The day-to-day operations of the AMS are overseen by the AMS Executive Team (formerly known as the &quot;AMS Council&quot;) which includes the three-person AMS Executive, four commissioners, one government director, four services directors, and four office directors. The Executive Team is responsible for the operational implementation of AMS objectives from year to year, with major decisions being made in regard to service operation, stances on advocacy and causes (including representation to the provincial government through OUSA), and general management of their portfolios.

===Commissions===
The five Commissioners on the Executive Team each oversee their own Commission, which form the bulk of the &quot;government side&quot; of the AMS government. The Commissions are responsible for the organization and oversight of a variety of student programs, activities, community initiatives, external representation, and social causes. As of the 2017/2018 academic year, the Commissions are: (1) External Affairs, (2) Campus Affairs, (3) Environmental Sustainability, (4) Clubs, and (5) Social Issues.

After the Commission of Environmental Sustainability was dissolved in 2016–17, it was brought back in 2020-21 by the executive.

===Offices===
Five Offices exist, five of which report to the AMS President. Four of these offices are overseen by the Directors of:

* Human Resources
* Communications
* Marketing
* The Student Life Centre

In addition, as of the 2017/2018 academic year, the Office of the Secretariat also falls under the President&#x27;s portfolio; the Secretary oversees elections and referendums, as well as the administrative functioning of the AMS Assembly. With the change, Judicial Affairs now fall under the Office. Led by the Judicial Affairs Manager, is one half of the AMS&#x27;s peer-administered system of restorative, non-academic discipline. (The other half, the Judicial Committee, shares resources with the Office of the Secretariat, but is otherwise constitutionally separated from any Office or Commission in order to ensure independence.)

===Services===
The Vice President (Operations) manages the AMS&#x27; Services. This includes:

* Common Ground Coffeehouse
* Queen&#x27;s Student Constables (QSC or &quot;StuCons&quot;)
* Printing &amp; Copy Centre (P&amp;CC)

==History==
The AMS was formed as an offshoot of the Dialectic Society, the precursor to the Queen&#x27;s Debating Union. It split off to form an independent organization in 1858.

The AMS has banned its members from joining externally-affiliated fraternities and sororities since 1933. While fraternities do exist in the Kingston area, the restriction prevents them from recruiting on-campus or affiliating themselves with the University.

The AMS was incorporated in 1969 as a non-profit organization without share capital; the Assembly representatives also serve as the voting members of the corporation, and they annually elect a Board of Directors that oversees the services and financial affairs of the Society. These affairs currently have an annual operations budget of approximately $20 million.

At its inception, the AMS represented all students attending Queen&#x27;s University. However, that changed in 1981 when the Graduate Students&#x27; Society (GSS), an AMS member society formed in 1962, voted by referendum to secede from the AMS. This secession developed out of a conflict around graduate student representation, student services, policy positions, and other issues. In the 1990s, the AMS saw the Theological Society and the Law Students&#x27; Society also leave the AMS - the latter over a dispute regarding student constables - to join the GSS. Through an amendment to its constitution and by-laws, the GSS was renamed the Queen&#x27;s University Society of Graduate and Professional Students, in order to recognize the membership of professional students, including law, divinity, and occupational health students.

In January 2009, the Education Students Society (ESS) voted to leave the AMS, primarily over a debate regarding fees.

==Representation==
The AMS currently represents approximately 18,000 students, each of whom becomes a member of the Society upon paying the mandatory student activity fee along with their tuition. Membership in the AMS is mandatory for those in full-time study in one of the AMS-constituent faculties. The AMS represents undergraduate and full-time MBA students.

Today, the AMS seeks to enhance both the academic and extracurricular experience of its members while fostering connections with the surrounding community.

Provincially, the AMS is a founding member of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance (OUSA), and thus initially became a member at its foundation 1992; however, the AMS left the organization in 1995. In 2004, the AMS rejoined OUSA as full members, after a number of years as associate observers.

Federally, the AMS joined the Canadian Alliance of Student Associations (CASA) in 2009 on a one-year associate membership basis. The one-year associate member status expired without renewal in 2010. In 2015, the AMS joined several other student associations from U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities schools in forming the Undergraduates of Canadian Research Intensive Universities.

<text>A plain bearing, or more commonly sliding contact bearing and slide bearing (in railroading sometimes called a solid bearing, journal bearing, or friction bearing), is the simplest type of bearing, comprising just a bearing surface and no rolling elements. Therefore, of the shaft in contact with the bearing slides over the bearing surface. The simplest example of a plain bearing is a shaft rotating in a hole. A simple linear bearing can be a pair of flat surfaces designed to allow motion; e.g., a drawer and the slides it rests on or the ways on the bed of a lathe.

Plain bearings, in general, are the least expensive type of bearing. They are also compact and lightweight, and they have a high load-carrying capacity.

== Design ==
The design of a plain bearing depends on the type of motion the bearing must provide. The three types of motions possible are:

* &quot;Journal&quot; (&quot;friction&quot;, &quot;radial&quot; or &quot;rotary&quot;) &quot;bearing&quot;: This is the most common type of plain bearing; it is simply a shaft rotating in a hole. In locomotive and railroad car applications a &quot;journal bearing&quot; specifically referred to the plain bearing once used at the ends of the axles of railroad wheel sets, enclosed by axleboxes (also called &quot;journal boxes&quot;). Axlebox bearings today are rolling-element bearings rather than plain bearings.
* &quot;Linear bearing&quot;: This bearing provides linear motion; it may take the form of a circular bearing and shaft or any other two mating surfaces (e.g., a slide plate).
* &quot;Thrust bearing&quot;: A thrust bearing provides a bearing surface for forces acting axial to the shaft. One example is a propeller shaft.

=== Integral ===

&quot;Integral&quot; plain bearings are built into the object of use as a hole prepared in the bearing surface. Industrial integral bearings are usually made from cast iron or babbitt, and a hardened steel shaft is used in the bearing.

Integral bearings are not as common because bushings are easier to accommodate and can be replaced if necessary. Depending on the material, an integral bearing may be less expensive but it cannot be replaced. If an integral bearing wears out, the item may be replaced or reworked to accept a bushing. Integral bearings were very common in 19th-century machinery, but became progressively less common as interchangeable manufacture became popular.

For example, a common integral plain bearing is the hinge, which is both a thrust bearing and a journal bearing.

=== Bushing ===

A &quot;bushing&quot;, also known as a &quot;bush&quot;, is an independent plain bearing that is inserted into a housing to provide a bearing surface for rotary applications; this is the most common form of a plain bearing. Common designs include &quot;solid&quot; (&quot;sleeve&quot; and &quot;flanged&quot;), &quot;split&quot;, and &quot;clenched&quot; bushings. A sleeve, split, or clenched bushing is only a &quot;sleeve&quot; of material with an inner diameter (ID), outer diameter (OD), and length. The difference between the three types is that a solid sleeved bushing is solid all the way around, a split bushing has a cut along its length, and a clenched bearing is similar to a split bushing but with a (or ) across the cut connecting the parts. A flanged bushing is a sleeve bushing with a flange at one end extending radially outward from the OD. The flange is used to positively locate the bushing when it is installed or to provide a thrust bearing surface.

Sleeve bearings of inch dimensions are almost exclusively dimensioned using the SAE numbering system. The numbering system uses the format -XXYY-ZZ, where XX is the ID in sixteenths of an inch, YY is the OD in sixteenths of an inch, and ZZ is the length in eighths of an inch. Metric sizes also exist.

A linear bushing is not usually pressed into a housing, but rather secured with a radial feature. Two such examples include two retaining rings, or a ring that is molded onto the OD of the bushing that matches with a groove in the housing. This is usually a more durable way to retain the bushing, because the forces acting on the bushing could press it out. Flanged bushings are designed for enhanced resistance to both radial and axial loads.

The thrust form of a bushing is conventionally called a &quot;&quot;.

=== Two-piece ===

&quot;Two-piece&quot; plain bearings, known as &quot;full bearings&quot; in industrial machinery, are commonly used for larger diameters, such as crankshaft bearings. The two halves are called &quot;shells&quot;. There are various systems used to keep the shells located. The most common method is a tab on the parting line edge that correlates with a notch in the housing to prevent axial movement after installation. For large, thick shells a button stop or dowel pin is used. The button stop is screwed to the housing, while the dowel pin keys the two shells together. Another less common method uses a dowel pin that keys the shell to the housing through a hole or slot in the shell.

The distance from one parting edge to the other is slightly larger than the corresponding distance in the housing so that a light amount of pressure is required to install the bearing. This keeps the bearing in place as the two halves of the housing are installed. Finally, the shell&#x27;s circumference is also slightly larger than the housing circumference so that when the two halves are bolted together the bearing &quot;crushes&quot; slightly. This creates a large amount of radial force around the entire bearing, which keeps it from &quot;spinning&quot;. It also forms a good interface for heat to travel out of the bearings into the housing.

== Materials ==

Plain bearings must be made from a material that is durable, low friction, low wear to the bearing and shaft, resistant to elevated temperatures, and corrosion resistant. Often the bearing is made up of at least two constituents, where one is soft and the other is hard. The hard constituent supports the load while the soft constituent supports the hard constituent. In general, the harder the surfaces in contact the lower the coefficient of friction and the greater the pressure required for the two to gall or to seize when lubrication fails.

=== Babbitt ===
Babbitt is usually used in integral bearings. It is coated over the bore, usually to a thickness of , depending on the diameter. Babbitt is made using soft material when compared to the material of composition of the journal or the rotating shaft. Babbitt bearings are designed to not damage the journal during direct contact and to collect any contaminants in the lubrication.

=== Bi-material ===

Bi-material bearings consist of two materials, a metal shell and a plastic bearing surface. Common combinations include a steel-backed PTFE-coated bronze and aluminum-backed Frelon. Steel-backed PTFE-coated bronze bearings are rated for more load than most other bi-metal bearings and are used for rotary and oscillating motions. Aluminum-backed Frelon are commonly used in corrosive environments because the Frelon is chemically inert.

=== Bronze ===

A common plain bearing design utilizes a hardened and polished steel shaft and a softer bronze bushing. The bushing is replaced whenever it has worn too much.

Common bronze alloys used for bearings include: SAE 841, SAE 660 (CDA 932), SAE 863, and CDA 954.

=== Cast iron ===

A cast iron bearing can be used with a hardened steel shaft because the coefficient of friction is relatively low. The cast iron glazes over therefore wear becomes negligible.

=== Graphite ===

In harsh environments, such as ovens and dryers, a copper and graphite alloy, commonly known by the trademarked name graphalloy, is used. The graphite is a dry lubricant, therefore it is low friction and low maintenance. The copper adds strength, durability, and provides heat dissipation characteristics.

Unalloyed graphite bearings are used in special applications, such as locations that are submerged in water.

=== Jewels ===
Known as &quot;jewel bearings&quot;, these bearings use jewels, such as sapphire, ruby, and garnet.

=== Plastic ===

Solid plastic plain bearings are now increasingly popular due to dry-running lubrication-free behavior. Solid polymer plain bearings are low weight, corrosion resistant, and maintenance free. After studies spanning decades, an accurate calculation of the service life of polymer plain bearings is possible today. Designing with solid polymer plain bearings is complicated by the wide range, and non-linearity, of coefficient of thermal expansion. These materials can heat rapidly when used in applications outside the recommended pV limits.

Solid polymer type bearings are limited by the injection molding process. Not all shapes are possible with this process, and shapes that are possible are limited to what is considered good design practice for injection molding. Plastic bearings are subject to the same design cautions as all other plastic parts: creep, high thermal expansion, softening (increased wear/reduced life) at elevated temperature, brittle fractures at cold temperatures, and swelling due to moisture absorption. While most bearing-grade plastics/polymers are designed to reduce these design cautions, they still exist and should be carefully considered before specifying a solid polymer (plastic) type.

Plastic bearings are now quite common, including usage in photocopy machines, tills, farm equipment, textile machinery, medical devices, food and packaging machines, car seating, and marine equipment.

Common plastics include nylon, polyacetal, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), rulon, PEEK, urethane, and vespel (a high-performance polyimide).

* MDS (molybdenum disulfide)
** PEEK (polyether ether ketone)

=== Others ===

* Igus, iglidur: Specially developed polymer bearing materials with life prediction
* Ceramic bearings are very hard, so sand and other grit that enters the bearing are simply ground to a fine powder that does not inhibit the operation of the bearing.
* Lubrite
* Lignum vitae is a self lubricating wood and in clocks it gives extremely long life. Also used with bronze wheels in ship rigging.
* In a piano, various (usually) wooden parts of the keyboard and action are linked together by center pins typically made of German silver. These linkages usually have felt, or more rarely, leather bushings.
* Aluminum alloys can be used for low load applications

== Lubrication ==

The types of lubrication system can be categorized into three groups:

* &quot;Class I&quot;: bearings that require the application of a lubricant from an external source (e.g., oil, grease, etc.).
* &quot;Class II&quot;: bearings that contain a lubricant within the walls of the bearing (e.g., bronze, graphite, etc.). Typically these bearings require an outside lubricant to achieve maximum performance.
* &quot;Class III&quot;: bearings made of materials that are the lubricant. These bearings are typically considered &quot;self-lubricating&quot; and can run without an external lubricant.

Examples of the second type of bearing are Oilites and plastic bearings made from polyacetal; examples of the third type are metalized graphite bearings and PTFE bearings.

Most plain bearings have a plain inner surface; however, some are grooved, such as spiral groove bearing. The grooves help lubrication enter the bearing and cover the whole journal.

Self-lubricating plain bearings have a lubricant contained within the bearing walls. There are many forms of self-lubricating bearings. The first, and most common, are sintered metal bearings, which have porous walls. The porous walls draw oil in via capillary action and release the oil when pressure or heat is applied. An example of a sintered metal bearing in action can be seen in self-lubricating chains, which require no additional lubrication during operation. Another form is a solid one-piece metal bushing with a groove channel on the inner diameter that is filled with graphite. A similar bearing replaces the figure eight groove with holes plugged with graphite. This lubricates the bearing inside and out. The last form is a plastic bearing, which has the lubricant molded into the bearing. The lubricant is released as the bearing is run in.

There are three main types of lubrication: &quot;full-film condition&quot;, &quot;boundary condition&quot;, and &quot;dry condition&quot;. Full-film conditions are when the bearing&#x27;s load is carried solely by a film of fluid lubricant and there is no contact between the two bearing surfaces. In mix or boundary conditions, load is carried partly by direct surface contact and partly by a film forming between the two. In a dry condition, the full load is carried by surface-to-surface contact.

Bearings that are made from bearing grade materials always run in the dry condition. The other two classes of plain bearings can run in all three conditions; the condition in which a bearing runs is dependent on the operating conditions, load, relative surface speed, clearance within the bearing, quality and quantity of lubricant, and temperature (affecting lubricant viscosity). If the plain bearing is not designed to run in the dry or boundary condition, it has a high coefficient of friction and wears out. Dry and boundary conditions may be experienced even in a fluid bearing when operating outside of its normal operating conditions; e.g., at startup and shutdown.

=== Fluid lubrication ===

Fluid lubrication results in a full-film or a boundary condition lubrication mode. A properly designed bearing system reduces friction by eliminating surface-to-surface contact between the journal and bearing through fluid dynamic effects.

Fluid bearings can be &quot;hydrostatically&quot; or &quot;hydrodynamically&quot; lubricated. Hydrostatically lubricated bearings are lubricated by an external pump that maintains a &quot;static&quot; amount of pressure. In a hydrodynamic bearing the pressure in the oil film is maintained by the rotation of the journal. Hydrostatic bearings enter a &quot;hydrodynamic state&quot; when the journal is rotating. Hydrostatic bearings usually use oil, while hydrodynamic bearings can use oil or grease, however bearings can be designed to use whatever fluid is available, and several pump designs use the pumped fluid as a lubricant.

Hydrodynamic bearings require greater care in design and operation than hydrostatic bearings. They are also more prone to initial wear because lubrication does not occur until there is rotation of the shaft. At low rotational speeds the lubrication may not attain complete separation between shaft and bushing. As a result, hydrodynamic bearings may be aided by secondary bearings that support the shaft during start and stop periods, protecting the fine tolerance machined surfaces of the journal bearing. On the other hand, hydrodynamic bearings are simpler to install and are less expensive.

In the hydrodynamic state a lubrication &quot;wedge&quot; forms, which lifts the journal. The journal also slightly shifts horizontally in the direction of rotation. The location of the journal is measured by the &quot;attitude angle&quot;, which is the angle formed between the vertical and a line that crosses through the center of the journal and the center of the bearing, and the eccentricity ratio, which is the ratio of the distance of the centre of the journal from the centre of the bearing, to the overall radial clearance. The attitude angle and eccentricity ratio are dependent on the direction and speed of rotation and the load. In hydrostatic bearings the oil pressure also affects the eccentricity ratio. In electromagnetic equipment like motors, electromagnetic forces can counteract gravity loads, causing the journal to take up unusual positions.

One disadvantage specific to fluid-lubricated, hydrodynamic journal bearings in high-speed machinery is &quot;oil whirl&quot;—a self-excited vibration of the journal. Oil whirl occurs when the lubrication wedge becomes unstable: small disturbances of the journal result in reaction forces from the oil film, which cause further movement, causing both the oil film and the journal to &quot;whirl&quot; around the bearing shell. Typically the whirl frequency is around 42% of the journal turning speed. In extreme cases oil whirl leads to direct contact between the journal and the bearing, which quickly wears out the bearing. In some cases the frequency of the whirl coincides with and &quot;locks on to&quot; the critical speed of the machine shaft; this condition is known as &quot;oil whip&quot;. Oil whip can be very destructive.

Oil whirl can be prevented by a stabilising force applied to the journal. A number of bearing designs seek to use bearing geometry to either provide an obstacle to the whirling fluid or to provide a stabilising load to minimize whirl. One such is called the &quot;lemon bore&quot; or &quot;elliptical bore&quot;. In this design, shims are installed between the two halves of the bearing housing and then the bore is machined to size. After the shims are removed, the bore resembles a lemon shape, which decreases the clearance in one direction of the bore and increases the pre-load in that direction. The disadvantage of this design is its lower load carrying capacity, as compared to typical journal bearings. It is also still susceptible to oil whirl at high speeds, however its cost is relatively low.

Another design is the &quot;pressure dam&quot; or &quot;dammed groove&quot;, which has a shallow relief cut in the center of the bearing over the top half of the bearing. The groove abruptly stops in order to create a downward force to stabilize the journal. This design has a high load capacity and corrects most oil whirl situations. The disadvantage is that it only works in one direction. Offsetting the bearing halves does the same thing as the pressure dam. The only difference is the load capacity increases as the offset increases.

A more radical design is the tilting-pad design, which uses multiple pads that are designed to move with changing loads. It is usually used in very large applications but also finds extensive application in modern turbomachinery because it almost completely eliminates oil whirl.

<text>William Rufus Day (April 17, 1849 – July 9, 1923) was an American diplomat and jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1903 to 1922. Prior to his service on the Supreme Court, Day served as United States Secretary of State during the administration of President William McKinley. He also served as a United States circuit judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Sixth Circuit.

==Early life and career==
William Rufus Day was born on April 17, 1849, in Ravenna, Ohio, one of the children of Emily (née Spaulding) and Judge Luther Day of the Ohio Supreme Court. His maternal grandfather Rufus P. Spalding was also a judge of the Ohio Supreme Court. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Michigan in 1870, spent a year studying law with attorney and Judge George F. Robinson, and then a year at the University of Michigan Law School. He was admitted to the bar on July 5, 1872, and settled in Canton, Ohio, where he began practicing law in partnership with William A. Lynch. For twenty-five years, Day worked as a criminal defense and corporate lawyer in the growing industrial town while participating in Republican politics.

During these years, Day became a good friend of William McKinley. Day became McKinley&#x27;s legal and political adviser during McKinley&#x27;s candidacies for the Congress, the Governorship of Ohio, and the Presidency of the United States. After he won the Presidency, McKinley appointed Day to be Assistant Secretary of State under Secretary of State John Sherman. Sherman was considered to be ineffective because of declining health and failing memory, and in 1898, President McKinley replaced Sherman with Day.

Five months later, Day vacated his cabinet position to helm the United States Peace Commission formed to negotiate an end to the Spanish–American War with Spain. After the Spanish–American War was declared, Day had argued that the Spanish colonies, other than Cuba, should be returned to Spain, contrary to McKinley&#x27;s decision that the United States should take over from Spain control of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Day, however, negotiated peace with Spain on McKinley&#x27;s harsher terms. Day was worried the terms McKinley was insisting on would be &quot;humiliating&quot; to Spain, and for that reason Spain would not agree to them. Ultimately Spain did submit to McKinley&#x27;s &quot;painfully harsh&quot; terms. His final diplomatic effort was to lead the United States Peace Commission to Paris and sign the treaty ending the war. He was succeeded at the Department of State by John Hay.

==Court of Appeals and Circuit Courts service==
Day received a recess appointment from President Benjamin Harrison to the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on May 24, 1889, but declined the appointment.

Day was nominated by President William McKinley on February 25, 1899, to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and the United States Circuit Courts for the Sixth Circuit, to a new joint seat authorized by . He was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 28, 1899, and received his commission the same day. His service terminated on February 23, 1903, due to his elevation to the United States Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court service==
On February 19, 1903, Day was nominated by President Theodore Roosevelt as an associate justice of the Supreme Court, to succeed George Shiras Jr. Roosevelt had initially offered the position to William Howard Taft, who declined in order to remain in his post as governor of the Philippines. The United States Senate confirmed the nomination on February 23, 1903, and Day took the judicial oath of office on March 2, 1903. He served as Circuit Justice for the Seventh Circuit from March 9, 1903, to March 17, 1912, and as Circuit Justice for the Sixth Circuit from March 18, 1912, to November 13, 1922.

===Notable cases===
Day wrote 439 opinions during his tenure on the court, of which only 18 were dissents. He distrusted large corporations and voted with antitrust majorities throughout his time on the court. He sided with the government in the Standard Oil, American Tobacco, and Union Pacific cases in 1911 and 1912 and again in the Southern Pacific case in 1922.

Day delivered the opinion of the Court in &quot;Weeks v. United States&quot;, where the highest Court ruled that the warrantless seizure of documents from a private home violated the Fourth Amendment prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures, and evidence obtained in this manner is excluded from use in federal criminal prosecutions.

After the death of Chief Justice Edward Douglass White, Day proposed to President (and fellow Ohioan) Warren G. Harding a plan to crown his legal career by appointing him chief justice and serve for six months before retiring and letting former president William Howard Taft become chief justice. Harding considered the proposal but Taft felt, when he learned of this plan, that a short-term appointment would not serve the office well, and that once confirmed by the Senate, the memory of Day would grow dim.

===Baseball===
Day was an avid baseball fan. He would often leave the Court after oral argument and go straight to Boundary Field to watch the Washington Senators play. Day is recorded as asking his clerk for &quot;regular updates&quot; during the bench hearing of &quot;Standard Sanitary Mfg. Co. v. United States&quot; about the final game of the 1912 World Series.

==Retirement and death==

Day retired from the court on November 13, 1922, and briefly served as an Umpire of the Mixed Claims Commission to Adjudicate War Claims against Germany. He died on July 9, 1923, in his home in the Annex (now named Day Cottage) on Mackinac Island in Michigan, aged 74. He was interred at West Lawn Cemetery in Canton.

==Personal life==

Day married Mary Elizabeth Schaefer, daughter of Louis Schaefer, of Canton on August 24, 1875. They were married until her death in 1912, and were the parents of four sons: William L., Rufus S., Stephen A., and Luther. His sons were appellate lawyers who litigated cases before the Supreme Court. Through his son Luther, he is the great-great grandfather of the actress Anna Gunn.

==Selected opinions authored by Day==

<doc id="627360" wikidata="Q563326" url="?curid=627360" title="Fab Morvan">
<text>Fabrice Maxime Sylvain Morvan (born 14 May 1966) is a French singer, dancer, rapper, and model who was half of the pop duo Milli Vanilli, along with Rob Pilatus. It was later revealed that the two had not actually sung on any of their recordings. After the scandal, the group reformed as Rob &amp; Fab in the 1990s, with limited success. Morvan had a solo comeback in the 2000s, releasing the album &quot;Love Revolution&quot; in 2003.

As of 2023, Morvan resides in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Morvan was born in 1966 in Paris, France, to parents from Pointe-à-Pitre, Guadeloupe. At 18, he moved to Germany, where he worked as a dancer and model and was influenced by funk, soul, hip hop, and pop music. He met Rob Pilatus in a nightclub in Munich, and they decided to form a rock/soul group.

===Milli Vanilli===
Morvan and Pilatus were noticed by music producer Frank Farian, who signed them as part of a musical act called Milli Vanilli. The duo served as the public faces for singers Charles Shaw, John Davis, and Brad Howell, whom Farian thought were talented musicians but lacked a marketable image.

The first Milli Vanilli album, titled &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;, was released in 1989 and proved popular worldwide. It had four hit singles: the title track, &quot;Girl I&#x27;m Gonna Miss You&quot;, &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Forget My Number&quot;, and &quot;Blame It on the Rain&quot;. The group won a Grammy Award for Best New Artist on 22 February 1990 for &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;.

Morvan and Pilatus were frequent targets of rumors and allegations of onstage lip-synching and not having sung on the album. The same year the group released their debut album, Shaw told a reporter the truth but recanted after Farian paid him $155,000 to do so.

When Morvan and Pilatus pressured Farian to let them sing on the next album, Farian then revealed the truth about their lip-synching to reporters on 15 November 1990. As a result, Milli Vanilli&#x27;s Grammy was withdrawn four days later, while Arista Records dropped the act from its roster and deleted their album and its masters from their catalogue, thus making &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; the largest-selling album to ever be deleted. A court ruling allowed any American who bought the album to get a partial refund.

Farian later attempted a failed comeback for the group without Morvan and Pilatus, releasing the album &quot;The Moment of Truth&quot; in February 1991, with new cover art featuring the actual session musicians.

===Aftermath===
Months later, Morvan and Pilatus parodied the scandal in a commercial for Carefree sugarless gum. In it, the duo lip syncs to an opera recording. An announcer asks, &quot;How long does the taste of Carefree sugarless gum last?&quot; The record then begins to skip, and the announcer answers, &quot;until these guys sing themselves&quot;.

Morvan and Pilatus then moved to Los Angeles, where they released an eponymous album under the name &quot;Rob &amp; Fab&quot; in 1993. Only around 2,000 copies were sold. On 26 March 2007, the Milli Vanilli compilation &quot;Best of the Best&quot; was released.

===Solo comeback===
In 2003, Morvan released his first solo album, &quot;Love Revolution&quot;, producing, recording, writing, and singing on all the tracks. On 14 April 2011, he issued the single &quot;Anytime&quot; to digital outlets. On 25 May 2012, he released the single &quot;See the Light&quot; with a new band, Fabulous Addiction.

In 2016, Morvan appeared in a documentary-style KFC commercial that focused on his life and music career after Milli Vanilli.

On 1 November 2022, he appeared in an ad/trailer for the Ryan Reynolds and Will Ferrell-led Christmas comedy &quot;Spirited&quot;. In it, Reynolds and Ferrell are trying to dispel rumors that they lip synched in the film. The audience, however, notices that the actors&#x27; voices don&#x27;t sound quite right. The camera then cuts to a shot of Morvan in a recording studio booth, providing voiceovers.

===Film projects===
On 14 February 2007, it was announced that Universal Pictures was developing a film based on the true story of Milli Vanilli&#x27;s rise and fall in the music industry. Jeff Nathanson, a screenwriter known for &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, was to write and direct. Morvan was supposed to serve as a consultant, providing his and Pilatus&#x27;s points of view. However, the project was never completed. In 2011 German director Florian Gallenberger declared that he was reviving it and would be rewriting the script. This ultimately didn&#x27;t happen.

Director Brett Ratner attempted to make his version of a Milli Vanilli biopic, for which Morvan sold his exclusive life rights to Ratner&#x27;s production company, RatPac Entertainment, but the project was cancelled in 2021, after numerous Time&#x27;s Up sexual harassment allegations against Ratner became public.

Between 2021 and 2022, Simon Verhoeven directed and wrote the Milli Vanilli biopic &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;, which was filmed in Munich, Berlin, Cape Town, and Los Angeles. It was produced by Wiedemann &amp; Berg Film, with Leonine as the theatrical distributor. The movie stars Tijan Njie and Elan Ben Ali as Pilatus and Morvan, as well as Matthias Schweighöfer as Farian. One of the executive producers is R&amp;B music producer and performer Kevin Liles, who composed the original version of &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot; in 1986. Associate producers are Jasmin Davis, daughter of John Davis, and Brad Howell. Carmen Pilatus, sister of Rob Pilatus, Milli Vanilli&#x27;s former assistant Todd Headlee, and Ingrid Segieth a.k.a. Milli, are also attached as associate producers. After Ratner&#x27;s project was officially cancelled, Morvan could also join the co-producers&#x27; ranks of &quot;Girl You Know It&#x27;s True&quot;. He attended the world premiere in Munich on 4 December 2023 and even performed the title song at the Bavarian Film Awards on 19 January 2024 together with Tijan Njie and Elan Ben Ali. The feature won Best Film.

&quot;Milli Vanilli&quot; documentary
On 13 March 2021, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that a feature documentary was in the works, directed by Luke Korem and produced by Korem, Bradley Jackson, Keep on Running Pictures, and MRC.

On 1 June 2023, it was announced that Paramount+ had acquired the film, titled &quot;Milli Vanilli&quot;. The feature premiered at the Tribeca Festival on 10 June 2023. It received positive critical reviews, including &quot;Variety&quot; calling it a &quot;captivating and moving documentary&quot; and saying that it &quot;brings off something at once strategic, artful, and humane&quot;. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; released a trailer on 13 September 2023, and announced the film would have a global release on 24 October.

==Personal life==
In January 2024, Morvan&#x27;s wife, Kim Marlowe, filed for divorce in the Los Angeles Superior Court. Details regarding the couple&#x27;s marriage are unknown. Marlowe was described by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in September 1997 as Morvan&#x27;s &quot;best friend and manager&quot;. Morvan has four children with his partner Tessa van der Steen, with whom he resides in Amsterdam.

<text>Maria Gay (12 June 1876 – 29 July 1943) was a Catalan opera singer, a mezzo-soprano born as Maria de Lourdes Lucia Antonia Pichot Gironés. She has sometimes been referred to as Maria Gay Zenatello.

==Biography==
According to one story, young Maria was arrested for singing revolutionary or nationalist songs. She defiantly continued to sing them in prison, with a voice so fine she was offered a chance to study bel canto. She was a singing pupil of soprano Ada Adini.

In 1897, she married the Catalan composer , with whom she had two daughters and a son, all of whom died young: her daughters of illness as teenagers and her son in the war.

In 1902, she debuted in the title role of &quot;Carmen&quot; in Brussels. She was a hit in the role and became one of the best regarded interpreters of &quot;Carmen&quot; of her era. She reportedly shocked and mesmerized audiences, portraying the gypsy girl as an impudent, magnetic, but coarse and unrefined peasant, eating an orange and spitting out the seeds before singing the famous Habanera.

In 1906, she debuted at Milan&#x27;s La Scala, where she met tenor Giovanni Zenatello. Gay and Zenatello would live together the rest of their lives, and were often described as husband and wife, although they may never actually have gotten married, and legally Maria Gay may still have been married to Joan Gay Planella until his death in 1926. In 1908, she made her debut in &quot;Carmen&quot; for the Met in New York City opposite Geraldine Farrar as Micaela. In 1910 she performed the same role with the Boston Opera Company as Carmen.

She made a series of gramophone records for the Columbia Phonograph Company.

Gay and Zenatello worked to find, help train, and promote promising young singers. Their most famous find was Lily Pons, who the couple managed until Pons and the couple had a falling-out.

Gay and Zenatello set up a home in Manhattan, New York City in 1936, where she lived the rest of her life. She died on 20 July 1943. Maria Gay was buried in Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.

<doc id="627366" wikidata="Q1408708" url="?curid=627366" title="Flexure bearing">
<text>A flexure bearing is a category of flexure which is engineered to be compliant in one or more angular degrees of freedom. Flexure bearings are often part of compliant mechanisms. Flexure bearings serve much of the same function as conventional bearings or hinges in applications which require angular compliance. However, flexures require no lubrication and exhibit very low or no friction.

Many flexure bearings are made of a single part: two rigid structures joined by a thin &quot;hinge&quot; area. A hinged door can be created by implementing a flexible element between a door and the door frame, such that the flexible element bends allowing the door to pivot open.

Flexure bearings have the advantage over most other bearings that they are simple and thus inexpensive. They are also often compact, lightweight, have very low friction, and are easier to repair without specialized equipment. Flexure bearings have the disadvantages that the range of motion is limited, and often very limited for bearings that support high loads.

A flexure bearing relies on the bearing element being made of a material which can be repeatedly flexed without disintegrating. However, most materials lose strength and eventually fail with repeated flexing and bending. For example, most metals will fatigue with repeated flexing, and will eventually snap. Thus, one part of flexure bearing design is the careful consideration of material properties to avoid fatigue with normal use.

Flexure bearings can give very low friction and also give very predictable friction. Many other bearings rely on sliding or rolling motions (rolling-element bearings), which are necessarily uneven because the bearing surfaces are never perfectly flat. A flexure bearing operates by bending of materials, which causes motion at microscopic level, so friction is very uniform. For this reason, flexure bearings are often used in sensitive precision measuring equipment.
Many types of flexure bearings are not limited to low loads, however. For example, the drive shafts of some sports cars replace cardan universal joints with an equivalent joint called a rag joint which works by bending rubberized fabric. The resulting joint is lighter yet is capable of carrying hundreds of kilowatts, with adequate durability for a sports car. 

Because flexure bearings do not rely on sliding or rolling motions, they do not require lubrication. Consequently, they can be employed in abrasive environments and environments hostile to lubricants: underwater, in a vacuum and at elevated temperatures.

<text>John Watson Foster (March 2, 1836 – November 15, 1917) was an American diplomat and military officer, as well as a lawyer and journalist. His highest public office was U.S. secretary of state under Benjamin Harrison, although he also proved influential as a lawyer in technically private practice in the international relations sphere.

==Early life==

Foster was born on March 2, 1836, in Petersburg, Indiana, and raised in Evansville, Indiana. He was the son of Matthew Watson Foster, an Indiana farmer, merchant, and judge, and the former Eleanor Johnson. He graduated from the fledgling Indiana University Bloomington in 1855, but decided not to become a preacher as his parents hoped. Instead, Foster attended Harvard Law School, then moved to Cincinnati, Ohio, to begin his legal career.

In 1861, Foster volunteered in the Union Army in the American Civil War. Initially commissioned as a major, he rose to the rank of colonel, serving with the 25th Indiana Volunteer Infantry, the 65th Indiana Volunteer Mounted Infantry and the 136th Indiana Volunteer Infantry. Foster&#x27;s troops became the first to enter Knoxville, Tennessee, after the successful campaign by General Ambrose Burnside.

Foster was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States - a military society of officers who had served in the Union armed forces during the Civil War.

After the war, Foster returned to Indiana and (in addition to his legal practice) edited the &quot;Evansville Daily Journal&quot;. He used the paper to promote the Republican Party from 1865 to 1869.

==Washington career==
Foster moved to Washington, D.C., under President Ulysses S. Grant, and had a summer home in Henderson Harbor, New York. As a reward for his political service after the Republican Party split in 1872 as a result of scandals and rampant corruption in Grant&#x27;s first administration, which even reached Vice President Schuyler Colfax and had caused reformers to nominate Horace Greeley in futile opposition to Grant&#x27;s second term, successive Republican Presidents Grant, Rutherford B. Hayes and James A. Garfield appointed Foster the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico (1873–1880), then to Russia (1880–1881). President Chester A. Arthur made Foster the United States Ambassador to Spain (1883–1885).

In Benjamin Harrison&#x27;s administration, Foster served as a State Department &quot;trouble shooter&quot; before becoming Secretary of State for the final six months of Harrison&#x27;s term (from June 29, 1892, to February 23, 1893). As such, Foster replaced James Gillespie Blaine, who had succumbed to Bright&#x27;s disease, of which he later died. As Secretary of State, Foster &quot;helped direct the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy.&quot;

After leaving public office, Foster remained in Washington and invented a new type of legal practice, lobbying for large &quot;corporations seeking favors in Washington and chances to expand abroad.&quot; Foster also used his government and political contacts to secure legal fees as counsel to several foreign legations. He also continued to serve presidents part-time on diplomatic missions. As such, Foster negotiated trade agreements with eight countries, brokered a treaty with Britain and Russia concerning seal hunting in the Bering Sea, and negotiated one of the many unequal treaties between imperial powers and China, technically as legal consultant and commissioner for the Qing Dynasty, requiring China to cede land, pay reparations, open treaty ports, or grant extraterritorial privileges to foreign citizens.

Shortly before the Treaty of Shimonoseki ended the First Sino-Japanese War, Foster tried to convince Yuan Shikai to launch a military coup against the Qing dynasty.

In 1903, Foster published &quot;American diplomacy in the Orient&quot;, followed in 1904 by &quot;Arbitration and the Hague Court.&quot; In 1906, he wrote &quot;The practice of diplomacy as illustrated in the foreign relations of the United States&quot;. Foster wrote many other books.

==Family==
Foster married Mary Parke McFerson in 1859. Three of Foster&#x27;s children never reached adulthood. Foster sent his son to Princeton. Foster doted on his daughters&#x27; grandchildren, regaling them with tales of life on the frontier as well as in foreign lands (of which he retained many curios). His daughter Edith Foster married Presbyterian minister Allen Macy Dulles, and their children included John Foster Dulles (who also became a U.S. Secretary of State) and Allen Welsh Dulles, (Director of Central Intelligence). Foster&#x27;s daughter Eleanor married State Department legal advisor Robert Lansing (who later also served as U.S. Secretary of State); their niece Eleanor Lansing Dulles became an economist and diplomat. Foster was also the great-grandfather of the noted Catholic convert and theologian Cardinal Avery Dulles.

==Death and legacy==
Foster died in Washington, D.C., on November 15, 1917. His body was returned to Evansville, Indiana, where it remains in Oak Hill Cemetery, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places for Vanderburgh County.

<text>Paul George Vincent O&#x27;Shaughnessy Horgan (August 1, 1903 – March 8, 1995) was an American writer of historical fiction and non-fiction who mainly wrote about the Southwestern United States. He was the recipient of two Pulitzer Prizes for History.

Historian David McCullough wrote of Horgan in 1989: &quot;With the exception of Wallace Stegner, no living American has so distinguished himself in both fiction and history.&quot;

==Biography==
Paul Horgan was born in Buffalo, New York to a Catholic family on August 1, 1903. After his father contracted tuberculosis, the family moved in 1915 to Albuquerque, New Mexico for health reasons. Horgan attended New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico, where he formed a lifelong friendship with classmate and future artist Peter Hurd. Horgan befriended physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer in 1922 during a visit to New Mexico. After finishing high school, Horgan spent a year working for a local newspaper.

In 1923, Horgan enrolled in the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, but dropped out after the first year. He worked for the next three years in Rochester as the set designer for a new opera company being started by tenor Vladimir Rosing. Although Horgan had never designed sets before, he convinced Rosing to give him the job. The fledgling opera company later became the American Opera Company.

In 1924, Horgan returned to Albuquerque. He published his first novel, &quot;The Fault of Angels&quot;, about his experiences in Rochester in 1923; it won the Harper Prize. He continued to write 17 novels plus other works over the next five decades. Horgan served as president of the American Catholic Historical Association

During World War II, Horgan moved to Washington, D.C. to serve as the head of the Army Information Branch of the US War Department. He would eventually receive the Legion of Merit and be promoted to lieutenant colonel. He received a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1947. In 1955, Horgan won the Pulitzer Prize for History and the Bancroft Prize for history with &quot;Great River: The Rio Grande in North American History,&quot; a history of the Rio Grande River in Mexico and the United States.

In 1959, Horgan became a fellow at the Center for Advanced Studies (CAS) at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut. Over the next 35 years, he would serve as a director of CAS, an adjunct professor of English, and as a professor emeritus and permanent author-in-residence. The author Charles Barber served as a personal assistant to Horgan when Barber was a college student. During this period, Horgan also taught seminars and workshops at Yale University and the University of Iowa.

In 1976, Horgan won the Pulitzer Prize for History for &quot;Lamy of Santa Fe&quot; (Wesleyan University Press), a biography of Archbishop Jean-Baptiste Lamy.

Horgan published 40 books and received 19 honorary degrees from universities in the United States. He received a papal knighthood from Pope Pius XII. Paul Horgan died at Middlesex County Hospital in Middletown, Connecticut, on March 8, 1995.

==Literary works==
In 1970, Horgan started his &quot;Heroic Triad&quot; of novels, about the different cultures in the Southwest, with the publication of &quot;Whitewater.&quot; It was followed by &quot;Thin Mountain Air&quot; in 1977 and &quot;Mexico Bay&quot; in 1982.

One of Horgan&#x27;s most popular works was &quot;A Distant Trumpet&quot;, a historical novel based on the Apache wars in the Southwest. Horgan&#x27;s 1972 book &quot;Encounters With Stravinsky,&quot; a biography of composer Igor Stravinsky, was called &quot;an utterly irresistible book&quot; by &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer Simon Karlinsky. In 1960, author Robert Franklin Gish praised Horgan&#x27;s literary contributions in the monograph &quot;Paul Horgan: Yankee Plainsman&quot; &quot;and a few other works&quot;.

<text>is a Japanese novelist. Her novel &quot;Hebi ni piasu&quot; (&quot;Snakes and Earrings&quot;) won the Shōsetsu Subaru Literary Prize and the Akutagawa Prize, and sold over a million copies in Japan. Her work has been translated into more than a dozen languages worldwide.

==Early life==

Kanehara was born in Tokyo, Japan. During elementary school she spent a year in San Francisco with her father. At age 11, she dropped out of school, and at age 15 she left home. After leaving home, Kanehara pursued her passion for writing. Her father, Mizuhito Kanehara, a literary professor and translator of children&#x27;s literature, continued to support her.

==Career==

Kanehara wrote her first novel, &quot;Hebi ni piasu&quot; (&quot;Snakes and Earrings&quot;), at the age of 21. The novel won the Shōsetsu Subaru Literary Prize and the Akutagawa Prize (judged by novelist Ryū Murakami), and became a Japanese bestseller, going on to sell more than one million copies. Kanehara and fellow 2003 Akutagawa Prize honoree Risa Wataya remain the youngest people ever to receive the Akutagawa Prize. In the same year that she won the Akutagawa Prize, Kanehara got married.

Kanehara&#x27;s novel &quot;Autofiction&quot;, with a story that unfolds in reverse chronological order, was published in Japan in 2006. In 2007 an English version of &quot;Autofiction&quot;, translated by David James Karashima, was published by Vintage Books under the same name, and her novel &quot;Haidora&quot; (&quot;Hydra&quot;) appeared in print in Japan. A film adaptation of &quot;Hebi ni piasu&quot;, directed by Yukio Ninagawa and starring Yuriko Yoshitaka in the lead role, premiered in 2008. Kanehara&#x27;s novel &quot;Torippu torappu&quot; (&quot;TRIP TRAP&quot;) was published in 2009, and won the 2010 Sakunosuke Oda Prize.

When the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster occurred in 2011, Kanehara left Tokyo for Okayama out of concerns about the effects of radiation on her children. In 2012 she moved to France, and her book &quot;Mazāzu&quot; (&quot;Mothers&quot;) won the Bunkamura Deux Magots Literary Prize. While living in France with her husband and two daughters, Kanehara wrote several books, including &quot;Keihaku&quot; (&quot;Flirty&quot;) in 2016 and &quot;Kuraudo gāru&quot; (&quot;Cloud Girl&quot;) in 2017. After living in France for six years, in 2018 she and her family returned to Japan, where her essay collection &quot;Pari no Sabaku, Tōkyō no Shinkirō&quot; (&quot;Paris Desert, Tokyo Mirage&quot;), was published in 2020.

==Writing style==

Kanehara&#x27;s early work is known for its graphic depictions of sexual activity, violence, body modification, pedophilia, anorexia, bulimia, and self-harm. Kanehara has claimed that her own experiences with self-harm have inspired her fictional settings and characters, and reviews of &quot;Hebi ni piasu&quot; and &quot;Autofiction&quot; regularly focused on her own appearance and behavior. A common theme in her work is personal choice, with characters often making choices that place them outside societal norms in order to take control of their own actions and consequences. As Kanehara has explored this theme in her later work in the context of motherhood and family rather than youth and sex, media attention to her work has declined.

<text>Samuel Andrew Donaldson Jr. (born March 11, 1934) is a retired television reporter, and also news anchor. He broadcast with ABC News from 1967 to 2009. He was well known as the White House Correspondent (1977–1989 and 1998–99) with a booming loud voice, which could get the attention of President Reagan, amazingly cutting through the noise of whirling helicopter blades. He was a panelist and co-anchor of Sunday&#x27;s &quot;This Week&quot; on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).

==Early life and career==
Mr. Donaldson was born in El Paso, Texas. He is the son of Chloe (née Hampson), a school teacher, and Samuel Donaldson, a farmer. He grew up on their family farm in Chamberino, New Mexico. This was in the New Mexico Territory when his father had bought it in 1910, two years before New Mexico was admitted to the Union.

He attended New Mexico Military Institute and Texas Western College (now known as University of Texas at El Paso), where he served as station manager of KTEP, the campus radio station, and joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. From 1956 to 1959, Donaldson served on active duty as an artillery officer in the United States Army, attaining the rank of Captain (USAR). While on active duty in 1958, Donaldson was one of the military observers of an atomic test in the Nevada testing grounds when an atomic device, with a yield roughly equivalent to the bombs dropped on Japan, was detonated three thousand yards away from the slit trench protecting the observers.

Following military service, Donaldson was hired by KRLD-TV (now KDFW-TV), the then-CBS television affiliate in Dallas, Texas. After a year, he resigned and moved to New York City to look for a job in broadcast news. He failed to get one.

He was hired by WTOP-TV (currently WUSA-TV) in Washington, D.C., in February 1961. He covered both local and national stories, including the Goldwater presidential campaign in 1964, the Senate debates on the civil rights bill in March 1964, and the Medicare bill the following year. He anchored the 6:00 pm Saturday and Sunday evening newscasts, with John Douglas doing the weather forecasts.

==ABC News==
Donaldson was hired by ABC News as a Washington correspondent in October 1967. He covered the two major party political conventions in 1968 and in 1969 began anchoring the network&#x27;s 11:00 pm Saturday and Sunday newscasts.

In 1971, Donaldson covered the Vietnam War for ABC News. He was ABC&#x27;s chief Watergate correspondent in 1973–74, covering the trial of the Watergate burglars, the Senate Watergate hearings and the House Judiciary Committee&#x27;s impeachment investigation of President Nixon.

===Chief White House Correspondent===
Donaldson covered Jimmy Carter&#x27;s 1976 presidential campaign and became the network&#x27;s White House Correspondent in January 1977, a post he held until January 1989. One of his most widely remembered questions during his tenure at the White House came during the Reagan administration: &quot;Mr. President, in talking about the continuing recession tonight, you have blamed mistakes of the past, and you have blamed the congress. Does any of the blame belong to you?&quot; To which Reagan retorted: &quot;Yes, because for many years I was a Democrat!&quot; In January 1998, Donaldson was once again assigned to the White House as the network&#x27;s chief correspondent there and served until mid-1999. He covered the Lewinsky scandal and the impeachment of President Clinton.

===This Week===
Donaldson appeared as a panelist on the Sunday morning television program &quot;This Week with David Brinkley&quot; from its inception in 1981 and after Brinkley&#x27;s retirement in 1996 co-anchored the &quot;This Week&quot; program with Cokie Roberts until the two were replaced in September 2002 by George Stephanopoulos. He still occasionally serves as a panelist on &quot;This Week.&quot;

=== &quot;Primetime Live&quot; and &quot;20/20&quot; ===
In August 1989, Donaldson became co-anchor of the network&#x27;s new magazine program &quot;Primetime Live&quot; with Diane Sawyer. He and Sawyer co-anchored Primetime Live from 1989 to 1998 and its successor, &quot;20/20 Wednesday&quot;, from 1998 to 2000. One of his reports featured a Nazi Gestapo officer named Erich Priebke who had escaped to Argentina after World War II. Donaldson&#x27;s team located Priebke in 1994, and Donaldson interviewed him on a street in Bariloche, Argentina, about his role in the execution of 335 Italian civilians on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler in the caves outside Rome. When the report aired, Italy demanded Priebke&#x27;s extradition and Argentina eventually complied. Priebke was sentenced to life in prison in Italy for his crimes.

===Other===
Donaldson anchored the &quot;ABC Sunday Evening News&quot; from its inception in 1979 until August 1989.

In 1990–91, Donaldson covered the Gulf War (Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm) and co-anchored &quot;Primetime Live&quot; from Kuwait City two days after the Iraqi troops were forced out.

In 1991, he ended the ABC News &quot;Nightline&quot; broadcast to announce the dissolution of the Soviet Union with playing the Anthem of the Soviet Union and a video of the last Soviet Kremlin Flag lowered and the Raising of the Russian Tricolor, including the resignation of Gorbachev as President of the USSR.

In August 1992, Donaldson and his producer David Kaplan went to Sarajevo on assignment. On the way into town from the airport, Kaplan, riding in a second vehicle, was shot to death by a sniper. That night from Belgrade, Donaldson, co-anchoring the program &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, reported on Kaplan&#x27;s death.

In 2002, Donaldson anchored the first regularly scheduled U.S. news broadcast on the Internet and, in later years, hosted the ABC News Now &quot;Politics Live&quot; broadcast.

On August 2, 2006, during the last White House Press conference in the briefing room before undergoing major renovations, Donaldson shouted, &quot;Mr. President, should Mel Gibson be forgiven?&quot;, referencing reports of the actor/producer&#x27;s alleged anti-Semitic remarks. President George W. Bush laughed and looked up to see who had asked the question. Bush joked, &quot;Is that Sam Donaldson? Forget it ... you&#x27;re a &#x27;has-been&#x27;! We don&#x27;t have to answer has-beens&#x27; questions.&quot; Donaldson replied, &quot;Better to have been a has-been than a never-was.&quot;

With the exception of the Republican convention in August 1992, Donaldson covered every major political party convention from 1964 to 2012, until he retired from ABC in 2009.

Donaldson was voted Best White House Correspondent in 1985 by readers of the &quot;Washington Journalism Review&quot; and Best Television Correspondent in 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1989 by readers of the same magazine. Among his other awards are four Emmys, three Peabodys, the Edward R. Murrow award 1997 (WSU), the Paul White award (RTNDA 1998), and he and his wife Jan were among those named as &quot;Washingtonians of the Year&quot; by &quot;Washingtonian&quot; magazine in 2002.

===Federal aid scandals===
====Mohair subsidies====
In 1995, the struggle in DC over whether to cut the growing deficit touched Donaldson directly. Bruce Ingersoll, award-winning journalist for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal,&quot; published a column entitled &quot;As Congress Considers Slashing Crop Subsidies, Affluent Urban Farmers Come Under Scrutiny,&quot; where he named Donaldson as one of the wealthy, absentee beneficiaries of Federal subsidies, the &quot;third largest recipient&quot; of federal funds in his area.

During the debate in Congress over whether to cut &quot;pork,&quot; this article was read into the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, and Donaldson was chastised by Senator Al D&#x27;Amato to &quot;Give the money back,&quot; a phrase repeated multiple times in his floor speech and elsewhere.

There were claims that Donaldson received as much as $1 million in subsidies. The real number turned out to be around $188,000, but the scandal of a millionaire receiving money for a farm on which he was &quot;absentee&quot; still got significant public coverage.

The subsidy was held up as a sign of how meaningless much of the pork was, as the Federal government had stopped using mohair for uniforms in 1960, after only seven years of subsidies, but was still subsidizing its production over three decades later, and apparently giving out money to people other than &quot;poor family farmers.&quot; Even the Department of Agriculture was on record as wanting the program ended.

Donaldson initially refused to comment, but eventually defended himself by describing the mohair subsidy as &quot;built into the price of sheep,&quot; and claimed he had &quot;argued against subsidies for years&quot; and was glad when the program was finally &quot;killed,&quot; but in fact mohair subsidies continued all the way to 2012.

====Pest control====
Only a year later, Donaldson was embroiled in another Federal aid scandal. While still receiving Federal mohair subsidies, it was revealed that he was also using Federal resources to kill prairie dogs, bobcats, foxes, and coyotes on his ranch. His farm was reported to have used the USDA&#x27;s Animal Damage Control agents 412 times in only 5 years. This sparked outrage among both deficit hawks and animal rights activists.

This was actually brought to light by Donaldson&#x27;s own demands for more Federal money. He claimed to have lost a number of sheep to predators despite the heavy use of Federal resources, and therefore wanted Federal money to pay for his losses: &quot;The government helps ranchers and farmers and businesses of all kinds. If it&#x27;s in existence and I am eligible to use it, I&#x27;ll use it.&quot;

In an interview, Donaldson said of the animal rights complaints:

What are we going to do about the coyotes, that are eating the lambs like there&#x27;s no tomorrow? They&#x27;re eating so many lambs, I thought the other day I&#x27;d put out some mint jelly, in case they want it with their mutton. Every time I say this, the conservationists and the people who love animals just jump all over me. &quot;What? A coyote is a predator and has a right to live.&quot; Yeah, they have a right to live, I&#x27;m all for that, but they&#x27;re eating my lambs, folks. I just put it to you, doesn&#x27;t the lamb have a right to live? &quot;Yeah, but you&#x27;re going to sell the lamb and they&#x27;re going to kill the lamb for the money.&quot; That&#x27;s right. If you&#x27;re going to be in the sheep ranching business, you have to try to get rid of the coyotes. Otherwise, you&#x27;re not going to stay in the ranching business.

==Personal life==

Donaldson&#x27;s marriage to Jan Smith ended in divorce in 2014.

Donaldson has been married to Sandra Martorelli Donaldson since December 2014. They live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Donaldson has four children from previous marriages: Samuel III, Jennifer, Thomas, and Robert Donaldson.

In 1995, Donaldson had a melanoma removed from a lymph node. Since then, he has been an active supporter of cancer research.

Donaldson operates a family cattle ranch in Lincoln County, New Mexico. On July 5, 2004, three members of the ranch foreman&#x27;s family were found murdered. Cody Posey, a 14-year-old and sole remaining survivor of the family, was arrested and charged with the murders and subsequently convicted and sentenced to juvenile detention until age 21. On October 8, 2010, Posey was released.

Donaldson appears in the 2008 political documentary about Lee Atwater, entitled &quot;Boogie Man: The Lee Atwater Story&quot;. In the film, he says, &quot;An operative never comes and says, &#x27;here is a story I&#x27;d like you to run for me, but just in private conversation, did you know this about so and so, we&#x27;re still checking it mind you, but, but it&#x27;s probably going to turn out to be true.&#x27; Well, you don&#x27;t want to be beaten by your competition and wait until they announce it. They put it on the conveyor belt and you just run it out.&quot;

Donaldson is a past member of the board of directors of the Library of American Broadcasting, the American Academy of Achievement boards; the past president of the advisory board of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars; and chairman emeritus of the advisory board of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida. He is currently a member of the Board of New Mexico First, the State&#x27;s bi-partisan booster organization, and the Ford Theater Advisory Council.

On December 1, 2012, Donaldson was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol in Lewes, Delaware. Charges were dropped on Friday, November 8, 2013, by a Delaware judge, citing lack of probable cause for the arrest.

<text>Montacute House is a late Elizabethan mansion in Montacute, South Somerset, England. An example of English architecture created during a period that was moving from the medieval Gothic to the more classically-inspired Renaissance style, Montacute is one of the few prodigy houses to have survived almost unchanged from the Elizabethan era. The house has been designated as a Grade I listed building, and its gardens are also listed at the highest grade on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.

Designed by an unknown architect, possibly the mason William Arnold, the three-storey mansion, constructed of the local Ham Hill stone, was built in about 1598 for Sir Edward Phelips, a lawyer and politician who was Speaker of the House of Commons from 1604 until 1611, and subsequently Master of the Rolls from 1611 until his death in 1614. He was the prosecutor in the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters. Phelips&#x27; descendants occupied the house until the early 20th century. For a brief period, the house was let to tenants, one of whom was Lord Curzon, who lived at the house with his mistress, the novelist Elinor Glyn. The house narrowly escaped demolition in the early 20th century, when it was valued for scrap at just under £6,000. In 1931, Montacute was acquired by the National Trust. One of the earliest of the Trust&#x27;s acquisitions, the house came empty of its contents, and without the endowment the Trust subsequently required, its then secretary, James Lees-Milne describing it as an &quot;empty and rather embarrassing white elephant&quot;.

The east front of the house, the intended principal façade, is distinguished by its Dutch gables. The original approach would have been far more impressive than is seen today; the east façade faced onto a large entrance court and the two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse which was later demolished. This entrance court and gatehouse were approached through an even larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading which, with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, are in reality follies, an ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.

Montacute&#x27;s Long Gallery, the longest in England, serves as an outpost of the National Portrait Gallery displaying a range of historical portraits. The house and its gardens have been a filming location for several films and a setting for television costume dramas and literary adaptations. It was visited by over 183,000 people in 2019-2020.

== History ==

Montacute House was built in about 1598 by Sir Edward Phelips, whose family had lived in the Montacute area since at least 1460, first as yeomen farmers before rising in status. The site was bought from the Cluniac Montacute Priory by Thomas Phelips and passed to his grandson, also called Thomas, who started planning the house, but died before it was built and left the completion of the work to his son Edward. Edward Phelips was a lawyer who had been in Parliament since 1584. He was knighted in 1603 and a year later became Speaker of the House. James I appointed him Master of the Rolls and Chancellor to his son and heir Henry, Prince of Wales. Phelips remained at the hub of English political life, and his legal skills were employed when he became opening prosecutor during the trial of the Gunpowder Plotters.

Sir Edward&#x27;s choice of architect is unknown, although it has been attributed to the mason William Arnold, who was responsible for the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Dunster has architectural motifs similar to those found at Montacute. Phelips chose as the site for his new mansion a spot close by the existing house, built by his father. The date work commenced is undocumented, but is generally thought to be c. 1598/9, based on dates on a fireplace and in stained glass within the house. The date 1601, engraved above a doorcase, is considered to be the date of completion.

Sir Edward Phelips died in 1614, leaving his family wealthy and landed; he was succeeded by his son, Sir Robert Phelips, who represented various West Country constituencies in Parliament. Robert Phelips has the distinction of being arrested at Montacute. A staunch Protestant, he was subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London as a result of his opposition to the &quot;Spanish Match&quot; between the Prince of Wales and a Catholic Spanish Infanta.

The family&#x27;s fame and notoriety were to be short-lived. Subsequent generations settled down in Somerset to live the lives of county gentry, representing Somerset in Parliament and when necessary following occupations in the army and the church. This peaceful existence was jolted when the estate was inherited by William Phelips (1823–89), who in his early days made many improvements and renovations to Montacute. He was responsible for the Base Court, a low service range adjoining the south side of the mansion. and the restoration of the Great Chamber, which he transformed into a library. Later, he was to become insane; an addicted gambler, he was eventually incarcerated for his own good. Sadly for his family, this was after he had gambled away the family fortune and vast tracts of the Montacute Estate. In 1875, when his son William Phelips (1846–1919) took control of the estate, agricultural rents from what remained of the mortgaged estate were low, and the house was a drain on limited resources. Selling the family silver and artworks delayed the inevitable by a few years, but in 1911 the family were forced to let the house, for an annual sum of £650, and move out. The Phelipses never returned.

By 1915, the original tenant, Robert Davidson, had departed and the house was let to George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston. A later tenant was the American writer Henry Lane Eno, who died at the house in 1928.

The house was never to be a private residence again. It was offered for sale in 1929, and at a time when many country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With the exception of the Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.

Finally, in 1931, the house was sold to the philanthropist Ernest Cook, who presented it to the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and from that Society, it passed to the National Trust. It was one of the Trust&#x27;s first great houses. The following year, in 1932, it opened to the public for the first time. Bare of furnishing and without sufficient funds to maintain it, James Lees-Milne, the secretary of the Trust&#x27;s country house committee, described the mansion as an &quot;empty and rather embarrassing white elephant&quot;.

During the Second World War, Montacute was requisitioned by the army, and American soldiers were billeted in the surrounding parkland before the Normandy landings.

The house became a Grade I Listed Building on 19 April 1961, and the grounds were entered into the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England on 1 June 1984.

== Architecture ==
Built in what came to be considered the English Renaissance style, the east front, the intended principal façade, is distinguished by its Dutch gables decorated with clambering stone monkeys and other animals.
Architecture during the early English Renaissance was far less formal than that of mainland Europe and drew from a greater selection of motifs both ancient and modern, with less emphasis placed on the strict observance of rules derived from antique architecture. This has led to an argument that the style was an evolution of Gothic rather than an innovation imported from Europe. This argument is evident at Montacute, where Gothic pinnacles, albeit obelisk in form, are combined with Renaissance gables, pediments, classical statuary, ogee roofs and windows appearing as bands of glass. This profusion of large, mullioned windows, an innovation of their day, gives the appearance that the principal façade is built entirely of glass; a similar fenestration was employed at Hardwick Hall in Derbyshire. However, despite the Dutch gables, a feature of the English Renaissance acquired as the style spread from France across the Low Countries to England, and the Gothic elements, much of the architectural influence is Italian.
The windows of the second-floor Long Gallery are divided by niches containing statues, an Italian Renaissance feature exemplified at the Palazzo degli Uffizi in Florence (1560–81), which at Montacute depict the Nine Worthies dressed as Roman soldiers; the bay windows have shallow segmented pediments – a very early and primitive occurrence of this motif in England – while beneath the bay windows are curious circular hollows, probably intended for the reception of terracotta medallions, again emulating the palazzi of Florence. Such medallions were one of the Renaissance motifs introduced to English Gothic architecture when Henry VIII was rebuilding Hampton Court and supporting the claim that the English Renaissance was little more than Gothic architecture with Renaissance ornament. At Montacute, however, the Renaissance style is not confined to ornament, the house also has perfect symmetry. Paired stair towers stand in the angles between the main body of the house and the wings that project forward, a sign of modern symmetry in the plan of the house as well as its elevation, and a symptom of the times, in that the hall no longer had a &quot;high end&quot; of greater state.
Montacute, like many Elizabethan mansions, is built in an &#x27;E&#x27; shape, a much-used plan in this era. On the ground floor was the great hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, retiring rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and dining rooms evolved on the ground floor.

The original approach to the house would have been far more impressive than the picturesque approach today. The east front was then the entrance façade and faced onto a large entrance court. The two remaining pavilions flanked a large gatehouse; this long-demolished structure contained secondary lodgings. In turn, the entrance court and gatehouse were approached through a larger outer court. The courts were however not fortified, but bordered by ornate balustrading, which with the ogee roofs of the pavilions, which in reality were follies, were a purely ornamental and domestic acknowledgement of the fortified courts and approaches found in earlier medieval English manors and castles.

As in all houses of the Elizabethan era, Montacute had no corridors: the rooms led directly from one to another. This changed in 1787 when stonework from a nearby mansion at Clifton Maybank (which was being partly demolished) was purchased by Edward Phelips (1725–97) and used to rebuild Montacute&#x27;s west front. This provided a corridor giving privacy to the ground-floor rooms and first-floor bedrooms. Now, with the new frontage in place, the house was virtually turned around: the &quot;Clifton Maybank&quot; façade became the front entrance, and the impressive former front elevation now overlooked a lawn surrounded by flower borders, rather than the original entrance courtyard. The small pavilions with ogee domed roofs that flanked the demolished gatehouse remain. They may have been intended as banqueting houses, but by the 1630s were used as bedrooms.

== Interior ==

=== Ground floor ===
The addition of the Clifton Maybank corridor, built in the 18th century from stone obtained from another house then undergoing alteration, allowed the principal ground- and first-floor rooms to have some privacy from the servants&#x27; areas and linked the two staircases. It also allowed the house to be turned around by creating a new entrance façade facing west.

The Great Hall, leading off from the corridor, was the most important communal eating and living room, but by the time Montacute was completed the traditional Great Hall was largely an anachronism. Such halls continued to be built, however, albeit as at Montacute on a smaller scale. For the first few years after its completion, the servants continued to dine in the hall, but the family and honoured guests now ate in the Great Chamber above. The hall now served as a room to receive and also for processions to commence to the grander rooms above.

Leading off from the Great Hall are the family&#x27;s private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, possibly with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now the Drawing Room, originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in the Drawing Room in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.
The room on the opposite side of the Clifton Maybank corridor from the Great Hall was originally two rooms comprising the &quot;pannetry&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;) and &quot;buttery.&quot; In a large household the buttery and &quot;pannetry&quot; were part of the offices pertaining to the kitchen, and as at Montacute they were generally close to the Great Hall. The buttery was traditionally the place from which the yeoman of the buttery served beer and candles to those lower members of the household not entitled to drink wine. Montacute&#x27;s buttery is typical, as it had a staircase to the beer cellar below. The &quot;pannetry&quot; was the room from which the yeoman of the pantry served bread. By the time of Montacute&#x27;s completion, upper servants often dined and entertained visiting servants in the pantry. This layout was a medieval concept and later, as custom dictated that servants withdraw from the principal areas of the house, these rooms became used by the family as reception and private dining rooms. Eventually, in the early 20th century, Lord Curzon amalgamated the two rooms to create the grand, and socially necessary, dining room, which Montacute had lacked since the Great Chamber had been abandoned more than 100 years earlier.

The Servant&#x27;s Hall, from which a staircase in the bay window descends to the basement, became the servant&#x27;s dining room at the beginning of the 18th century. Outside, the six Doric columns on the East Terrace originally had decorative finials, now replaced by lamps.

=== First floor ===

The first floor contains one of the grandest rooms in the house, the Library. The room was formerly known as the Great Chamber; in a 16th-century mansion, such as Montacute, this room was the epicentre of all ceremony and state: hence, its position at the head of the principal staircase, making it the finale of a processional route. Here, the most important guests would have been received, and where the Phelips dined formally with their guests and where musical entertainment and dancing would take place. The Great Chamber at Montacute contains the finest chimney-piece in the house; however, its classical statuary depicting nudes is long gone, victims of Victorian prudery. During the 18th century the room was shut up and used as a store and permitted to decay; this explains why in the 19th century it was completely restored in &quot;Elizabethan style.&quot; The strapwork ceiling, panelling and bookcases all date from this period. The only original features remaining are the heraldic stained glass in the windows and the Portland stone chimney-piece. The room contains an ornate carved wooden porch; installed in the library in the 1830s, it was originally in the parlour below.

At the head of the principal staircase, an Anteroom divides the former Great Chamber from what would have been the main bedroom. During the 19th century, this room was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as a bedroom by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the few in the house.
Further rooms on this floor include the Crimson Chamber, which together with its small adjoining dressing room formed one room accessed from the Great Chamber. Described in 1638 the &quot;withdrawinge roome&quot;, it was used by the family to withdraw from the more public ceremonies held in the Great Chamber and also could be used to form a suite with the neighbouring bedroom, the Hall Chamber, when eminent guests were entertained in the house.

The Hall Chamber was another of the principal bedrooms; the adjoining Crimson Chamber originally served as the Hall Chamber&#x27;s &quot;withdrawinge roome.&quot; as the room was described in 1638. As a suite, the rooms were intended to be accessed by a now-blocked door in the Great Chamber. In this way, if an extremely high ranking guest was being entertained, they would then take over the entire suite including the Great Chamber. Although Montacute was equipped for a visiting sovereign, by the time it was completed Elizabeth I was dead and the family&#x27;s prominence was waning.

The floor has numerous other smaller rooms. As elsewhere in the house their usage frequently changed according to the requirements of the mansion&#x27;s occupants, and room names therefore often changed according to their use and decoration.

=== Second floor ===

A notable feature of the house is the second-floor Long Gallery, spanning the entire top floor of the house; it is the longest surviving long gallery in England. The gallery is lit by a continuous wall of glass on its eastern side while its length is extended by oriel windows at each end, which from the exterior appear to cling perilously to the wall, supported only by a small corbel to the masonry.

Long galleries were a feature of large 16th- and 17th-century houses and had many purposes, from entertaining to exercising during inclement weather; the Phelips children would lead their ponies up these stairs to ride in the gallery. Today, it is used by the National Portrait Gallery to display part of its collection.

Various former bedrooms lead from the Long Gallery, and like the gallery are now hung with paintings on loan from the National Portrait Gallery.

The attic floor above the second floor, which is not open to the public, contains some garret rooms that would always have been secondary bedchambers. It is likely that in the 16th and 17th centuries they would have been occupied by the senior servants; the lower servants would have slept in any vacant corner or space on the ground or basement floors.

== Montacute House Gardens ==

The gardens were well established by 1633, and by 1667 several walled gardens and courts had been added with established orchards. They were accompanied by stone gate lodges, which were removed in the 18th century.

The north-east and south-east corners of the former entrance forecourt have pavilions with ogee domed roofs, oriel windows and obelisks. The latter two are motifs of the house itself. The garden planting, laid out within the former forecourt and in the slightly sunken grassed parterre square, was the work of Mrs Ellen Phelips, who lived at Montacute from the 1840s to her death in 1911, and her gardener, Mr Pridham, who had worked for her at Coker Court. The avenue of clipped yews that reinforces the slightly gappy mature avenue of trees stretching away from the outer walls of the former forecourt to end in fields, and the clipped yews that outline the grassed parterre date from that time, though the famous &quot;melted&quot; shape of the giant hedge was inspired by the effects of a freak snowfall in 1947. The sunken parterre garden design, with its Jacobean-style central fountain, designed by Robert Shekelton Balfour (1869–1942), is of 1894; Balfour&#x27;s dated design is conserved in the library of the Royal Institute of British Architects. Mixed borders in the East court were replanted by Phyllis Reiss of Tintinhull in powerful hot colours when the earlier tender colour scheme laid down by Vita Sackville-West proved insipid to modern taste.

There are around of parkland and of more formally laid out gardens. These are the remains of the of parkland that previously surrounded the house.

===Listing designations===
The gardens and parkland surrounding Montacute are listed, Grade I, on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England. The house itself is also listed at this, the highest, grade, as are the two pavilions and the gateway flanking the East forecourt. The South lodge is listed at the next highest grade, II*. Other listed buildings on the estate, all designated Grade II, comprise: the New lodge and the Odcomb gate; the south-west and the north-west gates; the stables and the orangery adjacent to the house; and various architectural features in the gardens, including steps to the sunken garden, the pool and fountain in the North garden, a summer house restored by Lord Curzon, the North and East terraces, and two walled enclosures.

== Present day ==

During the last quarter of the 20th century the gardens and grounds were restored and replanted. 
In 1975, London&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery formed the first of its regional partnerships, a partnership that marries empty large antique spaces with the many paintings the gallery has insufficient space to display. This has seen Montacute&#x27;s Long Gallery redecorated and restored and hung with an important collection of historical portraits from the reign of Henry VIII to that of Charles I.

The house and grounds are open to the public. In 2019-2020, the National Trust recorded over 183,000 visitors.

== In popular culture ==
The house and village have often featured as locations for films. Several scenes of the 1995 film version of Jane Austen&#x27;s novel &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; were filmed at Montacute, as were scenes from the 2004 film &quot;The Libertine&quot;. The house was used as Baskerville Hall for a version of &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; filmed in 2000 for Canadian television. In May–June 2014 the house was used as one of the locations for the BBC&#x27;s adaption of Hilary Mantel&#x27;s novel, Wolf Hall. The &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; short film for 2012 is set at a house that seems to be based on Montacute House. The short was created in celebration of the National Trust and is titled &quot;A Jubilee Bunt-A-Thon&quot;. The fictional location for the earlier &quot;Wallace and Gromit&quot; film &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;, Tottington Hall, was also based on Montacute House.

<text>A zamindar in the Indian subcontinent was an autonomous or semi-autonomous feudal lord of a &quot;zamindari&quot; (feudal estate). The term itself came into use during the Mughal Empire, when Persian was the official language; &quot;zamindar&quot; is the Persian for &quot;landowner&quot;. During the British Raj, the British began using it as a local synonym for &quot;estate&quot;. Zamindars as a class were equivalent to lords and barons; in some cases, they were independent sovereign princes. Similarly, their holdings were typically hereditary and came with the right to collect taxes on behalf of imperial courts or for military purposes.

During the Mughal Empire, as well as the British rule, zamindars were the land-owning nobility of the Indian subcontinent and formed the ruling class. Emperor Akbar granted them mansabs and their ancestral domains were treated as jagirs. Most of the big zamindars belonged to the Hindu high-caste, usually Brahmin, Bhumihar, Kayastha and Rajput. During the colonial era, the Permanent Settlement consolidated what became known as the &quot;zamindari system&quot;. The British rewarded supportive zamindars by recognising them as princes. Many of the region&#x27;s princely states were pre-colonial zamindar holdings elevated to a greater protocol. The British also reduced the land holdings of many pre-colonial princely states and chieftaincies, demoting their status to noble zamindars from previously higher ranks of royalty. During the period of British colonial rule in India, many wealthy and influential zamindars were bestowed with noble and royal titles such as &quot;Maharaja&quot;, &quot;Raja/Rai, Babu&quot;, Malik, Chaudhary, &quot;Nawab&quot;, Khan and Sardar.

The system was abolished during land reforms in East Pakistan (Bangladesh) in 1950, India in 1951 and West Pakistan in 1959.
The zamindars often played an important role in the regional histories of the subcontinent. One of the most notable examples is the 16th-century confederation formed by twelve zamindars in the Bhati region (Baro-Bhuyans), which, according to the Jesuits and Ralph Fitch, earned a reputation for successively repelling Mughal invasions through naval battles. The zamindars were also patrons of the arts. The Tagore family produced India&#x27;s first Nobel laureate in literature in 1913, Rabindranath Tagore, who was often based at his estate. The zamindars also promoted neoclassical and Indo-Saracenic architecture.

==Mughal era==
When Babur conquered North India, there were many autonomous and semiautonomous rulers who were known locally as Rai, Raja, Rana, Rao, Rawat, etc., while in the various Persian chronicles, they were referred to as zamindars and . They were vassals who ruled, mostly hereditarily, over their respective territories. They commanded not only a considerable part of the economic resources of the empire but also military power. After the conquest of Hindustan, Babur informs us that one-sixth of its total revenues came from the territories of the chiefs. He writes: &quot;The revenue of the countries now held by me (1528 A.D.) from Bhira to Bihar, is fifty-two crores as will be known in detail. Eight or nine crores of this are from the parganas of rais and the rajas who have submitted in the past (to the Sultans of Delhi), receive allowance and maintenance.&quot;

According to Arif Qandhari, one of the contemporary historians of Akbar&#x27;s reign, there were around two to three hundred rajas or rais and zamindars who ruled their territory from strong forts under the emperor&#x27;s suzerainty. Each of these rajas and zamindars commanded an army of their own, generally consisting of their clansmen and the total numbers of their troops, as Abul Fazl tells us, stood at forty-four lakhs, comprising 384,558 cavalry, 4,277,057 infantry, 1863 elephants, 4260 guns and 4500 boats.
During the Mughal Era, there was no clear difference between the princely states and zamindari estates. Even the ruling autonomous chiefs of princely states were called zamindars.
Moreland was one of the first historians to draw our attention to the importance of zamindars in medieval India. He defines zamindars as &quot;vassal chiefs&quot;. He points out that there were areas under direct control of the Mughals where there were no zamindars and then there were territories of the vassal chiefs who had autonomy over their state, but were subjugated by the Mughals and paid a tribute/ nazarana to the Mughal Emperor. However, Irfan Habib in his book &quot;Agrarian System of Mughal India&quot;, divided the zamindars into two categories: the autonomous chiefs who enjoyed &quot;sovereign power&quot; in their territories and the ordinary zamindars who exercised superior rights in land and collected land revenue and were mostly appointed by the Mughals. These people were known as the zamindars (intermediaries), and they collected revenue primarily from the Ryots (peasants). The zamindari system was more prevalent in the north of India because Mughal influence in the south was less apparent.
Historian S. Nurul Hasan divided the zamindars into three categories: (i) The Autonomous Rai/ Rajas or Chiefs, (ii) the intermediary zamindars and (iii) the primary zamindars.

==British era==
The East India Company established themselves in India by first becoming zamindars of three villages of Calcutta, Sultani and Govindpur. Later, they acquired the 24-Parganas and, in 1765, got control of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Later in 1857, the British Crown was established as the sovereign.

During the Mughal Era, the zamindars were not proprietors. They used to engage in wars and used to plunder neighbouring kings. So they never looked after the improvements in their land. The East India Company under Lord Cornwallis, realising this, made the Permanent Settlement in 1793 with the zamindars and made them proprietors of their land in return for a fixed annual rent and left them independent for the internal affairs of their estates. This Permanent Settlement created the new zamindari system as we know it today. After 1857, the armies of the majority of zamindars were abolished with the exception of a small number of forces for policing/digwari/kotwali in their respective estates. If the zamindars were not able to pay the rent until sunset, parts of their estates were acquired and auctioned. This created a new class of zamindars in the society. As the rest of India came later under the control of the East India Company (EIC), different ways were implemented in different provinces to with regard to the ruling authorities in the region to get them to accede to Company authority. 

The British generally adopted the extant zamindari system of revenue collection in the north of the country. They recognised the zamindars as landowners and proprietors as opposed to the Mughal government and, in return, required them to collect taxes. Although some zamindars were present in the south, they were not so in large numbers, and the British administrators used the ryotwari (cultivator) method of collection, which involved selecting certain farmers as being land owners and requiring them to remit their taxes directly.

The Zamindars of Bengal were influential in the development of Bengal. They played a pivotal role during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

The British continued the tradition of bestowing both royal and noble titles to zamindars who were loyal to the paramount. The titles of Raja, Maharaja, Rai Saheb, Rai Bahadur, Rao, Nawab, and Khan Bahadur were bestowed to princely state rulers and to many zamindars from time to time. According to an estimate in the Imperial Gazetteer of India, there were around 2000 ruling chiefs holding the royal title of Raja and Maharaja which included the rulers of princely states and several large chiefdoms. This number increases tenfold if zamindar/ jagirdar chiefs with other non-royal but noble titles are taken into account.

===Accession===
Unlike the autonomous or frontier chiefs, the hereditary status of the zamindar class was circumscribed by the Mughals, and the heir depended to a certain extent on the pleasure of the sovereign. Heirs were set by descent or, at times, even adoption by religious laws. Under the British Empire, the zamindars were to be subordinate to the Crown and not act as hereditary lords, but at times family politics was at the heart of naming an heir. At times, a cousin could be named an heir with closer family relatives present; a lawfully wedded wife could inherit the zamindari if the ruling zamindar named her an heir.

==Abolition==
The zamindari system was mostly abolished in independent India soon after its creation with the First Amendment of the Constitution of India, which amended the right to property as shown in Articles 19 and 31. In East Pakistan, the East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950 had a similar effect of ending the system.

==In global health and tropical medicine==
Critics have likened the discipline of global health and tropical medicine to having a feudal structure where individuals and institutions in high-income nations act as zamindars over health issues of low-and-middle-income nations, thus sustaining the imperial nature of global health.
