<text>Hay is a town in the western Riverina region of south-western New South Wales, Australia. It is the administrative centre of Hay Shire local government area and the centre of a prosperous and productive agricultural district on the wide Hay Plains.

Located approximately midway between Sydney and Adelaide at the junction of the Sturt, Cobb and Mid-Western Highways, Hay is an important regional and national transport node. The town itself is built beside the Murrumbidgee River, part of the Murray–Darling river system; Australia&#x27;s largest. The main business district of Hay is situated on the north bank of the river.

== History ==
Aboriginal communities in the western Riverina were traditionally concentrated in the more habitable river corridors and amongst the reedbeds of the region.  The district surrounding Hay was occupied by at least three separate Aboriginal groups at the time of European settler expansion onto their lands.  The area around the present township appears to have been a site of interaction between the Nari-Nari people of the Lower Murrumbidgee and the Wiradjuri who inhabited a vast region in the central-western inland of New South Wales.

In late 1829 Charles Sturt and his men passed along the Murrumbidgee River on horses and drays. They launched their whale-boat near the Murrumbidgee-Lachlan junction and continued the journey by boat to the Murray River and eventually to the sea at Lake Alexandrina (before returning by the same route). During the late-1830s stock was regularly overlanded to South Australia via the Lower Murrumbidgee.  At the same time stockholders were edging westward along and the Lachlan, Murrumbidgee, Billabong and Murray systems.  By 1839 all of the river frontages in the vicinity of present-day Hay were occupied by squatters. By the mid-1850s pastoral runs in the western Riverina were well-established and prosperous. The nearby Victorian gold-rushes provided an expanding market for stock. The prime fattening country of the Riverina became a sort of holding centre, from where the Victorian market could be supplied as required. One of the popular routes established in the mid-1850s crossed the Murrumbidgee River at Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place.

===Lang’s Crossing place===

The locality where Hay township developed was originally known by Europeans as Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place (named after three brothers named Lang who were leaseholders of runs on the southern side of the river).  It was the crossing on the Murrumbidgee River of a well-travelled stock-route (known as &quot;the Great North Road&quot;) leading to the markets of Victoria.  In 1856-7 Captain Francis Cadell, pioneer of steam-navigation on the Murray River, placed a manager at Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place with the task of establishing a store (initially in a tent).  In December 1857 Thomas Simpson re-located from Deniliquin to establish a blacksmith shop and residence at Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place.  Six months later the Canadian shipwright Henry Leonard arrived; he commenced building a hotel and dwelling-house near Simpson&#x27;s buildings and launched a punt on the river.  In August 1858 steamers owned by rival owners, Francis Cadell and William Randell, successfully travelled up the Murrumbidgee as far as Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place (with Cadell&#x27;s steamer &quot;Albury&quot; continuing up-river to Gundagai).

Henry Jeffries, the leaseholder of &quot;Illilawa&quot; station (which included Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place at its western extremity), was vehemently opposed to Henry Leonard&#x27;s operations; threats against his punt caused Leonard to stand guard with a loaded gun. An attempt by Jeffries to pull down Leonard&#x27;s hotel as it was being constructed caused an outcry from those advocating a settlement at the location. In consequence the NSW Government sent a surveyor to map out a new township. Henry Leonard completed his inn and opened it on 30 October 1858. The Murrumbidgee Punt Hotel was described as a &quot;large size&quot; weatherboard building with a shingled roof &quot;and a fine verandah along the front&quot;. By mid-1859 the Department of Lands had proclaimed reservations on either side of the river at Lang&#x27;s Crossing-place and Henry Shiell was appointed Police Magistrate. By October 1859 the township had been named &quot;Hay&quot; after John Hay (later Sir John), a wealthy squatter from the Upper Murray, member of the NSW Legislative Assembly and former Secretary of Lands and Works. Later the same month successful land-sales were held at Hay.

===The township&#x27;s first decades: 1859 to 1880===

&#x27;Lang’s Crossing Place&#x27; Post Office opened on 16 April 1859 and was renamed &quot;Hay&quot; to match the township name in 1861. In early 1860 a brick court-house and lock-up was built at Hay (at the site of the present post office).

The census taken in April 1861 revealed that there were 172 people living at Hay township, consisting of 115 males (of whom 25 were aged 15 years or under) and 57 females (of whom 23 were aged 15 years or under). Of the 90 males aged 16 years or more, only 38% were married or widowed; of the 34 females in this category, 76% were married or widowed. The census also enumerated the buildings at the new township: 4 brick structures; 17 of &quot;weatherboard, slab or inferior&quot;; and, 14 tents.

In April 1861 two new hotel licences were granted at Hay: the Caledonian Hotel (Thomas E. Blewett and George Dorward) and the Argyle Hotel (Thomas Simpson).  The two hotels were located side by side in Lachlan Street.  During 1862 the Argyle closed its doors, and was offered for sale.  In September 1865 George Maiden briefly re-opened it as the Royal Mail Hotel.  In February 1866, Christopher Ledwidge, landlord of the Caledonian Hotel since 1864, purchased the Royal Mail and incorporated the two into one hotel. The Caledonian Hotel was badly damaged by fire in 2006 and demolished the following year.

According to the 1871 census of the Colony of New South Wales there were 664 people living at Hay township: 388 males and 276 females.  The proportion of those in the Hay community aged less than 16 years had increased from 28% in 1861 to 38% in 1871.

In November 1871 a petition was prepared by the residents of Hay requesting that the township be granted municipal status.  Elections for aldermen were held in August 1872.  At the first municipal meeting the local businessman, Frank Johns, was elected mayor.

The first bridge over the Murrumbidgee River at Hay was built in 1872 at a cost of £20,000. The structure included a turntable which enabled the middle-section to be swung open to allow the passage of steamers.  The opening of the Hay Bridge was delayed while the approaches were formed. It was finally opened on 31 August 1874 by the Colonial Secretary of New South Wales, Henry Parkes.  The old bridge was eventually replaced by a new one, opened in June 1973. The old Hay Bridge was subsequently demolished. The turntable, last used in 1946, was placed in the river-bend just north of where the bridge had been.

As it developed Hay became an essential hub of the surrounding district. Pastoral runs surrounding the township were the main employers of labour; with its stores and hotels, hospital, post-office, banks, court-house and police-station, Hay became an important focus for rural workers and resident squatters alike. Carriers, contractors, wool-buyers and dealers in stock established themselves at Hay and the township became a busy port for the steamers plying the inland rivers. Stores for the township and district stations were unloaded at the wharves at Hay, and the steamers and barges loaded with wool-bales for the return trip (usually to Echuca, which by 1864 had been connected by rail to Melbourne).

The writer Joseph Furphy lived at Hay in the 1870s while working as a carrier in charge of a team of bullocks.  Furphy later used the area surrounding Hay as the setting for his novel &quot;Such is Life&quot; (published in 1903).

During 1879–80 the local building firm, Witcombe Brothers, constructed a new gaol at Hay, to replace the old Lock-up in Lachlan Street (at the site of the current Post Office).  The new Hay Gaol was opened in December 1880.

===Consolidation: 1881 to 1914===

During 1881–82 the railway line was extended from Narrandera to Hay and a new railway station constructed at Hay. The new line, connecting Hay directly to Sydney, was opened in July 1882. The extension of the NSW railway to Hay signalled a decline in the importance of the transportation of wool by river-steamer and a shift in the local economic focus from Melbourne to Sydney. The railway to Sydney operated with a differential price structure, ensuring that rail became a desirable mode of transporting wool for many of the Riverina stations.

In 1883 the extensive Anglican diocese of Goulburn was divided, with the western half designated as the major portion of the newly created Diocese of Riverina. Hay was chosen as the episcopal seat of the new diocese and Bishop Sydney Linton was consecrated on 1 May 1884 at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London. Linton and his family travelled to Sydney and then on to Hay, where the bishop was enthroned on 18 March 1885 in the old St Paul&#x27;s church.  The new St. Paul&#x27;s – pro-cathedral of the new diocese – was completed by the end of 1885. In 1889 a residence was completed for Bishop Linton at South Hay; the design and materials used in constructing the corrugated-iron clad ‘Bishop’s Lodge’ was an attempt to cope with Hay&#x27;s climatic extremes.  Hay remained the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Riverina until 1953 when it was transferred to Narrandera, New South Wales.

===The Great War and afterwards===
During the First World War 641 men enlisted for service from Hay and the surrounding district, one of the highest per capita enlistment rates in Australia.  Of the men who enlisted one-in-six died during the war, with devastating effect on the close-knit communities of the Hay district.

In 1919 a proposal was adopted to build a High School at Hay as a memorial to those who died in the Great War.  The Hay War Memorial High School was opened on Anzac Day, 1923, with Mr. L. E. Penman as the first headmaster.

===Internees and POWs===
During World War II Hay was the location of internment and prisoner of war camps, due in no small measure to its isolated location. Three high-security camps were constructed there in 1940. The first arrivals were over two thousand refugees from Nazi Germany and Austria, many of them Jewish, aged between 16 and 60. They had been rounded up in Britain when fears of invasion were at their peak, and were then transported to Australia aboard the HMT &quot;Dunera&quot;. They arrived at Hay on 7 September 1940 in four trains from Sydney and were interned in Camps 7 and 8 (located near the Hay showground) under the guard of the 16th Garrison Battalion of the Australian Army.

Later known as the &#x27;Dunera Boys&#x27;, the internment at Hay of this assemblage of refugees from Nazi oppression in Europe was an important milestone in Australia&#x27;s cultural history. 800 of those interned at Hay eventually chose to remain in Australia. The influence of this group of men on subsequent cultural, scientific and business developments in Australia is difficult to over-state; many became an integral and celebrated part of the nation&#x27;s cultural and intellectual life. The &#x27;Dunera Boys&#x27; are still fondly remembered in Hay. Every year the town holds a &#x27;Dunera Day&#x27; in which many surviving internees return to the site of their former imprisonment.

In November 1940 the other compound at Hay, Camp 6 (near the Hay Hospital), was occupied by Italian civilian internees. Camps 7 and 8 were vacated in May 1941 when the &quot;Dunera&quot; internees left Hay; some were sent to Orange (NSW), others to Tatura in Victoria, and others to join the Pioneer Corps of the Australian Army. Upon their departure Italian prisoners-of-war were placed in Camps 7 and 8. In December 1941 Japanese internees (some from Broome and islands north of Australia) were conveyed to Hay and placed in Camp 6. In April 1942 the River Farm began operating on the eastern edge of the town, enabling market-gardening and other farm activities to be carried out by the Italian internees and POWs. In August 1944, in the wake of the Cowra POW break-out on 5 August 1944, 600 Japanese POWs were transferred to Hay and placed in the two high-security compounds 7 and 8. On 1 March 1946 the last of the Japanese POWs left Hay. During 1946 the Italians who remained there were progressively released or transferred to other camps, and the Hay camps were dismantled, and building materials and fittings sold off, by June the following year.

== Heritage listings ==
Hay has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 355 Church Street: Hay Gaol
* 120 Lachlan Street: Hay Post Office
* Moama Street: Bishops Lodge
* Narrandera–Hay railway: Hay railway station

== Geography &amp; Climate ==

The Riverine Plain is an alluvial plain consisting of sediments of silt, clay and fine sand deposited by the extensive ancestral streams of the early Quaternary period (overlying more ancient granite rocks and sediments).  The snow-fed Murrumbidgee River flows westwards across this plain; to the north its major tributary, the Lachlan, flows in a long arc until the two rivers join in a maze of reed-bed swamps and channels between Hay and Balranald.  South of the Murrumbidgee the Billabong Creek is fed by a variety of streams, and eventually flows into the Edward River (an anabranch of the Murray River).  Plant communities along the river corridors near Hay typically consist of forests dominated by River Red Gum (&quot;Eucalyptus camaldulensis&quot;), with Black Box trees (&quot;E. largiflorens&quot;) on the outer margins and in low-lying areas further from the river.

Away from the river Hay is surrounded by flat, mostly-treeless plains, predominately of grey clay and red earth soils.  Saltbush shrublands (&quot;Atriplex&quot; sp.), with an understorey of grasses and forbs, was the dominant plant community at the time of European settlement.  However severe depletion of the saltbush has occurred after years of overstocking, damage by rabbits and the broad-scale agriculture of recent decades, particularly in areas along the river and proximate to irrigation canals.  The plains surrounding Hay feature a complex system of shallow creek beds and dry lakes, interspersed by wind-created sand-ridges where Cypress-pine (&quot;Callitris&quot; sp.) is often found growing.

===Climate===
Hay has a cold semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with hot, dry summers featuring clear skies and cool, partly cloudy winters. Rainfall and mean temperature records have been kept for Hay since 1877; however, extreme temperature records only from 1957 onwards. Temperature extremes are quite marked over the full year: summers are regularly over while winters can see daytime temperatures below . The highest temperature recorded at Hay was on 5 January 2013; the lowest recorded was on 3 August 2014. The average annual rainfall is . On the whole it is considerably sunny with 143.6 clear days annually.

On 24 July 1936 a flurry of snow was reported to have occurred in Hay, which if verified would be the lowest known snowfall to have ever been observed in the state of New South Wales, at just above sea level, though it did not settle on the ground. 

==Demographics==
At the 2021 census, Hay township had a population of 2,882, of whom 8.3% were of indigenous origin. 80.0% of the residents of Hay are Australian-born (compared to 66.9% nationwide), 84.0% of people spoke only English at home and 41.4% of the population are 55 years of age or older (compared to 29.1% in Australia as a whole).

The most common responses for religion were Catholic 27.6%, No Religion 24.3%, Anglican 21.7% and Not stated 12.3%.

==Transportation==
Hay&#x27;s railway station is the terminus of the Hay branch off the Main South Line via Yanco. However, this station is currently closed. The last passenger train ran in 1983 after 101 years of service. The goods service was closed in November 1984. The heritage listed Hay Railway Station c1882 was restored in 2005 at a cost of $1m. It features on an Australian stamp. The Dunera Museum at Hay Railway Station is housed in air conditioned carriages and has been visited by over 31,000 persons between 2002 and 2014. The Hay Internment and POW Camps Interpretive Centre housed there tells the stories of over 6,600 German, Italian, Japanese and Australian civilian Internees and Italian and Japanese POW&#x27;s imprisoned there between 1940 and 1946 in three camps 6,7,8 of 1,000 men each.

Hay is accessible by the Cobb Highway, the Mid Western Highway and the Sturt Highway. Coach services are offered to Cootamundra from which train services are offered to Sydney or Melbourne, and also to Mildura. The Hay Bridge carries the Cobb Highway across the Murrumbidgee River in the town of Hay.

==Agriculture==
Hay is one of Australia&#x27;s leading wool growing and sheep meat producing areas, with the area home to around 26 parent studs. Cattle are also produced for sale for slaughter and, in recent years, for sale to feedlots for fattening. In irrigated areas, crops such as lettuce, pumpkins, tomatoes, garlic, corn, rockmelons, watermelons and broccoli are grown, picked and packaged in the area. Hay is also the leading producer in the Riverina of safflower, lettuce and broccoli.

In recent years, rice and cotton have been produced in Hay, so much so that the Hay Plain has colloquially become known as the Hay Paddy. While colder growing seasons have hindered the development of the cotton industry, rice production has expanded from over 400 hectares in 1991-92 to over 7,000 hectares in 1997–98, with production for the Hay district in 2002 estimated at 75,375 tonnes. A rice receival depot on the outskirts of town is capable of drying up to 32,000 tonnes of rice before delivery to the mill at Deniliquin.

==Sport==
Hay, like many places in the Riverina, supports and competes in a wide variety of sport, including all major football codes.

The Hay Magpies are a Rugby league team playing in Group 20, a competition consisting of teams from towns situated in the South Western Riverina area. In the history of Group 17, the Hay Magpies won 12 premierships, more than any other team in the group. The Magpies moved into Group 20 in 2007, after the collapse of Group 17, with Hay being the only town from the former competition to survive. The competition has since returned, however Hay decided to remain in Group 20.
The local Rugby Union team is the Hay Cutters playing in the Southern Inland Rugby Union against teams from as far away as Tumut and Albury.

The Hay Lions are an Australian Rules Football club and were inaugurated on Friday, 19 May 1876. They are currently competing in the Golden Rivers Football League which consists of small towns in northern Victoria and the western Riverina.

The Hay Jockey Club runs a popular annual race meeting in November, promoted as &quot;the biggest day in the year&quot;. Whilst the meeting is professional and supported by the TAB, it retains a &quot;picnic races&quot; atmosphere.

==Media==
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) provides a range of television and radio stations to the Hay district including ABC TV, digital television channels, ABC1, ABC2, ABC3, ABC News 24, national radio stations, ABC Riverina, ABC Radio National.
Regional broadcasters, Prime7, WIN Television and Network 10 are the commercial television stations available in Hay. Network 10 is available from the digital signals only.

The &quot;Riverine Grazier&quot; is the local weekly newspaper, first published in 1873. The newspaper has a circulation of 5,000 and services the areas of Hay, Booligal and Ivanhoe. The &quot;Riverine Grazier&quot; is published on Wednesdays.
Other daily papers from Griffith, Sydney and Melbourne are available in Hay.

2HayFM is the community radio station of Hay, broadcasting to inhabitants of the town and surrounding areas. It plays a mix of music, news and information on local matters using paid staff and volunteers. 2HayFM broadcasts on 92.1 FM with a range about 100 km around Hay.

<text>Golden Highway (also known as Mitchells Line of Road at its eastern end) is a highway, located in the Hunter and Orana regions of New South Wales, Australia. It runs eastwards from Dubbo towards Newcastle on the coast, allowing road transport to avoid travelling over the Blue Mountains to Sydney, and is designated route B84.

==Route==

Golden Highway commences at the intersection with Newell Highway in Dubbo and heads in an easterly direction as a four-lane, single-carriageway road, narrowing to two lanes through Dubbo&#x27;s eastern suburbs, and continues through Dunedoo where it is concurrent with Castlereagh Highway for approximately then through Merriwa, Sandy Hollow, Denman, Jerrys Plains and Mount Thorley, where it eventually terminates at the intersection with New England Highway at Belford, south of Singleton. Bylong Valley Way turns off Golden Highway east of Sandy Hollow. Golden Highway and Putty Road are concurrent for around , east of the Mount Thorley industrial estate near Singleton. The highway then turns east onto Mitchells Line of Road while Putty Road continues to Singleton.

Golden Highway provides a fairly low altitude crossing of the Great Dividing Range. It runs through the Hunter Region and gives access to the golden west of New South Wales.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Main Road No. 62 was declared from the intersection with Great Northern Highway (today New England Highway) at Scone, via Merriwa and Cassilis to the intersection with Craboon-Mullaley Road at Coolah, Main Road No. 206 was declared from the intersection of North-Western Highway (today Mitchell Highway) in Dubbo, via Ballimore to Dunedoo, Main Road No. 209 was declared from Muswellbrook, via Denman to Merriwa, and Main Road No. 213 was declared from Mount Thorley, via Jerrys Plains to Denman, on the same day, 8 August 1928. With the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 62 and Main Roads 206 and 209 and 213 on 8 April 1929.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the New South Wales MRB in 1932, re-routed the western end of Trunk Road 62 from Coolah to terminate at the intersection of Trunk Road 55 (later Castlereagh Highway) in Craboon (8km east of Dunedoo) on 29 June 1977; the former alignment between Cassilis and Coolah was re-declared as Main Road 618.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Golden Highway was declared as State Highway 27 on 22 November 1996, from the intersection with New England Highway at Minimbah east of Whittingham via Mount Thorley, Jerrys Plains, Denman, Merriwa, Cassilis and Dunedoo to the intersection with Newell Highway in Dubbo, subsuming Main Roads 206 and 213; The highway today, as Highway 27, still retains this declaration.

State Route 84 was signed across Main Road 206, Trunk Road 62, and Main Road 213 - from Dubbo via Dunedoo, Cassilis, Merriwa and Denman to Muswellbrook - in 1974; when Golden Highway was declared in 1996, the eastern end of State Route 84 was altered to follow it and terminate at Belford. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B84.

===Prime minister===
====First term (1998–1999)====
From September 1998 to October 1999 Majko held his first government as prime minister of Albania. He was the youngest Prime Minister of Albania, appointed when he was 30 years old in 1998 for the first time.

====Second term (2002)====

==Personal life==
Majko was born in Tirana, to a family originally from Gjirokastra. In March 2013, after voting in favor of changing the name of the Liqenas to &quot;Pustec&quot; through a Facebook status, he denied having Slavic roots and introduced the beginning of his family, which started with a German doctor who moved from Parga to Gjirokastra due to the occupation of Parga by Ali Pasha of Ioannina, where he later married a local woman and was nicknamed &quot;Memeci&quot; due to the lack of fluent communication in the Albanian language, a nickname that would later become a surname. But later, this surname was changed to Majko by Pandeli&#x27;s great-grandfather due to the trade relations that the family had at that time.

In April 2016, at his request, Pandeli Maiko was granted Kosovar citizenship through the mediation of former Kosovo President  Atifete Jahjaga.

<doc id="613818" wikidata="Q323133" url="?curid=613818" title="Arthashastra">
<text>Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra (, ; ) is an Ancient Indian Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, politics, economic policy and military strategy. The text is likely the work of several authors over centuries, starting as a compilation of &quot;Arthashastras&quot;, texts which according to Olivelle date from the 2nd c. BCE to the 1st c. CE. These treatises were compiled and amended in a new treatise, according to McClish and Olivelle in the 1st century CE by either an anonymous author or Kautilya, though earlier and later dates have also been proposed. While often regarded as created by a single author, McClish and Olivelle argue that this compilation, possibly titled &quot;Daņdanīti&quot;, served as the basis for a major expansion and redaction in the 2nd or 3rd century CE by either Kautilya or an anonymous author, when several books, dialogical comments, and the disharmonious chapter-division were added, and a stronger Brahmanical ideology was brought in. The text thus became a proper &quot;arthashastra&quot;, and was retitled to &quot;Kautilya&#x27;s Arthashastra&quot;.

Two names for the text&#x27;s compilor or redactor are used in the text, Kauṭalya (Kautilya) and Vishnugupta. Chanakya (375–283 BCE), the counsellor of Chandragupta Maurya, is implied in a later interpolation, reinforced by Gupta-era and medieval traditions, which explicitly identified Kautilya with Chanakya. This identification started during the Gupta reign (c. 240–c. 579), strengthening the Gupta&#x27;s ideological presentation as heirs of the Mauryas. Early on, the identification has been questioned by scholarship, and rejected by the main studies on the topic since 1965, because of stylistic differences within the text which point to multiple authorship, and historical elements which are anachronistic for the Mauryan period, but fit in the first centuries of the Common Era. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; was influential until the 12th century, when it disappeared. It was rediscovered in 1905 by R. Shamasastry, who published it in 1909. The first English translation, also by Shamasastry, was published in 1915.

The Sanskrit title, &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, can be translated as &#x27;treatise on &quot;political science&quot;&#x27; or &quot;economic science&quot; or simply &quot;statecraft&quot;, as the word artha (अर्थ) is polysemous in Sanskrit; the word has a broad scope. It includes books on the nature of government, law, civil and criminal court systems, ethics, economics, markets and trade, the methods for screening ministers, diplomacy, theories on war, nature of peace, and the duties and obligations of a king. The text incorporates Hindu philosophy, includes ancient economic and cultural details on agriculture, mineralogy, mining and metals, animal husbandry, medicine, forests and wildlife.

The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; explores issues of social welfare, the collective ethics that hold a society together, advising the king that in times and in areas devastated by famine, epidemic and such acts of nature, or by war, he should initiate public projects such as creating irrigation waterways and building forts around major strategic holdings and towns and exempt taxes on those affected. The text was influenced by Hindu texts such as the sections on kings, governance and legal procedures included in &quot;Manusmriti&quot;.

==Structure, dating, and authorship ==
The authorship and date of writing are unknown, and there is evidence that the surviving manuscripts are not original, and are based on texts which were modified and edited in their history, but were most likely completed in the available form between the 1st and 3rd century CE. Olivelle states that the surviving manuscripts of the Arthashastra are the product of a transmission that has involved at least three major overlapping divisions or layers, which together consist of 15 books, 150 chapters and 180 topics.

===History of the manuscripts===
The &quot;Arthasastra&quot; is mentioned and dozens of its verses have been found on fragments of manuscript treatises buried in ancient Buddhist monasteries of northwest China, Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan. This includes the Spitzer Manuscript (c. 200 CE) discovered near Kizil in China and the birch bark scrolls now a part of the Bajaur Collection (1st to 2nd century CE) discovered in the ruins of a Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Buddhist site in 1999, state Harry Falk and Ingo Strauch.

The text was considered lost by colonial era scholars, until a manuscript was discovered in 1905. A copy of the Arthashastra in Sanskrit, written on palm leaves, was presented by a Tamil Brahmin from Thanjavur to the newly opened Mysore Oriental Library headed by Benjamin Lewis Rice. The text was identified by the librarian Rudrapatna Shamasastry as the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;. During 1905–1909, Shamasastry published English translations of the text in installments, in journals &quot;Indian Antiquary&quot; and &quot;Mysore Review&quot;.

During 1923–1924, Julius Jolly and Richard Schmidt published a new edition of the text, which was based on a Malayalam script manuscript in the Bavarian State Library. In the 1950s, fragmented sections of a north Indian version of &quot;Arthashastra&quot; were discovered in form of a Devanagari manuscript in a Jain library in Patan, Gujarat. A new edition based on this manuscript was published by Muni Jina Vijay in 1959. In 1960, R. P. Kangle published a critical edition of the text, based on all the available manuscripts. Numerous translations and interpretations of the text have been published since then.

The text written in Sanskrit of the 1st millennium BCE Sanskrit, which is coded, dense and capable of many interpretations, especially as English and Sanskrit are very different languages, both grammatically and syntactically. Patrick Olivelle, whose translation was published in 2013 by Oxford University Press, said it was the &quot;most difficult translation project I have ever undertaken.&quot; Parts of the text are still opaque after a century of modern scholarship.

===Translation of the title===
Different scholars have translated the word &quot;arthashastra&quot; in different ways.

* R.P. Kangle: &quot;Artha is the sustenance or livelihood of men, and is the science of the means to Artha&quot; &quot;science of politics&quot;;
* A.L. Basham: a &quot;treatise on polity&quot;
* D.D. Kosambi: &quot;science of material gain&quot;
* G.P. Singh: &quot;science of polity&quot;
* Roger Boesche: &quot;science of political economy&quot;
* Patrick Olivelle: &quot;science of politics&quot;

Artha (prosperity, wealth, purpose, meaning, economic security) is one of the four aims of human life in Hinduism (Puruṣārtha), the others being dharma (laws, duties, rights, virtues, right way of living), kama (pleasure, emotions, sex) and moksha (spiritual liberation).  is the Sanskrit word for &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;science&quot;.

===Structure===
The first chapter of the first book is a table of contents, while the last chapter of the last book is a short 73 verse epilogue asserting that all thirty-two &quot;Yukti&quot;–elements of correct reasoning methods were deployed to create the text; both were probably later added to the original text.
A notable structure of the treatise is that while all chapters are primarily prose, each transitions into a poetic verse towards its end, as a marker, a style that is found in many ancient Hindu Sanskrit texts where the changing poetic meter or style of writing is used as a syntax code to silently signal that the chapter or section is ending. All 150 chapters of the text also end with a colophon stating the title of the book it belongs in, the topics contained in that book (like an index), the total number of titles in the book and the books in the text. Finally, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; text numbers it 180 topics consecutively, and does not restart from one when a new chapter or a new book starts. The topics are unevenly divided over the chapers, with some chapers containing multiple topics, and some topics spread over multiple chapters; a peculiarity which betrays extensive redaction, with the division into chapters as a later addition, as argued by Winternitz, Keith, Trautmann, McClish, and Olivelle.

The division into 15, 150, and 180 of books, chapters and topics respectively was probably not accidental, states Olivelle, because ancient authors of major Hindu texts favor certain numbers, such as 18 Parvas in the epic Mahabharata. The largest book is the second, with 1,285 sentences, while the smallest is eleventh, with 56 sentences. The entire book has about 5,300 sentences on politics, governance, welfare, economics, protecting key officials and king, gathering intelligence about hostile states, forming strategic alliances, and conduct of war, exclusive of its table of contents and the last epilogue-style book.

===Translations and scholarship===
The text has been translated and interpreted by Shamashastry (translation, 1909), R.P. Kangle (translation 1969, textual analysis 1965), Dieter Schlingloff (historical background, 1965, 1967, and 1969), Scharfe (textual analysis, 1968), Trautmann (textual analysis, 1971), Rangarajan (translation, 1992), Patrick Olivelle (textual analysis 2004, translation 2013), and McClish (textual analysis 2009, 2014, 2019), and a selection of Arthashastra-texts by Olivelle and McClish (2012).

According to McClish, writing in 2009, three &quot;major recent studies&quot; have been done on the composition of the Arthashastra, namely Kangle (1965), Scharfe (1968), and Trautmann (1971), whereafter &quot;little, if any, major work has been done on the composition of the Arthaśāstra in nearly forty years.&quot; Olivelle published &quot;King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kauṭilya&#x27;s Arthaśāstra&quot; in 2013, &quot;taking into account the latest advances in Kautilya studies&quot;; a translation which, according to Richard Davis, &quot;clearly supplants all other translations of this work into English, including those of Kangle (1977) and L. N. Rangarajan (1992).&quot; Olivelle adds Dieter Schlingloff&#x27;s studies (1965, 1967, and 1969) and McClish&#x27; 2009 PhD-thesis as &quot;groundbreaking studies&quot; since Kangle&#x27;s study from 1965; McClish&#x27; also published in 2019 &quot;The History of the Arthasastra&quot;.

=== Dating, chronology and layers of the text===

====Single or multiple authorship====
Olivelle (2013) notes that there are two issues with regard to its composition: if it was an entirely original work, and if the present text &quot;is the result of emendations and redactions of the author&#x27;s original work.&quot; The first is uncontroversial, as the Arthashastra itself states at its start that it has been composed by drawing together Arthashastras from former teachers. Regarding the second issue, Olivelle notes that even those who argue for a single authorship, agree that the text contains interpolations and glosses; the real issue is if there were on of more major redactions of the original text.

While Kangle stated that &quot;[i]t is not possible to point out any substantial parts of the present work as belonging to a later age or as the work of a later hand,&quot; early on philologists and text critics have proposed that the Arthashastra consisted of multiple layers of redaction. Stylistic differences within some sections of the surviving manuscripts suggest that it likely includes the work of several authors over the centuries. There is also no doubt, states Olivelle, that &quot;revisions, errors, additions and perhaps even subtractions have occurred&quot; in Arthashastra since its final redaction in 300 CE or earlier. McClish:
To this, Trautmann and Olivelle add the diverse vocubalaries used within the Arthashastra.

====Overview of scholarly treatments====
According to Kangle (1965), echoing Kane (1926), after judging the arguments against the attribution to Chanakya: &quot;We may, therefore, conclude that there is no convincing reason why this work should not be regarded as the work of Kauṭilya, who helped Candragupta to come to power in Magadha.&quot;

Accordin to Schlingloff (1967), &quot;The traditional attribution to the minister Kautilya [Chanakya] is hardly historical, and the compendium probably arose in the first half of the first millennium AD.&quot;

Hartmut Scharfe argued in 1968 that &quot;the extant Arthaśāstra is the prose expansion of an earlier verse original,&quot; dating it to c. 150 CE.

Trautmann (1971) conducted a statistical analysis of words used in the text, conclusing that the Arthashastra is a composite work containing the work of multiple authors: &quot;[i]t being shown that the Arthashstra has not one author but several, it follows that it is to be referred to not one date but to as many dates as it has authors.&quot; According to Trautmann, approved by Olivelle, the division into chapters, AS 1.1 with its table of contents, and book fifteen, are the work of &quot;a later, tidying and organizing hand, reworking a text already divided by books and topics, and already possessing an adequate introduction in &quot;Arthasastra1.2.&quot;

Trautmann &quot;provisionally&quot; proposes 250 CE as the date for the compilation of the Arthashastra, pointing to a number of historical elements which make an earlier dating impossible.

Rangarajan (1987), who re-translated the Arthashastra, states in his Introduction that &quot;some scholars have expressed doubt about the authorship of what we now know as Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; and the date of its composition.&quot; Regarding the question of multiple authorship, Rangarajan questions Trautman&#x27;s analysis, pointing to a &quot;uniformity in style&quot; and approvingly citing Kangle that &quot;there is no convincing reason why this work should not be regarded as the work of Kautilya who helped Chandragupta to come to power in Magadha.&quot; Yet, Rangarajan also refers to a dating of 150 CE, stating that &quot; Kautilya’s greatness is in no way diminished if we choose any date between 1850 and 2300 years ago.&quot;

Rangarajan notes that the science of &quot;artha&quot; (material well-being, livelihood, conomically productive activity, wealth) was not developed by Kautilya. He drew from older works, which all are lost, and &quot;Kautilya&#x27;s is the earliest text that has come down to us.&quot; One of the possible reason for the disappearance of these earlier literature on Arthashatra could be the Kautilya&#x27;s comprehensive treatise that made those works redundant, a possibility also mentioned by Olivelle (2013).

According to Olivelle (2013), the initial text had one major revision, and possibly several minor revisions. Olivelle concludes that the oldest layer of text, the &quot;sources of the Kauṭilya&quot;, dates from the period 150 BCE–50 CE, consisting of separate treatises from separate authors, confirming Trautmann&#x27;s analysis. The &quot;Kauṭilya Recension&quot; was created in the period 50–125 CE by a historic person named Kautilya, compiling selections from these texts into a new &quot;shastra&quot;, which was likely titled &quot;Daņdanīti&quot;, &quot;literally the administration of punishment but more broadly the exercise of governance.&quot; By the time of Manu (mid 2nd century) this recension had gained popularity and authority, as it was this recension which was used by Manu.

This recension was redacted into the &quot;Śāstric Redaction&quot; (i.e., the text as we have it today) between 175 and 300 CE, and was a major redaction by a scholar who had a good knowledge of the Dharmashastras, bringing the Arthashastra &quot;more in line with the mainstream of Brahmanical social ideology&quot; and the superiority of the Brahmin &quot;varna&quot;. This author added a division into books and chapters, and also added several books, as identified by McClish (2009). He also expanded short, sutra-like statements into extended commentaries in dialogue form. According to Olivelle, &quot;[t]he artificiality of these dialogues has been noted by scholars,&quot; and disrupt and disfigure the composition. They may have been added to emphasize Kautilya&#x27;s authorship, presenting him &quot;as someone standing in a long line of Arthasastric authorities, someone who has surpassed them all when he composed his &quot;Arthasastra&quot;. According to Olivelle, it was this Sastric readactor who &quot;created an &quot;Arthasastra&quot; out of a Daņdanīti.&quot; With regard to dating, Kalidasa (4th–5th century CE) clearly used this Sastric Redaction.

Olivelle rejects the dating to the Mauryan period, and adds the additional argument, derived from the work of Schlingloff, of the usage of wood for the fortications excavated at Pāṭaliputra, whereas &quot;Arthashastra&quot; 2.3.8–9 forbids this usage in defensive fortications. Olivelle also refers to the coral-argument for the dating of the source-texts; the import of this coral cannot be dated earlier than the first century BCE.

According to McClish (2019), a treatise he calls the Dandanīti was created in the first century BCE by an unknown author, who drawed &quot;together a number of disparate sources pertaining to statecraft, added some of his own material, and forged them into a comprehensive treatise.&quot; Thereafter, possibly in the third century CE, &quot;an individual who called himself “Kautilya” redacted the Dandanīti. Kautilya added a great deal of new material, including the division into chapters and the addition of several books, recast the text in the ideological image of the dharma literature, and renamed it the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya.&quot; The date of the third century is based on a comparison with the Manu Dharmashstra (2nd cent. CE), which appears to have used the &quot;Dandanati&quot;, and not the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which means that the redaction of the &quot;Dandanati&quot; into the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; took place after the second century CE. This is corroborated by the first substantial Sanskrit inscription, dated at the middle of the second century CE. Since the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; prescribes inscriptions in Sanskrit, their absence in the centuries directly after 300 BCE is problematic for the traditional attribution to Chanakya, but fits well with an initial compilation before 150 BCE, and a major redaction after 150 BCE. McClish further notes that &quot;[t]he guidelines provided by the &quot;Dandanati&quot; would have been insufficient to Chandragupta&#x27;s imperial project,&quot; hence, &quot;[t] he &quot;Dandanati&quot; is not an imperial text.&quot; As for the lower limit of the dating, McClish also refers to Levy&#x27;s coral-argument. With regard to the upper limit, McClish too, following Trautman, refers to the disappearance of punch-mark coins in the second century CE, which are mentioned extensively though in the &quot;Dandanati&quot;, which means that it was compiled before this period.

=== Authorship ===
According to Olivelle, &quot;[g]iven the compositional history outlined above, the very question regarding &quot;the date&quot; or &quot;the author&quot; of the &quot;AS&quot; becomes moot. We have to instead seek &quot;dates&quot; and &quot;authors&quot; in the plural for the three major phases of its composition: the sources used by Kauṭilya, the original Kauṭilya composition, and the subsequent Śāstric Redaction.&quot; Regarding the original compilation and its later major redaction, three names for the text&#x27;s compilor are used in various historical sources: &quot;Kauṭilya&quot; or its variant &quot;Kauṭalya&quot;, Vishnugupta, and Chanakya.

====Kauṭilya or Kauṭalya====
The text identifies its author by the name &quot;Kauṭilya&quot; or its variant &quot;Kauṭalya.&quot; According to Olivelle, this person was probably the author of the original recension of &quot;Arthashastra&quot;: this recension must have been based on works by earlier writers, as suggested by the Arthashastra&#x27;s opening verse, which states that its author consulted the so-called &quot;Arthashastras&quot; to compose a new treatise. Olivelle argues that this must be the real name of the author, because many shastra received an epynomic ascription to a celebrated figure, which is not the case with &quot;Kautilya,&quot; a relatively unknown name except as an obscure gotra-name. According to McClish, the original compilation was the work of an anymous author, while the major expansion and redaction was the work of an author called Kautilya.

Both spellings appear in manuscripts, commentaries, and references in other ancient texts; the original spelling of the author&#x27;s name has been extensively debated by contemporary scholars, but was not an isue for Sanskrit authors. Vishakhadatta&#x27;s &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; (4th-8th cent. CE), which uses all three names, refers to Chanakya as &quot;kutila-mati&quot; (&quot;crafty-minded&quot;), where &quot;kutila&quot; (&quot;crafty,&quot; &quot;crooked&quot;) is intended, in which case &quot;the name Kautilya would be a kind of nickname which was given to him on account of the well-known crookedness (&quot;kautilyam&quot;) of his policy.&quot;} However, as Burrow pointed out, such a derivation of a masculine noun from an adjective (&quot;kutila&quot;) is grammatically impossible, and Vishakhadatta&#x27;s usage is simply a pun. The word &quot;Kauṭilya&quot; or &quot;Kauṭalya&quot; appears to be the name of a gotra (lineage), and is used in this sense in the later literature and inscriptions. Nevertheless, Vishakhadatta&#x27;s pun may have had unintended consequences, as later Sanskrit texts supportive of his work omit the name Kautilya, while those with negative views are keen to use it.

====Vishnugupta====
A verse at the end of the text identifies its author as &quot;Vishnugupta&quot; (), stating that Vishnugupta himself composed both the text and its commentary, after noticing &quot;many errors committed by commentators on treatises&quot;. R. P. Kangle theorized that Vishnugupta was the personal name of the author while Chanakya () was the name of his gotra. Others, such as Thomas Burrow and Patrick Olivelle, point out that none of the earliest sources that refer to Chanakya mention the name &quot;Vishnugupta&quot;. According to these scholars, &quot;Vishnugupta&quot; may have been the personal name of the author whose gotra name was &quot;Kautilya&quot;: this person, however, was different from Chanakya. Historian K C Ojha theorizes that Vishnugupta was the redactor of the final recension of the text.

====Chanakya====
A persistent tradition attributes the Arthashastra to the Maurya prime minister Chanakya. The identification is implied at the penultimate paragraph of the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which states, &quot;without the explicit use of the name Canakya,&quot; that the treatise was authored by the person who rescued the country from the Nanda kings,&quot; that is, the Maurya prime minister Chanakya who according to tradition played a pivotal role in the overthrow of the Nanda dynasty.

Several Gupta-era (c. 3rd century CE – 575 CE) and mediaeval texts also identify Kautilya or Vishnagupta with Chanakya. Among the earliest of these sources, &quot;Mudrarakshasa&quot; (4th-8th cent. CE) is the only one that uses all three names - Kauṭilya, Vishnugupta, and Chanakya - to refer to the same person. The &quot;Panchatantra&quot; (300 CE) and Vishnugupta (e.g. Kamandaka&#x27;s &quot;Nitisara&quot; (3rd-7th cent. CE) use the name Chanakya. Dandin&#x27;s &quot;Dashakumaracharita&quot; (7th-8th cent. CE) uses both Chanakya and Vishnugupta ), while Bana&#x27;s &quot;Kadambari&quot; (7th. cent. CE) uses Kautilya. The Puranas (&quot;Vishnu&quot; (400-900 CE), &quot;Vayu&quot; (300-500 CE), and &quot;Matsya&quot; (200-500 CE)) are the only among the ancient texts that use the name &quot;Kautilya,&quot; instead of the more common &quot;Chanakya,&quot; to describe the Maurya prime minister.

Trautmann points out that none of the earlier sources that refer to Chanakya mention his authorship of the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, and Olivelle notes that &quot;the name Canakya, however, is completely absent from the text.&quot; This identification seems to be a forgery from the Gupta period. The Guptas tried to present themselves symbolically as the legitimate successors of the Mauryas, even using the names &quot;Chandragupta&quot; and &quot;Gupta,&quot; a connection also made in the play &quot;Mudraraksasa&quot;, composed in the time of the Guptas. The verse seems to be a later interpolation, and Olivelle proposes that it was an attempt to identify the author of the political treatise, which was followed by the Guptas, with the renowned Maurya prime minister.

Olivelle notes that &quot;Given the later association between the &quot;AŚ&quot; and Cāṇakya, who is regarded as the prime minister of Candragupta Maurya, there has been a trend from the inception of Arthaśāstra scholarship to date the text to the Maurya period.&quot; Several reasons are given for the persistent scholalry attribution to Chanakya, and the a priori dating to Mauryan times. One reason is the reception by Indian nationalists, who saw it &quot;as evidence of a pragmatic and virile tradition of self-rule in India’s past.&quot; According to Trautmann, &quot;[n]ationalist aspirations seemed somehow fortified when the existence of strongly centralized empires and native schools of political theory was shown.&quot; Furthermore, the identification with Kautilya provided &quot;a link to the most powerful dynasty in South Asian antiquity: the Mauryan Empire,&quot; while &quot;[g]iven the absolute paucity of sources for this most intriguing era, many scholars seem unable to resist using the Arthaśāstra as a source for the period, despite a decided lack of supporting evidence.&quot; According to McClish, &quot;the desire on the part of Indologists to possess just such a source seems to have exerted, in general, a strong influence on conclusions about the compositional history of the text.&quot;

====Anachronistic historical elements====
Within a few years after its discovery in 1909, scholars questioned this identification, pointing to historical anachronisms and lack of synchronicity with the Mauryan period. R. P. Kangle, who&#x27;s translation dates from the 1960s, deemed this traditional attribution acceptable, and therefor dates the Arthashastra to Mauryan times. Thomas Trautmann, Olivelle and others reject this identification of Chanakya and Kautilya, as it is incompatible with the dating and multiple authorship. A number of arguments against a dating around 300 BCE have been given since 1915. Burrow (1968), Trautmann (1971), Olivelle (2013), and McClish (2019), give the following overview of anachronistic historical elements:

Small local state: the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; is intended for a small state surrounded by other small states, and not for an extensive empire.

Gems and aloe from Ceylon: Hemachandra Raychaudhuri noted in 1919 that gems and aloe from Ceylon are described as &quot;pārasamudraka&quot;, &quot;from Simhala&quot;; were the text from Mauryan times, it would have used &quot;Tamraparni&quot; for Ceylon, not &quot;Parasamudra&quot;.

Chinese silk: S. Lévi noted in 1936 that &quot;Arthashastra&quot; 2.11.114 mentions Chinese silk, &quot;Cinapatta&quot;, &quot;originating in China (&quot;Cinabhumi&quot;). The Indian name for China is derived from the Ch&#x27;in (Qin)-dynasty, which was established in 221 BCE, post-dating the time of Chanakya and Chandragupta Maurya. This means that the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; cannot be attributed to Chanakya.

Coral: S. Lévi also noted, in 1934, that &quot;Arthashastra&quot; 2.11.42 refers to coral inported from Alexandria. This trade florished in the early centuries of the Common Era. There are no references in Panini and Patanjali, but plenty in sources from the early Common Era. Therefor, &quot;the mention of Alexandrian coral in the &quot;Arthasastra&quot; is irreconcilable with the attribution of it to Canakya.&quot;

Wine and Hunas: &quot;Arthashastra&quot; 2.25.24-25 refers to wine, with an etymology derived from the Hunas, which is impossible for a work from the 4th century BCE.

Greek loan-words: the term &quot;surungā&quot;, &quot;underground passage, tunnel,&quot; is a loanword from Hellenistic Greek &quot;surinx&quot;, which is not used as such before the 2nd century BCE. Likewise, &quot;paristoma&quot; (2.11.98) , &quot;a kind of blanket or carpet,&quot; is a loanword from Hellenistic Greek &quot;peristròma,&quot; not attested before the third century BCE.

Written documents: while the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; often refers to written documents, and treats the composition of written documents in a specific chapter, yet writing did not exist yet in India when the Mauryan empire was founded.

Alchemy and metal-working: there are references to alchemy in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, which is probably a western influence. Also, the level of metal-working described in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; does not correspond with the time of Chanakya.

Civil law: Burrow notes that &quot;The chapter on civil law (&quot;vyavahãra&quot;) represents a state of development on the same level as that in the Yàjnavalkya-smrti , a work commonly assigned to the fourth century AD.&quot;

Sanskrit in royal edicts: Trautmann notes that Book II chapter 10 of the Arthashastra itself refers to the use of Sanskrit in royal edicts, which began in 150 CE, setting an earliest date for the text.

Defensive fortications: according to Megasthenes Pataliputrawas &quot;surrounded by a wooden wall pierced by 64 gates and 570 towers.&quot; Olivelle notes that &quot;&quot;AŚ&quot; (2.3.8–9) forbids the use of wood in defensive fortications of cities because of the obvious danger posed by fire. Yet, while Schlingloff shows that the description of fortifications in the Arthashastra is pretty accurate when compared with archaeological remains, the fortications excavated at Pāṭaliputra, the capital of the Maurya empire, are made of wood,&quot; something which would have been impossible if it was the prime minister of Chandragupta had authored the Arthashastra. &quot;The data on the construction of forts in the AŚ (2.3), therefore, must come from a period later than the Maurya.&quot;

Roman dīnāra: Trautmann notes that one of the earliest texts referring to the Arthashastra, the &quot;Pancatantra&quot;, uses the word &quot;dīnāra&quot; a Roman coin not used in India before the Common Era.

Punched-marked coins: chapter 12 mentions punched-marked coins, which disappeared at the end of the second century, setting the latest possible date for that text.

=== Geography - written in Gujarat===
The author of &quot;Arthashastra&quot; uses the term &quot;gramakuta&quot; to describe a village official or chief, which, according to Thomas Burrow, suggests that he was a native of the region that encompasses present-day Gujarat and northern Maharashtra, in contrast to Chanakya, who resided in northern India. Other evidences also support this theory: the text mentions that the shadow of a sundial disappears at noon during the month of Ashadha (June–July), and that the day and night are equal during the months of Chaitra (March–April) and Ashvayuja (September–October). This is possible only in the areas lying along the Tropic of Cancer, which passes through central India, from Gujarat in the west to Bengal in the east.

The author of the text appears to be most familiar with the historical regions of Avanti and Ashmaka, which included parts of present-day Gujarat and Maharashtra. He provides precise annual rainfall figures for these historical regions in the text. Plus, he shows familiarity with sea-trade, which can be explained by the existence of ancient sea ports such as Sopara in the Gujarat-Maharashtra region. Lastly, the gotra name Kauṭilya is still found in Maharashtra.

===The need for law, economics and government===
The ancient Sanskrit text opens, in chapter 2 of Book 1 (the first chapter is table of contents), by acknowledging that there are a number of extant schools with different theories on proper and necessary number of fields of knowledge, and asserts they all agree that the science of government is one of those fields. It lists the school of &quot;Brihaspati&quot;, the school of &quot;Usanas&quot;, the school of &quot;Manu&quot; and itself as the school of &quot;Kautilya&quot; as examples.
The school of &quot;Usanas&quot; asserts, states the text, that there is only one necessary knowledge, the science of government because no other science can start or survive without it. The school of &quot;Brihaspati&quot; asserts, according to Arthashastra, that there are only two fields of knowledge, the science of government and the science of economics (&quot;Varta&quot; of agriculture, cattle and trade) because all other sciences are intellectual and mere flowering of the temporal life of man. The school of &quot;Manu&quot; asserts, states Arthashastra, that there are three fields of knowledge, the Vedas, the science of government and the science of economics (&quot;Varta&quot; of agriculture, cattle and trade) because these three support each other, and all other sciences are special branch of the Vedas.

The Arthashastra then posits its own theory that there are four necessary fields of knowledge, the Vedas, the &quot;Anvikshaki&quot; (science of reasoning), the science of government and the science of economics (&quot;Varta&quot; of agriculture, cattle and trade). It is from these four that all other knowledge, wealth and human prosperity is derived. The Kautilya text thereafter asserts that it is the Vedas that discuss what is Dharma (right, moral, ethical) and what is Adharma (wrong, immoral, unethical), it is the &quot;Varta&quot; that explain what creates wealth and what destroys wealth, it is the science of government that illuminates what is &quot;Nyaya&quot; (justice, expedient, proper) and &quot;Anyaya&quot; (unjust, inexpedient, improper), and that it is &quot;Anvishaki&quot; (philosophy) that is the light of these sciences, as well as the source of all knowledge, the guide to virtues, and the means to all kinds of acts. He says of government in general:

===Raja (king)===
The best king is the &quot;Raja-rishi&quot;, the sage king.

The &quot;Raja-rishi&quot; has self-control and does not fall for the temptations of the senses, he learns continuously and cultivates his thoughts, he avoids false and flattering advisors and instead associates with the true and accomplished elders, he is genuinely promoting the security and welfare of his people, he enriches and empowers his people, he lives a simple life and avoids harmful people or activities, he keeps away from another&#x27;s wife nor craves for other people&#x27;s property. The greatest enemies of a king are not others, but are these six: lust, anger, greed, conceit, arrogance and foolhardiness. A just king gains the loyalty of his people not because he is king, but because he is just.

===Officials, advisors and checks on government===
Book 1 and Book 2 of the text discusses how the crown prince should be trained and how the king himself should continue learning, selecting his key &quot;Mantri&quot; (ministers), officials, administration, staffing of the court personnel, magistrates and judges.

Topic 2 of the Arthashastra, or chapter 5 of Book 1, is dedicated to the continuous training and development of the king, where the text advises that he maintain a counsel of elders, from each field of various sciences, whose accomplishments he knows and respects. Topic 4 of the text describes the process of selecting the ministers and key officials, which it states must be based on king&#x27;s personal knowledge of their honesty and capacity. Kautilya first lists various different opinions among extant scholars on how key government officials should be selected, with &quot;Bharadvaja&quot; suggesting honesty and knowledge be the screen for selection, &quot;Kaunapadanta&quot; suggesting that heredity be favored, &quot;Visalaksha&quot; suggesting that king should hire those whose weaknesses he can exploit, &quot;Parasara&quot; cautioning against hiring vulnerable people because they will try to find king&#x27;s vulnerability to exploit him instead, and yet another who insists that experience and not theoretical qualification be primary selection criterion.

Kautilya, after describing the conflicting views on how to select officials, asserts that a king should select his &quot;Amatyah&quot; (ministers and high officials) based on the capacity to perform that they have shown in their past work, the character and their values that is accordance with the role. The &quot;Amatyah&quot;, states Arthashastra, must be those with following &quot;Amatya-sampat&quot;: well trained, with foresight, with strong memory, bold, well spoken, enthusiastic, excellence in their field of expertise, learned in theoretical and practical knowledge, pure of character, of good health, kind and philanthropic, free from procrastination, free from ficklemindedness, free from hate, free from enmity, free from anger, and dedicated to dharma. Those who lack one or a few of these characteristics must be considered for middle or lower positions in the administration, working under the supervision of more senior officials. The text describes tests to screen for the various &quot;Amatya-sampat&quot;.

The Arthashastra, in Topic 6, describes checks and continuous measurement, in secret, of the integrity and lack of integrity of all ministers and high officials in the kingdom. Those officials who lack integrity must be arrested. Those who are unrighteous, should not work in civil and criminal courts. Those who lack integrity in financial matters or fall for the lure of money must not be in revenue collection or treasury, states the text, and those who lack integrity in sexual relationships must not be appointed to &quot;Vihara&quot; services (pleasure grounds). The highest level ministers must have been tested and have successfully demonstrated integrity in all situations and all types of allurements.

Chapter 9 of Book 1 suggests that the king maintain a council and a &quot;Purohit&quot; (chaplain, spiritual guide) for his personal counsel. The &quot;Purohit&quot;, claims the text, must be one who is well educated in the Vedas and its six &quot;Angas&quot;.

===Causes of impoverishment, lack of motivation and disaffection among people===

The Arthashastra, in Topic 109, Book 7 lists the causes of disaffection, lack of motivation and increase in economic distress among people. It opens by stating that wherever &quot;good people are snubbed, and evil people are embraced&quot; distress increases. Wherever officials or people initiate unprecedented violence in acts or words, wherever there is unrighteous acts of violence, disaffection grows. When the king rejects the Dharma, that is &quot;does what ought not to be done, does not do what ought to be done, does not give what ought to be given, and gives what ought not to be given&quot;, the king causes people to worry and dislike him.

Anywhere, states &quot;Arthashastra&quot; in verse 7.5.22, where people are fined or punished or harassed when they ought not to be harassed, where those that should be punished are not punished, where those people are apprehended when they ought not be, where those who are not apprehended when they ought to, the king and his officials cause distress and disaffection. When officials engage in thievery, instead of providing protection against robbers, the people are impoverished, they lose respect and become disaffected.

A state, asserts &quot;Arthashastra&quot; text in verses 7.5.24 - 7.5.25, where courageous activity is denigrated, quality of accomplishments are disparaged, pioneers are harmed, honorable men are dishonored, where deserving people are not rewarded but instead favoritism and falsehood is, that is where people lack motivation, are distressed, become upset and disloyal.

In verse 7.5.33, the ancient text remarks that general impoverishment relating to food and survival money destroys everything, while other types of impoverishment can be addressed with grants of grain and money.

===Civil, criminal law and court system===
Book 3 of the Arthashastra, according to Trautmann, is dedicated to civil law, including sections relating to economic relations of employer and employee, partnerships, sellers and buyers. Book 4 is a treatise on criminal law, where the king or officials acting on his behalf, take the initiative and start the judicial process against acts of crime, because the crime is felt to be a wrong against the people of the state. This system, as Trautmann points out, is similar to European system of criminal law, rather than other historic legal system, because in the European (and Arthashastra) system it is the state that initiates judicial process in cases that fall under criminal statutes, while in the latter systems the aggrieved party initiates a claim in the case of murder, rape, bodily injury among others.

The ancient text stipulates that the courts have a panel of three &quot;pradeshtri&quot; (magistrates) for handling criminal cases, and this panel is different, separate and independent of the panel of judges of civil court system it specifies for a Hindu kingdom. The text lays out that just punishment is one that is in proportion to the crime in many sections starting with chapter 4 of Book 1, and repeatedly uses this principle in specifying punishments, for example in Topic 79, that is chapter 2 of Book 4. Economic crimes such as conspiracy by a group of traders or artisans is to be, states the Arthashastra, punished with much larger and punitive collective fine than those individually, as conspiracy causes systematic damage to the well-being of the people.

===Marriage laws===
The text discusses marriage and consent laws in Books 3 and 4. It asserts, in chapter 4.2, that a girl may marry any man she wishes, three years after her first menstruation, provided that she does not take her parents&#x27; property or ornaments received by her before the marriage. However, if she marries a man her father arranges or approves of, she has the right to take the ornaments with her.

In chapter 3.4, the text gives the right to a woman that she may remarry anyone if she wants to, if she has been abandoned by the man she was betrothed to, if she does not hear back from him for three menstrual periods, or if she does hear back and has waited for seven menses.

The chapter 2 of Book 3 of Arthashastra legally recognizes eight types of marriage. The bride is given the maximum property inheritance rights when the parents select the groom and the girl consents to the selection (Brahma marriage), and minimal if bride and groom marry secretly as lovers (Gandharva marriage) without the approval of her father and her mother. However, in cases of Gandharva marriage (love), she is given more rights than she has in Brahma marriage (arranged), if the husband uses the property she owns or has created, with husband required to repay her with interest when she demands.

===Wildlife and forests===
Arthashastra states that forests be protected and recommends that the state treasury be used to feed animals such as horses and elephants that are too old for work, sick or injured. However, Kautilya also recommends that wildlife that is damaging crops should be restrained with state resources. In Topic 19, chapter 2, the text suggests:

In topic 35, the text recommends that the &quot;Superintendent of Forest Produce&quot; appointed by the state for each forest zone be responsible for maintaining the health of the forest, protecting forests to assist wildlife such as elephants (&quot;hastivana&quot;), but also producing forest products to satisfy economic needs, products such as Teak, Palmyra, Mimosa, Sissu, Kauki, Sirisha, Catechu, Latifolia, Arjuna, Tilaka, Tinisa, Sal, Robesta, Pinus, Somavalka, Dhava, Birch, bamboo, hemp, Balbaja (used for ropes), Munja, fodder, firewood, bulbous roots and fruits for medicine, flowers. The &quot;Arthashastra&quot; also reveals that the Mauryas designated specific forests to protect supplies of timber, as well as lions and tigers, for skins.

===Mines, factories and superintendents===
The Arthashastra dedicates Topics 30 through 47 discussing the role of government in setting up mines and factories, gold and precious stone workshops, commodities, forest produce, armory, standards for balances and weight measures, standards for length and time measures, customs, agriculture, liquor, abattoirs and courtesans, shipping, domesticated animals such as cattle, horses and elephants along with animal welfare when they are injured or too old, pasture land, military preparedness and intelligence gathering operations of the state.

===On spying, propaganda and information===

The Arthashastra dedicates many chapters on the need, methods and goals of secret service, and how to build then use a network of spies that work for the state. The spies should be trained to adopt roles and guises, to use coded language to transmit information, and be rewarded by their performance and the results they achieve, states the text.

The roles and guises recommended for &quot;Vyanjana&quot; (appearance) agents by the Arthashastra include ascetics, forest hermits, mendicants, cooks, merchants, doctors, astrologers, householders, entertainers, dancers, female agents and others. It suggests that members from these professions should be sought to serve for the secret service. A prudent state, states the text, must expect that its enemies seek information and are spying inside its territory and spreading propaganda, and therefore it must train and reward double agents to gain identity about such hostile intelligence operations.

The goals of the secret service, in Arthashastra, was to test the integrity of government officials, spy on cartels and population for conspiracy, to monitor hostile kingdoms suspected of preparing for war or in war against the state, to check spying and propaganda wars by hostile states, to destabilize enemy states, to get rid of troublesome powerful people who could not be challenged openly. The spy operations and its targets, states verse 5.2.69 of Arthashastra, should be pursued &quot;with respect to traitors and unrighteous people, not with respect to others&quot;.

===On war and peace===
The Arthashastra dedicates Book 7 and 10 to war, and considers numerous scenarios and reasons for war. It classifies war into three broad types – open war, covert war and silent war. It then dedicates chapters to defining each type of war, how to engage in these wars and how to detect that one is a target of covert or silent types of war. The text cautions that the king should know the progress he expects to make, when considering the choice between waging war and pursuing peace. The text asserts:

Kautilya, in the Arthashastra, suggests that the state must always be adequately fortified, its armed forces prepared and resourced to defend itself against acts of war. Kautilya favors peace over war, because he asserts that in most situations, peace is more conducive to creation of wealth, prosperity and security of the people. Arthashastra defines the value of peace and the term peace, states Brekke, as &quot;effort to achieve the results of work undertaken is industry, and absence of disturbance to the enjoyment of the results achieved from work is peace&quot;.

All means to win a war are appropriate in the Arthashastra, including assassination of enemy leaders, sowing discord in its leadership, engagement of covert men and women in the pursuit of military objectives and as weapons of war, deployment of accepted superstitions and propaganda to bolster one&#x27;s own troops or to demoralize enemy soldiers, as well as open hostilities by deploying kingdom&#x27;s armed forces. After success in a war by the victorious just and noble state, the text argues for humane treatment of conquered soldiers and subjects.

The Arthashastra theories are similar with some and in contrast to other alternative theories on war and peace in the ancient Indian tradition. For example, states Brekke, the legends in Hindu epics preach heroism qua heroism which is in contrast to Kautilya suggestion of prudence and never forgetting the four Hindu goals of human life, while Kamandaki&#x27;s &quot;Nitisara&quot;, which is similar to Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, is among other Hindu classics on statecraft and foreign policy that suggest prudence, engagement and diplomacy, peace is preferable and must be sought, and yet prepared to excel and win war if one is forced to.

=== Foreign Policy ===

In the Arthashastra, Books 7, 11 and 12 have given a comprehensive analysis on all aspects of the relations between states. In the first chapter of Book 6, the theoretical basis of foreign policy are described. This includes six-fold foreign policy and the Mandala Theory of foreign policy.

===On regulations and taxes===
The Arthashastra discusses a mixed economy, where private enterprise and state enterprise frequently competed side by side, in agriculture, animal husbandry, forest produce, mining, manufacturing and trade. However, royal statutes and officials regulated private economic activities, some economic activity was the monopoly of the state, and a superintendent oversaw that both private and state owned enterprises followed the same regulations. The private enterprises were taxed. Mines were state owned, but leased to private parties for operations, according to chapter 2.12 of the text. The Arthashastra states that protecting the consumer must be an important priority for the officials of the kingdom.
Arthashastra stipulates restraint on taxes imposed, fairness, the amounts and how tax increases should be implemented. Further, the text suggests that the tax should be &quot;convenient to pay, easy to calculate, inexpensive to administer, equitable and non-distortive, and not inhibit growth. Fair taxes build popular support for the king, states the text, and some manufacturers and artisans, such as those of textiles, were subject to a flat tax. The Arthashastra states that taxes should only be collected from ripened economic activity, and should not be collected from early, unripe stages of economic activity. Historian of economic thought Joseph Spengler notes:

Agriculture on privately owned land was taxed at the rate of 16.67%, but the tax was exempted in cases of famine, epidemic, and settlement into new pastures previously uncultivated and if damaged during a war. New public projects such as irrigation and water works were exempt from taxes for five years, and major renovations to ruined or abandoned water works were granted tax exemption for four years. Temple and &quot;gurukul&quot; lands were exempt from taxes, fines or penalties. Trade into and outside the kingdom&#x27;s borders was subject to toll fees or duties. Taxes varied between 10% and 25% on industrialists and businessmen, and it could be paid in kind (produce), through labor, or in cash.

=== Pregnancy and Abortion ===

In general, causing an abortion had varying penalties. There was severe punishment for aborting a slave woman. For a woman convicted of murder, the sentence of drowning was executed a month after child birth. Pregnant women were also given free ferry rides.

==Influence and reception==

Based on the misidentification with Chanaya, scholars state that the Arthashastra was influential in Asian history. According to Boesche, writing in 2003, its ideas helped create one of the largest empires in South Asia, stretching (possibly) from the Hindu kush to Bengal on the other side of the Indian subcontinent, with its capital Pataliputra twice as large as Rome under Emperor Marcus Aurelius.

Chanakya&#x27;s patron Chandragupta Maurya consolidated an empire which was inherited by his son Bindusara and then his grandson Ashoka.

===Comparisons to Machiavelli===
In 1919, a few years after the newly discovered Arthashastra manuscript&#x27;s translation was first published, Max Weber stated:

More recent scholarship has disagreed with the characterization of &quot;Arthashastra&quot; as &quot;Machiavellianism&quot;. Kautilya asserts in Arthashastra that, &quot;the ultimate source of the prosperity of the kingdom is its security and prosperity of its people&quot;, a view never mentioned in Machiavelli&#x27;s text. The text advocates land reform, where land is taken from landowners and farmers who own land but do not grow anything for a long time, and given to poorer farmers who want to grow crops but do not own any land.

Arthashastra declares, in numerous occasions, the need for empowering the weak and poor in one&#x27;s kingdom, a sentiment that is not found in Machiavelli. &quot;The king shall also provide subsistence to helpless women when they are carrying and also to the children they give birth to&quot;. Elsewhere, the text values not just powerless human life, but even animal life and suggests in Book 2 that horses and elephants be given food, when they become incapacitated from old age, disease or after war.

===Views on the role of the state===
Roger Boesche, who relied entirely on the 1969 translation by Kangle for his analysis of Arthashastra, and who criticized an alternative 1992 translation by Rangarajan, has called the Arthashastra &quot;a great political book of the ancient world&quot;. He interprets that the text, which he dates to the 1st millennium BCE following Kangle, is grounded more like the Soviet Union and China where the state envisions itself as driven by the welfare of the common good, but operates an extensive spy state and system of surveillance. This view has been challenged by Thomas Trautmann, who asserts that a free market and individual rights, albeit a regulated system, are proposed by Arthashastra. Boesche is not summarily critical and adds:

Scholars disagree on how to interpret the document. Kumud Mookerji states that the text may be a picture of actual conditions in Kautilya&#x27;s times. However, Bhargava states that given Kautilya was the prime minister, one must expect that he implemented the ideas in the book.

===Views on property and markets===
Thomas Trautmann states that the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; in chapter 3.9 recognizes the concept of land ownership rights and other private property, and requires the king to protect that right from seizure or abuse. There is no question, according to Trautmann, that people had the power to buy and sell land. However, Trautmann adds, this does not mean that Kautilya was advocating a capitalistic free market economy. Kautilya requires that the land sale be staggered and grants certain buyers automatic &quot;call rights&quot;. The Arthashastra states that if someone wants to sell land, the owner&#x27;s kins, neighbors and creditors have first right of purchase in that order, and only if they do not wish to buy the land for a fair competitive price, others and strangers can bid to buy. Further, the price must be announced in front of witnesses, recorded and taxes paid, for the buy-sale arrangement to deemed recognized by the state. The &quot;call rights&quot; and staggered bid buying is not truly a free market, as Trautmann points out.

The text dedicates Book 3 and 4 to economic laws and a court system to oversee and resolve economic, contracts and market-related disputes. The text also provides a system of appeal in which three &quot;dharmastha&quot; (judges) consider contractual disputes between two parties, and considers profiteering and false claims to dupe customers a crime. The text, states Trautmann, thus anticipates market exchange and provides a framework for its functioning.

===Book on strategy anticipating all scenarios===

More recent scholarship presents a more nuanced reception for the text.

The text, states Sihag, is a treatise on how a state should pursue economic development and it emphasized &quot;proper measurement of economic performance&quot;, and &quot;the role of ethics, considering ethical values as the glue which binds society and promotes economic development&quot;.

===Realism===
India&#x27;s former National Security Adviser, Shiv Shankar Menon, states: &quot;Arthashastra is a serious manual on statecraft, on how to run a state, informed by a higher purpose, clear and precise in its prescriptions, the result of practical experience of running a state. It is not just a normative text but a realist description of the art of running a state&quot;. The text is useful, according to Menon, because in many ways &quot;the world we face today is similar to the world that Kautilya operated in&quot;. He recommended reading of the book for broadening the vision on strategic issues.

<text>Dumaguete, officially the City of Dumaguete (; ; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Negros Oriental, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 134,103 people. It is the most populous city and the smallest city by land area in Negros Oriental as well as one of the two regional centers in Negros Island Region (the other one is Bacolod).

Dumaguete is a university city with four large universities and several colleges, attracting students of the province and students from across the Visayas and Mindanao. The city is best known for Silliman University, the first Protestant and American university in the country and in Asia. Schools in Dumaguete include 18 public elementary schools and eight public high schools.

Dumaguete is bounded by the towns of Bacong, Sibulan, and Valencia. The power source of the city comes from the geothermal power plant in Valencia.

==Etymology==
&quot;Dumaguete&quot; was coined from the Cebuano word , which means &quot;to snatch&quot;. The word , meaning &quot;to swoop&quot;, was coined because of the area&#x27;s frequent raids by Moro pirates and its power to attract and keep visitors, both local and foreign. In 1572, Diego López Povedano indicated the place as Dananguet, but cartographer Pedro Murillo Velarde in 1734 already used the present name of Dumaguete for the settlement.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Dumaguete City was once settled by datus from Borneo who exiled themselves into the newly established Kedatuan of Madja-as. They participated in a successful war against Chola-occupied Odtojonan in Borneo (The former homeland) as a constituent kingdom of Madja-as (the re-established nation). Eventually, they allied themselves under the nearby Rajahnate of Cebu as the people of Dumaguete adopted the Cebuano language, culture, and customs.

=== Spanish colonial era ===
After the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, the island of Negros was divided into the provinces of Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental by a royal decree executed by Governor General Valeriano Weyler on January 1, 1890. Dumaguete was also made the capital of the new Negros Oriental Province.

In 1898, months after the arrival of Emilio Aguinaldo from exile, the Negros Revolution suddenly broke out. Negros Occidental Province, which was still ruled by the Spanish authorities, eventually surrendered to the Negrense Revolutionary Forces after a battle on November 6. They then began a week-long march which captured Dumaguete on November 24. By this time, the Spanish forces had left the entirety of Negros. The &quot;Negros Republic&quot; was then proclaimed on November 27.

=== American era ===
The American era saw the allegiance of the Republic of Negros grow towards a collaborationist stance as a Pro-American Protectorate amidst the Philippine-American War. The Americans saw the people of Negros as more dependable allies compared to other Filipinos. Therefore, Dumaguete observed the establishment of Silliman University, the first American-founded university in Asia.

=== Japanese occupation era ===
Imperial Japanese forces landed at Dumaguete on May 26, 1942, after the fall of the Philippines, and all of Negros Oriental Province surrendered shortly thereafter. Resistance against the Japanese occupation continued by guerilla groups in the inner mountains, where many native residents had fled to. The local Negrense guerillas attacked the remaining Japanese officials and troops on August 6, 1945, and after their victory, they welcomed combined American and Filipino forces that formally liberated Negros Oriental.

=== Cityhood ===
The City of Dumaguete was formally created on July 15, 1948, under Philippine Congressional Republic Act No. 327, also known as the &quot;Charter of the City of Dumaguete&quot;. This was later amended on June 21, 1969, by Republic Act No. 5797, which clarified and refined the powers and functions of the local government unit in the earlier act.

=== Martial law ===

According to journalist Crispin Maslog who was teaching at Silliman University at the time, Dumaguete was one of the first cities in the country to learn about Marcos&#x27; declaration of martial law on September 23, 1972. Local news station DYSR was able to pick up the news from an Australian broadcast. Elsewhere in the country, media outlets such as newspapers and broadcast stations had already been shut down, but DSYR was able to make the announcement before Information Secretary Francisco Tatad did at around noon. DYSR itself would be shut down later that day.

Maslog recounts that Silliman University in Dumaguete was one of the last four universities in the Philippines to be allowed to reopen for classes, with Marcos himself complaining about instances where members of the political opposition such as Senators Jovito Salonga and Juan Liwag were invited to speak at the university.

In the mid-1980s, the crony capitalism which characterized the Marcos administration had a major effect on the island of Negros in which Dumaguete is located. A sugar hoarding scheme by National Sugar Trading Corporation (NASUTRA) of Roberto Benedicto backfired, resulting in the mass-firing of sugar workers in Negros Oriental and Negros Occidental. Worsened by the economic nosedive which had begun in 1983, it eventually became known as the 1985 Negros famine.

==Geography and environment==
Dumaguete has a land area of , situated on the plains of the southeastern coast of the large island of Negros, near the mouth of the Banica River. Of the province&#x27;s 19 municipalities and 6 cities, Dumaguete is the smallest in terms of land area. It is bounded on the north by Sibulan, south by Bacong, and west by Valencia.

As a coastal city, it is bounded on the east by the Bohol Sea and the Tañon Strait, serving as a natural border of the southeastern border of Negros Oriental. The city&#x27;s topography is generally flat from two to six kilometers from the shoreline. It slopes gently upwards to the adjoining municipality of Valencia. The highest ground elevation is located at the boundary of the municipality of Valencia, about one hundred meters above mean sea level. About 93% of the land have slopes of less than 3%. The remaining areas have a 3% to 5% slope.

===Climate===
Dumaguete has a tropical monsoon climate according to the Köppen Climate classification with two distinct seasons: wet and dry. The wet season covers the period from June to November, and the dry season starts from December to May, the hottest being April and May. The average maximum temperature is 30.9 °C and the average minimum temperature is 24.8 °C for the 1991-2020 normals. The relative humidity of the locality for the past years was 81% with January registering the highest.

Northeast monsoon winds (amihan) bring cooler temperatures with little sometimes moderate rain to the city during late October until early March. Trade winds from the Pacific help moderate the sultry conditions of the dry season during April and May, and usually record less hot daytime conditions than the rest of the country; yet nearby warm seas also cause warm and humid nights during this time. When no major wind system is in power, trade winds can occur all year round, providing similar conditions. Southwest monsoon winds (habagat) usually bring overcast and rainy conditions from June to early October, but can also bring the hottest temperatures of the year due to the foehn effect; nevertheless, skies are usually clear that nights feel cool, having the widest temperature variation in a day at this time.

=== Environment ===
Dumaguete has a rich and unique marine ecosystem that provides livelihoods to fishers and supports tourism. The coastal environment, which includes seagrass meadows, acts as efficient carbon sinks that mitigate the effects of climate change. This ecosystem includes 36.15 hectares of seagrasses and 36.20 hectares of coral reef. Dumaguete has four marine protected areas covering 104 hectares that host over 200 species of fish.

In 2021, the fragile marine ecosystem was under threat from a proposed reclamation project that was met with opposition from youth organizations, church groups, residents, and environmental scientists, including Philippine national scientist Angel Alcala. Later that year, the city government halted the project.

=== Barangays ===

Dumaguete is politically subdivided into 30 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

Most of the barangays are classified as urban. The eight &quot;poblacions&quot; comprise the city&#x27;s downtown area and are assigned by numbers. The smallest barangay is Poblacion 4 with an area of only 5.11 hectares, while the largest is Banilad with 362.71 hectares.











==Demographics==
As of the census in 2020, there are 134,103 people and 32,276 households residing in the city. According to the National Statistical Coordination Board, Dumaguete has the lowest poverty incidence among urban centers in the Visayas. It has an average daylight population of 400,000 people. Dumaguete is the most populous city in Negros Oriental, comprising 9.05% of the province&#x27;s total population. During the 2019 election, its total voting population was 89,193 voters.

The Philippine Retirement Authority, a government agency under the Department of Tourism, has named the city as the &quot;Best Place to Retire in the Philippines for 2018&quot;. Dumaguete is also listed fifth in &quot;Forbes Magazine&#x27;s&quot; &quot;7 Best Places to Retire Around the World&quot;.
==Economy==
The major sources of income in Dumaguete are tourism, the academe, retail, BPO, technology, and IT firms.

Calindagan). Business activities are mostly concentrated in the downtown area.

With the completion of four lanes, the Metro Dumaguete Diversion Road helps decongest the traffic in the main thoroughfares of the central business district from the town of Sibulan down to Bacong. The new highway is expected to economically benefit the city&#x27;s barangays as the new centers for economic growth.

These growing industries have made Dumaguete the hub for shopping, education, finance, IT, commerce, lifestyle, and sports in the province of Negros Oriental.

=== Real estate and infrastructure ===
The real estate industry in the city includes several constructions of condominiums, mixed-use development town centers, and massive horizontal housing projects. Shopping centers such as Filinvest Malls Dumaguete by Filinvest Group, Bayshores Dumaguete, and popular restaurants, bars, and dining strips along Flores Avenue have excellent views of Dumaguete Bay. Filinvest is set to develop the beach area for another vertical residential complex in the coastal barangay of Mangnao through its Futura Shores Dumaguete.

CityMall Dumaguete, a community mall anchored by SM Retail (SM Savemore and Ace Hardware) owned by DoubleDragon Properties, and Cang&#x27;s Shopping Complex are located on the national highway serving shoppers in the north. A public transport terminal with multi-level parking spaces is being built at the back of Robinsons Dumaguete within the Dumaguete Business Park. Joining the existing Dumaguete Business Park are the Lifestyle 8880 District, a commercial complex with hotel and convention center in Daro, and the E.C. Ouano Sr. Complex in Bajumpandan, which is being used for government offices and other facilities.

=== Business process outsourcing ===
Dumaguete&#x27;s outsourcing industry has a range of businesses, such as call centers, publishing, medical transcription, animation, editing, and architectural outsourcing. Dumaguete is listed among Next Wave Cities in the country with over 30 IT, KPO and BPO locators, and has been described as a hub for Business Process Outsourcing and Information Technology.

==Tourism==
Data from the Department of Tourism show that Dumaguete, the province&#x27;s main gateway, and Negros Oriental are listed among the top ten most visited tourist destinations in the country.

=== Historical landmarks ===
Rizal Boulevard is known for its hotels, coffee shops, fine dining restaurants, and bars that were mostly converted from sugar mansions and prominent ancestral houses. The boulevard extension to the north of the Port of Dumaguete is also being developed with new hotels, resorts, restaurants, and bars. The boulevard provides views of Dumaguete Bay and the neighboring islands of Cebu and Siquijor.

Rizal Boulevard also has a promenade where locals and visitors can relax, dine, and exercise. This area, known locally as Pantawan People&#x27;s Park, extends from the Port of Dumaguete to the mouth of the Banica River. Food carts in the Pantawan area sell Filipino street food such as balut, tempura, kikiam, and fishballs. The reclaimed Pantawan People&#x27;s Park is the city&#x27;s newest park located at the southern end of Rizal Boulevard.

The St. Catherine of Alexandria Cathedral is known as the oldest stone church of Negros Island and the ecclesiastical seat of the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dumaguete. The detached 1879 &quot;Campanario&quot;, the belfry on one of the watchtowers of the cathedral, had been used to warn against moro invaders in the 1800 Spanish–Moro conflict. It is one of the oldest heritage landmarks of Dumaguete and Central Visayas. On November 23, 2023, Msgr. Julius Perpetuo Heruela, chair of the Commission on Church Cultural Heritage announced the Important Cultural Property historical marker installation at the Campanario. On May 29, 2024, the National Museum of the Philippines granted P9-M funds for the belfry conservation and restoration of cultural property project. The renovation, reinforcement and retrofitting will be a joint undertaking of the NMP, Diocese of Dumaguete and the local government.

The Dumaguete Presidencia, formerly the city hall, was restored to its original design and is now the branch of the National Museum in Dumaguete. The cathedral, belfry, and museum are all located near Quezon Park, named after the first President of the Philippines, Manuel L. Quezon.

Silliman University&#x27;s Anthropology Museum, located in the university&#x27;s Hibbard Hall, contains archaeological artifacts excavated from throughout Negros and parts of Mindanao.

<text>Pierre Bordage (born 29 January 1955 in La Réorthe, Vendée) is a French science fiction author. He won the Cosmos 2000 prize in 1996 for his novel &quot;La Citadelle Hyponéros&quot;.

Pierre Bordage is one of France&#x27;s best-selling science fiction writers. With more than 20 novels published in just over a decade, his books often touch on the spiritual aspects of society, in a style that combines the best of classic adventure stories with reflection on the future and the present.

Bordage&#x27;s books are bestsellers in France, and have been translated in several European countries (Russia, Italy, Spain, Slovenia, Romania, et etc) but there still remains the difficulty of getting published in English, especially in the United States.

He was winner of the 2008 Cezam Prix Littéraire Inter CE for &quot;Porteur d’âmes&quot;.

He was influenced by Philip José Farmer, Robert A. Heinlein, Frank Herbert, Orson Scott Card, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

<text>Hexham is a suburb of the city of Newcastle, about inland from the Newcastle CBD in New South Wales, Australia on the bank of the Hunter River.

==History==

Settlement occurred at Hexham in the 1820s when the land was granted to Edward Sparke. Hexham was named after the market town of Hexham, England with both towns being near to a Newcastle and sharing a history with one another; many of the coal miners from Newcastle upon Tyne and elsewhere in Northumberland moved to New South Wales at the time of settlement.

The history of Hexham is closely associated with that of the nearby suburbs of Tarro (originally Upper Hexham), Ash Island, Tomago and Minmi.

== Geography ==
Hexham measures approximately from north to south and from east to west, covering an area of . The suburb is bordered to the east by the Hunter River - Coquun and by Ironbark Creek - Toohrnbing to the south, while to the west the suburb consists mainly of unproductive swampland and floodplains. Almost all settlement exists within a narrow corridor stretching along the Pacific Highway between the Main Northern railway line and the Hunter River - Coquun. This corridor, which is occupied mainly by highways and industrial areas, covers an area of only . Within the zone residential development is confined to 3 small areas measuring only in total. On Maitland Road there is Hexham Park which has a number of facilities including a cricket pitch, rugby union field, lights, amenities and a grandstand.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Hexham is located at the junction of the Pacific Highway to Brisbane via the coastal route, the New England Highway and is close to the northern end of the Pacific Motorway. The Hunter Valley Dairy Co-operative took advantage of this key location to establish its first milkbar under the Co-operative&#x27;s signature dairy brand Oak to serve locals and longer distance travellers outside its Hexham manufacturing facility. Many years after the closure of the co-operative and the sale of the Oak milk brand Lion to Parmalat, the Hexham manufacturing site now operated and owned by Brancourts is often referred to as the &quot;old Oak site&quot;.

Hexham is located just upstream of the Hunter River delta and its various islands, and as such it was a relatively convenient place for crossing to the north bank of the river. A punt was established in the 1800s, followed by a steam punt, which eventually carried motor traffic. As traffic levels grew after World War I, Hexham became a bottleneck for road traffic. A decision was made in the late 1930s to construct a bridge, however construction was delayed by World War II. Eventually the first two-lane bridge was opened in December 1952. The first bridge is a steel truss bridge with a central lifting span, designed to allow shipping to travel upstream. By the 1970s, this bridge was becoming a bottleneck and the decision was made to increase capacity by building a second bridge for all northbound traffic. This concrete high-level fixed bridge was built just upstream of the original bridge (converted to carry southbound traffic only) and was opened in August 1987.

=== Railways ===
Hexham has its own railway station on the Main Northern railway line, served by an hourly NSW TrainLink service between Newcastle and Maitland/Telarah for a majority of the day. It was the riverine terminus of the privately owned Richmond Vale Railway line, an early coal hauling railway from Minmi and Stockrington which crossed the Main Northern railway line at right angles. Coal loading at the wharf ended in 1967 and the railway line to the adjoining workshops was closed in October 1973. The remaining section of the Richmond Vale Railway was closed in September 1987.

=== Shipping ===
Hexham was once a riverport of some importance in the lower Hunter and was known as Port Hunter, dual named Yohaaba. In the colonial days travellers from Newcastle to Maitland could travel to Hexham by boat and then disembark to travel by road to Maitland via Upper Hexham (Tarro), Four Mile Creek and Green Hills, the road being more direct than the river which had many bends after Raymond Terrace. Coal loading at Hexham began about 1850.

One timber wharf was located on the south bank, downstream of the first Hexham bridge. This was originally used by J &amp; A Brown from the mid-1800s to load coal brought by train from Minimi across Hexham Swamp - Burraghihnbihng. As J &amp; A Brown&#x27;s operations expanded coal was loaded at this wharf from their other coal mines. Coal arrived via the Richmond Vale Railway and a right-angle crossing (across the Main North government line) from 1856 until November 1967. Around 1890, this facility was loading cargoes of up to at a rate of per day. Coal for ships with larger cargos was sent from Hexham to other ports using the government rail line. There was a large rail yard called the Hexham Exchange Sidings to allow J &amp; A Brown coal trains to be taken over the government line to Carrington. The Hexham Coal Washery, opened in 1953, remained operating after the coal loader closed. Ship loading at the J &amp; A Brown shiploader ended on 1 November 1967. The last ship loaded was the MV &quot;Stephen Brown&quot;.

A shiploader served by road adjacent the road bridge over the Hunter River - Coquun was constructed by J &amp; A Brown Abermain Seaham Collieries Ltd at their Hexham Engineering Workshops in 1959 for RW Miller. After the merger of RW Miller with Coal &amp; Allied in the mid-1980s, it was used by Coal &amp; Allied to load coal washed at the Hexham Coal Washery destined for Sydney. This loader was closed in 1988 after the closure of the Hexham Coal Washery., The last ship to load there – and after 138 years, the last to load coal at Hexham – was the MV &quot;Camira&quot; in May 1988. and the loader was dismantled soon afterwards..

Another timber wharf had been built in 1829 by the Sparke family for the loading and unloading of goods travelling between Newcastle and Maitland. This wharf was located on the south bank about upstream from the current bridges across the Hunter River - Coquun. This was near the Wheatsheaf Hotel which was originally built in 1827 by Andrew Sparke and later operated by John Hannell, whose tomb is nearby. The loader was built in 1935 for the Hetton Bellbird Collieries and was sold to the Newcastle Wallsend Coal Company in 1956. It was supplied via the South Maitland Railway up to the East Greta Exchange Sidings (near Maitland) and from there via the Main Northern railway line to the Hetton Bellbird Sidings at the loader. It had 10 &#x27;full&#x27; and 5 &#x27;empty&#x27; sidings. The coal was dumped at a dump station and was transferred via conveyor across the main line and highway to a ship-loader.(The company has a depot to the west, across the Pacific Highway and Great North Railway, at the end of what is now Woodlands Road.) After it was constructed, the first Hexham bridge was built in 1952 with a centre lifting span so small ships could travel to this wharf. (Similarly, the Stockton Bridge further downstream was built with a high arch so ships could travel upstream to Hexham by the north channel of the Hunter River - Coquun to load coal at Hexham.) This loader was later taken over by Peko-Wallsend in the 1960s, which also built six coal silos (painted green) on the river bank and conveyors across the railway and highway to expedite loading. The loader was closed in 1972 and demolished during 1976. The MV &quot;Hexham Bank&quot; was the last ship to be loaded at the Peko-Wallsend loader in November 1971, The wharf was demolished by the 1990s.

The ships serving Hexham were small and known as 60 milers, based on the distance they travelled to Sydney carrying coal for gas-making or to the coal depot at Blackwattle Bay. In Hexham&#x27;s later days as a port, ships sometimes ran aground travelling from Hexham.

Milk was also transported by small boats to the Hunter Valley Dairy Co-operative factory after it was opened at Hexham in 1927.

== Industries ==
Hexham&#x27;s central location, with ready access to river, road and rail transport, has made it a key crossroads in the lower Hunter and influenced its industries. Originally it was a site of farming by the Sparke family. As a crossroads, hotels soon followed, with three in operation in the 1800s: the Wheatsheaf, Hexham and Travellers Rest.

Later it was a key locality for coal loading by J &amp; A Brown and the Bellbird-Hetton Colliery. With coal loading came coal washeries and engineering workshops.

Its central location was again important to the establishment in 1927 of a dairy processing factory by the Hunter Valley Dairy Co-operative, which established the Oak milk brand. The site is now owned and operated by Brancourts Dairy; one of the oldest Australian owned and operated dairy companies in Australia.

Hexham&#x27;s central location has seen the establishment of petrol stations, fast food outlets, warehouses and saleyards for heavy vehicles and caravans.

The Hexham Bowling Club provides a range of entertainment services for locals and travellers.

It is also the home of the Free Church of Tonga which is situated on Old Maitland Road.

== Demographics ==
In the , Hexham recorded a population of 157 people.
The median age of residents was 35 years, compared to the national median of 38 years. People aged 65 years and over made up 20.6% of the population, compared to the national average of 17.2%.
The majority of respondents (84.1%) were born in Australia, compared to the national average of 66.9%.

== Mosquitoes ==

The mosquito species &quot;Ochlerotatus alternans&quot; is common in the area and adults, famed for their size and ferocity, are referred to as &quot;Hexham Greys&quot;. The most famous Hexham Grey is &quot;Ossie the Mossie&quot;, (sometimes spelled as &quot;Ozzie the Mozzie&quot;) a large model of a mosquito that sits atop the Hexham Bowling Club sign at the corner of the Pacific Highway and Old Maitland Road in Hexham. The Hexham Bowling Club&#x27;s &quot;retired&quot; bowlers are affectionately known as the &quot;Hexham Greys&quot;. The previous &quot;Ossie&quot; was replaced with a new &quot;Ossie&quot; (pictured) in 2005. Ozzie disappeared from the sign in early February 2010 and was replaced in April 2010.

==Notes==

# The density presented is that of the whole suburb. However, almost all of the population resides in only about , or about 0.7%, of the suburb. Most of the suburb consists of unpopulated swampland with some industrial areas between the Pacific Highway and the Hunter River. The population density of the residential portion of the suburb is much higher at .

<text>The Annals of Human Genetics is a bimonthly peer-reviewed scientific journal covering human genetics. It was established in 1925 by Karl Pearson as the Annals of Eugenics, with as subtitle, Darwin&#x27;s epigram &quot;I have no Faith in anything short of actual measurement and the rule of three&quot;. The journal obtained its current name in 1954 to reflect changing perceptions on eugenics.

==History==
===Annals of Eugenics===

Pearson edited the journal from 1925 to 1933. In a brief valedictory letter published at the time of his resignation, Pearson wrote that he had fallen short of his aspirations, having published only five volumes over eight years due to the limited financial resources of the Galton Laboratory. He reaffirmed his belief that eugenics was worthy as a subject of academic study and as a source of public policy, but warned against hastily adopting eugenic legislation, noting that the field contained too many theories weakly supported by anecdote or opinion. 

Ronald Fisher took over as editor in 1934 and with Humphry Rolleston, Reginald Ruggles Gates and Dr John Alexander Fraser Roberts on the editorial board. The journal focused more clearly on genetics and mathematical statistics.

=== Ethical issues with rejection of an article related to China ===
In June 2021, the &quot;Annals&quot; refused to publish an article, coauthored by David Curtis, its editor-in-chief at the time, suggesting that academic journals should take a stance against China’s human rights violations in Xinjiang. The journal has defended rejecting the piece and claimed that a boycott against China would be unfair and counterproductive (other journals also rejected the piece). It also denied being unduly deferential to China.

<doc id="613836" wikidata="Q765836" url="?curid=613836" title="Hunter River (New South Wales)">
<text>The Hunter River (Wonnarua: Coquun) is a major river in New South Wales, Australia. The Hunter River rises in the Liverpool Range and flows generally south and then east, reaching the Tasman Sea at Newcastle, the second largest city in New South Wales and a major harbour port. Its lower reaches form an open and trained mature wave dominated barrier estuary.

==Course and features==

The Hunter River rises on the western slopes of Mount Royal Range, part of the Liverpool Range, within Barrington Tops National Park, east of Murrurundi, and flows generally northwest and then southwest before being impounded by Lake Glenbawn; then flowing southwest and then east southeast before reaching its mouth of the Tasman Sea, in Newcastle between Nobbys Head and Stockton. The river is joined by ten tributaries upstream of Lake Glenbawn; and a further thirty-one tributaries downstream of the reservoir. The main tributaries are the Pages, Goulburn, Williams and the Paterson rivers and the Moonan, Stewarts and Wollombi brooks. East of Hexham, the river splits into two main channels, separated by the Ramsar-protected Kooragang Wetlands that feeds Milham Ponds, Wader Pond, Swan Pond and a series of smaller wetland pondages. The southern arm of the river also creates Hexham Island, while the northern creates Smiths Island and flows in Fullerton Cove. The two channels converge at Walsh Point, reaching confluence with Throsby Creek adjacent to the Newcastle central business district, before reaching the river mouth. The Hunter River descends over its course from the high upper reaches, through the Hunter Valley, and out to sea.

The Hunter River is subject to substantial flooding, which Glenbawn Dam, near Scone, was constructed to ameliorate. Major floods have occurred on the Hunter including the flood of 1955 that caused devastation to towns along the river, especially Maitland. Severe flooding again occurred in June 2007 and again in 2015.

Towns along the Hunter River, from upstream to downstream, include Aberdeen, Muswellbrook, Denman, Jerrys Plains, Singleton, Maitland, Morpeth and Raymond Terrace.

At Hexham, the river is transversed by the Pacific Highway; while at Singleton and again at Aberdeen, the river is crossed by the New England Highway; and the Golden Highway crosses the river to the north and to the southeast of Denman.

===Hunter Valley===
The Hunter Valley is one of the best routes to the interior of the state with access relatively unimpeded by mountains and other obstacles. It is the largest area of relatively low-lying land near the coast of New South Wales, and owing to the shielding by rugged ranges to its north, is much drier than any other coastal region of the state. Annual rainfall ranges from at Newcastle to only at Merriwa and Scone in the upper reaches. In the driest years rainfall can be as low as at Newcastle and in the upper valley.

Around the Barrington Tops on the northern side of the valley, however, annual precipitation can be as high as , not all of which falls as rain since July temperatures are often below . In the lower areas, summer maxima are usually around and winter maxima around .

Except for the driest parts of Tasmania and a small area of the Monaro between Cooma and Nimmitabel, the Hunter Valley is the southern limit of rich &quot;black earths&quot; (actually black cracking clays). These are the only soils in all of Australia with reasonable levels of soluble phosphorus, with the result that upstream from Singleton very rich pasture land with many thoroughbred horse studs occurs. Around Merriwa and south of Singleton, the soils are very infertile sands more typical of Australia as a whole, and the dominant land use is extensive grazing.

Parts of the Hunter Valley are important for grape growing and wine producing. The Hunter Valley is also one of Australia&#x27;s most important coal mining areas. The Hunter River is threatened by drought, climate change and proposed loss of water due to coal mining. The region is also favoured by thoroughbred horse breeders and stud farms.

==History==
The Hunter River has been inhabited for thousands of years by the Wonnarua Aboriginal people, who called it the Coquun (), meaning &quot;fresh water&quot;. The Lower Hunter River nearer to the coast is the traditional country of the Awabakal people. Both groups spoke a similar language.

The river was first settled by European explorers in the 1790s. In June 1796, fishermen sheltering from bad weather discovered coal there, and the river was initially called Coal River. In 1797, it was formally named the Hunter, after Captain John Hunter who was Governor of the British colony in New South Wales at that time.

Between 1826 and 1836, convicts built the long Great North Road that links Sydney to the Hunter Region.

<text>Serge Brussolo (born 31 May 1951) is a French fiction author.

==Biography==

Born in Paris, Brussolo had a tormented childhood. He studied letters and psychology and wrote his first texts very early, finding inspiration in his misery and disturbed family environment. The blackness of his first novels set the tone for all of his future work.

At the beginning of his career, publishers rejected him because of his style – which, although close to fantasy and science fiction cannot easily be categorised under any genre. He persevered because he could not consider a future without writing. His work was first published in fanzines. His first published text was &quot;The Escaped Prisoner&quot; published in 1972 in &quot;The Wedged Paddle&quot;. This was followed by a great number of novels published in the &quot;Anticipation&quot; and &quot;Presence of the future&quot; series. Another of his works, &quot;Les semeurs d&#x27;abîmes&quot;, won the Prix Tour-Apollo Award in 1984.

His 1992 science fiction novel was translated into English in 2016 entitled &quot;The Deep Sea Diver&#x27;s Syndrome&quot;.

Later he gave up science fiction in favour of other narrative forms, in particular the thriller and the historical novel. His first thriller, &quot;The Vermin&quot;, contained all of the ingredients of his later suspense novels. In his thrillers he denounces the problems of society, in particular that of the United States. To maintain his creative freedom Brussolo works with several publishers whom he puts in competition with one another, relying on the high sales figures his books achieve. He has also published under the pseudonyms Kitty Doom, D. Morlok, Akira Suzuko and Zeb Chillicothe.

==Film adaptations==
In 2003, his novel &quot;A l&#x27;image du dragon&quot; was freely adapted into an animated motion picture, &quot;The Rain Children&quot;, by Philippe Leclerc. In 2009, his best-selling novel &quot;Les Emmurés&quot; was adapted into an English-language film entitled &quot;Walled In&quot;.

<text>Singleton is a town on the banks of the Hunter River in New South Wales, Australia. Singleton is 202km (126 mi) north-north-west of Sydney, and 70 km (43 mi) north-west of Newcastle. As of 2023, Singleton had an estimated urban population of 17,503.

Singleton&#x27;s main urban area includes the town centre, Singleton Heights, Dunolly, Darlington, The Retreat, Wattle Ponds and Hunterview. Surrounding rural villages include Broke, Camberwell, Jerrys Plains, Goorangoola/Greenlands, Belford and Lower Belford.

Singleton is located on the north-eastern part of the geological structure known as the Sydney basin, which borders the New England region.

Singleton is now home to a $100 million dollar lottery winner, the highest in the town’s history.

==History==

The traditional landowners of the land around what is now Singleton are the Wonnarua / Wanaruah people. The Wonnarua / Wanaruah people have occupied the land in the Upper Hunter Valley for over 30,000 years.

Singleton was established in the 1820s. In its early years, it was also called Patrick&#x27;s Plains. The Main Northern railway line reached Singleton in 1863 and was the end of the line until 1869. The town retains many historic buildings, including the original courthouse built in 1841, various large churches and many traditional Australian pubs. The countryside surrounding Singleton contains an unusual number of fine old mansions, reflecting the aristocratic nature of land grants when the area was settled. They include &#x27;Neotsfield&#x27; (1828), the elaborate &#x27;Baroona&#x27; (1829), &#x27;Abbey Green&#x27; (1865) and stunning &#x27;Minimbah&#x27; (1877).

A Telegraph Office was opened in Singleton on 25 February 1861 during the construction of the first telegraph line to Queensland. That Office combined with the Post Office on 1 January 1870. In May 1942, the community celebrated the appointment of the town&#x27;s first female Telegram Messenger – Miss Daphne Lambkins. She was one of the first female Messengers in the Commonwealth.

Singleton was subject to the major flooding of the Hunter River in 1955, causing extensive damage to the town. When the area was being settled, the government originally attempted to create a town at Whittingham in a flood-free area, but the town grew by the river nonetheless. An embankment was constructed following the 1955 floods to help protect the town against any future flooding.

== Baroona ==
It was built in 1829 with property being on 33 hectares. John Larnach built the 1600ha house on land owned by his father-in-law James Mudie. Larnach and Mudie worked together on property with the help of convict labour to create a prominent agricultural establishment producing wool, meat and wheat. He was assigned 64 convicts which comprised 67% English, 25% Irish and a few from Scotland with a median age of 28 years old. A servant set fire to the estate in 1832. In 1893 Baroona was given an addition of a spiral staircase, a card room and a viewing terrace.

=== 1833 Revolt ===
In November 1833 six convicts decided to revolt because of their poor treatment, meagre provisions and floggings. Larnach and Mudie were away from the property at the time washing sheep. The rebels stole clothes, guns, food and horses. They held Emily Larnach hostage with several servants locking them in an outhouse. They also attempted to kill John Larnach but he managed to escape to Henry Dangar&#x27;s house. Five of six men involved the riots were sentenced to death.During the months preceding the revolt nearly two thirds of the convicts had been flogged with one third of them being flogged multiple times. The subsequent trial in December 1833 led to the convicts being charged with stealing from two dwelling houses, shooting with intent to kill, aiding and abetting and an attempted murder. The inquiry produced little evidence of illegal work practice or servants and convicts being overworked.

== Pelerin ==
Located on 30 Edinburgh Avenue on 3370 sqm, Pelerin was built in the 1830s and is a stone-faced two storey building. In 1899 it sustained major storm damage. The home was rebuilt for D H Dight who decided to retain its original name. It has 27 rooms including 5 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, study, and a timber kitchen. It has cedar joinery with 15-inch skirting board with 11-foot ceilings.

== Ardersier House and Garden ==
The house was built in 1871 by Singleton&#x27;s first mayor Alexander Munro. He named his property Ardersier after his birthplace in Scotland. It is a 1.26 ha property located at 48 Maitland Road. In 1981 it was listed in the National Trust. It has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, plus study and an attic of two large rooms.

== Hambledon Hill ==
Completed in 1865, the land was given on a free grant to brothers Edward, Henry and William Nowland in 1824. Located on 535 Hambledon Hill Road, the land is 50 acres and is currently owned by artist Dale Frank. It has 7 bedrooms and 5 bathrooms. It is a two-storey sandstock brick home on stone foundations with hipped slate roof, a deep stone paved verandah, with cast-iron balustrade and French Doors. Last sold in September 2007 for $720,000.

<text>Glenbawn Dam is a major ungated earth and rock fill with clay core embankment dam with concrete chute spillway plus fuse plugs across the Hunter River upstream of Aberdeen in the Hunter Valley of New South Wales, Australia. The dam&#x27;s purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-electric power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Glenbawn.

Glenbawn Dam was created through enabling legislation enacted through the passage of the . The Act appropriated A£ as the estimated cost of construction of the dam.

<text>Essendon () is an Inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s central business district, located within the City of Moonee Valley local government area. Essendon recorded a population of 21,240 at the 2021 census.

Essendon is bounded in the west by Hoffmans Road, in the north by Keilor Road and Woodland Street, in the east by the Moonee Ponds Creek, and in the south by Buckley Street (except for a small section further south bordering Moonee Ponds).

==History==

Essendon and the banks of the Maribyrnong River were originally inhabited by the Wurundjeri clan of the Woiwurrung speaking people of the Kulin nation.

In 1803, Charles Grimes and James Fleming were the first known European explorers into the Maribyrnong area.

Essendon was named after the village of Essendon in Hertfordshire, England. Richard Green, who arrived in Victoria in the 1850s and settled near Melbourne, was a native of Essendon, Hertfordshire, where his father Isaac Green was either owner or tenant of Essendon Mill, and he bestowed the name of his native village on the district in which he had made his new home.

In 1851, the gold rush opened up the Moonee Ponds District with miners travelling along Mount Alexander Road to Castlemaine.

Essendon Post Office opened on 18 August 1856.

In 1862, 169 residents sought the formation of the Borough of Essendon and Flemington.

On 9 January 1871, the Victorian Railways services began between Essendon and Melbourne, following an unsuccessful private railway operating from 1860 until 1864.

In the 1880s, the local Council resisted industrial development in the form of cattle saleyards and brickworks, out of concern for pollution of the Maribyrnong River. Instead it embarked on a program to create, in its upper reaches, a playground for rowers, fishermen and swimmers.

In 1890, a large mansion was built in the town. It was designed by eminent architect R.A. Lawson and built at a cost of £35,000. Originally known as Earlsbrae Hall, it was the home of Collier McCracken, a member of a local brewing family. The building now houses Lowther Hall Anglican Grammar School.

In 1906, the North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company opened its electric tramway system linking Essendon with the city. The company also supplied electric power to the neighbouring suburbs from its power station on Mount Alexander Road, near the intersection with South Street.

<text>Scone () is a town in the Upper Hunter Shire in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. At the 2021 census, Scone had a population of 5,013 people. It is on the New England Highway north of Muswellbrook about 270 kilometres (167.77 miles) north of Sydney, and is part of the New England (federal) and Upper Hunter (state) electorates. Scone is in a farming area and is also noted for breeding Thoroughbred racehorses. It is known as the &quot;Horse capital of Australia&quot;.

==History==

Allan Cunningham was the first recorded European person to travel into the Scone area, reaching the Upper Dartbrook and Murrurundi areas in 1823. Surveyor Henry Dangar travelled through the area, prior to passing over the Liverpool Range above Murrurundi in 1824. The first properties in the area were Invermein and Segenhoe in 1825. The town initially started as the village of Redbank in 1826 and in 1831 Hugh Cameron, a Scottish descendant put forward the name of Scone to Thomas Mitchell. It was gazetted as Scone in 1837 and during the early days was renowned for its large pastoral properties including Belltrees and Segenhoe. Early buildings were St Luke&#x27;s Church, Scone Post Office, the Old Court Theatre (that is now a hall for musicals and plays), and the St Aubins&#x27; Inn.

Scone Shire was merged into the Upper Hunter Shire in 2004, integrating parts of the former Murrurundi and Merriwa shires.

The annual Scone Horse Festival is a celebration of Scone&#x27;s cultural links to equines. It is celebrated during May and includes all manner of activities, including wine tours, Open Days across the numerous horse studs in the area, the Scone rodeo, the Scone School Horse Sports competition, the Black Tie Ball, and a parade in Kelly Street.

The main event is a horse racing carnival featuring the prestigious Scone Cup, one of the richest country racing days in New South Wales and Australia. Small celebrations are also a key part of the festival and include schools, businesses, public events and sports centres. The Horse Festival is also traditionally linked with such events as the Belltrees poetry competition, the yarns night and many other small annual fundraisers and events. Scone also hosts the Inglis Guineas Day, a major race meet, in the middle of May.

The town is also home to some of the very old pony clubs and is known for a happening polo club. Besides these, the region is well known for its dairies and wineries.

== Belltrees Country House ==
Located on Gundy Road and is heritage listed. The property is 23,000 acre farm. In 1830 Hamilton Sempill was granted the land and called Belltree after an estate of an ancestor. After Sempill returned to England, it was owned by explorer W C Wentworth. In 1853, Wentworth sold the estate to the sons of John White. Designed J W Pender for Henry Luke White in 1906. In 1912 it was 160,000 enclosed with 3,200 km fencing and 64 buildings.

Currently on the property there is a homestead built in 1908, St James chapel (1887), the original homestead which is now a museum, a trading store (1837) turned into an office, a shearing shed (1880) and a primary school. Patrick White used the property as inspiration for his novel &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot; (1973). In 1994 the property became the set for the film &quot;A Matter of Honour.&quot;

== St Aubin&#x27;s Arms ==
In 1836 Thomas and Henry Dangar leased 6 acres of property at St Aubin&#x27;s Village from Captain William Dumaresq. It was built in 1837 and is a pub located on 245 Kelly Street. The first name was &quot;The Bird in Hand&#x27; and the first owner was James Briggs until 1838. There was seven rooms with attached attics, and a small paddock and stockyard. In 1838 the pub was owned by George Chivers. In 1840 the pub was robbed by the Jewboy gang. In 1842, John P Wilkie brought the property and renamed it the White Swan Inn. In 1888 the house was built on the property. In 1917 it was put on market but did not sell due to World War I. In 1938 the house was purchased. The property sits on 4 acres of land. It is a brick building with high ceilings, wide verandahs, cedar joinery and an underground cellar. In the 1960s an additional wing was added. The property now has five bedrooms, a library, lounge and dining areas.

== Turanville Estate ==
William Dangar purchased 800 acres and was given permission to purchase the 1800 acres adjacent to the property. It was well known for horse-breeding – producing racehorses and remounts for the Indian Army and attracted clientele from around the world. Built in the early 1870s with 12 rooms and offices. In 1888, a telephone line was installed to connect Turanville to Scone; it was the first connection to Scone from a property. In 1854, Thomas Cook started to work on the property. In 1889, Thomas Cook inherited the property from his uncle William Dangar. After Cook inherited the property, it reached around 10,000 acres; he also built a homestead and gardens. During the 1900s, a new roof made out iron with a front porch was added to replace the shingled one. In 1912, the property was sold to Hugh Corbett Taylor, whose great grandson still lives on the property. In 1938, Helen Ethel Moore and Douglas Hamilton Robertson took over the property. In 1946, a renovation occurred which included demolishing the separate kitchen block and adding a southern wing to the house. In 1963, Jock Douglas Robertson and his Elizabeth took over running the property. Since 2003, Douglas Hugh Robertson and his wife Nicola now run the property.

<text>Archibald Milne Hamilton (1898–1972) was a New Zealand civil engineer, notable for building the Hamilton Road through Kurdistan and designing the Callender-Hamilton bridge system, and the Callendar-Hamilton aeroplane shed of the late 1930s.

== Early life, marriage and children ==

Hamilton was born in Waimate, New Zealand, the son of W.M. and J.S. Hamilton, on 18 November 1898. He was educated at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School. In 1924 he graduated from Canterbury College with a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil) degree.

Hamilton married Bettina Matraves Collier, a medical doctor, in 1934, and they had six children. The second eldest of these was the evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton, and one of their daughters, Mary R. Bliss, who followed her mother by becoming a doctor, achieved some notability for designing mattresses to prevent bedsores in geriatric patients.

== Early career ==

Hamilton worked for the Lyttelton Harbour Board in New Zealand where he designed a wave model for planning port improvements. Next, he worked at the Admiralty, London, designing the Singapore Naval Base.

== Hamilton Road ==

Between 1928 and 1932 Hamilton was the principal engineer of a British-built strategic road across Southern Kurdistan, which ran from Erbil, through Rawandiz, to the Iranian border near modern-day Piranshahr. The road became known as the Hamilton Road. Although Hamilton hoped the road would unite the peoples of the region, it has been fought over many times. He described the building of the road in a 1937 book entitled &quot;Road through Kurdistan&quot;.

== Callender-Hamilton Bridge ==
During the construction of the road, Hamilton became aware of the need for strong, adaptable bridges with components that could easily be transported and erected in remote and/or difficult terrain. With British Insulated Callenders Cables, now Balfour Beatty Power Networks Ltd, he designed the Callender-Hamilton bridge system, the income from which helped support his family. The parts of the bridge were bolted together like a Meccano set, and it was popular with the British Army away from the battle front. The failure of the First World War Inglis bridge led to the development of the Bailey bridge. Hamilton successfully claimed to the Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors that the Bailey bridge had breached his patent. Because the Bailey bridge used a pin joining system similar to that used in the Martel Bridge designed by Lieutenant-General Sir Giffard Le Quesne Martel, Hamilton told the commission the Bailey bridge should be called a &#x27;Martel Mk2&#x27;.

In 1936 the British War Office paid Hamilton £4,000 for the free non-civil use of his Unit Construction Bridge. In 1954 the Commission awarded him £10,000 in respect of the bridges used in South East Asia Command during WW2 in India. In 1955 Hamilton told the Commission that Martel deserved more than the £12,000 that Bailey had received. Martel was awarded £500..

== Callendar-Hamilton Aeroplane Shed ==
BICC also designed an interesting type of transportable aeroplane hangar in the late 1930s for military use. Although not ordered in quantity by the Air Ministry, a number of these Callendar-Hamilton hangars were built in Britain in the late 1930s and early years of World War II. These are easily recognisable from the more numerous contemporary Bellman and T-type hangars by their intricate internal framework and external overhead door rails. Preserved examples – now listed – of these hangars can be seen today at the Museum of Flight at East Fortune near Edinburgh.

<text>Niddrie is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Moonee Valley local government area. Niddrie recorded a population of 5,901 at the 2021 census.

Niddrie is bounded by the Calder Freeway to the north, Steele Creek to the west, Hoffmans Road to the east and Rosehill Road to the south.

==History==

Niddrie and the banks of the Maribyrnong River were originally inhabited by the Wurundjeri clan of the Kulin nation.

Between 1843 and 1851, the Scottish settler, Thomas Napier (1802–1881) purchased the Keilor Road land covering Niddrie and Airport West. In 1869, Napier sold this land to Henry Stevenson (1810–1893). By 1871, Stevenson had built a house he named &quot;Niddrie&quot;, after his birthplace of Niddrie, a suburb of Edinburgh, Scotland. After his death in 1893, the property was transferred to his wife Elizabeth, who sold it to Patrick Morgan eight years later.

A Keilor East Post Office opened on 1 July 1947 and was renamed Niddrie around 1956. The Niddrie North office opened in 1960, though it was known as Airport West from 1974 until 1982.

Though not officially registered as a suburb until 26 May 1994, the Keilor Council initiated this in 1955.

It is also a matter of record that in 1956 the Melbourne Olympic cauldron was built in work shops behind what later became the Ferguson Plarre site in Keilor Road.

==Commerce==

The main shopping centre is located on Keilor Road, which has a number of cafes and restaurants serving surrounding suburbs. The main industries of the suburb are construction (19%), property and business services (18%), retail trade (17%) and manufacturing (13%).

==Transport==

Tram route 59 travels from Westfield Shoppingtown - Airport West (at Matthews Avenue), then runs via Matthews Avenue, Keilor Road, Mount Alexander Road, Fletcher Street, Pascoe Vale Road, Mount Alexander Road, Flemington Road and then terminates at the corner of Elizabeth Street and Flinders Street, Flinders Street station. Catch it at Stop 53 on Keilor Road, Niddrie.

Seven bus routes also service the suburb.

==Landmarks==

The Niddrie Quarry was established in the 1940s to extract basalt for road paving from the vast lava plain that stretches from Melbourne to Mount Gambier. Quarry operations continued to 1975. Since 1975 local residents have waged a campaign against use of the quarry as a waste dump or for landfill. The site was eventually purchased by the Urban Land Corporation in November 2000 for development of new housing estates with the retention of the quarry as a lake. Currently the site is almost fully developed into a residential housing estate &#x27;Valley Lake&#x27;, which has seen the lake retained and redeveloped, and a number of small wetlands established along with newly planted native vegetation.

Steele Creek, with the Steele Creek Trail alongside runs through the suburb and is a tributary of the Maribyrnong River.

To the North-East of Niddrie is a shopping centre named Direct Factory Outlet, or DFO.

==Education==

Within the area there are several schools including Penleigh and Essendon Grammar School, Niddrie Primary School, Essendon Keilor College, Keilor Heights Primary School, Ave Maria College, Rosehill Secondary College, St. Bernards College and St John Bosco&#x27;s Primary.

==Demographics and religion==

The contains a full set of demographic data on Niddrie. Most of the reported data is comparable to the rest of Victoria, but of note, 47.5% of respondents described themselves as Catholics, compared to 23.2% for the whole of Victoria, and 22.6% for the whole of Australia.

<doc id="613855" wikidata="Q4957732" url="?curid=613855" title="Branxton, New South Wales">
<text>Branxton is a town in the Hunter Region of New South Wales, Australia. Branxton is north of Sydney via the Pacific Motorway and New England Highway. Branxton is located mostly in the City of Cessnock, but part of it is in Singleton Shire. 

== History ==
Branxton lies on the Traditional Country of the Wonnarua people. In 1801 William Paterson (explorer) was the first European to sight the area when he travelled up the Hunter River as far as Dalwood. After colonisation, the township was initially referred to as Black Creek, but in 1848, its name was changed to Branxton as the developer believed that the Black Creek would not attract buyers. As settlers took up further land grants the township expanded capitalising on trade from settlers heading further north to settle the Liverpool Plains. By 1860 it was a village of 500 residents, a steam mill, post office, a mechanics institute and four hotels. 1860 also saw the main road being built by the general store, Victoria House. In 1865 a Methodist church was built. In 1871 St John&#x27;s Anglican Church was built. In 1880 the police station was completed.

==Population==
At the 2021 Census the population of Branxton was 2,255, of whom 2,025 were born in Australia, while 151 identified as Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islanders. The most common responses for religion were Catholic 22.4% and Anglican 11.9%, while No Religion jumped from 21.4% at the 2016 census to 32.8%.

At the , Branxton had a population of 1,991.

==Transport==
Branxton is located on the New England Highway between Maitland and Singleton. While the highway passes through the centre of the town, most through traffic bypasses via the Hunter Expressway.

An infamous road sign on one approach to the town states that Branxton has &quot;two cemeteries no hospital&quot;. The sign, erected by the local Lions Club, is meant to act as a deterrent to rule-breaking motorists.

Branxton is located on the Main Northern railway line and has its own railway station, served by NSW TrainLink&#x27;s Hunter line.

Hunter Valley Buses operates three bus routes through the village of Branxton:
* 179: Stockland Greenhills to North Rothbury via East Maitland, Maitland, Rutherford, Lochinvar, Greta
* 180: Stockland Greenhills to Singleton Heights via East Maitland, Maitland, Rutherford, Lochinvar, Greta and Singleton
* 180X: Maitland station to Singleton station via Lochinvar and Greta

==Wine history==
The Branxton region is considered one of the birth places of Australian wine. Located at the northern end of Wine Country Drive, it is the northern gateway to the world-renowned Hunter Valley wine country of Pokolbin and Rothbury.

Winemaker James Busby, widely regarded as the &quot;father&quot; of the Australian wine industry, planted his first grape vines on his property &quot;Kirkton&quot;, located at Belford in the Branxton district. He later sold 600 vines to George Wyndham, who arrived in 1827 after purchasing 2000 acres of land from David Maziere adjoining the Hunter River near to where William Paterson had explored 26 years earlier. His original homestead, Dalwood House, is preserved within the grounds of the modern Wyndham Estate complex is located five kilometres east of the current town. Management was eventually taken over by his son John who expanded the business, bringing it to international acclaim receiving awards at local and international exhibitions, including the Paris International Exhibition of 1867. The Wyndhams named some of their wines after local Aboriginal words such as &quot;Bukkulla&quot;. At the height of Dalwood&#x27;s success, a set of promotional photographs of the vineyard were produced in 1886, which was presented to various local dignitaries, including Queen Victoria.

==Facilities==
Branxton is a busy service township with a supermarket, medical centre, swimming school and an art school.

The town has several different sporting clubs. These include Greta-Branxton Colts Rugby League Football Club, Greta-Branxton Wildcats Soccer Club, Greta-Branxton United Cricket Club, and Branxton District Netball Club. Branxton also has facilities for tennis, croquet, golf and athletics.

There are two primary schools within Branxton; Branxton Public School, and Rosary Park Catholic School. There is no high school in the town, and most students attend high school in nearby Maitland, Singleton or Cessnock.

==Heritage listings==
Branxton has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Northern railway: Branxton railway station
* Dalwood Road: Dalwood House

<text>Jeffrey Philip Hywel John (born 10 February 1953) is a Church of England priest, who served as the Dean of St Albans from 2004 until 2021. He made headlines in 2003 when he was the first person to have openly been in a same-sex relationship to be nominated as a Church of England bishop. Owing to the consequent controversy he stepped down. In the years since, he has reportedly been considered for at least seven diocesan bishoprics across England, Wales and the Isle of Man.

==Early life and education==
John was born in Tonyrefail in South Wales in 1953. He studied at Tonyrefail Grammar and at Hertford College, Oxford, where he gained a first in classics and modern languages in 1975. He subsequently studied theology at St Stephen&#x27;s House, Oxford, and obtained second-class honours. He later undertook a Doctor of Philosophy (DPhil) degree at the University of Oxford, which he completed in 1984 with a doctoral thesis titled &quot;The importance of St Paul and the Pauline Epistles in second century Christian Gnosticism (apart from Marcion)&quot;.

==Ordained ministry==
John was ordained in the Church in Wales: he was made deacon at Petertide 1978 (24 June) by David Reece, Assistant Bishop of Llandaff; and ordained priest the next Petertide (30 June 1979) by John Poole-Hughes, Bishop of Llandaff — both times in Llandaff Cathedral. After a curacy in Penarth he returned to Oxford in 1980 to study for a doctorate in Pauline theology. He became chaplain at Brasenose College. In 1984, he was appointed Dean of Divinity at Magdalen College, Oxford. In 1991 he was one of the founder members of Affirming Catholicism, a group promoting Catholicism within the Anglican tradition. He is also a trustee of the organisation. He also supported the campaign for the ordination of women. From 1991 he was the vicar of Holy Trinity, Eltham, (in the Diocese of Southwark) in south London. In 1997 he became Canon Chancellor and Theologian of Southwark Cathedral.

On 20 May 2003 John was nominated as Bishop of Reading, an area bishop in the Diocese of Oxford. The nomination led to controversy both in the Church of England and the wider Anglican Communion owing to John&#x27;s long-term relationship (beginning in 1976) with Grant Holmes, also a Church of England priest, despite publicly stating that their relationship was celibate. John received criticism on his nomination both for his stance on gay issues and because he had not publicly repented his past sexual activities in such a way as to indicate that they were wrong. A number of conservative Anglican leaders in various countries stated their intention to split from the communion if the consecration went ahead. Concerns over the potential for division led Rowan Williams, Archbishop of Canterbury, to pressure John to step down. On 6 July 2003, he reportedly withdrew his acceptance of the nomination to the bishopric though it later emerged that he had not in fact agreed to do so. By that point, the process of his taking up the role was already quite advanced. These events inspired the creation of Inclusive Church. In spite of the withdrawal of John the differences in views of homosexuality within the Anglican church continued to cause controversy in 2003 following the election of Gene Robinson as Bishop of New Hampshire in the Episcopal Church in the United States.

On 19 April 2004, 10 Downing Street announced John&#x27;s appointment as Dean of St Albans. He was inducted on 2 July 2004.

In 2021, John resigned as dean to become an associate chaplain at St George&#x27;s, Paris. His final service at St Albans was on 14 February 2021.

===Consideration for diocesan sees===
At the end of August 2008, speculation began that John was one of the nominees for the post of Bishop of Bangor in Wales. A series of media reports in August and September 2008 added weight to the story, which drew strong negative reactions from conservative commentators from within the Church of England and in other conservative quarters.

July 2010 saw widespread media reports that John was the Crown Nomination Commission&#x27;s preferred candidate for appointment as Bishop of Southwark in succession to Tom Butler. These reports again attracted wide comment, both in support and in opposition. Subsequent reports suggested that his name had been removed from the list of potential appointees following leaking of the proposal.

He was also reportedly on the shortlists to be appointed Bishop of Exeter in 2013 and Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich in 2014. It has also been reported that he was omitted from the shortlists for Bishop of St Asaph (2008) and Bishop of Sodor and Man (2017) on grounds of his civil partnership.

In 2017, John was again almost elected as a diocesan bishop, this time as Bishop of Llandaff. His candidacy was reportedly supported by a majority of the electors, but not the required supermajority. When no candidate reached that level of support within the required time-frame, the right to elect lapsed to the House of Bishops of the Church in Wales, who stated that no previous candidate would be considered again. Replying to a letter from John Davies (Bishop of Swansea and Brecon), acting Archbishop of Wales, John made a public response accusing the Church of homophobia throughout the process.

In 2018, John was on the four candidate short list for election as Bishop of Brechin in the Scottish Episcopal Church; he was not elected.

==Views==
Following a talk broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in Holy Week 2007, John was criticised by some Evangelical bishops: Tom Wright, Bishop of Durham; Pete Broadbent, Bishop of Willesden; and Wallace Benn, Bishop of Lewes, for denying the Reformed Protestant doctrine of penal substitutionary atonement. Referring to this particular explanation of the Christ&#x27;s crucifixion, John said, &quot;It was worse than illogical, it was insane. It made God sound like a psychopath.&quot; In explaining his own view, he said, &quot;On the cross Jesus dies for our sins; the price of our sin is paid; but it is not paid to God but by God&quot;. He cited Julian of Norwich, a widely admired 14th-century English mystic who asserted that there is no wrath in God.

John has spoken publicly in favour of the introduction of same-sex marriage saying, &quot;If you are gay, then please understand that God made you as you are, and loves you as you are, and if you invite him into your relationship, then of course he will bless you and sustain your love just as much as he blesses and sustains any other marriage.&quot;

==Personal life==
In August 2006, after being in a relationship for 30 years, John and Grant Holmes entered into a civil partnership. Clergy in the Church of England are permitted to enter into same-sex civil partnerships, provided they remain celibate.

<text>Goulburn River, a perennial river of the Hunter River catchment, is located in the Upper Hunter region of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==
Goulburn River rises at the confluence of Moolarben Creek and Sportsmans Hollow Creek, on the eastern slopes of the Great Dividing Range, near the village of Ulan, east of Mudgee and flows generally eastward, joined by twenty-one tributaries including the Munmurra, Krui, Bylong, Bow, and Merriwa rivers and Worondi Rivulet. The river reaches its confluence with the Hunter River, south of . The majority of the course of the river flows through the Goulburn River National Park. The river descends over its course.

==Etymology==
William Lawson explored the area in 1823. Goulburn River was named in honour of Henry Goulburn, a British politician in the 1820s.

<text>British Airways Ltd was a British airline company operating in Europe in the period 1935–1939. It was formed in 1935 by the merger of Spartan Air Lines Ltd, United Airways Ltd (no relation to the US carrier United Airlines), and Hillman&#x27;s Airways. Its corporate emblem was a winged lion.


==History==
On 30 September 1935, Allied British Airways Ltd was formed for the purpose of merging the publicly quoted company Hillman&#x27;s Airways with the private companies of Spartan Air Lines and United Airways Ltd, both controlled by Whitehall Securities Corporation Ltd (WSC), owned by the Hon. Clive Pearson. Its directors were W. D. L. Roberts, Harold Balfour and John DeC Ballardie from WSC, plus John R. McCrindle, Edgar L. Granville and Gerard L. D&#x27;Erlanger from Hillman&#x27;s. On 29 October 1935, the name was changed to British Airways Ltd, and on 11 December 1935 it converted to a public company. Whitehall Securities was joined as investor in the merged airline by banking house Erlangers Ltd, through its Chairman, Leo d&#x27;Erlanger. The combined assets of 37 operational aircraft included Armstrong Whitworth Argosy II, Spartan Three Seater, DH.60 Moths, DH.84 Dragons, DH.89 Dragon Rapides, DH.86As and Spartan Cruisers.

In early 1936, aircraft and services of Hillman&#x27;s Airways were transferred from Stapleford Aerodrome to Heston Aerodrome, the principal base of Spartan Air Lines and United Airways; the single-engined types and most of the DH.84s were then sold. The London to Liverpool services of United Airways were discontinued, and the services between Liverpool, Blackpool, Isle of Man, Belfast and Glasgow were transferred to Northern &amp; Scottish Airways, a sister company. The ownership of DH.89s and Spartan Cruisers was progressively transferred to Northern &amp; Scottish, and the Argosy was withdrawn from use at Stanley Park Aerodrome (Blackpool).

In April 1936 the airline merged with British Continental Airways; the merged fleet continued to operate as British Airways.

On 25 May 1936, the service from London to Cowes and Ryde aerodromes on the Isle of Wight, that was still jointly operated by Spartan Air Lines and Railway Air Services using DH.84s, was transferred from Heston to Gatwick Airport. Gatwick was then undergoing renovation and redevelopment, to include a new terminal and linked railway station, completed in 1937. In 1936, services from London to Paris, Brussels, Ostend, Amsterdam, Hamburg, Copenhagen, Malmö and Stockholm were flown using DH.89s and DH.86s. Four Fokker F.XIIs were purchased from KLM, after attempted purchase and use by Crilly Airways for a London-Lisbon service, and they were employed on the Paris service until sold in September 1936 for intended use in the Spanish Civil War. During 1936, and into 1937, various night mail contracts were operated, using DH.86s and additional two Fokker F.XIIs, two Fokker F.VIIIs, and three Junkers Ju 52s, to Lille, Cologne, and Hanover.

On 7 February 1937, all services were transferred to Croydon Airport, after surfaces at Gatwick became water-logged due to heavy traffic on immature turf and drains that collapsed; some training operations remained there. In March 1937, the first four of seven Lockheed 10 Electras were delivered. On 12 August 1937, Scottish Airways Ltd was formed to merge the operations of Northern &amp; Scottish Airlines with Highland Airways Ltd, and British Airways Ltd held a 50% stake. On 29 May 1938, most aircraft and services were transferred from Croydon to Heston, due to congestion and unpredictable fog, but night mail operations continued from Croydon. On 3 September 1938, the first of nine Lockheed 14s was delivered.

On 15 September 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain flew from Heston to Munich for a meeting with German leader Adolf Hitler at Berchtesgaden. A Lockheed 10 Electra (G-AEPR) of British Airways Ltd was used on that first of three occasions, piloted by C. Nigel Pelly. On 22 September 1938, Chamberlain flew to Cologne for a meeting at Bad Godesberg in Lockheed 14 G-AFGN, flown by Eric Robinson. On 29 September 1938, G-AFGN was piloted by Victor Flowerday on the final trip to Munich, that resulted in the Munich Agreement, Chamberlain&#x27;s widely publicised return at Heston on 30 September 1938, and his subsequent &quot;Peace for our time&quot; speech.

During 1939, new services were operated to Berlin, Frankfurt, Budapest, Warsaw and Lisbon.

==Second World War==
Before the outbreak of war on 1 September 1939, the British government had already implemented the Air Navigation (Restriction in Time of War) Order 1939. That ordered military takeover of most civilian airfields in the UK, cessation of all private flying without individual flight permits, and other emergency measures. It was administered by a statutory department of the Air Ministry titled National Air Communications (NAC). By 1 September 1939, the aircraft and administrations of British Airways Ltd (BAL) and Imperial Airways were physically transferred to Bristol (Whitchurch) Airport, to be operated jointly by NAC. On 1 April 1940, British Airways Ltd and Imperial Airways Ltd were officially combined into a new company, British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), that had already been formed on 24 November 1939 with retrospective financial arrangements.

==Fleet==

<doc id="613867" wikidata="Q609096" url="?curid=613867" title="Goulburn River">
<text>The Goulburn River, a major inland perennial river of the Goulburn Broken catchment, part of the Murray-Darling basin, is located in the Alpine, Northern Country/North Central, and Southern Riverina regions of the Australian state of Victoria. The headwaters of the Goulburn River rise in the western end of the Victorian Alps, below the peak of Corn Hill before descending to flow into the Murray River near Echuca, making it the longest river in Victoria at . The river is impounded by the Eildon Dam to create Lake Eildon, the Eildon Pondage, the Goulburn Weir and Waranga Basin.

==Location and features==

The river rises below Corn Hill on the southwestern slopes of the Victorian Alps, south of near the town of in the Shire of Mansfield. The river flows generally north, then west, then north, then west passing through or adjacent to the regional cities and towns of , , , , Arcadia Downs, before reaching its confluence with the Murray River near Echuca. The Goulburn has 41 tributaries including the Black, Jamieson, Howqua, Delatite, Big, Rubicon, Acheron, Yea, and Broken rivers and the Seven Creeks. The river descends over its course.

In addition to being the longest river in Victoria, the Goulburn also has the highest discharge and the highest annual flow of any river in Victoria. The area surrounding the river is very productive as a result of irrigated agriculture. The Goulburn (Along with the Upper Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers) accounts for 45% of the Murray-Darling Basin&#x27;s total runoff. By contrast, the Darling basin contributes just 31.7% of the basin&#x27;s total runoff.

===River quality===

Much of the flow is extracted, and the river is very heavily regulated, which has strongly affected the river&#x27;s ecosystem. With recent years being some of the driest on record in the basin, there has been even further stress on the river&#x27;s ecosystem. Because of all this there has been much controversy over the construction of the North–South Pipeline, which will pipe of water annually to Melbourne&#x27;s water supply. There are arguments that all the water piped to Melbourne will be saved water, by the upgrade of the irrigation infrastructure in the Goulburn river basin all a part of a food bowl modernisation project. In June 2008 the Murray-Darling Basin Commission released a report on the condition of the Murray-Darling basin, with the Goulburn and Murrumbidgee rivers both rated in a very poor condition in the Murray-Darling basin with fish stocks in both rivers were also rated as extremely poor.

==Recreation==

The Goulburn Heritage River was declared in 1992 in recognition of its unique natural, recreational, scenic and cultural values. In June 2010, the Victorian Government created the Lower Goulburn National Park to protect and enhance the River Red Gum forests in Victoria. Red River Gum forests line the Goulburn River for most of its length, reaching up to in height and live more than 500 years. The trees need periods of flooding and can survive inundation for months. Their seeds are washed onto higher ground during a flood and germinate and grow before the next flood reaches them. Hollows and broken branches provide nesting for galahs, cockatoos, cockatiels and various parrots, while fallen branches provide habitat for other animals.

Additional activities on the river include canoeing, sightseeing and picnicking, swimming, and fishing, with Murray Cod, Golden Perch and Spiny freshwater crayfish found in the lower reaches of the river. In the upper reaches, there are extensive forests of very tall mountain ash and mixed species and may be described as typical trout streams.

==Etymology==
In the Aboriginal Taungurung language, the river has several names: &quot;Warring&quot;, meaning &quot;big or large water&quot;; &quot;Bayyango&quot;, where Thomas Mitchell noted that this word appeared to be a generic word for river, and (also in the Ngurai-illam Wurrung dialect/language) &quot;Omio&quot; with no clearly defined meaning. In the Yorta Yorta language, the river has several names: &quot;Koninner&quot;, meaning &quot;the country at the junction of the Murray and Goulburn rivers; &quot;Gungupna&quot;, with &quot;gupna&quot; meaning &quot;deep waterholes&quot;; and &quot;Gaiyila&quot;, meaning &quot;father of waters&quot;.

Hamilton Hume and William Hovell explored the area in 1824, naming the Goulburn River in honour of Major Frederick Goulburn, the first Colonial Secretary of New South Wales.

<text>Strathmore is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north-west of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Moonee Valley local government area. Strathmore recorded a population of 8,980 at the 2021 census.

Strathmore is bordered by Woodland Street to the south, Bulla Road and Essendon Airport in the west, and the Moonee Ponds Creek to the north and north-east, and Pascoe Vale Road to the east.

The Tullamarine Freeway divides the suburb into northern and southern halves. Strathmore Heights is a small pocket at the far north of the suburb.

==History==

The first land sales in the area of Strathmore were made in 1843 and 1845 in the Parish of Doutta Galla. Major Frederick Berkley St John was the purchaser of the Strathmore North area (Section 23). The other major purchaser (Section 15, Parish of Doutta Galla) covering the Strathmore area was Edward Jones Brewster. Both made significant fortunes from land speculation.

Brewster subdivided and sold of land to Thomas Napier, who occupied the land and left a lasting legacy to the area – the origin of its name. The area of Strathmore was originally called North Essendon. The name of &quot;Strathmore&quot; was first suggested by the Rev. John Sinclair in 1936 and was initially adopted by the church. The name was derived from Thomas Napier&#x27;s Scottish heritage, the Valley of Strathmore, Scotland, close to where he once lived. The name was submitted to Essendon Council in 1943. In 1955 the Victorian Railways changed the name of the station from North Essendon to Strathmore. Strathmore Post Office opened on 1 October 1953.

In 1979, Strathmore was transferred from the City of Broadmeadows to the City of Essendon. In 1994, it became a part of the City of Moonee Valley.

==Landmarks==

Napier Park is a 10-acre (40,000 m2) block bounded by Woodland and Napier Streets, Noble Avenue and Glenbervie Road. It was donated to Essendon Council in 1920 by Theodore Napier, the son of Thomas Napier. It is a carefully preserved woodland block which gives visitors an idea of what the Strathmore Area was like prior to European Settlement. The park includes a stand of River Red Gums (Eucalyptus Camaldulensis). These trees are protected under the National Register of Significant Trees, and their presence is a requirement under the terms of the original gift. There is only one other such stand of Redgums in the Melbourne area.

Boeing Reserve is a large reserve in Strathmore Heights, with two cricket ovals, three AFL ovals and a baseball field. The reserve takes up much of the suburb of Strathmore Heights, and has a large, wooden sculpture at the south end, it also has a function centre, football/cricket/baseball clubrooms, a toilet, drinking taps, several tracks and a playground, as well as a lot of open grass areas.

<text>Brunswick is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Merri-bek local government area. Brunswick recorded a population of 24,896 at the 2021 census.

Traditionally a working class area noted for its large Italian and Greek communities, Brunswick is currently known for its bohemian culture and strong arts and live music scenes. It is also home to a large student population owing to its proximity to the University of Melbourne and RMIT University, the latter of which has a campus in the suburb. Brunswick&#x27;s major thoroughfare is Sydney Road, one of Melbourne&#x27;s major commercial and nightlife strips. It also encompasses the northern section of Lygon Street, synonymous with the Italian community of Melbourne, which forms its border with Brunswick East.

Brunswick takes its name from George IV and the city of Brunswick, Germany, which lay within his ancestral Kingdom of Hanover. It is bordered to the south by the suburbs of Princes Hill and Parkville, to the east by Brunswick East, to the north by Coburg and to the west by Brunswick West.

==History==
===Early history===

The Wurundjeri people were the first people to live in the area of Brunswick. In Woiwurrung language, they called the area Bulleke-bek, which comes from bullek meaning &#x27;flat country&#x27; and bek meaning ground.

White settlement began in the 1830s, with Assistant Surveyor Darke surveying the area under the instruction of Robert Hoddle. North and south boundaries were drawn up, running in an east–west direction between Moonee Ponds Creek and Merri Creek. These boundaries would become Moreland Road and Park Street, respectively. A narrow road was surveyed down the centre to service what were intended to be agricultural properties, which would eventually become the major thoroughfare of Sydney Road. Ten allotments were drawn up on each side of this road, with each block of land running all the way to either Moonee Ponds Creek or Merri Creek. These wide strips of land are still reflected in the current street layout.

The land was sold at auction in Sydney and attracted speculators, many of whom would never see the land they purchased. Only one original buyer, James Simpson, settled on his land. Simpson subdivided his land and marked out two streets, Carmarthon Street (later Albert Street) and Landillo Street (later Victoria Street). Because the land was too marshy he left the area in 1859 with much of the land unsold.

In 1841 two friends, Thomas Wilkinson and Edward Stone Parker, bought land from one of the original buyers. Parker soon left but Wilkinson stayed on and subdivided his land for sale or rent. He marked two roads which would eventually become extensions of the roads marked out by Simpson. Wilkinson named the streets Victoria Street (after Queen Victoria) and Albert Street (after her husband Prince Albert).

Wilkinson&#x27;s office opened in 1846, taking on the name of Wilkinson&#x27;s estate and thus establishing the name of the whole area.

In October 1842, Miss Amelia Shaw became the licensee of the first hotel in the area, the Retreat Inn. The hotel also had a weighbridge so bullock drivers could refresh themselves whilst their wagons were weighed. The establishment was rebuilt in 1892 and renamed the Retreat Hotel; it still stands today.

Also in 1842, work began on a new road along the central surveyors&#x27; division. The road was originally known as Pentridge Road; it led to the bluestone quarries of Pentridge (now Coburg). In 1843, William Lobb established a cattle farm on his allotment and the area became known as Lobb&#x27;s Hill. A laneway down the side of his property, originally called Lobb&#x27;s Lane, would later be named Stewart Street.

In 1849, one of the original land purchasers, Michael Dawson, completed work on an ivy-covered mansion on his property called Phoenix Park. The property was named after Phoenix Park near Dublin, Ireland. Dawson cited his address not as Brunswick but as Philiptown, after a town in Ireland which has since reverted to its original name of Daingean. Philiptown eventually grew into a village along the track which led from Phoenix Park to Sydney Road. This track was later named Union Street.

===Goldrush era===

Henry Search opened a butcher&#x27;s shop in 1850, on the south-west corner of Albert Street and Sydney Road. This was the first retail establishment in Brunswick. By 1851, gold diggers began making their way through the area, on their journey from the populous suburbs of Fitzroy and Collingwood. Brunswick provided a convenient place for lunch, before the diggers reached the beginnings of the roads to the goldfields, near present-day Essendon. A small village sprang up to meet the needs of the travellers, near the present day Cumberland Arms Hotel. The village included a tent market, described as being like a bazaar, where miners could buy goods needed for the goldfields. Brunswick Post Office opened on 1 January 1854.

In 1859, Wilkinson established the area&#x27;s first newspaper, &quot;The Brunswick Record&quot;, which changed its name in 1858 to &quot;The Brunswick &amp; Pentridge Press&quot;.

By 1857, the local population was estimated at 5000. The Brunswick Municipal Council was established in that year at the Cornish Arms Hotel, which still stands. The first municipal chambers were established in 1859 on Sydney Road at Lobb&#x27;s Hill, between Stewart and Albion Streets. The present Brunswick Town Hall is an imposing Victorian edifice built in 1876 on the corner of Dawson Street and Sydney Road, near the centre of Brunswick.

In the 1850s, quarries and a large brickworks established in Brunswick, using the local clay and bluestone, quickly became the largest industry in the area. In 1884 the first Brunswick railway line opened, running from North Melbourne to Brunswick and Coburg. The line ran directly into the Hoffmans Brickworks, reflecting the importance of the brick-making industry to the local community. Prior to World War I, Brunswick was the &quot;brickyard capital of Victoria&quot;. Remnants of the brickyards are still visible in some parts of Brunswick but most of the yards have long been converted to residential housing or parks. A few years later – in 1887 – a cable tram line was laid along Sydney Road.

===Post-goldrush era===

In 1908, Brunswick officially became a city. Textiles became a large industry in the area in the early decades of the 20th century, while quarrying declined with the depletion of reserves. In the latter half of the 1920s, thousands of Brunswick residents worked in the textile and rope manufacturing industries. By 1930, there were 300 factories in Brunswick employing over 6,000 workers. 

&quot;Free Speech&quot; campaigns occurred in Brunswick during 1933, as protestors countered the actions of police who sought to prevent &quot;street meetings&quot; of communists. On 19 May 1933, two incidents occurred on Sydney Road. Large numbers of police officers were in the area to prevent expected street meetings and, when Reginald Patullo was spotted addressing a crowd from the roof of a tram, the police gave chase. As Patullo attempted to evade capture, one of the pursuing officers tripped and shot Patullo in the thigh.

On the same night, a &quot;well-dressed young man&quot; appeared in a cage on the back of a lorry. He used a megaphone to address the crowd and the cage itself bore slogans such as &quot;We want free speech&quot;. Police dispersed the crowd and the young man was eventually freed and then arrested. By June 1933, Brunswick residents and local council members were criticising the police action, and Councillor Wylie stated: &quot;Without any discretion, mounted troopers drove men, women, and children off the footpaths in Sydney road into the path of traffic on Friday nights.&quot;

===Post-World War II era===

In the post-World War II era, Brunswick became the home of a large number of migrants from southern Europe, particularly from Italy, Greece and Malta. More recently, migrants from Lebanon, Turkey and other countries have arrived. The brickworks and much of the textile industry also began to close as gentrification accelerated in the 1990s. Many old buildings were renovated and new residential developments begun during this period.

In 2004, Brunswick and nearby Carlton were the location of several murders in what has been widely reported in Melbourne&#x27;s media as an &quot;underworld war&quot;.

==Commerce==
Commercial activity is mainly centred on Sydney Road and Lygon Street in neighbouring Brunswick East. While separated from the tourist strip in Carlton, northern Lygon Street has a substantial number of restaurants. Barkly Square, extensively renovated in 2014, is Brunswick&#x27;s major covered shopping centre, located on the east side of Sydney Road, close to Jewell railway station, although there is a wide variety of supermarkets to be found all along the Sydney Road strip.

==Demographics==
In the , there were 24,896 people in Brunswick.
* The most common ancestries were English 31.1%, Australian 25.2%, Irish 15.5%, Scottish 10.8% and Italian 10.4%.
* 66.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 3.6%, New Zealand 3.0%, Italy 2.6%, Greece 2.5% and United States of America 1.3%.
* 72.9% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 4.5%, Italian 3.9%, Mandarin 1.8%, Arabic 1.8% and Spanish 1.4%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 61.2%, Catholic 13.8%, Eastern Orthodox 5.6%, Not stated 4.8% and Islam 2.9%.

==Politics==
During the Great Depression in 1933, Brunswick was the site of free speech meetings by members of the Unemployed Workers Movement, who were harassed and suppressed by the police. The young artist Noel Counihan played a significant part in this campaign. A Free Speech memorial was built in 1994 outside the Mechanics&#x27; Institute on the corner of Sydney and Glenlyon Roads to commemorate the free speech fights. Counihan&#x27;s work as an artist and local resident is also commemorated by the Counihan Gallery in the Brunswick Town Hall, at the corner of Sydney Road and Dawson Street, run by the City of Merri-bek.

Brunswick has long been a stronghold of left-wing politics in Melbourne, with the federal and state parliamentary seats held by the Australian Labor Party with very comfortable margins. In the 21st century these margins have been encroached upon by the increasingly popular Australian Greens, who at the 2016 Australian federal election polled a majority of the two-party-preferred vote against the Australian Labor Party in every booth in Brunswick. However, as well as the &quot;mainstream&quot; left, Brunswick and nearby suburbs have for many years been a holdout of other left-wing parties, radical socialists, and anarchists.

In 2018 the Victorian state electoral district of Brunswick elected a Greens member, Tim Read, for the first time. He was re-elected in 2022 with an increased margin of 13.5%, making Brunswick a safe seat for the Greens.

Brunswick falls into the local City of Merri-bek&#x27;s South Ward; at the 2020 election, the South Ward elected two Greens (James Conlan and Mark Riley) and one Labor councillor (Lambros Tapinos). James Conlan would later leave the Greens in February 2023.

The Brunswick Progress Association, formed in 1905, has had an active role in representing residents, particularly on local issues to Merri-bek Council, but also at the state and federal levels.

==Culture==

In the 1980s, Brunswick&#x27;s major nightspot was the Bombay Rock, a notoriously dangerous venue that saw considerable violence between ethnic groups. It was featured in the 1991 movie &quot;Death In Brunswick&quot; and destroyed by a fire in the mid-1990s.

The Sarah Sands Hotel has hosted tours from a number of local and international acts, mostly punk, skinhead, goth or alternative in nature. By 2017, it was again for sale.

Brunswick was the location of the &quot;Brunswick Massive&quot; art collective, which was run by local youths involved in Australian Hip Hop and Electronic Music events.

The Sydney Road Street Party, held annually in late February, is a major event in the suburb, during which a large proportion of Sydney Road is closed to all traffic. The festival is a prelude to the Brunswick Music Festival, held in March, featuring blues, roots, and world music.

==Sport==

Brunswick has two soccer clubs, Brunswick Juventus and Brunswick City, but Moreland United, Moreland City and Essendon Royals also have strong links to the suburb. There are two cricket clubs,(Brunswick Cricket Club, and Royal Park). The Brunswick Cricket Club, located at Gillon Oval, has a long history dating back to the 1860s and for the last 80 years has been part of the Victorian Sub-District Cricket Association. There is a tennis club (West Brunswick, which is actually located at Raeburn Reserve) and three Australian Rules football clubs. The main sites for sporting activity in Brunswick are focused around Clifton and Gilpin Park and the Gillon Oval, though there are many other ovals and pitches around the suburb. A hockey ground is located at Brunswick Secondary College. The hockey ground is owned by Brunswick Hockey Club. The Brunswick Velodrome is in Brunswick East. Brunswick Athletic Club has been operating since 1953, competes in the North West Region of Athletics Victoria and has produced athletes who have represented Victoria and Australia. West Brunswick Football Club, North Old Boys Football Club and North Brunswick compete in the VAFA. Brunswick Netball Club is for all ages. The Brunswick Junior Football Club is based at Gillion Oval, West Brunswick. The North Brunswick Junior Football Club is based at Allard Park, East Brunswick. Both of these teams play in the Yarra Junior Football League. The Brunswick Netball Club is also based at Gillion Oval. The Brunswick Bowling Club is located in East Brunswick at 104-106 Victoria Street. The Brunswick Trugo Club is in Temple Park, at 29 Hodgson Street. Established in 1994, The Brunswick Lacrosse Club (established as Moreland Lacrosse) is based at Fleming Park, with new clubrooms built in 2023 to support its multiple junior and senior teams.

==Facilities and services==
Among the most notable, popular and long-standing of Brunswick&#x27;s community facilities is the Brunswick City Baths in Dawson Street, opening in 1914. After protracted and expensive renovations from 2012, it reopened in 2014 with remodelled change rooms, indoor and outdoor heated pools and children&#x27;s indoor play pool, fitness program rooms, steam room and sauna, spa and gymnasium. It is owned by Merri-bek Council and managed by the YMCA.

The Counihan Gallery is in the Brunswick Town Hall building which also housed the Brunswick Library, part of Merri-bek City Libraries, during the library&#x27;s renovation in 2013–14. Certain municipal administrative functions still operate from the Brunswick Town Hall, while the former council offices are now used by community organisations.

While several of Brunswick&#x27;s schools were sold off by the Kennett Government in the 1990s for private housing, the former Brunswick Secondary College building on Victoria Street was saved and has found a new use as the Brunswick Business Incubator, run by the economic development unit of Merri-bek Council.

Brunswick has a large number of social service agencies, from large Commonwealth corporate providers such as Centrelink, local government services and community-based organisations. Among the most notable are the two services for asylum seekers and refugees, the Asylum Seeker Welcome Centre and Foundation House.

===Education===
The first state-run kindergarten opened in Brunswick in 1907 by Emmeline Pye who worked at the Central Brunswick Training School. 

Brunswick North Primary School in Albion Street is the only government primary school within the boundaries of Brunswick, residents of the suburb have access to four additional primary schools in the vicinity: Brunswick South Primary School, Brunswick East PS (in Brunswick East), Brunswick South West PS and Brunswick North West PS, as well as two Catholic primary schools. There are two government secondary schools (Brunswick Secondary College and the Sydney Road Community School), a Catholic secondary school and a Maronite Catholic college. There is a campus of RMIT University focusing on Textiles and Printing in Dawson Street.

Brunswick East High School, which had been located on Albert Street, was closed permanently due to low student enrolments in 1992 and demolished and replaced by Rendazzo Park and townhouses. It had initially opened as Brunswick Domestic Arts School for Girls in the 1920s.

===Public open space===
The main areas of open space in Brunswick are on its western edge, comprising several recreational areas that almost combine into a single space: the Alex Gillon Oval, Raeburn Reserve, Brunswick Park, Clifton Park and Gilpin Park. These areas are separated by Victoria and Albert Street. The remaining open spaces within Brunswick are small to tiny &#x27;pocket parks&#x27; and reserves. The most notable are Temple Park, Warr Park and Randazzo Park, the latter having won awards for its contemporary landscape design. The southern edge of Brunswick faces directly onto Royal Park and Princes Park, which are large areas of regionally-significant open space in the suburbs of Parkville and Carlton North. Though not actually within Brunswick, there is good access to the Merri and Moonee Ponds Creeks, which are linear open spaces with bike paths along them, in Brunswick East and Brunswick West respectively.

===Places of worship===
Brunswick&#x27;s diverse religious communities have many places of worship. Various Christian denominations have prominent churches, including Anglican, Serbian Orthodox (located in Brunswick East), Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Baptist, and Uniting Church. Other Christian groups with places of worship are the Church of the Latter Rain and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. There are also two mosques and a Buddhist centre. Most of these places of worship are located along Sydney Road or its immediate hinterland.
==Transport==

The area is among the best-served by public transport in Melbourne.

===Bus===
Seven bus routes service Brunswick:
* : Essendon station – Brunswick East via Albion Street. Operated by Dysons.
* : Moonee Ponds Junction – Clifton Hill station via East Brunswick. Operated by Dysons.

===Cycling===
Brunswick itself is relatively flat and is ideal for cycling. Brunswick East is bounded by the Merri Creek Trail, and Brunswick West by the Moonee Ponds Creek Trail, though neither of these can be described as flat. The Upfield Bike Path follows the Upfield railway line from Fawkner, through Coburg and Brunswick, joining the Capital City Trail at Park Street. Streets in Brunswick vary, from too narrow for two cars to pass, to reasonably wide. Not all of the wider streets have cycle lanes, though even riding in lanes in the narrower street often means riding close to parked cars, presenting a significant hazard to cyclists from opening car doors.

===Train===
Three railway stations service Brunswick: Jewell, Brunswick and Anstey stations, all located on the Upfield line.

===Tram===
Five tram routes service Brunswick:
* , which travels along Sydney Road, Royal Parade and Elizabeth Street to Flinders Street railway station, past University of Melbourne campuses, hospitals and the Queen Victoria Market.
* , to South Melbourne Beach, and to Glen Iris, travelling along Lygon Street.
* , which travels through Royal Park and to the city from nearby Brunswick West.
* , traveling down Nicholson Street in nearby Brunswick East past Parliament House and Southern Cross railway station.

==Landmarks and notable places==
The most prominent structures in Brunswick are the heritage listed chimneys of Hoffmann&#x27;s brickworks on Dawson Street. At their base, one of the brick kilns has been preserved, though the remainder of this site has been redeveloped as medium-density attached housing and low-rise apartment blocks. Other landmark buildings are the many churches along Sydney Road like Brunswick Baptist Church, the Brunswick Tram Depot, and the large bluestone warehouses in Colebrook Street.

Of the newer structures, the four new buildings at the RMIT University campus on Dawson Street are of notable contemporary character, each having its own unique architectural style, with two buildings by noted Melbourne architect John Wardle. The Brunswick Community Health Centre, on Glenlyon Road, completed in the late 1980s, presents a collection of eclectic, differently coloured forms juxtaposed on a small site. It was designed by Melbourne architecture firm Ashton Raggatt McDougall, who have since become internationally prominent.

Being one of Melbourne&#x27;s oldest suburbs, Brunswick has a large number of places of heritage significance, in the form of individual buildings as well as urban conservation precincts covering entire streets or substantial parts of them.

==Notable people==
==Sister cities==
* Solarino, Italy
* Sparta, Greece

Brunswick has more Greeks of Laconian origin than anywhere else in Australia. The president of the Greek Community first suggested a sister city connection between Sparta and Brunswick in 1970. The sistership protocols were signed in 1987. A party comprising the Mayor of Sparta and eight dignitaries came to Brunswick for the official function in 1988, at which Talbot Street, (off Sydney Road, one block north of Victoria Street) was pedestrianised and renamed Sparta Place in recognition of the political and cultural link between the two places. In 2005, Sparta Place was significantly remodelled.

<text>Coburg is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Darebin and Merri-bek local government areas. Coburg recorded a population of 26,574 at the 2021 census.

Although most of Coburg is within the City of Merri-bek, a handful of properties on Elizabeth Street, Coburg&#x27;s eastern boundary, are located in the City of Darebin.

Coburg&#x27;s boundaries are Gaffney Street and Murray Road in the north, Elizabeth Street and Merri Creek in the east, Moreland Road in the South and Melville Road, Devon Avenue, Sussex Street and West Street in the west. Coburg is designated one of 26 Principal Activity Centres in the Melbourne 2030 Metropolitan Strategy.

==History==


Prior to European settlement, the area around Coburg and Merri Creek was occupied by the Woiwurrung speaking Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation. The Wurundjeri had a religious relationship to their land, participating in corroborees and sacred ceremonies on Merri Creek.

Coburg was first surveyed by Robert Hoddle in 1837 – 1838, and he recorded that a Mr Hyatt had a sheep station and hut on the east bank of the Merri Creek, near present Outlook Road. Hoddle marked out a 327-acre (1.3 km2) village reserve with two roads for the district: Bell Street West and Pentridge Road, later called Sydney Road. In 1840, the village was named Pentridge by a surveyor called Henry Foot, who lived and worked near Merri Creek. It was named after the birthplace of Foot&#x27;s wife: Pentridge, Dorset, England.

Dr Farquhar McCrae, a wealthy surgeon, purchased 600 acres (2.4 km2) in the area which he called Moreland. In 1841, he also bought land called &#x27;La Rose&#x27; in what is now known as Pascoe Vale South. The house he built in 1842 or 1843 is now known as Wentworth House, and is the oldest known private dwelling in Victoria still standing on its original site and the fifth oldest building in Victoria.

In 1842, the first inn, The Golden Fleece, was built on Sydney Road just north of Page Street. Twenty one farms were in the area by 1849. With the Victorian gold rush in the 1850s, the population of the area grew rapidly. In 1858, water mains from Yan Yean were connected and the first local paper, the &quot;Brunswick and Pentridge Press&quot;, was started. In 1859, the Pentridge District Road Board was formed to get roads built in the area, the start of local government for the area.

Quarrying of bluestone began in the area 1850s, and by 1875 there were 41 quarries in Coburg. In December 1850, 16 prisoners were moved from an overcrowded Melbourne Gaol to a stockade at Pentridge. Prisoners at what came to be called HM Prison Pentridge were immediately put on &quot;hard labour&quot; by breaking up bluestone for road surfaces. In 1867, a public meeting was called to change the name of the district, as residents were stigmatised and embarrassed at living in a suburb principally known for its gaol, Pentridge Prison. Robert Mailer of Glencairn suggested that the suburb name be changed to Coburg, inspired by the impending visit to the colony of the Duke of Edinburgh, who was a member of the royal house of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The government agreed with the proposal and the change was made in March 1870.

The post office opened on 1 August 1853, and the district was renamed Coburg in January 1870.

Sydney Road attracted numerous hotels and commercial premises in the 1860s. Friendly societies soon formed: Manchester Unity (1863), Druids (1867), Rechabites (1868) and a St. Patrick&#x27;s Society in (1870). Coburg later became a Shire in 1875.

The Upfield railway line opened in 1884, and the Coburg railway station was built in 1888. In February 1889, the horse tram service began along Sydney Road. Electric trams started in service in 1916.

By 1899, there were 6000 people in the district. Coburg was gazetted as a borough in 1905, with Thomas Greenwood becoming Coburg&#x27;s first mayor. The Public Hall, built in 1869, was extended in 1909, but was still inadequate for the growing city. The new Town Hall was built and opened in 1923, with further extensions in 1928.

Lake Reserve is a popular picnic spot on the Merri Creek. The land was purchased in 1912, and a weir was constructed in 1915, to form a lake contained by basaltic outcroppings. The reserve was immensely popular, with diving boards, wading pools, kiosk and gardens, and continues to be a favourite picnic spot, also accessed by the Merri Creek Trail.

After World War I, there was significant development east of Sydney Road, with the former East Coburg Primary School opening in 1926, and a Coburg East Post Office opening in 1929 (closing in 1975).

A Coburg West Post Office opened in 1936 and closed in 1979.

The Coburg Magistrates&#x27; Court closed on 1 February 1985.

Coburg High School was closed in 1996 by Jeff Kennett, then Premier of Victoria. The site has been sold numerous times yet still sits empty. After considerable community activity, initially opposed by the Bracks Labor Government, in 2012 the then Liberal State Government reopened Coburg High School on the site of the previously closed Moreland High. It is now a thriving 7-12 High School.

In June 1994, the 72-year-old City of Coburg ceased to exist when it merged with the City of Brunswick to become the new City of Moreland (now City of Merri-bek).

==Population==

67.1% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Italy 4.4%, Greece 2.6%, England 2.3%, Lebanon 2.2% and Nepal 1.9%. 65.3% of people spoke only English at home.

==Culture==

The cultural diversity of Coburg is reflected in many ways – through its local street and music festivals, variety of cafes, bakeries, restaurants and grocery shops stocking ingredients from around the world.

==Commerce==
The main commercial activity in Coburg is the precinct between Coburg railway station and Sydney Road. Coburg has a small shopping mall at the Pentridge Prison redevelopment, and also four shopping arcades on the west side of Sydney Road. Coburg&#x27;s main commercial precinct comprises about 250 shops, a small indoor market, several supermarkets such as Coles and Woolworths and discount stores such as Dimmeys, arranged around large, ground level car parks. In the 1990s, the Victoria Street pedestrian mall was revamped with native trees and bluestone paving and has become an extremely popular place for locals to congregate, enjoying the local cafes. While Coburg Shopping Centre is very busy during the day, its modest number of restaurants, cafes and bars means that it can be quiet in the evenings. The commercial strip of Sydney Road is continuous from Coburg&#x27;s southern neighbour Brunswick, but it has a very different character, having so far remained ungentrified.

<doc id="613874" wikidata="Q313618" url="?curid=613874" title="Otto Wille Kuusinen">
<text>Otto Wilhelm &quot;Wille&quot; Kuusinen (; ; 4 October 1881 – 17 May 1964) was a Finnish-born Soviet politician, literary historian, and poet.

After the defeat of the Reds in the Finnish Civil War, he fled to the Soviet Union, where he worked until his death. He briefly led the Finnish Democratic Republic before serving as Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish SSR.

==Early life and education==
Kuusinen was born on 4 October 1881, to the family of village tailor Wilhelm Juhonpoika Kuusinen in Laukaa, Grand Duchy of Finland, Russian Empire. Otto&#x27;s mother died when he was two years old, and the family then moved to Jyväskylä. In May 1900, Kuusinen graduated from the Jyväskylä Lyceum and entered Helsinki University the same year. His main subjects were philosophy, aesthetics, and art history. Kuusinen was an active member of the students&#x27; union, and during this period he was interested in Fennoman conservatism and Alkioism. In 1902, Kuusinen graduated as a candidate of philosophy.

==Career==

=== Finnish Civil War and flight to the Soviet Union ===

In 1906, after toppling the more moderate party chairman J. K. Kari, Kuusinen came to dominate Finland&#x27;s Social Democratic Party. He was a member of Finland&#x27;s Parliament from 1908 to 1910, from 1911 to 1913 and again from 1916 to 1918 as well as the party&#x27;s chairman from 1911 to 1917. He was a leader of the January 1918 revolution in Finland that created the short-lived Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic, of which he was appointed People&#x27;s Commissar of Education. After the republic was defeated in the Finnish Civil War in 1918, Kuusinen fled to Moscow and helped form the Finnish Communist Party.

Kuusinen continued his work as a prominent leader of the Comintern in Bolshevist Russia, that soon became the Soviet Union. Kuusinen also became a leader in Soviet military intelligence, establishing an intelligence network against the Scandinavian countries. In Finland, a more moderate faction rehabilitated the Social Democrats under Väinö Tanner&#x27;s leadership. Meanwhile, Kuusinen and other radicals were increasingly seen as responsible for the Civil War and its aftermath.

Animosity towards socialists in Finland in the decades after the civil war prompted many Finns to emigrate to Russia to &quot;build socialism.&quot; However, the Soviet Great Purge was a hard blow to Finns in the Soviet Union. Many Finnish communists sympathetic to Trotskyism or social democracy were purged and Kuusinen&#x27;s reputation in Finland was damaged when he turned out to be one of the very few not targeted by Stalinist show trials, deportations, and executions.

=== Head of the Terijoki Government ===

When the Red Army began its advance during the Winter War on November 30, 1939, Kuusinen was pronounced head of the Finnish Democratic Republic (also known as the Terijoki Government)—Joseph Stalin&#x27;s puppet regime through which Finland would be transformed into a socialist state. A &quot;Declaration of the People&#x27;s Government of Finland&quot; was issued in Terijoki on December 1, 1939, and a &quot;Treaty of Mutual Assistance and Friendship Between the Soviet Union and the Democratic Republic of Finland&quot; signed by Molotov and Kuusinen in Moscow on December 2, 1939. However, the war did not go as planned, and the Soviet leadership decided to negotiate a peace with the legitimate Finnish government; Kuusinen&#x27;s government disbanded and he was made chairman of the presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Karelo-Finnish SSR (1940–1956).

Finnish Communist Arvo Tuominen expressed the opinion that the war was not Kuusinen&#x27;s idea. According to him, Kuusinen would have known that the underground Finnish Communist Party was in shambles due to police terror and could not incite a mass revolt in Finland or mutiny in the ranks of the army. The number of soldiers who joined Kuusinen&#x27;s Finnish People&#x27;s Army was up to 25000 Ingrians, Karelians, Russians, and some Finnish émigrés. Kuusinen served as chairman and foreign minister of the Terijoki puppet government, while its other ministers were members of the Finnish Communist Party. The Treaty of Mutual Assistance between the government of the Soviet Union and the Terijoki puppet government, signed in Moscow in December 1939, indicates that the puppet government&#x27;s members were accepted by the leaders of the Soviet Union. The first idea of the Terijoki puppet government might have been expressed to Joseph Stalin by the Finnish Communist Party or Soviet Communist Party secretary Andrei Zhdanov in the beginning of November, because the main secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, Arvo Tuominen, received a letter dated November 13 in Stockholm concerning this matter.

The Finnish Communist Party had little influence during the 1930s and most working class Finns stood behind the legal government in Helsinki. Finnish national unity against the Soviet invasion was later called the Spirit of the Winter War.

=== Politburo member ===

Kuusinen became an influential official in the Soviet administration. He was a member of the Politburo, the highest organ of the Communist party. Despite his close work with Stalin, Kuusinen was able to continue to work during the administration of Nikita Khrushchev (1953–1964) and &quot;de-Stalinization&quot;. He was Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1957–1964. In 1952 and again in 1957 he was also elected to the Presidium of the Central Committee.

In the 1950s, Kuusinen was also one of the editors of &quot;The Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism,&quot; a textbook considered to be one of the fundamental works on dialectical materialism and Leninist communism.

In 1958, Kuusinen was elected a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

After learning that he was terminally ill, Kuusinen requested (via the Helsinki Embassy of the Soviet Union) permission to visit Laukaa and Jyväskylä as a private person. The government of Finland denied this request.

==Personal life and death==

Kuusinen married several times, and had numerous children: &quot;Aino&quot; Elina (born 1901), &quot;Hertta&quot; Elina (born 1904), Esa Otto Wille (born 1906), Riikka-Sisko (born 1908), Heikki (born 1911) and Taneli (born 1913). Most of his offspring remained with his first wife Saima Dahlström. In early 1920s Kuusinen married Aino Sarola. In 1936, he fell in love with an Armenian, Marina Amiragova, who was 30 years younger than him. They stayed together until Kuusinen&#x27;s death and never married. They had a daughter in 1937 who died at the age of eleven months.

Kuusinen died age 82 on 17 May 1964 in Moscow. His ashes were buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis.

He was succeeded by his daughter Hertta Kuusinen, a leading communist politician in Finland during the Cold War.

==Legacy==

Under Kuusinen&#x27;s name came the Comintern concept of a politically organized &quot;solar system&quot; in an influential piece called &quot;Report of the Commission for Work among the Masses&quot; (1926): The first of our task is to build up, not only communist organisations, but other organisations as well, above all mass organisations sympathising with our aims, and able to aid us for special purposes. We have already such organisations in some countries, for instance the International Red Aid, the Workers&#x27; International Relief, etc. Comrade Zinoviev has expressly emphasised the importance of this task in his closing speech. Besides this we require a number of more or less firmly established organisatory fulcrums, which we can utilise for our further work, ensuring that we are not condemned to the Sisyphus-like task of only influencing the masses politically, only to see this mass influence constantly slip through our hands. We must create a whole solar system of organisations and smaller committees around the Communist Party, so to speak, smaller organisations working actually under the influence of our Party (not under mechanical leadership).

The quote &quot;solar system of organizations&quot; was wrongly ascribed to Lenin by U.S. HUAC chief investigator Robert E. Stripling and U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle.

<text>The Macleay River is a river that spans the Northern Tablelands and Mid North Coast districts of New South Wales, Australia.

==Course and features==

Formed by the confluence of the Gara River, Salisbury Waters and Bakers Creek, the Macleay River rises below Blue Nobby Mountain, east of Uralla within the Great Dividing Range. The river flows in a meandering course generally east by south, joined by twenty-six tributaries including the Apsley, Chandler, and Dyke rivers and passing through a number of spectacular gorges and waterfalls in Cunnawarra National Park and Oxley Wild Rivers National Park, through heritage-listed mountain village Bellbrook amidst others, before reaching its mouth at the Tasman Sea, near South West Rocks. The river descends over its course.

The river flows through the town of Kempsey. At the river is traversed by the Pacific Highway via the Macleay River Bridge (Dhanggati language: &quot;Yapang gurraarrbang gayandugayigu&quot;). At the time of its official opening in 2013, the bridge was the longest road bridge in Australia. The river is also traversed by the North Coast railway line.

The Macleay River is liable to flooding in the Kempsey area, on occasions causing great damage. During times of peak flooding, the Macleay River can hold over of water.

==History==
The Dunghutti, an Aboriginal Australian people, are the traditional custodians of the land surrounding the Macleay River catchment and the Apsley River catchment, whose descendants are now concentrated in the lower Macleay River. Stone artefacts and evidence of Aboriginal stone tool-making have been found around the Macleay and Apsley rivers.

John Oxley failed to realise the potential of this river in 1820 as he did not navigate far enough up-river to see the magnificent stands of timber and the fertile land. The river was vaguely referred to as the New River from descriptions given by Aborigines. In 1826 Captain Wright travelled overland from Port Macquarie and explored to the head of navigation at Belgrave Falls, a series of rapids to the west of the present town of Kempsey. It was then called Wrights River. Major Archibald Clunes Innes, Commandant of Port Macquarie Penal Settlement, sent the first government gang of Australian red cedar (&quot;Toona ciliata&quot;) cutters to work there in 1827.

More cedar camps were established on the Macleay during the 1830s and the area was also a haven for escaped convicts. By 1841, about 200 cutters were working on the river area, where violence and theft of logs was not uncommon. Demand and prices dropped in 1842 and cutting along the Macleay diminished although it continued in the upper tributaries. When Europeans arrived in the area around the 1820s the river mouth was just south of Grassy Head, and almost a mile wide with a sand spit in the middle. The small town of Stuarts Point was established on the river just inside to serve arriving ships.

The coastal strip extending from South West Rocks to Grassy Head is a wide delta with various channels connected to the river. Around 1885 English marine engineer John Coode advised on improvements to various rivers and ports in Australia, including the Macleay. The Department of Public Works prepared four plans for improvements to the mouth, Coode favoured improving the existing entrance. In 1893 a flood enlarged an opening near South West Rocks and the department elected to improve that, called the New Entrance, though Coode had thought it not enough to drain all the waters of the district. Work on the new entrance started in April 1896, improving the channel and adding training walls. A new pilot station was built in 1902, establishing the town of South West Rocks. Work was completed in 1906. Today the old mouth has silted up, leaving Stuarts Point on a dead-end reach.

Variously known as Wright River, Trail River, New and McLeay rivers, it was named the Macleay River in honour of Innes&#x27;s father-in-law, Alexander Macleay, Scottish-born scientist and colonial secretary of New South Wales.

<text>Fawkner is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Hume and Merri-bek local government areas. Fawkner recorded a population of 14,274 at the 2021 census.

The major portion within the City of Merri-bek is bounded by Merri Creek on the east, Sydney Road and the Upfield railway line on the west, the Western Ring Road on the north and Boundary Road on the south separating the suburb from Coburg North. The smaller portion within the City of Hume extends north to Camp Road and Mahoneys Road.

==History==

The area was originally called and was part of &quot;Box Forest&quot;, named by Melbourne settler pioneer, John Pascoe Fawkner. In 1867 John Jukes bought a parcel of land in the area and named it Fawkner in honour of the pioneer settler. John Jukes grandson, David Jukes, continued to live in the area until the 1970s.

One of the original settlers in Fawkner was Michael Dowling and his family, who settled on their property at Major Road near Merri Creek in September 1902, grazing cattle to fatten for market. Miss Dowling described the area then as a harsh windy place with few trees and a few unfinished shacks.

The first school in the area was the Fawkner State School, opened 1909, on Lynch Road. The school was decommissioned in the 1990s and was subsequently purchased in 1997 by the Quang Duc Buddhist Welfare Association to build the Quang Duc Temple.

The opening of the Upfield railway line on 8 October 1889 (electrified to Fawkner on 2 December 1920); and the development and opening of the Fawkner General Cemetery in December 1906 encouraged residential development in the south of the suburb.

By 1910 there were 35 houses within walking distance of Fawkner station.

Electricity was extended to Fawkner in 1920 by the City of Coburg Electricity Supply Department. Returned soldiers started settling the suburb in the 1920s. By 1939 post office directories listed 180 buildings in Fawkner.

North Fawkner remained a dairy farm owned by the Coyne family until 1945. The period after World War II saw the most significant period of development in the suburb, with the first public housing built by the Housing Commission in 1949 and continuing up until the 1960s, with the development of the Moomba Park estate, named after the initial Labour Day Moomba Parade held in 1955. Other facilities established included the Fawkner Swimming Pool in 1964, and Fawkner Library in 1969.

The Post Office opened in 1878 as Box Forest, was renamed Fawkner in 1885 and closed in 1888. The next Fawkner office was open in 1904 and 1905. The third (known briefly as Faulkner) was open from 1909 until renamed Fawkner South in 1960. The fourth was open from 1960 until renamed Fawkner East in 1970, when the current Fawkner office opened. In addition, a Fawkner West office was open from 1962 until 1993, and the Fawkner North office on Anderson Road in the Moomba Park area opened in 1961.

The suburb was transferred from the City of Broadmeadows to the City of Moreland (now City of Merri-bek) in December 1994, when the Victorian Government forced local government mergers.

==Population==

According to Merri-bek Council&#x27;s suburb profile, Fawkner has a larger percentage of population aged over 70 years (17.7%) and aged from 5 to 11 years (8.9%), than the average for the municipality (11.8% and 7.0% respectively).

The suburb also has a lower proportion – In Fawkner, 45.2% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were Italy 9.7%, Pakistan 8.9%, as against the municipal average of 59.3%.

The most common responses for religion in Fawkner were Catholic 33.5%, Islam 31.9%, No Religion, so described 10.1%, Not stated 8.0% and Eastern Orthodox 6.0%. In Fawkner, Christianity was the largest religious group reported overall (49.1%) (this figure excludes not stated responses).

In Fawkner, 31.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian 13.8%, Urdu 12.4%, Arabic 9.2%, Greek 4.1% and Bengali 2.9%.

==Facilities==
===Shopping===
The main commercial areas in Fawkner are the strip bordering Sydney Road, which is mainly automotive-related and light-industrial, and the Bonwick Street shopping strip. There are a number of corner shops and small shopping strips dotted about the residential area. Bonwick Street offers a wide range of shops including Italian cuisine as well as cafés. There is a small shopping area on Major Road, with a local IGA grocery store and few small restaurants.

===Schools===
Within the suburb of Fawkner, there are two government primary schools: Fawkner Primary and Moomba Park Primary. Two Catholic primary schools were also built: St. Matthew&#x27;s PS and St. Mark&#x27;s PS (1934). Fawkner Secondary College began in 1956 and an Islamic college, &quot;Darul Ulum College of Victoria&quot;, was established in 1997 on the grounds of the former Fawkner North Primary school. Historically, the Fawkner Technical School was built on the site west of the Moomba Park Primary School at the same time the primary school was established. Fawkner Technical School eventually closed in 1992, and was demolished to make way for residential allotments. Bruce Smeaton, composer and musician taught at this school which started out as an exclusive boys school of high repute.

<text>Isabel Mary Sugden (21 July 19221 July 2009), known professionally as Mollie Sugden was an English actress. She was best known for being an original cast member in the British sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (1972–1985) as senior saleswoman Mrs. Slocombe and appeared reprising the character in the AYBS spin-off &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot; (1992–1993). 

She also played Nellie Harvey in &quot;Coronation Street&quot; (1965–1976), Mrs Hutchinson in &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; (1971–1996), Ida Willis in &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (1981–1986) and Nora Powers in &quot;My Husband and I&quot; (1987–1988).

==Early life==
Sugden was born on 21 July 1922 in Keighley, West Riding of Yorkshire. When she was 4 years old, she heard a woman reading a poem at a village concert making people laugh. The following Christmas, after being asked if she could &quot;do anything&quot;, Sugden read this poem and everyone fell about laughing. She later remarked that their response made her &quot;realise how wonderful it was to make people laugh&quot;. Shortly after she left school, World War II broke out, and Sugden worked in a munitions factory in Keighley making shells for the Royal Navy. After release from war work she attended the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London.

==Early career==
When Sugden graduated from the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she worked in repertory for eight years with a company that included Eric Sykes and Roy Dotrice. She also had work in radio and made her television debut in a live half-hour comedy show. Sugden&#x27;s other appearances before &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; included parts in &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Just Jimmy&quot; (with Jimmy Clitheroe), &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, &quot;The Goodies&quot;, &quot;Steptoe and Son&quot; and five episodes of &quot;Jackanory&quot; in 1968.

==Television==
Sugden&#x27;s first regular sitcom role was as Mrs Crispin in the sitcom &quot;Hugh and I&quot; (1962–1967). This was written by John T. Chapman, and when he became involved with &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; series, he suggested Sugden for the role of Sandra&#x27;s mother, Mrs Hutchinson. She appeared in the bulk of the run, from 1971 to 1979.

In 1973, she appeared in &quot;Son of the Bride&quot;.

Meanwhile, she was cast in a role which brought her international fame: Mrs Slocombe, a department store saleswoman with a socially superior attitude, a repertoire of double entendres, and a penchant for bouffant, pastel-coloured coiffures, in the long-running &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (1972–1985). In 1978, she was the lead star in &quot;Come Back Mrs. Noah&quot;, a sitcom that is regarded by some as one of the worst ever made. From 1965 to 1976, she intermittently played Nellie Harvey, the landlady of The Laughing Donkey pub, in &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. In this she often appeared opposite Annie Walker, landlady of the Rovers Return. In 1986, she had a 23-week stint on &quot;That&#x27;s Life!&quot;

Sugden also played main roles in other sitcoms, including &quot;That&#x27;s My Boy&quot; (1981–1986) and &quot;My Husband and I&quot; (1987–1988), both for ITV. In an unsuccessful revival of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; (1996), Sugden reprised her role as Mrs Hutchinson, despite being on steroids as treatment for polymyalgia.

She played opposite her husband, William Moore (1916–2000), in several series, including two episodes of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot; and again in &quot;My Husband and I&quot;, on both occasions as a married couple. They married on 29 March 1958, having met while in repertory theatre in Swansea, and had twin sons born in October 1963, Robin and Simon. She had five grandchildren.

==Radio==
Sugden appeared alongside Deryck Guyler in two series of the sitcom &quot;Home to Roost&quot; on BBC Radio 4 in 1974 and 1975. She also played Mrs Fox in the radio version of &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; from 1975 to 1976.

==Later years and death==
Seven years after the end of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, five members of the original cast – including Sugden – came together to appear in &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;, where the staff of Grace Brothers are left an old manor house in the country, which they try to run as a hotel. It ran for two series, until 1993. Other appearances at this time included &quot;Just William&quot; and &quot;Oliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. In 2003, Sugden appeared in an episode of &quot;The Bill&quot; and also appeared (as herself) in an episode of the comedy sketch show &quot;Little Britain&quot;.

In 2002, a tribute programme called &quot;Celebrating Mollie Sugden: An Are You Being Served? Special&quot;, aired on American PBS stations featuring several members of the cast of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;

Sugden died on 1 July 2009, age 86, at the Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, Surrey of unspecified heart failure and was cremated. Her final public appearance had been at the funeral of her &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; co-star Wendy Richard nearly four months earlier.

<doc id="613882" wikidata="Q1393472" url="?curid=613882" title="Maurice G. Dantec">
<text>Maurice Georges Dantec (; 14 June 1959 – 25 June 2016) was a French-born Canadian science fiction writer and musician.

== Biography ==
Dantec was born in Grenoble, France, the son of a journalist and a seamstress. He grew up primarily in Ivry-sur-Seine near Paris. While still in high school he met Jean-Bernard Pouy, future author of noir novels such as &quot;Le Poulpe&quot;, who inspired Dantec to take an interest in noir fiction. In the late 1970s, after graduating from college, Dantec put together a band called &quot;État d&#x27;urgence&quot; (&quot;State of Emergency&quot;) one of the first French punk acts. In 1977 the band changed its name to &quot;Artefact&quot;, but kept the punk ideology. Artefact is a concept-band, influenced by Suicide, Devo, Kraftwerk, Talking Heads and Public Image Limited. Dantec invented the concept of &quot;Hard-Muzak&quot; to define the sound of his band, as a mix of Industrial music and disco making the band the French equivalent of No-Wave bands from New York, and English ones from the post-punk. He pursued a career in Artefact (until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1981) while working as a copywriter in the advertising industry.

===Cyberpunk===

Dantec began writing seriously in the 1990s. His first novel, &quot;La Sirène rouge&quot; (&quot;The Red Siren&quot;), was published in 1993 as a part of the Série noire collection. The novel won the &quot;813 award&quot; for best crime novel. His second novel, &quot;Les Racines du mal&quot; (&quot;The Roots of Evil&quot;), appeared in 1995 and borders on cyberpunk fiction. The novel was successful commercially and was awarded the Prix de l&#x27;Imaginaire. His classically cyberpunk novella &quot;Là où tombent les anges&quot; (&quot;Where the Angels fall&quot;), appeared the same year, in an extra edition of Le Monde. He worked with Richard Pinhas and Norman Spinrad for the group Heldon, under the project &quot;Schizotrope&quot; for 3 albums, including a North American Tour in 1999.

Dantec and his family relocated to Québec in 1998, where he wrote his third novel &quot;Babylon Babies&quot;, which further explores the themes of decadence and apocalypse initially developed in &quot;Là où tombent les anges&quot;. &quot;Babylon Babies&quot; is influenced partly by Dantec&#x27;s interests in twentieth century French philosopher Gilles Deleuze, and shamanism.

=== Controversial writings ===

&quot;Le Théâtre des opérations, journal métaphysique et polémique&quot; (&quot;The Theatre of Operations, a Metaphysical and Polemical Journal&quot;) appeared in 2000, and is a polemical diary. Dantec followed this up in 2001 with &quot;Laboratoire de catastrophe générale&quot; (&quot;Laboratory of General Catastrophes&quot;). In both of these Dantec was influenced by French novelist and poet Léon Bloy&#x27;s diary, and especially by Bloy&#x27;s 1905 &quot;Belluaires et porchers&quot; (&quot;Gladiators and swineherds&quot;). In his works, Dantec attempts to inventory the nihilisms of the 20th century. Inspired by Léon Bloy, he draws a cruel portrait of the vanities in the French literary milieu. The diary also mixes Dantec&#x27;s poetry, criticisms on rock music, essays on literature, technology, genetics, philosophy and politics. These diaries also explore the author&#x27;s rising interest in Christianity.

===Christian-Futurism===

&quot;Villa Vortex - Liber Mundi, I&quot; in 2003 opens a trilogy of novels - though its third volume would never be written before Dantec&#x27;s death - interconnecting metaphysical research (Esotericism), technology and the post-human, in a new formal approach. With this book Dantec is possibly the first French writer to acknowledge the new era opened by the events surrounding 9/11 in a narrative.

The third volume of his journal, following &quot;Laboratoire de catastrophe générale&quot;, was published by Éditions Albin Michel in 2007.

Dantec wrote for the conservative French-language Canadian magazine &quot;Égards&quot;.

The novel &quot;Cosmos Inc&quot;, was published in August 2005 by his new publishing house Albin Michel, the first volume of another trilogy Dantec would never finish before he died.

===Film adaptations===

The first film adaptation based on the works of Dantec, &quot;The Red Siren&quot; directed by Olivier Megaton, was released in August 2002.

A film adaptation of &quot;Babylon Babies&quot;, the most cyberpunk of Dantec&#x27;s novels, has been produced under the direction of Mathieu Kassovitz as &quot;Babylon A.D.&quot;, featuring Vin Diesel in the role of Toorop.

===Dantec in English===

His novel &quot;Babylon Babies&quot; was to be translated into English by Semio-text(e) in September 2005.

In May 2006 at the Franco/Irish Literary Festival he made a bilingual conference &quot;ICH BIN EIN DUBLINER&quot;, under the theme &quot;Modern technology, its impact on the way we Live Together&quot; discussing metaphysical and political positions

In August 2006 &quot;Grande Jonction&quot;, the second part of his &quot;Christian-Futurism (Christian eschatology)&quot; trilogy was published by Albin Michel.

Del Rey Books released an English version of &quot;Cosmos Incorporated&quot; translated by Tina Kover in 2008 and an English version of &quot;Grande Jonction&quot; (&quot;Grand Junction&quot;) by the same translator in 2009.

<text>Glenroy ( ) is a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Merri-bek local government area. Glenroy recorded a population of 23,792 at the 2021 census.

Glenroy is located in the northwest of the City of Merri-bek, and is bounded by the Western Ring Road in the north, the Moonee Ponds Creek in the west, New Road, Victoria Street and Rhodes Parade in the south and West Street, Hilton Street, Box Forest Road and the Upfield railway line in the east.

Prominent features include the private Northern Golf Club, a major retail district centred on the Glenroy railway station and the Northern Memorial Park extension to the Fawkner General Cemetery.

==History==

The area was originally home to the Wurundjeri people of the Kulin Nation, before British colonisation and settlement of the Melbourne area started in 1835.

The Glenroy Estate bounded by the Moonee Ponds Creek, Camp Road, the Northern Golf Club (inclusively) and Rhodes Parade, was purchased in Sydney in 1838 by speculators Hughes and Hosking. The Camerons may have owned it as part of a Run before survey or just leased it from the speculators, and are credited with giving Glenroy its name. However, Donald Angus Kennedy, who bought the estate in the mid-1840s, bestowed the name according to his 1864 obituary in &quot;The Argus&quot;. Kennedy&#x27;s mother was Grace (née Cameron).

Initial development in the area started with a small settlement around the North East railway line at the end of the 19th century, with the Glenroy Post Office opening on 22 October 1888.

After World War II, significant development occurred when organisations such as Australian National Airways, the War Services Homes Commission and the Housing Commission of Victoria developed large areas of Glenroy. Residential development continued rapidly through the 1950s, and a Glenroy East Post Office opened in 1958 (closing in 1977).

On 15 December 1994, when the local government area of the City of Broadmeadows was abolished, suburbs south of the Western Ring Road, including Glenroy, were transferred to the City of Moreland (now City of Merri-bek).

On 25 August 2023, the 136-year-old Glenroy Post Office closed.

<text>The March on Rome () was an organized mass demonstration in October 1922 which resulted in Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party (, PNF) ascending to power in the Kingdom of Italy. In late October 1922, Fascist Party leaders planned a march on the capital. On 28 October, the fascist demonstrators and Blackshirt paramilitaries approached Rome; Prime Minister Luigi Facta wished to declare a state of siege, but this was overruled by King Victor Emmanuel III, who, fearing bloodshed, persuaded Facta to resign by threatening to abdicate. On 30 October 1922, the King appointed Mussolini as Prime Minister, thereby transferring political power to the fascists without armed conflict. On 31 October the fascist Blackshirts paraded in Rome, while Mussolini formed his coalition government.

== Background ==
In March 1919, Benito Mussolini founded the first Italian Fasces of Combat (FIC) at the beginning of the so-called Red Biennium, a two-year long social conflict between the Italian Socialist Party (PSI) and the liberal and conservative ruling class. Mussolini suffered a defeat in the election of November 1919.

During the &quot;two red years&quot;, there were numerous strikes, protests against rises in the cost of living, occupations of factories and land by industrial workers or agricultural laborers, and other types of clashes between socialists on one side and landowners and business owners on the other side. The government tried to play the role of neutral mediator, which dissatisfied both sides. Local elites felt themselves vulnerable and established an alliance with the small Fascist movement, which contained many veterans of World War I and had a reputation for violence, in the hope of using Fascist paramilitary squads to destroy socialist organizations.

Since 1919, Fascist militias, known as &quot;squadristi&quot; or &quot;Blackshirts&quot; due to their uniforms, had frequently attacked socialist politicians and militants. In August 1920, the Blackshirt militia was used to break the general strike which originated at the Alfa Romeo factory in Milan, while in November 1920, after the assassination of Giulio Giordani (a right-wing municipal councillor in Bologna), the Blackshirts were active in the suppression of the socialist movement, which included a strong anarcho-syndicalist component, especially in the Po Valley.

Local elections in 1920 were won by the socialists in many towns, cities and villages across Italy, and in response Fascist militias attacked union organizers and municipal administrators, making it difficult for local governments to function. A local deputy from the town of Budrio sent a telegram to the prime minister in October 1921 to report that the Fascists had effectively taken over, that &quot;unions and socialist clubs [were] ordered to dissolve themselves within 48 hours or face physical destruction&quot; and that the &quot;life of the town is paralysed, authorities impotent&quot;. Similar situations also occurred in other towns across Northern and Central Italy from 1920 to 1922. The police repeatedly failed to intervene against Fascist violence, and in some cases police officers openly supported the Fascists and supplied them with weapons.

In the 1921 general election the Fascists ran within the National Blocs of Giovanni Giolitti, an anti-socialist coalition of liberals, conservatives and fascists. The Fascists won 35 seats and Mussolini was elected in the Parliament for the first time.

After a few weeks, Mussolini withdrew his support for Giolitti and his Italian Liberal Party (&quot;Partito Liberale Italiano&quot;, PLI) and attempted to work out a temporary truce with the Socialists by signing the so-called &quot;Pact of Pacification&quot; in the summer of 1921. The Pact led to many protests by the radical members of the Fascist movement, led by local leaders like Roberto Farinacci, who were known as &quot;Ras&quot;. In July 1921, Giolitti attempted to dissolve the Blackshirts, but he failed; while the Pact with the Socialists was nullified during the Third Fascist Congress on 7–10 November 1921, during which Mussolini promoted a nationalist program and renamed his movement National Fascist Party (PNF), which enrolled 320,000 members by late 1921.

In August 1922, an anti-fascist general strike was organized throughout the country by the socialists. Mussolini declared that the Fascists would suppress the strike themselves if the government did not immediately intervene to stop it, which enabled him to position the Fascist Party as a defender of law and order. On 2 August, in Ancona, Fascist squads moved in from the countryside and razed all buildings occupied by socialists. This was then repeated in Genoa and other cities.

In Milan, on 3 and 4 August, there was street fighting between socialists and fascists; the fascists destroyed the printing presses of the socialist newspaper &quot;Avanti!&quot; and burned its buildings. Then, with the support of local business owners, they took over local government and expelled the elected socialist administration from the town hall.

The Italian national government in Rome did nothing to react to these developments, and its inaction prompted Mussolini to plan a march on Rome. From their new power base in Milan, the Fascists gathered the financial support of large companies who were determined to fight against &quot;strikes, bolshevism and nationalization&quot;. A delegation from the General Confederation of Italian Industry met with Mussolini two days before the March on Rome. Also a few days before the march, Mussolini consulted with the U.S. Ambassador Richard Washburn Child about whether the U.S. government would object to Fascist participation in a future Italian government and Child gave him American support. When Mussolini learned that Prime Minister Luigi Facta had given Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio the mission to organize a large demonstration on 4 November 1922 to celebrate the national victory during the war, he decided to immediately implement the March.

== The March ==

On 24 October 1922, Mussolini declared in front of 60,000 militants at a Fascist rally in Naples: &quot;Our program is simple: we want to rule Italy.&quot; On the following day, the &quot;Quadrumvirs&quot;, Emilio De Bono, Italo Balbo, Michele Bianchi and Cesare Maria de Vecchi, were appointed by Mussolini at the head of the march, while he went to Milan. He did not participate in the march, though he allowed pictures to be taken of him marching along with the Fascist marchers, and he went to Rome the next day. Generals Gustavo Fara and Sante Ceccherini assisted with the preparations of the March of 18 October. Other organizers of the march included the Marquis Dino Perrone Compagni and Ulisse Igliori.

On 26 October, the former Prime Minister Antonio Salandra warned the then Prime Minister, Luigi Facta, that Mussolini was demanding his resignation and that he was preparing to march on Rome. However, Facta did not believe Salandra and thought that Mussolini would only become a minister of his government. To meet the threat posed by the bands of fascist troops now gathering outside Rome, Luigi Facta (who had resigned but continued to hold power) ordered a state of siege for Rome. Having had previous conversations with the King about the repression of fascist violence, he was sure the King would agree. However, King Victor Emmanuel III refused to sign the military order.

On the morning of 28 October, in Milan, Mussolini received a delegation of supportive industrialists at the &quot;Il Popolo d&#x27;Italia&quot; headquarters who urgently requested him to find a compromise with Antonio Salandra. Mussolini was then proposed to rule alongside Salandra; however he refused. Following an analysis of the footage of the time with the facial recognition technique, the presence alongside Mussolini of Raoul Vittorio Palermi, Grand Master of the Gran Loggia d&#x27;Italia, was also ascertained.

On 30 October, the King handed power to Mussolini, who was supported by the military, the business class, and the right wing.
The march itself was composed of fewer than 30,000 men, but the King in part feared a civil war since the &quot;squadristi&quot; had already taken control of the Po plain and most of the country, while Fascism was no longer seen as a threat to the establishment. Mussolini was asked to form his cabinet on 29 October 1922, while some 25,000 Blackshirts were parading in Rome. Mussolini thus legally reached power, in accordance with the Statuto Albertino, the Italian Constitution. The March on Rome was not the seizure of power which Fascism later celebrated but rather the precipitating force behind a transfer of power within the framework of the constitution. This transition was made possible by the surrender of public authorities in the face of fascist intimidation. Many business and financial leaders believed it would be possible to manipulate Mussolini, whose early speeches and policies emphasized free market and laissez faire economics. This proved overly optimistic, as the Great Depression struck Italy along with the rest of the world in 1929, and Mussolini responded to it by increasing the role of the state in the economy to avoid a banking crisis. By 1934, the &quot;Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale&quot; (Institute for Industrial Reconstruction) had been created to rescue, restructure and finance banks and private companies that went bankrupt during the Great Depression, and by 1937 this Institute had become a major shareholder in Italian industry, controlling all the capital of the military steel sector, 40% of nonmilitary steel, and 30% of the electrical industry.

Back in 1922, in the aftermath of the March on Rome, Mussolini pretended to be willing to take a junior ministry in a Giolitti or Salandra cabinet, but then demanded the presidency of the Council of Ministers. Fearing a conflict with the fascists, the ruling class thus handed power to Mussolini, who went on to install the dictatorship after the 10 June 1924 assassination of Giacomo Matteotti – who had finished writing &quot;The Fascisti Exposed: A Year of Fascist Domination&quot; – executed by Amerigo Dumini, accused of being the leader of the &quot;Italian Ceka&quot;, though there is no evidence for such an organization existing.

At the end of 1923, participants in the march received authorization to wear the Commemorative Medal of the March on Rome (). In a series of royal decrees between 1926 and 1938, the Kingdom of Italy expanded eligibility for the medal until by mid-1938 all members of the Blackshirts and the Italian Armed Forces were authorized to wear it.

<text>Frederick Wordsworth Ward (c. 1835 – 25 May 1870), better known by the self-styled pseudonym of Captain Thunderbolt, was an Australian bushranger renowned for escaping from Cockatoo Island, and also for his reputation as the &quot;gentleman bushranger&quot; and his lengthy survival, being the longest-roaming bushranger in Australian history.

==Early years==
Frederick Ward was the son of convict Michael Ward, (&quot;Indefatigable&quot; 1815) and his wife Sophia, and was born in about 1835, the youngest of ten around the time his parents moved from Wilberforce to nearby Windsor. Ward entered the paid workforce at an early age, and was employed at the age of eleven by the owners of &quot;Aberbaldie Station&quot; near Walcha as a &quot;generally useful hand&quot; although he remained with them for only a short time. He worked at many stations in northern NSW over the next 10 years, including the famed horse-stud Tocal, and his horsemanship skills soon became evident. Buckbreaking became one of his most important duties. Not much is known about Michael and Sophia&#x27;s early married life, but they had ten children; William &quot;Harry&quot;, Sophia Jane, Sarah Ann, Amelia &quot;Emily&quot;, Edward B, Joshua, George E, Esther P, Selina Maria and Frederick Wordsworth (a.k.a. Thunderbolt).

In 1856 Ward&#x27;s nephew John Garbutt became the ringleader of a large horse and cattle stealing operation, and enticed other members of the extended Ward family to join him. Fred Ward helped drive some four dozen of the stolen horses from the Lambs Valley property of his brother William to Windsor where they were sold at auction. Ward and his nephews John and James Garbutt were all convicted, the Garbutts of horse-stealing and Ward of receiving stolen horses knowing them to be stolen. They each received a sentence of ten years with hard labour and were sent to the Cockatoo Island penal establishment.

Released on tickets of leave after serving four years, Ward and his nephews settled in the Mudgee district where John Garbutt met and married a wealthy widow, Elizabeth Blackman, owner of Cooyal inn and station. They employed Fred to work for them at Cooyal. There Fred met Mary Ann Bugg, who was then living with ex-convict James McNally and her children at their Cooyal farm. Mary Ann fell pregnant with Fred&#x27;s child a short time later. In breach of ticket-of-leave regulations, Ward left the Mudgee district to take Mary Ann back to her father&#x27;s farm at Monkerai near Dungog for the baby&#x27;s delivery. He returned late for his three-monthly muster and, consequently, the authorities revoked his ticket-of-leave. Ward compounded the problem by arriving in Mudgee on a &quot;stolen&quot; horse (although the owner admitted at Ward&#x27;s trial that the horse had simply gone missing from his property, that he had &quot;heard&quot; that it had been seen near Cooyal but that he had not attempted to retrieve it). Ward was sent back to Cockatoo Island to serve the remaining six years of his original sentence plus an additional three years for being in possession of a stolen horse.

==Escape from Cockatoo Island==

On 11 September 1863 Ward and a companion, Frederick Britten, slipped away from their Cockatoo Island workgang and hid for two days before swimming from the north side of the island, almost certainly to Woolwich. While most Thunderbolt books claim that Mary Ann Bugg assisted Ward in his escape, others claim she in fact remained working in Dungog throughout Ward&#x27;s second term on Cockatoo Island, and did not see him again until after his escape.

==Bushranging years==

Ward and Britten headed to the New England district where they robbed a shepherd&#x27;s hut at Gostwyck, near Uralla on 24 October. Three days later, while they were waiting to ambush the mail near the Big Rock or Split Rock (now Captain Thunderbolt&#x27;s Rock), they were spotted by troopers. In the ensuing gunfight, Ward was shot in the back of the left knee, an injury that left a critical identifying mark that helped to identify his body after his death. The pair separated a few weeks later. Ward gained the nickname &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; during the Rutherford toll-bar robbery on 21 December when the toll-bar keeper told Police that the door burst open like the sound of a thunderbolt. The newspaper (Maitland Mercury) reported this and the name stuck. Nobody knew the identity of the hold-up man at that time. 

Over the following six-and-a-half years, Ward robbed mailmen, travellers, inns, stores and stations across much of northern New South Wales - from the Hunter Valley north to Queensland and from Tamworth nearly as far west as Bourke. He was accompanied by three other men, early in 1865, when he went on a crime spree in the north-western plains, but the gang disbanded after young John Thompson was shot and captured at Millie, near Moree. Later that same year, he joined forces with another two felons but his second gang disbanded soon after one of them, Jemmy the Whisperer, shot a policeman. There is no evidence Fred Ward actually ever shot at anyone during his bushranging career. He was known to show his guns rather than brandish them or discharge them. Instead he relied on superior horseflesh to make good his getaway. He is credited with having stolen or commandeered over 40 thoroughbred racehorses in his time on the road. Thereafter Ward employed only young malleable accomplices: Thomas Mason in 1867 and William Monckton in 1868. After Monckton left him, Ward remained largely in seclusion, surfacing only a handful of times in the next eighteen months to commit robberies.

==Death and speculation==

On 25 May 1870, after allegedly robbing travellers near the Big Rock, Ward was shot and killed by Constable Alexander Binney Walker at Kentucky Creek near Uralla. His capture and death followed a difficult pursuit of several miles through rough terrain.

The bushranger had spent his last few hours in and about the Royal Oak Inn, close by Split Rock, at Church Gully. There is much to support a contention that his judgement at that time was impaired by alcohol. Publican John Blanch, served the outlaw&#x27;s last drinks at gun point. Thunderbolt ignored Eliza Blanch&#x27;s warning to get away, the traps were in sight.

Ward&#x27;s body was identified at a magisterial inquiry the next day by the gunshot wound on the back of his left knee, as well as by his height, hair and eye colouring, and moles and warts noted in the &quot;Police Gazette&quot; Reward Notice in the aftermath of his escape from Cockatoo Island. Additionally, three witnesses testified under oath that they could personally identify the body as that of Fred Ward: his former accomplice William Monckton, a fellow Mudgee employee named George William Pearson, and Senior Sergeant John George Balls who had worked on Cockatoo Island during Ward&#x27;s incarceration there.

Hundreds flocked to see the body and a large sum was raised by the local community as a gesture of appreciation for Constable Walker. Walker, along with several others, was eventually awarded a silver medal for bravery.

It has been speculated Ward did not die at Kentucky Creek on 25 May 1870, with some people believing another man died instead. In March 2010, the NSW Legislative Council went so far as to demand the release of archival records relating to Ward&#x27;s death, a motion introduced by Nationals upper house whip Rick Colless. These alternative theories surrounding Ward&#x27;s death, however, are believed to lack credibility, with the 2010 parliamentary standing order described as frivolous by some historians.

==Birth of Frederick Wordsworth Ward Jnr ==
Ward&#x27;s relationship with Mary Ann Bugg had ended late in 1867, so he was perhaps unaware that Mary Ann Bugg gave birth to his namesake in August 1868. Frederick Wordsworth Ward Jnr took the surname of his stepfather although by occupation he walked in the shoes of his birth-father. He became a groom and later a horse-trainer, and died unmarried as Frederick Wordsworth Burrows in 1937.

==Legacy==

The legend of Thunderbolt is exhibited at McCrossin&#x27;s Mill Museum in Uralla and includes the series of nine paintings by Phillip Pomroy of the events that led to Fred Ward&#x27;s death.

Thunderbolts Way is a road that extends from Gloucester to Inverell, following much of his original route between the Hunter Valley and the North West slopes and plains. &quot;Thunderbolt&#x27;s Trail&quot; is a 4WD fire trail located in the Barrington Tops State Forest which follows part of his original route.

A bullet hole in the wall of the Moonan Flat pub, made by the bushranger during a hold up, was on display near Scone, but has been painted over.

==Cultural depictions==

Thunderbolt&#x27;s story has been dramatised several times.

* Ambrose Pratt in 1905 edited William Monckton&#x27;s &quot;Three Years with Thunderbolt&quot; which he and A. S. Joseph turned into a melodrama &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, performed for the first time on 14 October 1905 by William Anderson&#x27;s company at the Theatre Royal in Sydney. The part of Thunderbolt was played by Laurence Dunbar.
* John Gavin played him in the 1910 silent film &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;.
* Cecil Holmes made &quot;Captain Thunderbolt&quot; in 1951 with locations in New England. After distribution difficulties, the premiere was in June 1955 at the Capitol Theatre, Armidale. The Sydney release was on 8 September 1955 at the Lyric, George Street. No complete print of the film is now known. The trailer was uncovered in January 2010 by the National Film &amp; Sound Archive. The film is a focus item in NFSA&#x27;s Search for Australia&#x27;s Lost Films.
*Tom Roberts 1895 painting &quot;In a corner on the Macintyre&quot; depicts Captain Thunderbolt in a shootout with police.

<text>Wendy Richard (born Wendy Emerton; 20 July 1943 – 26 February 2009) was an English actress, best known for her television roles as Miss Shirley Brahms on the BBC sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; from 1972 to 1985, and Pauline Fowler on the soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; from 1985 to 2006.

Despite being known for her Cockney accent, Richard was born in Middlesbrough. After a childhood in which her father died by suicide, Richard worked in department stores to pay her drama school fees before appearing regularly on-screen from the early 1960s. She played Joyce Harker in &quot;The Newcomers&quot; from 1967 to 1969. Richard then appeared in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films. In the television series &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, she was Private Walker&#x27;s girlfriend, before being cast as Miss Brahms in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; appearing in all 69 episodes from 1972 to 1985. She also reprised the role in the sequel series &quot;Grace and Favour&quot; in 1992 and 1993.

After &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; ended, Richard starred as Pauline Fowler in the first episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, a main role that she played in over two thousand episodes until she departed in 2006. Richard was awarded an MBE in 2000 and was later awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2007 British Soap Awards for her role in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. 

After leaving &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Richard continued to appear on-screen until her death in 2009. Richard was married four times. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996; the disease returned in 2002 and again in 2008; this time it had spread throughout her body. Richard made a documentary detailing the last few months of her life before her death in February 2009.

==Early life==
Wendy Emerton, an only child, was born on 20 July 1943 in Middlesbrough. Her parents, Henry and Beatrice Reay (née Cutter) Emerton, were publicans and ran the Corporation Hotel in the town. Emerton and Cutter married in Paddington, London in 1939. While Wendy was a baby, her family moved to Bournemouth. While living in Bournemouth, Wendy and her friend got stuck after trying to climb the cliffs and had to be rescued by the fire brigade. The family later moved to the Isle of Wight and then to London and ran the Shepherds Tavern, Shepherd Market, Mayfair where Elizabeth Taylor and Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon are said to have been customers. 

Richard enjoyed several family holidays to Jersey and Blackpool before attending the local school, St George&#x27;s Hanover Square Primary, but her education was interrupted when her family moved again, this time to the Valentine Hotel at Gants Hill, Essex. Another move, to the Streatham Park Hotel, Streatham, south London, followed a few months later. It was there, in December 1954, that Richard&#x27;s father committed suicide. Richard, then 11, found his body. Beatrice Emerton never remarried and died of liver cancer in May 1972.

She was enrolled at The Royal Masonic School for Girls in Rickmansworth after her father&#x27;s death, as Henry had been a Freemason, and help with fees was provided by the organisation. She found the school excessively strict and her art mistress called her paintings and drawings &quot;affected, rather like herself&quot;. Richard dreamed of becoming a TV continuity girl or film star from a young age and, after leaving school at 15, she enrolled at the Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts in London. She helped to pay her way through drama school by working in the fashion department at the Fortnum and Mason department store. She briefly worked at Fenwicks but was sacked after two days for telling a customer a coat did not suit her after the customer asked her for her opinion. It was at that time that she decided to change her surname to Richard, because &quot;it was short and neat&quot;. 

While at the Italia Conti, Richard became a model and picked up several modelling jobs for magazines such as &quot;Woman&#x27;s Own&quot;. Still at drama school, she was run over by a car when crossing the road outside the Italia Conti school. Her injuries were so severe that her friend phoned Richard&#x27;s mother from the hospital thinking she was dead; she had to have thirty-three stitches in her head. She made her television debut in November 1961 when she appeared alongside Mandy Rice-Davies with Sammy Davis Jr. in the ATV variety show &quot;Saturday Spectacular&quot;.

==Career==
Upon leaving drama school, Richard wrote to theatrical agents hoping to be taken on for work, including Robert Stigwood. In 1962, her distinctive cockney vocals helped get her to No. 1 on the UK singles chart with the single &quot;Come Outside&quot; by Mike Sarne who was managed by Stigwood. This was followed by many promotional appearances which exposed her to television audiences.

Drawing on from the success of &quot;Come Outside&quot;, Richard was taken on by the Lom Artists agency, and her first role with her new agent was in the sitcom &quot;Bulldog Breed&quot; with Amanda Barrie for Granada Television before starring as Susan Sullivan, a receptionist, in five episodes of &quot;Harpers West One&quot;, an ATV television drama series about a fictional department store. Richard then appeared in series such as &quot;Danger Man&quot;, &quot;No Hiding Place&quot;, &quot;Hugh and I&quot; and &quot;The Contact&quot; with John Hurt. In 1965, she appeared in an episode of the original &quot;Likely Lads&quot; series as a household cleaner saleswoman called Lynn. Richard also appears in a scene cut from the released version of The Beatles movie &quot;Help!&quot; (1965). In addition, she had a small role as a nurse in &quot;Doctor in Clover&quot; (1966).

Richard first became familiar to television audiences in 1967 playing teenage supermarket till girl Joyce Harker, a regular character, in &quot;The Newcomers&quot;, until the show&#x27;s end in 1969. After &quot;The Newcomers&quot; ended, Richard had a recurring role as Edith Parish, Private Walker&#x27;s usherette girlfriend in &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; from 1970 to 1973, and had roles in several television series including &quot;Up Pompeii!&quot;, &quot;Please Sir!&quot; and &quot;On the Buses&quot; before appearing in &quot;Both Ends Meet&quot;, a sitcom about a sausage factory with Dora Bryan. 

From 1972 to 1985, Richard was a regular cast member of the sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; as Shirley Brahms, an attractive, young shop assistant with a strong Cockney accent. Set in the ladies and gentleman&#x27;s clothing department in the fictional department store Grace Brothers with Miss Brahms being under the eye of Mrs Slocombe and being the subject of menswear junior Mr Lucas&#x27;s advances. Richard later reprised her role in the &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; sequel &quot;Grace &amp; Favour&quot;, which aired from 1992 to 1993. 

Richard appeared in two &quot;Carry On&quot; films, playing small roles in &quot;Carry On Matron&quot; (1972) and &quot;Carry On Girls&quot; (1973) (both films also featured her future &quot;EastEnders&quot; colleague Barbara Windsor). Richard&#x27;s other film roles around this time included &quot;No Blade of Grass&quot; (1970), &quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971) starring Albert Finney, and the film versions of &quot;On The Buses&quot; (1971), &quot;Bless This House&quot; (1972), and &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; (1977). While appearing in &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, she had parts in &quot;The Fenn Street Gang&quot;, &quot;Z Cars&quot; and &quot;Bowler&quot; as well as having regular roles in &quot;Hogg&#x27;s Back&quot; and &quot;Not On Your Nellie&quot;.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===
The same year that &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; ended, Richard began appearing as the matriarch Pauline Fowler in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders,&quot; a role she played from the first episode in 1985. The character has been described as a &quot;legend&quot; and a television icon, but was also voted the 35th &quot;most annoying person of 2006&quot; (being the only fictional character to appear on the list). Pauline has been the subject of television documentaries, behind-the-scenes books, tie-in novels, and comedy sketch shows. On 10 July 2006, the BBC announced that Richard had decided to leave the series after more than 20 years. Until the onscreen death of her character at Christmas 2006, she was one of only two original cast members of that programme to appear continuously from the first episode in 1985, along with Adam Woodyatt, who played her on-screen nephew Ian Beale.

In 2007, Richard was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at The British Soap Awards for her role in &quot;EastEnders.&quot;

===Later career===
Richard appeared regularly on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;Just a Minute&quot; from 1988 to 1994. She returned for the programme&#x27;s television iteration in 1999 and for further appearances on radio in 2002 and 2003. 

In 2000, Richard was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. 

In late 2006, Richard was seen as a guest presenter on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;City Hospital&quot; series and on 31 March 2007, she presented the documentary &quot;A Tribute to John Inman,&quot; for BBC2.

In April 2007, Richard announced that she would be appearing in a new role for the first time since leaving &quot;EastEnders,&quot; in a new sitcom penned by David Croft called &quot;Here Comes The Queen&quot;. The project came about after she personally asked Croft to write something for her. Richard had commented: &quot;The part is like an older version of Miss Brahms&quot;. A pilot episode was made, which was considered to be poor, and it was never transmitted. 

In September 2007, it was announced that Richard would appear in the second series of ITV1&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Benidorm&quot; playing a &quot;loud-mouthed, rude&quot; character who used a wheelchair; her episode aired in April 2008. 

In January 2008, adverts for The Post Office featuring Richard (as a human cannonball) began to be shown. 

In February 2008, she landed the role of Mrs. Crump in the &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Marple&quot; episode &quot;A Pocket Full of Rye&quot; starring Julia McKenzie. This was her final role, airing after her death in 2009.

==Personal life==
Richard was married four times. Her first marriage was to a music publisher, Len Blach, in 1972, which lasted just five months. For six years, she lived with an advertising director, Will Thorpe; she married Thorpe in 1980, leaving him after 18 months of marriage. Her third marriage, to Paul Glorney, a carpet fitter, took place in Westminster, London, in 1990. That marriage ended in divorce four years later. Richard later lived with John Burns, a painter and decorator 20 years her junior, in the Marylebone area of London. They lived together from 1996 and married on 10 October 2008 at a hotel in Mayfair. They remained together until her death four months later. She had no children.

Richard was a supporter of the Conservative Party. She was particularly supportive of Margaret Thatcher and her policies. During her early years on &quot;EastEnders&quot;, scriptwriters gave Richard a script in which Pauline Fowler launched into a tirade against Thatcher, but Richard refused to perform it.

===Illness===
In 1996, Richard was diagnosed with breast cancer. She had surgery and was given the all-clear, but experienced a recurrence of the disease in 2002. Her cancer went into remission after years of treatment and she was given a clean bill of health in 2005. Articles about her departure from &quot;EastEnders&quot; suggested that her health problems did not play any role in her decision, but was because her character in the soap remarried, to Richard&#x27;s displeasure. Richard later said she left because of stress and that she had been stress-free since leaving the show. She kept in touch with co-stars Bill Treacher, Natalie Cassidy, Todd Carty, and James Alexandrou. 

In January 2008, cancer cells were found in her left armpit, and it was reported in the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; on 5 October 2008 that she had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Further investigation showed that it had metastasised to her left kidney and bones, including her spine and left ribs. It was reported the actress had planned her funeral and written her will. She made a half-hour programme, &quot;Wendy Richard: To Tell You the Truth&quot;, documenting the last three months of her life, which was broadcast on BBC One on 19 March 2009.

===Death===

Richard&#x27;s agent, Kevin Francis, reported she had died on 26 February 2009 of breast cancer, aged 65, at a clinic in Harley Street, London. Her husband, John Burns, was at her bedside. Francis said: &quot;She was incredibly brave and retained her sense of humour right to the end.&quot; On the day of her death, that evening&#x27;s episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot; and a memorial programme, both dedicated to Richard, were broadcast on BBC One. Actor Bill Treacher, Richard&#x27;s on-screen husband Arthur Fowler in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, said the actress was a &quot;true professional.&quot; 

Richard&#x27;s funeral, on 9 March 2009 at St Marylebone Parish Church, was attended by figures from the media industry, along with many fans. Her body was later cremated at a private service at Golders Green Crematorium. In July 2009, David Croft, the creator of &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, unveiled a commemorative plaque at The Shepherds Tavern (since renamed to The Chesterfield Arms) in Shepherd Street in London&#x27;s West End, which Richard&#x27;s parents had run. A number of entertainers were there to pay their respects on the occasion.

<text>The North Side (sometimes written as Northside) is the region of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, located to the north of the Allegheny River and the Ohio River.

The North Side is made up of the following neighborhoods: Allegheny Center, Allegheny West, Brighton Heights, California-Kirkbride, Central Northside, Chateau, East Allegheny, Fineview, Manchester, Marshall-Shadeland, North Shore, Northview Heights, Perry North, Perry South, Spring Garden, Spring Hill–City View, Summer Hill, and Troy Hill.

The North Side has seven hills: Observatory Hill, Monument Hill, Troy Hill, Spring Hill, Seminary Hill, Fineview, and Mount Troy.

==History and famous residents==
In 1828, the borough of Allegheny, Pennsylvania, was incorporated where the North Side now stands. It had a population of 1,000. In 1880, Allegheny was incorporated as a city. The City of Allegheny was annexed by Pittsburgh in 1907, and became known as the North Side.

Historians claim that the Felix Brunot mansion on Stockton Avenue (Allegheny Center) was once a station on the Underground Railroad, where fugitive slaves from the South stopped for food and shelter. The Allegheny regional branch of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, located at 5 Allegheny Square (Allegheny Center), was the first tax-supported library in the United States. It is now closed to the public following a lightning strike on April 6, 2007. A new library opened nearby at 1230 Federal Street. Charles Taze Russell organized what are now known as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses at a house in the old city of Allegheny.

Mary Cassatt was born on Rebecca Street in 1844. Today, Rebecca Street has become Reedsdale Street (in the North Shore neighborhood). If the house had not been torn down for Highway Route 65, it would be facing Heinz Field, the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

George Washington Gale Ferris Jr. lived at 1318 Arch Street (Central Northside) when he created the original Ferris Wheel for the 1893 Chicago World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in an attempt to create something as impressive as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France.

The first World Series was played at Exposition Park by the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Boston Americans (now known as the Boston Red Sox) in 1903.

Gus &amp; Yia-Yia&#x27;s Iceball Stand, selling fresh popcorn, peanuts, and old-fashioned iceballs (similar to snow cones) hand-scraped from a block of ice, has been in West Park since 1934. The &quot;orange concession stand with a brightly colored umbrella&quot; is something of an unofficial Pittsburgh landmark during the summer months.

A 20-acre Allis-Chalmers transformer factory provided as many as 2,600 jobs to the area from 1897 until closing in the Summer of 1975.

<doc id="613896" wikidata="Q966229" url="?curid=613896" title="Myxedema">
<text>Myxedema () is a term used synonymously with severe hypothyroidism. However, the term is also used to describe a dermatological change that can occur in hypothyroidism and (rare) paradoxical cases of hyperthyroidism. In this latter sense, myxedema refers to deposition of mucopolysaccharides in the dermis, which results in swelling of the affected area. One manifestation of myxedema occurring in the lower limb is pretibial myxedema, a hallmark of Graves disease, an autoimmune form of hyperthyroidism. Myxedema can also occur in Hashimoto thyroiditis and other long-standing forms of hypothyroidism.

==Signs and symptoms==
Myxedema&#x27;s characteristic physical sign is non-pitting edema, in contrast to pitting edema.

Myxedema can also occur in the lower leg (pretibial myxedema) and behind the eyes (exophthalmos).

Severe cases, requiring hospitalization can exhibit signs of hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hypotension, respiratory depression, and coma.

==Causes==
Myxedema is known to occur in various forms of hypothyroidism, as well as hyperthyroidism, including Graves disease. One of the hallmarks of Grave&#x27;s disease is pretibial myxedema, myxedema of the lower limb.

Myxedema is more common in women than in men.

Myxedema can occur in:
* &quot;Hyperthyroidism&quot;, associated with pretibial myxedema and exophthalmos. Pretibial myxedema can occur in 1–4% of patients with Graves&#x27; disease, a cause of hyperthyroidism.
* &quot;Hypothyroidism&quot;, including Hashimoto&#x27;s thyroiditis.

==Pathophysiology==
Myxedema describes a specific form of cutaneous and dermal edema secondary to increased deposition of connective tissue components. The connective fibres are separated by an increased amount of protein and mucopolysaccharides. These can include glycosaminoglycans, such as hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulfate and other mucopolysaccharides. This protein-mucopolysaccharide complex binds water, producing non-pitting boggy edema, in particular around eyes, hands, feet and in the supraclavicular fossae. Myxoedema is responsible for the thickening of the tongue and the laryngeal and pharyngeal mucous membranes, which results in thick slurred speech and hoarseness, both of which are seen commonly in hypothyroidism.

The increased deposition of glycosaminoglycan is not fully understood, however, two mechanisms predominate:
* Fibroblast stimulation. It is thought that fibroblast stimulation by the thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor increases the deposition of glycosaminoglycan, which results in an osmotic edema and fluid retention. It is thought that many cells responsible for forming connective tissue react to increases in TSH levels.
* Lymphocyte stimulation. In Graves&#x27; thyroid disease, lymphocytes react against the TSH receptor by inappropriately producing thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (IgG; type II hypersensitivity). Lymphocytes react not only against thyroid receptors, but also any tissue with cells expressing the receptor. This can lead to tissue damage and scar tissue formation, explaining the deposition of glycosaminoglycans.

==Diagnosis==
It is often possible to diagnose myxedema on clinical grounds alone. Characteristic symptoms are weakness, cold intolerance, mental and physical slowness, dry skin, typical facies, and hoarse voice. Results of the total serum thyroxine and free thyroxine index tests usually will confirm the diagnosis.

==Management==
Primary treatment is prompted by the administration of adequate doses of either the thyroid hormone L-thyroxine given intravenously or by giving liothyronine via a nasogastric tube. It is essential to identify and treat the condition precipitating the coma.

Myxedema coma is rare but often fatal. It occurs most often in elderly women and may be mistaken for one of the chronic debilitating diseases common to this age group.

Though the exact cause of myxedema is still unclear, a wealth of research has demonstrated the importance of iodine. In an important study the researchers showed that in the myxedematous type of cretinism treatment with iodine normalizes thyroid function provided that the treatment is begun early in the postnatal period. If not, the prognosis remains dismal.

==History==
Myxedema was first treated successfully in 1891 when George Redmayne Murray diagnosed a 46-year-old woman with the disease. He prescribed an extract from sheep thyroid. The patient improved significantly within a few weeks and lived another 28 years while taking the sheep thyroid extract.

==Etymology==
The word myxedema originates from , meaning &quot;mucus&quot; or &quot;slimy substance&quot;, and for &quot;swelling&quot;.

<text>Uralla is a town on the Northern Tablelands, New South Wales, Australia. It is located at the intersection of the New England Highway and Thunderbolts Way, north of Sydney and about south-west of the city of Armidale. At the , the township of Uralla had a population of 2,388. According to the , the population of Uralla had increased to 2,728.

At more than above sea level, Uralla&#x27;s high altitude makes for cool to cold winters and mild summers.

Uralla has maintained significant heritage characteristics, with more than 50 buildings and sites of heritage significance.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the community bought and restored McCrossins Mill, and the complex now operates as a museum, gallery and function centre, run by volunteers. It is also the starting point for a heritage walk.

==History==
Before European colonisation, the area including Uralla had been occupied for 35,000 years by the indigenous Anēwan people. The name &quot;Uralla&quot; was adopted from the language of the Anēwan by the squatters who first occupied the area. It refers to a ceremonial meeting place or camp.

During the early 1960s, children at the Uralla Public School were taught that the name Uralla was an indigenous word which meant &quot;chain of waterholes&quot;, which is an accurate description of the waterway which runs through the town. However, it is not known whether that has been verified by Indigenous linguistic studies.

Samuel McCrossin, an Irishman, his wife, and seven children, first arrived in the Uralla area in 1839 and camped on the creek. They went back to Morpeth but returned to Uralla in 1841, to finally settle there. In the 1830s and 40s, the land began to be occupied by squatters who had moved north, beyond the limit of location set by the government. The squatters were attracted by the prime sheep grazing land of the New England Tableland. Some of the squatting runs were Kentucky, Gostwyck, Balala, Yarrowyck, Mihi Creek, Terrible Vale and Salisbury Court. Some of the station buildings, including Balala and the Gostwyck Chapel, have now been placed on the Register of the National Estate. Some of the land occupied by the squatters was made available to farmers after the passing of the Robertson Land Acts in 1861.

Uralla achieved town status in 1855, spurred by a gold rush in the Rocky River area three years earlier, swelling the town&#x27;s population to over 5,000. In 1856, another, more considerable gold rush took place, but did not lead to any lasting development. By 1859, Uralla had three hotels, stores, a post office, a flour mill and a school. The Uralla Municipality was incorporated in 1882. In 1948, it became the administrative centre of the Uralla Shire after the municipality was merged with the former Gostwyck Shire. More gold was discovered and mined at Melrose in the Enmore area in about 1887. This discovery led to the erection of the Melrose public school and village, which was about 32 km east of Uralla. In 1927 this area was subdivided for soldier settlement, and ballots were held to determine the new settlers. In about 1889, gold was discovered at Groses Creek, which is 6 km south-west of Enmore, near the Mihi Falls on the eastern side of Uralla.

The infamous bushranger Captain Thunderbolt (Frederick Ward) is buried in the old Uralla Cemetery (John Street). There are many references to Thunderbolt throughout the town, and the locals are quite fond of the legend. In addition to an initially controversial statue in the main street, Uralla is host to a pub, motel, rock (from where Thunderbolt ambushed passing travellers) and roads, all bearing his name. On 25 May 1870, Thunderbolt was shot and killed near Uralla by Constable Alexander Walker during a highway robbery. However, a few Uralla locals claimed that it was his uncle, William (Harry) Ward - posing as Thunderbolt, who was killed at this time and not Fred Ward. The legend of Thunderbolt is exhibited at McCrossin&#x27;s Mill Museum in Uralla and includes the series of 9 paintings by Phillip Pomroy of the events that led to Fred Ward&#x27;s death.

During 2008 Uralla recorded the state&#x27;s highest rise in property values at 35 per cent over the last 12 months, according to a report from Australian Property Monitors.

==Climate==
Uralla has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), with warm, stormy summers and cool to cold winters with a few snowfalls and many frosts. 

==Population==
According to the 2016 census, the population of Uralla was 2,421:
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 11.7% of the population. 
* 86.7% of people were born in Australia and 93.3% of people spoke only English at home.
* The most common responses for religion were Anglican 28.8%, No Religion 22.8% and Catholic 22.3%.

== Heritage listings ==
Uralla has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* 6 East Street: New England Brass and Iron Lace Foundry
* Main Northern railway: Uralla railway station
* Salisbury Street: McCrossins Mill
* Uralla Square: Captain Thunderbolt&#x27;s Grave
* New England Highway: Blanch&#x27;s Royal Oak Inn
* New England Highway: Captain Thunderbolt&#x27;s Rock

==Industries==

Three foundries account for a large amount of employment in the town, as do other metal manufacturing businesses. As Uralla is situated about halfway between Sydney and Brisbane, tourism contributes significantly to its economy, with a thriving village atmosphere and 20 National Parks within a two-hour drive. Due to Uralla&#x27;s proximity to Armidale, larger shopping chains have avoided the small town and independent retailers remain. Examples include an antiquarian book store, numerous galleries, antique stores and cafes.

It is still possible to pan for gold in the rivers around the town, including the Rocky River. Today, the area is used for raising Merino sheep and is renowned for its super-fine and ultra-fine wool for use in the fashion industry. A number of vineyards have also been established and produce a variety of cool-climate wines. It is also a good area for growing apples and other fruit which require colder weather.

Lockheed Martin has erected an Australian satellite tracking station at Uralla.

Uralla is also host to a thriving community of artists and potters, stimulated by proximity to the University of New England in nearby Armidale.

The found that the most common industries of all the employed people in the locality were:
* School Education - 6.7%
* Sheep, Beef Cattle and Grain Farming - 5.8%
* Local Government Administration - 5.0%
* Tertiary Education - 4.6%
* Cafes, Restaurants and Takeaway Food Services - 2.9%.

There are a number of environmental problems in the area, mainly caused by poor land management. Soil erosion, due to extensive logging and intensive farm practices is a major issue. Local government and community environmental bodies are now working to halt the problem.

==Uralla Railway Station==

Uralla station is served by the daily NSW TrainLink Xplorer service between Armidale and Sydney. The station is 16 minutes by train, from Armidale.

<doc id="613898" wikidata="Q6155885" url="?curid=613898" title="January Club">
<text>The January Club was a discussion group founded in 1934 by Oswald Mosley to attract Establishment support for the movement known as the British Union of Fascists. 

The Club was under the effective control of Robert Forgan, working on behalf of the BUF. The founders as identified by MI5 were Forgan, Donald Makrill, Francis Yeats-Brown and Henry William &#x27;Billy&#x27; Luttman-Johnson. Members of the January Club included Wing-Commander Sir Louis Greig; Lord Erskine, a Conservative and Unionist MP and assistant Government whip; Lord William Montagu-Douglas-Scott, brother of the 8th Duke of Buccleuch and Conservative and Unionist MP; and (according to Nigel H. Jones&#x27; biography of Mosley) Lord and Lady Russell of Liverpool.

Sir Charles Petrie, who participated in the club&#x27;s early stages, discusses the club at some length (and offers criticisms of Mosley&#x27;s methods) in his 1972 memoir, &quot;A Historian Looks at his World&quot;. The poet and editor John Collings Squire was another author initially involved with the club but &quot;found the atmosphere uncongenial before long&quot;. Petrie&#x27;s memoir also mentions Yeats-Brown as soon complaining: &quot;The January Club will probably collapse; anyway I&#x27;m not going to the next meeting. Mosley is not human enough.&quot;

<text>Bingara (Aboriginal for &#x27;creek&#x27;) is a small town on the Gwydir River in Murchison County in the New England region of New South Wales, Australia. Bingara is currently the administrative centre for the Gwydir Shire that was created in 2003. The Gwydir River being a main highlight of the town is a main catchment of the Murray-Darling System.

==Location==
Bingara is located 141 km north of Tamworth, 54 km west of Inverell, 449 km north of Sydney and 358 km south west of Brisbane. Bingara is located very close to Myall Creek, the site of the massacre of 27 to 30 Indigenous Australians.

==History==
Before British colonisation the Bingara region was within the country of the Wirraayaraay people.

In 1827, British explorer Allan Cunningham crossed the Gwydir River near Bingara. At the time he mistook the river to be the Peel River, but realised his mistake on his return journey.

British colonisation at Bingara began in 1836 with the arrival of the pastoralist squatter Thomas Simpson Hall. Hall established the Bingara leasehold as a sheep and cattle station. The local Aborigines initially resisted Hall&#x27;s incursion and both Aboriginal and Europeans were killed in the resulting skirmishes. Hall himself received a spear wound to his head during one of these battles. A detachment of New South Wales Mounted Police under Sergeant John Temple were dispatched to the area and, accompanied by Hall&#x27;s armed stockmen, exacted a &quot;terrible retribution upon the blacks&quot;. The creek running through Bingara is named Hall&#x27;s Creek after Thomas Simpson Hall.

The discovery of gold in 1852 brought prospectors to the area. In the 1880s, copper and diamonds were discovered also, causing a rapid development of the town. Bingara is one of the few places in Australia where diamonds have been found. In fact, Bingara was the largest producer of diamonds in Australia at that time. Bingara changed the spelling of its name from &quot;Bingera&quot; to &quot;Bingara&quot; in 1890. The first &quot;Bingera&quot; Post Office opened on 1 January 1853 and was renamed &quot;Upper Bingera&quot; in 1862 and closed in 1868. The second &quot;Bingera&quot; office opened in 1862 and was renamed &quot;Bingara&quot; in 1890.

<doc id="613910" wikidata="Q4392339" url="?curid=613910" title="Felony murder rule">
<text>The rule of felony murder is a legal doctrine in some common law jurisdictions that broadens the crime of murder: when someone is killed (regardless of intent to kill) in the commission of a dangerous or enumerated crime (called a felony in some jurisdictions), the offender, and also the offender&#x27;s accomplices or co-conspirators, may be found guilty of murder.

The concept of felony murder originates in the rule of transferred intent. In its original form, the malicious intent inherent in the commission of any crime, however trivial, was considered to apply to any consequences of that crime regardless of intent.

==History==
While there is debate about the original scope of the rule, modern interpretations typically require that the offence be an inherently dangerous one, or one committed in an obviously dangerous manner. For this reason, the felony murder rule is often justified by its supporters as a means of deterring dangerous felonies.

According to some commentators, the common law rule dates to the twelfth century and took its modern form in the eighteenth century. The modern conception of the felony murder rule arose in 1716, with William Hawkins&#x27; &quot;Treatise of Pleas of the Crown&quot;, during his work on English criminal law. Hawkins reasoned that malice was implicit in a crime that &quot;necessarily tends to raise Tumults and Quarrels, and consequently cannot but be attended with the danger of personal hurt.&quot; Thus, &quot;this rule should extend to killings in the course of felonies à fortiori.&quot;

==Elements==
In most jurisdictions, to qualify as an underlying offense for a felony murder charge, the underlying offense must present a foreseeable danger to life, and the link between the offense and the death must not be too remote. For example, if the recipient of a forged check has a fatal allergic reaction to the ink, most courts will not hold the forger guilty of murder, as the cause of death is too remote from the criminal act.

There are two schools of thought concerning whose actions can cause the defendant to be guilty of felony murder. Jurisdictions that hold to the &quot;agency theory&quot; admit only deaths caused by the agents of the crime. Jurisdictions that use the &quot;proximate cause theory&quot; include any death, even if caused by a bystander or the police, provided that it meets one of several proximate cause tests to determine if the chain of events between the offence and the death was short enough to have legally caused the death.

The merger doctrine excludes from the offenses that qualify as underlying offenses any felony that is presupposed by a murder charge. For example, nearly all murders involve some type of assault, but so do many cases of manslaughter. To count any death that occurred during the course of an assault as felony murder would obliterate a distinction that is carefully set by the legislature. However, merger may not apply when an assault against one person results in the death of a different person.

Felony murder is typically the same grade of murder as premeditated murder and carries the same sentence as is used for premeditated murder in the jurisdiction in question.

==By country==
The felony murder rule has been abolished in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland. In Canada, it has been held to be unconstitutional, as breaching the principles of fundamental justice. In some jurisdictions, the common law felony murder (called constructive murder) rule has been abolished, but has been replaced by a similar statutory provision (such as in Victoria, Australia with the Crimes Act 1958). Similarly, in New South Wales, common law has been overridden and the question needs only be dealt with through statutory construction and application.

=== Australia ===
In New South Wales, § 18(1)(a) of the &quot;Crimes Act 1900&quot; provides the statutory definition of &#x27;constructive murder&#x27;. The act or omission causing death must be &quot;done in an attempt to commit or during or immediately after the commission, by the accused, or some accomplice with him or her, of a crime punishable by imprisonment for life or for 25 years&quot;. The rationale is to discourage acts of felony which are dangerous to human life.

&quot;Ryan v R&quot; clarifies the elements of constructive murder. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt: (1) a base offence with 25 years&#x27; imprisonment or more; and that (2) the act causing death occurred in attempt, during, or immediately after this base offence. This means that the prosecution must prove both the &quot;actus reus&quot; and &quot;mens rea&quot; of this base offence. &quot;R v Munro&quot; confirmed that the &quot;mens rea&quot; of the act causing death is not required to prove constructive murder. For example, the accused may commit an act causing death in the course of robbery or armed robbery without any intention to kill, to inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life.

===Canada===

As Canadian criminal law aims to maintain proportionality between the stigma and punishment attached to a conviction and the moral blameworthiness of an offender, in &quot;R v Martineau&quot; the Supreme Court of Canada held that it is a principle of fundamental justice under sections 7 and 11(d) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that a conviction for murder requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt of a &quot;subjective foresight of death&quot;. In so doing, the court declared sections 230 and 229(c) of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; to be unconstitutional.

S. 230 provided that a conviction for murder would lie for any killing that was &quot;objectively foreseeable as a result of the abominable nature of the predicate crimes ... &quot;inter alia&quot; ... coupled with intentional infliction of bodily harm&quot;. This largely equated with a Canadian form of felony murder, though it is technically closer to constructive murder in other jurisdictions. Similarly, according to s. 229(c) it was sufficient for a person to do anything that he &quot;&quot;ought to know&quot; is likely to cause death&quot;.

Nevertheless, s. 229(c), as far as it provides for a form of constructive murder in situations where &quot;an accused for an unlawful object did anything &quot;knowing&quot; that it was likely [on an objective standard] to cause someone&#x27;s death&quot; is still operative, as confirmed in a 1999 appellate court decision.

Bill C-39 was introduced in 2017 in order to repeal s. 230 and modify s. 229(c).

Like other common law jurisdictions, Canada&#x27;s Criminal Code specifically enumerates offences to account for instances where (a) person(s) is/are unintentionally killed during the commission of a crime (for example, criminal negligence causing death and impaired driving causing death). In cases where multiple deaths are caused by the same criminal act, the accused will face a separate charge for each death caused. While such charges are not considered to be murder under Canadian law, the maximum penalty for such offences is still life imprisonment – although unlike murder this is not a mandatory sentence and is only very rarely imposed. The main difference between a sentence of life imprisonment for murder and a sentence of life imprisonment for an offence such as criminal negligence causing death is that in the latter case, the offender is eligible for parole after serving seven years.

===Ireland===
The rule was abolished in the Republic of Ireland by section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1964 which codified the &quot;mens rea&quot; for murder as intention to kill or seriously injure another person.

===United Kingdom===
The felony murder rule was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1957. 

====England and Wales, Northern Ireland====
The rule was abolished in England and Wales by section 1 of the Homicide Act 1957, and in Northern Ireland by section 8 of the Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1966; but its effect is preserved by the application of the common law principle of joint enterprise. In England and Wales, the definition of murder requires only an intent to cause grievous bodily harm to the victim, rather than specific intent to kill; the effect is the same as that of the felony murder rule applied to crimes of personal violence, though not to all felonies.

In 2006, as part of a broad review of the law on murder, the Law Commission considered and rejected the suggestion of reinstating the felony murder rule in English law.

====Scotland====
There is no equivalent to the felony murder rule in Scots law, which has also never had a specific concept of &quot;felonies&quot; in the previous style of English law. However, the Scots equivalent of joint enterprise, known as &quot;art and part&quot;, also has a similar effect.

===United States===

, 46 states in the United States had a felony murder rule, under which felony murder is generally first-degree murder. In 24 of those states, it is a capital offense. When the government seeks to impose the death penalty on someone convicted of felony murder, the Eighth Amendment has been interpreted so as to impose additional limitations on the state power. The death penalty may not be imposed if the defendant is merely a minor participant and did not actually kill or intend to kill. However, the death penalty may be imposed if the defendant is a major participant in the underlying felony and exhibits extreme indifference to human life.

Most states recognize the merger doctrine, which holds that a criminal assault cannot serve as the predicate felony for the felony murder rule.

To avoid the need for reliance upon common law interpretations of what felony conduct merges with murder, and what offenses do and do not qualify for felony murder, many U.S. jurisdictions explicitly list what offenses qualify in a felony murder statute. Federal law specifies additional crimes, including terrorism, kidnapping, and carjacking.

The American Law Institute&#x27;s Model Penal Code does not include the felony murder rule, but allows the commission of a felony to raise a presumption of extreme indifference to the value of human life. The felony murder rule is effectively used as a rule of evidence. The Model Penal Code lists robbery, rape or forcible deviant sexual intercourse, arson, burglary, and felonious escape as predicate felonies upon which a charge of felony murder can be maintained.

===== Colorado =====
Lisl Auman was convicted under the felony murder rule in connection with a felony burglary conviction in 1998 and initially received a life sentence. Her conviction was later reversed, and she pleaded (pled) guilty to lesser charges in 2016.

===== Kentucky =====
In the state of Kentucky, the common law felony murder rule has been completely abolished.

===== KRS § 507.020 =====
The Kentucky Legislature abolished the felony murder rule with the enactment of Kentucky Revised Statutes § 507.020. Recognizing that an automatic application of the rule could result in conviction of murder without a culpable mindset, the Kentucky Legislature instead allowed the circumstances of a case, like the commission of a felony, to be considered separately. The facts each case would be used to show the mental state of the defendant instead of using an automatic rule.

=====&quot;Minnesota v. Derek Michael Chauvin&quot;=====

The police officer who murdered George Floyd was tried and convicted under the felony murder rule.

==Criticism==
Some commentators regard the rule of transferred intent as a legal fiction whereby the law pretends that the person who intended one wrongful act also intends all the consequences of that act, however unforeseen. Others regard it as an example of strict liability, whereby a person who chooses to commit a crime is considered absolutely responsible for all possible consequences of that action. Lord Mustill regarded the historical rule as a convergence of those views.

Some critics of the felony murder rule argue that the rule is unjust because it does not require intent to kill. In the United States, for example, twenty-year-old Florida resident Ryan Holle was convicted of first-degree murder for lending his car to a friend after his friend told him that he intended to go beat an eighteen-year-old woman. The friend took the car and beat the girl to death.

Negotiating away the felony murder charge as part of a plea bargain can result in sentences which are much longer than would be the case if all other charges were considered together, but isolated from the felony murder charge. A review of criminal convictions in Minnesota found that most white defendants convicted of felony murder were originally charged with more serious offenses, while for most Black defendants convicted of felony murder it was the most serious offense initially charged. Almost half of defendants charged with felony murder in Minnesota are under the age of 25. The average sentence is 24 years. 

In the context of police shootings, increasing attention has been focused on the issue of felony murder charges covering up the use of excessive force or careless use of extreme force by the police. This occurs because the death is interpreted as a consequence of a criminal act. As a result, liability for the death is transferred in its entirety away from the shooting officer, regardless of whether the victim of a police shooting was armed or whether the officer in question had a record of previous excessive force. In such cases, there may be no incentive for a police officer or a police department to alter their standard procedures.

In favor of the rule, it can be argued that the rule affirms the principle of the sanctity of human life by imposing harsher penalties for crimes that destroy human life.

<doc id="613911" wikidata="Q7688858" url="?curid=613911" title="1993 Tauranga by-election">
<text>The Tauranga by-election was a by-election in the New Zealand electorate of Tauranga, a city in New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It took place on 17 April 1993, and was precipitated by the resignation from parliament of sitting MP Winston Peters. Peters, who had been increasingly at odds with his National Party colleagues, had resigned both from his party and from Parliament. He contested the seat as an independent.

==Background==
None of the major parties contested this election, claiming the upcoming general election was close enough to make the by-election nothing but a publicity stunt. The National Party did not propose a candidate to replace Peters. As expected, Peters won a massive majority, receiving just over ninety percent of the vote. While Peters&#x27; grip on Tauranga was so secure at the time that no one believed he would lose, there was some question about what his margin would have been had the other parties challenged him.

==Candidates==
Eleven candidates stood in the election. None of the three main political parties at the time (the National Party, Labour Party or Alliance) fielded candidates. The candidates were:

*Ian Malcolm Blakie, an Auckland picture framer and art dealer, stood as an independent candidate. He advocated for tax incentives for small businesses, abolition of Maori electorates, reintroducing capital punishment for serious crimes and New Zealand becoming a republic.
*Gary John Barham, an organic farmer of Tauranga, stood under the label &quot;Health for All&quot; (HFA). He was a member of the Green Party and the Toxins Awareness Group which successfully campaigned the Tauranga City Council for a referendum against the use of chemical sprays by the council.
*Ashley Grant Bedford, a Tauranga-based artist, stood for the Help End Marijuana Prohibition (HEMP) movement. A longtime campaigner for legalising Marijuana, his policies were to legalise Marijuana in order to develop a hemp fibre industry in New Zealand.
*Victor Frederick Bryers, a retired engineer, was a candidate for the Christ&#x27;s Ambassadors Union a party of Christian ideals. Bryers was concerned with rising public debt, high unemployment and crime increases saying that the love of money is the root of all evil. He was a candidate at the recent by-elections in Tamaki and Wellington Central.
*Raymond Alan Campbell, an unemployed man from Rotorua, stood for the Aotearoa Partnership. He stated his party believed New Zealand should be the leading country in Polynesia rather than &quot;a colony of an Asian superpower&quot; and advocated for zero immigration. He was also critical of the selling of revenue earning state assets, lack of political accountability and foreign property ownership.
*Lynne Lee, an Auckland transcendental meditation teacher, was the candidate of the Natural Law Party. She was critical of what she saw as &quot;negative, confrontational and adversarial politics&quot; and wanted to fix the cause of problems rather than the symptoms. In particular she was concerned with lowering crime and improving health and wellbeing of New Zealanders.
*Winston Peters, a lawyer and MP for Tauranga, stood as an independent candidate. Peters had resigned from the National Party a month earlier after he was deselected as the party candidate for Tauranga. He had been publicly opposed to many government decisions which he saw as a betrayal of National&#x27;s policy pledges at the 1990 election. During the by-election he campaigned for a referendum on the electorate&#x27;s rights &quot;over the faceless few in Wellington.&quot; National had previously attempted to prevent Peters from seeking re-election for any party or label. Peters successfully challenged the party&#x27;s actions in the High Court in the case &quot;Peters v Collinge&quot; where the court ruled this interfered with democratic process, making it illegal under common law, and thusly legally unenforceable.
*Gregory Mark Pittams, a &#x27;Jacobite revolutionary&#x27; from Auckland, stood for the satirical McGillicuddy Serious Party. Pittams wanted to encourage new crop cultivation by outlawing kiwifruit, potatoes, carrots, brussels sprouts and turnips. At the 1990 election he had stood in the Pakuranga electorate.
*Rhona Sharon Tengblad, an &#x27;Admiral of the Bloke Fleet&#x27; from Waiheke Island, stood for the joke party the Blokes&#x27; Liberation Front. She pledged to sell the Beehive to the United States to repay national debt, move parliament to Waiheke Island, introduce free apples and milk and appoint Linda McCartney as an advisor to Prime Minister Jim Bolger.
*Peter Keith Wakeman, a Christchurch pilot, stood as an independent candidate. He advocated for a compulsory savings scheme, ending goods and services tax refunds on prepaid travel to New Zealand, improving sex education standards and changing the electoral system to Single transferable vote. He also favoured increased spending on health and education with decreasing spending on defence.
*Peter Richard Watson, an accountant from Waipukurau, was a candidate for the &#x27;Silent Majority&#x27;. He was concerned with public spending levels and urged for New Zealanders to become more self-sufficient and less reliant on social spending programmes from central government.

<text>Molong is a small town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia, in Cabonne Shire.

==History==

The name Molong comes from the Aboriginal word for &#x27;all rocks&#x27;.

William Lee of Kelso is said to have had cattle in the area by 1819. He later held property just north of present Molong, around Larras Lee. In 1826, a military and police outpost was established at Molong, on Governor Darling&#x27;s orders, as a step in opening up the government stock reserve west of the Macquarie River for settlement. For its first twenty years the settlement was at a site approximately east of the current location. The present village of Molong was officially gazetted in March 1849. In 1845, Copper was discovered at Copper Hill, just north of the town.

The Historical Museum is housed in a former hotel (1856), built by rubble-mason James Mortal, who sold it in 1861 to John Smith of Gamboola. Smith let the building to a series of publicans and it later became the residence and surgery for a series of doctors. The Historical Society acquired it for use as a museum, in 1969, with help from the Molong Shire Council.

In 1885, a railway line was linked through Molong.

In November 2022 many of the town&#x27;s buildings were damaged in a flood.

== Heritage listings ==
Molong has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Main Western railway: Molong railway station
* SE of Molong Yuranigh Road: Grave of Yuranigh

==Geography==

Molong is located on the Mitchell Highway about west of Sydney and about from the city of Orange, and an elevation of 529 metres above sea level. At the , Molong had a population of 1,621 people. Charles Sturt visited Molong in 1828. Molong was the site of an early copper mine in Australia, located at Copper Hill just outside Molong.

The railway from Sydney reached Molong in 1886; it was later extended to Parkes. A branch railway to Dubbo was opened in 1925 and closed in 1987.

=== Climate ===
Despite Molong&#x27;s elevation, it still manages to have a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) due to its northern latitude, having warm to hot summers and cool to cold winters with the odd snowfall. While mean temperatures have been recorded since 1907 at the site, extreme temperature records are found only between 1957 and 1975.

Perhaps the most extreme weather event to have affected Molong since European settlement was the snowfall on 5 July 1900, having fallen to a depth of in town, with snow drifts in some areas reported to an exceptional depth of .

<doc id="613920" wikidata="Q1123453" url="?curid=613920" title="UEFA Regions' Cup">
<text>The UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup is a football competition for amateur teams in Europe, run by UEFA. It was held for the first time in 1999 and has been played biennially since. The 2023 champions are the Galicia team from Spain.

The competition was created in 1996 as there was no European level competition for amateur teams. The UEFA Amateur Cup, a previous attempt to organise a continental competition for amateurs, had run from 1966 to 1978, but ceased due to lack of interest from both the public and amateur teams themselves. In contrast to today&#x27;s Regions&#x27; Cup, in which amateur regions are represented, the previous competition was for representative amateur national teams.

Each UEFA member nation may enter one representative amateur team into the competition, with regions having to win a domestic amateur competition (such as the FA Inter-League Cup) in order to qualify.

The first two finals were won by teams from the host nation. Thus far, Italy and Spain have been the most successful nation in the competition, with their representatives winning respectively three of the twelve editions.

==Format==
All of the 55 UEFA-affiliated associations are eligible to submit a team to compete in the Regions&#x27; Cup, provided they hold a domestic qualifying competition to decide which team will represent that nation. Smaller member nations, however, are permitted to enter a representative national side. 8 associations have never entered a team as of the 2025 Regions&#x27; Cup: Austria, Denmark, Norway, Kosovo, Cyprus, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and Gibraltar.

Teams were entered by 32 nations for the inaugural tournament in 1999 and competed in one qualifying round. As interest in the tournament grew over the years, the qualifying stage was enlarged and an extra group round added in 2005, scrapping the playoffs added in 2001.

The preliminary round consists of a small number of teams split into groups, with the best from each group being included in the draw for the intermediary round. In the intermediary round, the teams are placed into eight groups of four teams. The teams in each group play each other once and the team finishing top of the group qualifies for the Regions&#x27; Cup finals. The eight group winners are placed into two groups of four for the final tournament and the winners of these two final groups, after each team has played one another once, play in the final, with the winners being crowned champions. Third place is shared between the two teams which finish second in their respective groups.

One aspect of the Regions&#x27; Cup that is different from most other international club tournaments is the hosting of games. As teams play each other once in the preliminary and intermediary rounds, in contrast to the more common two-legged fixtures, each group has all its matches held in one particular region. For example, in the 2009 tournament, all the preliminary Group 1 matches were played in San Marino. Another unusual feature of the Regions&#x27; Cup is the choice of host for the final tournament. In most football tournaments, the host nation or city is decided by the governing body before qualification begins. In the Regions&#x27; Cup, however, the host is chosen only after most of the eight finalist teams have qualified, with one of the qualified regions selected as host.

<text>Skokholm () or Skokholm Island is an island off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales, south of the neighbouring island of Skomer. The surrounding waters are a marine reserve and all are part of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park. Both islands are listed as Sites of Special Scientific Interest.

==Geography==
Skokholm is long and wide, covering . Made up of Old Red Sandstone, its cliffs stand between in the northeast, to in the southwest. Battered by storms, the high cliffs and isolated nature of the island make it a haven for seabirds. There is a rock outcrop close to the centre of the island, which provides shelter to the island&#x27;s only structures. Its greatest height is 55 metres (180 feet).

==History==
Whilst no trees grow on the island in modern times, Skokholm is possibly Norse for &quot;wooded island&quot;, a combination of &quot;skógr&quot; (wood, modern Norwegian: &quot;skog&quot;) and &quot;holmr&quot; (small island, middle English &quot;holm&quot; and modern Scandinavian &quot;holme&quot;), named by the Vikings.

The island is likely to have been settled for several thousand years; evidence of stone-age occupation has been found.

An undated charter is to be found in the British Museum by which William Marshal the Younger, Earl of Pembroke 1219–31, grants to a certain Gilbert de Vale, land in Ireland in exchange for lands in Pembrokeshire, including the island of &#x27;Scogholm&#x27;. The revenue from the island from 1324 to 1472 was recorded in Ministerial Accounts. Some years later, the island was in the hands of Sir John Perrott, supposedly a natural son of Henry VIII. It appears (in Latin) on a 1578 map of Pembrokeshire as &quot;Skokeholme Insul&quot;.

The island was bought for £300 in 1646 by William Philipps, a barrister, and it was kept in the family for the next 360 years. In 2005 his descendant Mrs. Osra Lloyd-Philipps (1920 - 24 March 2005) of Dale Castle died. The trustees of the estate decided to offer the island for sale, with first refusal going to the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, who had managed the island for the last 50 years on their behalf. After a large fundraising effort, the island was successfully purchased in April 2006 for £650,000, and designated a national nature reserve in December 2008.

==Bird observatory==
In 1933, Skokholm started functioning as a bird observatory, the first in Britain, founded by Ronald Lockley; its prime function was the ringing of wild birds of resident, visiting or migrating species and research. Lockley started the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society in 1938, now incorporated in the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales. In 1948 the West Wales Field Society (WWFC), also now Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, first took the Lease of Skokholm from the owners of the Dale Castle Estate. The WWFC followed on the Lease by Ronald Lockley which had run from 1927 but direct involvement commenced two years earlier when in 1946 the bird observatory was re-opened after the war. Ringing on Skokholm ceased from 1976. During the period of radar studies of migration around 1960 it became clear that bird movements as observed at the observatories were by no means representative of the whole and, inevitably, the significance of the observatories in the study of migration waned. Skokholm had been the site of the most thorough British studies of the European storm petrel and razorbill amongst the seabirds and the Eurasian oystercatcher and the northern wheatear amongst the landbirds. &quot;There can be few other islands anywhere in the world that can boast the continuity of biological recordings, save for wartime years, that has taken place on Skokholm.&quot; John Fursdon, Warden 1946. Skokholm Island was re-accredited as a bird observatory in 2014, with resident wardens Richard Brown and Giselle Eagle.

==Natural history==

===Geology===
The island is composed entirely of mudstones and sandstones of late Silurian/early Devonian age assigned to the &#x27;Milford Haven Group&#x27; of the Lower Old Red Sandstone. This suite of rocks was formerly known as the &#x27;Red Marls&#x27;. The strata are folded into a syncline with an east–west axis hence the rocks on the north coast dip inland i.e. to the south, at 25° to 40° whilst those on the south coast also dip inland i.e. to the north, even more steeply, at up to 80°. A couple of north–south aligned faults affect the strata at the eastern end of the island, erosion along them being responsible for both Crab Bay and North Haven.

A couple of areas of till, a relict of the Irish Sea Icesheet from the last Ice Age are smeared across the island&#x27;s surface.

===Flora===
Most of Skokholm is simple sub-maritime grassland, with the wetter areas graded as heath and some salt marsh. All of these areas house common natural species including three-lobed water crowfoot, tree mallow, marsh St. John&#x27;s wort, small nettle, and sea campion.

===Fungi===
Larger fungi were extensively studied in the 1940s and 1950s by Frederick Parker-Rhodes who published a series of papers based on his research on the island. Skokholm is the type locality for the corticioid species &quot;Trechispora clanculare&quot; (Park.-Rhodes) K.H. Larss., described as new to science from the island where it was first found in a puffin burrow. Due to its isolated nature, Skokholm houses British nationally scarce lichens including golden hair lichen (&quot;Teloschistes flavicans&quot;).

===Bird life and larger fauna===
Ronald Lockley, a pioneering ornithologist, especially famous for his work on puffins and shearwaters, wrote many books featuring Skokholm, where he lived and researched for many years.

Skokholm is home to the third largest Manx shearwater colony (15% of world population), and 20% of Europe&#x27;s population of European storm petrel, as well as (in 2008) 4,500 Atlantic puffins and 2,000 common guillemots and razorbills. A survey in 2016 found the population of puffins to be just under 7,000, and that of guillemots to be 4,000, the highest number since 1927. In 2021, the puffin population was in excess of 11,000, the highest since the 1940s. There are also large colonies of lesser black-backed gulls, herring gulls and great black-backed gulls. The island is a breeding site for Eurasian oystercatchers, red-billed chough, Eurasian skylark and northern wheatear.
In addition to the impressive numbers of breeding seabirds, it is a good UK site for passage migrants, including chiffchaff, willow warblers, common whitethroat, common redstart, and spotted and pied flycatchers.

After the Norman invasion of north Pembrokeshire led by Robert fitz Martin, the Normans built a rabbit farm on the island, later revived during the Victorian era. As a result, the island houses an example of long-term rabbit-maintained grass. House mice were accidentally introduced in the late 19th century.

==Buildings==

The first Skokholm Lighthouse was built in 1776, and then rebuilt at its present site in 1861. The lighthouse forms a triangle of protection into Milford Haven along with the lighthouses at South Bishop and the Smalls. Automated in 1983, it is now monitored and controlled from the Trinity House Operations Control Centre at Harwich in Essex. The farm cottage restored by Lockley is a grade II listed building, and the surrounding farm buildings have been converted to accommodation units.

==Transport==
Connecting boats leave from Martin&#x27;s Haven, with booked visitors able to stay on this island in basic accommodation. In 2010, the trust announced improvements to the island&#x27;s landing jetty to allow easier access, with a £38,250 development project funded by Crown Estates and RWE Npower.

<doc id="613923" wikidata="Q698080" url="?curid=613923" title="Uffe Ellemann-Jensen">
<text>Uffe Ellemann-Jensen (, informal: ; 1 November 1941 – 18 June 2022) was a Danish politician who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Denmark in the Conservative-led Poul Schlüter Administration from 1982 to 1993. He was leader of the Danish Liberal Party Venstre from 1984 to 1998 and President of the European Liberals 1995–2000.

In 1998 Ellemann-Jensen founded Baltic Development Forum, a non-profit networking organisation dedicated to the business development of the Baltic Sea region. He was its first chairman from its founding to 2011, and was also honorary chairman following his resignation. He was also non-executive director of various boards of international companies.

== Political career ==

A strong supporter of NATO and the European Union based upon his belief in Western cohesion, Ellemann-Jensen&#x27;s stance led to many political battles with the left-wing opposition. Several times the opposition tried to topple him on issues of solidarity within NATO, but he survived. Uffe Ellemann-Jensen succeeded in convincing a majority in the Danish Parliament, the Folketinget, to actively support the U.S. led coalition against Iraq during the Gulf War. Furthermore, he led the Danish recognition of the renewed independence of the three Baltic countries in 1991, when Denmark was the first country to re-establish diplomatic relations with the three countries.
In 1992, Ellemann-Jensen, together with his German colleague Hans-Dietrich Genscher, took the initiative to create the Council of the Baltic Sea States (CBSS) and the EuroFaculty.

In September 1992, Ellemann-Jensen and other senior officials visited southern Somalia, one of the first foreign delegations to do so since the start of civil war there the year before.

After the fall of the centre-right government, in which he also served as Deputy Prime Minister, in 1993 following the Tamil case, outgoing prime minister Poul Schlüter attempted to have Ellemann-Jensen appointed acting prime minister until Henning Dyremose (Conservative) could take over, but the attempt was dropped as royal cabinet secretary Niels Eilschou Holm considered the maneuver unconstitutional. Instead, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen (Social Democrats) was appointed prime minister following a &quot;Queen&#x27;s round&quot;, and Ellemann-Jensen became leader of the opposition.

Ellemann-Jensen was leader of the opposition until the 1998 general election, which he lost with a single seat. If his party had only 85 more votes, he would have been able to form a new centre-right government as Prime Minister. He decided then to leave politics and his successor as the leader of Venstre was Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who became Prime Minister of Denmark in 2001.

The new active Danish foreign policy continued after Ellemann-Jensen&#x27;s ten-year term as Foreign Minister and ultimately became a turning point in Danish foreign and defence policy. It later became known as the &quot;Ellemann-Jensen doctrine&quot;.

In 1995, Ellemann-Jensen was a candidate for the post of Secretary-General of NATO when Willy Claes was forced to leave the role. He got the support of the U.S. government, but France blocked his candidature, preferring the Spanish candidate, Javier Solana. Ellemann-Jensen never tried to hide his disappointment with not getting the post that he had wanted all his political life.

He participated eight times in the Bilderberg conferences: 1984, 1987 and every year between 1993 and 1998.

After leaving politics, Ellemann-Jensen became a columnist for the Danish daily &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot; and a contributor to Project Syndicate.

Ellemann-Jensen became a central figure in the controversy following the Danish daily Jyllands-Posten&#x27;s decision to print 12 satirical images of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in September 2005. In his column, only days after the cartoons were printed, he argued that he thought the cartoons represented an &quot;unnecessary provocation&quot;, believing they constituted in themselves a caricature of Denmark&#x27;s &quot;cherished freedom of expression&quot;. Ellemann-Jensen remained in that position all through the controversy at the same time never missing an opportunity to support the Danish Prime Minister&#x27;s stance that the government could not and should not take punitive action against the newspaper.

== Personal life ==
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen was the son of a member of the Folketing. In 1971, his first marriage was dissolved and he married Alice Vestergaard. He had four children, among them Jakob Ellemann-Jensen and Karen Ellemann. He was an avid hunter and fly fisher.

== Awards ==
On 18 December 2002, Ellemann-Jensen was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog.

On 12 February 2010, Ellemann-Jensen received the highest accolade of the Republic of Macedonia, the Order 8-September for his contribution to the strengthening of Danish-Macedonian relations and for promotion of Macedonia in its initial years of independence in the early 1990s.

== Illnesses and death ==
In 1989, Ellemann-Jensen underwent surgery for two spinal disc herniations in his neck, but experienced two cervical fractures of his spine during the operation; subsequently, he wore a neck brace for half a year. He had a stent inserted in his heart and, following a blood clot, a pacemaker. He had another blood clot in an IC3 train to Aalborg in 2003, after which he stopped smoking. He furthermore had diabetes. He had a tumor that pressed against his spinal cord removed in 2019. In a 2021 interview with Ellemann-Jensen, it was reported that an &quot;old cancer [...] was stirring again&quot;, and referring to his health problems, he stated that he was &quot;a wandering example of medical science&#x27;s progress&quot;.

In August 2021, the thenfully vaccinated Ellemann-Jensen was admitted to hospital with COVID-19 for three weeks; he was then in further treatment for two weeks. Ellemann-Jensen had a successful prostate cancer surgery at an apparently early stage of the disease in January 2011. Subsequently, however, the cancer flared up again, and on 13 June 2022 he was admitted to Rigshospitalet, where he died on 18 June at the age of 80.

<doc id="613924" wikidata="Q1691036" url="?curid=613924" title="Mount Canobolas">
<text>Mount Canobolas, a mountain on a spur of the Great Dividing Range, is located in the Central Tablelands region of New South Wales, Australia.

With an elevation of above sea level, Mount Canobolas, an extinct volcano, is the highest mountain in the region. Situated southwest of the city of Orange, it is about west of Sydney.

The northern slopes of the mountain, with fertile volcanic soil, is a popular cold-climate wine producing area.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from two words in the Wiradjuri language (the local Aboriginal language), &quot;gaahna&quot; and &quot;bula&quot;. This means &quot;two shoulders&quot; which refers to the summits of Mount Canobolas itself and the subsidiary peak Young Man Canobolas.

== Description ==

Mount Canobolas is an extinct volcanic complex which erupted in several phases between 13 and 11 million years ago, making the mountain a relatively recent geological feature. Earlier eruptions were less violent with free flowing lavas reaching a maximum coverage extent of approximately. Later eruptions became more violent, and producing increasingly viscous lavas with less extensive coverage.

The contemporary landscape of Mount Canobolas exhibits erosional features dominated by several remnant peaks. Additional volcanic features are present within the zone of volcanic influence, including vents, dykes, peaks, domes and plugs.

The mountain&#x27;s geologic history has yielded a variety of landforms which provide a range of environmental habitats, and notably rocky outcrops harbouring rare species of lichens. There are cliff features with waterfalls, such as the popular recreation locality, Federal Falls. Mount Canobolas was listed on the Register of the National Estate because of its geological significance, before the Register was abandoned in 2007.

There is a 360 degree view from the summit, which is often snow-capped in winter. The summit can be seen from up to 100 km away. 

The mountain is now part of the Mount Canobolas Conservation Area, managed by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service, which offers various walks: to Bald Hill; to Young Man Canobolas; Federal Falls to Mount Towac, and other locations. The volcanic peaks give wide views and there are some attractive waterfalls.

Since 1962, with the opening of television stations ABCN-1 and CBN-8, the top of the mountain has been dominated by several towers used for communications, radio and television transmissions across large areas of the Central Tablelands and Central Western Slopes regions. These include towers for television transmitters - Australian Broadcasting Corporation, Prime7 (formerly Prime Television), 10 Regional (formerly Southern Cross Nine and Southern Cross Ten), and WIN Television - and for Airservices Australia and the Royal Australian Air Force.

Each year the Orange community runs the Great Volcanic Mountain Challenge, an walk and fun run from the Pinnacle to the Summit of Mount Canobolas by the volcanic plugs of Mount Towac and Young Man Canobolas. The inaugural event was held in 2006.

== Fires on the mountain ==
A major bushfire in 1967 affected 415 ha in the northern section of the Mount Canobolas Conservation Area. Another bushfire in 1982 affected 414 ha in the western part of the conservation area and a further bushfire occurred in the southern part of the conservation area in 1985. 

Another bushfire affected most of the northern area of Mount Canobolas in February 2018, and the entire Mount Canobolas Conservation Area apart from the summit remains closed (as of mid 2020) until the effects of this fire - the danger of falling trees and branches and damage to much of the walking track infrastructure - are rectified.

Bushire frequency on Mount Canobolas is poorly recorded, however it is believed to be quite low. The floristic composition suggests that the vegetation has evolved largely in the absence of regular intense fire. Information from local landholders indicates that the mountain was subjected to annual low intensity burning by previous occupiers to maintain fresh feed for their stock during the 1940s and 1950s.

== Highest point claims ==
Mount Canobolas is not, as is sometimes claimed in tourism brochures, the highest point between Australia&#x27;s Great Dividing Range and Africa, as Mount Zeil in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory and Ngarutjaranya in South Australia are further west and higher, and a number of peaks elsewhere on the Great Dividing Range and peaks on Madagascar and Réunion are higher. It is, however, the highest point in a direct east-west line between the Blue Mountains and the western coast of Australia.

<text>Ophir is the name of a locality in New South Wales, Australia in Cabonne Shire.

==History and discovery==

Ophir is located near the Macquarie River northeast of the city of Orange. Ophir is the place where gold was first discovered in New South Wales in 1851, leading to the Australian gold rushes. In popular literature it has been stated that William Tom Jr, John Lister and Edward Hargraves found payable gold in February 1851 at the &quot;Ophir gold diggings&quot;, located at the confluence of Summer Hill Creek and Lewis Ponds Creek (). Hargraves was awarded £10,500 (worth $1,125,434 in 2004 values) by the NSW Government.

William Tom&#x27;s father (Parson Tom) named the area &#x27;Ophir&#x27;, after a region in the Old Testament noted for its fine gold.

There was a gold rush to the area in 1851 and 1852. The village of Ophir was laid out in 1851 by Major Sir Thomas Livingstone Mitchell, its first lots were sold in 1852. Reef gold was discovered in 1868 by Joseph Christopherson.

Although Hargraves was honoured and rewarded, it may have been William Tipple Smith mineralogist, who first discovered gold at what would be later named Ophir, in 1848. On 27 February 1852 William Tipple Smith wrote to geologist Sir Roderick Murchison in England saying the spot now called Ophir was the very spot where he had found nugget gold in 1848. Smith&#x27;s claims and correspondence are exhaustively studied in a 1986 book &quot;A Fool&#x27;s Gold?&quot; by Lynette Ramsay Silver, in the foreword of which geology Professor David Branagan of Sydney University concurs and states &quot;It is good to see him deservedly remembered in the pages of this book&quot;. William Tipple Smith was one of the owners of the Fitzroy Iron Works at Mittagong and, during a visit in February 1849, Governor Charles Augustus Fitz Roy was presented with a steel knife &quot;mounted with colonial gold&quot;.

Some remnants of old alluvial, reef, and deep lead mines, are located within the Ophir Reserve, which includes the former site of the town. The town&#x27;s cemetery also remains. There is an obelisk that commemorates the discovery of payable gold, in 1851, giving credit to Edward Hargraves, John Lister, James Tom, and William Tom.

All that remains of William Tipple Smith is one small gold sample and a previously unmarked grave (number 4929, section 4, Rookwood Cemetery) that was only recently provided with a headstone recognising him as the discoverer of the first payable gold in Australia.

<doc id="613928" wikidata="Q1351810" url="?curid=613928" title="Skomer">
<text>Skomer () or Skomer Island is an island off the coast of Pembrokeshire, in the community of Marloes and St Brides in west Wales. It is well known for its wildlife: around half the world&#x27;s population of Manx shearwaters nest on the island, the Atlantic puffin colony is the largest in southern Britain, and the Skomer vole (a subspecies of the bank vole) is unique to the island. Skomer is a national nature reserve, a Site of Special Scientific Interest and a Special Protection Area. It is surrounded by a marine nature reserve and is managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales.

Skomer is known for its archaeological interest: stone circles, standing stone and remains of prehistoric houses. Much of the island has been designated an ancient monument.

==Description==
The island has an area of . Its highest point is above sea level at Gorse Hill, while the majority of the island sits at around above sea level. Skomer is intersected by a series of slopes and ridges giving it a rich and varied topography. It is approximately from north–south and east–west.

The island is almost cut in two near its eastern side by two bays. It is one of several islands lying within 1000 yards (a kilometre) of the Pembrokeshire coast. A number of islets surround Skomer, the largest of which are: Midland Isle (height ) separated from Skomer by Little Sound, Mew Stone (height ) and Garland Stone (height ).

==Name==
The name Skomer derives from &quot;Skalmey&quot;, a name of Viking origin meaning &quot;Cleft island&quot;, possibly from the fact that the eastern end of the island is nearly cut off from the main part. It is marked on a 1578 map in Latin as &quot;Scaline Insul&quot;, with the first word probably meaning &quot;scalene&quot; or &quot;unequal&quot;.

==Geology==
The volcanic rocks of which Skomer is comprised date from the Silurian period around 440 million years ago. A series of basalts, rhyolites, felsites, keratophyres, mugearite and associated sedimentary rocks (quartzites, etc.) are grouped together as the &#x27;Skomer Volcanic Series&#x27;. The series which is up to 1000 metres (3000&#x27;) thick also includes trachyte, dolerite and skomerite which is an altered andesite. Basalt is the most common component of this sequence; some of it appears as pillow lava indicating that it was erupted under water. Other basalt flows show signs of contemporary subaerial weathering.

This same suite of rocks can also be traced eastwards on the mainland along the northern side of the Marloes peninsula and extends almost as far east as St Ishmael&#x27;s. The entire sequence on Skomer dips between 15° and 25° to the south-southeast. It is cut by several faults, notably those responsible for the erosion of the inlets of North Haven and South Haven. A NW-SE aligned fault stretches between Bull Hole and South Haven, offsetting the strata on either side.

Skomer was cut off from the mainland by rising sea levels after the last Ice Age.

==History==
There is evidence of human occupation—field boundaries and settlement remains—dating back to the Iron Age.

The Skomer Island Project, run jointly by the Royal Commission for Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales (RCAHMW) with archaeologists from the University of Sheffield and Cardiff University, started in 2011, investigates the island&#x27;s prehistoric communities. Airborne laser scanning together with ground excavations continued in 2016 and established that human settlement dates back 5,000 years. Rabbits were introduced in the 14th century and their burrows and grazing have had a profound effect on the island landscape.

It was last permanently inhabited by the Codd family (all year round) in 1950. After the Second World War, the owner had offered the West Wales Field Society, now The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales, the opportunity to make a survey of Skomer which was accepted and Skomer opened for visitors from April 1946. The farm buildings in the centre of the island, now housing visitor accommodation, were refurbished in 2005. Skomer was featured in the BBC TV documentary &quot;Coast&quot; in Episode 4 of Series 5 (first aired August 2010).

David Saunders MBE was in 1960 the first warden of Skomer. In 1963, the &quot;Look at Life&quot; documentary series featured Skomer and its nature, and Saunders&#x27; role as warden and his home life with his wife and family.

==Wildlife==
Skomer is best known for its large breeding seabird population, including Manx shearwaters, guillemots, razorbills, great cormorants, black-legged kittiwakes, Atlantic puffins, European storm-petrels, common shags, Eurasian oystercatchers and gulls, as well as birds of prey including short-eared owls, common kestrels and peregrine falcons. The island is also home to grey seals, common toads, slow-worms, a breeding population of glow-worms and a variety of wildflowers. Harbour porpoises and Common dolphins regularly occur in the surrounding waters. The Skomer vole, a subspecies of bank vole, is endemic to the island.

===Atlantic puffin===
There are around 41,000 puffins on Skomer Island, making it one of the most important puffin colonies in Britain. They arrive in mid-April to nest in burrows, many of which were originally dug by the island&#x27;s large rabbit population. The last puffins leave the island by the second or third week in July. They feed mainly on small fish and sand eels; often puffins can be seen with up to a dozen small eels in their beaks.

After a period of declining numbers between the 1950s and 1970s, the size of the colony is growing again at 1–2% a year (). By 2004, there were numerous puffin burrows on the island and adults flying back with food run across the walkways oblivious to the tourists. A 2019 survey estimated a population of 24,108 birds, and in 2020 this had increased to 34,796 birds.

===Manx shearwater===
In 2011, an estimated 310,000 pairs of Manx shearwater were breeding on Skomer, with around 40,000 pairs on the &quot;sister&quot; island Skokholm. A 2019 survey estimated the Skomer population at almost 350,000, a 10 per cent increase. The colony comprises around half the world population and make the islands the world&#x27;s most important breeding site for the species. The birds nest in burrows, which they either excavate themselves or commandeer from other burrow-making species, such as rabbits. Pairs will typically use the same burrow year after year.

Shearwaters are not easy to see as they come and go at night, but a closed-circuit television camera in one of the burrows allows subterranean nesting activity to be seen on the screen in Lockley Lodge on the mainland at Martin&#x27;s Haven. The remains of shearwaters killed by the island&#x27;s population of great black-backed gulls can also be seen.

The young Manx shearwaters remain at sea for five years before returning to breed on their natal island. On their return they navigate back to within a few metres (yards) of the burrow in which they were born. As they are ungainly and vulnerable on the land, they leave their burrows only at night to avoid predation by gulls also breeding on the island. They head for the fishing grounds some 30 miles (fifty kilometres) north out in the Irish Sea. Manx shearwater chicks fledge in late August and September and immediately migrate south to the coastlines of South America to overwinter, before returning back to UK waters the next spring.

===Skomer vole===
Skomer has one unique mammal: the Skomer vole (&quot;Myodes glareolus skomerensis&quot;), a distinct subspecies of the bank vole. The lack of land-based predators on the island means that the bracken habitat is an ideal place for the vole, with the population reaching around 20,000 during the summer months. Then the resident short-eared owls may be seen patrolling the areas close to the farmhouse in the centre of the island for voles to feed their young.

==Lichens==
Skomer Island supports a diverse and ecologically significant lichen flora, with 248 recorded species (as of 1995), including numerous saxicolous (rock-dwelling) species that grow in the island&#x27;s exposed maritime environment. The lichen communities on the island shows well-defined zonation patterns, influenced by rock type, exposure to salt spray, and nutrient enrichment from the island&#x27;s abundant seabird populations. The lower littoral zone is dominated by &quot;Hydropunctaria maura&quot; and associated species, forming a black crust on wave-exposed rocks. Above this, a striking yellow-orange band is created by Teloschistaceae-family lichens, such as &quot;Caloplaca marina&quot; and &quot;Verrucoplaca verruculifera&quot;, while the xeric-supralittoral zone supports communities dominated by &quot;Ramalina siliquosa&quot; and other maritime lichens. In areas with high levels of seabird activity, nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich guano influences the composition of lichen communities, promoting the growth of species such as &quot;Xanthoria parietina&quot; and &quot;Candelariella coralliza&quot; on bird-perching rocks.

Several rare and biogeographically significant lichens occur on Skomer, including &quot;Roccella fuciformis&quot;, a Mediterranean-Atlantic species at its northern limit, and &quot;Teloschistes flavicans&quot;, a species of conservation concern in Britain. The island&#x27;s geological diversity, with acid rhyolites, basaltic lavas, and quartz conglomerates, further contributes to the variety of lichen habitats. Monitoring programs have been established to track long-term changes in lichen populations, particularly in response to fluctuations in seabird numbers and environmental disturbances such as oil pollution. The 1996 Sea Empress oil spill raised concerns about potential impacts on Skomer&#x27;s maritime lichens, highlighting the need for ongoing conservation efforts.

==Access==

The &quot;Dale Princess&quot; sails to Skomer from Martin&#x27;s Haven on the mainland, a sheltered 15-minute trip every day (weather dependent) except Monday (Whitsun Bank Holiday Monday excepted) from April to September between 10am and noon (actual times may vary). There are limits on the number of people allowed to visit the island (250 per day). Advance booking is recommended after the introduction of a new visitor management system in 2020.

A self-catering hostel with 16 beds is situated at the farm in the centre of the island. Booking opens in October and can only be done by phoning the Tondu office. Overnight guests are brought over on a separate boat trip on the morning of their stay and the hostel is open April to September.

Areas open for visitor access are restricted to pathways. The Neck, an eastern area connected only by a narrow isthmus, is entirely out of bounds to visitors.

In 2005–06, there was a renovation project of the farm buildings which included the old barn for improved overnight visitor and research accommodation, the volunteers&#x27; quarters were rebuilt and the warden&#x27;s house at North Haven was also rebuilt. Solar power provides hot water and electricity for lighting.

<text>Century Child is the fourth studio album by Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish. It was released in 2002 through Spinefarm Records in Finland, Drakkar Entertainment in the rest of Europe, Century Media Records in the US, and Toy&#x27;s Factory in Japan. It is the first album which features now-former bassist and male vocalist Marko Hietala, who left the band in January 2021. It is also the first Nightwish album to feature an orchestra.

Spinefarm Records released a 2-CD special edition of the album in 2002. It includes liner art with the band members&#x27; signatures, and a Video CD containing the music video for their cover of Gary Moore&#x27;s &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away&quot;. In addition, the booklet contains an ID code that allows the owner to download the entire album and three extra tracks from the Internet for a limited time. The bonus tracks are &quot;Nightwish&quot;, &quot;The Forever Moments&quot; and &quot;Etiäinen&quot;, all from the band&#x27;s first demo of 1996.

The album was certified double platinum in Finland with more than 60,000 sold copies, the second best selling album of 2002 in Finland. &quot;Century Child&quot; has sold more than 80,000 copies in Finland alone.

<text>An anorectic is a drug that reduces appetite, resulting in lower food consumption, leading to weight loss. These substances work by affecting the central nervous system or certain neurotransmitters to create a feeling of fullness or reduce the desire to eat. The understanding of anorexiant effects is crucial in the development of interventions for weight management, eating disorders, and related health concerns. The anorexiant effect can be induced through diverse mechanisms, ranging from hormonal regulation to neural signaling. Ghrelin, leptin, and peptide YY are among the hormones involved in appetite control. Additionally, neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine in the central nervous system contribute significantly to the regulation of food intake.

By contrast, an appetite stimulant is referred to as orexigenic.

The term is (from the Greek and ), and such drugs are also known as anorexigenic, anorexiant, or appetite suppressant.

==History==
Used on a short-term basis clinically to treat obesity, some appetite suppressants are also available over-the-counter. Several appetite suppressants are based on a mix of natural ingredients, mostly using green tea as its basis, in combination with other plant extracts, such as fucoxanthin, found naturally in seaweed. Drugs of this class are frequently stimulants of the phenethylamine family, related to amphetamine.

The German and Finnish militaries issued amphetamines (Pervitin) to soldiers commonly during the Second World War. Similarly, the UK military was supplied with more than 72 million Benzedrine tablets and the US military with an approximately equal amount for situations, in which fatigue was not deemed to be an acceptable option. Following the war, large amphetamine surpluses were redirected for use on the black and the civilian market. Indeed, amphetamine itself was sold commercially as an appetite suppressant until it was outlawed in most parts of the world in the late 1950s because of safety issues. Many amphetamines produce side effects, including addiction, tachycardia and hypertension, making prolonged unsupervised use dangerous.

==Public health concerns==
Epidemics of fatal pulmonary hypertension and heart valve damage associated with pharmaceutical anorectic agents have led to the withdrawal of products from the market. This was the case with aminorex in the 1960s, and again in the 1990s with fenfluramine (&quot;see:&quot; Fen-phen). Likewise, association of the related appetite suppressant phenylpropanolamine with hemorrhagic stroke led the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request its withdrawal from the market in the United States in 2000, and similar concerns regarding ephedrine resulted in an FDA ban on its inclusion in dietary supplements in 2004. A Federal judge later overturned this ban in 2005 during a challenge by supplement maker Nutraceuticals. It is also debatable as to whether the ephedrine ban had more to do with its use as a precursor in methamphetamine manufacture rather than health concerns with the ingredient as such.

===Non-pharmacological alternatives===
Weight loss effects of water have been subject to some scientific research as a potential non-pharmacological approach. Drinking water prior to each meal may help in appetite suppression. Consumption of of water 30 minutes before meals has been correlated with modest weight loss () in obese men and women over a period of 8 to 12 weeks.

===Refeeding syndrome===
Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a metabolic disturbance which occurs as a result of reinstitution of nutrition in people and animals who are starved, severely malnourished, or metabolically stressed because of severe illness. When too much food or liquid nutrition supplement is eaten during the initial four to seven days following a malnutrition event, the production of glycogen, fat and protein in cells may cause low serum concentrations of potassium, magnesium and phosphate. The electrolyte imbalance may cause neurologic, pulmonary, cardiac, neuromuscular, and hematologic symptoms—many of which, if severe enough, may result in death.

Refeeding syndrome can occur when someone does not eat for several days at a time usually beginning after 4–5 days with no food.

Individuals with drug abuse who begin to reintroduce normal eating habits after a period of malnutrition may be at increased risk for refeeding syndrome.

== List of anorectics ==
Numerous pharmaceutical compounds are marketed as appetite suppressants.

The following drugs are listed as &quot;centrally-acting antiobesity preparations&quot; in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System:
* Amfepramone (also known as diethylpropion)

<doc id="613934" wikidata="Q47192678" url="?curid=613934" title="Eildon Dam">
<text>The Eildon Dam is a rock and earth-fill embankment dam with a controlled spillway, located on the Goulburn River between the regional towns of and within Lake Eildon National Park, in the Alpine region of Victoria, Australia. The dam&#x27;s purpose is for the supply of potable water, irrigation, and the generation of hydroelectricity. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Eildon.The first cut of ground was done by Mr Bain and Mr MacLean from Scotland.

==Location and features==
Designed by the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria, construction of the original water storage, which was known as Sugarloaf Reservoir, took place between 1915 and 1929 to provide irrigation water for what was a vast uncultivated area on Victoria&#x27;s northern plains. The original weir was modified in 1929, and again in 1935, to increase the storage capacity to . However, this reservoir was still limited in its capacity to meet the growing demand for water in the Goulburn Valley and to protect farmers during drought years. Following a detailed feasibility study of all possible storage sites on the Goulburn River, it was decided that the existing dam site was the most suitable for construction of a larger dam. In 1951, work began to enlarge the storage to its present capacity. The enlargement was completed in 1955 and the storage was renamed Lake Eildon.

The embankment dam wall is constructed with an earth core and rock fill, rising to a height of . The core component materials of the wall include of rock and earth. With a catchment area of that includes the Goulburn, Delatite, Howqua, Big, and Jamieson rivers and several minor tributaries, the reservoir covers an area of . The reservoir has a capacity of with an average depth of , and can release a maximum outflow of approximately via its controlled spillway. The crest of the uncontrolled spillway is and is approximately long.

Lake Eildon is connected to the metropolitan water supply of Melbourne, the state capital, via a pipeline from the Goulburn River. On average, 91% of the water from Lake Eildon goes to the Goulburn Weir and the Waranga Basin before it flows to irrigators in the Goulburn Valley system.

===Power generation===
Operated by AGL Energy, Eildon Hydroelectric Power Station is a hydroelectric power station that operates during the irrigation season from August to May. Its operation is mainly governed by release of water to meet irrigation demands, but it may also be operated during winter and spring when flood releases can be used to generate electricity. The power station can also be used to meet short-term emergency power needs resulting from industrial disputes or plant breakdown elsewhere in the State&#x27;s power grid. Initially completed as part of the Sugarloaf Reservoir with just of hydroelectric generating power, capacity was increased by 1957 to through the installation of two turbines. The first turbine was commissioned in 1956, and a second in 1957. In addition, there are two turbines; these were decommissioned in 1971, but recommissioned in 2001. These smaller turbines were relocated from the former Sugarloaf Power Station on the Eildon Weir, completed in 1929 and in use until work on the larger dam started in 1951. This renovation of the oldest turbines in 2001 led to a generation capacity of . A pondage below the dam temporarily detains water discharged from the power station and regulates releases downstream to minimise variations in flow due to intermittent power generation. In 1995 the Eildon Pondage Power Station, a small hydro-electric station with output was installed on the pondage. In 2024, AGL studied the options of expanding the scheme with pumped-storage hydroelectricity.

Eildon Power Station has four turbo generators, with a total generating capacity of of electricity. It produces an average of around of electricity per annum.

=== Houseboats ===
As the only inland waterway where houseboats are permitted, Lake Eildon has a thriving houseboat culture with over 700 on the lake. There is a Private Harbour and a Public Harbour. Rental of houseboats is possible in the latter. Some boats are restricted to daytime operation due to lack of lighting. The Private Harbour manages the owners&#x27; houseboats with staff and facilities that cater to over 18 marinas. Both harbours provide fueling facilities.

==Drought and recovery==
During the drought years in Victoria in the 2000s, Lake Eildon rarely filled and the once-thriving holiday destinations around the lake were unable to attract visitors, leading to considerable economic hardship. Although water is in great demand for agriculture, careful regulation has kept outflows fairly static. During November 2006 the lake dropped to a low of only 15% from the previous year level of 48.3%. The lake reached as low as 5.3% in 2007.

After many years with below average rainfall, 2010 saw Lake Eildon receive above average rainfall and rose from 23% of capacity in May 2010 to be 82.5% as of March 2011. On the night of 13 October 2022, Lake Eildon inflows peaked at 145,000 megalitres per day, decreasing overnight to 100,000, far above the dam&#x27;s maximum outflow of 38,000 megalitres per day with the spill gates open. On 15 October 2022, due to an abnormal amount of rain in the region, the lake filled up to 100.3% of its capacity for the first time since 1994. Because the spillway gates were raised, this raised the height of the dam allowing more water into the reservoir than is normally able.

==Climate==

Lake Eildon is most notable for its extraordinary cloud cover in winter, measuring only 69 sun hours in June; this is especially cloudy for a location at only 37 degrees of latitude. Summers are generally warm and sunny, though with the passage of cold fronts are normally interspersed with much cooler days and nights.

Eildon Fire Tower to the west-northwest is higher in altitude and located on an exposed hilltop. Snowfalls are common here and cloud cover is extremely heavy in the winter months, as evident from the mean afternoon humidity readings in June and July. Cold weather can be present at any time of the year; with a daily maximum of having occurred on 1 December 2019, and on 3 February 2005.

==In film==
The nearby town of Bonnie Doon was the location for the holiday scenes in the movie, &quot;The Castle&quot;. Lake Eildon was also the main location used for the 1975 feature film version of &quot;The Box,&quot; as well as the 1989 direct-to-video Australian horror film &quot;Houseboat Horror&quot;.

<text>Barrier Highway is a highway in South Australia and New South Wales, and is designated part of route A32. The name of the highway is derived from the Barrier Ranges, an area of moderately high ground in the far west of New South Wales, through which the highway traverses.
==Route==
Barrier Highway branches off Horrocks Highway at Giles Corner, between Riverton and Tarlee and heads northeast, crossing the border into New South Wales and passing through Broken Hill. It continues further east to Wilcannia where it crosses the Darling River, past Cobar to eventually end in Nyngan, where it joins Mitchell Highway. The area traversed by the highway is remote and very sparsely settled.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (later Transport for NSW). Barrier Highway was declared (as Main Road No. 8) on 8 August 1928, from the intersection with North-Western Highway (today Mitchell Highway) in Nyngan, via Cobar, Willcannia, and Broken Hill, to the border with South Australia; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to State Highway 8 in April 1929.

The highway was fully sealed in October 1972.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales, updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Barrier Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 8, from Nyngan to the state border with South Australia.

Barrier Highway was signed as National Route 32 across its entire length in 1955. With both states&#x27; conversion to their newer alphanumeric systems in 1998 and 2013, its former route number was updated to A32 for the highway within South Australia in 1998, and within New South Wales in 2013.

<text>Wilcannia is a small town located within the Central Darling Shire in north western New South Wales, Australia. Located on the Darling River, the town was the third largest inland port in the country during the river boat era of the mid-19th century. At the , Wilcannia had a population of 735.

==History==
The area lies in the traditional lands of the Barkindji people, who call the river &quot;Baaka&quot;. The name Wilcannia is said to be derived from an indigenous term for either &quot;gap in the bank where floodwaters escape&quot; or &quot;wild dog&quot;. Neither meaning has been linguistically verified.

In 1835, explorer Major Thomas Mitchell was the first European to reach the region, when he traced the Darling River to what is now Menindee.

In late January 1859, Captain Francis Cadell, in charge of the river boat &quot;Albury&quot;, entered the Darling River at its junction with the Murray and, after eight days travel, reached the Mount Murchison pastoral station, held by Hugh and Bushby Jamieson. Flour and other stores were delivered to the station and one hundred bales of wool were loaded for the return journey. Cadell&#x27;s pioneering journey was the beginning of river boat transport on the Darling River (when river conditions allowed). The site of the future township developed as the location for the unloading and loading of river-borne cargo. The settlement was initially known as Mount Murchison, taking its name from the nearby pastoral run. As economic activity increased, the location attracted business and trades providing services and amenities to the surrounding stations.

In June 1866, the New South Wales Department of Lands formally declared &quot;portions of Crown Lands&quot; to be set apart as a site for the town of Wilcannia. Despite the official proclamation, the older name for the settlement persisted. In March 1867, a correspondent from the town wrote that: &quot;the township of Mount Murchison is fast springing into importance, owing to the splendid country surrounding it, and which is fast being taken up for pastoral pursuits. We have public houses, stores, butchers&#x27; shops, boarding houses, a cordial manufactory in full operation, and a colonial ale brewery in course of erection&quot;.

The Post Office had opened as Mount Murchison on 1 January 1860. It was moved 5 kms to the town and changed name to Wilcannia on 1 June 1868. There was, however, no telegraph office - &quot;the want of which is sorely felt by the business people of the town, and in fact the whole district&quot;. The Telegraph line reached Wilcannia on 2 February 1878 and was combined with the Post Office on 16 March 1878 in a temporary location. The &quot;handsome building&quot; shown here was constructed from freestone in 1880 and was occupied on 27 June.

In 1871, the population of Wilcannia was 264, consisting of 176 males and 88 females. In January 1874, the township&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Wilcannia Times&quot;, began publication.

An account of Wilcannia in December 1874 described the buildings in the town as &quot;on the whole being of a very poor description, principally small weatherboard places, many of them looking rather dilapidated&quot;. Three stores were operating in the township, as well as three public houses: the Mount Murchison Hotel, Wilcannia Hotel and Britannia Hotel. There were signs of increased commercial activity in the township: two banks, the Australian Joint Stock Bank and the Commercial Bank, had recently opened branches, and four stock and station agents had started businesses &quot;within the last three months&quot;. Wilcannia had a public school, but no churches. There were two doctors, &quot;but as it is a very rare thing to find them otherwise than drunk, they are worse than useless&quot;.

Early on Wilcannia had a significant Chinese community. &quot;The Chinamen here are doing a very thriving trade, and they are extending themselves gradually, but very surely. They are taking root very firmly, especíally in the baking and refreshment line, and they seem to be patronised by everybody here. We have a China doctor, who is a &quot;perfect cure,&quot; so people say that know all about it. Nearly all the cooks at the hotels are restaurants are Chinese; all the gardeners are Chinese to a man. We have another institution added to us in the shape of a Chinese laundry. He, the laundry man, performs his work very well, and gets paid very handsomely for it.” This same report claimed the population of Wilcania at the time to be around 1,000 people with 70 of these being Chinese.

In December 1880, a second local newspaper, the &quot;Western Grazier&quot;, began publication in Wilcannia. By early 1881 patients were being treated in the newly built local hospital. At the census of 1881 the population of Wilcannia was recorded as 1,424 (976 males and 448 females). Wilcannia was incorporated as a municipality in February 1883, with Edmond O&#x27;Donnell elected its first mayor. The first major project of the municipality was the construction of water supply system for the township. A July 1884 report stated that Wilcannia had a population &quot;of about 1200&quot;, and was described as a township &quot;of well-laid-out streets and good buildings&quot;, situated &quot;in the centre of a large sheep country&quot;. In addition to the well-constructed Post and Telegraph Office, several of the stores (&quot;notably Frew, Wright, and Co., J. Palmer and Co., and Cramsie, Bowden, and Co.&quot;) were described as &quot;not only extensive but of considerable architectural beauty&quot;. It was explained that a quarry of freestone &quot;of excellent quality&quot;, within of the township &quot;has been largely used for building purposes&quot;. The only local industry of note was a brewery.

Wilcannia was the location of a customs station on the Darling River. It was described as a &quot;large and important centre of trade, where in 1881 £13,100 was collected as Customs revenue&quot;. The river trade during the 1880s was so extensive at Wilcannia that its Customs House was &quot;probably the largest inland Customs Station in New South Wales&quot;.

When river conditions permitted travel by steamers Wilcannia was a major port on the Darling River. A visitor to the town described the river scene in 1890:
::There are several wharves (so-called) which were merely graduated slopes cut out of the river bank, and in the wool season the river, in their vicinity, is thronged with steamers and barges, waiting for or unloading the season&#x27;s clip, for the bulk of it goes away either to Bourke, for Sydney, or to Wentworth, or Goolwa. A barge, laden with from 1,200 to 2,000 bales of wool is a pretty sight; and a still more interesting spectacle is a string of 30 or 40 camels, each carrying two bales, proceeding into town from some far back station.

At the time of the 1891 census the municipality of Wilcannia had a non-Aboriginal population of 1,287 (775 males and 512 females). In 1907, the number of Aboriginal people living at Wilcannia was 18.

Vehicles and stock were crossed over the Darling River at Wilcannia by a punt operated by Charles Smith until the mid-1890s. In 1895 a bridge was constructed at Wilcannia and opened to traffic in January 1896. The bridge consisted of five spans, a total length of 310 feet (94.5 metres) with a centre lift span &quot;to permit of steamers passing when the river is high&quot;.

In January 1917 it was reported that the Wilcannia Hospital was &quot;without a doctor&quot;. The hospital was &quot;full of patients, some diphtheria cases among them, and the Matron is having a very hard and anxious time&quot;.

In December 1939 Wilcannia was described as &quot;merely a shopping centre for the wide district, although people travelling into Queensland and lonely sections of New South Wales often rest there&quot;.

== Geography ==
Wilcannia is located where the Barrier Highway crosses the Darling River, from Sydney. The environment is borderline semi-arid to desert with an annual rainfall of . Wilcannia is located within the Darling Riverine Plains Bioregion (IBRA classification, Department of Environment), consisting of landscapes adapted to flooding. Common species include river red gum, yellow box, oldman saltbush, and lignum.

The surrounding area is very sparsely settled by pastoralists who have large land holdings, used primarily to run sheep. These holdings fall in the Western Division and the majority are held as 99-year leases.

==Climate==
Wilcannia has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification, featuring long, very hot and dry summers and short, cool to mild winters. The annual average rainfall is which would make it a semi-arid climate except that its high evapotranspiration, or its barrenness, makes it a desert climate.

Mean maximum daily temperature in summer is 35 °C and in winter is 18 °C. The highest temperature recorded in Wilcannia was on 11 January 1939. This was during a severe statewide heatwave from which many towns still retain their highest temperature readings.

===Significant weather===
On 9 November 1950, a severe thunderstorm with damaging winds and large hail the size of cricket balls struck the town. Two people were injured, dozens of homes lost their roofs and nearly every house in town was damaged due to the large hail.

==Facilities==
Wilcannia Central School includes a pre-school and caters for students up to Year 12 (with the last two years through distance education). At the 2020 ARIA Music Awards, Wilcannia Central School&#x27;s Sarah Donnelley won Music Teacher of the Year.

Construction work began on the Baaka Cultural Centre in August 2023, on the main road through Wilcannia. Its shape resembles the foot of an emu, and it will function as a tourist centre as well as a gallery for local art and artefacts. Local people are being employed, as well as specialists in stonemasonry and rammed earth construction from South Australia and the NSW south coast. &quot;Baaka&quot; is the Paakantyi word for the Darling River.

The only local radio station is community radio station Wilcannia River Radio, broadcasting on 103.1 MHz, which has provided factual information and aired discussions about matters such as COVID-19, climate change, and other matters. Other radio stations include Outback Radio 2WEB on 99.9 MHz, ABC Radio National, and ABC Western Plains.

== Transport ==

=== Public transport ===

Wilcannia is served by NSW TrainLink coaches between Dubbo railway station and Broken Hill, which stop in town and at the Emmdale Roadhouse down the Barrier Highway. Bus route 595 also connects the town to Broken Hill.

=== Airport ===
Wilcannia Airport (IATA: WIO, ICAO: YWCA) is 9 kilometers (6 miles) from the centre of Wilcannia. The airport has an asphalt runway of 3,051 feet and a clay runway of 3,701 feet. It is located at the coordinates 31°31′10″S 143°22′50″E.

== Demographics and disadvantage==

From the 2016 Census, Wilcannia had a population of 549 with 407 (74.4%) people being of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander descent, mostly from the Barkindji nation. Wilcannia has 223 private dwellings. The town was listed as one of the most socially disadvantaged areas of New South Wales according to the 2015 &quot;Dropping Off The Edge&quot; report.

Predominantly populated by Aboriginal Australians, Wilcannia has received national and international attention for government deprivation of its community&#x27;s needs, and the low life expectancy of its residents. For Indigenous men, that figure is 37 years of age.

Residents have reported that water quality in Wilcannia is unsafe, leading locals to rely on boxed water transported from Broken Hill, nearly away. In 2021 the town was one of the worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic in New South Wales, and the government&#x27;s refusal to ban tourists from the area to preserve the health of its struggling residents was criticised. In September 2021, the New Matilda website published an investigation into allegations of discrimination against Wilcannia residents during the COVID-19 pandemic, citing leaked documents from Central Darling Shire Council.

=== In the media ===
The town&#x27;s social issues were highlighted in the first episode of a two-part BBC3 documentary made by Reggie Yates, &quot;Reggie Yates: Hidden Australia&quot;, entitled &quot;Episode 1: Black in the Outback&quot;, which was first broadcast online on 16 January 2017. In March 2017 the BBC, in response to complaints about the biased and misleading view portrayed, investigated the claims and suspended the production company pending the outcome of the review. The BBC apologised for allowing the programme to go to air.

In July 2017, ABC Radio National highlighted Wilcannia&#x27;s positive social aspects in a 6-part series called &quot;Positively Wilcannia&quot;, produced by the podcast &quot;The Real Thing&quot;.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia, multiple media outlets highlighted how poor living conditions and overcrowding in houses in Wilcannia resulted in the town having Australia&#x27;s highest per-capita case rate, with one-sixth of residents testing positive to the virus; about 90% of them were Aboriginal. A parliamentary inquiry into New South Wales&#x27; handling of the pandemic was told that community leaders warned authorities a year earlier about how Wilcannia&#x27;s overcrowding situation could lead to a crisis if the virus entered the town.

<text>In cryptography, Square (sometimes written S) is a block cipher invented by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen. The design, published in 1997, is a forerunner to Rijndael, which has been adopted as the Advanced Encryption Standard. Square was introduced together with a new form of cryptanalysis discovered by Lars Knudsen, called the &quot;Square attack&quot;.

The structure of Square is a substitution–permutation network with eight rounds, operating on 128-bit blocks and using a 128-bit key.

Square is not patented.

<doc id="613947" wikidata="Q334871" url="?curid=613947" title="Reza Pahlavi, Crown Prince of Iran">
<text>Reza Pahlavi (; born 31 October 1960) is the eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the former Shah of Iran, and his wife Farah Diba. He was officially named Crown Prince of Iran in 1967 at the time of his father&#x27;s coronation.

Pahlavi is the founder and leader of National Council of Iran, an exiled opposition group, participates in the Iranian democracy movement, and is a prominent critic of Iran&#x27;s Islamic Republic government.

== Early life and education ==

Reza Pahlavi was born in Tehran as the eldest son of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the Shah of Iran and Farah Pahlavi, the Shahbanu of Iran. Pahlavi&#x27;s siblings include his sister Princess Farahnaz Pahlavi (born 1963), brother Prince Ali Reza Pahlavi (1966–2011), and sister Princess Leila Pahlavi (1970–2001), as well as a half-sister, Princess Shahnaz Pahlavi (born 1940).

When he was born, the Shah pardoned 98 political prisoners, and the government declared a 20% reduction in income tax. He studied at the eponymous &quot;Reza Pahlavi School&quot;, a private school located in the royal palace and restricted to the imperial family and court associates. He was trained as a pilot; his first solo flight was at the age of 11, and he obtained his license a year later. He was a supporter of Taj Abadan football club.

As a cadet of the Imperial Iranian Air Force, he was sent to the United States in August 1978 to continue his pilot training. He was one of 43 cadet pilots in the one-year pilot training program at the former Reese Air Force Base, TX, which included flying the Cessna T-37 Tweet and Northrop T-38 Talon. As a result of the Iranian Revolution, he left the base in March 1979, about four months earlier than planned.

Pahlavi began studies at Williams College in September 1979, but dropped out in 1980. He then enrolled at The American University in Cairo as a political science student, but his attendance was irregular. In 1981, it was reported that he had dropped out of the program and continued his studies privately with Iranian professors, with a focus on Persian culture and history, Islamic philosophy, and oil in Iran.

Pahlavi obtained a BSc degree in political science by correspondence from the University of Southern California in 1985. He is fluent in English and French in addition to his native Persian.

==Political activities in exile==

Reza Pahlavi came to Cairo, Egypt, in March 1980 with his family. When his father Mohammad Reza Pahlavi was ill and in the last weeks of his life, media reported that some monarchist elements had advised the Shah to oust Reza in favor of his younger son Ali Reza (who was 13 at the time) and a regency council, suggesting that Reza&#x27;s background, training and interest in public affairs were too limited to become his successor. The Shah was understood to have rejected the idea and abdicated himself in favor of one of his two sons. When the Shah died on 27 July 1980, Farah Pahlavi proclaimed herself as the regent, a title in pretense. On his 20th birthday on 31 October, Reza Pahlavi declared himself to be the new king of Iran, Reza Shah II, and the rightful successor to the throne of Pahlavi dynasty. Immediately afterward a spokesman for the United States Department of State, John Trattner, disassociated the U.S. government from Reza Pahlavi by stating that his government did not intend to support him, assuring that they recognized the Iranian government.

During 1981, Pahlavi remained in the Koubbeh Palace and developed close ties to pro-monarchy groups while facing rejection from other opposition groups, including left-wing dissidents. In March, he issued a statement for the Persian New Year. He urged all opponents of the Iranian government to unite behind him and wage a &quot;national resistance&quot;. Still, he chose to remain silent and made no reaction when President Abolhassan Banisadr was deposed, and the assassination of tens of officials including Chief Justice Mohammad Beheshti took place in June. In August, Pahlavi announced that he had been secretly planning to overthrow the Iranian government, stating, &quot;So far I have been unwilling to unveil the existence of the concerted plans for I do not wish to jeopardize the lives of some of our best children... many of our actions have been unknown to you, but I want to assure you that the necessary steps are being taken in the best orderly way to save Iran&quot;.

In 1982, Yaakov Nimrodi told BBC in a radio interview that along with Adolph Schwimmer and Adnan Khashoggi, he was involved with Pahlavi and Gen. Said Razvani to scheme a coup d&#x27;état and install him in Iran. According to Samuel Segev, the plan had the approval of both the CIA and the Israeli cabinet, but it was abandoned when Menachem Begin resigned in 1983 and the new leadership &quot;thought Israel should not be involved in a new adventure&quot;.

On 1 May 1986, Pahlavi disclosed that he had recently formed a government-in-exile to establish a constitutional monarchy again in Iran.

On his website, Pahlavi has said that the state of Iran should become democratic and secular, and human rights should be respected. Whether the form of government would be that of a constitutional monarchy or a republic, he would like to leave up to the people of Iran.

Pahlavi has used his high profile as an Iranian abroad to campaign for human rights, democracy, and unity among Iranians in and outside Iran. On his website, he calls for a separation of religion and state in Iran and free and fair elections &quot;for all freedom-loving individuals and political ideologies&quot;. He exhorts all groups dedicated to a democratic agenda to work together for a democratic and secular Iranian government.

In February 2011, after violence erupted in Tehran, Pahlavi said that Iran&#x27;s youth were determined to get rid of an authoritarian government tainted by corruption and misrule in the hope of installing a democracy. &quot;Fundamental and necessary change is long overdue for our region, and we have a whole generation of young Egyptians and Iranians not willing to take no for an answer&quot;, he told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. &quot;Democratization is now imperative that cannot be denied. It is only a matter of time before the whole region can transform itself.&quot;

In June 2018, he commented: &quot;I believe Iran must be a secular, parliamentary democracy. The final form has to be decided by the people.&quot; In a presentation at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy in December 2018, Pahlavi called for the non-military support of those in Iran who were trying to replace the Islamist regime with a secular democracy. According to a news report, he was &quot;not openly calling for the restoration of the Peacock Throne ... He casts himself more as a symbol than a politician, but has called himself &#x27;ready to serve my country&#x27;&quot;.

During anti-government demonstrations in Iran in 2022 following the Abadan building collapse, Pahlavi predicted that the Islamic regime would collapse in the near future as events such as the shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, bans on importing foreign COVID-19 vaccines and tests into the country and rising food prices had led to unnecessary deaths and would provoke further anger at government mismanagement from the population. He also urged members of the Iranian armed forces who oppose the Islamic Republic but work for the government to engage in peaceful disruption and called for a coordinated front against the regime. While acknowledging support from Iranian demonstrators chanting for the return of the monarchy, he also stated, &quot;The most important thing I do in response to the Iranian people&#x27;s trust is to reinforce their voices. I don&#x27;t tell them what to do. I&#x27;m not a political leader.&quot;

In a February 2023 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; Pahlavi called on the British and European governments to proscribe the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) arguing such a move would be &quot;pulling out the biggest tooth the regime has.&quot; In the interview, he also argued his belief that the Islamic Republic was more likely to fall in the near future than it had been in previous decades as Iranian reformists had switched tactics to wanting to completely overthrow the regime as opposed to changing it. He acknowledged many Iranian dissidents wanted him to play a central role in creating a new government but reiterated that he would leave it to the people of Iran on whether to restore the throne and that he would not run for political office if the regime fell. Pahlavi also predicted that the greatest challenge for a new secular, liberal democratic Iran would be the question of controlling the military and seeking justice against officials in the regime. He concluded that higher-ranking members of the Islamic regime would face trials for human rights abuses but lower ranking members could be pardoned to allow reintegration into society, citing the Nuremberg trials in which top Nazi officials were prosecuted while lower ranking members were reintegrated back into Germany, and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in South Africa after the end of apartheid as examples to follow.

In March 2023, Pahlavi embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom and gave a speech to the Oxford Union. During the speech, he argued that &quot;secular[ism] is a prerequisite to democracy&quot; and that Islamic regimes fail by not accepting freedom of religion. He called for the right to Internet access to be restored to Iran to help communication between dissident movements and for non-violent tactics to be used in bringing down the Iranian regime. During the speech, a large demonstration took place outside in support of Pahlavi calling for his restoration.

On 17 April 2023, he and his wife Yasmine visited Israel in &quot;an effort to rebuild the historic relations between Iran and Israel.&quot; Upon his arrival to Israel, he visited the Western Wall and Yad Vashem on the occasion of Yom HaShoah, and met with President of Israel Isaac Herzog and Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. He also paid a condolence call to the bereaved Dee family at their home in the West Bank settlement of Efrat on Tuesday, after the deaths of sisters Maia and Rina and their mother Lucy in a deadly terror shooting during the Passover holiday.

===Succession===
Reza Pahlavi II is first in the line of succession to his late father. In contrast, his younger brother Ali-Reza Pahlavi II was second in line until his death by suicide in 2011. Before Reza Pahlavi&#x27;s birth, the presumptive heir was Patrick Ali Pahlavi, the crown prince&#x27;s cousin.

In February 2019, Reza Pahlavi launched the Phoenix Project of Iran initiative. According to the National Interest, this is &quot;designed to bring the various strains of the opposition closer to a common vision for a post-clerical Iran&quot;.

=== Within Iran ===
A report published by the Brookings Institution in 2009 said that Pahlavi lacked an organized following within Iran since there was no serious monarchist movement in Iran itself. The report described Pahlavi as having &quot;little in common with the intellectuals and students who make up the core of the reform movement&quot;.

During 2017–18 Iranian protests, some videos on social media showed demonstrators chanting slogans in favor of Pahlavi&#x27;s grandfather and calling for his return. On many occasions the videos indicated the royalist slogans prompt others in the crowd to shout the slogans down.

In January 2023, New York-based Iranian scholar and writer Arash Azizi noted that among younger Iranians on social media and at public demonstrations support for Pahlavi has become more visible and argued &quot;To any fair observer of Iran, Pahlavi has a certain degree of support in Iranian society, although it is hard to discern just how wide this support is.&quot; He also noted that a number of Iranian dissident activists and celebrities including Dariush Eghbali (who had been imprisoned under the Shah&#x27;s rule), actress Shohreh Aghdashloo, actor Hamid Farrokhnezhad and Olympian Kimia Alizadeh have come out in support of Pahlavi being a figurehead to unite anti-regime movements. Tehran based intellectual Khashayar Dayhimi opined &quot;I believe that, if there was a referendum today and Reza Pahlavi was on the ballot, he&#x27;d easily win because people don&#x27;t know anyone other than him.&quot;

=== Among Iranian expatriates ===
Pahlavi enjoys wide popularity with the older generation of Iranian expatriates that left Iran during the 1979 revolution and with some people in Iran. In 2006, Connie Bruck of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that Los Angeles is home to about 600,000 Iranian expatriates, and said it was a monarchist stronghold.

A 2013 survey of Iranian-Americans conducted by George Mason University&#x27;s Center for Social Science Research found that 85% of respondents did not support any Iranian opposition groups or figures. Of the remaining 15% who expressed support, 20% backed him.

=== Support during the Mahsa Amini protests ===

In a recent attempt in 2023 to garner support for Reza Pahlavi as a representative for transition, a petition was created on the platform Change.org that has amassed over 460,000 signatures.

Reza Pahlavi asked Iranians worldwide to protest against the Islamic Republic on its 44th anniversary, February 11, 2023. As a result, people rallied in multiple cities in the US, Europe, Australia, and Canada. Reza Pahlavi himself participated in LA rally where a crowd of more than 80,000 showed up.

==== July 2024 speech ====
In July 2024, Pahlavi was invited to speak at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, D.C. In his speech, Pahlavi blamed the Iranian regime for the spread of radical Islam to other nations in the Middle East and the West following the revolution and promised that Iranians will take Iran back in the near future. He also argued that Masoud Pezeshkian was not a &quot;moderate&quot; politician due to his friendship with Hezbollah. He warned the United States not to launch a military campaign against the regime, arguing &quot;the problem that began in Iran must be ended in Iran&quot; and concluded &quot;the soon to be free Iran, doesn&#x27;t seek your patronage. It seeks your partnership. It doesn&#x27;t seek your funding. It seeks your friendship.”

In an essay for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, he called for the IRGC to be designated terror group by British government for its funding of Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis, as well as their suppression of Zan Zendegi Azadi.

=== 2024-2025 ===

In November 2024 Pahlavi called on Iranians to take the country back, adding that he was ready to lead any interim rule. He said in a Newsmax interview that internal force will topple the regime.

In January and February 2025 he adviced Trump not to make a nuclear peace agreement with Iranian regime.

==== Munich Conference in Bahman 1403 and the Selection of Reza Pahlavi as Leader of the Transitional Period ====
In February 2025, the Munich Security Conference invited Prince Reza Pahlavi to attend the event, but following intense pressure from the Islamic Republic, the invitation was withdrawn. After a period, he was invited once again to participate in the conference, only for that invitation to be cancelled once more under pressure from the Islamic Republic which feared the popularity and influence of Prince Pahlavi. Prince Pahlavi described this decision as &quot;a betrayal of the Iranian people and the democratic values of Germany&quot; and stated, &quot;The German government has not only silenced the voice of the Iranian people, but has also directly aligned itself with the Islamic Republic&quot;.

Despite these obstacles, Prince Reza Pahlavi held a convergence meeting in Munich with the participation of all Iranian opposition organizations, emphasizing, &quot;Our goal today is solely the salvation of Iran, and in the future our mission is to hold free elections in Iran&quot;. He added that “the collapse within the regime has begun and must be broadened,&quot; and stressed, &quot;Our goal is not to create new organizations, but rather to establish a mechanism for cooperation among different groups&quot;. He further emphasized, &quot;Our future duty is to establish in the Constituent Assembly a democratic path based on the people&#x27;s vote—and in contrast to the practices of 1978—wherein all possible options regarding the content and final form of Iran&#x27;s new system are discussed transparently. The Constituent Assembly project will soon be presented to the people to outline how a national referendum via ballot boxes will be conducted for a democratic future and a secular system&quot;.

At a meeting of all Iranian opposition currents held in Munich, it was agreed that Prince Reza Pahlavi should assume the role of leader of the transitional period. The statement further emphasized his role as &quot;the leader of the national revolution and transitional period until the election of the first parliament and the establishment of a democratic government through free elections,&quot; declaring: &quot;Based on the will of the Iranian nation—as reflected in the slogans and messages of recent years—we consider Prince Reza Pahlavi to be the leader of the national revolution and transitional period until the formation of the first national assembly and the commencement of a democratic government through free elections, and we will support him with all our might&quot;.

At the same time, a group of Iranians organized a protest rally on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. In addition to expressing support for Prince Reza Pahlavi, they protested against the conciliatory policies of the European Union, particularly those of the German government, toward the Islamic Republic.

Five Strategies for Overthrowing the Islamic Republic

Prince Reza Pahlavi, at the Geneva Human Rights Meeting on February 20th, presented five key strategies for overthrowing the Islamic Republic and rebuilding Iran. These strategies include: mobilizing grassroots networks within the country; uniting the Iranian diaspora; exerting maximum pressure on the governments of the G20 to support the Iranian people; creating a rift within the regime’s structure to encourage defections; and preparing for political stabilization and the holding of democratic elections. He emphasized that these measures are aimed at reclaiming a country that has been plundered by the regime.

Regarding the role of women, Prince Pahlavi recalled that the very first action taken by Ruhollah Khomeini was the abrogation of the Family Protection Law, and that since then the Islamic Republic has waged a war against women. He stated: &quot;Let me be clear; Iranian women are not merely fighting against the compulsory hijab in Iran. Their struggle is not for a mere piece of cloth, but for reclaiming equality and their country&quot;. He also cited the courage of women such as Fatemeh Sepehri, Nasrin Shakeri, and Nahid Shirpishe, who continue to resist despite imprisonment and persecution.

Prince Pahlavi also addressed the environmental destruction perpetrated by the Islamic Republic, noting the drying up of Lake Urmia and rivers such as the Zayandeh Rud. He remarked: &quot;The air pollution in Tehran and Ahvaz is among the worst in the world. Pollution in Iran often reaches toxic levels, forcing schools and businesses to close, and those who dare to speak out—such as environmental activists like Kavous Seyed Amami—are imprisoned or killed&quot;. He denounced these actions as a crime against both the environment and the people of Iran.

In his speech, Prince Reza Pahlavi addressed the economic and social crises resulting from the policies of the Islamic Republic. He stressed that &quot;in a country that should be one of the wealthiest in the world, a growing number of my compatriots cannot even afford to buy bread, let alone meat&quot;, drawing attention to the dire living conditions of the populace. Furthermore, he pointed to the energy crisis in Iran and the frequent outages of gas and electricity in the country, stating: &quot;A country sitting on the world&#x27;s second largest gas reserves is experiencing widespread power outages. Patients die in hospitals, businesses go bankrupt, and families are left in darkness&quot;.

==== Interview to The Daily Telegraph ====
In February 23, in an interview to the Daily Telegraph, Pahlavi called on Europe and Americans to prepare for impending collapse of regime in Tehran. In this interview, The Daily Telegraph described the support for Pahlavi as &quot;even critics acknowledge Pahlavi at least has a plan for reform, and a rare degree of public recognition both inside and outside Iran&quot;.
==Foreign support==
Bob Woodward wrote in 1986 that the Reagan administration authorized the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to support and fund Iranian exiles, including Pahlavi. The agency transmitted his 11-minute speech during which he vowed &quot;I will return&quot; to Iranian television by pirating its frequency. The Tower Commission report, published in 1987, also acknowledged that the CIA was behind this event while a group in Paris calling itself &#x27;Flag of Freedom&#x27; had taken responsibility for the act in September 1986.

James Mann wrote in February 1989 that when he asked the CIA about whether they helped Pahlavi, they refused to comment, and a spokesperson of the agency told him, &quot;We would not confirm nor deny an intelligence matter&quot;.

In 2006, Connie Bruck of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote that &quot;Pahlavi had CIA funding for several years in the eighties, but it ended after the Iran-Contra scandal&quot;. Andrew Friedman of Haverford College states that Pahlavi began cooperation with the CIA after he met director William J. Casey and received a monthly stipend, citing Pahlavi&#x27;s financial advisor and other observers. Friedman also connects his residence in Great Falls, Virginia to its proximity to George Bush Center for Intelligence, headquarters of the service.

In 2009, Pahlavi denied receiving U.S. government or foreign aid in an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Pahlavi said &quot;No, no. I don&#x27;t rely on any sources other than my own compatriots&quot; and denied allegations of working with the CIA, calling the allegations &quot;absolutely and unequivocally false&quot;. However, in 2017 he told Jon Gambrell of the Associated Press: &quot;My focus right now is on liberating Iran, and I will find any means that I can, without compromising the national interests and independence, with anyone who is willing to give us a hand, whether it is the U.S. or the Saudis or the Israelis or whomever it is.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and marriage ===
According to a &quot;People&quot; article published in 1978, Pahlavi dated a &quot;blond, blue-eyed Swedish model he met in Rome&quot;. The same publication also reported that he lived with his girlfriend in Lubbock, Texas. As of 1980, he had an Egyptian girlfriend who was a student of The American University in Cairo, reportedly &quot;closely guarded&quot; by bodyguards.

Pahlavi began a relationship with Yasmine Etemad-Amini in 1985, and a year later married her, then aged 17, at 25. They married on June 12, 1986 in Greenwich, Connecticut. The couple have three daughters: Noor (born 3 April 1992), Iman (born 12 September 1993), and Farah (born 17 January 2004).

In 2004, Pahlavi was named the &quot;unofficial godfather&quot; of Princess Louise of Belgium, the eighth granddaughter of King Albert II of the Belgians.

=== Hobbies ===
Pahlavi was a keen football player and spectator. He was a fan of the capital&#x27;s football club Esteghlal, then known as &quot;Taj&quot; (), and his support was even televised by the National Iranian Radio and Television. The club performed in annual rallies organized on his birthday, identifying the club with the Pahlavi regime.

In 1981, UPI reported that Pahlavi attended the elite Gueziro Club in Cairo to watch tennis and was occasionally seen in discotheques at hotels in the vicinity of the Nile.

=== Religious beliefs ===
When interviewed about religion, Pahlavi said, &quot;That&#x27;s a private matter, but if you must know, I am, of course, by education and conviction, a Shia Muslim. I am very much a man of faith.&quot; Iranian writer Reza Bayegan also notes that Crown Prince Reza is alleged &quot;deeply attached&quot; to his Muslim faith. He has performed the Hajj (pilgrimage) to Mecca.

==Financial and legal issues==
=== Occupation ===
In 1989, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that Pahlavi was unemployed. Asked about his sources of income, he replied that he had been financially supported by &quot;friends and family&quot; in the past seven years. In 2017, he told the Associated Press that since 1979 he had had no &quot;side occupation&quot; (about political activities), adding that his money came from his family and &quot;many Iranians who have supported the cause&quot;. According to a December 2018 news report by &quot;Politico&quot;, &quot;he is thought to live mainly on what&#x27;s left of his family wealth, his only full-time job being speaking out about Iran&quot;.

=== &quot;Shahbazi v. Pahlavi&quot; ===
In 1990, Ali Haydar Shahbazi, a former Imperial Guard member who worked for Pahlavi as a longtime bodyguard, filed a lawsuit in the district court of Alexandria, Virginia, accusing Pahlavi of breaching Iranian tradition by breaking his pledge to take care of him financially. Shahbazi, then aged 58, said in the court he abandoned more than $400,000 in property in Iran because Pahlavi assured him &quot;I&#x27;m going to pay your expenses and everything. I&#x27;m going to take care of you better than my father [did]&quot; when he was hired, and then fired him with a handshake and $9,000 in 1989. Shahbazi asked compensation for the $30,000 in taxes and penalties as well as an undetermined amount of money for his retirement. Pahlavi&#x27;s attorney dismissed the claim, saying that Shahbazi has received gifts worth several thousand dollars and was allowed to live luxuriously in Pahlavi&#x27;s house in Great Falls, Virginia, adding that the servant was fired because his client ran out of money. Pahlavi agreed that Shahbazi was a loyal friend but he offered support as long as he could. He also told the judge, &quot;I was not involved in the day-to-day handling of my financial affairs&quot;.

In 1991, District Judge Albert Vickers Bryan Jr. argued that Pahlavi &quot;had little knowledge of how his estate&#x27;s money was spent and could not be held personally accountable for employment agreements with servants&quot;, declaring the case dismissed. According to media reports, Pahlavi began to cry in the court when the judge threw out the case.

=== &quot;Ansari v. Pahlavi&quot; ===
In 1990, Pahlavi and Ahmad Ali Massoud Ansari, his close aide and financial adviser, filed lawsuits against each other. Pahlavi accused Ansari of embezzlement amounting $24 million, while Ansari claimed $1.7 million lien against Pahlavi. During the trial, Pahlavi&#x27;s attorney told the court &quot;[d]ue to the demands of his political responsibilities and his lack of experience in financial matters, Pahlavi had to trust completely in Ansari for the management of his funds... over the years, no one supplanted Ansari in any way in Pahlavi&#x27;s trust. Conversely, no one betrayed Pahlavi&#x27;s trust any more than Ansari&quot;, going further to accuse Ansari as &quot;an agent&quot; for the Islamic Republic of Iran. Ansari denied the accusations and blamed Pahlavi for squandering the money with his extravagance, stating he faithfully carried out orders that Pahlavi was aware of.

The court asked Ansari to provide a complete accounting of his money handling, but he alleged that the documents had been destroyed to prevent a potential seizure. In 1996, the court ruled that Ansari should repay $7.3 million to Pahlavi and fined him an additional $2 million.

== Television network ==
In November 2014, Pahlavi founded his own television and radio network called Ofogh Iran; in July 2017 it was reported that the Ofogh Iran International Media telethon no longer belonged to Pahlavi.

<text>Nyngan () is a town in the centre of New South Wales, Australia, in the Bogan Shire local government area within the Orana Region of central New South Wales. At the 2016 census, Nyngan had a population of 1,988 people. Nyngan is situated on the Bogan River between Narromine and Bourke, on the junction of the Mitchell Highway and Barrier Highway, south of Charleville and north-west of Sydney by road. The Barrier Highway starts at Nyngan, and runs west to Cobar and on through Wilcannia and Broken Hill into South Australia.

Nyngan Airport is a small airport just north of the town centre. Nyngan also lies on the Main Western railway line of New South Wales but is no longer served by passenger trains. The line remains open to freight traffic.

About south of the town, a cairn was erected in 1988 marking the centre of NSW.

==History==
The district was originally inhabited by the Wangaibon Peoples. Thomas Mitchell explored the Bogan River in 1835, camping on the future townsite. He recorded the local Aboriginal word &quot;nyingan&quot;, said to mean &#x27;long pond of water&#x27;, though other meanings have been put forward, such as mussel or crayfish. Squatters had settled in Mitchell&#x27;s wake before he had begun his return journey. The town flourished after completion of the railway line in 1883.

The little town of Canonba, 25 kilometres to the north-east on Duck Creek, is part of the history of Nyngan. From the early 1840s until the middle &#x27;eighties, it grew and flourished, servicing Canonba Station and other properties, and Cobb and Co. travellers. In the early 1880s there were about four hotels, three or four banks, various stores and tradesmen, a police station, a telegraph and money-order office, and representatives of churches. The Western Railway by-passed Canonba, and where it crossed the Bogan was Nyngan. The Canonba populace, goods and public institutions then all moved to Nyngan. By 1890 it was practically empty.

The Municipality of Nyngan was proclaimed on 17 February 1891 with Nyngan having a population of 1355.

===The 1990 Nyngan flood===
In April 1990, unusually heavy rains (which had caused flooding in Charleville, Queensland with total damages of up to $300 million) caused major flooding in the town, despite a massive effort by local people to raise the levee walls using sandbags. With the town almost completely flooded, all the residents had to be evacuated by helicopter from the railway station, the highest point of the town, which was not flooded. Air Force helicopters, TV news helicopters and private helicopters all co-operated in the airlift. The total damage amounted to $50 million. The airlift is commemorated by an Army helicopter placed outside of the Nyngan Railway Station. The railway station now houses a museum which includes exhibits relating to the 1990 flood. (The station had not been regularly used for train passengers since about 1980; the railway line to Bourke has been out of use since 17 May 1989 but the Cobar line remains open to carry ore and wheat).

== Climate ==
Nyngan experiences a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot;), with long, very hot summers and short, cool winters, with a slight summer peak in rainfall mainly owed to severe thunderstorms. Seasonal range is considerable in both maximum and minimum temperatures. 


== Heritage listings ==
Nyngan has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Cemetery Road: Chinese Graves and Burner at Nyngan Cemetery
* 77–79 Cobar Street: Nyngan Court House

==Solar power==

Approximately west of the town is one of Australia&#x27;s largest photovoltaic power stations, with 1.36 million solar panels. It was the largest solar PV plant in Australia when launched in July 2016. It complements another plant at Broken Hill, which was expected to be fully operational by the end of 2015, for a combined capacity of .

== Media ==
The town is serviced by Outback Radio 2WEB on 100.7 MHz.

<text>Bogan River, a perennial river that is part of the Macquarie–Barwon catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the central west and Orana regions of New South Wales, Australia.

From its origin near Parkes, the Bogan River flows for about in length and flows into the Little Bogan River to form the Darling River, near Bourke.

The name Bogan is supposedly an Australian Aboriginal (Wiradjuri or Ngiyambaa) term meaning &#x27;the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe&#x27;; this may be in reference to the Wiradjuri people of the Bulgandramine Aboriginal Mission, whose word for &quot;leader&quot; is “Balgabalgar”. The word is also a Gaelic term meaning bog.

==Geography==
From the foothills of the Herveys Range, the Bogan River rises to the west of the headwaters of the Little River at Cooks Myalls, near Goonumbla, north-west of Parkes. The river flows in a generally north-north-westerly direction past Tottenham, Peak Hill and through Nyngan. East of Bourke, the Bogan River joins with the Little Bogan River to form the Darling River. The Bogan River has over twenty tributaries. The main tributaries to the west are Bullock, Bulbodney, Pangee and Whitbarrow Creeks. The eastern catchment between the Bogan and Macquarie Rivers is ill-defined and has only one major tributary, Mulla Cowal. Other sources have claimed that Bugwah Cowal, and Burrill, Duck and Gunningbar Creeks are important tributaries.

Unlike the other main rivers of inland New South Wales, the Bogan does not rise in the well-watered highland areas, so its flow is low and erratic and not much use for irrigation.

Major weirs along the watercourse are at Muddal Weir, located west of Peak Hill; the Nyngan Weir, located north of Nyngan; and Gongolgon Weir, where the mean daily flow exceeds .

The Kamilaroi Highway crosses the Bogan River east of Bourke.

==History==

===Aboriginal history===
A number of Aboriginal peoples lived in the lands surrounding the Bogan River for many thousands of years. In the area surrounding Peak Hill, the indigenous inhabitants of the area were the Wiradjuri clan. In the area surrounding Nyngan, the Ngiyambaa Aboriginal people were the principal custodians of the land.

===Late modern history===
The river was crossed by John Oxley in 1817, but was named by Charles Sturt in his 1828-9 expedition as New Years Creek on 1 January 1829. It was also called the Bogan River prior to Major Sir Thomas Mitchell reaching here in 1835.

The Albert Priest Channel was built in 1941 and this assists the water supplies of Nyngan and Cobar with Macquarie River water. It is about 60 km long, extending from Gunningbar Creek near Warren to the Bogan River upstream of Nyngan. A pipeline takes water from Nyngan to Cobar.

In April 1990, major flooding occurred along the river and in Nyngan, and despite a massive effort by local people to build levee walls using sandbags, 2,500 people had to be evacuated from the town. The floods caused A$50 million damage. Other significant flooding of the Bogan River occurred in 1928, 1950, 1989 and other years. In 1989 the significant flooding was downstream of Nyngan. https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/63179773

<doc id="613955" wikidata="Q2107368" url="?curid=613955" title="Forbes, New South Wales">
<text>Forbes is a town in the Central West region of New South Wales, Australia, located on the Newell Highway between Parkes and West Wyalong. According to the , Forbes has a population of 9, 319. Forbes is probably named after Sir Francis Forbes, first Chief Justice of NSW.

Located on the banks of the Lachlan River, Forbes is above sea-level and about west of Sydney. The district is a cropping area where wheat and similar crops are grown. Nearby towns and villages include Calarie, Parkes, Bedgerebong, Bundabarrah, Corradgery, Daroobalgie, Eugowra, Ooma North and Paytens Bridge. Forbes is subject to a pattern of flooding, generally occurring to a significant level once every seven years, including 2016 and 2022.

==History==
The area was home to the Wiradjuri people before non-indigenous settlement. John Oxley passed through in 1817 during one of the first inland expeditions. Oxley named the site Camp Hill. He was unimpressed with the clay soil, poor timber and swamps and he concluded, &quot;it is impossible to imagine a worse country&quot;. The first settlers moved into the district in 1834.

Gold was discovered by Harry Stephan, also known as &quot;German Harry&quot;, in June 1861. Initially about 30,000 people moved to the goldfields, but by 1863 this had declined to about 3,500 because of the difficult mining conditions. The Post Office was opened on 1 December 1861 and given the name Black Ridge in response to the demand for postal services by those involved with the gold rush along the Lachlan River. That name was changed before opening. The Forbes Telegraph Office opened on 27 October 1862 after a telegraph line had been constructed from Orange. The two offices merged on 1 January 1870. On opening day of the Telegraph Office in 1862, the results of three days of races at the Lachlan Gold Fields were telegraphed to Bathurst.

The goldfields were originally named &quot;Black Ridge&quot;, and the name &quot;Forbes&quot; celebrating Sir Francis Forbes was declared from Sydney as the result of a possible government administrative error. It is said that the name was meant for the town now known as &quot;Hill End&quot; between Orange and Mudgee, where gold was discovered around a similar time. Gold was initially found in the area known as Halpin&#x27;s Flat. The Albion Hotel, once a Cobb and Co. stage coach stop, had tunnels situated underneath which were used during the gold rush to convey gold and money to and from the banks to minimise the chance of theft. The Albion Hotel burnt down on 10 February 2009, losing years worth of history and memorabilia.

One of Australia&#x27;s most renowned bushrangers, Ben Hall, was shot dead in an early morning police ambush about to the north-west of Forbes on 5 May 1865. Hall and his gang were famous for stealing of gold and £3,700 from the nearby town of Eugowra in 1862. He is buried in Forbes Cemetery.

Kate Kelly, the sister of bushranger Ned Kelly, lived in the town. She drowned in Lake Forbes while saving an Aboriginal child during a flood in 1898 and was found in a lagoon of the Lachlan River, just outside Forbes. She is buried in Forbes Cemetery.

== Heritage listings ==

Forbes&#x27; most recent major flood was in late September 2016 after heavy rain fell on much of inland NSW; as the Bureau of Meteorology declared 2016 as the third-wettest winter on record. Unseasonal heavy rainfall in most of the state, centred on the catchment area of the upper Lachlan during autumn and winter 2016, resulted in Wyangala Dam water storage levels increasing from 38 per cent to 90 per cent. By early August, the Bureau of Meteorology had issued flood warnings for the Orara, Macquarie, Bogan and Lachlan rivers. In late August, Water NSW began releasing up to per day from Wyangala Dam ahead of expected daily rainfall in the range of in the dam&#x27;s catchment area. Moderate to major flooding first hit Forbes and in early September, and by mid-September predictions were for widespread flooding across most of inland New South Wales. By late September, flooding had peaked in Forbes at , with 1,000 people evacuated, as the Newell Highway was cut north and south of Forbes&#x27; central business district. Forbes was declared a natural disaster zone after flash flooding occurred, resulting in some residents being without homes. Back up support was provided by the State Emergency Service and the Australian Defence Force. As the Lachlan flowed into the Murrumbidgee River, major flooding occurred downriver during late October and early November at and .

<text>BLRT Western Shipyard () is a shipyard in Klaipėda, Lithuania. The company belongs to the Estonian company BLRT Grupp and provides shipbuilding and repair services in the Baltic region.

==History==
In 1952, during the Soviet occupation, a new shipyard called (Baltija Shipbuilding Yard) was established. In 1969, another shipyard called (Western Ship Repair Factory) was built. Following the restoration of independence, the government of Lithuania privatized the shipyards. In 1997, &quot;Baltijos laivų statykla&quot; was sold to a Danish company Odense Steel Shipyard, while in 2001 &quot;Vakarų laivų remonto gamykla&quot; was sold to the Estonian company BLRT Grupp. In 2010, the &quot;Baltijos laivų statykla&quot; was taken over by the BLRT Grupp, thus merging both shipyards under the Western Baltija Shipbuilding within the Western Shipyard Group.

==Activities==
The main activities of the company are shipbuilding, ship repair and conversion, complex ship design and engineering as well as metal construction.

In 2011, the shipyard built the largest LNG-powered Norwegian ferry &quot;MF Boknafjord&quot;.

In June 2020, the largest floating dock (235 m long and 45 m wide, with lifting capacity of 33,000 tons) in the Baltic States was installed in the shipyard.

<doc id="613958" wikidata="Q794130" url="?curid=613958" title="Grassholm">
<text>Grassholm ( or ) or Grassholm Island is a small uninhabited island situated off the southwestern Pembrokeshire coast in Wales, lying west of Skomer, in the community of Marloes and St Brides. It is the westernmost point in Wales other than the isolated rocks on which the Smalls Lighthouse stands. Grassholm is known for its huge colony of northern gannets; the island has been owned since 1947 by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is one of its oldest reserves. It reaches .

Grassholm National Nature Reserve is the third most important site for gannets in the world, after two sites in Scotland: St Kilda and Bass Rock. It serves as a breeding site for 39,000 pairs of the birds, and supports around 10 per cent of the world population. The turbulent sea around Grassholm is a good feeding area for porpoises and bottlenose dolphins.

The island has a significant problem with marine plastic, brought to the island by breeding gannets, as nesting material which the birds have mistaken for seaweed floating in the surrounding waters. The problem has been ongoing through twelve years of RSPB conservation to 2017, and surveys have indicated that 80% of nests contain waste plastics.

Boats sail to Grassholm from St Davids Lifeboat Station and Martin&#x27;s Haven on the mainland, but members of the public are not permitted to land.

Geologically, the island is largely formed from keratophyre, though the northwest coast and the islet of West Tump are formed from basalt. A couple of NE-SW aligned faults cross the island. Raised beaches are present in places.

==The entertaining of the noble head==

Grassholm has been identified with &quot;Gwales&quot;, an island in the medieval Welsh story (Branwen the daughter of Llŷr), one of the Four Branches of the Mabinogi. Gwales is the site of a fabulous castle where the severed head of Brân the Blessed is kept miraculously alive for eighty years while his companions feast in blissful forgetfulness, until the opening of a forbidden door that faces Cornwall recalls them to their sorrow and the need to bury the head at the White Mount (the Tower of London). &quot;Brân&quot; is the Welsh for &#x27;raven&#x27;, which has a legendary connection with the Tower of London.

==Shipwreck==

On 15 July 1945, the cargo ship ran aground on Grassholm and sank. Nine crew were rescued by the Angle Lifeboat.

<doc id="613960" wikidata="Q2915319" url="?curid=613960" title="FA Inter-League Cup">
<text>The FA Inter-League Cup (formerly known as the FA National League System Cup or FA NLS Cup) is a football competition run by The Football Association. It was created in the 2003–04 season to provide an English representative in the UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup.

==History==
In previous Regions&#x27; Cups, the FA had nominated a team to take part; in the 2002–03 season it was a Kent County League XI. UEFA decreed that in the future all Regions&#x27; Cup entrants must have won a national competition, and so the NLS Cup was formed.

The cup is contested by representative sides from leagues at Step 7 of the National League System, with a few other leagues permitted by the FA. That is roughly at the county level or eleventh overall tier of the English football league system. The first final was held on 8 May 2004, and was won by the Mid Cheshire League, who beat the Cambridgeshire County League 2–0.

The second final was held on 7 May 2006 at Cambridge United&#x27;s Abbey Stadium, and saw the Cambridgeshire County League and Isle of Man Football League compete. The Isle of Man comfortably won the fixture with four goals in the second half and claimed the trophy with a final score of 4–0. The team travelled to the Czech Republic in April 2007 for the Intermediary Round of the UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup. After a 1–2 defeat to the Bratislava team (Slovakia) a 3–2 win over the hosting Hradec Králové team left the side with a chance of qualifying for the finals. Unfortunately a 0–1 loss to Northern Ireland&#x27;s Eastern Region ended their hopes.

The 2008 final was held at Coventry City&#x27;s Ricoh Arena on Saturday 3 May. The Southern Amateur League won the competition at the first attempt after winning a penalty shoot-out 4–2 following a 1–1 draw. The SAL team travelled to Turin in October 2008 for the Intermediary Round of the UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup where they took on representatives from Italy, Scotland and the Republic of Ireland. The team finished second on goal difference, having not conceded any goals in their 3 group matches.

The 2010 final was held at The Track in Saint Sampson, Guernsey on 1 May 2010. The home side, the Guernsey Senior County League, defeated the Liverpool County Premier League 5–2. It was announced in November 2010 that the competition would be renamed from the &quot;FA National League System Cup&quot; to its present name.

The 2018 final was between York Football League and North Riding Football League on Sunday 6 May at the home of Sheffield United - Bramall Lane. North Riding Football League won 4-2.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 final was postponed. The final was between Jersey Football Combination and West Cheshire League on Monday 10 May 2021 at St George&#x27;s Park National Football Centre. Jersey Football Combination won 5-1. This qualified Jersey for the 2023 UEFA Regions&#x27; Cup. 

The competition returned in 2024, with the final taking place on Sunday 5th May 2024 between the Arthurian League and West Yorkshire Association Football League at Lincoln City FC&#x27;s Sincil Bank Stadium.

<text>Love bombing is an attempt to influence a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and for either positive or negative purposes. Psychologists have identified love bombing as a possible part of a cycle of abuse and have warned against it. It has also been described as psychological manipulation in order to create a feeling of unity within a group against a society perceived as hostile. In 2011, clinical psychologist Oliver James advocated love bombing in his book &quot;Love Bombing: Reset Your Child&#x27;s Emotional Thermostat&quot;, as a means for parents to rectify emotional problems in their children.

==Definition and analysis==
The expression &quot;love bombing&quot; was coined by members of the Unification Church of the United States during the 1970s and was also used by members of the Family International. Psychology professor Margaret Singer reported on the concept. In her 1996 book, &quot;Cults in Our Midst,&quot; she writes:

==Abusive relationships==
Modern social media can intensify the effect of love bombing since it gives the abuser nearly constant contact and communication with the victim. One of the signs of love bombing in the start of a relationship is intense attention during a short period of time and pressure for very rapid commitment.

Psychiatrist Dale Archer identifies the phases of love bombing with the acronym IDD: &quot;Intense Idealization, Devaluation, Discard (Repeat)&quot;, and the process of identifying this behavior pattern as SLL: &quot;Stop, Look, and Listen&quot;, after which breaking off contact with the abuser can become more possible by also seeking support from family and friends.

Another sign of love bombing is being intensely showered with affection, gifts, and promises for the future with the predator so that the victim feels or is made to believe that all this is a sign of &quot;love at first sight&quot;. Since such signs of affection and affirmation may meet felt needs and not look harmful at the surface, the excitement of such a new relationship often does not appear as cause for alarm. However, after the initial excitement, when the victim shows interest or care about anything beyond their new partner, the manipulator may show anger or passive-aggressive behavior, or accuse the victims of selfishness. If the victim does not comply with demands, the devaluation stage begins: the abuser withdraws all affection or positive reinforcement and instead punishes the victim with whatever they feel is appropriate—shouting, beratement, mind games, silent treatment, or even physical abuse.

The expression has been used to describe the tactics used by pimps and gang members to control their victims.

==Benign occurrences==
Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse. Archer explains: 

British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, &quot;dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish.&quot; In 2011 Heidi Scrimgeour, a reporter for &quot;The Daily Express&quot;, tried the technique with her son and reported:

<doc id="613966" wikidata="Q1104557" url="?curid=613966" title="Cobb Highway">
<text>Cobb Highway is a state highway in the western Riverina and the far western regions of New South Wales, with a short section in Victoria, Australia, designated part of route B75.

Initially an amalgam of stock routes, the highway extends from the Victorian border north across central New South Wales to Wilcannia, and was named in honour of the Cobb and Co stagecoach company. The highway follows an old coach route through the Riverina, connecting the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Lachlan rivers, and across the intervening plains to the Darling River at Wilcannia. Cobb Highway also connects the Barrier, Mid-Western, Sturt, and Riverina highways.

==Route==
From north to south, Cobb Highway begins at its junction with Barrier Highway near Wilcannia, and runs south through the townships of , , and Deniliquin. Its southern terminus is in Echuca, Victoria, at a roundabout located approximately southwest of where the highway crosses the New South Wales–Victoria border at the Murray River and continues south as Northern Highway, also designated route B75.

The highway travels through diverse changes in scenery, from the Murray River, enclosed farming land in the Riverina, to open grazing land and semi-desert towards the middle and northern sections.

The speed limit is posted at , except for three sections where the limit is : north of Deniliquin until Hay, Hay until a few kilometres north of Booligal, and from just south of to Ivanhoe. It is a sealed single carriageway for its entire length.

==History==
The passing of the &quot;Main Roads Act of 1924&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales provided for the declaration of Main Roads, roads partially funded by the State government through the Main Roads Board (MRB). Main Road No. 60 was declared along this road on 8 August 1928, from the bridge over the Murray River at Moama, via Deniliquin and Hay to the intersection with Mid-Western Highway at Booligal; with the passing of the &quot;Main Roads (Amendment) Act of 1929&quot; to provide for additional declarations of State Highways and Trunk Roads, this was amended to Trunk Road 60 on 8 April 1929. When Mid-Western Highway was re-routed to run via Hay instead of Booligal on 24 September 1929, the declaration remained unchanged.

The Department of Main Roads, which had succeeded the MRB in 1932, declared State Highway 21 on 16 March 1938, from the state border with Victoria on the Murray River at Moama via Deniliquin to the intersection with Sturt Highway near Hay, then from the intersection with Mid-Western Highway in Hay, via Booligal to the intersection with Barrier Highway south of Wilcannia, then from Wilcannia via White Cliffs, Cobham Lake, Milparkinka and Tibooburra to the state border with Queensland at Olive Downs, subsuming Trunk Road 60. This was altered to run continuously through Hay, subsuming the small portion of Mid-Western Highway previously terminating at the intersection with Sturt Highway, on 12 January 1944; Mid-Western Highway was re-declared to terminate at the intersection with State Highway 21 in Hay as a result. With the declaration of State Highway 22 (later Silver City Highway) subsuming the alignment between Cobham Lake and the state border with Queensland on 24 January 1945, its northern end was truncated to end at the intersection with Barrier Highway south of Wilcannia; the former alignment between Wilcannia via White Cliffs to Kayrunnera was declared as Main Road 435.

State Highway 21 was named Cobb Highway on 23 April 1947, in honour of Cobb and Co, a company which ran a network of stagecoaches in inland Australia in the latter half of the 19th century and early in the 20th century.

The passing of the &quot;Roads Act of 1993&quot; through the Parliament of New South Wales updated road classifications and the way they could be declared within New South Wales. Under this act, Cobb Highway today retains its declaration as Highway 21, from the state border with Victoria at Moama via Deniliquin, Hay, Booligal and Ivanhoe to the intersection with Barrier Highway south of Wilcannia.

Cobb Highway was signed National Route 75 across its entire length in 1955. With the conversion to the newer alphanumeric system in 2013, this was replaced with route B75.

Cobb Highway is part of a significant travelling stock routes network in New South Wales. The highway is the focus of a major tourism initiative entitled &quot;The Long Paddock&quot;, developed by the shires along the route (Murray, Deniliquin, Conargo, Hay and Central Darling). &quot;The Long Paddock&quot; project aims to develop sustainable communities along the Cobb Highway through the development of a dynamic cultural heritage touring route. The project uses the consistent theme of transportation, involving elements of history, creative interpretation and local environment, to link the communities along the highway.

===Upgrades===
====Bridges====
In May 1969 a bridge over the Edward River at Deniliquin was constructed (replacing a timber bridge built in 1895). In June 1973 a bridge over Murrumbidgee River at Hay was built (replacing the 1874 opening bridge).

A project to build an extra bridge over the Murray River linking Echuca and Moama commenced in late 2017 and concluded with its opening on 11 April 2022. The project had a total cost of $323.7 million, and was jointly funded by the Australian, Victorian and NSW governments.

====Sealing====
In 2011, work began to seal the of the highway that remained unsealed. Alongside concurrent works on the Silver City Highway, this was done as part of a $195 million project by the NSW Government to complete the sealing of the state&#x27;s highway network. An official opening ceremony was held in November 2023 at the final section of highway to be sealed, near Halfway Tree between Wilcannia and Ivanhoe.

<doc id="613971" wikidata="Q5364701" url="?curid=613971" title="Ellemann-Jensen doctrine">
<text>The Ellemann-Jensen doctrine is a set of principles in international relations aimed at increasing the global influence of smaller nations. The doctrine is not a written document but rather an approach inspired by the 1982–1993 tenure of Danish former Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. He promoted the idea that a small country can gain influence by supporting larger ones that share its values and ideals.

The Ellemann-Jensen doctrine is thus, that a small country – like Denmark – can affect world politics through successfully building alliances to promote its foreign policy goals. An unstated implication of this is that a small country should therefore also be willing to adopt and support the goals of its allies in return.

== Historical context ==
===Danish isolationism===
In the context of Danish political history, the doctrine can be seen as the official break with the isolationist &quot;Spirit of 1864&quot; international policy outlook. In 1864, Denmark lost Second war of Schleswig the last in a series of military defeats resulting in a loss of three quarters of its territory. The &quot;Spirit of &#x27;64&quot; can be summed up in the slogan, &quot;what was lost outwards must be won inwards&quot;; Danish policy became a high level of deference towards neighbouring nations and an emphasis on domestic development. Denmark did thus not join any of the European alliances at that time and sought to remain uninvolved in emerging conflicts. Military investments were seldom and primarily defensive. The idea driving these policies was that a country as small as Denmark would be unable to affect the rest of the world.

Following World War I, where Denmark had remained neutral, it was offered larger tracts of German territory by France and the allies. However, unlike the eastern neighbours, it opted for a settlement by plebiscite including rights for the Germans in Denmark and vice versa. It proved partly successful as the Danish-German border remained one of the few borders which a resurgent Germany did not contest. When Denmark was invaded in World War II, the &quot;Spirit of &#x27;64&quot; was seen this time in the form of a swift Danish surrender and a subsequent policy of collaboration. Since Denmark stood no chance of defeating the German invaders alone, it was useless to fight. The policy saved Danish lives but allowed Germany to occupy the country with minimal troops, freeing up troops for the assault on France. Denmark&#x27;s response stands in stark contrast to the heavy opposition to German invasion given by Norway, for instance.

===NATO membership===
The first cracks in the isolationist policy occurred after WWII, when Denmark – fearful of the then Soviet occupation of its Baltic islands – joined NATO. This was further expanded during the so-called &quot;footnote policies&quot; of the 1980s, where the Danish Social Democrats sought a political weakening of the NATO alliance, much like France, through a tactic of inserting footnotes containing reservations or objections into every NATO document that Denmark agreed upon.

===Ellemann-Jensen&#x27;s foreign policy===
The true re-entry of Denmark unto the world political scene occurred under the foreign ministry of Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, during which Denmark made a number of bold international moves. Notably, Denmark led the European recognition of the restored independence of the Baltic States in 1991 when it became the first to re-establish diplomatic relations. Lesser known is his dispatchment of a small number of military advisors to the Baltic nations, a move that was quickly joined by other Nordic nations, eventually forming a successful lobbying campaign within the Western world for a quick recognition of the Baltic states.

===After Ellemann-Jensen===
Under the following government led by the Danish Social Democrats the Ellemann-Jensen doctrine was carried on, and Denmark did not only dispatch peacekeepers to the Balkans in the 1990s, but also had no qualms about committing them to fight if need be. Denmark also became more vocal in the United Nations, launching – for instance – resolutions against human rights abuses in China.

Former prime minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen, who succeeded Uffe Ellemann-Jensen as leader of the Liberal party, deployed Danish troops in the 2003 Iraq war, arguing it was indeed a battle between good and evil. Rasmussen also became the first Danish prime minister to officially denounce the Danish collaboration policy during the Second World War.

<text>Gateholm or Gateholm Island is a small tidal island off the south west coast of Pembrokeshire, in the community of Marloes and St Brides, in the south west side of Wales, in the west of the UK, and about 8 miles (13 km) west of the port of Milford Haven. It is known for its Romano-British remains. Gateholm is owned by the National Trust as part of their Marloes Sands and Mere estate.

==Name==

The name, recorded as &quot;Goteholme&quot; in 1480, derives from Old Norse for &quot;goat island&quot;.

==Geography==

Gateholm is at the western end of Marloes Sands, and is accessible only at low tide. Gateholm rises to a small plateau 40 metres (131 feet) high, and with an area of about . The island consists of steeply-dipping Old Red Sandstone. The rock strata date from the Prídolí Epoch of the Silurian; the exceptional exposure here and on the adjoining Albion Sands have resulted in the location&#x27;s inclusion in the Geological Conservation Review as a candidate for protection as a geological site of special scientific interest (SSSI).

==National Trust and statutory protection==
Gateholm was bought by the National Trust in 1981 under Enterprise Neptune, a longterm project to acquire and maintain stretches of coastline to retain its character and preserve its wildlife. The National Trust had already been given over 450 acres on Marloes Peninsula, including Marloes Court Farm, donated in 1941, which included the Marloes Sands and Albion Sands coastline. This, along with adjacent donations of West Hook (1940), Runwayskiln Farm (1941) and Trehill Farm (1942), meant the Trust already owned much of the peninsula and its coast. The acquisition in 1981 of Gateholm plus the Martin&#x27;s Haven deer park at the western headland, meant the entire coastline and peninsula could be managed under National Trust leases and access arrangements. It is now known as &#x27;Marloes Sands and Mere&#x27;, and incorporates the Marloes Mere inland SSSI as well as parts of two coastal SSSIs, &#x27;Dale and South Marloes Coast&#x27;, and &#x27;St Brides Bay South&#x27;, which between them give legal protection to the whole coastline of the Peninsula. The Gateholm coastline also lies within two European designated areas. The &#x27;Pembrokeshire Marine&#x27; Special Area of Conservation is notable for its bays, reefs and grey seals, whilst the Special Protection Area for &#x27;Skomer, Skokholm and the seas off Pembrokeshire&#x27;, gives protection for the large breeding seabird populations.

==Archaeology==
The island contained around 130 roundhouses as well as huts of a rectangular shape. The rectangular houses were mostly arranged in rows end-on and surrounded by small courtyards. Excavations of some of these hut sites conducted in 1910 and 1930 found evidence for occupation in the Roman period, with finds including pottery, coins, and a small bronze stag. There was also a bronze pin of Irish origin and dating from the 6th century. One of the houses had a stone phallus buried upright in one of the main post holes. The houses were built of turf with stone facings, the roof being carried on a ridge-pole between the posts. The site has been interpreted variously as a native Romano-British settlement with later occupation, and as an early monastic complex.

==Filming==
Gateholm was the subject of an episode of the British archaeology television series, &quot;Time Team&quot; (Series 19, episode 01). The island featured prominently in the 2011 film &quot;Snow White and the Huntsman&quot;; a computer-generated castle was superimposed on the island post-production.

<text>John Diamond (10 May 1953 – 2 March 2001) was an English journalist and broadcaster. In 1997 he was diagnosed with throat cancer, a subject he wrote about in his weekly column at &quot;The Times&quot;, as well as in two books (one published posthumously). He was married to food writer and celebrity chef Nigella Lawson from 1992 until his death in 2001, and had two children.

==Education and training==
Diamond was the son of a biochemist and a fashion designer, and had a secular Jewish upbringing. He grew up in Upper Clapton and Woodford Green, he then attended the City of London School and trained as an English teacher at Trent Park College of Education, now part of Middlesex University. Later he taught at an all-girls secondary school, Dalston Mount Comprehensive in Hackney, London, before switching to journalism.

==Journalism==
Diamond wrote a regular column for the Saturday edition of &quot;The Times&quot; from 1992 onwards called &quot;Something for the Weekend&quot;, and worked as a presenter on BBC radio and television. He met his second wife, Nigella Lawson, when they were both writing for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. They married in Venice in 1992 and had two children.

==Illness, awards and death==
In 1997, Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer. He wrote about his experiences with cancer in his newspaper column, for which he won a &quot;What The Papers Say&quot; award. In 1999, he was shortlisted for the Samuel Johnson Prize for his book &quot;C: Because Cowards Get Cancer Too...&quot;. A BBC documentary was filmed for &quot;Inside Story&quot; which followed him through treatment, and showed his frustration with his speech difficulties following throat, and later tongue, surgery.

&quot;C: Because Cowards Get Cancer Too...&quot; was adapted into a play by Victoria Coren Mitchell called &quot;A Lump In My Throat&quot;, which was itself later adapted for television. Diamond&#x27;s second book, &quot;Snake Oil and Other Preoccupations&quot;, was edited by his brother-in-law Dominic Lawson, editor of &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, and published posthumously (with a foreword by Richard Dawkins). It contained the six chapters of his &quot;uncomplimentary look at the world of complementary medicine&quot; which he had completed before his death, and some of his columns from &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;.

Diamond was the recipient of the HealthWatch Award for 2000.

<doc id="613975" wikidata="Q5138782" url="?curid=613975" title="Cobb &amp; Co">
<text>Cobb &amp; Co was the name used by several independent Australian coach businesses. The first company to use &#x27;Cobb &amp; Co&#x27; was established in 1853 by American Freeman Cobb and his partners. The name grew to great prominence in the late 19th century, when it was carried by many stagecoaches carrying passengers and mail to various Australian goldfields, and later to regional and remote areas of the Australian outback. The same name was used in New Zealand and Freeman Cobb used it in South Africa.

Although the Queensland branch of the company made an effort to transition to automobiles in the early 20th century, high overhead costs and the growth of alternative transport options for mail, including rail and air, saw the final demise of Cobb &amp; Co. The last Australian Cobb &amp; Co stagecoach ran in Queensland in August 1924.

Cobb &amp; Co has become an established part of Australian folklore commemorated in art, literature and on screen. Parallels may be drawn between Australia&#x27;s Cobb &amp; Co and America’s Wells Fargo stagecoach services, both of which played similar and important roles in their respective countries&#x27; histories. Today, the name &#x27;Cobb &amp; Co&#x27; is used by a number of Australian bus operators.

==Establishment==

The original Cobb &amp; Co was established in Melbourne in 1853 at the height of the excitement created by the Victorian goldrushes by four newly arrived Americans – Freeman Cobb, John Murray Peck, James Swanton and John B. Lamber. At first they traded as the &quot;American Telegraph Line of Coaches&quot;, a name that emphasized speed and progressiveness. With financial support from another newly arrived US businessman George Train, they arranged the importation of several US-built wagons and Concord stagecoaches. By early 1854, Cobb &amp; Co operated a daily service to Forest Creek and Bendigo and, soon afterwards, expanded the service to Geelong, as well as other goldfields such as Ballarat.

Cobb &amp; Co&#x27;s horses were changed at stages every 10–15 miles along a stagecoach &quot;line&quot; often at inns or hotels that could also cater for the needs of drivers and passengers. As historian Susan Priestley notes, &quot;Coach lines did not attempt to compete with... railways. Instead, as rail lines extended, coaches were transferred to feeder routes and were timetabled to link in with trains.&quot;

Within a few years, Cobb &amp; Co had established a reputation for efficiency, speed and reliability, although they had not won any of the lucrative mail contracts. Their imported Concord stagecoaches used thorough-brace technology, on which thick straps of leather suspended the body of the vehicle, providing passengers with greater comfort on the rough country roads when compared to coaches with traditional steel-springs.

==Under James Rutherford==

In May 1856, the four partners sold out. Cobb and Lamber returned to the US while Swanton continued in coaching for a few more years. John Peck stayed in Melbourne, eventually establishing a stock and station agency. Passing through the hands of a number of owners, Cobb &amp; Co rose to greater prominence after 1861 when it was bought by a consortium of partners led by another North American, James Rutherford, who like Cobb had arrived during the gold rush. Rutherford&#x27;s partners included Alexander William Robertson, John Wagner, Walter Russell Hall, William Franklin Whitney and Walter Bradley. Rutherford re-organised and extended the Victorian services and won a monopoly on major mail contracts. By 1870 most of Victoria was serviced by a network of coach routes.

In 1860, Cobb &amp; Co introduced its massive &quot;Leviathan&quot; coach on the Geelong-Ballarat service. Built in Ballarat by Morgan&#x27;s coach works, &quot;Leviathan&quot; could accommodate up to sixty passengers and was drawn by a team of eight horses. The interior was fitted with five benches, and included a ladies&#x27; compartment in the front. There were a further seven benches on the roof.

==Expansion into NSW and Queensland==
In June 1862, Rutherford oversaw the extension of the business into New South Wales following news of the Lambing Flat gold rush. Rutherford moved ten coaches from Bendigo to Bathurst with great publicity to announce and establish Cobb &amp; Co&#x27;s presence. Bathurst became the headquarters of a new syndicate led by Rutherford and four others. Rutherford had intended to spend 6 months in Bathurst, but stayed on to the end of his days, becoming one of the city&#x27;s leading citizens. Rutherford established a Cobb &amp; Co buggy and coachworks in Bathurst, and the firm also began to invest in properties — the first being &quot;Buckiinguy&quot; station near Nyngan, New South Wales. On the road, Cobb &amp; Co began buying out or forcing out many New South Wales competitors.

In 1865 Cobb &amp; Co again expanded, this time into Queensland. The first Cobb &amp; Co service in Queensland was between Ipswich and Brisbane. In 1868, a service between Brisbane and Gympie commenced, running twice a week. Services soon expanded into all parts of Queensland and otherwise isolated communities were able to maintain regular contact with the rest of the world. In 1881 the business was transferred to a limited liability company with a capital of £50,000. The largest transport enterprise in Queensland it ran some 3000 horses a total of around 10,000 miles a week. A large coachworks was established at Charleville in 1886. It turned out a variety of vehicles including over 120 coaches.

In 1871, the formal links between the Victorian Cobb &amp; Co (taken over by Robertson and Wagner) and Rutherford&#x27;s New South Wales and Queensland operation were finally dissolved, although harmonious relations continued. In Victoria coaches carrying the name &quot;Cobb &amp; Co&quot; were operated by four local coaching firms running particular routes by mutual agreement and cooperation. In time, successive operators of the various Victorian stagecoach lines would continue to use the trading name Cobb &amp; Co.

In the 1870s, the fare for the 460km journey from Dalby to Roma in Queensland, was about £5 per day with an additional two shillings and sixpence (£-/2/6) for each meal and bed. A driver&#x27;s wage was in the vicinity of £10 to £14 per week, with free meals.

==Beyond Eastern Australia==
In the separate colony of South Australia an independent Cobb &amp; Co Limited took over the South Australian mail and coach business of William Rounsevell in 1866 after several years of ruinous competition. Its ownership was held by four interests of a quarter each. One quarter by Canadians, Peleg Whitford Jackson &amp; Jasper Bingham Meggs; one quarter by Fuller, Hill &amp; Co; one quarter by Joseph Darwent and one quarter by Rounsevell&#x27;s son Ben Rounsevell. This business was taken over by John Hill and Company and years later was merged into Graves, Hill &amp; Co.

Such was the renown of Cobb &amp; Co that the name was also used on coaches operating beyond Australia. Charles Cole, and Henry and Charles Hoyt, who had operated coaches in Victoria, started businesses using the same name in New Zealand in 1863 and, very briefly, in Japan in 1868.

Although he never returned to Australia, Freeman Cobb took his family to South Africa in 1871 to establish a Cobb &amp; Co Ltd stagecoach service with Charles Cole, operating between Port Elizabeth and the new diamond fields at Kimberley. He died at Port Elizabeth in 1878.

==Cobb &amp; Co in folklore==
Through the later 19th century travel by Cobb &amp; Co coach was increasingly romanticized in literature but when Henry Lawson wrote the famous poem forewarning of its demise; &quot;The Lights of Cobb &amp; Co&quot; in 1897, the days of coaching were already coming to an end in Victoria and New South Wales and Australia was an increasingly urbanised society. The nationalistic art, music and writing of late 19th-century Australia romanticized a pioneering rural or &quot;bush myth&quot; and Cobb &amp; Co with its colourful drivers and managers easily fell into this tradition. Writer Sam Everingham also notes that Cobb &amp; Co was &quot;the first great home grown service provider Australia had known... Born out of the country&#x27;s gold rushes, the name Cobb &amp; Co has come to represent the pioneering spirit, a willingness to battle against the odds, to reliably connect far-flung communities.&quot;

Carrying cash and gold, coaches were famously a regular target of bushrangers. Everingham notes that Cobb &amp; Co&#x27;s expansion into New South Wales coincided with an increase in the number of armed hold-ups by bushrangers. At least nine coaches were attacked in the Bathurst district in the seven months after the company established itself there.

Tom Roberts, a key member of the Heidelberg School, painted &quot;Bailed Up&quot; near Inverell in 1895 modelling the figures on &quot;local townspeople including (Cobb &amp; Co) stagecoach driver &#x27;Silent Bob Bates&#x27; who had been held up by local bushranger Captain Thunderbolt three decades earlier.&quot;

==Demise==

Cobb &amp; Co&#x27;s operations across Australia were eventually superseded by the expansion of railway networks, the arrival of cheap, reliable automobiles and the emergence of air mail. In 1920, the Charleville coachworks closed and by 1921, Cobb &amp; Co in Queensland had lost most of its mail contracts running out of Charleville. The company also had a vast amount of debt due to over-expansion into industries like wool. Rutherford had died in 1911 the same year the Company approved its first purchase of motor vehicles. In New South Wales the last coach probably ran on the Hebel-Goodooga-Brewarrina routes in 1913 while the last coach ran in Victoria from Casterton to Mount Gambier in 1916. Australia&#x27;s last horse-drawn stagecoach service was run by Cobb &amp; Co from Surat to Yuleba in Queensland on 14 August 1924. With the rapid decline in wool prices in 1929, Cobb &amp; Co Queensland finally went into liquidation.

Gordon Studdert, a former employee, kept the Cobb &amp; Co name as his Surat store business name until his death in 1955. Following a legal case and settlement with Studdert, the Cobb &amp; Co name was acquired by the Redmans Transport company of Toowoomba, run by Bill Bolton MBE (1905–1973). Bolton also collected and preserved several Cobb &amp; Co. horse-drawn coaches, now in the Toowoomba-based museum.

The Cobb Highway in western New South Wales commemorates Cobb &amp; Co.

==Preserved coaches==


Only one Concord or &quot;Jack&quot; coach of the type imported from the United States by Cobb &amp; Co in the 1850s and 1860s survives. According to Deborah Tranter, while Australian built stagecoaches utilized the thorough-brace technology found on the Concord coach, they were generally smaller, lighter, straighter in line and had less room for passengers than the US coaches. Coaches built at the Charleville coachworks were generally designed for either 8 or 14 passengers. 
In addition to reproductions, a number of original Cobb &amp; Co stagecoaches still exist in varying states of preservation. Often repainted in the 20th century, the provenance of some is now difficult to determine.

These include:
* An imported &quot;Concord&quot; coach built by Abbot-Downing Company of New Hampshire. Imported by F.B. Clapp and Co, c1869 and used in the Ballarat area. It is preserved in original condition and held by Museum Victoria
* Another stagecoach, possibly built in Geelong, Victoria c1880, is held by Museum Victoria. It is believed to have been the last mail coach to operate commercially in Victoria — in 1916.

== Centenary festival ==
The Cobb &amp; Co Festival (Australia&#x27;s Last Run) was held on 16–25 August 2024, celebrating 100 years since the last horse-drawn stagecoach service from Surat to Yuleba on 14 August 1924. An estimated 20,000 people attended the festival. It included a re-enactment of the last stagecoach journey from Surat to Yuleba using a replica Cobb &amp; Co coach leading a cavalcade of more than 300 people travelling on horseback, buggies, wagons and bullocks.

<text>.32 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol, also known as the .32 Auto, .32 Automatic, or 7.65×17mmSR) is a centerfire pistol cartridge. It is a semi-rimmed, straight-walled cartridge developed by firearms designer John Browning, initially for use in the FN M1900 semi-automatic pistol. It was introduced in 1899 by Fabrique Nationale, and is also known as the 7.65 mm Browning Short.

==History==
John Browning engineered a number of modern semi-automatic pistol mechanisms and cartridges. As his first pistol cartridge, the .32 ACP needed a straight wall for reliable blowback operation as well as a small rim for reliable feeding from a box magazine. The cartridge headspaces on the rim. The cartridge was a success and was adopted by dozens of countries and many governmental agencies.

When the .32 ACP cartridge was introduced, it was immediately popular and was available in several blowback automatic pistols of the day, including the Colt Model 1903 Pocket Hammerless, the Savage Model 1907 automatic pistol, the Ruby pistol and the Browning Model 1910 automatic pistol. Gun popularity rose after firearms expert Geoffrey Boothroyd, of the UK, informed author Ian Fleming, his countryman, that James Bond&#x27;s sidearm should be a Walther PPK chambered in .32 ACP. A significant factor in recommending this round was its availability throughout the world in the 1950s.

The .32 ACP has been chambered in more handguns than any other cartridge. Between 1899 and 1909, Fabrique Nationale produced 500,000 guns chambered for .32 ACP.

Heckler &amp; Koch produced the HK 4, their first handgun, in 1967. 12,000 HK 4 pistols were produced in .32 ACP for the German police and other government agencies.

Several long guns have been chambered in .32 ACP, from the Tirmax and Dreyse carbines to the AR-15-style Armi Jager AP-74.

==Design==

The .32 ACP was intended for blowback semi-automatic pistols, which lack breech locking mechanisms. It was John Pedersen with the Remington Model 51 that delivered a true locked breech for the .32 ACP cartridge. The low power and light bullet of the cartridge allowed Browning to incorporate a practical blowback mechanism in a small pocket-size pistol. It is still used today, primarily in compact, inexpensive pistols, unless the pistol is used for ISSF competition, where the cost then escalates. Cartridges in .32 ACP are also sometimes used in caliber conversion sleeves, also known as &quot;supplemental chambers&quot;, for providing an alternative pistol caliber carbine function in .30-caliber hunting and service rifles.

Some comparison of the .32 Automatic as defined by SAAMI and the 7.65 Browning as defined by CIP may be useful. Although some of the cartridge measurements differ by as much as , the names are considered to be synonymous. However, the maximum average pressure as measured by a transducer on the test barrel is according to SAAMI, while CIP allows up to . This may explain why the cartridges from European manufacturers tend to chronograph at higher muzzle velocities than those from American manufacturers.

==Performance==
The .32 ACP is compact and light. While some believe it has marginal stopping power, it has been used effectively by military and police worldwide for the past century. Although .32 ACP handguns were traditionally made of steel, they have been produced in lightweight polymers since the 1990s. Their light weight, very low recoil and very good accuracy relative to larger caliber pistols make them suitable for concealed carry use. Some popular pistols chambered in .32 ACP are the Walther PP and the Walther PPK as well as the FEG PA-63, which is a clone of the Walther PP.

It offers more velocity and energy than the .32 S&amp;W, which was a popular round for pocket defensive revolvers at the time of the .32 ACP&#x27;s development. Although with lighter bullet weights, the .32 ACP also compares favorably to the .32 S&amp;W Long in performance. Some European .32 ACP loads provide similar performance to the .32 H&amp;R Magnum lead flat point and lead semiwadcutter.

Even though the .32 ACP is capable of killing small game, most handguns chambered for this round utilize fixed sights and are designed for use against human-sized targets at fairly close range, which greatly limits their utility as hunting handguns.

.32 ACP is one of the most common calibers used in veterinary &quot;humane killers&quot;, such as the Greener humane killer.

In Europe, where the round is commonly known as the 7.65mm Browning and features a different rimsizing, .32 ACP has always been more widely accepted than it has in America, having a long history of use by civilians, law enforcement personnel, and security forces, along with limited issue by military forces. During the second half of the 20th century, several European countries developed firearms for police, chambered in 9×18mm Makarov while chambering the same pistol for civilians in .32 ACP and .380 ACP. Examples include the Vz. 82/CZ-83 from Czechoslovakia, FEG PA-63/AP 765 from Hungary, SIG Sauer P230 from Switzerland, and P-83 Wanad from Poland.

The cartridge has an increased popularity in the United States due to modern compact concealed carry pistols chambered for it, such as the Kel-Tec P-32, Beretta Tomcat, Seecamp LWS 32 and North American Arms Guardian .32. This increase in popularity has led many ammunition manufacturers to develop new loads for the cartridge to increase performance. However, these subcompact guns typically have barrel lengths around . The traditional steel guns chambered for .32 ACP have barrel lengths around . Different barrel lengths can have a significant effect on bullet performance, with longer barrels providing higher muzzle velocity and energy. For example, a Cor-Bon .32 ACP JHP has when fired out of a barrel and when fired out of a barrel. A shorter barrel length can also reduce the range of a bullet.

<text>There are 44 stations in the Copenhagen Metro, a driverless rapid transit system serving Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Tårnby in Denmark. Of the original 22 metro stations, nine are underground, twelve are elevated, and one is at street level. Christianshavn Station offers transfer between the system&#x27;s two original lines (M1 and M2), which share track between Vanløse and Christianshavn stations. From Christianshavn, M1 branches south traveling to Vestamager Station, while M2 heads southeast to Lufthavnen Station, which serves Copenhagen Airport.

The City Circle Line, which opened on 29 September 2019, has 17 stations, with transfer between the current and new lines at Frederiksberg and Kongens Nytorv stations. The new lines have a stop at Copenhagen Central Station (København H), the largest train station in Denmark. On 28 March 2020, the first part of the M4 line opened, adding two additional stations and an increased number of trains on the København H - Østerport part of the City Circle Line. Transfer from the Copenhagen Metro to regional trains is possible at Copenhagen Central Station, Lufthavnen, Nørreport, Ørestad and Østerport stations. Transfers to S-train services are possible at Copenhagen Central Station, Nørreport, Østerport, Nørrebro, Flintholm, Vanløse and Nordhavn stations.

The Copenhagen Metro opened in 2002, with additional stations opening in 2003, and the M2 branch to the airport completed in 2007. M1 and M2 are in total long, of which is in tunnels and is elevated. It takes 23 minutes to travel on each line from one end to the other. The City Circle Line is intended to form a loop around the city center, with a full circumference taking 25 minutes. The M3 line follows the full circle whilst the M4 line only operates along the eastern half. On 22 June 2024, the M4 was extended to Sydhavnen adding five new stations south of København H with a new southern terminus at København S.

The system is owned by Metroselskabet, a company owned jointly by the municipalities of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg, and the government of Denmark. The metro and its 34 trains are operated by the private company Metro Service.
==Key==
The following list name the stations that opened between 2002 and 2024. It states the station&#x27;s name, which lines serve it, whether it is elevated or underground (the grade), travel time in minutes to Nørreport if the station is located on the M1 or M2, the ticket zone and any transfer possibilities available at the station.

==Future stations==

The M4 was originally planned to service Trianglen, Poul Henningsens Plads, Vibenshus Runddel and Nørrebro stations on a temporary basis. This plan was later abandoned. Since its opening, the M4 serves the København H - Østerport - Orientkaj route. The City Circle Line opened on 29 September 2019 and two Nordhavn stations opened on 28 March 2020. An extension with five Sydhavn stations (København S - København H) opened on 22 June 2024.

The Nordhavn end of the M4 has 2 stations, while the Sydhavn end will have 5 stations.
As the built up areas of Nordhavn expand towards the North-East, no less than 9 versions of a future extension have been examined.

<doc id="613980" wikidata="Q7886722" url="?curid=613980" title="Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers">
<text>The Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw) is a trade union in the United Kingdom, consisting of over 360,000 members. Usdaw members work in a variety of occupations and industries including: shopworkers, factory and warehouse workers, drivers, call centres, clerical workers, milkround and dairy process, butchers and meat packers, catering, laundries, chemical processing, home shopping and pharmaceutical. 

Usdaw relies upon a &quot;partnership&quot; model with large employers such as with Tesco, where the management of both the business and the trade union have &quot;privileged access&quot; to their counterparts. This arrangement, coupled with its actions, has been met with criticism, such as where the union seemingly presents itself as being concerned more with maintaining its positive, comfortable position and easy membership supply than that of fair representation of its members. This attitude has earned the union the pejorative backronym of &quot;Useless Seven Days A Week&quot; amongst workers and trade unionists.

It is widely considered to be on the right-wing on the political spectrum, occupying the &quot;politically conservative&quot; section of the Labour Party. Usdaw is also affiliated to the Co-operative Party. In November 2021, the union was criticised at its refusal to negotiate with a Nottingham-based employer who was proposing a &#x27;fire-and-rehire&#x27; policy leading to workers having to negotiate for themselves.

In September 2024, Udsaw won a Supreme Court battle against Tesco over so-called &quot;fire and rehire&quot; plans put forward by the supermarket giant. The row erupted in 2021 after Tesco proposed firing staff at some distribution centres and rehiring them on lower pay.

==History==
The union was formed in 1947 by the merger of the National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers and the National Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks. Some other unions have since merged in, including the Amalgamated Society of Boot and Shoe Makers and Repairers in 1955, and the Scottish Union of Bakers and Allied Workers in 1978.

==Publications==
USDAW produces a quarterly membership magazine for members, &quot;Arena&quot;, as well as a bimonthly magazine for union activists, &quot;Network&quot;.

===2022 annual survey report===
Statistics taken from the USDAW 2022 annual survey of over 7,700 of its retail members showed that high levels of verbal abuse, threats and assaults were common in the industry. The survey also found the number of incidents has come down since the exceptionally high levels during the pandemic, but remain higher than pre-Covid levels in 2019.

==General Secretaries==
Since 1947, USDAW has had eight General Secretaries:
:1947: Sir Joseph Hallsworth
:1949: Sir Alan Birch
:1962: Lord Allen of Fallowfield
:1979: Bill Whatley
:1986: Lord Davies of Coity
:1997: Sir William Connor
:2004: John Hannett
:2018: Paddy Lillis

==Presidents==
Since 1947, USDAW has had eleven Presidents:
:1947: Percy Cottrell
:1948: Walter Padley
:1964: Dick Seabrook
:1965: Rodney Haines
:1967: Dick Seabrook
:1974: Jim D. Hughes
:1977: Sydney Tierney

<text>The .25 ACP (Automatic Colt Pistol), also known as the .25 Auto, .25 Automatic, or 6.35×16mmSR) is a semi-rimmed, straight-walled centerfire pistol cartridge introduced by John Browning in 1905 alongside the Fabrique Nationale M1905 pistol.

==Design and history==
The .25 ACP was designed because .25-caliber was the smallest John Browning could go while still retaining a centerfire primer pocket, which would be more reliable for self-defense than rimfire primers. As such, the .25 ACP allows for a very compact and lightweight gun, usually a semi-automatic pocket pistol. The .25 ACP was hugely popular after its introduction, with many millions of pocket .25 &quot;mouse guns&quot; being offered on the market. 

Following the Gun Control Act of 1968, most foreign .25 pistols were too small to be imported, however some domestic manufacturers continued to build guns in the caliber. No new .25 ACP pocket pistols have been developed in well over a decade, and it is unlikely that this will change anytime soon. The most common pocket pistols in the United States today are in .22 LR, .380 ACP or 9x19mm.

The cartridge is of semi-rimmed design meaning that the rim protrudes slightly beyond the diameter of the base of the cartridge so the cartridge can headspace on the rim. This semi-rimmed design allows for it to be used in revolvers. Although rare, .25 ACP revolvers were produced in the early twentieth century by Belgian, French, and German gunmakers such as Adolph Frank and Decker. In the late twentieth century, Bowen Classic Arms produced a custom Smith &amp; Wesson revolver in .25 ACP.

==Performance==
The .25 ACP is viewed by some, including &quot;Gun Digest&quot; magazine, as a solid choice for personal defense handguns due to its small size, low recoil, centerfire primer and effective penetration. Because of the delicate nature of the majority of .25-caliber automatics, the vast majority of commercial .25 ACP loads are not loaded as powerfully as they could be. However, more modern ammunition offerings from manufacturers such as Buffalo Bore hard cast lead, Federal &quot;Punch&quot; and Hornady Critical Defense are designed to be closer to the cartridge&#x27;s full potential. Some more powerful loadings of the .25 ACP can even get close to .32 ACP territory. 

The .25 is viewed by others as inadequate for personal defense. Self-defense instructor Greg Ellifritz conducted a study using statistics from almost 1,800 real-world shootings. Of the 68 people shot with a .25 ACP, 35% of them were not incapacitated. 25% of the hits were fatal, one-shot stop was 30%, and 49% were incapacitated by one shot. The .380 ACP, on the other hand, left 16% of people shot not incapacitated. This was a 30% increase from that of the .25 ACP. Ellifritz stated: &quot;I would skip carrying the &quot;mouse gun&quot; .22s, .25s and .32s.&quot; However, he also pointed out that shot placement is more important than caliber (a common argument from .25 users) and concluded his review by stating: &quot;caliber really isn&#x27;t all that important.&quot; Other critics of the .25 ACP have pointed out that the round has trouble penetrating through bone and typically does not have enough energy to ensure the reliable expansion of hollow-point projectiles, and that even if the projectiles do expand, that results in a decrease of penetration.

However, urban legends about the .25 ACP&#x27;s inadequacy (such as claims that a .25 will bounce off a skull or be stopped by thick clothing) are inconsistent with the cartridge&#x27;s historically proven track record. Vasily Blokhin, Joseph Stalin&#x27;s chief executioner, killed 7,000 people in the Katyn massacre using only a Walther Model 2 pocket pistol chambered in .25 ACP. The reputation of the .25 ACP has long suffered from the cartridge only being offered in low-capacity pocket pistols with 2-inch barrels. This short barrel length limits the velocity and energy that a .25 can offer and contributes to the myth that the .25 ACP is less powerful than the .22 Long Rifle. The .22 LR is a rifle cartridge and, as such, is typically tested in rifle-length barrels, which is why the .22 LR appears to be more powerful than the .25 ACP. In reality, the .25 ACP tends to perform better than the .22 LR in pocket pistols, and the maximum pressure of the .25 is higher than the .22. In an 18-inch barrel, a .25 ACP performs similarly to a .22 LR, with a 50 grain projectile traveling at about 1000 feet per second and producing in excess of 100 foot-pounds of energy.

<text>Middleholm, also known as Midland Isle, is a small island lying off southwest Pembrokeshire in Wales, between the island of Skomer and the mainland in the community of Marloes and St Brides. It is roughly circular with a diameter of about and an area of . It is separated from the mainland by Jack Sound and from Skomer by Little Sound.

==History==
The name Middleholm was documented in 1325 in the reign of Edward III, when ferreters were paid for catching rabbits. The island has been in use for considerably longer, with traces of Iron Age walling, and may have been used for summer grazing, despite the lack of natural fresh water. Since 1966, when the rabbit population was killed by myxomatosis, the island has been ungrazed. The name Midland Isle has been used at least as far back as 1578, when it was abbreviated in Latin as &quot;Midlan Insul&quot;. This name was also used in 1833, when it was cited in Lewis&#x27;s &quot;A Topographical Dictionary of Wales&quot;. Modern Ordnance Survey maps use the latter name.

==Geology==
The island is formed largely from a suite of volcanic rocks of Aeronian age (early Silurian) assigned to the Skomer Volcanic Group.

==Wildlife==
The island is known for its seabirds, including Manx shearwaters and Atlantic puffins, and for its plants, including red fescue, sea beet and common tree-mallow.

==Ownership==
The island is owned and managed by the National Trust. It is not open to the public.

<text>Stepan Georgevich Shaumian (; ; 1 October 1878 – 20 September 1918) was an Armenian Bolshevik revolutionary and politician active throughout the Caucasus. His role as a leader of the Russian Revolution in the Caucasus earned him the nickname of the &quot;Caucasian Lenin&quot;, a reference to Russian revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin.

The founder and editor of several newspapers and journals, Shaumian is best known as the head of the Baku Commune, a short-lived committee appointed by Lenin in March 1918 with the task of leading the revolution in the Caucasus and West Asia. His tenure as leader of the Baku Commune was marred with numerous problems including ethnic violence between Baku&#x27;s Armenian and Azerbaijani populations, attempting to defend the city against an advancing Turkish army, all the while attempting to spread the cause of the revolution throughout the region. Unlike many of the other Bolsheviks at the time, he preferred to resolve many of the conflicts he faced peacefully rather than with force and terror.

Shaumian was known by various aliases, including &quot;Suren&quot;, &quot;Surenin&quot; and “Ayaks&quot;. After the Baku Commune was voted out of power in July 1918, he fled across the Caspian Sea with the other leaders of the Commune, known as the 26 Baku Commissars. He and the rest of the commissars were captured and executed by anti-Bolshevik forces on 20 September 1918.

==Early life==

Stepan Gevorgi Shaumian was born to a family of Armenian cloth merchants in Tiflis (Tbilisi), then part of the Russian Empire. His family was descended from the Shaumian line of &quot;meliks&quot; (Armenian nobility) of Meghri; one of his ancestors, also named Stepan Shahumian, took part in Davit Bek&#x27;s rebellion in the 1720s. He became involved in revolutionary politics as a student in Tiflis. He graduated in 1898 and entered the Riga Polytechnic Institute, but left when his family ran into financial difficulties, and found work as a proofreader. In 1899, he formed Armenia&#x27;s first Marxist group in the village of Jalaloghli (today the town of Stepanavan). In 1900, he returned to Riga to resume his education at the Polytechnic Institute and joined the Russian Social Democratic Party (RSDLP). In 1902, he was expelled from the institute, arrested, and exiled back to Transcaucasia.

==Revolutionary beginnings==
In spring 1902, Shaumyan enrolled in the philosophy department of Humboldt University of Berlin, from which he graduated in 1905. In Europe, he met with such exiles from the Russian Empire as Lenin, Julius Martov and Georgi Plekhanov, and was present at the 2nd Congress of the RSDLP, in London, at which the party split into factions, and Shaumyan sided with Bolsheviks.

Shaumyan returned to Tiflis in 1904, obtained a job as a teacher, while working illicitly as a Bolshevik organiser. of the Bolshand became a teacher, and the leader of local Social Democrats in Tiflis, as well as a prolific writer of Marxist literature. By 1907 he had moved to Baku to head up the significant Bolshevik movement in the city. Joseph Stalin, then known as &#x27;Koba&#x27; was also based in Baku. They clashed. Shaumian was arrested on May Day, 1909, but was released after his employer interceded on his behalf, and accused &#x27;Koba&#x27; of being a police agent, as the only person who had known the address of the safe house where he had been hiding. This accusation against Stalin was never proved, and Shaumian apparently accepted his denials, because they continued to collaborate.

In 1914, Shaumian led the general strike in Baku. The strike was crushed by Imperial Army and Shaumian was arrested and sent to prison. He escaped just as the February Revolution of 1917 was beginning.

==The Baku Commune==

===Early problems===

Following the October Revolution (which was centred in Saint Petersburg/Petrograd and Moscow, and thus had little effect on Baku), Shaumian was made Commissar Extraordinary for the Caucasus and Chairman of the Baku Council of People&#x27;s Commissars. The government of the Baku Commune consisted of an alliance of Bolsheviks, Left Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks and Dashnaks.

In March 1918 the leaders of Baku Commune disarmed a group of Azerbaijani soldiers, who came to Baku from Lenkoran on the ship called &quot;Evelina&quot; to attend the funeral of Mamed Taghiyev, son of the millionaire Zeynalabdin Taghiyev. In response, a huge crowd gathered in the yard of one of the Baku mosques and adopted a resolution demanding the release of the rifles confiscated by the Soviet from the crew of the &quot;Evelina&quot;. The Azerbaijani Bolshevik organization Hümmet attempted to mediate the dispute by proposing that the arms were taken from the Savage Division to be transferred to the custody of Hümmet. Shaumian agreed to this proposal. But on the afternoon of 31 March, when Muslim representatives appeared before the Baku Soviet leadership to take the arms, shots were already heard in the city and the Soviet commissar Prokofy Dzhaparidze refused to provide arms and informed the Hümmet leadership that &quot;Musavat had launched a political war&quot;. While it was not established who fired the first shot, the Baku Commune leaders accused the Muslims of starting the hostilities, and with the support of Dashnak forces attacked the Muslim quarters:

On the morning of 1 April 1918, the Committee of Revolutionary Defense of the Baku Soviet issued a leaflet with the message:

Bolsheviks had only about 6,000 loyal troops, and they were forced to seek support from either Muslim Musavat or Armenian Dashnaktsutyun. Shaumian, himself an Armenian, chose the latter. Shaumian considered the March events to be a triumph of the Soviet power in the Caucasus:

According to Firuz Kazemzadeh, the Baku Soviet provoked the March events to eliminate its most formidable rival: the Musavat. However, when Soviet leaders reached out to ARF for assistance against the Azerbaijani nationalists, the conflict degenerated into a massacre with the Armenians killing the Muslims irrespective of their political affiliations or social and economic position. Estimates of the number of Azerbaijanis and other Muslims massacred in Baku and surrounding regions range between 3,000 and 12,000.

The Committee of Revolutionary Defense issued another proclamation early in April 1918, which insisted on an anti-Soviet character of the rebellion and blamed Musavat and its leadership for the events. The Soviet&#x27;s statement asserted that there was a carefully laid out plot by Musavat to overthrow the Baku Soviet and to establish its own regime:

Less than six months later, in September 1918, Nuri Pasha&#x27;s Ottoman-led Army of Islam, supported by Azerbaijani forces, recaptured Baku and subsequently killed an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 ethnic Armenians.

The Bolsheviks clashed with Dashnaks and Mensheviks over the involvement of British forces, which the latter two welcomed. In either case, Shaumian was under direct orders from Moscow to refuse aid offered by the British. However, he understood the consequences of not accepting British aid, including a further massacre of Armenians by the Turks. Major Ranald MacDonell, a seasoned diplomat and the British vice-consul of Baku, was tasked by his superiors to persuade Shaumian to reconsider British support.

===Coup plots===

In mid-summer, MacDonell personally visited Shaumian&#x27;s home in Baku and the two discussed the issue of British military involvement in a generally amiable conversation. Shaumian first raised the spectre of what British involvement would entail: &quot;Is your General Dunsterville [the head of the military force awaiting orders to enter Baku] coming to Baku to turn us out?&quot; MacDonell reassured him that Dunsterville, being a member of the military, was not claiming any political stake in the conflict but was merely interested in helping him defend the city. Unconvinced, Shaumian replied, &quot;And you really believe that a British general and a Bolshevik commissar would make good partners...No! We will organise our own force to fight the Turk.&quot;

Shaumian was under the impression that the Bolsheviks would soon be sending reinforcements from the Caspian Sea to assist him, although that prospect remained highly unlikely. He had sent numerous telegrams to Moscow extolling the fighting abilities of his Armenian units but warned that they too, would soon be unable to halt the advance of Enver&#x27;s army. With this, MacDonell&#x27;s and Shaumian&#x27;s conversation ended with the possibility of accepting British aid in exchange for complete Bolshevik control over the military force, terms the British could not immediately accept.

Relations between the Baku Commune and the British soon reached a turning point when Britain decided to reverse its support for Bolsheviks. Shaumian&#x27;s intransigence had cost him their support, MacDonell was told by a British officer: &quot;the new policy of the British and French governments was to support the anti-Bolshevik forces...It mattered little whether they were Tsarist or Social Revolutionary.&quot;

Over the previous days, numerous people had visited MacDonell, pleading for a withdrawal of British support for Shaumian. Many claimed to be former Tsarist officers offering their service to rise against the Bolsheviks, though MacDonell reportedly suspected them to have been agents working on behalf of the Bolsheviks.

===Expulsion===
On 26 July 1918, the Bolsheviks were outvoted 259–236 in the Baku Soviet. Shaumian&#x27;s support had eroded and many of his key supporters abandoned him. Angered with the outcome of the vote, he announced that his party would withdraw from the Soviet and Baku itself: &quot;With pain in our hearts and curses on our lips, we who had come here to die for the Soviet regime are forced to leave.&quot;

A new government headed primarily by Russians, known as Central Caspian Dictatorship (&quot;Diktatura Tsentrokaspiya&quot;) was formed, as British forces under General Lionel Dunsterville occupied Baku the same day. 

==Arrest and death==

On 31 July 1918, the 26 Baku Commissars attempted the evacuation of Bolshevik armed troops by sailing over the Caspian Sea to Astrakhan, but the ships were captured on 16 August by the military vessels of the Central Caspian Dictatorship. The Commissars were arrested and placed in Baku prison. On 28 August, Shaumian and his comrades were elected &quot;in absentia&quot; to the Baku Soviet. On 14 September, amidst the confusion as Baku fell to Turkish forces, Shaumian and his fellow commissars either escaped or were released. In the most widely accepted version of events a group of Bolsheviks headed by Anastas Mikoyan broke into the prison and released Shaumian. He and the other commissars then boarded a ship to Krasnovodsk, where upon arrival he was promptly arrested by anti-Bolshevik elements led by their commandant, Kuhn. Kuhn then requested further orders from the &quot;Ashkhabad Committee&quot;, led by the Socialist Revolutionary Fyodor Funtikov, about what should be done with them.

Three days later, the British Major-General Wilfrid Malleson, on hearing of their arrest, contacted Britain&#x27;s liaison-officer in Ashgabat, Captain Reginald Teague-Jones, to suggest that the commissars be handed over to British forces in Meshed to be used as hostages in exchange for British citizens held by the Soviets. That same day, Teague-Jones attended the committee&#x27;s meeting in Ashgabat, which had the task of deciding the fate of the Commissars. For some reason Teague-Jones did not communicate Malleson&#x27;s request to the committee, and later claimed he left before a decision was made and did not discover until the following day that the committee had eventually decided to issue orders that the commissars should be executed. On the night of 20 September, Shaumian and the others were executed by a firing squad in a remote location between the stations of Pereval and Akhcha-Kuyma on the Trans-Caspian railway.

In 1956, the &quot;Observer&quot; published a letter written by a British staff officer who recounted a conversation he had had with Malleson, stricken with malaria at the time, on what was to be done to the commissars. Malleson replied that since the matter did not involve the British, they should not concern themselves with the issue. The telegram that was sent told the authorities holding the commissars to dispose of them &quot;as they sought fit.&quot; Nevertheless, Malleson expressed his horror when he learned upon the ultimate fate that had befallen the commissars.

==Legacy and reburial==
Following Shaumian&#x27;s death, the Soviet government depicted him as a fallen hero of the Russian Revolution. Shaumian&#x27;s close relationship with Lenin also exacerbated the already heightened tensions between the British and the Soviets, who placed much of the blame on the British in complicity in the massacre. Anastas Mikoyan was especially active in working to preserve the memory of Shaumian, who he regarded as &quot;his hero and revolutionary mentor.&quot; As American journalist Harrison Salisbury wrote:

During the Soviet period, Khankendi in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of the Azerbaijan SSR was renamed as Stepanakert, after Shaumian. The city of Jalaloghli in the Armenian SSR was also renamed, in Shaumian&#x27;s honor, Stepanavan, a name it has retained in post-Soviet Armenia. Streets in Lipetsk, Yekaterinburg, Stavropol and Rostov-on-Don (Russia), an avenue in Saint Petersburg are named in Shaumian&#x27;s honour. A statue of him erected in 1931 stands in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. Shaumian was also regularly praised by Party leaders in the Caucasus. In 1978, Soviet Azerbaijan&#x27;s First Secretary Heydar Aliyev remarked:

Since the Soviet dissolution, Shaumian&#x27;s legacy has been affected by the impact of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict. In January 2009, Azerbaijan&#x27;s post-Soviet authorities demolished the 26 Commissars Memorial in Baku, which commemorated the 26 Commissars. The move caused an outcry in Armenia, as the Armenian public believed that the reburial was motivated by anti-Armenian sentiment.

A scandal emerged when the Azerbaijani press reported that only 21 bodies were found buried in the park, as &quot;Shaumian and four other Armenian commissars managed to escape their murderers&quot;. The claim was denied by Shaumian&#x27;s granddaughter Tatiana, a historian at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow, who told the Russian daily &quot;Kommersant&quot;:

Historian Ronald Grigor Suny has stressed the importance of Shaumian&#x27;s efforts to &quot;win power for the people democratically and nonviolently.&quot; He added that &quot;the story of the Baku Commune he built provides an important perspective on the Russian Revolution and the subsequent civil war.&quot;

<text>Ramsey Island (Welsh: &quot;Ynys Dewi&quot;) is an island about off St David&#x27;s Head in Pembrokeshire on the northern side of St Brides Bay, in southwest Wales, in the community of St Davids and the Cathedral Close. It is in area. Ramsey means (in Old Norse) &quot;Hrafn&#x27;s island&quot;.

In Welsh the island is named after Saint David (&quot;Dewi Sant&quot;), the patron saint of Wales. It was the home of his confessor, Saint Justinian. The nearest large settlement is the city of St David&#x27;s.

Ramsey Island is less than long and its highest point is above sea level at Carnllundain, and is listed as a HuMP. It is the fourth largest island in Wales, after Anglesey, Holy Island and Skomer, and is surrounded by a number of islets, tidal islands and rocks.

==Geology==
The island has a diverse geology for a relatively small area; it comprises sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks dating from the early Palaeozoic Era. The larger part of the north of the island is formed from mudstones of the Tetragraptus Mudstone Formation (also known as the &#x27;Penmaen Dewi Shale Formation&#x27; and again as the &#x27;Road Uchaf Formation&#x27; (sic) after the Rhod Uchaf locality on the island&#x27;s east coast). However Carnysgubor stands proud to their west as it is formed from a more resistant microtonalite intrusion. In contrast the coastal cliffs between Trwyn-drain-du and Trwyn-Sion-Owen and also between Trwyn Ogof Hen and Rhod Uchaf are formed by sedimentary rocks, the mica-rich Lingula Flags and the sandstones and mudstones of the Ogof Hen Formation. The rock strata are typically steeply tilted and commonly faulted.
Running NW–SE across the centre of the island from Aber Mawr to the vicinity of The Bitches is a band of late Arenig age tuffs and &#x27;pencil slates&#x27; assigned to the Aber Mawr Formation. Its boundary with the sediments to the north is a fault.

The south of the island is dominated by a rhyolite intrusion as are the islets off its southern coast. To the west of the Ramsey Fault which runs from Aber Mawr to Porth Lleuog, is Carnllundain which is formed from the tough rhyolitic tuffs of the Carn Llundain Formation. These tuffs arose as volcanic ash falls, ash flows and turbidite deposits. Smaller areas of dark grey mudstones interbedded with debris flows grouped together as the Porth Llauog Formation occur around the margins of the rhyolite. Part of the southern margin of the inlet of Aber Mawr is characterised by the mudstones and sandstones of the Trwyn Llundain Formation, a part of the Solva Group of Cambrian rocks.

==Archaeology==
Surveys in the 1990s and more recently discovered evidence of prehistoric cairns, field systems, barrows and other anomalies which suggest human activity on the island dates back up to 5,000 years. Mediaeval sites include a holy well and cemetery from the 9th century.

==Recorded history==
From 1082, the island was part of the cantref of Dewisland under the control of the bishops of St David&#x27;s. In the 12th century, it was a place of pilgrimage; St Tyfanog&#x27;s Chapel existed up to the 1600s, when it was described as &quot;decayed&quot;, and there may also have been a chapel to St Justinian.

In the 13th century, the island was reported to be fertile, producing beef, sheep, goats, wheat, barley and oats. In the 14th century, of the island supported horses, cattle and sheep. Rabbits, rushes, heath and birds&#x27; eggs were harvested. A farmhouse, corn mill and lime kiln were recorded in the 16th century, but the farm building was a ruin by the early 19th century. The mill and kiln were in operation until the early 20th century, and in 1905 the island was sold into private hands and ceased being an ecclesiastical holding. A new farmhouse was built early in the 19th century, and was Grade II listed by Cadw in 1992.

==Nature reserve==
Owned and managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), the island has spectacular bird cliffs, coastal scenery and heathland. It is one of the best sites in Wales to see choughs, which are attracted by an ample supply of dung beetles.

Other breeding species include ravens, common buzzards, peregrines, northern wheatears, gulls, auks, Manx shearwaters, razorbills and guillemots.

Ramsey has the most important grey seal breeding colony in southern Britain, with over 400 seal pups born each autumn. In October 2017 the remnants of Hurricane Ophelia were responsible for some 90 seal pup deaths.

With a permanent population of just two human residents, the RSPB Warden and Assistant Warden who live in a farmhouse there, the island is otherwise uninhabited. Tourist boats sail around the island and a ferry service run by Thousand Islands Expeditions operates from Easter to 31 October from St Davids Lifeboat Station on the mainland.

==Ramsey Sound==

The waters around the island have significant tidal effects, and tidal waterfalls occur between The Bitches. The asymmetrical underwater flow can be northward (flood) and southward (ebb), with some turbulence. 
The sound reaches some deep, although a tidal island called Horse Rock protrudes from the water at low tide; the name of the rock was recorded as early as 1583, on an Elizabethan map.

A 400 kW tidal power turbine project was planned from 2014 and the first turbine of three was installed in December 2015. Unfortunately the turbine developed faults shortly after installation, and the developer Tidal Energy Ltd was placed into administration in October 2016.

Ramsey Island is surrounded by a number of smaller islands, islets and rock clusters, including:
*Bancyn-ffald
*The Bitches
*The Bishops and Clerks group, including:
**Carreg Rhoson &quot;and&quot; Maen Rhoson
**Carreg-trai
**Cribog
**Daufraich &quot;and&quot; Maen Daufraich
**Emsger &quot;or&quot; South Bishop (37 metres, 121 feet)
**Llechau-isaf &quot;and&quot; Llechau-uchaf
**Moelyn
**North Bishop (44 metres, 144 feet)
*Carreg-gwylan
*Meini Duon (&quot;Black Rocks&quot;) is the name given to three sea rocks approximately south of Ramsey Island, not far from the Bishops and Clerks. They are made of acid intrusive rock, and are the furthest south-west of the group of small islets and rocks off this coast.
*Trwynmynachdy
*Ynys Bery (&quot;Falcon Island&quot;) (71 metres, 233 feet)
*Ynys Cantwr (&quot;Precentor&#x27;s Island&quot;; formerly owned by the precentors of St David&#x27;s.), a small tidal island south of Ramsey Island. Its highest point is 54 metres.
*Ynys Eilun (, length ) &quot;and&quot; Pont yr Eilun are two islets about east of Ynys Bery. Visiting the island is not easy because of its difficult landing. The surrounding waters are swept by a northeast current caused by Ynys Eilun itself.
*Ynys Gwelltog (&quot;Grassy Island&quot;; 56 metres, 184 feet), a tidal island, in the past considered suitable for pasturing two sheep.
