<text>The Big Kahuna is a 1999 American business comedy-drama film directed by John Swanbeck, and produced by Kevin Spacey, who also starred in the lead role. The film is adapted from the 1992 play &quot;Hospitality Suite&quot;, written by Roger Rueff, who also wrote the screenplay. John Swanbeck makes few attempts to lessen this film&#x27;s resemblance to a stage performance: the majority of the film takes place in a single hotel room, and nearly every single line of dialogue is spoken by one of the three actors. The famous 1997 essay &quot;Wear Sunscreen&quot; is featured at the end of the film.

==Plot==
Larry Mann and Phil Cooper, who are both experienced marketing representatives working for an industrial lubricants company, attend a trade convention in Wichita, Kansas, in the American Midwest. They are joined in their hospitality suite by Bob Walker, a young man from the company&#x27;s research department. Larry and Phil are close friends with a long history together. Larry faces urgent financial difficulties that he alludes to only obliquely; Phil has recently come through a recovery program for alcoholism. Bob, an earnest young Baptist, has few if any regrets. Larry explains that their single goal is to arrange a meeting with Dick Fuller, the CEO of a large company (&quot;the Big Kahuna&quot;).

While the three wait in their suite for the convention downstairs to finish, Larry and Phil explain to Bob how to develop and discern character. They also make Bob the bartender for the evening even though he drinks infrequently. Larry remarks that as he has quit smoking, Phil has quit drinking and Bob is religious, it makes them &quot;practically Jesus&quot;.

Even though he makes a poor bartender, Bob spends the evening talking to people. In doing so, he inadvertently chats with the Big Kahuna, who invites him over to a private party at another hotel. Larry and Phil excitedly coach Bob through their pitch on industrial lubricants down to an amount of information Bob can handle and supply him with their business cards.

As the pair wait for Bob, they reflect on the nature of human life. However, Bob returns to drop a bombshell: he used the time to discuss religion rather than pitch the company&#x27;s product. Larry, dumbfounded, challenges Bob and leaves the room devastated. Phil explains to Bob that proselytizing is just another kind of sales pitch. He explains that making real human-to-human contact requires honesty and a genuine interest in other people. Phil gives his reason why he and Larry have a friendship: trust. He then tells Bob that until he can recognize what he should regret, he will not grow in character.

The next morning Phil packs his things. As Larry checks out, he sees Bob talking again to the &quot;Big Kahuna&quot; in the lobby. They exchange a knowing smile as Bob appears to continue to push his own agenda of preaching God instead of selling lubricants. The soundtrack during the credits is &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Free (to Wear Sunscreen)&quot;, a setting of an essay by Mary Schmich.

==Cast==
* Kevin Spacey as Larry Mann
* Danny DeVito as Phil Cooper
* Peter Facinelli as Bob Walker
* Paul Dawson as Bellboy
* Jen Taylor (&quot;uncredited&quot;) as Mrs. Johnson

==Reception==
&quot;The Big Kahuna&quot; garnered a generally positive critical reception while earning modest returns at the box office.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 73% of 79 critics gave the film a positive review. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Wonderful adaptation of the stage play.&quot; On Metacritic the film has a score of 56% based on reviews from 27 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called it &quot;sharp-edged, perfectly timed, funny and thoughtful.&quot;

<doc id="625715" wikidata="Q15142636" url="?curid=625715" title="Pirate haven">
<text>Pirate havens are ports or harbors that are a safe place for pirates to repair their vessels, resupply, recruit, spend their plunder, avoid capture, and/or lie in wait for merchant ships to pass by. The areas have governments that are unable or unwilling to enforce maritime laws. This creates favorable conditions for piracy. Pirate havens were places where pirates could find shelter, protection, support, and trade.

These havens were often near maritime shipping lanes. Although some havens were merely hidden coves, some were established by governments who employed privateers to disrupt the overseas trade of rival nations. Some of the most famous island strongholds included Tortuga in the Caribbean, Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, and the Sulu Archipelago in the Sulu Sea.

Some historic pirate havens included Barataria Bay, Port Royal, and Tortuga. These provided some autonomy for privateers and buccaneers.

==Impact==
Pirate havens had significant impacts on the history and development of maritime trade and warfare. Some of these impacts include:

===Disruption of trade===
Pirate havens enabled pirates to launch frequent and effective attacks on merchant ships that carried valuable goods across the oceans. This caused losses and damages to traders and shippers who had to pay higher insurance premiums or avoid certain routes or regions altogether. One of the major effects of pirates disrupted trade and commerce by attacking and capturing merchant vessels of all nations. They interfered with the flow of goods and people across the Atlantic, connecting Europe, Africa, and the Americas. Pirates targeted valuable cargoes such as sugar, tobacco, spices, textiles, slaves, and gold. They also seized ships and equipment maritime navigation and communication.

Pirate havens influenced the relations and conflicts among various colonial powers, who competed for control over trade and territory in different parts of the world. Some pirate havens served as allies or enemies to certain nations, depending on their interests or alliances. Some pirate havens also challenged the authority and legitimacy of established governments by asserting their own sovereignty or autonomy.

Dealers who had set up their business in various locations in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean purchased goods from pirates. They paid a lower price for these goods than they would have paid to merchant ships in any other port, and the pirates accepted their money, even if they sold at a lower price than the value. The dealers then transported their goods to ports where they sold them through the same channels that they would have followed if the trade process had not been interrupted by the pirates. This created competition and influenced the market prices of many products.

Some colonial officials cooperated with pirates and offered them better prices for their loot than they could get in a safe port. One of the most well-known of these officials was Charles Eden, the governor of North Carolina, who granted pardons to famous pirates like Edward Teach (also known as Blackbeard) and Stede Bonnet. He even let Teach set up a pirate base at Ocracoke Island. This cooperation weakened the authority and legitimacy of colonial governments and increased piracy.

===Influence on politics===

===Social and cultural aspects of pirate havens===
Pirate havens contributed to the creation and dissemination of pirate culture and mythology that have fascinated generations of people around the world. Pirate havens inspired stories, legends, songs, movies, books, games, and other forms of art and entertainment that depict the lives and adventures of pirates.

# Cosmopolitanism and cultural exchange: Pirate havens were home to a diverse mix of people from various backgrounds and cultures. This diversity led to a rich cultural exchange, with people sharing ideas, languages, and customs, as well as forming new hybrid identities.
# Religious tolerance: In contrast to the religious intolerance that characterized much of Europe during this time, pirate havens were often marked by a high degree of religious tolerance. While Christianity was the dominant faith in many of these communities, Muslims and Jews were often allowed to practice their religion freely.
# Egalitarianism: Pirate utopias tended to be more egalitarian than the societies from which their inhabitants came. Hierarchies based on birth, wealth, and social status were less important in these communities, and many pirates adhered to a code that emphasized equal distribution of wealth and power.
# Democracy and self-governance: Some pirate havens functioned as self-governing communities, with pirates electing their leaders and making collective decisions on matters of governance and strategy. This democratic ethos contrasted sharply with the monarchical and authoritarian systems that prevailed in Europe at the time.
# Resistance and autonomy: Pirate utopias were often seen as bastions of resistance against European powers, with pirates engaging in acts of defiance and rebellion against the prevailing order. These communities served as a symbol of autonomy and freedom, challenging the hegemony of the European states.

==Characteristics==
Pirate havens had some common characteristics that made them attractive to pirates. These include:

* Geographic features: Pirate havens were usually located near natural harbors or coves that provided shelter from storms and visibility from enemies. They were also close to busy shipping routes or trade winds that facilitated navigation and interception of merchant vessels.
* Political features: Pirate havens were often under the jurisdiction of weak or corrupt governments that either ignored or tolerated piracy. Some governments even encouraged or sponsored piracy as a way of weakening their rivals or gaining revenue from taxes or bribes. Some pirate havens had their own self-governing systems or codes of conduct that regulated their activities and disputes.
* Economic features: Pirate havens were hubs of trade and commerce where pirates could sell their loot, buy supplies, hire crew members, or exchange information. They also offered various services and entertainment for pirates, such as taverns, brothels, gambling dens, or markets.
* Social features: Pirate havens were places where pirates could find companionship and solidarity with other outlaws who shared their lifestyle and values. They also fostered a sense of identity and culture among pirates who came from different backgrounds and nationalities.

==Barbary Coast==
Historically, the Barbary Coast contained a number of pirate havens, notably Salé, Algiers, and Tunis. These pirate havens were used by corsairs from the 16th to the 19th century. The pirates ravaged European shipping and enslaved thousands of captives. The Pirate Republic of Salé, in 17th century Morocco, was a micronation with its own seaport argot known as &quot;Franco&quot;, since like other pirate states, it from time to time made treaties with European governments, agreeing not to attack their fleets.

Mehdya (La Mamora) in Morocco was a pirate haven in the early 17th century. Another notable base for Barbary corsairs was Ghar al Milh (Porto Farina) in Tunisia.

The United States Navy was founded, in part, to counter the activities of the Barbary pirates, and the United States fought the First and Second Barbary Wars (1801–1805, 1815) to end this threat to its shipping.

==Ireland==
In the early 17th century in Munster (Ireland&#x27;s southernmost province), Leamcon (near Schull) was a pirate stronghold, while pirates traded easily in nearby Baltimore and Whiddy Island. Munster&#x27;s coast provided favorable geography in the form of harbors, bays, islands, anchorages and headlands, while the province&#x27;s remoteness made it difficult to control from London or Dublin. Literate pirates in Ireland could, till 1613, escape secular trial (making their prosecution much more difficult) by pleading &quot;benefit of clergy&quot;. The coast of Munster complemented Mehdya as a base for piracy since, during summers, Mehdya became less safe as the calmer waters favored the galleys used to suppress piracy.

==Madagascar==
One of the earliest rumored places where pirates collected was on the island of Madagascar, off the east coast of Africa. This was their base of operations for their pecking of the Mughal Empire. Here they could prey on the successes of the East India Companies while being a world away from any authority. These are the same outlaws that were plundering the West Indies. The English pirate Henry Every plundered a Mughal ship, gaining immense wealth. Every was said to have settled on Madagascar and was never heard from again, though it was rumored he retired in Ireland. Some writers speculate that this event put in motion a series of events that would help lead to the multitude of laws passed for decades to come.

Madagascar was an island off the coast of Africa that became a refuge for pirates who operated in the Indian Ocean in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. It was a place where pirates could find abundant food, water, wood, and slaves. It was also a place where pirates could establish their own settlements and communities, such as Libertatia.

Madagascan pirate havens included Fort-Dauphin, the town of Saint Augustin, and Sainte-Marie.

A Madagascan pirate colony was established by a group of English and French pirates who sailed to the island in 1698 under the command of Captain William Kidd. They settled on the east coast of Madagascar, near Sainte-Marie. They built a fort and a town, and traded with the local Malagasy people. They also raided ships that passed by the island, and amassed a large amount of treasure. The colony lasted for about 25 years, until it was destroyed by a French expedition in 1723.

==Bahamas==
New Providence was an island in the Bahamas that became a base for pirates who operated in the Atlantic Ocean in the early 18th century. It was a place where pirates could find friendly merchants, governors, and judges who were willing to trade with them or protect them from prosecution. It was also a place where pirates could form alliances and associations, such as the Flying Gang.

==Somali Coast==
In the early 2000s, piracy off the coast of Somalia became commonplace. During this period, pirate havens included Eyl, in the Puntland region of northern Somalia, and Harardhere (Xarard-heere), in the Mudug province of Somalia. During this same time period, the Transitional Federal Government of Somalia was believed to be unable to enforce maritime laws. Other modern havens included Garaad and Hobyo in central Somalia.

==List of examples==
* Barataria Bay in the United States
* Campeche in Mexico
* Crete in Greece
* Harardhere in Somalia
* San Andrés (Tenerife) in Spain 
* Visby in Gotland, Sweden
** See Victual Brothers

===Caribbean===
* Matanzas in Cuba
* Republic of Pirates (New Providence) in the Bahamas
* Port Royal in Jamaica
* Saint Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands
* Tortuga in Haiti
* Virgin Gorda in the British Virgin Islands

===Purported===
* Libertatia

==Pirate utopias==
The American anarchist Peter Lamborn Wilson identified pirate societies as being spaces temporarily outside of the control of states, and consequently proto-anarchist societies. This forms part of his thesis of Temporary Autonomous Zones, spaces or polities in which anarchist conceptions of freedom were briefly enacted during various historical periods.

<text>Story of the Year is an American rock band formed in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1995 under the name 67 North. The band eventually changed their name to Big Blue Monkey in 1998, and then subsequently changed it again to Story of the Year in 2002, after the release of their self-titled EP on the indie label Criterion Records. At the time, they claimed they had discovered that a blues group named Big Blue Monkey already existed. Later, on their podcast &quot;Page Avenue Crew&quot;, they clarified that they just did not care for the name and had just made up the excuse of another band having the same name.

It would not be until eight years after forming that Story of the Year saw its first piece of commercial success in its major label debut album, &quot;Page Avenue&quot; (2003), containing the popular singles &quot;Until the Day I Die&quot; and &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;. A second album, &quot;In the Wake of Determination&quot;, followed in 2005, but did not achieve the commercial success of its predecessor. The band released their third album, &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, on April 22, 2008, which was their first release on Epitaph Records, followed by 2010&#x27;s &quot;The Constant&quot;.

On August 11, 2017, Story of the Year teased a 90-second clip of a new song off their crowd-funded fifth studio album. The pledge campaign began in November 2016 and was completely funded in less than three days. The band used high-profile producer Aaron Sprinkle and mixers Tom Lord-Alge &amp; J Hall to complete their fifth studio album. They confirmed via the pledge site that the new album will be titled &quot;Wolves&quot;, which was released through PledgeMusic on December 1, 2017. The album&#x27;s wide release was on December 8, 2017. And in March of 2023 as a 4 Piece band again, but this time with Sneed gone and the return of Bassist Adam Russell, the band saw the release of “Tear Me To Pieces”, an 11 track epic with a story to tell and a return to their roots. Everything from the sound to the album cover was a tip of the cap to where they first found global fame with “Page Avenue”, and a lyric that speak volumes to their teenage fans of the early 2000’s, as they face modern life as 30-50 somethings.

They followed this up with a world tour in 23-24, selling out shows globally and still putting on the high energy performances they became renowned for in their early days of touring. A band who still, 20+ years later, means the world to their fans and continues to tell the stories that speak to all our Real Lives.

==History==
===67 North &amp; Big Blue Monkey (1995–2002)===
The band were formed in 1995 under the name &quot;67 North&quot; by guitarist Ryan Phillips of the band Means Well, drummer Dan Marsala, vocalist John Taylor and bassist Perry West. They changed their name to &quot;Big Blue Monkey&quot; in 1998 before releasing the first EP &quot;Three Days Broken&quot; that same year. In 1999, they released another EP called &quot;Truth in Separation&quot;, their last under the line-up. In 2000, West and Taylor would both depart from the group, leading to Marsala moving to vocal duties, and the recruitment of Means Well drummer Josh Wills as well as the members&#x27; long time friend Adam Russell of the band Locash on bass duties, despite him never having played bass prior (previously a guitarist prior to joining the band). It was at this point that the band relocated to Orange County, California, where the final Big Blue Monkey EP was released in 2002 titled &quot;Story of the Year&quot;, which they would then change their name to later that year.

===&quot;Page Avenue&quot; (2002–2004)===
After spending many years as a local band with different line-ups, recording three EPs and multiple demos, Story of the Year signed a deal with Maverick Records in 2002, then recorded and released their first album, &quot;Page Avenue&quot;, in September 2003. The first single from that album was &quot;Until The Day I Die&quot;. It first received radio airplay around July–August 2003 on stations like KPNT. The second single, &quot;Anthem of Our Dying Day&quot;, featured a music video directed by Joe Hahn of Linkin Park. Pushed by the success of both singles, &quot;Page Avenue&quot; was a success and was certified Gold by the RIAA in 2004, and went on to sell 846,000 copies in the US by 2007.

&quot;MTV News&quot; reported on their website that during a radio show in May 2004, the band members of Story of the Year got into a fight with the roadies of metal band Godsmack. Pictures of the band members&#x27; bruised faces were posted on their homepage. The members of Godsmack were not involved in the fight.

&quot;Live in the Lou/Bassassins&quot; (a CD/DVD combo of live performances and touring video) was released on May 10, 2005. It was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 2005, indicating shipment of over 50,000 units as it is video longform format.

===&quot;In the Wake of Determination &quot; (2004–2006)===
After the &quot;Page Avenue&quot; tour ended in late 2004, Story of the Year returned to the studio with producer Steve Evetts in 2005, to record their second studio album. &quot;In the Wake of Determination&quot;, released on October 11, 2005, is much heavier sounding than the previous album. As of October 2007, the album had sold 180,000 units and failed to achieve the same success that the band&#x27;s two previous releases had. Although not as successful as its predecessor, the album debuted at No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===&quot;The Black Swan&quot; (2007–2009)===
Story of the Year released &quot;The Black Swan&quot; in 2008. For the album, they brought back producer John Feldmann and Elvis Baskette. The album received praise from music critics and achieved decent commercial success, more so than the previous album. The success was led by the first single off album, &quot;Wake Up&quot;.

For the recording of &quot;The Black Swan&quot;, Story of the Year decided to end their five-year relationship with Maverick and signed with Epitaph Records.

Story of the Year played on 2008&#x27;s Taste of Chaos International tour with Atreyu.

===&quot;The Constant&quot; (2009–2010)===
In May 2009, Story of the Year began work on another album. On December 31, the band released &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot; to radio airplay.

&quot;The Constant&quot;, was released on February 16, 2010, through Epitaph Records. The Deluxe Edition, available on iTunes, has two bonus tracks, &quot;Your Unsung Friend&quot; and &quot;Tonight We Fall.&quot;

Story of the Year recorded a cover of Waterproof Blonde&#x27;s song &quot;Just Close Your Eyes&quot; for professional wrestler Christian Cage. Their cover version was included in WWE Music album A New Day, Vol. 10 that was released on January 28, 2010.

===Side-projects and hiatus (2011–2013)===
Bassist Adam Russell was announced to be the bassist of post-hardcore band Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows, along with Craig Owens (lead vocalist, Chiodos), Matt Good (guitarist, From First to Last), Nick Martin (guitarist, Underminded), and Aaron Stern (drummer, Matchbook Romance). Russell left Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows in 2012.

Singer Dan Marsala formed a fun, comedy punk rock side-project in 2009 named The Fuck Off And Dies. The band has gone on to release two full-length albums, &quot;Songs In The Key Of Fuck&quot; (2011) and &quot;Dear Liver&quot; (2015).

Guitarists Ryan Phillips and Philip Sneed continued to pursue their side project, Greek Fire. They have released a debut EP and two independent albums, &quot;Deus Ex Machina&quot; and &quot;Lost/Found&quot;.

Bassist Adam Russell and guitarist Ryan Phillips set out to make a movie about rise and fall of the music industry and where it stands today called &quot;Who Killed (Or Saved!) The Music Industry&quot;. Funded by Kickstarter, they were filming in 2013.

On February 4, 2011, at The Pageant in their hometown of St. Louis, the band performed their first album, &quot;Page Avenue&quot;, in its entirety, as well as other fan favorites. They posted that this was a &quot;thank you&quot; show to all their dedicated fans for 10 years together. City Spud, of the St. Louis rap group St. Lunatics, made a guest appearance during the show.

===Reunion, &quot;Page Avenue&quot; 10th anniversary tour (2013–2014)===
On March 8, 2013, the band announced they reunited for a world tour to celebrate the tenth anniversary of their debut album &quot;Page Avenue&quot;. It was also stated that the band has re-recorded &quot;Page Avenue,&quot; entitled &quot;Page Avenue: 10 Years and Counting&quot; with release date on October 8, 2013. Originally they planned it to be a full acoustic version of the album, but after the collaboration with City Spud during their concert in 2011 they decided to re-record the album with a different feel to each song rather than just acoustic versions.

===&quot;Wolves&quot; and lineup changes (2014–2019)===

On September 30, 2014, the band announced on their Facebook page that bass player Adam Russell left the band. The band also said they were writing a fifth album. On November 7, 2016, the band announced via their PledgeMusic page that they would be releasing a new album sometime in 2017 entitled &quot;Wolves&quot;. On October 25, 2017, via their Facebook page, the band confirmed the PledgeMusic exclusive release date of &quot;Wolves&quot; on December 1, with the album&#x27;s wide release taking place on December 8. According to Wall of Sound, the album has hints of the band&#x27;s earlier work scattered throughout and a vintage feel, akin to that of Stranger Things.

In March 2018, Philip Sneed announced his departure from the band citing he was let go via management, and not long after, the band announced the return of Adam Russell.

===&quot;Tear Me to Pieces&quot; (2020–present)===

Beginning in October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Story of the Year performed their first three albums in three individual livestreams under the title Ghost Signal.

In March 2021, &quot;Page Avenue&quot; was certified Platinum by the RIAA.

In January 2022 it was announced that Story of the Year would join the When We Were Young festival among over 60 other emo bands including My Chemical Romance and Paramore. The band released their new single &quot;Real Life&quot; on August 24, alongside the announcement that they had signed with SharpTone Records and a new set of tour dates alongside Hawthorne Heights and Escape the Fate. In October it was announced that Story of the Year&#x27;s sixth album would be called &quot;Tear Me to Pieces&quot;, with a new music video for the title track. The album was released on March 10, 2023.

==Musical style and influences==
Story of the Year has been categorized under several genres, especially emo, screamo, post-hardcore, and pop-punk. AllMusic describe the band as &quot;emo punk&quot; and &quot;emo-inflected post-grunge&quot; and the band has also been labeled as alternative rock and melodic hardcore. Story of the Year&#x27;s early material as Big Blue Monkey is considered nu metal.

The band&#x27;s influences include Skid Row, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, NOFX, Pennywise, Sick of It All, and H2O.

<text>JavaOS is a discontinued operating system based on a Java virtual machine. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems. Unlike Windows, macOS, Unix, or Unix-like systems which are primarily written in the C programming language, JavaOS is primarily written in Java. It is now considered a legacy system.

== History ==

The Java programming language was introduced by Sun in May 1995. Jim Mitchell and Peter Madany at JavaSoft designed a new operating system, codenamed Kona, written completely in Java. In March 1996, Tom Saulpaugh joined the now seven-person Kona team to design an input/output (I/O) architecture, having come from Apple as Macintosh system software engineer since June 1985 and co-architect of Copland.

JavaOS was first announced in a &quot;Byte&quot; article. In 1996, JavaSoft&#x27;s official product announcement described the compact OS designed to run &quot;in anything from net computers to pagers&quot;. In early 1997, JavaSoft transferred JavaOS to SunSoft. In late 1997, Bob Rodriguez led the team to collaborate with IBM who then marketed the platform, accelerated development, and made significant key architectural contributions to the next release of JavaOS, eventually renamed JavaOS for Business. IBM indicated its focus was more on network computer thin clients, specifically to replace traditional IBM 3270 &quot;green screen&quot; and Unix X terminals, and to implement single application clients.

Chorus, a distributed real-time operating system, was used for its microkernel technology. This began with Chorus Systèmes SA, a French company, licensing JavaOS from Sun and replacing the earlier JavaOS hardware abstraction layer with the Chorus microkernel, thereby creating the Chorus/Jazz product, which was intended to allow Java applications to run in a distributed, real-time embedded system environment. Then in September 1997, it was announced that Sun Microsystems was acquiring Chorus Systèmes SA.

In 1999, Sun and IBM announced the discontinuation of the JavaOS product. As early as 2003, Sun materials referred to JavaOS as a &quot;legacy technology&quot;, recommending migration to Java ME, leaving the choice of specific OS and Java environment to the implementer.

== Design ==

JavaOS is based on a hardware architecture native microkernel, running on platforms including ARM, PowerPC, SPARC, StrongARM, and IA-32 (x86). The Java virtual machine runs on the microkernel. All device drivers are written in Java and executed by the virtual machine. A graphics and windowing system implementing the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) application programming interface (API) is also written in Java.

JavaOS was designed to run on embedded systems and has applications in devices such as set-top boxes, computer networking infrastructure, and automated teller machines (ATMs). It comes with the JavaStation.

== Licensing ==

JavaSoft granted licenses to more than 25 manufacturers, including Oracle, Acer, Xerox, Toshiba, and Nokia. IBM and Sun announced the cooperation for JavaOS for Business at the end of March 1998.

<text>Shawn McManus (born June 30, 1958) is an American artist who has worked extensively over three decades for DC Comics and other companies, notably for DC&#x27;s Vertigo imprint including the &quot;Fables&quot; series.

==Comics==
Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, McManus entered the comics field in the early 1980s with work for &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; and DC Comics. For the June 1983 issue of &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; he collaborated with Bhob Stewart and John Coffey on &quot;Zenobia&quot;. Six months later, McManus and Stewart teamed with Jim McDermott on &quot;Symbiosis&quot;, also in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; (December 1983). He drew the Green Arrow backup feature in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in 1983-1984. McManus gained wider attention when he illustrated two issues of &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; written by Alan Moore.

McManus worked with writer Todd Klein on &quot;Omega Men&quot;, creating Zirral and other characters for that series. He has drawn issues of &quot;Doctor Fate&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He collaborated with Neil Gaiman on the &quot;Fables &amp; Reflections&quot; and &quot;A Game of You&quot; story arcs in &quot;The Sandman&quot;. McManus&#x27; other Sandman credits include &quot;The Sandman Presents: Taller Tales&quot; and a pair of limited series about the witch Thessaly written by Bill Willingham. McManus&#x27; artwork for Marvel Comics includes &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual &#x27;97&quot; and &quot;Daredevil&quot; #351. In an interview, John Rozum, who scripted that issue of &quot;Daredevil&quot;, recalled:
McManus has contributed to titles from a variety of other publishers, including Atomeka Press (&quot;A1&quot;), Dark Horse Comics (&quot;Cheval Noir&quot;), Exhibit A Press (&quot;Wolff &amp; Byrd: Counselors of the Macabre&quot;), First Comics (&quot;Grimjack&quot;), Image Comics (&quot;Supreme&quot;), Malibu Comics (&quot;The Man Called A-X&quot;), and DC Comics&#x27; Paradox Press (&quot;The Big Book Of Freaks&quot;). He worked on Leah Moore and John Reppion&#x27;s &quot;Wild Girl&quot; (Wildstorm, 2004–2005) with J. H. Williams III, about 13-year-old Rosa Torez who discovers that she can communicate with animals. In 2007, he did an eight-issue run on &quot;Aquaman: Sword of Atlantis&quot; and an issue of &quot;The Creeper&quot; for DC.

He illustrated &quot;&quot; in 2010 and &quot;Cinderella: Fables Are Forever&quot; the following year. He was one of several artists to contribute to the &quot;Fairest in All the Land&quot; graphic novel.

==Children&#x27;s art==
Writer-illustrator and lecturer Mark McKenna, creator of the &quot;Banana Tail&quot; children&#x27;s book series, described his long association with McManus that led to their &quot;Banana Tail: The Early Years&quot; (2009) color print:
==Television==
In 1987, McManus worked on the animated series &quot;Dinosaucers&quot;. For the TV series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, McManus and Mike Vosburg illustrated comic book covers designed to look like the original 1950s comics. The McManus &quot;Crypt&quot; cover is seen in the first episode (&quot;The Man Who Was Death&quot;).

==Awards==
1985 Jack Kirby Award nomination with Alan Moore for Best Single Issue (&quot;Pog&quot; in &quot;The Saga of the Swamp Thing&quot; #32).

<text>Virginia Wolf were an English rock band from Manchester, England. Their two albums were &quot;Virginia Wolf&quot; (1986) and &quot;Push&quot; (1987). The band existed from 1977 until 1988 and featured Nick Bold on lead guitar, Chris Ousey on vocals, Jason Bonham (son of John Bonham) on drums, Jo Burt on bass and David John Hinson on keyboards. They released five singles &quot;It&#x27;s In Your Eyes&quot; &quot;Waiting For Your Love&quot; &quot; One Night&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Break Away&quot; all released on Atlantic Records and &quot;Let It Out&quot; on Warner Sisters Publishing.

The band were formed in Worsley, England, near Manchester. Their first &#x27;self-titled&#x27; album was produced by Roger Taylor from Queen in 1986. To promote the album the band toured the U.S. with The Firm featuring Jimmy Page – Led Zeppelin and Paul Rodgers – Free, Bad Company, and later – Queen. 1987 saw the band (Bold; Ousey; Bonham; Burt &amp; Hinson) fly back to the US to record their 2nd album &quot;Push&quot;, which was recorded at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California and was produced by Kevin Elson (Journey) and assisted by Wally Buck. After returning to the UK, the band played three farewell shows in each of their respective cities, after which they disbanded. Both Chris Ousey and David John Hinson would later go on to form Heartland. Jo Burt played with many well-established artists. Jason Bonham went on to join Jimmy Page and Nick Bold went on to establish a successful solo career.

<text>William Willingham (born 1956) is an American writer and artist of comics, known for his work on the series &quot;Elementals&quot; and &quot;Fables&quot;.

==Career==
William Willingham was born in Fort Belvoir, Virginia. During his father&#x27;s military career the family also lived in Alaska, California, and finally three years in Germany. Willingham got his start from the late 1970s to early 1980s as a staff artist for TSR, Inc., where he illustrated a number of their role-playing game products. He was the cover artist for the &quot;AD&amp;D Player Character Record Sheets&quot;, &quot;Against the Giants&quot;, &quot;Secret of Bone Hill&quot;, the Gamma World book &quot;Legion of Gold&quot;, and provided the back cover for &quot;In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords&quot;. He was an interior artist on &quot;White Plume Mountain&quot;, &quot;Slave Pits of the Undercity&quot;, &quot;Ghost Tower of Inverness&quot;, &quot;Secret of the Slavers Stockade&quot;, &quot;Secret of Bone Hill&quot;, &quot;Palace of the Silver Princess&quot;, &quot;Isle of Dread&quot;, &quot;The Mansion of Mad Professor Ludlow&quot;, &quot;Food Fight&quot;, &quot;In the Dungeons of the Slave Lords&quot;, the original &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;, &quot;Descent into the Depths of the Earth&quot;, &quot;Assault on the Aerie of the Slave Lords&quot;, &quot;Against the Giants&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Spiders&quot;, &quot;Realms of Horror&quot;, and the second and third editions of the &quot;Top Secret&quot; role-playing game. He also wrote and illustrated a couple of 1982 adventures for the game &quot;Villains &amp; Vigilantes&quot; for Fantasy Games Unlimited, &quot;Death Duel with the Destroyers&quot; and &quot;The Island of Doctor Apocalypse&quot;. Willingham also produced the alien race design artwork for the original &quot;Master of Orion&quot; video game.

He first gained attention for his 1980s comic book series &quot;Elementals&quot; published by , which he both wrote and illustrated; this series featured the Destroyers characters from his &quot;Villains &amp; Vigilantes&quot; adventures as guest-stars. He contributed stories to &quot;Green Lantern&quot; and started his own independent, black-and-white comic book series &quot;Coventry&quot; which lasted only 3 issues. He also produced the pornographic series &quot;Ironwood&quot; for Eros Comix.

In the late 1990s, Willingham produced the 13-issue &quot;Pantheon&quot; for Lone Star Press and wrote a pair of short novels about the modern adventures of the hero Beowulf, and a fantasy novel &quot;Down the Mysterly River&quot; published by the Austin, Texas writer&#x27;s collective, Clockwork Storybook, of which Willingham was a founding member. In the early 2000s, he began writing for DC Comics, including the limited series &quot;Proposition Player&quot;, a pair of limited series about the Greek witch Thessaly from &quot;The Sandman&quot;, and the series &quot;Fables&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Fables&quot; won the Will Eisner Comic Industry awards for best serialized story and best new series.

He describes himself as &quot;rabidly pro-Israel&quot; and says that &quot;Fables&quot; &quot;was intended from the beginning&quot; as a metaphor for the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, although he argues that &quot;Fables&quot; is not &quot;a political tract. It never will be, but at the same time, it&#x27;s not going to shy away from the fact that there are characters who have real moral and ethical centers, and we&#x27;re not going to apologize for it.&quot;

Willingham worked on the &quot;Robin&quot; series from 2004 to 2006, and established &quot;Shadowpact&quot;, a title spun off his &quot;Day of Vengeance&quot; limited series. He also wrote &quot;Jack of Fables&quot;, an ongoing spin-off of his Fables series, co-written by Lilah Sturges. At the 2007 Comic Con International, he announced that he would be writing &quot;Salvation Run&quot;, a mini-series about supervillains who are banished to an inhospitable prison planet. He handed over the writing to Sturges after two issues because of illness. He worked on &quot;&quot;, a four-issue mini-series that deals with Green Arrow&#x27;s endorsement of a political candidate. Again with Sturges, he began writing the Vertigo series &quot;House of Mystery&quot;, and DC&#x27;s &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; with issue #29.

In 2009, Willingham agreed to write for &quot;&quot; by IDW Publishing, initiated a new storyline titled &quot;Immortality for Dummies&quot;.

In late 2010 (with cover dates January–April 2011), Willingham wrote the four-issue mini-series &quot;Warriors Three&quot; for Marvel Comics, illustrated by Neil Edwards.

At 2013 New York Comic Con it was announced that Willingham would be writing a seven-part mini series for Dynamite Entertainment (with art by Sergio Fernandez Davila). The series is &quot;Legenderry: A Steampunk Adventure&quot; and includes some of Dynamite&#x27;s licensed and public domain characters in a steampunk setting. The series was released in January 2014, and a collected edition was published in January 2015.

In September 2023, Willingham put his &quot;Fables&quot; series into the public domain after a dispute with DC Comics over publishing and media rights for &quot;Fables&quot;. DC has since responded that &quot;Fables&quot; is wholly owned by them and the company will take appropriate action to protect its intellectual property.

<doc id="625778" wikidata="Q1510488" url="?curid=625778" title="Philosopher's Walk">
<text>The is a pedestrian path that follows a cherry-tree-lined canal in Kyoto, Japan between Ginkaku-ji and Nanzen-ji. First opened in 1890 and extended again in 1912, the path follows the course of a shallow irrigation channel bringing water from the Lake Biwa Canal.

== Etymology ==
The route is so-named because two 20th-century Japanese philosophers and Kyoto University professors, Nishida Kitaro and Hajime Tanabe, are thought to have used it for daily exercise.

== Layout ==
The path passes a number of temples and shrines such as Hōnen-in, Ōtoyo Shrine, and Eikan-dō Zenrin-ji. It takes about 30 minutes to complete the walk, although many people spend more time visiting the sights along the way. On the northern part of the walk, there are good views of the nearby Daimonji. The walk is a popular destination for tourists and locals, especially during hanami.

<text>Texas Country Reporter is a weekly syndicated television program hosted by J.B. Sauceda, which airs in all twenty-two Texas media markets, generally on weekends, and nationally on the satellite/cable channel RFD-TV. It is the longest running independently produced program in the nation, and has received over 30 Emmy awards.

== History ==
&quot;Texas Country Reporter,&quot; originally called &quot;4 Country Reporter,&quot; debuted in 1972 on Dallas television station KDFW (Channel 4, thus the name). It was first hosted by John McLean, then Jeff Rosser, Joe Miser and finally Bob Phillips. Phillips was a photographer and producer when the show first began.

In 1986, Phillips left KDFW and began selling the show in syndication under the name &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot;. In the Dallas market, KDFW did not pick up the syndicated version, but rival station WFAA did and named the show &quot;8 Country Reporter&quot;. 

As of November 2017, Bob Phillips had taped more than two thousand episodes of the program. 

In the 2021-2022 season, the show celebrated its 50th anniversary on the air. 

In 2021, &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot; production company Phillips Productions was acquired by &quot;Texas Monthly.&quot;

Bob and Kelli Phillips stepped down from the program in September 2024. The series continued with new host J. B. Sauceda. 

== Format ==
&quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot; airs 26 new episodes each season, from September through May. Each episode showcases Texas people and places, with an emphasis on rural areas and in a style similar to that of Charles Kuralt&#x27;s &quot;On the Road&quot; for CBS News, who was Phillips&#x27; mentor when he first began his career.

&quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot; posts selected segments to its YouTube page, and some have been featured on local newscasts.

Since 1996, the program has headlined an annual &quot;Texas Country Reporter&quot; Festival, with some of the people who have been highlighted on the show in attendance. The festival was initially hosted in Waxahachie from its inception until 2023. After a 1-year hiatus in 2024, show owner &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; announced it had entered into a partnership with the city of Grand Prairie to host the festival beginning in spring 2025. 

Phillips has authored several books and video series over the years including two cook books, two Texas guide books and, in 2016, &quot;The Texas Country Reporter Collection,&quot; a video series that includes more than 22 hours of stories from the program. A three-DVD highlights set, &quot;Go! Stay! Eat!&quot;, was released September 17, 2005. Two comprehensive video series have been released by Phillips&#x27; company, including &quot;Best of Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Best of Volume 2&quot;.

<text>Juba I of Numidia (, ; –46BC) was a king of Numidia (present-day Algeria) who reigned from 60 to 46 BC. He was the son and successor to Hiempsal II.

== Biography ==
In 81 BC Hiempsal had been driven from his throne; soon afterwards, Pompey was sent to Africa by Sulla to reinstate him as king in Numidia, and because of this Hiempsal and later Juba became Pompey&#x27;s allies. This alliance was strengthened during a visit by Juba to Rome when Julius Caesar insulted him by pulling on his beard during a trial wherein Caesar was defending his client against Juba&#x27;s father and still further in 50 BC when the tribune Gaius Scribonius Curio openly proposed that Numidia should be sold privately.

In August 49 BC, Caesar sent Curio to take Africa from the Republicans. Curio was overconfident and held Publius Attius Varus (Varus), the governor of Africa, in low esteem. Curio took fewer legions than he had been given. In the Battle of the Bagradas the same year, Curio led his army in a bold, uphill attack which swiftly routed Varus&#x27;s army and wounded Varus. Encouraged by this success, Curio acted on what proved to be faulty intelligence and attacked what he believed to be a detachment of Juba&#x27;s army. In fact, the bulk of the king&#x27;s forces were there and, after an initial success, Curio&#x27;s forces were ambushed and virtually annihilated by Saburra (Juba&#x27;s military commander). Curio was surrounded with the remnants of his troops on a hilltop and died in the fighting. Only a few escaped on their ships, and King Juba took several senators captive back to Numidia for display and execution.

With the arrival of Caesar in Africa, Juba originally planned to join Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio Nasica, but his kingdom was invaded from the west by Caesar&#x27;s ally Bocchus II and an Italian adventurer, Publius Sittius. He therefore left only 30 elephants behind and marched home to save his country.

Scipio knew he could not fight without more troops and sent a desperate message to Juba for assistance. Juba immediately left the command of his kingdom&#x27;s defence with Saburra and joined Scipio with three legions, approximately 15,000 light infantry, 1,000 cavalry, and 30 elephants for the Battle of Thapsus. However, he camped away from Scipio&#x27;s main lines. Seeing the certain defeat of Scipio&#x27;s army, Juba did not take part in the battle and fled with his 30,000 men. Having fled with the Roman general Marcus Petreius and finding their retreat cut off, they made a suicide pact and engaged in one on one combat. The idea was that one would meet an honourable death. Sources vary on the outcome, but it is most likely that Petreius killed Juba and then committed suicide with the assistance of a slave.

== Family ==
Juba I was the father of King of Numidia and later Mauretania, Juba II (50/52 BC – AD 23), father-in-law of Juba II&#x27;s wives Greek Ptolemaic princess Cleopatra Selene II (40 BC – 6 BC) and Cappadocian princess Glaphyra, and paternal grandfather to King Ptolemy of Mauretania.

<text>The Newburgh Conspiracy was a failed apparent threat by leaders of the Continental Army in March 1783, at the end of the American Revolutionary War. The Army&#x27;s commander, George Washington, successfully calmed the soldiers and helped secure back pay. The conspiracy may have been instigated by members in the Congress of the Confederation, which circulated an anonymous letter in the army camp at Newburgh, New York, on March 10, 1783. Soldiers were unhappy that they had not been paid for some time and that pensions that had been promised remained unfunded. 

The letter suggested that they should take unspecified action against Congress to resolve the issue. The letter was said to have been written by Major John Armstrong, aide to General Horatio Gates, although the authorship and underlying ideas are subjects of historical debate. Commander-in-Chief George Washington stopped any serious talk of rebellion when he made an emotional address to his officers asking them to support the supremacy of Congress. Not long afterward, Congress approved a compromise agreement that it had previously rejected: it funded some of the pay arrears, and granted soldiers five years of full pay instead of a lifetime pension of half pay.

The motivations of numerous actors in these events are debated. Most historians say that the plot was led by civilians. Their goal was forcing Congress to make good on its long-standing promises to the soldiers. Some historians allege that serious consideration was given within the army to some sort of &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, while others dispute the notion. The exact motivations of congressmen involved in communications with army officers implicated in the events are similarly debated.

==Background==
After the British loss at the Siege of Yorktown in October 1781, the American Revolutionary War died down in North America, and peace talks began between British and American diplomats. The American Continental Army, based at Newburgh, New York, monitored British-occupied New York City. With the end of the war and dissolution of the Continental Army approaching, soldiers who had long been unpaid feared that the Confederation Congress would not meet previous promises concerning back pay and pensions.
Congress had, in 1780, promised Continental officers a lifetime pension of half their pay when they were discharged. Financier Robert Morris had in early 1782 stopped army pay as a cost-saving measure, arguing that when the war finally ended the arrears would be made up. Throughout 1782 these issues were a regular topic of debate in Congress and in the army camp at Newburgh, and numerous memos and petitions by individual soldiers had failed to significantly affect Congressional debate on the subject.

A number of officers organized under the leadership of General Henry Knox and drafted a memorandum to Congress. Signed by enough general officers that it could not be readily dismissed as the work of a few malcontents, the memo was delivered to Congress by a delegation consisting of General Alexander McDougall and Colonels John Brooks and Matthias Ogden in late December 1782. It expressed unhappiness over pay that was months in arrears, and concern over the possibility that the half pay pension would not be forthcoming. In the memo, they offered to accept a lump sum payment instead of the lifetime half pay pension. It also contained the vague threat that &quot;any further experiments on their [the army&#x27;s] patience may have fatal effects.&quot; The seriousness of the situation was also communicated to Congress by Secretary at War Benjamin Lincoln.

==Actions of Congress==
Congress was bitterly divided on the subject of finance, with Rhode Island preventing action. The treasury was empty, and Congress lacked the power to compel the states to provide the necessary funds for meeting its obligations. An attempt to amend the Articles of Confederation to allow Congress to impose an import tariff was decisively defeated by the states in November 1782, and some states had enacted legislation forbidding their representatives from supporting any sort of lifetime pension. Members of the &quot;nationalist&quot; faction in Congress who had supported the tax proposal (including Robert Morris, Gouverneur Morris, James Madison, and Alexander Hamilton) believed that the army funding issues could be used as a lever to gain for Congress the ability to raise its own revenue. They took action and Kohn identifies three main leaders of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;: Hamilton, Robert Morris, and Gouverneur Morris. Jack N. Rakove emphasizes the leadership of Robert Morris.
The army delegation first met with Robert Morris and other nationalists. The politicians convinced McDougall that it was imperative for the army to remain cooperative while they sought funding. The hope they expressed was to tie the army&#x27;s demands to those of the government&#x27;s other creditors to force opposing Congressmen to act.

On January 6 Congress established a committee to address the army&#x27;s memo. It first met with Robert Morris, who stated that there were no funds to meet the army&#x27;s demands, and that loans for government operations would require evidence of a revenue stream. When it met with McDougall on January 13, the general painted a stark picture of the discontent at Newburgh; Colonel Brooks opined that &quot;a disappointment might throw [the army] into blind extremities.&quot; When Congress met on January 22 to debate the committee&#x27;s report, Robert Morris shocked the body by tendering his resignation, heightening tension. The Congressional leadership immediately moved to keep Morris&#x27;s resignation secret.

Debate on a funding scheme turned in part on the issue of the pension. Twice the nationalists urged the body to adopt a commuted pension scheme (one that would end after a fixed time, rather than lifetime), but it was rejected both times. After the second rejection on February 4, a plan to further raise tensions began to take shape. Four days later, Colonel Brooks was dispatched back to Newburgh with instructions to gain the army leadership&#x27;s agreement with the proposed nationalist plan. The army leadership was also urged by Gouverneur Morris to use its influence with state legislatures to secure their approval for needed changes. On February 12, McDougall sent a letter (signed with the pseudonym &quot; Brutus&quot;) to General Knox suggesting that the army might have to mutiny by refusing to disband until it was paid. He specifically told Knox to not make any direct steps, but that he should &quot;not lose a moment preparing for events.&quot; Historian Richard Kohn is of the opinion that the purpose of these communications was not to foment a coup or military action against Congress or the states, but to use the specter of a recalcitrant army&#x27;s refusal to disband as a political weapon against the antinationalists. The nationalists were also aware of a significant cadre of lower-level officers who were unhappy with General Washington&#x27;s leadership and had gravitated to the camp of Major General Horatio Gates, a longtime Washington rival. These officers, Kohn believes, could be used by the nationalists to stage something that resembled a coup if necessary.
The arrival on February 13 of rumors that a preliminary peace agreement had been reached in Paris heightened the sense of urgency among the nationalists. Alexander Hamilton wrote a letter to General Washington the same day, essentially warning him of the possibility of impending unrest among the ranks, and urging him to &quot;take the direction&quot; of the army&#x27;s anger. Washington responded that he sympathized both with the plight of his officers and men and with those in Congress, but that he would not use the army to threaten the civil government. Washington believed such a course of action would violate the principles of republicanism for which they had all been fighting. It was unclear to the Congressional nationalists whether Knox, who had been a regular supporter of army protests to Congress, would play a role in any sort of staged action. In letters written February 21, Knox unambiguously indicated he would play no such part, expressing the hope that the army&#x27;s force would only be used against &quot;the Enemies of the liberties in America.&quot;

On February 25 and 26 there was a flurry of activity in Philadelphia, which may have been occasioned by the arrival of Knox&#x27;s letters. The nationalists had had little success in advancing their program through Congress, and continued to use rhetoric repeating concerns over the army&#x27;s stability. On March 8 Pennsylvania Colonel Walter Stewart arrived at Newburgh. Stewart was known to Robert Morris; the two had previous dealings when Stewart proposed coordinating activities of private creditors of the government, and he was aware of the poor state of affairs in Philadelphia. His movement to Newburgh had been ordered by Washington (he was returning to duty after recovering from an illness) and would not necessarily draw notice. Although his movements at camp are not known in detail, it appears likely that he met with General Gates not long after his arrival. Within hours rumors began flying around the Newburgh camp that the army would refuse to disband until its demands were met.

==Call for meeting==
On the morning of March 10 an unsigned letter began circulating in the army camp. Later acknowledged to be written by Major John Armstrong, Jr., aide to General Gates, the letter decried the army&#x27;s condition and the lack of Congressional support, and called upon the army to send Congress an ultimatum. Published at the same time was an anonymous call for a meeting of all field officers for 11 a.m. the next day.
Washington reacted with dispatch. On the morning of the 11th in his general orders he objected to the &quot;disorderly&quot; and &quot;irregular&quot; nature of the anonymously called meeting, and announced that there would be a meeting of officers on the 15th instead. This meeting, he said, would be presided over by the senior officer present, and Washington requested a report of the meeting, implying that he would not attend. On the morning of the 12th a second unsigned letter appeared, claiming Washington&#x27;s agreement to a meeting as an endorsement of the conspirators&#x27; position. Washington, who had initially thought the first letter to be the work of individuals outside the camp (specifically citing Gouverneur Morris as a likely candidate), was compelled to admit this unlikely given the speed at which the second letter appeared.

The March 15 meeting was held in the &quot;New Building&quot; or &quot;Temple&quot;, a 40 by 70-foot (12 by 21 m) building at the camp. After Gates opened the meeting, Washington entered the building to everyone&#x27;s surprise. He asked to speak to the officers, and the stunned Gates relinquished the floor. Washington could tell by the faces of his officers, who had not been paid for quite some time, that they were quite angry and did not show the respect or deference as they had toward Washington in the past.

Washington then gave a short but impassioned speech, now known as the , counseling patience. His message was that they should oppose anyone &quot;who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood.&quot; He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. He gazed upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed &quot;unshaken confidence&quot; in Congress, and &quot;disdain&quot; and &quot;abhorrence&quot; for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.

==Aftermath==
General Washington had sent copies of the anonymous addresses to Congress. This &quot;alarming intelligence&quot; (as James Madison termed it) arrived while Congress was debating the pension issues. Nationalist leaders orchestrated the creation of a committee to respond to the news, which was deliberately populated with members opposed to any sort of pension payment. The pressure worked on Connecticut representative Eliphalet Dyer, one of the committee members, and he proposed approval of a lump sum payment on March 20. The final agreement was for a five years&#x27; full pay instead of the lifetime half pay pension scheme originally promised. They received government bonds which at the time were highly speculative, but were in fact redeemed 100 cents on the dollar (i.e., at full value) by the new government in 1790.

The soldiers continued to grumble, with the unrest spreading to the noncommissioned officers (sergeants and corporals). Riots occurred and mutiny threatened. Washington rejected suggestions that the army stay in operation until the states found the money for the pay. On April 19, 1783, his General Orders of the day announced the end of hostilities against Great Britain. Congress thereafter ordered him to disband the army, since everyone agreed that a large army of 10,000 men was no longer needed, and the men were eager to go home. Congress gave each soldier three months pay, but since they had no funds Robert Morris issued $800,000 in personal notes to the soldiers. Many soldiers sold these notes to speculators, some even before they left camp, in order to be able to make their way home. Over the next several months, much of the Continental Army was furloughed, although many of the rank and file realized it was effectively a disbandment. The army was formally disbanded in November 1783, leaving only a small force at West Point and several scattered frontier outposts.

Discontent related to pay had resurfaced in Philadelphia in June 1783. Due in part to a critical miscommunication, troops in eastern Pennsylvania were led to believe that they would be discharged even before Morris&#x27; promissory notes would be distributed, and they marched to the city in protest. Pennsylvania President John Dickinson refused to call out the militia (reasoning they might actually support the mutineers), and Congress decided to relocate to Princeton, New Jersey. There is circumstantial evidence that several participants in the Newburgh affair (notably Walter Stewart, John Armstrong, and Gouverneur Morris) may have played a role in this uprising as well.

Although many acts have been passed since to grant pensions to veterans of the revolutionary war, most notably the Pension Act of 1832, escaped slaves who fought in the war were denied pension, one of whom was 80 year old Jehu Grant. Grant&#x27;s 1832 pension application stated that during the Revolutionary War he had escaped from his enslaver, a Loyalist from New England, so that he would not be compelled to serve in the British forces. The application was rejected in 1834 due to Grant being an escaped slave and a waggoner, rather than a regular soldier. However, many freed slaves and slaves who enlisted with their owners&#x27; permission were granted pensions such as in the case of Jeffrey Brace, who was granted pension in 1821.

The main long-term result of the Newburgh affair was a strong reaffirmation of the principle of civilian control of the military, and banishing any possibility of a coup as outside the realm of republican values. It also validated Washington&#x27;s stature as a leading proponent of civilian control.

==Historical analysis==
Historian Richard Kohn writes that a number of key details about the individuals and their motivations are not known, and probably never will be. For example, it is unclear exactly how much Colonels Brooks and Stewart, the principal messengers in the affair, knew. The intent of the Gates group has been the subject of some debate: Kohn argues that they were intent on organizing some form of direct action (although he disclaims the idea that this would necessarily take the form of a traditional &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;), while historian Paul David Nelson claims Kohn&#x27;s thesis is circumstantial and poorly supported by primary materials. A letter written by General Gates in June 1783 illustrates the disagreement: in the letter Gates writes that the purpose of the events was to pressure Congress. Kohn argues that Gates is writing after the fact to cover his tracks, while Nelson claims Gates is giving a candid account of the affair. Historian C. Edward Skeen writes that Kohn&#x27;s case is weak because it relies heavily on interpretation of written statements and is not well supported by the actions of the alleged conspirators. He notes, for example, that there is ample evidence suggesting mutinous sentiments were not obviously circulating in the Newburgh camp between the arrivals of Brooks and Stewart; Kohn counters that the relative quiet in camp masked significant undercurrents of unhappiness.

David Cobb, who served on Washington&#x27;s staff during the affair, wrote in 1825, &quot;I have ever considered that the United States are indebted for their republican form of government solely to the firm and determined republicanism of George Washington at this time.&quot; Skeen notes that the event has served to significantly burnish Washington&#x27;s reputation.

According to a reviewer of &quot;A Crisis of Peace: George Washington, the Newburgh Conspiracy, and the Fate of the American Revolution,&quot; (2019) by David Head, the book: ...casts doubt on the existence of any conspiracy, at least in the sense of an organized challenge to Washington’s command of the army. Head believes the appearance of conspiracy was the product of gossip and private conversations among officers and members of Congress intent on using the officers’ demands to promote a stronger national government. If Head discounts the conspiracy of legend, he makes clear that the disputes over officers’ pay and pensions threatened the legitimacy of the Confederation Congress and the balance of state and federal power, and that Washington sought to protect both. &quot;

<text>Alan Thomas Doyle (born May 17, 1969) is a Canadian musician and founding member of the Canadian folk rock band Great Big Sea.

==Life and career==
Alan Doyle was born and raised in Petty Harbour, Newfoundland, in a Roman Catholic family. He attended Memorial University of Newfoundland in St. John&#x27;s, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. It is also there that he met Séan McCann, Bob Hallett and Darrell Power with whom he formed Great Big Sea. He primarily plays electric and acoustic guitars, and the bouzouki for live performances, but he has been known to play mandolin and banjo.

He is married to Joanne; they have one son.

Doyle has also been involved with a handful of stage, television and film productions. As a child, he appeared as an extra in the movie &quot;A Whale for the Killing&quot;, based on Farley Mowat&#x27;s book of the same name, which was filmed in his hometown. He has also hosted regional arts awards shows in Atlantic Canada, appeared as a presenter on the Juno Awards and done a turn onstage in his hometown&#x27;s &quot;24-Hour Musical&quot; performance of &quot;Grease&quot;. In 2005, he composed music for the CBC comedy &quot;Hatching, Matching and Dispatching&quot;, which stars Mary Walsh. In 2006, he worked on scoring the film &quot;Young Triffie&#x27;s Been Made Away With&quot;, directed by Walsh.
Doyle has been linked to Russell Crowe and his bands 30 Odd Foot of Grunts and The Ordinary Fear of God, having produced and co-written several songs on Crowe&#x27;s album, &quot;My Hand, My Heart&quot;, and played several shows with Crowe. In 2011, they released &quot;The Crowe/Doyle Songbook Vol.III&quot; with nine songs in both acoustic demo and finished format, for 18 tracks total. This friendship also led to Doyle&#x27;s casting as Allan A&#x27;Dayle alongside Crowe, Cate Blanchett, Kevin Durand, and Scott Grimes in Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Robin Hood&quot;, released May 14, 2010. He played Dingy in the film &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, also with Crowe and Durand, as well as Will Smith and Colin Farrell.

He collaborated with &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; music composer Mike Post and wrote and performed a song named &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, written for the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; episode &quot;Broad Channel&quot;.

Doyle has guest starred on three episodes of the CBC Television series &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot; as the character Wolf Redmond. Season 2, episode 2 introduced him as an inmate sent to prison on charges of B&amp;Es and a few robberies. Doyle guest starred with Russell Crowe, Kevin Durand, and Scott Grimes on the first show of &quot;Republic of Doyle&quot;″s third season after the four had costarred on &quot;Robin Hood&quot;. His third appearance – the second with Grimes – was on season 4, episode 6. He appeared in an episode of &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot;&#x27; tenth season.

In 2012, Doyle released his first solo album, &quot;Boy on Bridge&quot;. The title is a nod to Doyle&#x27;s credit as the &quot;boy on bridge&quot; in the movie &quot;A Whale for the Killing&quot;, when he was a young boy. The first single from the album is &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen a Little&quot; and the album features collaborations with Canadian musicians Hawksley Workman, Jim Cuddy, Ron Hynes, and actor-musician Russell Crowe, among others. The video for the second single, &quot;Testify&quot;, was nominated for a 2012 Juno. The creation of the album was captured by a film crew, resulting in a documentary also named &quot;Boy on Bridge&quot; directed by Joel Stewart and John Vatcher.

Doyle, with Great Big Sea, was featured on Canadian country artist, Dean Brody&#x27;s 2012 album titled &quot;Dirt&quot;, singing on the track &quot;It&#x27;s Friday&quot;.

In 2014, Doyle released a book entitled &quot;Where I Belong&quot;, about his youth growing up in Newfoundland and Labrador.

Doyle&#x27;s second solo album, entitled &quot;So Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, was released January 20, 2015.
In 2017, he guest starred in a &quot;Murdoch Mysteries&quot; episode, &quot;A Murdog Mystery&quot; as a man who claims to be a time travelling historian. Doyle reprised the role in the web series &quot;Beyond Time&quot;.

Doyle&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;A Week at the Warehouse&quot;, was released on October 13, 2017. His second book titled &quot;A Newfoundlander in Canada: Always Going Somewhere, Always Coming Home&quot;, was released on October 17.

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic quarantine, Doyle started remotely collaborating with several Newfoundland-based artists to create a special &quot;isolation edition&quot; EP entitled, &#x27;Songs from Home&#x27;, which was released in November 2020. Contributing artists included Fortunate Ones, Rachel Cousins, The Ennis Sisters, and The Once. Per Doyle, &#x27;Songs From Home&#x27; is all about making and keeping connections at a time when it was so difficult to be connected.

On June 14, 2022, he began starring in a musical comedy called &quot;Tell Tale Harbour&quot; at the 2022 Charlottetown Festival. The story is based on the screenplay &quot;La grande séduction&quot; by Ken Scott that was made into the 2003 award winning film &quot;Seducing Doctor Lewis&quot;. Doyle was co-writer of the production as well as co-writer of music and lyrics with Bob Foster. Also credited as one of the authors for a book of the musical with award-winning writer Edward Riche.

Doyle, with Keith Power, writes the music for the Canadian comedy series &quot;Son of a Critch&quot;, for which they have received Canadian Screen Awards nominations for &quot;Best Original Music, Comedy&quot; in 2023 and 2024.

<text>This List of truck types is intended to classify trucks and to provide links to articles on the various types. The three main classifications for road truck by weight are light trucks, medium trucks, and heavy trucks. Above this there are specialised very heavy trucks and transporters such as heavy haulers for moving oversized loads, and off-road heavy haul trucks used in mining which are too large for highway use without escorts and special permits.

==Small trucks==
*Mini trucks, small Commercial vehicles used for delivering light loads over short distances.

==Light trucks==

Light trucks are larger than mini trucks but smaller than medium trucks. In the US, they are defined as weighing between . There is no smaller classification.

*Minivan
*Sport utility vehicle
*Pickup truck/Ute
*Panel truck
**Canopy express
**Panel van
*Tow truck (may also be a medium or heavy truck)

==Medium trucks==

Medium trucks are larger than light but smaller than heavy trucks. In the US, they are defined as weighing between . In North America, a medium-duty truck is larger than a heavy-duty pickup truck or full-size van. Some trucks listed as medium also are made in heavy versions.

*Box truck
*Van
*Cutaway van chassis
*Medium Duty Truck such as Ford F-650 in North America
*Medium Standard Truck
*Platform truck
*Flatbed truck (may also be light-duty trucks)

Many heavy trucks listed are also made in medium duty versions:
*Concrete transport truck (cement mixer)
*Mobile crane
*Dump truck
*Garbage truck
*Log carrier
*Refrigerator truck
*Tractor unit
*Tank truck

==Very heavy trucks and transporters==
Vehicles in this category are too large for highway use without escorts and special permits.

*Haul truck, an exceptionally large off-road dump truck, common in mining operations
*Ballast tractor, a very heavy weight power source for towing and pulling exceptional loads
*Heavy hauler, a combination of power source and very heavy weight transporter

<doc id="625800" wikidata="Q201688" url="?curid=625800" title="Ol Chiki script">
<text>The Ol Chiki () script, also known as Ol Chemetʼ (; &quot;ol&quot; &#x27;writing&#x27;, &quot;chemetʼ&quot; &#x27;learning&#x27;), Ol Ciki, Ol, and sometimes as the Santali alphabet is the official writing system for Santali, an Austroasiatic language recognized as an official regional language in India. It was invented by Pandit Raghunath Murmu in 1925. It has 30 letters, the design of which is intended to evoke natural shapes. The script is written from left to right, and has two styles (the print &quot;Chapa&quot; style and cursive &quot;Usara&quot; style). Unicode does not maintain a distinction between these two, as is typical for print and cursive variants of a script. In both styles, the script is unicameral (that is, it does not have separate sets of uppercase and lowercase letters).

==History==
The Ol Chiki script was created in 1925 by Raghunath Murmu for the Santali language, and publicized first in 1939 at a Mayurbhanj State exhibition. Unlike most Indic scripts, Ol Chiki is not an abugida, but is a true alphabet: giving the vowels equal representation with the consonants.

Before the invention of Ol Chiki script, Santali was written in Bangla, Devanagari, Kalinga and Latin script. However, Santali is not an Indo-Aryan language and Indic scripts did not have letters for all of Santal&#x27;s phonemes, especially its stop consonants and vowels, which make it difficult to write the language accurately in an unmodified Indic script.

For example, when missionary and linguist Paul Olaf Bodding, a Norwegian, studied the Santali language and needed to decide how to transcribe it (in producing his widely followed and widely respected reference books such as &quot;A Santal Dictionary&quot;), he decided to transcribe Santhali in the Roman alphabet: despite his observation that Roman script lacks many of the advantages of the Indic scripts, he concluded that the Indic scripts could not adequately serve the Santali language because the Indic scripts lack a way to indicate important features of Santali pronunciation (such as glottalization, combined glottalization and nasalization, and check stops) which can be more easily represented in the Roman alphabet through the use of diacritics.

The phonology of the Santali language had also been similarly analyzed by various other authors, including Byomkes Chakrabarti in &quot;Comparative Study of Santali and Bengali&quot; and Baghrai Charan Hembram in &quot;A Glimpse of Santali Grammar&quot;. However, the Ol Chiki alphabet is considered (by many Santali) to be even more appropriate for the language, because its letter-shapes are derived from the sounds of common Santali words and other frequent Santali morphemes: nouns, demonstratives, adjectives, and verb roots in the Santali language. 
In other words, each Santali letter’s name is, or is derived from, a common word or other element of the Santali language, and each letter’s shape is derive from a simple drawing of the meaning of that word or other element. For example, the Santali letter “ol” (representing the sound /l/) is written with a shape originally derived from a simplified outline drawing of a hand holding a pen, because the name of this letter is also the Santali word for “writing.”

== Print and cursive styles ==

The existence of these two styles of Ol Chiki was mentioned by the script’s creator: Guru Gonke Pandit Raghunath Murmu (also known as Pandit Murmu) in his book &quot;Ol Chemed&quot; which explains and teaches the Ol Chiki script. &quot;Chhapa&quot; (Santali for &#x27;print&#x27;) is used for publication, while &quot;usaraà&quot; (Santali for &#x27;quick&#x27;) is used for handwriting.

=== &quot;Chhapa&quot; hand ===
Ol Chiki &quot;chhapa&quot;, or print style, is the more common style for digital fonts, and is used in the printing of books and newspapers.

=== &quot;Usaraà&quot; hand ===
&quot;Usaraà&quot; or &quot;usaraà ol&quot; is the cursive style, and is largely limited to pen and paper, though there are digital &quot;usaraà&quot; typefaces. Differences include the diacritic &quot;ahad&quot;, which in print style is used with , , , , and , all of which can form ligatures with in cursive. Further, cursive &quot;usaraà&quot; seldom uses several letter-shapes which are formed by combining the letter and the four semi-consonants , , , and with &quot;ahad&quot;; instead, these are generally written in a shorter form, as .

==Letters==
The values of the Ol Chiki letters are as follows:


Aspirated consonants are written as digraphs with the letter : /tʰ/, /gʱ/, /kʰ/, /jʱ/, /cʰ/, /dʱ/, /pʰ/, /ɖʱ/, /ɽʱ/, /ʈʰ/, and /bʱ/.

== Other marks ==
Ol Chiki employs several marks which are placed after the letter they modify (there are no combining characters):


== Numerals ==
Ol Chiki has its own numerals:
== Punctuation ==
Some Western-style punctuation marks are used with Ol Chiki: the comma (,), exclamation mark (!), question mark (?), and quotation marks (“ and ”).

The period/fullstop (.) is not used, because it is visually confusible with the găhlă ṭuḍăg mark (ᱹ).; therefore, instead of periods, the script uses single or two &quot;Ol Chiki&quot; short dandas:
* (mucăd) marks a minor break
* (double mucăd) marks a major break

==Computing==

=== Unicode ===

Ol Chiki script was added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.

The Unicode block for Ol Chiki is U+1C50–U+1C7F:
=== Fonts ===

* Google&#x27;s Noto Sans Ol Chiki.
* Microsoft&#x27;s font family Nirmala UI.

== Mixing the two letter styles ==
Although Ol Chiki (Chapa) and Ol Chiki (Usara) are normally never mixed, and the original inventor never mentioned mixing these letter styles, there have been some works that mix both forms, using them like English capital and small letters. However, this innovation is yet to be accepted officially.

=== The invention of a lower case for Ol Chiki ===
Since 2017, Santali graphic designer, typographer, and film producer Sudip Iglesias Murmu has been working on design principles to provide a lowercase alphabet form for Ol Chiki, which would permit Ol Chiki writing and keyboarding to use a two-case, or bicameral, format (Using both uppercase and lowercase), as is done in many other written languages, including the Roman-alphabet languages such as English (all of which were once unicameral scripts, but evolved into a bicameral stage over time). As the development of a lowercase form is contributed to developing a standardized cursive form (in those writing systems which use one), the evolution of lowercase is likely to allow standardizing cursive to the point of making it type able alongside more rigid &quot;block&quot; printed letterforms forms So far, only Ol Chiki (Chapa) letters are used in keyboarding, typesetting, and publishing (in effect, producing capitals-only text for the entirety of all printed or keyboarded documents). In writing quickly by hand, Ol Chiki (Usara) is used: but, despite Ol Usara’s potential for reaching high speed, the circulation of Ol Usara documents is negligible, and Ol Usara is yet to receive Unicode standardization, thus leaving it still neglected.

In hopes to remedy this situation and to harmonize the two scripts, Sudip Iglesias Murmu has innovated by creating a series of lowercase letters, which he has integrated with the already existing font of Ol Chiki. According to him, providing lowercase letters increases the efficiency of keyboarding, both for Ol Chiki (Chapa) and for Ol Chiki (Usara), and allows keyboarding to reach the same speed that can be obtained when typing Santali in Roman-alphabet letters, which are likewise case-sensitive. However, his work is yet to be accepted officially.

<text>France 2 () is a French public national television channel. It is part of the state-owned France Télévisions group, along with France 3, France 4, France 5 and France Info. France Télévisions also participates in Arte and Euronews.

Historically, it was created under the name RTF Télévision 2 in 1959, then became the Second Channel of the ORTF in 1964. The national public second channel was renamed Antenne 2 in 1975 and kept this name until September 1992.

France 2 primarily broadcasts television dramas, films, sports events, game shows, talks shows and news programs, aiming to entertain, educate, and inform. It is available via DTT, satellite, cable, IPTV, and the Web. It is also accessible in some neighboring countries, and parts of its programming are rebroadcast by TV5 Monde. Its identification color within the public television group is red, which is reflected in all its on-air branding.

His headquarters, like the other generalist channels of the France Télévisions group, is located in the 15th arrondissement of Paris, along the Seine.

==History==
Test broadcasts began on 10 September 1959. They were transmitted from the Eiffel Tower on channel 12 to broadcast experimental programmes. The channel was scheduled to start on 2 January 1960 on VHF channels 10 and 12. Originally under the ownership of the RTF. However, broadcasts on neighbouring channels led to constant errors, with reception being ruined in one of the two assigned frequencies. This prompted RTF to reserve the UHF band for the service. The channel went on the air for the first time on 18 April 1964 as &quot;RTF Télévision 2&quot;. Within a year, ORTF rebranded that channel as &quot;La deuxième chaîne&quot; (The Second Channel). Originally, the network was broadcast on 625-line transmitters only in preparation for the discontinuation of 819-line black &amp; white transmissions and the introduction of colour. The switch to colour occurred at 14:15 CET on 1 October 1967, using the SECAM system. &quot;La deuxième chaîne&quot; became the first colour television channel in France. TF1 would not commence colour broadcasting on 625-lines until 1 September 1975. Such technology later allowed the network to air programming in NICAM stereo (compatible with SECAM).

The present channel is the direct successor of Antenne 2, established under a 1974 law that mandated the breakup of ORTF into seven distinct organisations. Three television &quot;programme corporations&quot; were established on 6 January 1975 – TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3, now France 3 – alongside Radio France, the Société française de production, the public broadcasting agency Télédiffusion de France and the Institut national de l&#x27;audiovisuel (INA). Antenne 2 and the other corporations were constituted as limited companies with the state controlling 100% of their capital. Although the three channels were set up as competitors vying for advertisers, they retained a collective monopoly over television broadcasting in France that was not repealed until 1981. Privately owned channels such as Canal+ and La Cinq (now superseded by France 5) soon became major competitors to the state-owned channels after the state monopoly was lifted. The breakup of ORTF had been intended to stimulate competition between the public channels but failed in this aim; both TF1 and Antenne 2 came to rely on a diet of popular entertainment shows alongside cheap American imports, seeking to maximise ratings and attract advertisers.

TF1 was privatised in 1987, radically affecting the balance of the French television market. The remaining state-owned channels came under severe pressure from their private competitors and lost 30% of their market share between 1987 and 1989. In an effort to save them, a single director-general was appointed to manage both Antenne 2 and FR3 and the two channels merged to form the France Télévisions group. They were renamed on 7 September 1992 as France 2 and France 3 respectively.

In 1995, the combined audience share of the two state-owned channels was 41%, with France 2 in particular being heavily dependent on advertising and sponsorship revenues, which comprised 43.8% of its budget by 1996. The focus on ratings led to strong rivalry with TF1, for instance prompting the two channels to broadcast popular shows and news programmes in the same timeslots. TF1 and France 2 compete for the same demographics; dramas (including American imports), game shows and light entertainments form the dominant mix on both channels.

Since 3:20 CET on 7 April 2008, all France 2 programming has been broadcast in 16:9 widescreen format over the French analogue and digital terrestrial television. An HD simulcast feed of France 2 has been broadcasting on satellite provider CanalSat since 1 July 2008 and on digital terrestrial television since 30 October 2008.

In January 2024, the channel began broadcasting in 4K UHD.

==Programming==
==Italian coverage==
From 1975, &quot;Antenne 2&quot; was available in Italy (regions of Tuscany, Lazio, Lower Veneto and parts of Lombardy and Liguria) using SECAM and since 1983 using PAL until 2003 when the frequencies were sold to various television networks such as Canale Italia and Gruppo Editoriale L&#x27;Espresso.

On 11 December 2006, France 2 was again made available across Italy on Digital terrestrial television until 7 June 2007, when it was replaced by all-news French TV network France 24.

France 2 is now only available in Aosta Valley due to Italian self-government laws, and in the border zones because of natural spillover.

== Climate issues ==
=== Information about climate change in weather forecasts ===
In February 2023, 2 state TV channels, France 2 and France 3 have begun to enter information regarding climate change in their weather forecasts. This will make the forecasts 1.5–2 minutes longer. The climate related information will rely on experts. The channels will also provide information about climate change and the ways to counter that to their workers. In France, except in case of breaking news they will ask reporters to take the train instead of a plane.

==Controversy==

===Lebanese Civil War kidnapping of Antenne 2 news team===
In March 1986, an Antenne 2 news team was kidnapped in Beirut while reporting on the Lebanese Civil War. Philippe Rochot, Georges Hansen, Aurel Cornéa and Jean-Louis Normandin were four of many Western hostages held by terrorists during the conflict. During the opening sequences of Antenne 2 news bulletins, the headlines would be followed by a reminder of the French hostages held in Lebanon, including others such as Michel Seurat and Jean-Paul Kaufman, with names, photos and the length of their captivity. Within a year, most of the news team had been released and returned to France, but the reminders continued until all the hostages had been freed.

===Muhammad al-Durrah shooting===
On 30 September 2000, France 2 aired the famous footage of the shooting of Muhammad al-Durrah in the Gaza Strip. The scene was filmed by a Palestinian journalist, Talal Abu Rahma, who worked for the station. The voiceover, blaming the killing on fire from the Israeli Defence Forces, was provided by the channel&#x27;s reporter Charles Enderlin. Subsequently, that account was put in doubt, with others suggesting that the fatal shots could not have come from the IDF position. France 2 later launched libel actions against commentators who alleged that the incident was staged. France 2 won a case against one of those critics, Philippe Karsenty who was eventually and definitely fined €7,000 by the Court of Appeal of Paris in 2013. Karsenty had been convicted in 2006, acquitted on appeal in 2008, a decision that was overturned in 2012 by the Cour de cassation.

=== Gaza War 2009 ===
In January 2009, during the Gaza War, France 2 was accused of airing misleading footage that was biased against Israel. It aired portion of a video that purported to show destruction caused by the Israel Air Force, but was shown to be a different incident from 2005 in which the IDF denied having any involvement. After being alerted to the error by bloggers, France 2 acknowledged the error and formally apologized in the magazine &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, saying that it was an &quot;internal malfunction&quot; caused by their staff having &quot;worked too fast.&quot;

===2013 report on weapons smuggling from Serbia to France===
France 2 has been accused of knowingly producing and airing a news item whose key part it fabricated and staged.

On 7 March 2013, France 2 aired an eight-minute investigative report purporting to expose a weapons smuggling channel from Serbia to France. The report authors, journalists Franck Genauzeau and Régis Mathé, traveled to Serbia in February 2013 where they filmed a story claiming that Serbia is a hub for international weapons smuggling. Among its footage, the report showed two masked men – identified as Serbian weapons smugglers – who talked about their supposed illegal activity while showing off some of the weaponry: in particular two hand guns and one AK-47 Kalashnikov. They&#x27;re also shown firing off rounds in the woods.

After the report aired, the Serbian police&#x27;s criminal department (UKP) conducted a month-long investigation, revealing its findings in May 2013 that parts of the French news story were staged with full knowledge of the two France 2 journalists.

According to the police report, Genauzeau and Mathé arrived in Belgrade where they hired a local media fixer named Aleksandar M. who was employed at a Serbian news agency, giving him the task of finding weapons smugglers willing to go before a camera. Aleksandar M. apparently contacted his cousin Nenad Mirković and told him that the French were willing to pay €800 for weapons smugglers. At this point Mirković decided that he himself will appear on camera and also contacted his friend Žarko Blagojević to do the same. In order to make their act more credible, they then obtained two handguns – Zastava 9mm and 7.56mm – from Blagojević&#x27;s father-in-law and father respectively. They also decided to get an automatic weapon by buying it from a certain Milorad Novaković, a resident of Umka. Apparently, the two first offered him €200, but Novaković wanted €350, at which point they went back to two French journalists asking for more money and getting it.

Coached by Genauzeau and Mathé, the footage featuring masked Blagojević and Mirković was shot at a house owned by Blagojević&#x27;s friend in Umka. Afterwards, they went into the nearby woods in Duboko near Umka where they fired off a few rounds for the cameras. They then returned the two handguns to Blagojević&#x27;s father and father in law before selling the Kalashnikov for €100. According to the Serbian police report, Aleksandar M. was paid €300 by the French journalists while Mirković and Blagojević split the €800 between themselves.

Serbian foreign minister Ivan Mrkić reacted to the police report by &quot;seeking explanations from France as the ministry looks to make sure the untruths from the report are clarified&quot;.

<doc id="625808" wikidata="Q2428852" url="?curid=625808" title="Chadlington">
<text>Chadlington is a village and civil parish in the Evenlode Valley about south of Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. The village has four neighbourhoods: Brookend, Eastend, Greenend and Westend.

==Archaeology==
There is a bowl barrow about west of the village. Bowl barrows range from late Neolithic to late Bronze Age, &quot;i.e.&quot; 2400 to 1500 BC. The barrow is a scheduled monument. Knollbury is a hill-fort northwest of the village. It is a scheduled monument.

==Manors==
Chadlington appears to have been at the head of its own hundred both before and after the Norman Conquest, but later on, together with two other hundreds, it became amalgamated into the single Hundred of Shipton. Throughout Oxfordshire there is, however, little evidence for hundredal boundaries prior to the post-Conquest amalgamations. Two separate estates at Chadlington existed by the time of Domesday Book in 1086, each of two and a half hides; and this looks like a &#x27;classic&#x27; case of an original five hide estate becoming split in two before the Norman Conquest. The form of settlement in Chadlington in the late 11th century is entirely unknown, but it is likely that one of the manors was centred on the church, and was located where the surviving manor house is now, immediately to the south of the church. The present Chadlington Manor House is said to be of 17th century date, remodelled in about 1800. However, it is extremely likely that its &quot;site&quot; is far older, and by the late Anglo-Saxon period, may have been occupied by a modest timber thegn&#x27;s hall. The very close proximity between the manor house site and the church suggests a classic &#x27;manorial&#x27; relationship, so that the church is very likely to have been a proprietorial foundation. It is a Grade II* listed building. Lower Court farmhouse was built in about 1700 as the manor house for Westend. It was altered in the mid- to late-18th century and remodelled in the 19th. The house has a Stonesfield Slate roof. It is a Grade II* listed building. The widespread but regrettable local tradition that Chadlington takes its name directly from St Chad is entirely false. In fact, the first element is probably from another Old English personal name, &quot;Ceadela,&quot; of which other toponymic examples exist but it is not as yet attested outside place-names. The full meaning of the name is probably most appropriately given simply as &#x27;the estate/settlement/farmstead associated with &quot;Ceadela&quot;&#x27;.

==Churches and chapel==

===Church of England===
The Church of England parish church of Saint Nicholas was originally Norman, and the blocked head of a Norman window above the north arcade show that the building had a clerestory in Norman times. It is extremely likely, however, that a church, probably of timber, stood on the site by the late Anglo-Saxon period at the latest. The church&#x27;s orientation, which is almost south-west/north-east, is somewhat idiosyncratic, and might suggest that it was inserted into the framework of a pre-existing settlement plan. In the 13th century, Early English Gothic north and south aisles were added, with four-bay arcades linking the aisles with the nave. Both aisles still retain some lancet windows from this period. The bell tower was built early in the 14th century in the Decorated Gothic style. A chapel was added at the east end of the north aisle. The chapel&#x27;s east and north windows in the Transitional style between Decorated and Perpendicular Gothic date it to the chancel about the middle of the 14th century. Later pure Perpendicular Gothic additions include the windows and north door in the north aisle, the present clerestory and nave roof and the chancel arch. In 1870, the Gothic Revival architect Charles Buckeridge completely rebuilt the chancel. St. Nicholas&#x27; church is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has a ring of six bells. Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester cast the second and third bells in 1714. William Taylor of Loughborough cast the fifth and tenor bells in 1846 at the bellfoundry he then had in Oxford. Thomas Bond of Burford cast the fourth bell in 1911. The Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the present tenor bell in 2006. There is also a Sanctus bell that Thomas Bond cast in 1911. In 2001, the Church of England Benefice of Ascott-under-Wychwood, Chadlington and Spelsbury merged with that of Enstone and Heythrop to form the Chase Benefice. The Parsonage was designed by William Wilkinson and built in 1863. It is now Chadlington House.
===Baptist===
Chadlington Baptist chapel was built in 1840. It is now a private house.

===Methodist===

Chadlington has a Methodist church. It is a member of Chipping Norton and Stow on the Wold Methodist Circuit.

==Social and economic history==

Chadlington used to have three public houses, the Malt Shovel (closed down), the Tite Inn, and the Sandys Arms. The Tite Inn was closed between 2009 and 2012; it reopened in 2012 with new owners. and the Sandys Arms on Bull Hill closed some years earlier. Sir Henry Rawlinson (1810–95) and his brother Canon George Rawlinson (1812–1902) were born in Chadlington. Ivan Cameron, son of former Conservative Party Leader and Prime Minister David Cameron is buried in Chadlington.

==Amenities==

Chadlington Football Club play in the Witney and District League. As of January 2023, it has a team in Division One and another in division four as well as a youth team. Chadlington Cricket Club play in the Oxfordshire Cricket Association League. Both clubs are based at Chadlington Sports and Social Club. Chadlington also has a primary school and a playgroup. An annual fun run is held along Coldron Brook: The Great Brook Run. Proceeds of the race, which starts and ends at The Tite Inn, go to the parish primary school. Former Witney MP and Prime Minister David Cameron has taken part in the event.

==In popular culture==
Chadlington is the location for filming of the television documentary series &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Farm&quot; about Jeremy Clarkson and his farm on the edge of the village.

<text>France 3 () is a French free-to-air public television regional network part of the France Télévisions group.

It is made up of a network of regional television services providing daily news programming and around ten hours of entertainment and cultural programming produced for and about the regions each week (similar to ITV in the United Kingdom). The channel also broadcasts various national programming and national and international news from Paris. The channel was known as France Régions 3 (FR3) until its rebranding to France 3 in September 1992 as part of a consolidation of the audiovisual public service under the France Télévision holding.

In 2018, France 3 was the third most watched television station in France.

Prior to the establishment of RFO, now Outre-Mer 1ère, FR3 was also declined as the local service to the various French overseas territories.

==History==
===La Troisième Chaîne Couleur (1972–1974)===
On 22 March 1969, the government mentioned a plan to create a third national television channel. Jean-Louis Guillaud, attached to the Office of the President of the Republic, coordinated the preparatory studies for its launch from November 1969. This new national channel of the French Television Broadcasting Office (ORTF) was to be launched directly in color and to allow better exposure of the regional offices of the ORTF through many opt-outs and through the decentralized production of the channel&#x27;s programmes. The ORTF implemented this project throughout 1972 in the form of a national and interregional channel in color, without advertising or continuity announcers (although out-of-vision announcers were later introduced), offering shorter evenings at different times compared to the other two channels, with a majority of cultural programs, and relying largely on the technical and editorial relays of its regional stations. To accomplish this, the Board is setting up several heavy production centers within its main regional stations to produce programming for the new channel. The most important are those of Télé Marseille-Provence, Télé-Lille and Télé-Lyon. The third channel thus responds to the main concern of reform law no. 72-5534 3 July 1972, on the status of the ORTF, which aims to introduce the decentralization of production and the devolution of decisions on programs the Office.

The third color channel (&quot;La Troisième Chaîne Couleur&quot;) of the ORTF started its operations on 31 December 1972, at 7 pm with its start-up theme, which was followed by the CEO of the ORTF, Arthur Conte, and the general manager of the channel, Jean-Louis Guillaud, who present their wishes to the French for this new channel and for the year to come, calling on the ORTF&#x27;s regional television services and aspiring young staff to join the new network, and then followed by Jean Amadou welcoming the viewers to briefly explain to them what will distinguish this new channel from the two others, in particular in its colorful, dynamic design and the introduction of genre credits before each programme, to replace the announcers, and which are all the work of stylist Catherine Chaillet. Then, the first program, &quot;Jeunes années&quot;, a program for young people, was launched with the cartoon Roulotte, followed at 8:35 p.m. by the inaugural evening of the channel consisting of a variety show written by Maurice Horgues, Jean Amadou and Robert Rocca, directed by Dirk Sanders and produced by the Lille8 production center and whose national sponsor is the singer Anne-Marie David, chosen by the CEO of the Office.

The director general of the third color channel, Jean-Louis Guillaud, decides to make extensive use of the regional stations of the ORTF and young directors for the production of the programs, because the third channel intends to prove itself as a new channel regions and cinema, using state-of-the-art techniques and high-quality graphics. The original project, which planned to rely on the cultural and artistic actors of the regions within the framework of the long-awaited decentralization within the Office, in fact comes down to a simple deconcentration of resources of production, regional television remaining confined to the little space granted in the opt-outs of the national service.

For the first time, the candidates of the second round of the presidential election of 1974, Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and François Mitterrand, agree to confront each other verbally in a televised debate, arbitrated by Jacqueline Baudrier and Alain Duhamel and broadcast on 10 May 1974, simultaneously on the three ORTF television channels.

Audiovisual reform law no. 74-696 of 7 August 1974 abolished the ORTF and created seven independent bodies, including three national television program companies. It came into effect on 1 January 1975, and the third ORTF channel closed its antenna on 5 January 1975, at 9:40 p.m. to make way the next day for the new national program company France Regions 3 (FR3).

For lack of a complete network on this date of 5 January 1975, a good part of France have known the programs of the ORTF&#x27;s third channel. Throughout its run, broadcasts were restricted to three hours each evening and only reached a potential audience of 26% of the population – its transmissions primarily covered Paris, the Ile-de-France and Northern regions.

===Autonomous from the state (1974–1999)===
In 1974, the new President of the Republic Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing asked his Prime Minister to present a communication on the French Television Broadcasting Office to the Council of Ministers on 3 July. Jacques Chirac then assures that &quot;the new organization must be based on competition between autonomous units, fully responsible. It must ensure free and open information, must exclude any waste by relying on streamlined structures. The reports of the State and of the new autonomous units should be limited to the designation of its leaders&quot;. Law No. 74-696 7 August 1974, abolished the ORTF and created seven independent bodies, including three national television program companies, a national sound broadcasting company, two public industrial and commercial companies responsible for the production and broadcasting and a national audiovisual institute. The state monopoly is maintained and each of the companies is placed under the supervision of the Prime Minister. The Office&#x27;s television director, Claude Contamine, was appointed by the Council of Ministers as president of the future national television program company to succeed the ORTF&#x27;s third channel. The choice of a manager from the seraglio responds to the already well-defined face of the future third channel in the law of 7 August, article 10 of which specifies that &quot;one of the national companies reserves a privileged place for the programming of films on television&quot;. This point is also clearly written into the specifications of the national program company France Régions 3, which makes it not only the channel aimed at the regions, but above all the channel of cinema and fiction in the broad sense, FR3 in front should devote more than half of its evenings to the airing of films and TV films. This new national television program company is also responsible for managing and developing the regional radio and television centers created by the Office (22 regional stations and 29 radio centers governed by 11 metropolitan directorates and a DOM-TOM directorate managing 9 stations in French overseas territories). We then count on the productions of the 22 regional stations, then equivalent to 35 minutes of regional television per day.

Law no. 74-696 7 August 1974, came into force on 1 January 1975, with the official birth of the three national television program companies Télévision française 1 (TF1), Antenne 2 (A2) and France Régions 3 (FR3), the national sound broadcasting company Radio France, the French Production Company (SFP), Télédiffusion de France (TDF) and the National Audiovisual Institute (INA).

On Monday 6 January 1975, at 6:55 pm, France Régions 3 begins its operations with a program schedule similar in all respects to that of the former third channel. The channel broadcasts only four hours of programs a day and devotes only five minutes to its inaugural broadcast this evening of 6 January to make way for the film Peau d&#x27;âne by Jacques Demy.

TDF activates the FR3 transmitters at 2 pm, a paradox because the channel then broadcasts both the target and its own programs. Until the arrival of a 24-hour broadcast, TDF will broadcast FIP as background music from 1975 to 2000 on network 3, then France Info until 2002.

FR3 programs are mainly devoted to cinema, debates and regional stalls. The cinema channel, FR3 participates as a co-producer and for a sum of 5,450,000 francs in the development of the seventh art. Following complaints from movie theater owners, who are concerned about unfair competition, Claude Contamine negotiates with the Film Industry Liaison Office (BLIC) to remove the movies from Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings, as well as twelve film showings on Wednesday evenings while in return creating a film club slot on Sunday evenings in the second half of the evening. The agreement was finalized on 16 January 1976, and &quot;Cinéma de minuit&quot; was on the air two months later.

On 1 September 1975, an agreement was signed between the two national program companies FR3 and TF1 to allow the latter, which inherited the first black and white VHF network in 819 lines, to be able to broadcast its programs in color. FR3 agrees to make available the color broadcasting network to TF1 reserved for it for regular transmissions in the afternoon until the start of its own programs at 6 pm. In return, the agreement provides for TF1 to employ the regional production centers for FR33. The overseas station FR3-Comores became FR3 Mayotte on 14 December 1975, following the declaration of independence of the Federal Islamic Republic of the Comoros. With the gradual appearance of more specifically regional television content in 1976, the State very slowly undertook the administrative and economic regionalization of French territory, where regional stations gradually entered into this new framework.

FR3 must separate from its overseas broadcasting station of the French Territory of the Afars and Issas on 27 June 1977, following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Djibouti, although its still appeared highlighted in the channel&#x27;s start-up sequence.

On the programming front, the network&#x27;s first national news programme was introduced in 1978 in the form of &quot;Soir 3&quot;, a late night national and international bulletin. 21 October 1981, saw FR3 begin regular live coverage of ministers&#x27; questions in the National Assembly. Advertising was introduced to the network in January 1983. By September 1983, the twelve broadcasting centres around the country were airing an average of 3 hours per day of regional output. Popular programming on Saturday night included the first airings of the American soap opera &quot;Dynasty&quot; and a &quot;Disney Channel&quot; strand. National and regional news at peak time was integrated into a new nightly programme, &quot;19|20&quot;, launched on 6 May 1986.

On 5 May 1981, the debate between Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and François Mitterrand for the second round of the presidential election, arbitrated by Jean Boissonnat and Michèle Cotta was broadcast simultaneously on TF1, Antenne 2 and FR3.

Although it had long denounced the grip of power on television, the left, which came to power on 10 May 1981, in turn used this habit of interventionism to appoint new presidents to head the national television program companies more won over to his ideas and who are themselves responsible for cleaning up their channel of broadcasts, journalists and presenters suspected of acquaintances with the former majority. Thus, journalist Guy Thomas was appointed president of FR3 on 24 June 1981. He appointed Serge Moati to program management with the idea of strengthening the cultural and regional character of the channel.

Law no. 82-652 29 July 1982, on audiovisual communication suppresses the State monopoly and recreates by decree no. 82-790 of 17 September 19824 the national color television company France Regions 3 which is now the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication, which draws up the specifications, monitors competition rules and appoints the channel&#x27;s president. Guy Thomas is not confirmed in his post by the new supervisory authority which appoints André Holleaux in his place. Alongside the administrative decentralization law, the 1982 law provides for a large decentralization of radio and television. To do this, FR3 ceases to be the operator of the 29 regional radio centers which are transferred to Radio-France and also loses its overseas audiovisual activities in FR3 DOM-TOM to the benefit of the new national program company RFO which had to be created for this purpose.

Similarly, the text of the law provides for the creation of twelve regional television companies, with the same programming and management powers as the national company, with their own board of directors whose president would be appointed by the High Authority. The law also provides for an increase in the share of regional programs on the air, which must go from thirty-five minutes to one hour per day5, which requires an increase in the FR3 budget of approximately 220 million francs which, according to the direction of the chain, could be covered by the opening of the antenna to the publicity of mark whose income is estimated at 250 million francs. On 1 January 1983, the High Authority for Audiovisual Communication authorized brand advertising on the national FR3 network up to 250 million francs per year (i.e. 10% of the combined revenue of TF1 and Antenne 2), although the plan of decentralization in 1982 is slowed down by the authorities, in particular because of the poor results for the majority in the municipal elections of 1983. staff of the three public channels, which the license fee alone is no longer sufficient to finance. Regionalization is at the heart of the specifications set by the High Authority for the channel in 1984. It thus limits the number of film broadcasts per year to 170, identical to TF1 and Antenne 2, which means that FR3 its specificity as a cinema channel in favor of the future new private channel Canal+, leaving it only its regional specificity, and authorizes brand advertising on the regional antennas of FR3.

===Plans to privatisation (1986–1989)===
On 6 May 1986, FR3 changed its look and changed its program schedule by starting at 9 am, instead of 5 pm as it was until then, and by putting on the air a new local information program, with national and international headlines, named 19/20 created and presented by Henri Sannier with Ghislaine Ottenheimer. The in-vision announcers also made their appearance the same year.

In 1986, the then government of Jacques Chirac put forward the proposal of privatising one of the three public television companies. The original suggestion was to transform FR3 into a private body, however the final decision was that of TF1. The broadcasting authority at the time, the CNCL, appointed Rene Han to become programme controller of FR3, with the result that the networked programmes took an even more highbrow and cultural focus.

Changes to the schedule included a supplementary Friday night edition of &quot;Thalassa- le magazine de la mer&quot; whilst an opera was televised every Wednesday night. Popular quiz show &quot;Questions pour un champion&quot; made its broadcasting début in November 1988. &quot;La Classe&quot;, an entertainment programme which replaced &quot;Les Jeux de 20 heures&quot; and followed &quot;19|20&quot;, was also introduced. Having launched without using &quot;speakerines&quot;, the network introduced in-vision announcers in September 1987 and retained live continuity until 1993, a year after TF1 and France 2 had abandoned in-vision presentation.

===Reaffirmation of the public sector (1989–1990)===
At the turn of the decade, the French television landscape which had been previously dominated by the three public stations now consisted of a strong private sector in the form of TF1 and Canal+ and the now-fragmented public sector of &quot;Antenne 2&quot; and &quot;FR3&quot;. In 1990, the State, through the &quot;Conseil Supérieure de l&#x27;Audiovisuel&quot; (CSA), decided to merge the separate public entities into a new corporation.

At the same time, FR3 was already closing down on Saturday afternoons to allow nine hours of airtime to the educational station La Sept, airing from 3 pm to midnight. The arrangement continued until 1992 when the launch of the Franco-German network Arte led to the broadcaster&#x27;s demise. On FR3 itself, the network aired current affairs programming on Saturday mornings including &quot;Continentales&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Eurojournal&quot;, both presented by Alex Taylor.

===The public reunification (1990–2009)===
On 7 September 1992, FR3 and Antenne 2 were reunified in the new France Télévisions entity and rebranded as &quot;France 3&quot; and &quot;France 2&quot; respectively. Their logos match to the French flag like TF1. In 1998, &quot;France 3&quot; partnered with TPS to launch a satellite station called &quot;Régions&quot;.

Between 2000 and 2005, La Cinquième (now France 5), RFO (along with RFOsat, then France Ô) and France 4 joined France 2 and &quot;France 3&quot; under the France Télévisions corporate identity.

Under the direction of &quot;France Télévisions&quot; chairman Patrick de Carolis and director of channels Patrice Duhamel, October 2006 saw the introduction of a new daily cultural programme called &quot;Ce soir (ou jamais!)&quot; presented by Frederic Taddei, marking a new, more cultural focus to the network&#x27;s programming. The late night news programme &quot;Soir 3&quot; was given a new, fixed timeslot of 11 pm.

===2009–present===
On 5 January 2009, all on-air advertising on France Télévisions, (including France 3) between 20:00 and 06:00 was eliminated, meaning the traditional start of primetime viewing in France of 20:45 was brought forward by ten minutes to 20:35.

With the establishment of digital terrestrial television, France 3 has seen its national audience share down to under 10%, behind M6.

In October 2023, France Télévisions and Radio France announced that they would unify their regional services under the brand &quot;Ici&quot;, encompassing the France Bleu radio network and France 3. This transition began with the two networks adopting a shared digital platform under the Ici branding, and the rebranding of France 3 news bulletins under the &quot;Ici&quot; title (including the new morning show &quot;Ici Matin&quot;, which is simulcast with France Bleu). The Ici branding began to be promoted on-air in late-August 2024; news programmes simulcast with France Bleu will begin to carry the Ici logo beginning in November, and France 3 will be fully rebranded as Ici in January 2025. The rebranding has faced criticism over the planned discontinuation of the historic France 3 brand, including protests by a union representing France Télévisions&#x27; employees.

== Branding ==

=== Idents ===

==== 1992–2003 ====
On 7 September 1992, the new France 3 channel was given a logo designed by the Gédéon agency: the number &quot;3&quot; in blue with the word &quot;France&quot; inscribed in the upper part of the number. The jingles and trailers divide the screen into three equal horizontal bands, the upper two of which display the natural landscapes of France. This dressing remained on the air for eight years, the landscapes evolving over the seasons and the years. Only the trailers changed in 1998 to show animals and plants in extreme close-up. On 2 October 2000, the dressing develops smoothly: the three horizontal bands are no longer the same size (the one in the middle is smaller) and the landscapes are no longer only natural, but also urban.

==== 2003–2018 ====
On 1st September 2003, the France Télévisions group adopted a new visual identity designated by the Gédéon agency. France 3 has a new logo similar to the other channels: a blue trapezium with the number &quot;3&quot; written in white inside along the right side. However, the logo has a particularity: the number &quot;3&quot; is not written with the new font of the group but keeps that of the old logo. On 8 September 2003, the channel changed its look. The commercial jingles feature animals drawn in white pencil coming to life in natural landscapes with ambient music. These evolve with the seasons and on 20 March 2006, the animals were replaced by plants.

On 7 April 2008, the logo of France 3 changed with the addition of a 3D effect. While the 3D logo appears on air, the old 2D formula is still used for the channel&#x27;s print publications. On 5 January 2009, France 3 got a new look designed by the Dream On agency. The advertising idents and jingles depict characters carrying out actions of daily life. To create a visual difference, they are placed in contemplative natural landscapes. On 5 September 2011, France 3 adopted a new look from the Gédéon agency. The screen is divided into 24 boxes representing the 24 regional newsrooms of the channel. Each box contains a different video extract, which juxtaposed form a single image representing a person in an action of daily life. This design is inspired by Dadaism and the work of photographer David Hockney.

France 3 regularly set up temporary covers for events or special periods. Each summer, the channel offered a specific look. In summer 2013, the jingles featured wild animals with human behavior animated in 3D in photo-realistic settings. In 2014 and then 2015, new animals were featured. These idents had a certain public success (in particular the famous marmots, regularly acclaimed) and have been rewarded several times by professionals in the sector. From 31 December 2012, to 13 January 2013, and from 29 June – 11 August 2013, France 3 broadcast jingles designed by the Demoiselles agency to mark its 40th anniversary. A logo was also created based on the old logo of France Régions 3. On 4 January 2016, France 3 put its logo back in 2D. The 3D logo is still a small used.

==== 2018–present ====
On 8 December 2017, France Télévisions unveiled the new logos of its channels, which have been on the air since 29 January 2018.

On 29 January 2018, during a replay of the game (Le Grand Slam), a trailer and the new logo appeared at the end. This new logo is born during a coming next for the Ludo program block. Jingles pubs (Winter version) will appear from regional and local broadcasts such as 9:50 in the morning and Ludo, meanwhile, has new credits, a new look, and a new logo.

=== Logos ===
==Mission==
France 3 is a general entertainment channel whose mission is to deliver domestic and regional programming, offering cultural and educational advantages. Its local and regional vocation has been assured by its new mission statement. (&quot; Elle doit privileger l&#x27;information décentralisée et les événements régionaux &quot;) Translated it reads:
&#x27;It must promote local news and regional events and to introduce and familiarise the different regions of France and Europe and &quot;to give space to our lively spectacles&quot;.&#x27;
==Headquarters==
France 3 was originally based at 13–15 rue Cognacq-Jay in Paris, which housed the television services of the former Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française (ORTF).

Since TF1 became independent from the ORTF, FR3 was based at the Maison de la Radio in the 16th arrondissement of Paris with its editorial base located at 28 Cours Albert 1er in the 8th arrondissement.

In 1998, France 3 moved to a new base at 7 Esplanade Henri de France in the 15th arrondissement. This also houses the rest of France Télévisions&#x27; operations. The headquarters are accessible by taking RER Line C to Boulevard Victor.

==Programming==

France 3 has fewer audience constraints compared to sister channel France 2, with the latter being the flagship public channel. This allows France 3 to concentrate on specialist and cultural programming.

It offered three information sessions per day until 25 August 2019, and offers since 26 August 2019, and the stop of Soir 3 (replaced by the 11 p.m. of France Info) two information sessions per day, which include regional and local news editions. It also offers several weather reports per day.

Every morning, France 3 airs the children&#x27;s programming block &quot;Okoo&quot;. While France 5 broadcasts pre-school programmes, France 3 targets the older age range. &quot;Okoo&quot; airs all day long on France 4.

On 2 September 2020, France Ô ceased to be broadcast, since 31 August 2020, to replace certain missions of the channel, France 3 broadcasts two programs on the overseas territories every morning (O&quot;utre-mer le mag&quot;, O&quot;utre mer l&#x27;info&quot;).

===Newscasts (&quot;Journal télévisé&quot;)===
There are three weekday newscasts broadcast as part of the channel&#x27;s schedule:

==== Current ====

===== &quot;Ici 12/13&quot; =====
 is broadcast every day between 12:00 and 12:50 CET.

A typical edition of &quot;Ici 12/13&quot; consists of regional, national and international news headlines at 12:00 followed by an Outre-Mer bulletin from the studios of RFO Paris at 12:15.

Previously, a 15-minute programme, launched in July 2010 called 18:30 Aujourd&#x27;hui opened the 19/20 news sequence, presenting the leading news stories from France 3&#x27;s regional news bureaux. It was cancelled in September 2011, with the regional round-up moving to the 12/13 news programme.

==== Former ====
===== &quot;Soir/3&quot; =====
&quot;Soir 3&quot;, broadcast every night at 22:30 CET, is the network&#x27;s late night news programme, presented by Francis Letellier (&quot;ad interim&quot;) on weeknights and Sandrine Aramon at weekends.

On 5 January 2009, the programme began to incorporate a 5-minute regional news opt-out as part of a revamp of France 3&#x27;s schedule to accommodate the end of prime-time advertising.

On 26 August 2019, the program was moved to Franceinfo due to cost cutting and was renamed to &quot;&quot;. The concept of the program remains &quot;grand JT du soir de France Télévisions&quot;.

===Entertainment===
One of France 3&#x27;s most well-known programmes is , a recurring soap opera based in the fictional neighbourhood of Mistral, Marseille. The show has garnered critical acclaim within France and commands one of the highest viewing figures for the channel.

Quiz shows make up an important part of the channel&#x27;s schedule. Word and numbers game &quot;Des chiffres et des lettres&quot; and general knowledge show &quot;Questions pour un Champion&quot; both make regular appearances in the daytime.

Other well-known programmes are personality talk show &quot;Vie privée, vie publique&quot;, &quot;(Private life, public life)&quot;, &quot;Thalassa&quot;, a programme about all things concerning the sea, magazine show &quot;Des racines et des ailes&quot; and children&#x27;s science show &quot;C&#x27;est pas sorcier&quot;. Cookery and home-improvement shows also feature, with &quot;Côté Cuisine&quot;, &quot;Côté Jardin&quot; and &quot;A Table!&quot;. Live music shows also feature weekly. &quot;Taratata&quot; focuses on rock music, whilst &quot;Chabada&quot; rediscovers forgotten French pop songs. A selection of these programmes are also broadcast internationally, via TV5Monde.

Another children&#x27;s program is &quot;Les Minikeums&quot;, the first long-running program that introduced the marionettes. Until 1 April 2002, &#x27;, one of the first children&#x27;s programs produced entirely in computer-generated images, and the show presented by Theo and Luna, two virtual characters.

===Acquired programming===
Amongst the acquired programmes screened by France 3, British dramas feature prominently. The popular detective dramas &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot;, &quot;Lewis&quot;, &quot;Inspector George Gently&quot;, and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; are shown and have different title names, such as &quot;Inspecteur Frost&quot;, &quot;Inspecteur Lewis&quot;, and &quot;Inspecteur Barnaby&quot;.

=== Information regarding climate change in weather forecasts ===
In February 2023, 2 state TV channels, France 2 and France 3 have begun to enter information regarding climate change in their weather forecasts. This will make the forecasts 1.5–2 minutes longer. The climate related information will rely on experts. The channels will also provide information about climate change and the ways stopping it to their workers. In France, except in case of breaking news they will ask reporters to take the train instead of a plane.

== Regional structure ==

From its historical origins, the Third Channel has used regional editorial and production centres which were developed since 1963 and owned by the ORTF.

From 1992 to 2010, France 3 had 13 regional directorates: France 3 Alsace, France 3 Aquitaine, France 3 Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France 3 Corse, France 3 Limousin Poitou-Charentes, France 3 Lorraine Champagne-Ardenne, France 3 Méditerranée, France 3 Nord-Pas-de-Calais Picardie, France 3 Normandie, France 3 Ouest, France 3 Paris Île-de-France Centre, France 3 Rhône-Alpes Auvergne, and France 3 Sud. They were associated with 12 so-called &quot;outlying&quot; centers and were supported by several local newsrooms producing television news.

The regional centres are often grouped in two levels – two half-hour news programmes and a short late night bulletin are produced and broadcast each day (in many cases, separate bulletins are produced for various parts of the region). The centres also produce shorter, more localised news bulletins for broadcast within &quot;19|20&quot;. For example, &quot;France 3 Nord Pas-de-Calais Picardie&quot; produces localised bulletins for Côte d&#x27;Opale, Lille Métropole and Picardy. Various sport, features, current affairs and entertainment programming produced for and about the regions are also broadcast.

13 regional stations make up the network. Between them, the stations provide 24 sub-regional services, whose broadcast areas approximately match the 22 former metropolitan régions of France (the exceptions being that Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur and Rhône-Alpes are sub-divided into two). Each sub-regional news service emanates from a distinct centre of production. In addition, the stations provide 42 more localised news opt-outs.

Since 4 January 2010, a new organization of the regional network of France 3 has been implemented as part of the reform of the France Télévisions group into a single company. The network has 24 local branches responsible for producing regional and local programs, particularly news. They are united under four governance hubs that manage finance, human resources, and logistics: France 3 Nord-Est (based in Strasbourg), France 3 Nord-Ouest (based in Rennes); France 3 Sud-Ouest (based in Bordeaux) and France 3 Sud (based in Marseille). Corsica has its territorial management in Ajaccio.

In 2013, regional opt-outs accounted for 9.6% of the France 3 airtime or 3 hours per day. They&#x27;re present in the 12/13 and 19/20 television news, as well as in several time slots of the program schedule: two hours in the morning on weekdays, half an hour on Saturday morning, and one hour in the afternoon, half an hour on Sunday afternoons, and once a month on Fridays in the second half of the evening.

The channel reorganized on 1 January 2017, to adapt to the territorial reform: &quot;We want to double the regional offer of France 3, by 2020&quot;, announced at the end of 2016 Yannick Letranchant, Deputy Director.

On 27 September 2017, the regional and local editions of France 3 went on strike.

From 5 February 2018, one week after the new identity of France Télévisions, the news journals will have new opening credits, new decor, and new opt-outs and hang-ups for the regions and locals of France 3.

Exceptionally, from mid-March to mid-May 2020, all the regional journals were pooled into 11 specific entities to respond to the pooling of regions and reduction of staff in trays due to national confinement: Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes (Alpes, Auvergne, and Rhône-Alpes), Bourgogne-Franche-Comté (Bourgogne and Franche-Comté), Corsica, Grand-Est (Alsace, Champagne-Ardennes, and Lorraine), Hauts-de-France (Nord Pas-de-Calais and Picardie), Ile-de-France, Normandie (combining Caen and Rouen sector, two Normandy editions formerly Basse and Haute Normandy respectively), Nouvelle-Aquitaine (Aquitaine, Limousin, and Poitou-Charentes), Occitanie (Languedoc-Roussillon and Midi-Pyrénées), Provence-Alpes Côte d&#x27;Azur (Provence-Alpes and Côte d&#x27;Azur), and a special entity that does not usually exist called Grand-Ouest (grouping only during periods of pooling the Bretagne editions, Centre-Val-de-Loire and Pays de la Loire). This pooling resumed for 4 weeks from Saturday, 3 April 2021, at noon, thus temporarily eliminating all the usual local editions, as well as the local editions created in 2020 and 2021 (respectively at 11:53 a.m., 6:53 p.m. for local editions on weekdays and 6:30 p.m. on weekdays). Shared information also resumes from Saturday, 8 January 2022, until Sunday, 30 January 2022.

Some news reports sourced from &quot;France 3 Ouest&quot; were aired by Channel Television for the now-defunct weekly news programme &quot;Rendezvous Dimanche&quot;. In Belgium, local programming from &quot;France 3 Nord Pas-de-Calais Picardie&quot; has been known to receive twice the number of viewers than in its intended coverage area.

===Ici 19/20 local opt-outs===
Within the main &quot;Ici 19/20&quot; programming block and depending on where the viewer receives France 3 via terrestrial transmitters, local opt-out bulletins (some live, some pre-recorded) concentrating on specific are aired. The ten-minute opt-outs air at around 1845 CET before the main regional news.

<text>Sire Records (formerly Sire Records Company) is an American record label owned by Warner Music Group and distributed by Warner Records.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The label was founded in 1966 as Sire Productions by Seymour Stein and Richard Gottehrer, each investing ten thousand dollars into the new company. Its early releases, in 1968, were distributed in the US by London Records. From the beginning, Sire introduced underground, progressive British bands to the American market. Early releases included the Climax Blues Band, Barclay James Harvest, Tomorrow, Matthews Southern Comfort and proto-punks The Deviants. 

When distribution by London ended after two years, US distribution was handled by various companies: Polydor Records in 1970 and 1971, during which time Sire&#x27;s famous logo was introduced; by Famous Music from 1972 to 1974, during which time the progressive rock band Focus charted with their 1972 hit &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot;; and by ABC Records, which inherited Sire&#x27;s distribution deal when it acquired Famous Music. Sire was distributed by Phonogram Inc. in Europe from 1974 to 1977. 

In the 70s, Sire released a number of compilation albums, including the 3 volume &quot;History Of British Rock&quot; series, and acts such as The Flamin Groovies, Renaissance, The Turtles, Duane Eddy, the Small Faces, and Del Shannon. Sire had one of its biggest successes when Climax Blues Band reached number 3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in 1977 with &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Get It Right&quot;. Also in 1977, Stein, who had previously worked with the Shangri-Las in the 1960s, convinced the group to reform and return to the studio. But the trio working together again proved to be short-lived and they asked to be let out of their contract; the new songs they had recorded were not released by the label.

===Acquisition by Warner===
In the mid-1970s, Sire transformed itself into a successful independent record label and went on to sign artists from the burgeoning punk rock and new wave scenes, including the Ramones, the Dead Boys, the Undertones, and Talking Heads. Sire returned to major label distribution in 1977 with a new deal with Warner Bros. Records. The following year Warner Bros. and Sire entered negotiations whereby Warner Bros. would purchase Sire Records outright, making Sire one of Warner Bros. subsidiary labels. Over the next several years, Sire saw success in the US and Canada with acts such as the Pretenders, Madonna (their biggest act), Soft Cell, the Cure, Depeche Mode, The Smiths, Martini Ranch and Echo &amp; the Bunnymen. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the label had continued success with a roster that included Ministry, k.d. lang, Ice-T, Seal, and Tommy Page.

In 1994, Sire switched distribution from Warner Bros. Records to sister label Elektra Records, also part of parent company Warner Music Group (WMG). Stein had been appointed president of Elektra Records under Elektra&#x27;s newly appointed CEO Sylvia Rhone, so Stein would also be overseeing distribution of Sire releases by Elektra as well as running Elektra day-to-day. Sire left Elektra distribution in 1997 as it became a stand-alone label. But in 2000, Sire and the US division of London Records were merged to become one label, London-Sire Records. This partnership, however, was dissolved in April 2003, at which point the company went back to being called Sire Records, and it returned to distribution with Warner Bros. Records once again.

In 1998, Sire signed a deal with the band The Tragically Hip to distribute their music outside of Canada.

In 2009, official music videos displayed on the Sire Records website were taken down because of a copyright claim by parent Warner Music Group, after royalty negotiations between WMG and YouTube (which Sire had been using to host the videos) broke down in December 2008. In September 2009, both parties came to terms, with Warner Music restoring its music onto YouTube.

In July 2017, Rani Hancock was named the new president of Sire Records. Label co-founder Seymour Stein remained on as chairman. Hancock had previously been the executive vice president and head of A&amp;R at Island Records. In July 2018, Stein departed from Sire Records after a total of 51 years involved at Sire or its parent WMG.

<doc id="625819" wikidata="Q2477418" url="?curid=625819" title="Catholic Church in Ivory Coast">
<text>The Catholic Church in [[Ivory Coast]] is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the Pope in Rome. Catholicism arrived in Ivory Coast through the arrival of French settlers.

The Catholic Church is the world&#x27;s largest Christian church, and its largest religious grouping. There are an estimated 2.8 million baptised Catholics in Ivory Coast, 17.2% of the population (according to the 2014 Census), in 15 dioceses. There are 2,000 priests and 1,200 men and women in religious orders.

The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace of Yamoussoukro in Yamoussoukro, is the largest church in the world, larger even than St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.
==History==
===Origins===
In 1634, the first missionaries, six Capuchin firars from Saint-Malo, landed at Abiany, today called Assinie. Though they were initially welcomed by the locals, the mission failed as four of the priests died due to fever and the remaining two fled to the Portuguese fort in Axim in 1638.

===Modernity===
In 1961, upon invitation from local Catholics participating at the &quot;International Meetings&quot; at the monastery of Toumliline, the Benedictine established the monastery of St. Marie de Bouake. The Capuchins maintain again a presence in the country since December 1976, and the mission was proclaimed a Custody on 1 January 1984. Bernard Yago became the first cardinal of the country on 2 February 1983 when he was consecrated by Pope John Paul II as Cardinal-Priest of San Crisogono. He was one of the few priests in the Ivory Coast who openly opposed the construction of the gargantuan basilica, modeled on St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Vatican City, built by the former president Félix Houphouët-Boigny in his home village of Yamoussoukro because of the enormous waste of hundreds of millions of dollars, and attempted to persuade Pope John Paul II from consecrating it during his visit to the country.

Due to the presence of around 3,000 Lebanese Maronites, there is also a Maronite parish in Abidjan that was founded in 1954 by the Lebanese Maronite Order. The parish belongs to the Maronite Catholic Eparchy of the Annunciation.

==Organisation==
Within Ivory Coast the hierarchy consists of:

*Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Abidjan
**Roman Catholic Diocese of Agboville
**Roman Catholic Diocese of Grand-Bassam
**Roman Catholic Diocese of Yopougon
*Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bouaké
**Roman Catholic Diocese of Abengourou

<doc id="625830" wikidata="Q694719" url="?curid=625830" title="Right of first refusal">
<text>Right of first refusal (ROFR or RFR) is a contractual right that gives its holder the option to enter a business transaction with the owner of something, according to specified terms, before the owner is entitled to enter into that transaction with a third party. A first refusal right must have at least three parties: the owner, the third party or buyer, and the option holder. In general, the owner must make the same offer to the option holder &quot;before&quot; making the offer to the buyer. The right of first refusal is similar in concept to a call option.

A ROFR can cover almost any sort of asset, including real estate, personal property, a patent license, a screenplay, or an interest in a business. It might also cover business transactions that are not strictly assets, such as the right to enter a joint venture or distribution arrangement. In entertainment, a right of first refusal on a concept or a screenplay would give the holder the right to make that movie first while in real estate, a right of first refusal would create incentive for the tenant to take better care of their leased apartment in case the opportunity to purchase arises in the future. Only if the holder turns it down may the owner then shop it around to other parties.

Because a ROFR is a contract right, the holder&#x27;s remedies for breach are typically limited to recovery of damages. In other words, if the owner sells the asset to a third party without offering the holder the opportunity to purchase it first, the holder can then sue the owner for damages but may have a difficult time obtaining a court order to stop or reverse the sale. However, in some cases, the option becomes a property right that may be used to invalidate an improper sale.

ROFR also arises in visitation agreements/orders in divorce cases. In such cases, a ROFR may require a custodial parent to offer parenting time to the non-custodial parent (rather than having a child supervised by a third party) any time that the custodial parent or their family is unable to exercise their right to parenting time (such as if the custodial parent needs to travel out of town). Under these circumstances a breach may result in a finding of contempt and any remedies for contempt.

An ROFR differs from a Right of First Offer (ROFO, also known as a Right of First Negotiation) in that the ROFO merely obliges the owner to undergo exclusive good faith negotiations with the rights holder before negotiating with other parties. A ROFR is an option to enter a transaction on exact or approximate transaction terms. A ROFO is merely an agreement to negotiate.

==Examples==
ROFR: Abe owns a house and Bo offers to buy that house for $1 million. However, Carl holds a right of first refusal to purchase the house. Therefore, before Abe can sell the house to Bo, he must first offer it to Carl for the $1 million that Bo is willing to buy it for. If Carl accepts, he buys the house instead of Bo. If Carl declines, Bo may now buy the house at the proposed $1 million price.

ROFO: Carl holds a ROFO instead of a ROFR. Before Abe can negotiate a deal with Bo, he must first try to sell the house to Carl on whatever terms Abe is willing to sell. If they reach an agreement, Abe sells the house to Carl. However, if they fail, Abe is free to start fresh negotiations with Bo without any restriction as to price or terms.

==Variations==
The following are all variations on the basic ROFR:

*&quot;Duration&quot;: The ROFR is limited in time. For example, Abe must make the offer to Carl for any proposed sale only in the first five years. After that, the right expires and Abe has no further obligation to Carl.
*&quot;Exceptions&quot; include certain transactions. Abe may sell or transfer the property to a holding company, a trust, family members, etc. without first offering it to Carl. However, the new owners remain subject to the right.
*&quot;Transferability&quot;: Carl may assign his ROFR to Dave. Abe must now offer Dave an option to purchase the property instead of Carl. Not every ROFR is transferable; some are personal to the original holder.
*&quot;Extinguished on first sale&quot;: if Abe sells the property to Bo because Carl declines the right, the property is no longer subject to the right. Bo may resell it free of the ROFR.
*&quot;Extinguished on declined/failed exercise&quot;: if Abe proposes to sell the property to Bo and Carl declines, or if Carl accepts but is unable to complete the transaction, the right is extinguished whether or not Abe ultimately sells the property.
*&quot;Persistent&quot;: in contrast to the above two, in this case, the right runs with the property and binds the new purchaser. If Abe sells the property to Bo, Bo must offer the property to Carl first, just like Abe if Bo wishes to re-sell it.
*&quot;Offer and acceptance terms&quot;: specific deadlines, procedures, and forms may be required. For example, Abe must give Carl a &quot;notice of sale.&quot; Carl has 30 days to accept or reject, with failure to respond counting as rejection. Carl must then close the transaction within that time, or that counts as a failed attempt to exercise.
*&quot;Limited time period to close transaction&quot;: Abe offers the property to Carl under the ROFR, and Carl declines. Abe now has 60 days to close the transaction with Bo. If it cannot close within 60 days, Abe must offer it again to Carl before proceeding further with Bo.
*&quot;Substitute purchaser allowed&quot;: Abe offers the property to Carl, who declines. Abe is then free to sell it to Bo but fails to do so. Abe may sell the property under the same terms to Erin instead without reoffering it to Carl.
*&quot;No pending transaction required&quot;: Abe wishes to sell the house for $1 million but has not yet identified a purchaser. He prepares proposed sales terms and offers it to Carl on those terms. If Carl declines, Abe may then shop around for a purchaser.
*&quot;Slight variations allowed in exercise&quot;: Abe enters an agreement with Bo calling for Bo to put down a 30% down payment, conduct certain inspections, and close the transaction in 20 days. He offers it to Carl at those terms. Carl accepts but is entitled to insist on a 20% down payment and a 30-day closing period.
*&quot;Slight variations allowed in sale&quot;: Abe offers the house for $1 million to Carl, who declines. Abe then enters a transaction with Bo but during the escrow, Bo discovers a flaw in title and several defects. Abe is entitled to discount the price by $20,000 to close the sale with Bo without having to reoffer the house to Carl at $980,000.
*&quot;Continuous&quot;: a continuous right of first refusal can be worded to continue to live, even upon infinite opportunities that are declined.

Many other variations are possible. A fully drafted ROFR addresses all of the types of issues and more, and in the case of valuable or complex transactions it is subject to negotiation and review by business transaction attorneys. However, many ROFR are not completely specified. Even the best drafted ROFR agreements suffer a high risk of dispute and litigation because they are anticipating future transactions and contingencies that are unknowable when the ROFR originates.

==In venture capital==
In venture capital deals, the right of first refusal is a term sheet provision permitting existing investors in a company to accept or refuse the purchase of equity shares offered by the company, before third parties have access to the deal. The main goal of the provision is to allow investors to prevent ownership dilution as the company raises additional capital. Typically, the provision will exempt certain types of shares, such as those in an employee pool, or shares issued to equipment loaners or lessors. Startup companies are advised to attempt negotiating out this right, because it enables existing investors to send stronger (potentially negative) signals to new investors, and consequently drive down the company&#x27;s valuation.

<text>The Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA, &quot;Greta&quot;) is a government agency in the U.S. state of Georgia. It was set up under former governor of Georgia Roy Barnes, in order to address mobility, air quality and land use and how they relate to the transportation needs of metro Atlanta, including both roads and public transit. It came about in large part because the numerous cities and counties in the region could not effectively (or would not at all) work with each other to achieve a comprehensive solution to the area&#x27;s traffic woes, and increasing summertime smog problems.

GRTA&#x27;s jurisdiction encompasses 13 Georgia counties in Metro Atlanta: Cherokee, Clayton, Coweta, Cobb, DeKalb, Douglas, Fayette, Forsyth, Fulton, Gwinnett, Henry, Paulding, and Rockdale.

==&quot;Xpress&quot; Regional Commuter Coach Service==
GRTA, in partnership with 12 metropolitan Atlanta counties, operates &quot;Xpress&quot;, metropolitan Atlanta&#x27;s first truly regional commuter transit bus system. As of February 25, 2013 33 &quot;Xpress&quot; routes are in operation. Unless noted, service is provided by a private operator under contract to GRTA &quot;Xpress&quot;. Service hours are from roughly 5:30 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. weekdays with most service being rush hours only.

<text>Garrigues () is a comarca (county) in Ponent, Catalonia, Spain. Its capital is Les Borges Blanques. Its symbol (on the flag and shield in the right panel) is an olive branch, Garrigues being the center of olive cultivation (most of it without the necessity of irrigation) in all of Catalonia.

==History==
The cave paintings at Roca dels Moros, El Cogul, are the most important vestiges of prehistoric settlement in Garrigues. A Neolithic tomb has been found at Les Borges Blanques. During the Iberian era, the comarca was settled by the Ilergetians. There is documentation also for Roman summer residences and country villas, particularly in the north, but the Roman influence died out soon after.

<doc id="625847" wikidata="Q2161730" url="?curid=625847" title="Roger Hale Sheaffe">
<text>General Sir Roger Hale Sheaffe, 1st Baronet (15 July 1763 – 17 July 1851) was a Loyalist General in the British Army during the War of 1812. He was created a baronet in 1813 and afterwards served as Commander and acting Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada. There is conflicting information to statements regarding his military accomplishments (1812) in the &quot;Letters of Veritas&quot; in and around page 50.

==Early life==
Roger Hale Sheaffe was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the third son and eighth child of Susannah Child (1730–1811), daughter of Susannah Hatch and Thomas Child and William Sheaffe (1705–1771), a graduate of Harvard University who became Deputy Collector of Customs at Boston. Her father was an Englishman of the same family as Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney. He owned considerable property in his native Lincolnshire but emigrated to Boston where he co-founded Trinity Church, in 1733.

One of Sheafe&#x27;s sisters, Margaret, married Robert Livingston, of Clermont Manor, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. Another sister, Susanna, married Captain Ponsonby Molesworth, grandson of Robert Molesworth, 1st Viscount Molesworth. A third sister married Benjamin Clarke Cutler, brother of Mrs Samuel Ward.

Sheaffe was educated at the Boston Latin School with his cousin Sir Isaac Coffin. His father died penniless in 1771 and his mother opened a boarding house to support her 10 children. One of the residents there was Lord Percy, later the 2nd Duke of Northumberland, the leader of the British forces in Boston during the American War of Independence. Lord Percy greatly aided the family during the War and was so struck by the qualities and the leadership potential of Sheaffe that he sent him to a military academy in London. Lord Percy became Sheaffe&#x27;s lifelong friend and benefactor, purchasing his first commission as Ensign in 1778 in the 5th Regiment of Foot. He later purchased a lieutenancy.

==Military career==

Sheaffe served with his regiment in Ireland from 1781 until 1787, when it was posted to Canada. In Detroit and at Fort Niagara, he served under Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe, who had a high opinion of him. He was commissioned Captain in 1795. He first served under Lieutenant Colonel Isaac Brock in the 49th Regiment of Foot in 1798; they served together in the campaign against the Batavian Republic in 1799 and in the Baltic in 1801.

The 49th was posted to Canada in 1802. As Lieutenant Colonel, Sheaffe commanded the garrison at Fort George, where he faced an attempted mutiny. Despite his own notable achievements, Sheaffe was often compared unfavourably with the popular and charismatic Brock. Sheaffe had been Brock&#x27;s second in command prior to their time in Canada, and continued in that role upon their arrival. Shortly after arriving at their new station, a mutiny was attempted by some of Sheaffe&#x27;s men. Brock hurriedly came to the aid of his subordinate, ended the mutiny without conflict, and arrested the perpetrators. They claimed they took their actions directly as a result of Sheaffe&#x27;s belligerence, but were subsequently executed after a court-martial. Brock warned Sheaffe to stop working the men too hard and to stop punishing men harshly for small infractions.

Sheaffe nevertheless attained the rank of Colonel in 1808, and Major General in 1811. This last promotion actually hurt Sheaffe financially, as he transferred from a full-pay commission as Colonel of the 49th to half pay as an unassigned general officer on the staff.

==War of 1812==

Sheaffe returned to Canada from a visit to England in July 1812. The next month, the War of 1812 broke out. Sir George Prevost, the Governor General of Canada and commander in chief of the forces there, appointed Sheaffe to command the troops at Fort George on the Niagara River. While Brock was absent, dealing with an American army at the siege of Detroit, Sheaffe was required by Prevost to negotiate an armistice with the American forces on the opposite side of the river. Prevost may have believed that peace could be negotiated quickly, but by the time the armistice ended, the Americans had been substantially reinforced.

Early on 13 October the Americans began crossing the Niagara at Queenston, a few miles south of Fort George. Brock galloped from Fort George to Queenston, arriving just in time to see the Americans capture the commanding heights and a British heavy gun battery. He sent orders to Sheaffe to bring reinforcements, but before they could arrive he led two frontal assaults against the heights. During the second, he was shot dead. Sheaffe arrived on the battlefield at 2pm. In contrast to Brock&#x27;s actions, he waited for reinforcements before leading his force on a wide detour to the top of the heights, so as to shield them from American artillery. He then meticulously drew up his force before attacking at 4pm. The Americans, terrified of the Mohawk who had also joined the battle, tried to flee but were trapped against the river, and surrendered. One thousand prisoners were taken, for a cost of 50 casualties.

Sheaffe was appointed Lieutenant Governor and commander in Upper Canada in succession to Brock, but was unpopular with the people he was to defend, and often with his own soldiers. During the later months of 1812 he was unable to transact business with the Legislature due to illness and other military commitments, forcing Prevost to make a personal visit to Upper Canada in February 1813.

In April, Sheaffe was present in York, the provincial capital, to deal with the civil authorities. York was weakly defended and Sheaffe had only four companies of regulars, passing through en route to Fort George and other posts. On 27 April, an American force supported by gunboats and other armed vessels attacked. In the Battle of York, Sheaffe&#x27;s outnumbered troops were driven back to the edge of the town. Sheaffe decided to preserve his regulars and ordered a retreat to Kingston, having destroyed the fort and a sloop of war under construction in the dockyard. The militia were left to be taken prisoner, while the town was looted by the Americans and several buildings were set on fire.

Many prominent citizens of Upper Canada denounced Sheaffe&#x27;s conduct at York, and Sir George Prevost relieved Sheaffe of his military and civil appointments in Upper Canada, putting him in charge of the troops in Montreal.

==Subsequent career==
Later in the year, Sheaffe was recalled to Britain. Here he subsequently had a successful military career, being promoted to Lieutenant General in 1821 and full General in 1835.

He and his family lived in Penzance and Worcester, and when he retired he moved to Edinburgh. In the 1830s he is listed as living at 12 Inverleith Row in north Edinburgh.

He died at his home in 36 Melville Street on 17 July 1851, and is buried in New Calton Cemetery, beside his daughters Frances Julia and Agnes Emily.

He had been awarded a baronetcy in January 1813 as a reward for the victory at Queenston Heights, but as none of his children survived him, the title died with him but his coat of arms was also bestowed on his dead brother&#x27;s children in perpetuity.

==Family==
In 1810, at Quebec City, Sheaffe married Margaret, daughter of Isabella Child and John Coffin (1729–1810), a relation of his mother&#x27;s from Boston. Lady Sheaffe&#x27;s sister was the mother of Mrs. Benjamin Joseph Frobisher, half-sister of Mrs. George Hamilton. They had six children, all of whom predeceased their parents:

* Frances Julia Sheaffe, b. 1812 in Canada, d. 1834 in Edinburgh (buried beside him).
* Agnes Isabella Sheaffe, b. 1814 in London, died in infancy.
* Agnes Emily Sheaffe, b. 1817 in Worcester, d. 1832 in Edinburgh (buried beside him).
* Percy Sheaffe, died as a young man.
* Another son and daughter both died in infancy.

His younger brother, William, and his wife Mary, died leaving 4 young children. Roger adopted them as his own and brought them up. The boys joined the army and William arrived in Australia as a lieutenant on a convict ship in 1834 with his wife and baby. Their 2 elder children were left in England to be cared for by Roger and Margaret. All the Australian Sheaffes are descended from William and Rosalie.

==Portrayal on banknotes and stamps==

Jackson has appeared on U.S. banknotes as far back as 1869, and extending into the 21st century. His image has appeared on the $5, $10, $20, and $10,000 note. Most recently, his image has appeared on the U.S. $20 Federal reserve note beginning in 1928. In 2016, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced his goal that by 2020 an image of Harriet Tubman would replace Jackson&#x27;s depiction on the front side of the $20 banknote, and that an image of Jackson would be placed on the reverse side, though the final decision will be made by his successors.

Jackson has appeared on several postage stamps. He first appeared on an 1863 two-cent stamp, which is commonly referred to by collectors as the &quot;Black Jack.&quot;

Andrew Jackson is one of the few American presidents to appear on U.S. Postage more than the usual two or three times, appearing on at least twelve different issues as of 2023. The U.S. Post Office released a postage stamp in his honor 18 years after his death, with the issue of 1863, a 2-cent black issue, commonly referred to by collectors as the &#x27;Black Jack&#x27;. due to the large portraiture of Jackson on its face printed in pitch black. During the American Civil War, the Confederate government issued two Confederate postage stamps bearing Jackson&#x27;s portrait.


==Portrayals on flags==
 The current flag of Jacksonville, adopted by the Jacksonville City Council on 24 February 1976, has a silhouette of Jackson on horseback.

==Popular culture depictions==
Jackson and his wife Rachel were the main subjects of a 1951 historical novel by Irving Stone, &quot;The President&#x27;s Lady&quot;, which told the story of their lives up until Rachel&#x27;s death. The novel was the basis for the 1953 film of the same name starring Charlton Heston as Jackson and Susan Hayward as Rachel.

Jackson has been a supporting character in a number of historical films and television productions. Lionel Barrymore played Jackson in &quot;The Gorgeous Hussy&quot; (1936), a fictionalized biography of Peggy Eaton starring Joan Crawford. &quot;The Buccaneer&quot; (1938), depicting the Battle of New Orleans, included Hugh Sothern as Jackson, and was remade in 1958 with Heston again playing Jackson.
Brian Donlevy played Jackson in the Paramount Pictures 1942 film &quot;The Remarkable Andrew&quot;. Basil Ruysdael played Jackson in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1955 &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; TV miniseries.

Jackson is the protagonist of the comedic historic rock musical &quot;Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson&quot; (2008) with music and lyrics by Michael Friedman and book by Alex Timbers.

<doc id="625853" wikidata="Q4253257" url="?curid=625853" title="Lacedaemonius">
<text>Lacedaemonius () was an Athenian general of the Philaid clan. He served Athens, notably in the naval Battle of Sybota against the Corinthians in 433 BC. 

== Biography ==
Lacedaemonius was the son of Cimon, a pro-Sparta general and Athenian political figure, and Isodice who was the daughter of Euryptolemus I, a cousin of Pericles. He was a grandson of the famous Miltiades IV. An account cited that he had a twin called Oulius. He was also the brother of Miltiades V. 

Lacedaemonius came from Lacedaemon, another name for the city state of Sparta. His father so admired the Spartans that as a sign of goodwill he named his son after their city.  Lacedaemonius was also identified as the &quot;proxenos&quot; of the Spartans in Athens.

Accounts cited Lacedaemonius as one of the Athenian generals sent to aid Corcyra in its conflict with Corinth after an alliance agreement concluded in 433. This is part of the series of events that led to the Peloponnesian War. According to Plutarch, Lacedaemonius sailed with ten ships and was sent forth against his will. Lacedaemonius, who according to Thucydides was sent with 2 other generals: Diotimus (son of Strombichus), and Proteas (son of Epicles), was ordered not to engage with the Corinthians unless they attacked Corcyra. The Athenian fleet joined the Corcyraeans when the Corinthians finally invaded under Xenocleides. 

A view, which had been advanced by Plutarch, held that giving Lacedaemonius command with a meager fleet for his campaign was an insult to the sons of Cimon due their sympathy for Sparta. Modern historians see Lacedaemonius appointment as a political move on the part of Pericles, who wanted to destroy political opposition by cementing his ties with the Cimonians. There are also those who propose that Lacedaemonius appointment, his mission, and the size of his fleet was part of a strategy of &quot;minimal deterrence&quot; against Corinth.

<text>Doonside is a suburb in the metropolis of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Doonside is located west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region. Featherdale Wildlife Park and the Nurragingy Nature Reserve are popular local tourist attractions.

==History==
The traditional owners and early settlement

The Duruk people were once the owners of local land. The area now known as Doonside was named &#x27;Bungarribee&#x27; (Bung meaning the &#x27;creek&#x27; and garribee meaning &#x27;cockatoo&#x27;).

In 1802, Governor Philip Gidley King reserved a large proportion of land for a Government Stock Reserve. For the next twenty years the land was used as grazing land for cattle and sheep by convict herdsmen. In 1822 part of the Government stock run was granted by Governor Thomas Brisbane to Scottish immigrant, Robert Crawford. Robert first named his Milton before renaming it &quot;Hill End&quot;. In 1826 John Crawford purchased land adjacent Hill End fronting Richmond Road which he named &quot;Doonside.&quot; The region had various names, before officially becoming Doonside.

Robert James Crawford (1799–1848) had four children with Mary Campbell (d. 1832): Mary Crawford (b. 1826), Robert Crawford (1827–1906), George Canning Crawford (b. 1828), and Agnes C. Crawford (b. 1831). (Robert Crawford&#x27;s four children&#x27;s names are used today at Crawford Public School as sporting house teams). The elder Robert Crawford married Miss Jones of Bligh Street, Sydney, in 1832.

Robert Crawford (1827–1906) married Victoria Margaret Smyth in 1868. Their son, Robert (1868–1930), born in the same year became a published poet.

Bungarribee House

In 1822 the area south of Hill End (Doonside) was granted to a Scottish-born settler named John Campbell (1771–1827).

The property and house had a series of owners and tenants in the 19th and 20th centuries until acquired by the Commonwealth Overseas Telecommunications Commission (O.T.C.) in 1949.

The newly formed National Trust had been trying to secure a lease from O.T.C. but could not agree, citing unworkable lease conditions. A Local Historian, John Lawson, offered to restore the house but was rejected by O.T.C. The house was demolished in 1958.

Doonside Railway and Station

The western railway arrived with a single line to Rooty Hill opening on 23 December 1861, there was no station official but the rail siding was known as Crawford siding. Doonside Railway Station was officially opened on 27 September 1880. Electric trains arrived at Doonside station in 1955. Edith Crawford, from the founding family and the oldest inhabitant, was privileged to &#x27;cut the ribbon.&#x27; Her death was in 1956.

In 1913, Doonside&#x27;s dark platforms were illuminated only by the train guard&#x27;s lamp. Intending passengers had to signal the driver if they wanted the train to stop so they could board. Toilets were erected on the platform in 1922.

The present station was upgraded in 1955, replacing the original buildings. The design of the station buildings applied the railway Stripped Functionalist style, as was done at other stations between Lidcombe and St. Mary&#x27;s. During World War II, the station was one part of a much larger scheme to increase the tracks to four main lines between Lidcombe and St. Mary&#x27;s to provide maximum track capacity to the American ammunition and general store built at Ropes Creek. Quadruplication was completed in 1981.

A signal box was incorporated into the 1955 building but closed in 1963 when automatic boom gates were provided at an adjacent level crossing, which was removed in 1980. The signal box equipment has been removed.

The pedestrian bridge that provides access to the platforms was built in 1958. Its twin beam construction is typical of 1940s footbridges on the Western line quadruplication. Since 1990, every bridge component, except the steel structure, has been replaced.

Wolkara

The Doonside name was changed briefly in 1921 to an Aboriginal name ‘Wolkara’ When the new railway station was being constructed, At Crawford rail siding. Wolkara was also the name of the post office that opened here in 1921, but in April 1929 it was changed back to Doonside, after local residents protested at the name change.

At the time of World War I

Prior to 1916, the only development at Doonside was confined to the Crawford family. The Crawford homestead and acreage block was on the south side of the railway line facing Doonside Road. Kelburn Crawford&#x27;s daughters house, was between the homestead and Bungarribee. North of the line on the corner of Hillend Road and Doonside Crescent, was a brick cottage owned by the Italian family, Luparno. Opposite was a small gatekeepers cottage.

A brick home, owned by another Crawford daughter, was in Doonside Crescent. Properties fronted Hillend Road and were owned by Crawford children. Another cottage in Hillend Road was owned by the family named Harrison, in-laws to Crawford children. A workman&#x27;s timber cottage was on the hill towards the tileworks&#x27; site.

The only road into Doonside was Doonside Road, running from Western Highway. Hillend Road only went as far as Power Street after which there was a track to Richmond Road ending in a gate. Power Street went to Plumpton with the crossing over Eastern Creek being rough and dangerous in wet weather.

After the war (1914–1918), the company of Porter and Galbraith bought property from Crawford and erected a tileworks (PGH) in an area which is now the suburb of Woodcroft. A soldier&#x27;s settlement of about twenty poultry farms was established between the railway line and Bungarribee Road. Part of this land, during the 1930s depression, became a woman&#x27;s settlement.

Early Doonside

There was no electricity until 1929 and water was drawn from wells. Horse-drawn carts would deliver bread and meat. Blacktown was accessed by train as there were not any buses or schools. Parramatta and Penrith, were the nearest high schools.

A store and post office were opened unofficially in 1926 by Bill Francis on the corner of Hillend Road and Cross Street. For some years his nephew Jack Francis operated the post office on the other side of the railway line but once it was made official it returned to its original site until 1987.

Suburb development

In 1912, twelve hundred acres of the Bungarribee estate were carved into eight to twenty-acre lots. In 1919 Directly south of the station was set aside for returning soldiers. 1923 was the first of many major subdivisions, the Doonside Station Estate subdivision [Hill End Estate] was advertised for those who wished to secure a home or business site. The Subdivision extended from the Station north to Power street. 1931 the Crawford Estate was subdivided from Power Street up to Richmond Road, and again in the 1970s. After the PGH was closed the Suburb of Woodcroft was built on the site in the early 1990s. The suburb of Bungarribee was developed in the 2000s.

==Schools==

Doonside is home to two government run primary schools, Doonside Public School, near the station, and Crawford Public School, on Power Street in the north of the suburb. Not far from Crawford is Doonside Technology High School, a government run high school. There are two non-government schools in Doonside. Mountain View Adventist College, on Doonside Road south of the railway line, is run by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and caters for students from Kindergarten to Year 12. St John Vianneys Primary School is a diocesan Catholic school associated with the neighbouring church, also called St John Vianney&#x27;s

Doonside Public School

A &#x27;Provisional&#x27; school was opened in 1903 but closed due to lack of support. It was reopened again in 1911 for two years. In 1937 Doonside Primary School was opened.

The first application for the school was made to Blacktown Shire Council on 28 May 1934. It was unsuccessful because Council felt that Blacktown School was big enough to accommodate students and that there was a train service from Doonside to Blacktown. In March and November 1935 it was again applied for but declined for the same reasons. But after much consideration, approval was finally given on 14 July 1936 for a public school. An area of 4 acres 3 perches had been resumed for this purpose.
The government Architect prepared plans and invited tenders (quote) for building the school. Mr S W Brown was accepted with the quote of 1,850 pounds. The building was completed and opened on 22 November 1937 with Mr Oscar Swanson as teacher.

The first weeks enrolment was 53 by the end of term there were 58.

1939 saw the number of pupils increase to 94. By 1956 there were 202 and in 1962 the number had reached 600. The numbers continued to grow due to the development of the area as new estates and housing were established.

Doonside Technology High School

The High School was opened in 1964 as Doonside High School. The School became a Technology High School in 1989.

Crawford Public School
Opened 1977

St John Vianneys Primary School

==Crime==

Crime is a major problem in Doonside. Safety is a large concern for residents of Doonside; statistics from the Blacktown City Council show that only 28% of residents in Doonside feel safe walking down their own street, with crime and community safety being ranked as the biggest challenges faced by locals.

Doonside is a hub for many street gangs.

==Recreation==
On the western edge of Doonside lies the Nurragingy Reserve, which is situated in the Western Sydney Regional Parklands. The Reserve is a 90ha park featuring picnic grounds and original bushland. It was established a nature reserve in 1981 and named after Nurragingy, a Darug man given a land grant in the Blacktown area in 1819. Just south of the railway line is the Featherdale Wildlife Park, a private zoo established in 1953 and specialising in Australian native animals and birds.

Across the railway line from Nurragingy is Kareela Reserve, a sporting complex, home to a number of local sporting teams including the Doonside Roos rugby league team, Doonside Cricket Club and Doonside Little Athletics. The Doonside Hawks soccer club, the junior club of former Socceroos Captain Craig Moore, plays out of Glendenning Reserve in neighbouring Glendenning while the Doonside Diamonds Netball Club play all their games (home and away) at the Blacktown City Netball Association complex in Blacktown. All these clubs use maroon and white as their colours.

=== Doonside Junior Rugby League Club ===

The Rugby League Club Doonside Roos was founded in 1967 and its first committee meeting was held at the Doonside Hotel. The Colours of maroon and white and an embolem of a leaping Kangaroo were choosing to represent the club. The first games were played in the season of 1968 at Doonside High School&#x27;s oval until a permanent home ground of Kareela Reserve (Kareela East Reserve) was completed. Games were played on Bert Sanders Reserve near Feathedale Wildlife Park one year due to the amenities at Kareela being destroyed in a fire.

1971 the club won its first premiership.

=== Doonside Cricket Club ===

Doonside Cricket Club was established in 1975. Games are played on Kareela Reserve (Kareela East Reserve).

=== Doonside Hawks Soccer Club ===

<text>Café Tacuba (), stylized as Café Tacvba, is a band from Naucalpan de Juárez, State of Mexico. The group gained popularity in the early 1990s. They were founded in 1989, before they had the current lineup of Rubén Isaac Albarrán Ortega (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Emmanuel del Real Díaz (keyboards, piano, programming, rhythm guitar, melodica, vocals), José Alfredo &quot;Joselo&quot; Rangel Arroyo (lead guitar, vocals), and Enrique &quot;Quique&quot; Rangel Arroyo (bass guitar, electric upright bass, vocals), their friend Roberto Silva played the keyboards for a short period of time. Since the &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; World Tour, Luis &quot;El Children&quot; Ledezma has played the drums in every concert but is not considered an official member of the band, as well as Ramiro Del Real Díaz, who joined the band as a support musician playing the guitar since 2015.

== History ==

=== Formation (1989–90) ===
Previously known as &quot;Alicia ya no vive aquí&quot; (a tribute to Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;), the band took its final name from a coffee shop (el Café de Tacuba) located in downtown Mexico City. The café, which opened in 1912 and had its heyday in the 1940s and 1950s, was representative of the Pachuco scene at the time, something the band would later acknowledge as an influence. The &quot;Café de Tacuba&quot; is still in operation as a coffee shop and restaurant on Tacuba Street, in Mexico City&#x27;s Historic Center. The band changed its name to Café Tacvba (changing the u for a v) to avoid legal issues with the coffee shop.

Singer Rubén Albarran and guitarist José Alfredo Rangel met while studying graphic design at Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. Rangel&#x27;s brother, Enrique, completed the band&#x27;s lineup in 1989. The group began playing music in the garage of a house in their neighborhood, Satélite, an upper-middle-class suburban area in the Naucalpan municipality, of the State of Mexico. Café Tacvba was principally influenced by alternative rock bands of the 1980s such as The Cure, The Clash, The Smiths, and Violent Femmes. Despite their English-language influences, the band members wanted to represent their native culture, so they incorporated Mexican influences into their music. The group began singing primarily in Spanish and changed their name to Café Tacvba.

Café Tacvba went from being a garage band to a concert act in 1989, when they joined the scene surrounding El Hijo del Cuervo, a cultural club in Coyoacán featuring writers and musicians. As they performed in various venues around Mexico City, they were discovered by Argentinian music producer Gustavo Santaolalla, who at the time was producing albums for leading bands of the burgeoning Rock en Español movement of the time. Santaolalla arranged a contract for the band with Warner Music Latina (WEA), with plans to produce its debut album himself. Café Tacvba in turn proceeded to record their first song for commercial release, &quot;Tamales de Iguanita&quot;, which WEA released as part of a Christmas-themed rock en español compilation, &quot;Diciembre 25&quot;, in 1990.

=== Early success (1991–96) ===

The group&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Café Tacvba&quot;, was released in 1992 and was extremely popular in Mexico. The group experimented with many different musical styles, from punk and ska, to electronica and hip hop, to regional Mexican varieties such norteño, bolero, and ranchera. However, the band was taken aback by the stark difference between the sound on the album and group&#x27;s &quot;rawer&quot; live sound, likening the recording to &quot;a pasteurized version of ourselves&quot;. Café Tacvba released five singles from the album – &quot;Maria&quot;, &quot;Rarotonga&quot;, &quot;Las Persianas&quot;, &quot;La Chica Banda&quot; and &quot;Las Batallas&quot; – with a music video filmed for each, with the exception of the latter. &quot;María&quot;, directed by Gustavo Garzón, was nominated for Video of the Year at the Lo Nuestro Awards of 1993.

Two years later the band released a follow-up album, &quot;Re&quot;, in 1994. The singles &quot;La Ingrata&quot; (which had a music video directed by Fernando De Garay), &quot;Las Flores&quot; (which had a music video directed by Carlos Somonte) and &quot;El Ciclón&quot; were also commercially successful. On the album, collaborators included Luis Conte and Alejandra Flores, while unconventional rock instrumentation such as jarana, guitarrón, melodeon, and drum machines were employed. The album&#x27;s mixture of genres such as alternative rock, punk, and metal with traditional Latin American styles helped the group develop a dedicated cult following. During the promotion of the album, the band&#x27;s attendance at the 1995 New Music Seminar in New York helped garner some media attention in the United States.

In 1996 Café Tacvba released &quot;Avalancha de Éxitos&quot;, meaning &quot;Avalanche of Hits&quot;, a covers album in which the band performed songs by other Spanish-speaking artists. The tracks were recorded while the band was in the studio working on &quot;Re&quot; and grew tired of recording new material. &quot;Avalancha de Éxitos&quot; marked Café Tacvba&#x27;s first appearance on Billboard&#x27;s album charts (number 12 on the Latin Pop chart, 28 on Top Latin Albums), and the band commenced an international tour to promote the album. In 1996, the band also contributed to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization performing along with David Byrne. The music video for the single &quot;Como Te Extraño&quot; was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award.

=== &quot;Revés/Yo Soy&quot; (1997–99) ===
In the wake of the group&#x27;s international tour, Café Tacvba withdrew from music for a while. When they returned to work, they gathered in their own studio and spent roughly a half-year working on experimental music that encompassed ambient electronica and musique concrète, as well as collaborative work with the Kronos Quartet, an American string quartet. Santaolalla liked the resulting music and deemed it ready for release. WEA, however, did not like the idea releasing an entirely instrumental album of experimental music, after the group had gained success with their more accessible style of music. In the end, WEA and Café Tacvba reached a compromise: if the band would record a second album of more conventional material, the label would release both as a double-disc package and sell it for the cost of a standard single-disc album.

As promised, the group returned to the studio to record an album of previously written material, and released &quot;Revés/Yo Soy&quot; in 1999. The album was a double-disc set, featuring both the band&#x27;s instrumental music and the newly recorded album. The album is notable for its unconventional packaging style, designed by vocalist Rubén Isaac Albarrán. In addition, the album titles Revés (which translates to &quot;reverse&quot;) and Yo Soy (a palindrome), exemplify the band&#x27;s eccentricity. The album also featured two popular singles, &quot;La Locomotora&quot; and &quot;La Muerte Chiquita&quot;, and a music video for &quot;Revés&quot;, directed by Adolfo Dávila. The album won a Latin Grammy for Best Rock Album.

=== Hiatus and signing with MCA (2000–02) ===
After &quot;Revés/Yo Soy&quot;, the group would not release another album for four years. In the meantime, Café Tacvba contributed recordings to various projects such as the &quot;Amores Perros&quot; (2000) and &quot;Y tu mamá también&quot; (2002) soundtracks as well as the tribute album &quot;El Mas Grande Homenaje a Los Tigres del Norte&quot; (2001), which included a cover of &quot;Futurismo y Tradición&quot;. In addition, guitarists Emmanuel del Real Díaz and Joselo Rangel produced a couple songs for Julieta Venegas: &quot;Me Van a Matar&quot; and &quot;Disco Eterno&quot;. Rangel also began work on a solo album, &quot;Oso&quot;, in 2003, which was produced by Albarrán.

While Café Tacvba pursued these various projects, they were looking for a new recording contract; the WEA relationship had come to an end after a trio of compilations released in 2001: &quot;Tiempo transcurrido: The Best of Café Tacvba&quot;; a videos collection of the same name; and &quot;Lo Esencial de Café Tacvba&quot;, a triple-disc package containing the band&#x27;s first three albums. Maverick Records, Madonna&#x27;s label, reportedly attempted to sign Café Tacvba during this time; however, the band decided ultimately to sign with MCA Records in 2002.

=== &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; (2003–06) ===
When Café Tacvba began work on &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot;, the band took a different approach than in the past. They decided to work with a live drummer, and recruited Victor Indrizzo and Joey Waronker. Secondly, they wanted to work with a couple choice producers besides Santaolalla and Kerpel; they recruited Dave Fridmann and Andrew Weiss. Released in June 2003, &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; was met with commercial and critical success. The album won a Grammys for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album as well as two Latin Grammys for Best Alternative Album and Best Rock Song (&quot;Eres&quot;).

The group toured extensively after the release of &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot;, and released a live album of a performance in front of 20,000 people in Mexico City at El Palacio de los Deportes in October 2004. The album was called &quot;Un Viaje&quot;, and was a double-disc set. After the release of the album, the group took a three-year break from releasing music.

=== &quot;Sino&quot; (2007–2010) ===

In 2007 Café Tacvba returned with a new studio album, &quot;Sino&quot;. The album has been compared to classic rock groups such as The Who and the Beach Boys, a departure from their previous techno and funk-influenced sound. The band also performed on the main stage at Lollapalooza that summer. On September 10, 2008, Café Tacvba became the leading nominee at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2008 with a total of six nominations: Album of the Year and Alternative Music Album, for &quot;Sino&quot;. The lead single &quot;Volver a Comenzar&quot; was shortlisted for Record of the Year and Best Alternative Song, the second single &quot;Esta Vez&quot; received nominations for Best Rock Song and Song of the Year. The band took the record for most Latin Grammys won in one night. The inclusion of the song &quot;Volver a Comenzar&quot; in &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; projected the band internationally.

In 2008, the band collaborated with Puerto Rican duo Calle 13 on the song &quot;No Hay Nadie Como Tú&quot;. The song peaked at number 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Latin Songs and number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Latin Rhythm Airplay.

Formerly graphic design students, Rubén, Joselo and Quique design their own album covers.

=== &quot;El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco&quot; (2012–2015) ===
Emmanuel stated in March 2012 that a new album was planned for release before the end of 2012. &quot;El Objeto Antes Llamado Disco&quot; was released on October 22, 2012. The album was recorded in front of live audiences in Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and the United States. The first single was &quot;De Este Lado del Camino&quot;.

=== &quot;Jei Beibi&quot; (2016–present) ===
Café Tacvba released the single &quot;Un Par de Lugares&quot; in October 2016. On January 1, 2017 they released the single &quot;Futuro&quot;, and on March 10, released another single called &quot;Disolviéndonos&quot; and the next week, the single &quot;Que No&quot; on March 24. With the release came the announcement of a new album, called &quot;Jei Beibi&quot; teased for release on May 5. It was released with the company ONErpm.

== Themes ==
Café Tacvba is also seen as a strong advocate for various causes due to the important social and political messages they discuss in their music. The themes of environmental justice and communal welfare are especially prevalent. In their song &quot;Trópico de Cáncer&quot; (1994), for example, the band references the disaster of San Juan Ixhuatepec, a catastrophic explosion of liquid petroleum gas tanks that killed 500–600 and injured 5000–7000 people on November 19, 1985. In &quot;Trópico de Cáncer,&quot; Café Tacvba calls for a return to indigenous values of nature and community over the industrial capitalism responsible for so much suffering. This theme is apparent in the chorus of the song:  
as well as other sections such as:
== Members ==
=== Rubén Isaac Albarrán Ortega ===
Vocalist and guitar player. Previously, until 2001, he played in an alternative band called &quot;Villa Jardín&quot;. In 2006 he announced his solo debut, &quot;Bienvenido al sueño&quot; (&quot;Welcome to the Dream&quot;), it consists of electronic instruments with Buddhist influences and Prehispanic Mexican which he describes as &quot;música protónica por no limitarlo o estereotiparlo&quot; (&quot;protonic music so as not to limit or stereotype it&quot;).

He is also known as &quot;Juan&quot;, &quot;Cosme&quot;, &quot;Masiosare&quot;, &quot;Anónimo&quot; (&quot;Anonymous&quot;), &quot;Nrü&quot; (pronunciation given as &quot;Dshiu&quot; in Spanish; perhaps intended to be ), &quot;Amparo Tonto Medardo In Lak’ech&quot; or &quot;At Medardo ILK&quot;, &quot;G3&quot;, &quot;Gallo Gasss&quot; (&quot;Gasss Rooster&quot;), &quot;Élfego Buendía&quot;, &quot;Rita Cantalagua&quot;, &quot;Sizu Yantra&quot;, &quot;Ixaya Mazatzin Tleyótl&quot;, &quot;Ixxi Xoo&quot; and now &quot;Cone Cahuitl&quot;. He lived the first four years of his life in Monterrey. Studied at UAM (Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana) where he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Design and Graphic Communication. Rubén, or however he is now known, has always pushed gender norms through provocative lyrics, and the occasional skirt worn on stage at concerts.

In the shows prior to the release of their first album, people would yell &quot;Juan!&quot; (the name of one of the band&#x27;s first underground hits) to Rubén, so he kept the name for the release of the first album. Two years later he got bored and changed it to &quot;Cosme&quot; for the release of &quot;Re&quot;. Since then, he has changed his name for every album and world tour.

In 2010, while on break from Café Tacvba, Rubén Albarrán formed a side project called HopPo! In the Dakota language, &quot;Hoppo&quot; means &quot;Lets Go!&quot; Albarrán briefly toured during the fall of 2010 in South and North America with HopPo!

Hoppo&#x27;s self-titled debut album consists of Latin American folk cover songs, and no original material. This particular type of folk music, also known as Nueva Canción, was originally written in the 1960s and 1970s during a social movement of protest and anti-establishment sentiment by South American singer-songwriters and social activists. The album contains three songs written by Violeta Parra, including &quot;Gracias a la vida&quot;.

=== Emmanuel Del Real ===

Emmanuel &quot;Meme&quot; del Real has been in the band from the moment they took the name Café Tacvba. Since the beginning he has been in charge of the keyboards, acoustic guitar, piano, music programming, vocals, melodeon, and melodica.

For a long time he only sang backup, but since the release of &quot;Re&quot; in 1992, he began singing lead on songs like &quot;El Borrego&quot; (&quot;The Lamb&quot;) or &quot;Pez&quot; (&quot;Fish&quot;), he also began playing the guitar more than before.

On the covers album &quot;Avalancha de Éxitos&quot; he plays guitar on &quot;No Controles&quot; (&quot;Don&#x27;t Control&quot;). Since then he&#x27;s also been known to play the jarana. Del Real has written some of the band&#x27;s biggest hits such as &quot;La Ingrata&quot; (&quot;The Ingrate&quot;), &quot;Las Flores&quot; (&quot;The Flowers&quot;), &quot;Aviéntame&quot; (&quot;Throw Me&quot;) and &quot;Eres&quot; (&quot;You Are&quot;).

He is known in the Mexican electronica scene as &quot;DJ Angustias&quot;; is part of the Noiselab collective; and released a solo album in late 2005. Del Real has also produced songs for many Mexican artists like Julieta Venegas, Natalia Lafourcade, Ely Guerra, and Liquits, among others.

=== José Alfredo Rangel Arroyo ===

José &quot;Joselo&quot; Alfredo Rangel, spent the first 9 years of his life in Minatitlán, Veracruz, until his family moved to Mexico DF where he studied industrial design in the UAM.

During his youth he had various hobbies like comic books and design even though he decided music was his major passion.
While in college he met a person with a peculiar voice and extravagant ideas: Albarrán. They became best friends and with his brother, Enrique &quot;Quique&quot; Rangel and they formed a band called &quot;Alicia Ya No Vive Aquí&quot;.

Later on he started working on a new project called &quot;Cafe Tacuba&quot; with Ruben Albarran on the vocals, Enrique &quot;Quique&quot; Rangel on the bass (contrabajo) and Roberto Silva on the keyboards. Emmanuel del Real took the place of Roberto when he left before the band became famous.

After 13 years with the band Rangel decided to launch a solo side project. He has released two albums: the first, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Oso&quot; (&quot;Bear&quot;), named after Joselo&#x27;s childhood nickname; the second, titled &quot;Lejos&quot; (&quot;Far&quot;) in 2005.

He wrote four books, &quot;CRockónicas Marcianas&quot; (a compilation of chronicles, 2011), the collection od stories O&quot;ne hit wonder&quot; (2015), the novel &quot;Los desesperados&quot; (2018) and &quot;Cuba Stone&quot; (2016), a review of The Rolling Stones&#x27; concert in Cuba, in collaboration with Javier Sinay and Jeremías Gamboa.
=== Enrique Rangel Arroyo ===

 Enrique &quot;Quique&quot; Rangel Arroyo was a designer whose interest in music was influenced by his brother Joselo. He was introduced to Albarrán by Joselo and together, along with Beto Silva, formed &quot;Cafe Tacuba&quot;. He abandoned his career as a designer when he brought the band De Real in the late 80s and they changed their name to Café Tacvba.

He designs album art for other bands and, like De Real, composes melodies for other groups. He is also a member of a side project called &quot;Los Odio&quot;.

=== Luis Ledezma ===
Also known as &quot;El Children&quot;, Ledezma is the band&#x27;s live drummer but is not considered an official band member.

=== Ramiro Del Real Díaz ===
A support musician that has been with the band since 2015 playing guitars, jarana and percussions. He is not considered an official band member.

== Genre ==
Their musical style covers a wide variety of genres, though it is most commonly labeled as Latin Alternative/Rock en Español. Their music has been heavily influenced by Mexico&#x27;s indigenous population and folk music traditions, but also by punk and electronic music and other bands on the Mexico City scene. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of their music is Albarrán&#x27;s nasal voice, which, combined with his impressive lung capacity (as demonstrated on &quot;La Ingrata&quot;, a homage of norteño music), makes for a very distinctive sound. They sing entirely in Spanish but have a significant Anglophone following regardless.

The song &quot;Chilanga Banda&quot; has a hip-hop beat under a stream of Mexico City slang originally written by Jaime López, &quot;María&quot; is a &#x27;bolero&#x27; ballad about a ghost, &quot;El Fin de la Infancia&quot; a brass-heavy &#x27;banda ranchera&#x27; sound that reflects the influence of &#x27;banda sinaloense&#x27;, &quot;Desperté&quot; has a tango-driven melody while &quot;El Borrego&quot; mocks speed metal.

== Discography ==

Every studio album released by the band so far has been produced by Gustavo Santaolalla except for &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; which was produced by Santaloalla, Dave Fridmann (The Flaming Lips, Weezer) and Andrew Weiss (Ween). &quot;Cuatro Caminos&quot; was featured on several Top Albums of 2003 charts, including &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Blender Magazine&quot; and won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album.

<text>Charles Allan Rich (December 14, 1932July 25, 1995) was an American country singer. His eclectic style of music also blended influences from rockabilly, jazz, blues, soul, and gospel.

In the later part of his life, Rich acquired the nickname the Silver Fox. He is perhaps best remembered for a pair of 1973 hits, &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; and &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl&quot;, which topped the U.S. country singles charts as well as the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop singles charts and earned him two Grammy Awards. Rich was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Rich at number 120 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

==Early life==
Rich was born in Colt, Arkansas, to rural cotton farmers. He graduated from Consolidated High School in Forrest City, where he played saxophone in the band. He was strongly influenced by his parents, who were members of the Landmark Missionary Baptist Church; his mother, Helen Rich, played piano in church and his father sang in gospel quartets. A black sharecropper on the family land named C. J. Allen taught Rich blues piano. He enrolled at Arkansas State College on a football scholarship and then after an injury, transferred to the University of Arkansas as a music major. He left after one semester to join the United States Air Force in 1953.

He married Margaret Ann Greene in 1952. While stationed in Enid, Oklahoma, he formed &quot;the Velvetones&quot;, playing jazz and blues and featuring his wife on vocals. When he left the military in 1956, the couple returned to the West Memphis area to farm 500 acres. He also began performing in clubs around the Memphis area, playing both jazz and R&amp;B, and began writing his own material.

==Career==
After recording some demonstration songs for Sam Phillips at Sun Records that Phillips considered &quot;too jazzy&quot; and insufficiently commercial, Rich was given a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis records and told: &quot;Come back when you get that bad.&quot; In a 1992 interview with &quot;Fresh Air&quot; host Terry Gross, Rich himself recalled Bill Justis telling Rich&#x27;s wife those words.

In 1958, Rich became a regular session musician for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Bill Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.

After he began recording for the Sun subsidiary Phillips International Records, his third single was the 1960 Top 30 hit &quot;Lonely Weekends&quot;, with Presley-like vocals. It sold more than one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America. None of his seven follow-up singles was a success, however, though several of the songs became staples in his live set, including &quot;Who Will the Next Fool Be&quot;, &quot;Sittin&#x27; and Thinkin, and &quot;No Headstone on My Grave&quot;. These songs were often recorded by others to varying degrees of success, such as the Bobby Bland version of &quot;Who Will the Next Fool Be&quot;.

Rich&#x27;s career then stalled and he left the struggling Sun label in 1963, signing with Groove, a subsidiary of RCA Victor. His first single for Groove, &quot;Big Boss Man&quot;, was a minor hit, but once again, his Chet Atkins-produced follow-up records all failed. In 1965 he moved to Smash Records, where his new producer, Jerry Kennedy, encouraged him to emphasize his country and rock n&#x27; roll leanings, although Rich considered himself a jazz pianist and had not paid much attention to country music since childhood. His first single for Smash was &quot;Mohair Sam&quot;, an R&amp;B-inflected novelty-rock number written by Dallas Frazier, which became a top 30 pop hit. It has been mentioned in thousands of articles as the song Elvis Presley played on his jukebox during the Beatles&#x27; visit to his home on August 26, 1965. However, once more none of his follow-up singles were successful. Rich again changed labels, moving to Hi Records, where he recorded blue-eyed soul music and straight country, but once more, none of his singles for Hi made a dent on the country or pop charts. One Hi Records track, &quot;Love Is After Me&quot; (1966), belatedly became a white soul favorite in the early 1970s.

===Career peak in the 1970s===
Despite his lack of consistent commercial success, Epic Records signed Rich in 1967, mainly on the recommendation of producer Billy Sherrill. Sherrill helped Rich refashion himself as a Nashville sound balladeer during an era when old rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll artists like Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty were finding a new musical home in the country format. This new &quot;countrypolitan&quot; Rich sound paid off in the summer of 1972, when &quot;I Take It on Home&quot; went to number six on the country charts. The title track from his 1973 album &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; became a number-one country hit early in that year, then crossed over into the top 20 on the pop charts. This time, his follow-up single did not disappoint, as &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl&quot; spent three weeks at the top of the country charts and two weeks at the top of the pop charts. Now that he was established as a country music star, &quot;Behind Closed Doors&quot; won three awards from the Country Music Association that year: Best Male Vocalist, Album of the Year, and Single of the Year. The album was also certified gold. Rich won a Grammy Award for Best Male Country Vocal Performance, and he took home four Academy of Country Music awards. One of RCA Victor&#x27;s several resident songwriters, Marvin Walters, co-wrote for three years with Rich, producing four recordings including the popular &quot;Set Me Free&quot;.

After &quot;The Most Beautiful Girl&quot;, number-one hits came quickly, five songs topping the country charts in 1974 and crossed over to the pop charts: &quot;There Won&#x27;t Be Anymore&quot; (pop number 18), &quot;A Very Special Love Song&quot; (pop number 11), &quot;I Don&#x27;t See Me In Your Eyes Anymore&quot; (pop number 47), &quot;I Love My Friend&quot; (pop number 24), and &quot;She Called Me Baby&quot; (pop number 47). Both RCA Records and Mercury Records (Smash was a subsidiary of Mercury that was absorbed into the main company in 1970) also re-released his previously recorded material from the mid-1960s. All of this success led the CMA to name him Entertainer of the Year in 1974. In the same year he performed the Academy Award-nominated theme song &quot;I Feel Love (Benji&#x27;s Theme)&quot; from the film &quot;Benji&quot;. Rich had three more top-five hits in 1975, but though he was at the peak of his popularity, he began to drink heavily, causing considerable problems off-stage.

==== CMA awards 1975 ====
Rich&#x27;s problematic drinking famously culminated at the CMA awards ceremony for 1975, when he presented the award for Entertainer of the Year while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through the names of the nominees, he clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit fire to the paper with the winner&#x27;s name. He then announced the winner of the award as &quot;My friend Mr. John Denver&quot;. Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound; others speculated that it was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too &quot;pop&quot; and not enough &quot;country&quot;. Many, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich&#x27;s popularity took a dive. 

In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich&#x27;s drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website:I&#x27;ll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. ... So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. ... Primarily he thought it would be funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver.

The slump in Rich&#x27;s career was exacerbated by the fact that his records began to sound increasingly similar: pop-inflected country ballads with overdubbed strings and little jazz or blues. He did not have a top-10 hit again until &quot;Rollin&#x27; With the Flow&quot; went to number one on the country charts (as well as number 32 on the easy listening charts) in 1977. Early the following year, in 1978, he signed with United Artists Records, and throughout that year, he had hits on both Epic and UA. His hits in 1978 included the top-10 hits &quot;Beautiful Woman&quot;, &quot;Puttin&#x27; In Overtime At Home&quot;, and his last number one with &quot;On My Knees&quot;, a duet with Janie Fricke.

===Decline in activity and semi-retirement===

In 1979, Rich had moderate success with his singles, his biggest hit being a version of &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; that entered the country top 20. He appeared as himself in the 1978 Clint Eastwood movie &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;, performing &quot;I&#x27;ll Wake You Up When I Get Home&quot;. This song hit number three on the country charts in 1979 and was the last top-10 country single of his career. In 1980, he switched labels again to Elektra Records and that fall released a number-12 country single, &quot;A Man Just Don&#x27;t Know What a Woman Goes Through&quot;. One more top-40 hit followed, the Gary Stewart song &quot;Are We Dreamin&#x27; the Same Dream&quot; early in 1981. Also in 1981, he had a bit part in the movie &quot;Take This Job and Shove It&quot;, which yielded his last charted single, &quot;You Made It Beautiful&quot;. Rich decided to remove himself from the spotlight, and for over a decade he lived off his investments in semi-retirement, only playing occasional concerts. 

In 1992, Rich emerged from his semi-retirement to release on Sire Records &quot;Pictures and Paintings&quot;, a jazzy album produced by journalist Peter Guralnick. It received positive critical reviews and restored Rich&#x27;s reputation as a musician, but it was his last album. In 2016, a tribute album entitled &quot;Feel Like Going Home: The Songs of Charlie Rich&quot; was released by Memphis International Records. Tom Waits, who was an opening act for Rich in the 1970s, mentions him in the song &quot;Putnam County&quot; from his album &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; with the lyric: &quot;The radio&#x27;s spitting out Charlie Rich... He sure can sing, that son of a bitch.&quot;

==Death==
Charlie Rich and his wife were driving to Florida for a vacation after seeing their son Allan perform with Freddy Fender at Lady Luck Casino in Natchez, Mississippi, when he experienced a bout of severe coughing. After visiting a doctor in St. Francisville, Louisiana, and receiving antibiotics, he continued traveling. They stopped for the night in a motel in Hammond, Louisiana, where Rich died in his sleep on July 25, 1995, at age 62. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism. He was buried in the Memorial Park Cemetery in Memphis, Tennessee.

Margaret Rich died in Germantown, Tennessee, on July 22, 2010, at age 76, and was buried alongside her husband.

<text>Arte (, , ; &#x27; (&#x27;), sometimes stylised in lowercase or uppercase in its logo) is a European public service channel dedicated to culture. It is made up of three separate companies: the Strasbourg-based European Economic Interest Grouping (EEIG) ARTE, plus two member companies acting as editorial and programme production centres, ARTE France in Paris (formerly known as La Sept) and ARTE Deutschland in Baden-Baden (a subsidiary of the two main public German TV networks ARD and ZDF). 

As an international joint venture (an EEIG), its programmes focus on audiences in both countries. Because of this, the channel has two audio tracks and two subtitle tracks, one each in French and German.

80% of Arte&#x27;s programming is provided by its French and German subsidiaries, each making half of the programmes. The remainder is provided by the European subsidiary and the channel&#x27;s European partners. Selected programmes are available with English, Spanish, Polish and Italian subtitles online.

In January 2021, Bruno Patino, President of ARTE France, became President of Arte EEIG whilst Peter Weber, Head of Legal Affairs at ZDF, became Vice President. In the same year, the chairmanship of the General Assembly of ARTE EEIG was taken by Tom Buhrow, President of Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) and Chairman of the German association of public broadcasters ARD. Nicolas Seydoux, President of Gaumont, became Vice-Chairman.

==History==
Arte was initiated as a symbol of Franco-German friendship and had been championed since 1988 by French President François Mitterrand and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. It came to fruition on 2 October 1990, when an Interstate Treaty was signed between France and the German Länder.

Arte began transmissions in 1992, filling frequencies left unused by the demise of La Cinq, the first French commercial television network (created in 1986). The opening night on 30 May 1992 was broadcast live from the Strasbourg Opera House.

Arte started as an evening-only service. In the daytime, its frequencies were shared with other channels. A public channel called &quot;Télé Emploi&quot; occupied the French frequencies for about a month in 1994, before the start of La Cinquième (&quot;now France 5&quot;) in December that year. For viewers in Germany, Arte was assigned a frequency on the Astra 1D satellite in late 1994, and it was eventually shared with Nickelodeon Germany, later replaced by the new public children&#x27;s channel Kika.

In 1996, it started offering an afternoon schedule with reruns for viewers on digital satellite and digital cable. A &quot;proper&quot; afternoon schedule with programmes between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. was introduced on 6 January 2001. The channel eventually got its own analogue frequency on the Astra satellites.

Arte has been broadcasting 24/7 since 2005. In 2007 the online catch-up service ARTE+7 was launched and offers free access to a broad range of programs within seven days of their original transmission.

In October 2020, Arte marked 30 years since the signing of its founding treaty between France and Germany.

==Editorial independence==
, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated ARTE France to be &quot;Independent State Funded Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

==Transmission and reception==
ARTE programmes are available with multi-channel audio: all programmes are broadcast in French and German. In addition, whenever possible the original version is offered with French and German subtitles and the hearing or visually impaired may get subtitles or audio description. Since 2015 a selection of programmes have been available online which include English and Spanish subtitles. Polish was to follow in late 2016.

The channel is widely available in Europe. Both the German and the French versions can be received in nearly all of Europe via satellite Astra1 (19, 2° East) and the French version is also available via Hot Bird (13° East). ARTE is also relayed by all cable networks in Germany and France. It is also available on numerous cable networks in Austria, Belgium, Finland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.

Arte has been broadcast since 2008 in HD in Germany and France. Like the national channels of their own respective countries, the German HDTV version of ARTE broadcasts in 720p50, while the French one broadcasts in 1080i25. Broadcasting Center Europe (BCE), a subsidiary of RTL Group and located in Luxembourg (formerly known as CLT-UFA and before its merger with UFA, the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion), provides most of the technical services for Arte.

In April 2016 Arte co-produced, (with Astra satellite owner, SES) a live Ultra-high-definition television broadcast of the Le Corsaire ballet from the Vienna State Opera. The programme was transmitted free-to-air on the UHD1 demonstration channel from the Astra 19.2°E satellites.

In July 2016, the Italian public broadcaster RAI Com signed a partnership agreement with Arte to collaborate on coproductions and programme acquisitions. 
In November 2016, the Irish public television RTÉ signed a partnership agreement with Arte to produce programmes related to arts, culture and history as well as web content for ARTE Concert and ARTE in English. Arte also has agreements with Yle (Finnish public broadcasting) and Film Fund Luxembourg (a national fund that supports Luxembourgish audiovisual productions).

Arte programmes can be streamed live or watched on catch-up TV for at least 7 and up to 700 days on the arte.tv platform and on ARTE Concert.

===International===
In Africa Arte is broadcast via satellite, cable and MMDS, and in many other countries via the digital service CanalSat Horizons.
Many French-language Arte programmes are also broadcast in Canada on the Ici ARTV cable channel, the majority-owned by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (85%) and Arte itself (15%). The Australian Special Broadcasting Service translates many Arte programmes into English for broadcast on its own television network and overseas. In the United Kingdom, Arte, as well as many of its programmes, are available to watch via Learning on Screen.

==Market share==
Arte usually has more viewers in France than in Germany. In 2015, its share of overall viewing was about 2.2% in France and about 1% in Germany. Before cable and satellite became widely used in France, Arte was available to almost everyone as one of six analogue terrestrial channels. The other five channels were not direct competitors to Arte. In Germany, widespread cable and satellite penetration meant the vast majority of German households had access to about three dozen channels, including several from public broadcasters with content similar to that seen on Arte.

===arte.tv===
arte.tv is the channel&#x27;s streaming service. It is accessible from browsers and Arte apps for smartphones and smart TVs. Arte.tv programmes are organised by theme or genre. They include feature films, documentaries and documentary cinema covering topics such as social affairs, the arts, history, nature and science, series, short and TV films, music and theatre performances, magazine shows, reportage and news, and web-based formats.

Arte&#x27;s first digital effort was called ARTE+7, launched in September 2007. Initial it was a catch-up service, allowing viewers to watch ARTE programmes up to seven days after they were broadcast on television. arte.tv has also been available for streaming in Germany and France since 2012. Most programmes can be streamed from 5 am on the morning of broadcast and remain available on replay for up to 90 days, sometimes longer. Some programmes are made available online ahead of transmission. Most of arte.tv now consists of web-only content.

Arte also has a podcast site, called &quot;Arte Radio&quot;. Most of its programmes are in French.

ARTE Extra is a new feature, launched in HbbTV in 2020. Arte Extra provides four &quot;smart playlists&quot; related to different topics such as society, discovery and music which are put together from programmes available on arte.tv. The playlists can be accessed by pushing the red button on the remote control.

An annual Arte film festival takes place online in December. It promotes the European film d&#x27;auteur scene and presents films of young directors accessible in 45 European countries in ten different languages. Each month, the &quot;ArteKino Selection&quot; offers one film available in six languages on arte.tv.

===ARTE in six languages===
Since November 2015 Arte has been making selected programme content – above all documentaries, magazines and live arts – available online with English and Spanish subtitles. Since November 2016 a selection of programmes have featured Polish subtitles. Italian subtitles have been provided since June 2018. This online service is co-funded by the European Commission, enabling 70% of Europeans to watch ARTE in their native language.

===ARTE Concert===
ARTE Concert (known until 2014 as Arte Live Web) streams a selection of new and recent stage performances. These might be Arte co-productions or recordings by partners, including major venues and independent companies, festivals, and autonomous artists, producers and websites. Genres covered include opera, rock music, theatre, chamber music, jazz and electronic music. Apart from plays and concerts, it also offers backstage reports, exclusive interviews with performers and key figures at various festivals, and extracts from dress rehearsals. The livestreaming platform United We Stream was launched in 2020 in response to the closure of venues due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Every day DJs and concerts are streamed live from empty clubs to audiences around the world in partnership with a wide range of performers. ARTE Concert streams more than 900 live shows and replays a year.

In 2018, Arte launched its online opera season. As part of ARTE Concert, it provides access to new opera productions from various European opera houses by live stream or video on demand in six different languages via subtitles. The 2020/2021 opera season featured 21 opera houses from 12 European countries with both classic and contemporary productions.

===Digital productions===
ARTE produces digital games, for example Bury Me, My Love.

===Former themed platforms===
In 2009, &quot;ARTE Concert&quot; (formerly Arte Live Web) was launched, an online platform providing live broadcasts of festivals and concerts. In 2017, the arte.tv platform absorbed the themed platforms &quot;ARTE Creative&quot;, &quot;ARTE Future&quot;, &quot;ARTE Info&quot; and &quot;ARTE Cinema&quot;, which previously were separate units. &quot;ARTE Concert&quot; is still organised as a separate brand integrated into Arte&#x27;s online architecture.

==Awards==
In the course of the channel&#x27;s history, Arte productions and coproductions have received a number of important film awards, including several Oscars, Palmes d&#x27;Or (Cannes Film Festival), Golden Bears, Golden Lions, Golden Leopards, César Awards for Best Film and Best Documentary Film as well as Lolas in gold for the best film and the best documentary.

In 2016, PRIX EUROPA awarded Arte the &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; in honour of &quot;extraordinary achievements in the European media world&quot;.

<doc id="625864" wikidata="Q211201" url="?curid=625864" title="Soviet (council)">
<text>A soviet (, , ) is a workers&#x27; council that follows a socialist ideology, particularly in the context of the Russian Revolution. Soviets were the main form of government in the Russian SFSR and the Makhnovshchina.

The first soviets were established during the 1905 Revolution in the late Russian Empire. In 1917, following the February Revolution, a state of dual power emerged between the Russian Provisional Government and the soviets. This ended later that year with the October Revolution, during which the Second Congress of Soviets proclaimed itself as the supreme governing body of the country.

Because soviets gave the name to the later Soviet Union, they are frequently associated with the state&#x27;s establishment. However, the term may also refer to any workers&#x27; council that is socialist, such as the Irish soviets. Soviets do not inherently need to adhere to the ideology of the Soviet Union.

==Etymology==
&quot;Soviet&quot; is derived from a Russian word meaning council, assembly, advice, harmony, or concord, and all ultimately deriving from the Proto-Slavic verbal stem of *vět-iti &quot;to inform&quot;, related to the Slavic &quot;věst&quot; (&quot;news&quot;), English &quot;wise&quot;, the root in &quot;ad-vis-or&quot; (which came to English through French), or the Dutch &quot;weten&quot; (&#x27;to know&#x27;; cf. &quot;wetenschap&quot; &#x27;science&#x27;).

The word &quot;sovietnik&quot; means &quot;councillor&quot;, from the Russian word &quot;soviet&quot; plus the Russian suffix denoting an occupation.

A number of organizations in Russian were called &quot;council&quot; ().
For example, in Imperial Russia, the State Council, which functioned from 1810 to 1917, was referred to as a Council of Ministers.

The Polish and Ukrainian word is respectively and , from Middle High German &quot;rāt&quot;. See Rada.

== Russian Empire ==
=== Workers&#x27; councils ===
According to the official historiography of the Soviet Union, the first workers&#x27; council (soviet) formed in May 1905 in Ivanovo (north-east of Moscow) during the 1905 Russian Revolution (&quot;Ivanovsky Soviet&quot;). However, in his memoirs, the Russian anarchist Volin claims that he witnessed the beginnings of the St Petersburg Soviet in January 1905. The Russian workers were largely organized at the turn of the 20th century, leading to a government-sponsored trade-union leadership.

In 1905, as the Russo-Japanese War (1904–1905) increased the strain on Russian industrial production, the workers began to strike and rebel. The soviets represented an autonomous workers&#x27; movement, one that broke free from the government&#x27;s oversight of workers&#x27; unions and played a major role in the 1905 Russian Revolution. Soviets sprang up throughout the industrial centers of Russia, usually organizing meetings at the factory level. These soviets disappeared after the revolution of 1905, but re-emerged under socialist leadership during the revolutions of 1917.

Soviets emerged as inclusive bodies to lead workers, and to organize strikes and to politically and militarily fight the government of Russian empire mainly through direct action, with the primary actors being socialist revolutionaries and anarchists, as Lenin&#x27;s party was a minority. During this time they established minor worker cooperatives, though the operations were minor due to Russian crackdown on leftist organizations.

==Russian Revolution==
The popular organizations which came into existence during the February Revolution were called &quot;Councils of Workmen&#x27;s and Soldiers&#x27; Deputies&quot;. These bodies were supposed to hold things together under the provisional government until the election of a constituent assembly could take place; in a sense, they were vigilance committees designed to guard against counter-revolution. The Petrograd Soviet of 4,000 members was the most important of these, on account of its position in the capital and its influence over the garrison.

At the beginning of the Revolution, these soviets were under control of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, and even the Mensheviks had a larger share of the elected representatives than the Bolsheviks. As World War I continued and the Russians met defeat after defeat, and the provisional government proved inadequate at establishing industrial peace, the Bolsheviks began to grow in support. By degrees, the Bolsheviks dominated with a leadership which demanded &quot;all power to the soviets.&quot;

The Bolsheviks promised the workers a government run by workers&#x27; councils to overthrow the bourgeoisie&#x27;s main government body - the Provisional Government. In October 1917, the provisional government was overthrown, giving all power to the Soviets. John Reed, an American eyewitness to the October Revolution, wrote, &quot;Until February 1918 anybody could vote for delegates to the Soviets. Even had the bourgeoisie organised and demanded representation in the Soviets, they would have been given it. For example, during the regime of the Provisional Government there was bourgeois representation in the Petrograd Soviet – a delegate of the Union of Professional Men which comprised doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc.&quot;

Similarly, Leon Trotsky wrote in &quot;Terrorism and Communism&quot; (1920) that &quot;In Petrograd, in November 1917, we also elected a Commune (Town Council) on the basis of the most democratic voting, without limitations for the bourgeoisie. These elections, being boycotted by the bourgeoisie parties, gave us a crushing majority. The democratically elected Council voluntarily submitted to the Petrograd Soviet... the Soviet Government placed no obstacle in the way of the bourgeois parties; and if the Cadets, the SRs and the Mensheviks, who had their press which was openly calling for the overthrow of the Soviet Government, boycotted the elections, it was only because at that time they still hoped soon to make an end of us with the help of armed force... If the Petrograd bourgeoisie had not boycotted the municipal elections, its representatives would have entered the Petrograd Council. They would have remained there up to the first Social Revolutionary and Cadet rising, after which ... they would probably have been arrested if they did not leave the Council in good time, as at a certain moment did the bourgeois members of the Paris Commune.&quot;

Vladimir Lenin wrote that the soviets were originally politically open and inclusive entities, writing in &quot;The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade Kautsky&quot; (1918) that, &quot;the disenfranchisement of the bourgeoisie is not a necessary and indispensable feature of the dictatorship of the proletariat. And in Russia, the Bolsheviks, who long before October put forward the slogan of proletarian dictatorship, did not say anything in advance about disenfranchising the exploiters. This aspect of the dictatorship did not make its appearance &#x27;according to the plan&#x27; of any particular party; it emerged of itself in the course of the struggle ... even when the Mensheviks (who compromised with the bourgeoisie) still ruled the soviets, the bourgeoisie cut themselves off from the soviets of their own accord, boycotted them, put themselves up in opposition to them and intrigued against them. The soviets arose without any constitution and existed without one for more than a year (from the spring of 1917 to the summer of 1918). The fury of the bourgeoisie against this independent and omnipotent (because it was all-embracing) organisation of the oppressed; the fight, the unscrupulous, self-seeking and sordid fight, the bourgeoisie waged against the soviets; and, lastly, the overt participation of the bourgeoisie (from the Cadets to the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries, from Pavel Milyukov to Alexander Kerensky) in the Kornilov mutinyall this paved the way for the formal exclusion of the bourgeoisie from the Soviets.&quot;

The Bolsheviks and their allies came out with a program called &quot;soviet government&quot;. The soviet system was described as &quot;a higher type of state&quot; and &quot;a higher form of democracy&quot; which would &quot;arouse the masses of the exploited toilers to the task of making new history&quot;. Furthermore, it offered &quot;to the oppressed toiling masses the opportunity to participate actively in the free construction of a new society&quot;. According to Lenin, soviet rule &quot;is nothing else than the organized form of the dictatorship of the proletariat&quot;. A code of rules governing elections to the soviets was framed in March 1918, but the following classes were disqualified to vote: &quot;Those who employ others for profit; those who live on incomes not derived from their own workinterest on capital, industrial enterprises or landed property; private business men, agents, middlemen; monks and priests of all denominations; ex-employees of the old police services and members of the Romanov dynasty; lunatics and criminals.&quot;

With village and factory soviets as a base, there arose a vast pyramid of district, cantonal, county and regional soviets, each with its executive soviet. Over and above these stood the &quot;All-Russian Soviet Congress&quot;, which appointed an &quot;All-Russian Central Executive Committee&quot; of not more than 200 members, which in turn chooses the &quot;Soviet of People&#x27;s Commissaries&quot;the Ministry. Beginning with a minimum of three and maximum of 50 members for smaller communities, the maximum for town soviets was fixed at 1,000 members. The soviet system was seen as an alternative to parliamentary systems for administering republican governments.

==Within the Soviet Union==
As outlined in the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, and successively the 1924 Constitution of the Soviet Union and 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, the Soviets were the basis of government in the USSR. Factory and village Soviets would send delegates to town Soviets, and in turn the town Soviet would send delegates to the regional Soviet, town and regional Soviets elected delegates to the provincial Soviet, provincial Soviets sent delegates to the Soviet of the constituent republic, and the Soviets of the Union Republics sent delegates to the Congress of Soviets of the U.S.S.R. As of 1936, the election of delegates up the pyramid became direct with the creation of the Supreme Soviets.

Local constituents within the factory and village soviet would compile a list of what they want the government to do, and the role of the elected delegates was to carry out the given tasks. Unsatisfactory delegates are liable to recall by majority decision of the electorate: in the 30s, fifteen delegates were so recalled within four years in Moscow alone. There were very few full time administrative workers or state functionaries; instead, many citizens would take part in the day-to-day running of the government. In the 1940s, it was estimated that at any given time there were over a million people participating in the running of the Soviets.

Each Soviet has a variety of committees, parallel to the government departments in the USSR as a whole- public employees aided, advised and ran their relevant committees- for example, teachers would be on education sections, and doctors on healthcare sections:

The Union Republics, Provinces and Town Soviets had jurisdiction to run their own industry, take censuses, employ more doctors, teachers, and nurses, build schools, libraries and hospitals so long as it did not directly conflict with the national policy. More than half of the Union Republic&#x27;s income went towards local grants, and local Soviets were largely allowed to determine how their budget was spent.

Based on the Bolshevik view of the state, the word &quot;soviet&quot; extended its meaning to any overarching body that obtained the authority of a group of soviets. In this sense, individual soviets became part of a federal structure - Communist government bodies at local level and republic level were called &quot;soviets&quot;, and at the top of the hierarchy, the Congress of Soviets became the nominal core of the Union government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), officially formed in December 1922. Successive Soviet Constitutions recognised the leading role of the Communist Party in politics, - the 1936 Constitution deemed it the &quot;leading nucleus of all organisations of workers, whether public or state&quot;.
The soviets were structured as the instruments through which the Party governed the country. Thus the organs of the Communist Party (the highest being the Central Committee) made decisions on state policy, while the soviets acted as a system for public approval of implementing the Party&#x27;s programme.

Later, in the USSR, republics were also called soviets and local-government bodies were named soviet (&quot;sovyet&quot;: council) with an adjective indicating the administrative level, customarily abbreviated: &quot;gorsoviet&quot; (&quot;gorodskoy sovyet&quot;: city council), &quot;raysoviet&quot;/&quot;raisoviet&quot;&#x27; (&quot;rayonny sovyet&quot;: raion council), &quot;selsoviet&quot; (&quot;sel&#x27;sky sovyet&quot;: rural council), &quot;possoviet&quot; (&quot;poselkovy sovyet&quot;: settlement council). In practice deputies in a soviet often worked in standing committees and carried out functions with the help of unpaid volunteers (the &quot;aktiv&quot; - ).

==Post-Communist Russia==
Although English speakers perceive the term as connoting the defunct Soviet Union, the same word is used in Russian for the Federation Council of the post-communist Russian Federal Assembly. Its untranslated name is Сове́т Федера́ции (Sovyet Federatsii).

==Outside Russia==
===Poland===
Workers&#x27; councils, known as &quot;rady delegatów robotniczych&quot; (councils of workers&#x27; delegates) or simply &quot;rady robotnicze&quot; (workers&#x27; councils), were formed in Poland at various times throughout the 20th century. The first known examples occurred during the Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905–1907), part of the 1905 Russian Revolution, wherein workers in Congress Poland took control of factories and sometimes even entire towns until tsarist authorities quelled the rebellion using police and military forces; alongside Central Russia and Latvia, Congress Poland was one of the most active centres of the 1905 of revolution.

In 1918, soviets began popping up all around Poland, which was regaining independence after 123 years of colonial rule. Over 100 workers&#x27; councils operated there in the years 1918–1919, assembling around 500,000 workers and peasants. The most numerous and radical councils were located in Kraśnik, Lublin, Płock, Warsaw, Zamość, and Zagłębie Dąbrowskie. Although some of the &quot;rady&quot; managed to form self-defence units, the councils were dismantled by July 1919 – mostly due to suppression by the Polish government and withdrawal of support from the reformist Polish Socialist Party.

The &quot;rady robotnicze&quot; also appeared in the aftermath of World War II 1944–1947, in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic during the Poznań protests of 1956 and Polish October, in 1970, as well as the strike committees and councils of 1980–1981.

===Germany===
In the wake of World War I, the Social Democrats took power in Bavaria, setting up the People&#x27;s State of Bavaria under the leadership of Kurt Eisner, a popular Jewish writer. Eisner, an eccentric and well known figure in Munich, succeeded in carrying out a bloodless coup with a few hundred men on 7 November 1918, occupying the seat of parliament and government, and proclaiming a republic. He was assassinated three months after, whereupon a short-lived soviet republic was established by the Bavarian workers.

On 1 May 1919, the German Army, along with local Bavarian Freikorps, overthrew the nascent republic, massacring several hundred persons in the process, including many non-Communist. A Social Democratic government was thereupon restored, however, political power passed to the Bavarian right.

The political turmoil of post-war Bavaria was also the political springboard of Hitler&#x27;s political career. Hitler, having returned to Munich in late November 1918, detested the soviet state (he elaborated on his aversion to it in his autobiographical work, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, where he also claimed he once narrowly avoided arrest by the state). After the fall of the soviet administration in Bavaria, Hitler began his &quot;first more or less political activity&quot;, informing a military commission regarding those involved in the short-lived soviet state. This work might have been what ensured his future employment with the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; in Munich as an &quot;educational officer&quot; whose task was combating &quot;dangerous&quot; ideas like communism, pacifism, and democracy among the army&#x27;s ranks (many soldiers had taken part in the German Revolution; in fact it was sparked by mutinous German sailors).

===China===

After the Nanchang uprising, the term was also used by the Chinese Communists in the 1920s taking control in some parts of the country, which were later declared as the Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931. The CSR was China&#x27;s first communist government in a structure that would later evolve into the People&#x27;s Republic of China, but was ultimately wiped out by the Chinese Nationalist forces.

In 1929, Deng Xiaoping led a short-lived soviet in Bama County.

===Elsewhere===
The term soon came to be used outside the former Russian Empire following 1917. The Limerick Soviet was formed in Ireland in 1919 at the beginning of the Irish War of Independence, and sprung up alongside a number of soviets in Ireland. A soviet republic was established in Bavaria on 7 April 1919. In 1920, the &quot;Workers&#x27; Dreadnought&quot; published &quot;A Constitution for British Soviets&quot; in preparation for the launch of the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International). Here the focus was on &quot;household&quot; soviets &quot;[i]n order that mothers and those who are organisers of the family life of the community may be adequately represented.&quot;

<text>According to the Roman foundation myth, Titus Tatius, also called Tatius Sabinus, was king of the Sabines from Cures and joint-ruler of the Kingdom of Rome for several years.

During the reign of Romulus, the first king of Rome, Tatius declared war on Rome in response to the incident known as The Rape of the Sabine Women. After he captured the stronghold atop the Capitoline Hill through the treachery of Tarpeia, the Sabines and Romans fought an epic battle that concluded when the abducted Sabine women intervened to convince the two sides to reconcile and end the war. The two kingdoms were joined and the two kings ruled jointly until Tatius&#x27; murder five years later. The joint kingdom was still called Rome and the citizens of the city were still called Romans, but as a community, they were to be called &quot;Quirites&quot;. The Sabines were integrated into the existing tribes and curies, yet Tatius is not counted as one of the traditional &quot;Seven Kings of Rome&quot;.

Tatius had one daughter, Tatia, who married Numa Pompilius (Romulus&#x27; successor), and one son, who was the ancestor of the patrician &quot;Tatii&quot; family.

==War with Rome==

Dionysius of Halicarnassus ( 60 BC – after 7 BC) reports that after a year of preparation, Rome and the Sabines engaged in several skirmishes and minor engagements before fighting two major battles. Two days after the first battle, the second and final battle between them took place in between the two Roman hills they were occupying. It was an epic contest, featuring multiple reversals wherein each army had, and then lost the upper hand.
At the end of the day, the Sabines retreated to the citadel and the Romans didn&#x27;t pursue them.

Before combat could be resumed, the Sabine women, some in funerary attire, some carrying their children with them, convinced Tatius and Romulus to end the fighting. After a ceasefire, the nations signed a treaty creating a single kingdom under the joint rule of both kings, who reigned together until the death of Tatius.

==Death==

The two kings together oversaw an expansion of Rome and the building of several landmarks, as well as the conquest of Cameria. Their first disagreement came in the sixth year of their reign. Dionysius relates that some of Tatius&#x27; friends had victimized some Laurentii and when the city sent ambassadors to demand justice, Tatius would not allow Romulus to hand over the perpetrators. After the ambassadors had left for home, a group of Sabines waylaid them as they slept. Some escaped and when word got back to Rome, Romulus promptly arrested and surrendered the men responsible – including a member of Tatius&#x27; own family – over to a new group of ambassadors. Tatius followed the group out of the city and freed the accused men by force. Later, while both kings were participating in a sacrifice in Lavinium, he was killed in retribution.

Dionysius also tells the account of Licinius Macer, wherein Tatius was killed when he went alone to try to convince the victims in Lavinium to forgive the crimes committed. When they discovered he had not brought the men responsible with him, as the senate and Romulus had ordered, an angry mob stoned him to death.

==History==
According to Theodor Mommsen, the story of Tatius&#x27; death seems to be a legend explaining the abolition of blood-revenge, presented as-if it were actual history, and that Tatius, who in some respects resembles Remus, is not a historical personage, but the eponymous hero of the religious college called Sodales Titii. The members of the sodales were bound to offer a yearly sacrifice at Tatius&#x27; grave; all of its members were of senatorial rank. In two different books, Tacitus expresses two different opinions, which Mommsen interprets as representing two different traditions:
* That either it was instituted by Tatius himself to preserve a Sabine cult in Rome; or
* That it was instituted by Romulus in honour of Tatius.

The Titii had fallen into abeyance by the end of the republic, but were revived by emperor Augustus and existed to the end of the 2nd century CE. Augustus himself, and the emperor Claudius belonged to the college. Varro mentions him as a king of Rome who enlarged the city and established certain cults, but he may just have been the eponym of the tribe Titiae, or even an invention to serve as a precedent for collegial magistracy.

Gary Forsythe suggests instead, that Titus Tatius could well have been the first real king of Rome, who was later replaced in the accepted narrative by an unhistorical Romulus and Remus, whose names have been construed to derive from that of the city itself.

<doc id="625871" wikidata="Q7370680" url="?curid=625871" title="Rotting Piñata">
<text>Rotting Piñata is the debut studio album by the American rock band Sponge, released on August 2, 1994, through Work Group. Hit singles from this album, such as &quot;Plowed&quot; and
&quot;Molly (16 Candles Down the Drain)&quot;, helped launch the band&#x27;s career and the album was certified gold by the RIAA in July 1995.

==Release==
&quot;Rotting Piñata&quot; is Sponge&#x27;s best selling album, having sold more than 500,000 copies. Although released in August 1994, the album did not enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 until February 1995, following the success of its second single &quot;Plowed&quot;. &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot; peaked at number 58 and remained on the chart for 40 weeks.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rotting Piñata&quot; received mostly positive reviews. However, AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the album was derivative of Pearl Jam or Stone Temple Pilots, with a few good songs but otherwise featuring &quot;half-finished ideas&quot;. &quot;Trouser Press&quot; was more positive about the album, noting &quot;Plowed&quot; and &quot;Molly&quot; as having &quot;catchy hooks and hummable choruses&quot; while also being &quot;colored by murky sonic structures that layer a bit of lead around their listener-friendly cores.&quot; They also wrote &quot;Elsewhere on &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;, Sponge shows an affinity for density and drone— particularly in &#x27;Pennywheels&#x27; and the metallic chug of &#x27;Neenah Menasha&#x27;— while &#x27;Giants&#x27; explores tense instrumental dynamics.&quot;

==Track listing==
All songs written by Sponge (Vinnie Dombroski, Joey Mazzola, Mike Cross, Tim Cross, Jimmy Paluzzi) and produced by Tim Patalan and Sponge.

A special edition included a bonus CD featuring Sponge live at Rock am Ring Nürburgring on June 2, 1995.

==Trivia==
* The title of the album (and song of the same name) came from a conversation the band had regarding controversial punk rock singer GG Allin. Allin promised for several years that he would die by suicide on stage during one of his concerts, but instead died from an accidental drug overdose. The band wondered if Allin would want a posthumous tour instead, where his corpse would be present at the shows and fans would be able to hit or take a whack at it. The band&#x27;s soundman Chris remarked that if that happened, the corpse would be like a rotting piñata.
* Neenah and Menasha are two cities in Wisconsin.
* Track number five, &quot;Miles&quot;, includes the last two lines of Robert Frost&#x27;s poem &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot; (&quot;And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.&quot;).
* Lead vocalist Vinnie Dombroski came up with the lyrics for &quot;Plowed&quot; while shoveling snow in his hometown of Detroit. 
* The vocals for &quot;Molly&quot; were re-recorded for the single release, retitled &quot;Molly (16 Candles Down the Drain)&quot;. The song was partly inspired by a story the band had heard about a 16-year-old girl who fell in love with one of her teachers and attempted suicide after he rejected her advances.

<text>Lewis Addison Armistead (February 18, 1817 – July 5, 1863) was a career United States Army officer who became a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. On July 3, 1863, as part of Pickett&#x27;s Charge during the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead led his brigade to the farthest point reached by Confederate forces during the charge, a point now referred to as the high-water mark of the Confederacy. However, he and his men were overwhelmed, and he was wounded and captured by Union troops. He died in a field hospital two days later.

==Early life==
Armistead, known to friends as &quot;Lo&quot; (for &quot;Lothario&quot;), was born in the home of his great-grandfather, John Wright Stanly, in New Bern, North Carolina, to Walker Keith Armistead and Elizabeth Stanly. He came from an esteemed military family. Armistead was of entirely English descent, and all of his ancestry had been in Virginia since the early 1600s. The first of his ancestors to emigrate to North America was William Armistead from Yorkshire, England. Armistead&#x27;s father was one of five brothers who fought in the War of 1812; another was Major George Armistead, the commander of Fort McHenry during the battle that inspired Francis Scott Key to write &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, which would later become the national anthem of the United States. On his mother&#x27;s side, his grandfather John Stanly was a U.S. Congressman, and his uncle Edward Stanly served as military governor of eastern North Carolina during the Civil War.

Armistead attended the United States Military Academy, joining in 1833 but resigning the same year. He rejoined in 1834 but was found deficient and had to repeat his class once more. In 1836 he resigned again following an incident in which he broke a plate over the head of fellow cadet (and future Confederate general) Jubal Early. He was also having academic difficulties, however, particularly in French (a subject of difficulty for many West Point cadets of that era), and some historians cite academic failure as his true reason for leaving the academy.

His influential father managed to obtain for his son a second lieutenant&#x27;s commission in the 6th U.S. Infantry on July 10, 1839, at roughly the time his classmates graduated. He was promoted to first lieutenant on March 30, 1844. Armistead&#x27;s first marriage was to Cecelia Lee Love, a distant cousin of Robert E. Lee, in 1844. They had two children: Walker Keith Armistead and Flora Lee Armistead.

Armistead then served in Fort Towson, Oklahoma and Fort Washita near the Oklahoma border. Serving in the Mexican War, he was appointed brevet captain for Contreras and Churubusco, wounded at Chapultepec, and was appointed a brevet major for Molino del Rey and Chapultepec.

Armistead continued in the Army after the Mexican War, assigned in 1849 to recruiting duty in Kentucky, where he was diagnosed with a severe case of erysipelas, but he later recovered. In April 1850, the Armisteads lost their little girl, Flora Love, at Jefferson Barracks. Armistead was posted to Fort Dodge, but in the winter he had to take his wife Cecelia to Mobile, Alabama, where she died December 12, 1850, from an unknown cause. He returned to Fort Dodge. In 1852 the Armistead family home in Virginia burned, destroying nearly everything. Armistead took leave in October 1852 to go home and help his family. While on leave Armistead married his second wife, the widow Cornelia Taliaferro Jamison, in Alexandria, Virginia, on March 17, 1853. They both went west when Armistead returned to duty shortly thereafter.

The new Armistead family traveled from post to post in Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas. The couple had one child, Lewis B. Armistead, who died on December 6, 1854, and was also buried at Jefferson Barracks next to Flora Lee Armistead. He was promoted to captain on March 3, 1855. His second wife, Cornelia Taliaferro Jamison, died on August 3, 1855, at Fort Riley, Kansas, during a cholera epidemic.

Between 1855 and 1858 Armistead served at posts on the Smoky Hill River in Kansas Territory, Bent&#x27;s Fort, Pole Creek, Laramie River, and Republican Fork of the Kansas River in Nebraska Territory. In 1858, his 6th Infantry Regiment was sent as part of the reinforcements sent to Utah in the aftermath of the Utah War. Not being required there, they were sent to California with the intention of sending them on to Washington Territory. However, a Mohave attack on civilians on the Beale Wagon Road diverted his regiment to the southern deserts along the Colorado River to participate in the Mojave Expedition of 1858–59.

Lt. Col. William Hoffman, at the head of a column of six companies of infantry, two of dragoons, and some artillery, struggled up the Colorado River from Fort Yuma. On April 23, 1859, Colonel Hoffman dictated a peace to the overawed Mohave chiefs, threatening annihilation to the tribe if they did not cease hostilities, make no opposition to the establishment of posts and roads through their country, and allow travel free from their harassment. Hoffman also took some of their leading men or family members hostage. Afterward he left for San Bernardino, taking most of his force with him; others went down river by steamboat or overland to Fort Tejon.

Captain Armistead was left with two infantry companies and the column&#x27;s artillery to garrison Hoffman&#x27;s encampment at Beale&#x27;s Crossing on the east bank of the Colorado River, Camp Colorado. Armistead renamed the post Fort Mojave. In late June 1859 the Mohave hostages escaped from Fort Yuma. Trouble broke out with the Mohave a few weeks later when they stole stock from a mail station that had been established two miles south of Fort Mojave, and attacked it. Mohaves tore up melons planted by the soldiers near the fort, and the soldiers shot a Mohave who was working in a garden. Eventually after a few weeks of aggressive patrolling and skirmishes, Armistead attacked the Mohave who returned fire in a battle between about 50 soldiers and 200 Mohave, resulting in three soldiers wounded. Twenty-three Mohave bodies were found but more were killed and wounded and removed by the Mohave. Following this defeat, the Mohave made a peace, which they kept from then on.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War began, Captain Armistead was in command of the small garrison at the New San Diego Depot in San Diego, which was occupied in 1860. He was a close friend of Winfield Scott Hancock, serving with him as a quartermaster in Los Angeles, before the Civil War. Accounts say that in a farewell party before leaving to join the Confederate army, Armistead told Hancock, &quot;Goodbye; you can never know what this has cost me.&quot;

When the war started, Armistead departed from California to Texas with the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, then traveled east and received a commission as a major, but was quickly promoted to colonel of the 57th Virginia Infantry regiment. He served in the western part of Virginia, but soon returned to the east and the Army of Northern Virginia. He fought as a brigade commander at Seven Pines, and then under General Robert E. Lee in the Seven Days Battles (where he was chosen to spearhead the bloody assault on Malvern Hill), and Second Bull Run. At Antietam, he served as Lee&#x27;s provost marshal, a frustrating job due to the high levels of desertion that plagued the army in that campaign. Then he was a brigade commander in Maj. Gen. George Pickett&#x27;s division at Fredericksburg. Because he was with Lt. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps near Suffolk, Virginia in the spring of 1863, he missed the Battle of Chancellorsville.

In the Battle of Gettysburg, Armistead&#x27;s brigade arrived the evening of July 2, 1863. Armistead was mortally wounded the next day while leading his brigade towards the center of the Union line in Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Armistead led his brigade from the front, waving his hat from the tip of his saber, and reached the stone wall at The Angle, which served as the charge&#x27;s objective. The brigade got farther in the charge than any other, an event sometimes known as the high-water mark of the Confederacy, but it was quickly overwhelmed by a Union counterattack. Armistead was shot three times just after crossing the wall. Union Captain Henry H. Bingham received Armistead&#x27;s personal effects and carried the news to Union Major General Winfield Hancock, Armistead&#x27;s friend from before the war.

Armistead&#x27;s wounds were not believed to be mortal; he had been shot in the fleshy part of the arm and below the knee, and according to the surgeon who tended him, none of the wounds caused bone, artery, or nerve damage. He was then taken to a Union field hospital at the George Spangler Farm where he died two days later. Dr. Daniel Brinton, the chief surgeon at the Union hospital there, had expected Armistead to survive because he characterized the two bullet wounds as not of a &quot;serious character.&quot; He wrote that the death &quot;was not from his wounds directly, but from secondary bacterium, fever and prostration.&quot; 

Lewis Armistead is buried next to his uncle, Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead, commander of the garrison of Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore, at the Old Saint Paul&#x27;s Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

== Legacy ==
Armistead&#x27;s sword was returned to the South at a reunion of Civil War veterans held at Gettysburg in 1906.

His death is memorialized in the Friend to Friend Masonic Memorial located on the Gettysburg Battlefield, dedicated in 1994.

==In popular media==
In &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, the film version of Michael Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, Armistead was portrayed by actor Richard Jordan, who died shortly afterwards. In the film, the meeting between Armistead and Bingham at the High Water Mark was altered with Lt. Thomas Chamberlain (portrayed by C. Thomas Howell), brother of Col. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, taking Bingham&#x27;s place. In the original novel and in the movie, Armistead was shot in the chest; in the novel, Armistead dies on the spot, but that is corrected to two days afterward in the movie end titles.

Actor John Prosky depicted Armistead for a special appearance in &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, accompanying Pickett at Fredericksburg.

Armistead is a character in the alternate history novel &quot;&quot; (2003) by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen.

<doc id="625876" wikidata="Q374820" url="?curid=625876" title="Darius (video game)">
<text>is a 1987 horizontal-scrolling shooter arcade game developed and published by Taito. Players control a starship named the Silver Hawk in its mission to destroy the Belser empire before they wipe out the planet Darius. Its gameplay involves traversing through a series of scrolling levels while destroying enemies and collecting power-up icons. It is notable for its unique three-screen panoramic display.

The game was designed by a small team of others led by Junji Yarita. In contrast to other similar games, which feature mechanical or insect-like enemies, &quot;Darius&quot; uses aquatic creatures like fish and crabs for its enemies and screen-filling bosses. Its large arcade cabinet, based on Taito&#x27;s earlier panoramic display game &quot;Laser Grand Prix&quot; (1983), was designed to provide a cinematic atmosphere and stand out from other games at the time. The soundtrack was created by Taito&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot; Zuntata, the majority being composed through a combination of FM synthesis and sampling.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Darius&quot; is a two-dimensional horizontally scrolling shoot &#x27;em up set in a fictional future. Uniquely among shoot &#x27;em ups, the game&#x27;s screen is three times wider than conventional size, and the arcade cabinet uses an arrangement of three screens to accommodate it. The player controls an ornate fighter spacecraft, named the Silver Hawk, and must navigate through scrolling terrain while battling a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles throughout the game&#x27;s stages (referred to as &quot;zones&quot; in the game). The ship&#x27;s arsenal consists of forward-firing missiles, aerial bombs and a protective force field, all of which can be upgraded by power-ups (in the form of large, colored orbs) that are dropped by specially-colored enemies throughout the game&#x27;s zones. When the player reaches the end of a zone, a boss appears, which must be defeated to proceed. Once the boss of a zone is destroyed, the player is given a choice of which zone to play next via a branching path. While there are 28 zones in total, only seven can be played in a single run.

==Plot==
After years of pollution and the depletion of natural resources on Earth, humans decided to search beyond the Solar System for habitable planets to live on. A space program dedicated to this premise eventually found a solar system similar to the Earthling&#x27;s and the space colonists selected a habitable planet they named Darius.

After settling on Darius, the inhabitants learned to start a new life and thrive in both society and technology. However, their peace was disturbed by an armada of malevolent maritime shaped space craft controlled by the Belser Army, a race of humanoid space colony based warrior people who have selected the Darius colonists as their next combatants. The Darius inhabitants&#x27; only line of defense were the Silver Hawk series: single-piloted fighter craft designed for long space travel with the ability to wield different weapons at the same time. Two of the fleet&#x27;s top pilots were selected to defend Darius: Proco and Tiat. Together, the two assigned in thwarting Belser&#x27;s attack on Darius.

==Development==
&quot;Darius&quot; was designed by Junji Yarita, with assistance by planner Akira Fujita and programmer Toru Sugawara. Fujita was interested in creating a shoot&#x27;em up game where the player fought a huge battleship at the end of each stage — as a way to &quot;spice things up&quot; and make it stand out among other similar games, Fujita made the bosses themed around fish and other aquatic creatures. Yarita designed these battleships and created a total of 26 different designs, but time constraints only allowed the development team to use 11 of them in the final game. A single boss took roughly ten days to create. Some of the unused designs made it onto the game&#x27;s promotional material, which was attributed to the art being outsourced to a different company.

The arcade cabinet, designed by Natsuki Hirosawa, uses three individual monitors made to appear seamless via mirror effects. The idea was previously used in Taito&#x27;s earlier games &quot;Wyvern F-O&quot; and &quot;Super Dead Heat&quot;, and was added to give the game a more cinematic presentation and to make it feel more unique compared to other shooting games on the market. A headphone jack and volume dials are also present, as is a speaker system installed beneath the player&#x27;s seat, which is referred to by Taito as a &quot;body sonic&quot; system. This concept was originally meant to be used for the 1983 game &quot;Laser Grand Prix&quot;, but it proved too costly and was scrapped. The enemy names were derived from different types of medicine, alongside names of people within the company spelled backwards. Fujita worked on the stage designs and power-ups himself, which he stated was one of the biggest challenges during development — ship upgrades were originally in the form of small pod-like craft that orbited the player; Fujita disliked this idea and cut it from the game.

The game&#x27;s upbeat soundtrack was composed by Hisayoshi Ogura, the founder of Taito&#x27;s &quot;house band&quot; Zuntata. Ogura wanted the music to convey a sense of a deep, expanded universe, and to make it stand out among other shoot&#x27;em up games at the time. Much of the music was composed via a combination of FM synthesis and sampling, while some was made by the Yokosuka Symphony orchestra group. The song &quot;Captain Neo&quot;, used in the game&#x27;s first zone, was originally used as the main theme for Taito&#x27;s earlier arcade game &quot;Metal Soldier Isaac II&quot;, used as a placeholder track during its presentation at tradeshows — Ogura liked the track for its sense of &quot;overwhelming power&quot;, and decided to keep it in the final version.

==Release==
The arcade game made its debut at London&#x27;s Amusement Trades Exhibition International (ATEI) show in January 1987. In the same year, &quot;Darius&quot; was released for arcades in Japan in February, and in North America in April.

Three PC Engine ports were produced by NEC Avenue for the Japanese market in 1990. &quot;Super Darius&quot; was released for the CD-ROM² System add-on on March 16, followed by &quot;Darius Plus&quot; as an 8-Megabit HuCard version on September 21. &quot;Darius Plus&quot; is the only commercially released HuCard that has enhanced support for the PC Engine SuperGrafx. A third version, &quot;Darius Alpha&quot;, was released as a sweepstakes giveaway and was limited to only 800 copies. &quot;Darius Alpha&quot; is an alternate version of &quot;Darius Plus&quot; where the player fights only the bosses. Like &quot;Darius Plus&quot;, it has enhanced support for the SuperGrafx. All three PC Engine versions were developed by Bits Laboratory. During the same year, a home computer version of the game titled &quot;Darius+&quot; (unrelated to the similarly titled PC Engine port) was developed and published by The Edge for the Amiga, Atari ST and ZX Spectrum in Europe. In 2002, PCCW ported the game to the Game Boy Advance&quot; in Japan as &quot;Darius R&quot;.

In August 2016 the original arcade version was re-released for PlayStation 4 in Japan and other Asian PS-Stores. The port was made by Hamster Corporation and is part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; on PlayStation 4. &quot;Darius R&quot;, a remake of the first &quot;Darius&quot; game with some different tunes and a fewer number of stages, was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2002. While never originally ported to the Sega Genesis, a port of the game by M2 is featured on the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole. An expanded version titled &quot;Darius Extra Version&quot; was released for the Sega Mega Drive.

==Reception==

In April 1987, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Darius&quot; as being the most popular upright arcade unit in Japan at the time. It went on to be the third highest-grossing large arcade game of 1987 in Japan.

<doc id="625884" wikidata="Q2261955" url="?curid=625884" title="Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>The Master is a fictional character on the action-horror/fantasy television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; (1997–2003). He is a centuries-old vampire portrayed by Mark Metcalf, determined to open the portal to hell below Sunnydale High School in the fictional town of Sunnydale. The Master is the first season&#x27;s Big Bad (overarching villain).

The Master has been entombed beneath Sunnydale for 60 years as the patriarch of a cult posed opposite Buffy. He is devoted to the vampire race&#x27;s purpose to eradicate humanity and to fulfilling a prophecy that states he will kill the Slayer in the late 20th century.

==Creation and casting==

&quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; was originally conceived from a 1992 feature film that pitched Buffy against a similar villain controlling vampires below Los Angeles. Disappointed by the final film, screenwriter and series creator Joss Whedon reworked his script into a television series more in line with his original vision. He and the staff writers employ horror elements in the series to represent real-life conflicts for the adolescent characters, while frequently undercutting the horror aspect of the show with comedy. Sunnydale High School is situated atop a portal to hell called a Hellmouth, which Whedon uses to symbolize the high-school-as-hell experience. Pragmatically, Whedon admitted that placing the high school on a Hellmouth allows the writers to confront the main characters with an endless array of evil creatures.

Veteran character actor Mark Metcalf appeared in heavy prosthetic make-up for the role of the Master, belying his iconic performance in the film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978) as Douglas C. Neidermeyer, a strident rule-following ROTC officer (and the associated role in Twisted Sister&#x27;s &quot;We&#x27;re Not Going to Take It&quot; music video). In 2011, Metcalf acknowledged that his &quot;Animal House&quot; role would probably live much longer than he, but also recognized his roles on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;—where he plays a similarly named character called &quot;Maestro&quot;—and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as his favorites. Many actors auditioned for the part, but Metcalf, according to Whedon, played it with more complexity, bringing a &quot;sly and kind of urbane&quot; sensitivity and a charm to the villainy of the character.

==Appearances==

The Master is first seen in the series premiere &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot;, which was aired immediately before the second episode &quot;The Harvest&quot;, which reveals more of the Master&#x27;s character and backstory. Although the Master&#x27;s identity is never revealed on screen, Joss Whedon wrote in the pilot&#x27;s script that his name was Heinrich Joseph Nest, roughly 600 years old. This contradicts information presented in the first season that indicates The Master predates written history, as is discussed below.

In &quot;Welcome to the Hellmouth&quot; the Master is presented as a vampire king with extraordinary physical and mental powers that grew as he ages but weakened through long isolation and needing to feed on people; he is raised from a pool of blood by his acolyte Luke (Brian Thompson). The head of a cult who worships the ancient pure demons &quot;The Old Ones&quot; called the Order of Aurelius, the Master attempted to open the Hellmouth in 1937, placing himself in a Catholic mission to do so. An earthquake swallowed the mission during the Master&#x27;s attempt, and he has been living in the ruins for 60 years. He is trapped between dimensions, unable to leave his underground lair, so he commands his minions to find people for him to feed off while planning his escape. In times, Sunnydale High School is built over where the mission was 

The Master&#x27;s incarceration underground was a device used by the writers to avoid having Buffy meet him and then thwart his attempts to kill her each week. Whedon was concerned that audiences would consider this implausible and that weekly confrontations would leave no tension for the season finale when Buffy and the Master would finally meet and battle each other.

In &quot;The Harvest&quot;, employing a ritualized dark ceremony which can be used only once in a century, the Master makes Luke his &quot;vessel&quot;: every time Luke feeds, power will be transmitted to the Master. Luke goes to the Bronze, the local nightclub frequented by Buffy and her friends, and begins to feed on the patrons before Buffy — following a delay caused by getting grounded by her mother — can kill him. Although Luke successfully feeds on a couple of victims, Buffy stakes him, thereby leaving the Master contained, robbed of his proxy, and with insufficient power to break the dimensional barrier that confines him underground.

The majority of vampires on the series have a human face that can turn into what Whedon and the characters call &quot;vamp face&quot;. When shown immediately before feeding, the vampire characters transform with prosthetic make-up and computer-generated effects, giving them prominent brows and cheekbones, sharpened yellow teeth, and yellow eyes. Whedon intended to use the vamp face to be able to place vampires around Buffy in different locations — especially at school — to highlight the element of surprise by illustrating that the characters often face friends and peers who appear normal, but have dark sides. Simultaneously, the vamp face shows that Buffy is killing monsters instead of people.

Whedon made a decision to have the Master in permanent vamp face to indicate that he is so ancient he predates humanity. The Master never shows a human face; the make-up specialist conceived him as bat-like, intentionally making him look more like an animal. His facial make-up, bald head, extremely long fingernails, and black costume all refer directly to the 1922 German Expressionist film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, directed by F. W. Murnau. Like the vampire of that film, Count Orlok, the Master lives in a state of furious isolation from which he is desperate to escape. According to author Matthew Pateman, the Master&#x27;s presentation underscores both his great age and his European-ness — he is emphatically Old World. Even so, as a result of his entrapment in the New World, he adapts and shows himself able to incorporate American technology into his plans. He also (perhaps anachronistically) speaks with a modern American accent.

==Religiosity==

In &quot;Never Kill a Boy on the First Date&quot; the Master reads from a formally written Bible-like book of prophecy that foretells the arrival of a powerful warrior enigmatically named &quot;The Anointed One&quot; (Andrew J. Ferchland) who will become the Master&#x27;s &quot;greatest weapon against the Slayer&quot;. The Master sends other acolytes of the Order of Aurelius to bring The Anointed to him, instructing them to give their lives should it become necessary for them to succeed. When Buffy finally encounters him in the season finale, The Anointed One turns out to inhabit the body of a little boy. The Master instructs the boy in the influence of fear (&quot;Nightmares&quot;) and power (&quot;Angel&quot;).

Buffy studies scholars have noted the role religion plays in the series, and have commented on the Master&#x27;s sense of religiosity in particular. With the exception of Angel (David Boreanaz), none of the main characters exhibit any prominent religious views although they observe some religious holidays. Several of the villains in the series, however, are nearly fanatical about religious ritual and custom, the first of which is the Master. The rituals the Master performs to make Luke his vessel are, according to Wendy Love Anderson, an &quot;inversion of Christianity&quot;. The Master attempts to restore the &quot;old ones&quot; and aligns himself with a child while setting up Buffy to be a Christ-like figure. He foretells that when he is able to leave his mystical prison, &quot;the stars themselves will hide&quot;, an aberration of a line from John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, where Satan is musing on his own power. The Master&#x27;s entombment in a house of worship is a convenient vehicle to introduce the character&#x27;s religiosity, but it also represents the way evil is at times allowed to thrive in churches. The unChristian symbolism was intentional on Whedon&#x27;s part, as he was cautious about including such subversive imagery in &quot;The Harvest&quot;; &quot;Buffy&quot; producer David Greenwalt was certain Christian groups would protest the ceremonial aspects of the plot. Gregory Erickson notes that the Master&#x27;s denigration of a Christian cross, what he calls the &quot;two pieces of wood&quot; even while being burned by it, reflects the series&#x27; treatment of Christianity overall and in turn, the American simplification of religion. On &quot;Buffy&quot;, a cross is a weapon, but beyond that is an empty symbol. Christian symbols and rituals traditionally play an integral role in many vampire stories, as in Bram Stoker&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Buffy&quot; downplays their importance.

==Demise==

The Master sends minions to kill Buffy in &quot;Angel&quot;, an episode featuring the origin story of Buffy&#x27;s romantic interest, a vampire with a murderous past who was re-ensouled by a Gypsy tribe as the ultimate punishment; this &quot;curse&quot; has caused him to feel remorse and live the past century in misery and torment. His desire for redemption, as well as his attraction to Buffy, compels him to assist her. She discovers he is a vampire in &quot;Angel&quot; and it is revealed that one of the Master&#x27;s most powerful followers, Darla (Julie Benz), was the vampire who transformed Angel and was his lover for several generations. After the Master allows Darla to destroy the minions who failed to kill Buffy, Darla tries to lure Angel to the Master&#x27;s side, but Angel stakes and kills her, further thwarting the Master&#x27;s plans.

Buffy and the Master finally meet in the season finale &quot;Prophecy Girl&quot;, in which Giles translates a prophecy that states that if she fights the Master, she will die. Buffy overhears Giles discussing it with Angel and tells Giles she refuses to be the Slayer if it means she will die, then begs her mother to go away with her for the weekend. After five students are murdered by more of the Master&#x27;s followers, however, Buffy decides she must fight the Master and is led to his underground lair by The Anointed One; she is wearing a long white dress, bought for a dance she was supposed to attend instead. He quickly hypnotizes her and tells her that &quot;prophecies are tricky things&quot; that don&#x27;t reveal all: had she not come to fight him, he could not rise, as it is her blood which will free him. He bites and drinks from her, then tosses her to the ground face-down in a shallow pool where she drowns. Angel and Buffy&#x27;s friend Xander (Nicholas Brendon), who have disobeyed her wishes and followed her, arrive after the Master has risen. Xander is able to revive Buffy through CPR, thus the prophecy of her death at the Master&#x27;s hands is fulfilled, but its intention thwarted. She becomes stronger as a result of their encounter.

An extension of the Master&#x27;s religiosity is his preoccupation with prophecies. The themes of the first season are destiny and forming an identity separate from childhood: breaking the illusions that the world is safe and actions have no real consequences. Destiny is repeatedly a theme between Buffy and the Master. The entire first season is underscored with prophecies — a narrative device used less frequently in later seasons of the series — that Buffy neglects to fulfill in various ways. Buffy often has prophetic dreams and the Master is nearly obsessed with recounting and confirming written prophecies. Buffy&#x27;s superhuman powers are her birthright. Despite her desire to live a normal life she feels compelled to fulfill her destiny as a Slayer, and the need for her to live up to this responsibility is reinforced by Giles. Buffy, however, subverts these elements to assert her own free will, which is illustrated in the season finale. According to Buffy studies scholar Gregory Stevenson, the Master has such confidence in the prophecy that the Slayer will die that he is unable to comprehend her resurrection by Xander.

When the Master rises, the Hellmouth opens in the floor of the school library where Giles, Buffy&#x27;s friends Willow (Alyson Hannigan), Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter), and a teacher, Jenny Calendar (Robia LaMorte) are present and fighting off the emerging monsters. Buffy finds the Master on the roof of the library watching through the octagonal windows in the ceiling. Incredulous upon her arrival, he tells her she was destined to die in a written prophecy. She replies &quot;What can I say? I flunked the written.&quot; She is now able to resist his attempts to hypnotize her and pushes him through the skylight into the library below, impaling him on a broken wooden table and killing him.

==Later appearances==
Following his death, the Master makes several appearances in the series, and his presence is still palpable in early second season episodes. In the second season premiere Buffy has still not exorcised the trauma she experienced in her confrontation with the Master, and is masking her anxiety by being hostile towards her friends. She has her catharsis by smashing his bones with a sledgehammer. The Anointed One remains alive until killed by a vampire named Spike (James Marsters) in &quot;School Hard&quot;.

In the third season, &quot;The Wish&quot; presents audiences with an alternate reality in Sunnydale: after dating Xander and breaking up, Cordelia expresses to Anyanka (Emma Caulfield), a vengeance demon, a wish to live in a Sunnydale where Buffy never arrived. In this reality the town is overrun with vampires loyal to the successfully risen Master who, in a capitalistic turn, has devised a machine to make an assembly line to bleed humans to feed his followers, thereby freeing them of the need to hunt humans. In this Sunnydale, very powerful vampires Willow and Xander are his favorites. Near the end of the episode, a very different Buffy arrives, friendless and fighting alone, and when she confronts the Master, she falls quickly under his hypnotic powers and is killed when he snaps her neck (again fulfilling the prophecy that in their fight, she will die).

In the seventh season premiere of &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Lessons&quot;, the Master appears once more as a face of the First Evil, a shape-shifting villain and the Big Bad of the final season.

Metcalf also guest-starred on the &quot;Buffy&quot; spinoff series &quot;Angel&quot; in the second season episode &quot;Darla&quot;, which goes into more detail about Darla&#x27;s human life and her transformation into a vampire at the Master&#x27;s hands.

In the canonical comic book series, it is revealed that the Master has been resurrected off-screen by the Seed of Wonder as its guardian at some point after the first season&#x27;s finale. He is eventually killed again by a far more powerful rogue higher power, Twilight.

The Master appears in the first Buffy video game, where he is resurrected by a necromancer as a spirit to act as the leader for the Old One Lybach&#x27;s plot to build a bridge between his Hell dimension and Earth and lead an army of demons to Earth. The Master possesses Angel and uses the remnants of the Order of Aurelias and demons loyal to him to try to build the bridge. He is eventually exorcised from Angel by Buffy and Willow but survives in spirit form to continue on. After Buffy kills the Dreamers, the demons he&#x27;s using to build the bridge, her friends perform a spell to make him corporeal and she is able to kill him once again.

==Influence==

Joss Whedon created Buffy Summers to subvert the dual ideas of female subordination to patriarchy, and authority steeped in tradition, both dynamics well-established in the Master&#x27;s world order. According to Buffy scholars, the Master is a classic villain. Rhonda Wilcox writes, &quot;There could hardly be a nastier incarnation of the patriarchy than the ancient, ugly vampire Master&quot;, and Gregory Stevenson places him in the category of &quot;absolute evil&quot; with the second season&#x27;s Judge (also Brian Thompson), third season&#x27;s Mayor (Harry Groener), and fourth season&#x27;s Adam (George Hertzberg). In contrast, other &quot;Buffy&quot; characters are more morally ambiguous.

The Master is a grand patriarch consumed with hierarchy, order, subservience, and is defined by what is old. Buffy&#x27;s opposition to the Master addresses media tropes found in many horror films where a young, petite blonde woman, up against a male monster, is killed off partway through the film as a result of her own weakness.

The series also highlights the generational divide between the younger characters and the older ones. In particular, the dialogue, termed &quot;Buffyspeak&quot; by some media, frequently makes the younger characters indecipherable to the older ones. The Master speaks with a stylistic formality found in Bible verses. According to Wilcox, Buffy can hardly understand Giles&#x27; language, much less the Master&#x27;s &quot;pompous, quasi-religious remarks&quot;. The entire first season confronts the younger characters with the problems of impending adulthood, which they only begin reconcile in the last episodes of the season.

Each season finale signifies a turning point for the main characters — usually Buffy — and her confronting the Master, according to Stevenson, represents &quot;the end of her childhood illusions of immortality&quot;. The scene is fraught with romantic imagery, with Buffy in a white gown, initially intended to be her party dress. When the Master bites her it is, according to Elisabeth Kirmmer and Shilpa Raval, her sexual initiation: a different take on the young girl dying at the hands of a monster. Kirmmer and Raval write that the &quot;paradigm of Death and the Maiden is replaced by that of the hero who faces death and emerges stronger&quot;. When he tries to hypnotize her on the roof, she is able to resist him and kills him.

Buffy&#x27;s willful behavior and tendency to buck tradition is further underscored by another Slayer who was brought up in the traditional Slayer path by her Watcher. In the mythos of the series, when one Slayer dies, another takes her place somewhere in the world. Buffy&#x27;s brief death activated the Slayer Kendra (Bianca Lawson) in the second season. She is a committed, rule-abiding young woman who does everything authority figures tell her to do. Thus, she is fatally vulnerable to being hypnotized by Drusilla (Juliet Landau), an insane vampire with extraordinary mental abilities, who kills Kendra easily.

<doc id="625890" wikidata="Q7975665" url="?curid=625890" title="Wax Ecstatic">
<text>Wax Ecstatic is the second studio album by American rock band Sponge. It was released on July 2, 1996 through Columbia Records. The album features a more &#x27;70s hard rock-influenced sound compared with the band&#x27;s previous release. It is the band&#x27;s first album with drummer Charlie Grover, and includes the hit singles &quot;Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)&quot; and &quot;Have You Seen Mary&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Wax Ectastic&quot; was originally intended to be a concept album revolving around the death of a drag queen; instead, only two songs on the album address the subject. The band decided against the idea of making a concept album, and instead would incorporate new instrumentation along with a more &#x27;70s hard rock-influenced sound compared to &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;.

==Release==
&quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot; was released in July 1996 and peaked at number 60 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)&quot; and &quot;Have You Seen Mary&quot; were released as the first and second singles from the album, and both received significant airplay on radio and MTV. The songs &quot;I Am Anastasia&quot; and &quot;Silence Is Their Drug&quot; also received radio airplay, but were not officially released as singles. By 1998, the album had sold a quarter of a million copies.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot; received mostly positive reviews. AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine said &quot;In order to grow, the group went back to their beginnings, touching on glam rock, arena rock, blues rock, and jangle pop. Although it reveals &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot; to be somewhat calculating in its approach, &quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot;, ironically, is a far superior album.&quot; &quot;Trouser Press&quot; wrote that the album &quot;is markedly stripped down from the dense fury of &quot;Rotting Piñata&quot;, incorporating new instrumentation (piano, saxophone, cello) and working its way through such rootsy numbers as &#x27;The Drag Queens of Memphis&#x27; and the album-closing &#x27;Velveteen&#x27;.&quot;

At the 1997 Detroit Music Awards, &quot;Wax Ecstatic&quot; won the award for &quot;Outstanding National Rock-Pop Album&quot;, and &quot;Wax Ecstatic (To Sell Angelina)&quot; was nominated for &quot;Outstanding National Rock-Pop Single&quot;.

<doc id="625894" wikidata="Q12963" url="?curid=625894" title="François Bayrou">
<text>François René Jean Lucien Bayrou (; born 25 May 1951) is a French politician who has served as Prime Minister of France since December 2024. He has presided over the European Democratic Party (EDP) since 2004 and the Democratic Movement (MoDem) since 2007. A centrist, he was a candidate in the 2002, 2007 and 2012 presidential elections.

From 1993 to 1997, Bayrou was Minister of National Education in three successive governments. He was also a member of the National Assembly for a seat in Pyrénées-Atlantiques from 1986 to 2012 with brief interruptions and a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) from 1999 to 2002. He has been mayor of Pau since 2014.

It was speculated that Bayrou would be a candidate in the 2017 presidential election, but he decided not to run and instead supported Emmanuel Macron, who – after winning the election – named him Minister of State for Justice in the government headed by Édouard Philippe. On 21 June 2017, he resigned from the government amid an investigation into the MoDem&#x27;s allegedly fraudulent employment of parliamentary assistants, initiated earlier that month. He was cleared of those accusations in 2024.

On , he was appointed as Prime Minister by Emmanuel Macron after Michel Barnier&#x27;s government was brought down by a vote of no confidence.

==Early life==
Bayrou was born on 25 May 1951 in Bordères, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, a village located between Pau and Lourdes. He is the son of farmer Calixte Bayrou (1909–1974), MRP mayor of Bordères from 1947 to 1953, and Emma Sarthou (1917–2009). Bayrou descends from an ancestry of primarily Occitans except from his maternal grandmother&#x27;s side which is Irish.

When Bayrou was in his youth, he developed a stutter which led to him attending speech therapy for seven years. He first went to secondary school in Pau, before transferring to Bordeaux. He studied literature at university, and at the age of 23, sat the &quot;agrégation&quot;, the highest qualifying level for teachers in senior high schools and preparatory classes in France. Around the same time, his father was killed in a tractor accident.

Bayrou married in 1971 Élisabeth Perlant, also known as &quot;Babette&quot;. He and Perlant have five children, Hélène, Marie, Dominique, Calixte and Agnès. The children were raised on the farm where Bayrou was born and where Bayrou currently lives with Perlant.

Prior to embarking on his political career, Bayrou taught history in Béarn in the French Pyrenees. He is the author of several books on politics and history, including one on King Henry IV of France. Bayrou&#x27;s hobby is raising horses. Although a practising Roman Catholic, he strongly supports France&#x27;s system of secularism (French: laïcité).

==Political career==

===First steps in politics: 1982–2002===
In Bayrou&#x27;s youth, he was active in nonviolent movements and followed Gandhi disciple, Lanza del Vasto.

Bayrou, a member of the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS), the Christian-democratic wing of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) confederation, was elected to the General Council of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department in 1982 in the canton of Pau-Sud, then the French National Assembly four years later. After the victory of the RPR/UDF coalition in the 1993 legislative election, he became Education Minister in the cabinet led by Édouard Balladur. In this post, he proposed a reform allowing local authorities to subsidise private schools, which caused massive protests and was quashed by the Constitutional Council.

In 1989, after poor results in both the municipal elections and the European Parliament elections, Bayrou and twelve other centre-right parliamentarians including Philippe Séguin, Michel Noir, Alain Carignon, Étienne Pinte, Michel Barnier, François Fillon, Charles Millon, Dominique Baudis, François d&#x27;Aubert, Philippe de Villiers and Bernard Bosson demanded reform of the system at the RPR and the UDF, criticising the most prominent politicians of these parties including former president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. They called for the formation of a new right-wing party to unite the UDF and the RPR into a single entity. Ideological differences between members of this group led to members leaving, though d&#x27;Estaing endorsed Bayrou to become UDF general secretary in 1991.

Despite supporting Édouard Balladur&#x27;s candidacy in the 1995 presidential election, Bayrou remained Education Minister following Jacques Chirac&#x27;s election and the formation of a new government headed by Alain Juppé. Following the majority for the Plural Left in the 1997 legislative election, Bayrou returned to opposition and became president of the UDF in 1998, transforming it into a unified party rather than a union of smaller parties.

===Positioning of the UDF as a centrist party: 2002–2007===
In 2002 François Bayrou rejected proposals to merge the UDF with the Rally for the Republic (RPR), into a new entity that later became the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP). As a result, many UDF members left to join the UMP.

Bayrou was increasingly critical of the direction taken by the UMP-led government, which he described as out of touch with the average Frenchman. He denounced the &quot;de facto&quot; two-party system, in which the Socialist Party and the RPR (later UMP) alternate. Instead, Bayrou called for a pluralist system in which other parties would also contribute.

On 16 May 2006, Bayrou supported a motion of no confidence sponsored by Socialist deputies calling for the resignation of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin&#x27;s government following the Clearstream affair. As de Villepin&#x27;s UMP had an absolute majority in the National Assembly, the motion failed. Following Bayrou&#x27;s support for this measure, France&#x27;s television authority classified him as a member of the parliamentary opposition for timing purposes. However, after Bayrou protested, he was classified as a member of neither the majority nor the opposition.

===Second presidential campaign: 2007===
Bayrou contested the presidency again in 2007. Most commentators had expected the election to be fought primarily between Nicolas Sarkozy and Ségolène Royal of the Parti Socialiste. However, Bayrou&#x27;s increasing support in polls in February complicated the &quot;Sarko-Ségo&quot; scenario, and led to speculation that the Parti Socialiste candidate would fail to progress to the second round for a second consecutive election, following the defeat of former Prime Minister Lionel Jospin in 2002 by National Front leader Jean Marie Le Pen. Ultimately, Bayrou finished in third place in the election with 18.57% of the vote (6,820,119 votes), behind Sarkozy and Royal, the best performance by the UDF in a presidential election since 1981. Bayrou declared that he could not endorse either Sarkozy or Royal in the second round, although he indicated that Sarkozy was the worse of the two.

===Foundation of the Democratic Movement: 2007–2012===

After the 2007 election, Bayrou intended to form a new centrist party, the Democratic Movement (MoDem). The majority of UDF politicians did not follow him, and instead formed a rival party, the New Centre, which pledged to support an alliance with the UMP. However, most of the UDF&#x27;s grassroots membership remained with Bayrou and joined MoDem. In the subsequent legislative elections in June 2007, MoDem came third with 7.6% of the vote. Although an increase on the UDF share of the poll of 4.9% in the 2002 elections, MoDem won only four seats, including Bayrou&#x27;s own seat. The other parliamentarians elected on the party&#x27;s list were Jean Lassalle, Thierry Benoit (who has since left the party, to join the New Centre) and Abdoulatifou Aly. The establishment of MoDem led to the formal dismantling of the UDF alliance on 30 November.

===Third presidential election: 2012 ===

On 18 August 2011, Bayrou released a book, &quot;2012. Etat d&#x27;urgence&quot;, in which he discussed how and why the economic crisis happened, and outlined the top priorities of his next presidential program: production and education.

François Bayrou confirmed his candidacy for the 2012 presidential election on 25 November 2011, in an interview with journalist Laurence Ferrari on her show &quot;Parole Directe&quot; on TF1.

His supporters included:
* Jean Arthuis, president of the Centrist Alliance, president of the Senate Finance Committee (2002–2011)
* Bernard Bosson, Mayor of Annecy (1977–2007), member of the National Assembly of France for Haute-Savoie (1986–2007)
* Pierre Albertini, Mayor of Rouen
* Anne-Marie Idrac, Secretary of State for International Trade under Nicolas Sarkozy (2008–2010)
* Alain Lambert, Budget Minister (2002–2004)
* Daniel Garrigue, member of the National Assembly of France for Dordogne and former press secretary for Dominique de Villepin
* Jean-François Kahn, author and former director of the newspaper &quot;Marianne&quot;

Bayrou was eliminated in the first round, receiving around half of his vote share from 2007; he endorsed Socialist François Hollande in the runoff.

===2017 presidential election===
On 22 February 2017, Bayrou stated that he would not contest the 2017 presidential election, instead endorsing the centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron of En Marche!. The alliance surprised French political pundits and rival candidates. Part of the agreement was Macron&#x27;s commitment to support a clean government law proposed by Bayrou. Bayrou said that France was &quot;at extreme risk&quot;, requiring an &quot;exceptional response&quot;, adding that the alliance did not mean that MoDem would be subsumed by En Marche!

=== Minister of Justice (2017) ===
On 17 May 2017, Bayrou was appointed as Minister of Justice in the first Philippe government.

&quot;Le Canard enchaîné&quot; published information that Democratic Movement politician Marielle de Sarnez had been paid for work she had not actually done, embroiling Bayrou in a scandal about fictitious jobs. France Info later reported that MoDem had &quot;over a dozen&quot; fictitious jobs in the European Parliament.

Bayrou resigned several days before the 2017 legislative election, only 35 days after he had taken the post. He was found not guilty of those accusations in February 2024.

===Later career===
In September 2020, Bayrou was appointed as high commissioner for planification by Prime minister Jean Castex.

In February 2022, Bayrou created what he calls a &quot;sponsorship bank&quot;, joined by a few hundred local officials, willing to give their signatures to candidates for the presidential election struggling to obtain them, even if they represent a large part of the public according to opinion polls, including far-right candidate Marine Le Pen.

Following the appointment of Gabriel Attal as Prime Minister in January 2024, Bayrou stated that he would not be joining the government; he had been widely expected to return to the cabinet after he was acquitted of fraud charges shortly before.

=== Prime Minister (2024–present) ===
On , following the motion of no confidence that ended Michel Barnier&#x27;s government, Bayrou was appointed as Prime Minister by Emmanuel Macron. The morning of the nomination, Macron reportedly informed Bayrou that he had decided against nominating him, only to revise his position when a furious Bayrou threatened to withdraw his support for the government.

Despite his nomination, Bayrou has pledged to remain in office as Mayor of Pau, similarly to Jacques Chirac, who served simultaneously as Prime Minister and Mayor of Paris from 1986 to 1988. Less than a week after his nomination, he faced criticism after flying to Pau on a presidential Falcon 7X jet to attend a session of the municipal council, rather than visiting Mayotte, which had been heavily affected by Cyclone Chido.

Bayrou&#x27;s government was finalized on 23 December, maintaining the goal Bayrou had set of appointing his ministers before Christmas.

On 30 December 2024, Bayrou visited Mayotte with several government members and announced several emergency measures to rebuild the islands&#x27; infrastructures and to resolve the local crisis.

On 3 February 2025, Bayrou passed his government&#x27;s budget for the year after bypassing a vote in the National Assembly through special constitutional powers. This led to two unsuccessful no-confidence motions being launched against him on 5 February and 10 February.

==Political views ==

Bayrou has been a vocal campaigner on a variety of issues, including reform of the political process, civil liberties, and free software (see DADVSI). During the 2007 presidential election campaign he described the European Union as &quot;the most beautiful construction of all humanity&quot;. He called for France to play a greater role in the European Union&#x27;s affairs, and supports the ratification of a European Constitution, in a more concise and readable form than the one voted down by the French electorate in 2005.

In an interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2007, Bayrou said: &quot;I am a democrat, I am a Clintonian, I am a man of the &#x27;third way&#x27;&quot;. He positioned himself as a centrist, although he has historic ties to the right. His platform emphasises job creation, improvement of educational standards, improved conditions in the troubled suburbs, reduced government spending, a balanced budget and a stronger European Union, with France as its &quot;de facto&quot; leader. He has also criticized China&#x27;s protection of the Sudanese government from UN Security Council sanctions. Bayrou was highly critical of the American economic model under George Bush and of the unregulated free market in general. He described the United States economic model as a &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; system, where it was often stated that money was people&#x27;s only motivation, where higher education was too expensive, and where the middle class was shrinking. Bayrou criticized the Iraq war, saying it was &quot;the cause of chaos&quot; in the region.
He criticized Nicolas Sarkozy&#x27;s foreign policy, including the invitation of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi for a week-long state visit to France and the signing of military cooperation agreements with Libya.

In 2009, he criticized statements by Pope Benedict XVI claiming that condoms promote AIDS on a journey to Cameroon. Bayrou called the remarks &quot;unacceptable&quot;, adding that &quot;the primary responsibility, particularly of Christians, is the defence of life...This [Africa] is a continent in which tens of millions of women and men are dying.&quot;

He called for France to boycott the 2008 Summer Olympics, due to the poor human rights record in China and political unrest in Tibet. During a rally in Paris on 21 March he said that &quot;if this drama does not stop, France would do itself credit by not coming to the Olympic Games&quot;, criticising China&#x27;s opposition to sanctions against Sudan over its involvement in the humanitarian crisis in Darfur.

Bayrou is fluent in Béarnese and often expresses his support for regionalism.

===Bétharram Scandal and François Bayrou’s Involvement===

The Bétharram scandal refers to a case of child sexual abuse committed within the Catholic congregation of the Fathers of Bétharram, as revealed by journalistic investigations. This Catholic congregation is in full communion with Rome and has followed all of the liberal reforms of the clergy. The abuses spanned several decades and involved clergy members operating in various schools and shelters linked to the institution. François Bayrou is accused of deliberately ignoring reports of child abuse, defending an institution accused of systemic violence, and helping to obstruct the work of whistleblowers and journalists.

François Bayrou, mayor of Pau and an influential political figure, was directly alerted to the abuses committed within the Bétharram congregation. He was informed through victim testimonies and whistleblower reports about the systemic violence perpetrated in religious establishments in his region.
Instead of supporting the victims or calling for a thorough investigation, François Bayrou publicly questioned the credibility of the allegations and defended the congregation. He notably claimed that the journalistic revelations were attacks against the Church, suggesting that they were part of a media driven witch hunt but he denied these facts. Bayrou downplayed the scope of the accusations, even publicly stating that the claims were baseless, despite consistent testimonies and thorough journalistic investigations. He challenged the legitimacy of whistleblowers and journalists who exposed these abuses. Rather than taking action in favor of the victims, French authorities, influenced by political figures including François Bayrou, targeted the whistleblowers who exposed these abuses. This repression took the form of legal pressure and judicial actions aimed at discrediting those who spoke out about the sexual violence.

<text>A haboob () is a type of intense dust storm carried by the wind of a weather front. Haboobs occur regularly in dry land area regions throughout the world.

== Formation and characteristics ==

During thunderstorm formation, winds move in a direction opposite to the storm&#x27;s travel, and they move from all directions into the thunderstorm. When the storm collapses and begins to release precipitation, wind directions reverse, gusting outward from the storm and generally gusting the strongest in the direction of the storm&#x27;s travel.

When this downdraft of cold air, or downburst, reaches the ground, it sweeps up dry, loose silt and clay (referred to collectively as dust) from the desert, forming a wall of airborne sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This dust wall can span up to 100 km (62 mi) in width and extend several kilometers in elevation. During their peak intensity, haboob winds can reach speeds of 35–100 km/h (22–62 mph) and may approach suddenly with minimal warning. Rain often fails to reach the ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air—a phenomenon known as virga). The evaporation process further chills the rushing air and propels it forward. In some instances, persistent rain may carry a significant amount of dust, leading to what is termed as &quot;mud storms&quot; in severe cases.

== Safety ==
Eye and respiratory system protection is advisable for anyone who must be outside during a haboob. Moving to shelter is highly advised during a strong event.

While operating a vehicle, drivers are advised to pull over to the side of the road and turn off their lights to avoid confusing other drivers in conditions of poor visibility.

== Occurrence ==
=== Middle East ===
Haboobs have been observed in the Sahara, Sahel (typically Sudan, where they were named and described), as well as across the Arabian Peninsula, throughout Kuwait, and in the most arid regions of Iraq. Haboob winds in the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, and Kuwait are frequently created by the collapse of a thunderstorm.

=== North Africa ===

African haboobs result from the northward summer shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone into North Africa, bringing moisture from the Gulf of Guinea.

=== Australia ===
Haboobs in Australia may be frequently associated with cold fronts. The deserts of Central Australia, especially near Alice Springs, are particularly prone to haboobs, with sand and debris reaching several kilometers into the sky and leaving up to of sand in the haboob&#x27;s path.

=== North America ===
As with haboobs in the Middle East, haboob occurrences in North America are often created by the collapse of a thunderstorm. This is a local or mesoscale event, and at times of extreme drought they can originate in agricultural regions. Some of the most famous dust storms of the Dust Bowl and similar conditions later were in fact synoptic scale events typically generated by a strong cold frontal passage, with storms on 11 November 1911, 9–11 May 1934, 14 April 1935, and 19 February 1954 having been particularly vivid examples.

The arid and semiarid regions of North America—in fact, any dry region—may experience haboobs. In North America, the most common terms for these events are either dust storm or sandstorm. In the U.S., they frequently occur in the deserts of Arizona, including around the cities of Yuma and Phoenix; in New Mexico, including Albuquerque; eastern California; and Texas. Per the Washington State Department of Ecology, they also occur in the Columbia Basin of Eastern Washington, and can impact cities such as Walla Walla and Spokane. In Washington, improved farming practices have led to a decline in large dust storms and haboobs since the 1990s, with the largest likelihood of formation between late March through April, corresponding to the beginning of field tilling in Eastern Washington. In Mexico, they occur in the northern part of the country in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Desert. Most recently, a haboob impacted the cities of Guaymas, San Carlos, and Empalme, Sonora on 20 July 2023.

=== Mars ===
Global dust storms on Mars have been compared to haboobs on Earth.

=== Titan ===
Dust storms of Titan observed in 2009 and 2010 have been compared to haboobs. However, the convective storm clouds are composed of liquid methane droplets, and the dust is likely composed of organic tholins.

<text>Passaggio () is a term used in classical singing to describe the transition area between the vocal registers. The &quot;passaggi&quot; (plural) of the voice lie between the different vocal registers, such as the chest voice, where any singer can produce a powerful sound, the middle voice, and the head voice, where a penetrating sound is accessible, but usually only through vocal training. The historic Italian school of singing describes a &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and a &quot;secondo passaggio&quot; connected through a &quot;zona di passaggio&quot; in the male voice and a &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and &quot;secondo passaggio&quot; in the female voice. A major goal of classical voice training in classical styles is to maintain an even timbre throughout the passaggio. Through proper training, it is possible to produce a resonant and powerful sound.

==Vocal registers==

Vocal registers may be described as &quot;perceptually distinct regions of vocal quality that can be maintained over some ranges of pitch and loudness.&quot; Discrepancies in terminology exist between different fields of vocal study, such as teachers and singers, researchers, and clinicians: for example, voice scientists may primarily see registration as &quot;acoustic events&quot;. For singers, it is more common to explain registration events based on the physical sensations they feel when singing. There are also discrepancies in the terminology used to talk about vocal registration between speech pathologists and singing teachers. Since this article discusses the &quot;passaggio&quot;, which is a term used by classical singers, the registers will be discussed as they are in the field of singing rather than speech pathology and science.

Most voices can be divided roughly into three main registers.
# Head 
# Middle or mixed
# Chest 
These three main registers are described as having a rich timbre, because of the overtones due to the sympathetic resonance within the human body. Their names are derived from the area in which the singer feels these resonant vibration in the body. The chest register, more commonly referred to as the chest voice, is the lowest of the registers. When singing in the chest voice the singer feels sympathetic vibration in the chest. This is the register that people most commonly use while speaking. The middle voice falls in-between the chest voice and head voice. The head register, or the head voice, is the highest of the main vocal registers. When singing in the head voice, the singer may feel sympathetic vibration occurring in the face or another part of the head. Where these registers lie in the voice is dependent on sex and the voice type within each sex.

There are an additional two registers called falsetto and flageolet register, which lie above their head register. Training is often required to access the pitches within these registers. Men and women with lower voices rarely sing in these registers. Lower voiced women in particular receive very little if any training in the flageolet register. Men have one more additional register called the &quot;strohbass&quot;, which lies below the chest voice. Singing in this register is hard on the vocal cords, and therefore, is hardly ever used.

The transitions between these registers are known as the &quot;passaggi&quot;.

==Register ranges==

===Male voices===

Here are the register ranges offered by Richard Miller for a lyric tenor:

*&quot;Strohbass&quot; – G2 to C3
*Chest – C3 to G3
*Middle (or mixed) – G3 to G4
**Lower Middle – G3 to D4
**Upper Middle – D4 to G4
*Head – G4 to C5
*Falsetto – C5 to G5

Miller describes the lower middle voice as being made up of a mixture of predominantly chest voice with a small amount of head voice. The upper middle he describes as a mixture of predominantly head voice with a small amount of chest voice. This concept holds true for all voice types both male and female. Men have 3 registers separated by 2 passaggi. Each register’s image and shape can be expressed with the shape of a V. (3 V’s, or a double hour glass are acceptable images). Men have 2 passaggi for open vowels and one passaggio for closed vowels. Tenor voices are the highest of the male voice types, with the exception of the countertenor voice, which makes much greater use of the falsetto register. Baritones are the next lowest voice after tenors, and they are followed by bass-baritones, and then basses. As a result of their lower voices, the ranges for these parts will be lower than that of the ranges listed for tenor above.

===Female voices===

The register ranges for a &quot;generic soprano voice&quot;, as given by Richard Miller in &quot;Training Soprano Voices&quot;, are as follows:

*Chest – G3 to E4
*Middle (or mixed) – E4 to F5
**Lower Middle – E4 to C5
**Upper Middle – C5 to F5
*Head – F5 to C6 or C6
*Flageolet – D6 or D6 to the &quot;highest negotiable pitches&quot;

The register ranges for a mezzo-soprano voice are as follows:

*Chest – E3 or F3 to E4 or F4
*Middle (or mixed) – C4 to E5 or F5
**Lower Middle – C4 to B4 or B4
**Upper Middle – B4 to E5 or F5
*Head – F5 or F5 to B5 or B5
*Flageolet – B5 or C6 and up

The register ranges for a contralto voice are as follows:

*Chest – D3 to G4 or A4
*Middle (or mixed) – F4 to D5
**Lower Middle – F4 to A4
**Upper Middle – B4 to D5
*Head – E5 to A5
*Flageolet – A5 and up

The difference between ranges for different female voice types are relatively small, but it is these small differences that often determine a singer&#x27;s voice type. There are some areas where the registers appear to overlap. The notes in these areas can be sung in either the chest voice or the middle voice, depending on the singer. This requires training and control. It is better to sing these notes with a mixture of chest voice and head voice. Bringing the chest voice up too far can be very damaging to the female voice. Where the main register changes occur are the notes of the &quot;passaggi&quot;.

=== Voice types and passaggi===

The transitions between the registers are known as the &quot;passaggi&quot; in classical singing. There are several other common names for the &quot;passaggio&quot;. &quot;Lift&quot; is a word used in some schools of voice training to describe the &quot;passaggio&quot;. One of the most common terms for the &quot;passaggio&quot; is the &quot;break.&quot; Marilee David in her book &quot;The New Voice Pedagogy&quot; explains, &quot;The area where the voice must change registers are often called breaks because the untrained voice appears to break into a new type of production. This break is a sudden gap in sound which occurs when the thyroarytenoid muscles suddenly decrease their activity and the cricothyroid muscles begin to function. A skillful transition of this muscular activity is one of the marks of the trained singer.&quot; David does a wonderful job describing the science behind &quot;passaggio&quot;; however, the term &quot;break&quot;, while used frequently during commercial styles of singing, such as pop, rock, country, etc., is usually avoided in classical training. As Miller states, &quot;Register terminology should be carefully chosen. &#x27;Breaks&#x27; and &#x27;lifts&#x27; may well refer to existing register phenomena in a voice, but psychologically, they tend to point up the division between registers rather than their unification.&quot;

Lucero et al. have proposed another theory for the production of voice breaks in terms of the acoustic interaction between the vocal fold oscillation and the vocal tract resonances (formant). The interaction may cause frequency and amplitude jumps when the fundamental frequency of the oscillation or a harmonics crosses through a formant. The occurrence of such jumps depends on the cross-sectional area of the epilarynx, which couples the larynx to the downstream vocal tract, and is facilitated by a narrower area. 

Voice Specialist Ingo Titze explains, &quot;Register changes may occur voluntarily or involuntarily.&quot; For all singers, mainly classical, negotiating the &quot;passaggi&quot; can be difficult and can take years to learn how to accomplish well. Classical voice training aims to provide the singer with the tools necessary to move through the &quot;passaggi&quot; so that the transition between registers sounds seamless and will be unrecognizable to the audience. In his many books on developing the different male and female voice types, Richard Miller gives many exercises for developing the registers and the transitions between them.

==== Male voices ====

In Richard Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique&quot;, Miller identifies the male vocal &quot;passaggi&quot; as follows:
# The &quot;primo passaggio&quot;
# The &quot;secondo passaggio&quot;
# The &quot;zona di passaggio&quot;

The &quot;primo passaggio&quot; is the first register transition. In the male voice, Miller indicates that this &quot;passaggio&quot; occurs between the lower middle register, which is a mixture of predominantly chest voice and some head voice, and the upper middle register, which is a mixture of predominantly head voice and some chest voice. It is important to note that the &quot;primo passaggio&quot; is not agreed upon by all voice specialists. As James Stark notes in &quot;Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy&quot;, &quot;Richard Miller, who visited numerous Italian voice studios, describes male voices as having a &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and a &quot;secondo passaggio&quot;, with a &quot;zona di passaggio&quot; between them. However, he cites not published literature regarding this theory, and most written sources discuss only one &quot;passaggio&quot; in male voices... and two &quot;passaggi&quot; in females (one between chest and middle, and one between middle and head registers).&quot; While the number of &quot;passaggi&quot; in men appears up for debate, most everyone seems to agree on the existence of at least one &quot;passaggio&quot;. The most often discussed &quot;passaggio&quot; in published works is what Miller calls the &quot;secondo passaggio&quot;, which lies between the upper middle voice and the head voice. Because of the discrepancy surrounding the &quot;primo passaggio&quot;, Miller&#x27;s &quot;zona di passaggio&quot; is also up for debate. Miller describes the &quot;zona di passaggio&quot; as the area between the &quot;primo passaggio&quot; and the &quot;secondo passaggio&quot;, which he says is an area that needs to be negotiated carefully.

Here are the &quot;passaggi&quot; for tenor voices, as proposed by Miller:
*&quot;Tenorino&quot;: 
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – E4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – A4
*&quot;Tenore leggiero&quot; (&quot;tenore di grazia&quot;):
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – E4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – A4
*&quot;Spieltenor&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – E4 or D4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – A4 or G4
*&quot;Tenore lirico&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – D4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – G4
*&quot;Tenore lirico spinto&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – C4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – F4
*&quot;Tenore robusto&quot;, &quot;tenore drammatico&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – C4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – F4
*&quot;Heldentenor&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – C4 or B3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – F4 or E4

Here are the &quot;passaggi&quot; for baritone, bass-baritone, and bass voices, as proposed by Miller:
*Lyric baritone:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – B3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – E4
*Dramatic (Verdi) baritone:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – B3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – E4
*Bass-baritone:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – A3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – D4
*Lyric bass:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – A3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – D4
*&quot;Basso profondo&quot;:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – G3
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – C4

==== Female voices ====

In the same book, &quot;The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique&quot;, Miller identifies the female vocal &quot;passaggi&quot; as follows:
# The &quot;primo passaggio&quot;
# The &quot;secondo passaggio&quot;

Unlike the male &quot;passaggi&quot;, the two female &quot;passaggi&quot; are widely agreed upon. In his book &quot;The Structure of Singing: System and Art in Vocal Technique&quot;, Miller also posits, &quot;Many sopranos experience an additional pivotal point midway in the long middle register around C-sharp5 with lower-middle register lying below that pitch, and upper-middle register lying above it.&quot;

Here are the &quot;passaggi&quot; for female voices, as proposed by Miller:
*Soprano:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – E4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – F5
*Mezzo-soprano:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – E4 or F4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – E5 or F5
*Contralto:
**&quot;Primo passaggio&quot; – G4 or A4
**&quot;Secondo passaggio&quot; – D5

<doc id="625914" wikidata="Q7782332" url="?curid=625914" title="Theophostic Prayer Ministry">
<text>Transformational Prayer Ministry (formerly Theophostic counseling) was developed in the United States during the mid-1990s by Ed Smith, a Baptist minister.

Its name comes from the Greek () and quasi-Greek &quot;phostic&quot; (), and it is often associated with the Christian Inner Healing Movement. Smith says people are being delivered from phobias, depression, anxiety disorders, obsessive–compulsive disorder, dissociative personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sexual addiction, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and homosexuality through Theophostic principles. The name &quot;Theophostic&quot; is a registered trademark.

Few empirical evaluations of Theophostic ministry are available, although Christian psychologist Fernando Garzon says that current case study and survey data has yielded clinically significant changes in client symptom levels, and high degrees of client and practitioner satisfaction.

== Definition ==
Smith&#x27;s definition of Theophostic Prayer Ministry is that &quot;Theophostic is a ministry of helping emotionally wounded people to acknowledge and to identify the true source of their inner emotional pain and find lasting peace through receiving personalized truth directly from the Lord.&quot;

== Process ==
Participants in a typical Theophostic Prayer Ministry session are the ministry recipient, a ministry facilitator and optionally a prayer partner.

The ministry facilitator ensures that the ministry recipient understands the process before the session begins.

The facilitator begins the session with a prayer of encouragement.

The ministry recipient closes their eyes and concentrates on feeling the emotional pain from which they are seeking relief. The purpose of focusing on the emotion is to allow their mind to drift back to a related memory. That memory is of a situation that the recipient regards as painful and which they have interpreted to form a belief about themself or their situation. The event that is contained in the memory may have occurred many years ago, for example in the person&#x27;s childhood. The emotion provides a bridge to the belief.

The ministry recipient describes the memory to the facilitator. The facilitator asks the recipient some questions that will enable the recipient to drill down to the core belief housed in this memory that is troubling them. The questions are not leading questions, as the facilitator does not assume anything about the memory&#x27;s content. Rather they are open questions, posed to help the recipient himself to identify the core belief. This core belief is known in TPM parlance as a &quot;lie&quot; that causes lie-based pain. The lie arises from the recipient&#x27;s interpretation of the situation. For example, a rape victim may have formed a belief that they are dirty or shameful, whereas they were actually an innocent victim. Though their belief is false, it has the same impact on their emotional state now as if it were true.

Once the recipient has identified the core troublesome belief, the facilitator prays, asking Jesus to provide the recipient with his perspective, that is, what he would like the recipient to know. According to TPM, Jesus answers that prayer in various ways. Jesus might provide his truth to the recipient by means of a mental picture, a feeling, a scripture, a word, a realization, or some other way. The truth received from Jesus replaces the painful lie previously believed, and the result is peace.

TPM says that every person believes not just one but many lies of the kind that lead to present emotional pain. Each lie can be eliminated with the same process.

== Research ==
In his 2008 book, Fernando Garzon, an associate professor in the Center for Counselling and Family Studies at Liberty University, describes his team&#x27;s two-year-long outcomes-based case study research project that evaluated TPM. The research team found very clear preliminary results that showed a correlation between TPM treatment and symptom reductions. Garzon wrote that the case studies strongly support the need for randomized comparative or control group studies.

Garzon had conducted preliminary practitioner studies in 2001 which showed promise, concluding that &quot;...outcome-based case studies and randomized clinical trials should proceed on TPM to ascertain whether the therapeutic perception of efficacy displayed in this survey actually has merit...&quot; He also found that a wide variety of people were practicing Theophostic ministry at that time, including pastors, lay counselors, and psychologists. According to Garzon, this raised questions about some practitioners&#x27; level of training.

A Kentucky journalist has associated Theophostic Prayer Ministry with recovered-memory therapy (RMT), an approach now widely discredited after discovery of false memory phenomena on the basis that Theophostic Prayer Ministry also presupposes the possibility of repression or memory inhibition, A critical entry from Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance also associates Theophostic ministry with recovered-memory therapy, although the article does not identify the aspects of Theophostic Prayer Ministry that merit the assertion. It also claims that Theophostic Prayer Ministry has added beliefs about demonic possession, Satanic influence, direct communication with &quot;Jesus Christ or the Holy Spirit&quot; and &quot;unique concepts about the inner workings of the mind&quot;. However, Smith himself strongly repudiates Recovered Memory Therapy, and in recent years he has taught that it is counter-productive to pursue or even allow demonic confrontations in a ministry session. However, in his Basic Training Seminar Manual and in each of the training videos, Smith warns strongly against making any suggestions that might affect the actual content of a memory, and he lists ten ways in which TPM differs from RMT. Nevertheless, once a core belief about self has been identified through the memory (not in the memory per se), Smith does &quot;invite the Lord&quot; to speak truth to the ministry recipient concerning that belief.

In an article about TPM in the &quot;Christian Research Journal&quot;, Elliot Miller said that to accuse TPM of practicing recovered memory therapy and visualization is to betray ignorance or bias against TPM that refuses to be corrected by clear and consistent facts.

A Christian psychologist, David Entwistle, has expressed concerns with its practice: &quot;TPM follows in the lineage of &#x27;healing of memory&#x27; techniques, though it departs from that lineage in a number of important respects. Numerous concerns exist surrounding insufficient attempts to ground TPM in biblical concepts; inadequate and often flawed explanations of basic psychological processes; dubious claims about the prevalence of [dissociative identity disorder, Satanic ritual abuse], and demonic activity; estimates of traumatic abuse that exceed empirical findings; and the failure to sufficiently appreciate the possibility of iatrogenic memory contamination&quot;.

Entwistle raises concern over empirical validity, with questions about literal appearances of God, as Entwistle interprets claimed perceptions of truth, including spontaneous visualizations of Christ; ethical and legal issues relating to guarantees of healing; application of TPM to a variety of mental disorders without empirical validation; the legal question of whether it should be considered a religious intervention or a counseling procedure – and whether this was settled by changing the name from Theophostic counseling to Theophostic ministry; and the failure of Smith to welcome public analysis and critique of TPM.

In Cumberland, Maine, sexual-abuse charges against ex-member Tom Wright were brought after a church member&#x27;s memory surfaced during Theophostic sessions of Wright allegedly abusing a child. When the case went to trial in 2002, the charges were thrown out by the district attorney because evidence was based on &#x27;unconventional and biased therapeutic methods&#x27;. The district attorney noted that these methods were considered unreliable by the American Psychological Society. In 2006, in Australia, a psychologist was found guilty of malpractice by the Queensland Health Practitioners Tribunal for using Theophostic methods. The tribunal found that Irene Moreau, who practiced from a Christian counselling centre in Brisbane, &#x27;inappropriately used Theophostic Prayer Ministry as a counselling technique&#x27;.

Practitioners of techniques such as TPM frequently do not have formal training in psychology or counseling, although Fernando Garzon suggests that this in many cases may be beneficial, saying: &quot;...it may serve people who might not get help otherwise, cannot afford professional therapy, do not wish to use insurance, or have access to counseling limited by managed care. Others belong to churches in which the pastor is either not trained, not interested, or not available (due to having too many other pastoral duties) to meet the needs for pastoral counseling. Still others simply may trust lay people, whom they know, more than a therapist, whom they do not know. In addition, the training itself may benefit the lay counselors spiritually and emotionally.&quot;

In addition to questions about the efficacy, safety and reliability of TPM, it has also divided Christian observers with regard to the soundness of its theology. In the conclusion of their paper &quot;A theological analysis of Theophostic Ministry&quot;, Bryan Maier and Philip Monroe put it this way: &quot;...on the issues of sin and healing, the question remains for Christian counselors and the evangelical community as a whole as to whether Smith&#x27;s &#x27;theological basis&#x27; is consistent with responsible biblical doctrine. We do not think that Smith has warrant to make this claim. Furthermore, we think these differences are so significant that we advise great caution before engaging in this ministry – whether as a client or as facilitator.&quot;

<doc id="625919" wikidata="Q6426036" url="?curid=625919" title="Kohler Co.">
<text>Kohler Co., is an American manufacturing company founded in 1873 by John Michael Kohler, based in Kohler, Wisconsin. Kohler is best known for its plumbing products, but the company also manufactures furniture, cabinetry, tile, engines, and generators. Destination Kohler also owns various hospitality establishments in the United States and Scotland. In February 2017, Kohler Co. acquired UK-based Clarke Energy from the management team and ECI Partners, a multinational specialist in the engineering, construction, installation, and maintenance of engine-based power plants and is an authorized distributor of GE&#x27;s reciprocating engines in 19 countries worldwide. In November 2023, it was announcing that Kohler is establishing the Energy group independently and would be bought in a complex partnership with private equity group Platinum Equity, the deal is slated to close in Q1 2024.

==History==

Kohler Co. was co-founded in 1873 by Austrian immigrant John Michael Kohler and Charles Silberzahn with the purchase of the Sheboygan Union Iron and Steel Foundry from Kohler&#x27;s father-in-law, Jacob Vollrath, for $5000. Early products included cast iron and steel farm implements, castings for furniture factories, and ornamental iron pieces including cemetery crosses and settees. A breakthrough came in 1883 when John Michael applied enamel to a cast-iron horse trough to create the company&#x27;s first bathtub. The company has been primarily in the plumbing business ever since and is known for its plumbing fixtures and faucets.

In the early 20th century, Kohler made drinking fountains with a &quot;bubbling valve&quot;, from which water shot vertically. Eventually, the entire fountain came to be known as a &quot;bubbler&quot; in the area in which Kohler products were sold. The term &quot;bubbler&quot; is still used in a few areas of Wisconsin and some other areas of the United States.

In 1934 and 1954, Kohler Strikes took place. A third strike took place in 1983 and lasted only a few weeks. On November 15, 2015, workers voted for the 2015 Kohler Strike, making it the fourth strike in the company&#x27;s history.

In 1984 Kohler acquired Sterling Faucet Company. The company was renamed as Sterling Plumbing Group Inc. The Sterling brand was integrated into the Kohler family of products. Kohler later expanded the offering of Sterling products adding to the faucet line, shower doors, sinks, toilets, and other bathroom accessories.

In 2007, Kohler created a joint venture in China called Kohler-YinXiang Ltd., based in Chongqing, China, to manufacture small gasoline engines, and intends to begin importing more of their engines, rather than building them in the US. Kohler&#x27;s UK subsidiary is the Cheltenham-based Kohler Mira Ltd, best known for manufacturing Mira Showers.

===Corporate management history===

Former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler Sr. was president of Kohler Co. and his son former Wisconsin Governor Walter J. Kohler Jr. served for many years in senior management. The presidency of Kohler was passed down from Herbert Kohler Jr. (born February 20, 1939, grandson of the founder), to his son, David Kohler, on June 1, 2015.

In 1998, Kohler made a plan to buy back any outstanding shares not owned by the family. All family members had to exchange their common shares for shares with limited rights that could not be sold. Since Kohler is &quot;not&quot; a publicly traded company, the number of shares floating was minimal. Kohler offered $55,400 per share, but some shareholders challenged this valuation and sued. The IRS also challenged this valuation by prosecuting the estate of Frederick Kohler, who had recently died holding 975 shares, but Kohler won the lawsuit.

=== Hiring practices ===

In 1999, a court case was brought by the United States Department of Labor alleging that Kohler Co.&#x27;s hiring practices were discriminatory to women. The company had an informal height requirement of for women, which is the average adult female height in the United States. Because of its contracts with the federal government, the company was prohibited from enforcing this requirement and as part of a settlement agreed to hire 111 of the 2,000 women who had applied to work at Kohler from 1994 to 1995 and to undertake a study &quot;to eliminate unnecessary barriers to women&quot;.

=== Working conditions ===

In 2005, China Labor Watch accused Kohler China (Investment) Co., Ltd. of major worker rights violations at its Foshan factory. These included: excessive work hours, lack of overtime pay, low wage payment, unsafe working conditions, uncompensated work injuries, and denying workers the ability to form their own union.

=== Controversy ===

In January 2020, Kohler paid $20 million in a settlement with the United States Department of Justice, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the state of California over its small engines&#x27; violations of the Clean Air Act and California law.

==Products==



Kohler&#x27;s bath and kitchen fixtures are available in American hardware and home improvement stores and from Kohler Kitchen and Bath distributors. Kohler still makes traditional cast iron bathtubs, one of the few United States manufacturers to do so. Besides residential products, Kohler manufactures a commercial line of bathroom fixtures. The company also does artistic custom work, such as hand-painted sinks and toilets. In 2015 Kohler was named by &quot;Builder&quot; magazine as the &quot;most used&quot; and &quot;best quality&quot; in the &quot;Bath Accessories&quot; category as well as the top spot for &quot;brand familiarity&quot;, &quot;most used&quot; and &quot;quality rating&quot; in the &quot;Bath Fixtures&quot; and &quot;Whirlpool Baths&quot; categories.

The Kohler Walk-In Bath Division designs, engineers, and builds accessible bathtubs that are easier to enter than traditional bathtub models. The division specializes in bathing products for people with limited mobility or who are disabled. Founded in 2015, this specialty division sells its bathtubs through independent dealers across the United States.

Kohler also makes a wide range of small industrial engines. Traditionally, the company manufactured gasoline engines; however, after purchasing the Italian company Lombardini, it extended its range and now offers diesel engines up to 134 HP. Kohler engines power a range of devices from water pumps to off-road vehicles. The &quot;Global Power&quot; group manufactures generators of varying sizes. Kohler was the first company to offer residential backup generators, starting in 1920.

Since 2007, the company has been expanding in the areas of furniture, cabinetry, and tile in the consumer market, and engines and generators for industry. The Kohler Interiors division of the company comprises Robern, Sprig, Kallista, Ann Sacks Tile and Kast.

Kohler displays many of its products at the Kohler Design Center in the village of Kohler.

At CES 2018 Kohler unveiled a new product line called Kohler Konnect, consisting of smart connected plumbing fixtures including bathtubs, mirrors, shower heads, toilets, and shower valves. These new digital fixtures have WiFi capabilities, enabling voice assistant control through Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa or Apple HomeKit, and app control support via the Kohler Konnect app. The Kohler Konnect services are powered by the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform. Competitors include the U by Moen shower controller and kitchen faucet, and the Delta VoiceIQ kitchen faucet.

==Sponsorships==

In 2018, Kohler became a sponsor of English football giant Manchester United. As the club’s first sleeve sponsor from 2018–22, Kohler had its logo prominently displayed on all United jerseys. While the company was replaced by fellow American company DXC Technology as sleeve sponsor in 2022, it remains an official United partner.

In early 2021, Kohler announced they would be sponsoring Roush Fenway Racing driver Ryan Newman for a selected number of races in 2021, debuting in the 2021 Daytona 500, while using Kohler Generators as their sponsor. They continued their sponsorship in 2022 with driver Brad Keselowski, who left Team Penske at the end of 2021 to join Roush as a driver/minority co-owner under the team rebranded Roush Fenway Keselowski Racing, or RFK Racing in 2022.

==Destination Kohler==
 
Kohler Co.&#x27;s hospitality and real estate group, Destination Kohler, oversees the management, marketing and tourism promotion for its golf courses, hotels, private clubs, shops, restaurants, company-sponsored and village events. The American Club is a highly rated resort hotel in the Midwest.

==John Michael Kohler Arts Center==

Kohler Co. is affiliated with the non-profit John Michael Kohler Arts Center in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, which occupies a square block of downtown Sheboygan that contains Kohler&#x27;s restored former mansion, several newer buildings, and the exterior structure of the former Carnegie-era Mead Public Library building as a modern &quot;ruin&quot;. The John Michael Kohler Arts Center operates an Arts/Industry program, the primary component of which is a residency program at Kohler. Artists have the opportunity to spend two to six months creating works of art using the industrial materials and equipment.

==Residential review committee==

The company continues to maintain a residential review committee (similar to a homeowner association) which ensures the compliance of the original Kohler Village plans and architectural designs from the defunct Kohler Improvement Company. Residents who want to add onto their home, build new outbuildings or fences must receive Kohler Company RRC approval before taking their plans to the planning commission, and comply with the design and aesthetic standards of the Kohler Company RRC.

<doc id="625926" wikidata="Q7044061" url="?curid=625926" title="No Conscription League">
<text>The No Conscription League was an anarchist organisation designed to promote anti-draft manifestos and aid those who refused military service. The league lasted for six weeks and was used to charge its founders Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman with conspiracy to obstruct the draft.

==Formation==
The No Conscription League in the United States was founded by anarchist Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman in 1917 in response to the draft in World War I. The draft was enforced by the Selective Service Act of 1917, which granted the federal government the right to raise a national army. The league viewed the draft as a destroyer of the freedom to ethical and political choice granted by the constitution of the United States. The members of the league strongly opposed government-enforced conscription; they saw it as a violation of the liberty of American people. This oppression was justified by Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Espionage Act of 1917, which prohibited any action that would interfere with the US military or government affairs. Many were prosecuted under this act, including those in the No Conscription League. Those charged were fined a maximum of 10,000 dollars and were sentenced to up to 20 years of imprisonment.

==Manifesto==
Emma Goldman and the members of her league published a piece of literature known as the No Conscription League manifesto. This document goes into great detail about the freedoms of Americans, and how the government was oppressing citizens&#x27; certain unalienable rights. Goldman urges the nation for support and promotes the need to protect and fight for one&#x27;s liberty as a citizen. This pamphlet went into circulation with over 100,000 printed, which caused fear in the eyes of the US government. The following is the platform on which the league was founded, taken from the manifesto itself:

==Gatherings==
Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman held a mass No Conscription League meeting on 4 June 1917. In addition to Goldman and Berkman, speakers included Louis Baury, &quot;Mother&quot; Yusher, Stella Comyn Ballantine, Leonard D. Abbott, Katia Siebel, and Rose Yuster. After the meeting, police asked to see the selective service enrollment cards of many participants; many did not have these cards and were detained and taken to jail. There was much fear, due to governmental restrictions such as the Espionage Act.

==Government response==
Due to the mass number of publications of the manifesto, the government retaliated against people who were in opposition to the draft. Anti-draft meetings were forbidden, and those speaking out against the draft were to be arrested. In response to the 4 June 1917 mass meeting, Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman were arrested with bail set at $25,000 each. According to the PBS time line on Emma Goldman regarding her arrest, &quot;Berkman and Goldman were found guilty of conspiracy against the selective draft law in New York City. They were fined $10,000, sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment, and immediately transported to federal penitentiaries: Berkman was sent to Atlanta State Penitentiary in Georgia and Goldman was taken to Jefferson City Penitentiary in Missouri&quot;.

<doc id="625929" wikidata="Q5026394" url="?curid=625929" title="Cameron Thompson (politician)">
<text>Cameron Paul Thompson (born 1 October 1960) served as a member of the Australian House of Representatives representing the Division of Blair in Queensland. A member of the Liberal Party, he served from 1998 until 2007.

==Early life==

Thompson was born in Rockhampton, Queensland, and was a radio journalist, as well as press secretary and chief of staff to several state and territory politicians in Queensland and the Northern Territory before entering politics.

==Election to parliament==
Thompson was preselected for the new division of Blair for the 1998 election. Considerable press at the time focussed on the contest, as the redistribution creating the seat had split One Nation leader Pauline Hanson&#x27;s seat of Oxley in half. A Labor-friendly section around Brisbane remained in Oxley, while a more rural section became Blair. Hanson opted to contest Blair, which contained most of her former base.

After election day, the contest was noted for being one of only ten occasions where a candidate who did not finish first or second went on to win under Australia&#x27;s instant-runoff voting system. Thompson finished third on the first count, behind Hanson and Labor&#x27;s Virginia Clarke. However, the major parties all preferenced each other ahead of Hanson, allowing Thompson to pull ahead of Clarke on National preferences. On the eighth count, Thompson picked up three-fourths of Clarke&#x27;s preferences, enough for him to win the two party preferred vote against Hanson.

Thompson&#x27;s ousting of Hanson from Federal Parliament was to be his only claim to political fame.

==The Goodna Bypass==
Thompson led a proposal to construct a bypass east of the city of Ipswich, known as the Goodna Bypass and connecting Dinmore to the Logan Motorway, in preference to a six-lane upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway.

In pursuit of the bypass, he encountered opposition from leaders within his own party including Queensland&#x27;s state Liberal leader Dr Bruce Flegg and Brisbane Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. After a set of feasibility studies and options reports, the federal government announced funding for the A$2.3 billion Goodna Bypass. By July, the cost had increased to $2.8 billion.

As the 2007 election approached, Thompson campaigned almost solely on the Goodna Bypass, which Labor had said they would not build if they won government. However, a redistribution pushed Blair further into Ipswich. The new territory was significantly pro-Labor and cut Thompson&#x27;s majority in half, from a relatively safe 11.2 percent to a marginal 5.7 percent—putting it just outside the range of seats Labor would need to take off the Coalition in order to win government. Together with a strong swing in Queensland towards the Labor Party, this resulted in Thompson&#x27;s defeat by Labor candidate Shayne Neumann, with a two party preferred swing of 10.17%—significantly over the Queensland average swing of 7.53%.

==Post-parliamentary life==
Thompson became a senior adviser to state National leader Lawrence Springborg and temporarily vacated that position to contest the state Liberal presidency against his federal parliamentary colleague Mal Brough and sitting Liberal Party president Gary Spence on a platform of merging the Liberal and National parties. In 2010, he was unsuccessful in getting the endorsement of the newly merged Liberal National Party of Queensland to be the party&#x27;s candidate for the Division of Wright.

<doc id="625933" wikidata="Q17130172" url="?curid=625933" title="Tuck Everlasting (1981 film)">
<text>Tuck Everlasting is an American television film based on Natalie Babbitt&#x27;s 1975 book of the same title. The film premiered in 1980 on Channel 4 in New York.

==Background==
After Frederick King Keller made the TV movie &quot;Skeleton Key&quot;, he met Natalie Babbitt at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. He liked her novel &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot; and decided to produce and direct a film based on it.

The film was produced with a budget of $150,000 in Buffalo, New York, in association with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo. Production ran from 1977 to 1980 and was stalled three times due to budget issues.

==Plot==

The story involves the Tucks, a family who drank from a magic spring from the Fosters&#x27; little forest and became immortal (hence the name &quot;Tuck Everlasting&quot;).

==Cast==
*Margaret Chamberlain – Winnie Foster
*Paul Flessa – Jesse Tuck
*Fred A. Keller – Angus Tuck
*James McGuire – Man in the Yellow Suit
*Sonia Raimi – Mae Tuck
*Marvin Macnow – Mr. Foster
*Bruce D&#x27;Auria – Miles Tuck
*Patricia Roth – Script Supervior
*Joel Chaney - Boy #2

==Filming==
Much of the film was shot in Western New York, including the opening scene which was shot at the Grape Festival in Silver Creek.
Filming also took place in Adirondack for one year. Filming was completed at the start of 1980.

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;″ Robert Alan Ross and &quot;Tampa Times&quot;″ Steve Otto; the latter called the film &quot;a finely crafted, intelligent and completely enjoyable picture.&quot; &quot;Buffalo Evening News&quot;″ Mary Ann Lauricella thought the cinematography was &quot;a treat for the eye&quot; that made up for the film&#x27;s occasional slow pacing.

<text>Alan Fletcher (born 30 March 1957) is an Australian actor of stage, television and film. He is also a singer and musician. He is perhaps best known for his television soap opera role in &quot;Neighbours&quot; as Dr. Karl Kennedy. He has also played Frank Rossi in &quot;Cop Shop&quot; and Michael Clayton in &quot;Embassy&quot;. In 2007, he was a contestant on the UK reality show &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;.

Having appeared in &quot;Neighbours&quot; since 1994, Fletcher is the third longest serving actor in an Australian television serial, after &quot;Home and Away&quot; actors Ray Meagher and Lynne McGranger.

==Career==
Fletcher was born in Perth, Western Australia, and attended Wesley College in Perth. Fletcher appeared in various stage productions in Perth, including &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, &quot;Privates on Parade&quot; and &quot;Something&#x27;s Afoot&quot;. He was also asked to appear in the play &quot;Beyond a Joke&quot; alongside British actor Arthur Lowe. Fletcher met his then-fiancée actress Merrin Canning during a production of &quot;The Ghost Train&quot;. After continuing to work on the stage together in Perth, they moved to Sydney. Fletcher guested in &quot;The Young Doctors&quot;, before appearing in the second Australian episode of the US drama &quot;The Love Boat&quot; in 1981 as the on-screen fiancé of Morgan Fairchild. His first major television role was Constable Frank Rossi in the Seven Network police drama &quot;Cop Shop&quot;, which he began filming in May 1982.

Fletcher starred in the Australian feature film &quot;Fran&quot; alongside Noni Hazlehurst in 1985. He also appeared in &quot;Mercy Mission&quot;. He appeared in &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1987 as Greg Cooper, a mechanic working in Jim Robinson&#x27;s (Alan Dale) garage. In 1994, Fletcher successfully auditioned for the role of Karl Kennedy in the soap, a role which he continues to play. His on-screen wife Susan Kennedy is played by Jackie Woodburne, who previously played his sister in &quot;Cop Shop&quot;.

In 2005, Fletcher starred as Henry Higgins in a production of &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the Melbourne Comedy Theatre. He is also a prominent member of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, a role which saw him become a vocal critic of the 2004 US-Australia Free Trade Agreement, including an appearance on the political talk-show Meet the Press.

In 2008, Fletcher starred as Frank McGee in the workshop performance season of &quot;Call Girl the Musical&quot; and as Captain Hook in the Pantomime &quot;Peter Pan&quot; at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, Aberdeen.

In 2011, Fletcher spent time in Old Melbourne Gaol to raise money for the charity &quot;Whitelion&quot;. In order to break out, Fletcher and fellow &quot;Neighbours&quot; cast members Stefan Dennis, Jordy Lucas and Valentina Novakovic had to each raise $1,000.

In May 2013, along with Saskia Hampele, he presented the award of Best Newcomer to Joseph Thompson at the British Soap Awards. Fletcher appeared in a documentary special celebrating &quot;Neighbours&quot;″ 30th anniversary titled &quot;Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite&quot;, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015.
===Musical career===
Fletcher is also the lead singer in a band called Waiting Room, alongside Tommy Rando, Chris Hawker and Jeff Consi. The group has toured the United Kingdom several times. With a handful of their own songs they incorporate a selection of cover versions into their set, including Smokie&#x27;s &quot;Living Next Door to Alice&quot;, replacing &#x27;Alice&#x27; with &#x27;Susan&#x27;, a reference to his &quot;Neighbours&quot; on-screen wife. Their single, &quot;So Wrong&quot;, was released on iTunes on 26 November 2007, followed by their album, &quot;Live at the Elephant&quot;, on 17 December 2007.

On 30 November 2007, Fletcher performed a cover of the Oasis song &quot;Wonderwall&quot; for BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Live Lounge.

In December 2008, Fletcher played a solo gig in Aberdeen, performing a mixture of covers and Waiting Room material. He followed this with a second gig in the city on 3 January 2009 at The Lemon Tree.

On 15 May 2009, Fletcher announced via his official website that he was to tour the UK with a new band, The X-Rays due to the economic situation of bringing Waiting Room with him. The tour took place in September and October 2009 and featured some original Waiting Room material. The X-Rays are UK-based musicians Johnny Lucas, Chris Hanby and Martin Stewart. Fletcher continued to perform each week in Melbourne with Waiting Room.

In September 2010, Fletcher announced on his official website that he would be touring the UK with Tommy Rando in November and December of that year. On 28 November 2010, during his UK tour, Fletcher appeared on &quot;The Xtra Factor&quot; to discuss the potential winners of the show.

In September 2012, Fletcher played a charity gig at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush branch of the pub chain Walkabout in aid of Blue September, a charity raising funds for cancer research.

Fletcher was a contestant on the UK TV show &quot;Soapstar Superstar&quot;, in January 2007 finishing in sixth place. He performed the following songs:
* Day 1: &quot;Faith&quot; (George Michael)
* Day 2: &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; (Simon &amp; Garfunkel)
* Day 3: &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; (Eric Clapton)
* Day 4: &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; (Andy Williams)
* Day 5: &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Go Down on Me&quot; (Elton John)

In 2013, Fletcher released a Christmas single, &quot;If You Want A Happy Christmas&quot;, on which he collaborated with The Pacific Belles.

===Photography and travel===
In 2018, Fletcher combined his interests in travel and photography in a reality television program &quot;Photo Number 6&quot;. Fletcher explores the world with actor and director, Stig Wemyss, as they seek travel experiences that go beyond the tourist guidebook and delve into the heart and soul of the places. They look for photographic images that encapsulate emotion, geography and human connections.

==Personal life==
Fletcher is married to Jennifer Hansen, a former newsreader for the Ten Network and they have two children.

Fletcher supports Essendon Football Club and Liverpool Football Club.

Fletcher is an ambassador for &quot;Blue September&quot;, a charity that raises awareness of all cancers that can affect men. In 2011, Fletcher helped launch the charity in Britain.

In 2022, following media reports about his health due to his sudden hair loss, Fletcher revealed that he had been diagnosed with alopecia areata. This condition was worked into the plot of &quot;Neighbours&quot;, where it was said that dodgy hair products caused Karl&#x27;s hair to fall out.

Fletcher&#x27;s grandfather was a well respected organ builder in Liverpool with Rushworth&#x27;s (Australian Organist Review Dec 1995).

<doc id="625938" wikidata="Q1278537" url="?curid=625938" title="Ebbets Field">
<text>Ebbets Field was a Major League Baseball stadium in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, New York. It is mainly known for having been the home of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team of the National League (1913–1957). It was also home to Negro league baseball&#x27;s Brooklyn Eagles of the Negro National League II and to six gridiron football teams, five of which were professional and one of which was collegiate. The professional football teams consisted of three NFL teams (1921–1948), one AFL team (1936), and one AAFC team (1946–1948); Long Island University&#x27;s football team (whose nickname was the &quot;blackbirds&quot; at the time) used Ebbets Field in 1939 and 1940. The stadium was demolished in 1960 and replaced by the Ebbets Field Apartments, the site&#x27;s current occupant. It was located east of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Washington Ave, north of Empire Boulevard, west of Bedford Ave.

==History==

===Construction===

After locating the prospective new site to build a permanent stadium to replace the old wooden Washington Park, Dodgers&#x27; owner Charles Ebbets acquired the property over several years, starting in 1908, by buying lots until he owned the entire block. Ebbets Field was bounded by Bedford Avenue to the east, Sullivan Place to the South, Cedar Street (renamed McKeever Place in 1932) to the west, and Montgomery Street to the north. 

The land included the site of a garbage dump called Pigtown, so named because of the pigs that once ate their fill there and the stench that filled the air. At the groundbreaking, the site was described as containing several old houses, shanties, goats, and tomato cans, and although the streets bordering the field were mapped, two of them had not been built yet.

Construction began on March 4, 1912. The cornerstone, a piece of Connecticut granite that held newspapers, pictures of baseball players, cards, telegrams, and almanacs, was laid on July 6, 1912. At the laying ceremony, Ebbets said that the ballpark was going to be ready for play on September 1, and that Brooklyn was going to win the National League pennant in 1913.

Neither of Ebbets&#x27; predictions was correct: on August 29, 1912, as the deadline drew near and it was obvious that due to an ironworker&#x27;s strike the ballpark was not even close to being finished, it was announced that Ebbets had sold a 50% interest in the team to brothers Stephen W. and Edward J. McKeever, who had built their fortune in contracting and were able to speed along the construction. Though the sale led to management troubles years later, by early 1913 Ebbets Field was ready, and would become the home of some of baseball&#x27;s greatest dramas.

Newspaper coverage in the spring of 1913 was filled with glowing praise about the new park, calling it &quot;A Monument to the National Game&quot; and predicting it could last 200 years: in the end it only lasted 47 years, failing to survive the exit of the Dodgers for Los Angeles in 1957.

===Opening===
The first game played was an inter-league exhibition game against the New York Yankees on April 5, 1913, played before an overcapacity of 30,000 fans, with 5,000 more who had arrived but were not able to get in. After a loss against the Yankees in another exhibition game on April 7 in front of about 1,000 fans on a very cold day, the first regular season game was played on April 9 against the Philadelphia Phillies, with Brooklyn losing, 1–0. 

When the park was opened it was discovered that an American flag, keys to the bleachers, and a press box had all been forgotten. The press box level was not added until 1929. The original double-decked seating covered all of right field, rounded home plate, and extended past third base, with an open concrete bleacher stand continuing to the left field wall. 

The ballpark was built on a sloping piece of ground, raised above street level in right field, which resulted in short foul line there of just ). When it opened, the field was very large for its time in both left field () and center (); with additional seating the playing field shrunk to in left, in center, and to right, which gained a screen above its fence and a scoreboard. At its peak it had a capacity of around 32,000.

As with Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park and Detroit&#x27;s Tiger Stadium, two ballparks that had opened one year earlier than Ebbets Field, the intimate configuration of some of each park&#x27;s dimensions prompted some baseball writers to also refer to Ebbets Field as a &quot;cigar box&quot; or a &quot;bandbox.&quot;

===Use===

Ebbets Field was the scene of some early successes, as the Dodgers, also called the &quot;Robins&quot; after long-time manager Wilbert Robinson, won National League championships in 1916 and 1920. The seating area was expanded in the 1920s, a boom time for baseball when many ballparks were expanded. The double deck was extended from third base around the left field corner, across left field, and into center field, allowing right-hand hitters to garner many more home runs. By the 1940s, a big scoreboard had been installed in right field, as well as a screen atop the high wall which made home runs to right field a tougher accomplishment. Additional rows of seating across left field reduced that area by about 15 feet, aiding right-handed hitters.

The park&#x27;s first night game was played on June 15, 1938, drawing a crowd of 38,748. Johnny Vander Meer of the visiting Cincinnati Reds pitched his second consecutive no-hitter, a feat that has never been duplicated in Major League Baseball. It was also in 1938 that Hilda Chester, one of the earlier sports &quot;superfans,&quot; became a regular attendee when promotional wizard Larry MacPhail brought Ladies&#x27; Days to Ebbets Field, welcoming women for only ten-cents.

After the Dodgers early successes the team slid into hard times. It remained there for two decades, until new ownership first brought in MacPhail in 1938, and then, after MacPhail&#x27;s wartime resignation, player development specialist Branch Rickey in 1943. In addition to his well-known breaking of the color line by signing Jackie Robinson in 1948, Rickey&#x27;s savvy with farm systems (which he had honed with the rival St. Louis Cardinals) produced results that made the Brooklyn Dodger &quot;Bums&quot; a perennial contender through their exit to California after the 1957 season.

The Dodgers won pennants in 1941 (under MacPhail), 1947, 1949, 1952, 1953, 1955 and 1956. They won the 1955 World Series, their only world title, and were within two games (in 1950) and a playoff heartbreak (in 1951) of winning five National League pennants in a row (1949–53), challenging the five time World Champion cross-town Yankees during that stretch. Ebbets Field also hosted the 1949 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.

===Demise===
The Dodgers found themselves victims of their own success soon thereafter, as Ebbets Field never seated more than 35,000 people, and the constraints of the neighborhood made its expansion impossible. It also had almost no automobile parking for Dodger fans who had moved east to suburban Long Island, though it was near a subway station. Walter O&#x27;Malley, who obtained majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, announced plans for a privately owned domed stadium at the Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn (currently the site of the Atlantic Terminal Mall), where a large market was being torn down. 

New York City Building Commissioner Robert Moses refused to help O&#x27;Malley secure the land, instead wanting the Dodgers to move to a city-owned stadium in Flushing Meadows in the borough of Queens (the future site of Shea Stadium and Citi Field). O&#x27;Malley refused to consider Moses&#x27; proposal, famously telling him &quot;We are the Brooklyn Dodgers, not the Queens Dodgers!&quot;

As a result, O&#x27;Malley began to flirt publicly with Los Angeles, using a relocation threat as political leverage to win favor for a Brooklyn stadium. Ultimately, O&#x27;Malley and Moses could not come to agreement on a new location for the stadium, and the club moved west to Los Angeles after the 1957 season. During their last two years in Brooklyn, the Dodgers played several games each year in Jersey City, New Jersey&#x27;s Roosevelt Stadium, which was a tactic by O&#x27;Malley to force Moses to acquiesce and allow a new stadium to be built.

Ebbets Field was sold by O&#x27;Malley to real estate developer Marvin Kratter for about $2,000,000 on October 31, 1956. The deal included a five-year lease that allowed the Dodgers to move out as soon as a proposed Downtown Brooklyn stadium was ready for business and Kratter to raze the ballpark and redevelop the land for a $25 million housing project beginning in 1961. When stadium plans fell through the team left for Los Angeles after the 1957 season.

To avoid being the only team west of St. Louis, O&#x27;Malley urged Horace Stoneham, owner of the Dodgers&#x27; long-time crosstown rivals, the New York Giants, to also move west: Stoneham, who was having stadium and financial difficulties of his own, agreed, and moved the Giants to San Francisco after the 1957 season.

The departure of the Dodgers was followed by a &quot;twilight&quot; phase in which the park sporadically hosted soccer, as well as high school, college, and a handful of Negro league baseball games featuring a team formed by ex-Dodger star Roy Campanella. In one of those games pitcher Satchel Paige made a special guest appearance.

The demolition of Ebbets Field began on February 23, 1960. More than 35 years after the Dodgers had left Brooklyn, a federal judge in the Southern District of New York presiding over a case deciding the use of the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; trademark called O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s relocation of the franchise from its historic home to Los Angeles &quot;one of the most notorious abandonments in the history of sports&quot;.

An auction of Ebbets Field&#x27;s structure and contents was held on April 20, 1960. An estimated 500 people bid on locker room stools, benches, team banners, seats, bricks, bats, caps, team photos, balls, and a brownstone cornerstone of the stadium.

===In subsequent years===
The Ebbets Field Apartments were built on the former ballpark site, opening in 1962, and remaining under private ownership. Middle School 320, across McKeever Place, was renamed Jackie Robinson Intermediate School. In January 2014, the street sign that once stood at the corner of McKeever Place and Montgomery Street was sold at auction for $58,852.08.

==Legacy==
Ebbets Field was one of several historic major league ballparks demolished in the 1960s. Of the many teams that uprooted in the 1950s and 1960s, the Dodgers&#x27; legacy perhaps has lingered the longest. Roger Kahn&#x27;s acclaimed book &quot;The Boys of Summer&quot; and Frank Sinatra&#x27;s song &quot;There Used to Be a Ballpark&quot; mourned the loss of places like Ebbets Field and their time. 

The story of Ebbets Field and the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; move to Los Angeles were further chronicled by historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, figured into the plot of the film &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, were featured in an entire episode of Ken Burns&#x27; acclaimed public-television documentary &quot;Baseball&quot;, as well as a 2007 HBO documentary called &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers: Ghosts of Flatbush&quot;.

By 2006 the Dodgers had played as many years in Dodger Stadium as they had at Ebbets Field, matched by the New York Mets&#x27; duration in Shea Stadium from 1964 to 2008.

When the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association moved to Brooklyn in 2012, marking a return of major-league professional sports to the borough after a 55-year absence, they installed the Ebbets Field flagpole in front of their home arena, the Barclays Center. 

===Other sports at Ebbets Field===
Ebbets Field was frequently used for collegiate football match-ups, and was home base for Manhattan College&#x27;s team in the 1930s. It also hosted three pro football teams – the New York Brickley Giants for one game in 1921, the Brooklyn Lions/Horsemen in 1926, and the Brooklyn Dodgers/Tigers from 1930 to 1944. 

On 1927, the soccer Club Nacional de Football in its North American tour played two games against Brooklyn Wanderers, winning both. The Nacionals fielded Olympic medal winners such as José Andrade and Héctor Scarone. 

The stadium also hosted numerous soccer games, including the U.S. National Challenge Cup soccer tournament, now known as the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Bethlehem Steel F.C. from Pennsylvania of the American Soccer League won its sixth and final National Challenge Cup title, on April 11, 1926, scoring a convincing 7–2 victory over Ben Miller F.C. of St. Louis in the final before more than 18,000 fans.

On June 7, 1931, over 10,000 fans came out to Ebbets Field to watch Celtic of Scotland defeat Brooklyn Wanderers 5–0.

On June 17, 1947, the first known televised soccer game in the US took place when Hapoel Tel Aviv lost to the American League Stars 2–0. On June 18, 1948, Liverpool of England beat Djurgården of Sweden 3–2 in front of 20,000 fans. On October 17 of that year, the U.S. national team beat the Israel national team in front of 25,000 fans. On May 8, 1955, Sunderland of England beat the American League Stars 7–2. On May 17, Sunderland drew 1-1 with 1. FC Nürnberg of Germany. 

On May 25, 1958, Manchester City of England lost to Hearts of Scotland 6–5 in front of more than 20,000 patrons. The winners received the Empire State Cup, which can be seen in the Heart of Midlothian FC Museum. On June 28, 1959, Napoli of Italy lost to Rapid Vienna of Austria 1–0 in front of 18,512, and game officials were attacked afterwards. At the rematch three days later in front of 13,000 people, Napoli tied Rapid Vienna 1–1, in one of the last events held there.

Gaelic football was also played at Ebbets Field. On June 24, 1931, the All-Ireland champion County Kerry team defeated Kildare by a score of 18–3 with an attendance of 2,500 fans under floodlights in a night game.

Ebbets Field also hosted nearly 90 fight cards between 1915 and 1947.

==Dimensions==

A detailed plan of the new ballpark was published in the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; for January 3, 1912, p. 21. The right field line was to be from home plate, the left field line , and to the front of the intended triangle-shaped center field bleachers the plan said &quot;+ or −&quot;.

When the ballpark opened in 1913, the outfield was bounded by bare concrete walls all around, which would soon be covered with advertising. The triangular center field was used for the flag pole, with just a short fence in front of it, no bleachers. There was a large door in deep right center field, at the one place where the outfield and the sloping Bedford Avenue were at the same elevation. By 1920, several rows of wooden bleachers had been constructed inside the left field wall, which the newspapers called &quot;circus seats&quot;.

In the spring of 1931, the Dodgers began expanding Ebbets Field. They demolished the old concrete bleachers beyond third base as well as the &quot;circus seats&quot;. They built an extension of the main double-deck stands, which stretched across left and center fields, leaving a notch for the big door in deep right center field. Once this work was done, the general layout was fairly well set. The left field corner had a unique arrangement, with the foul line actually running atop the box seat railing to the foul pole. A new door in left center field once had a sign reading . Above the street-exit door in the deep center field notch was a sign reading .

The last changes came in 1948, when several rows of seats were installed in front of the outfield stands, reducing the left and center dimensions to their final distances. The 399 marker above the deep center field door was painted over, while a 376 marker was added to the right corner of the seating area wall.

He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1975 and was a public servant and electorate secretary to Senator Gareth Evans before entering local politics serving as a councillor in the Coburg City Council from 1981 to 1988. He was the deputy mayor from 1983 to 1984 and 1987 to 1988.

Kelvin Thomson was married to Victorian Labor MP Marsha Thomson until they separated in 2003. They have two children.

==Politics==

===State parliament===
In October 1988, Thomson was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for the Pascoe Vale. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1992 to 1994, and in 1994 he served as the Manager of Opposition Business.

===Federal parliament===
In 1996, Thomson was elected to the seat of Wills, formerly a blue-ribbon Labor seat that had been held by Bob Hawke. However, it had become less safe for Labor. In 1992 the independent Phil Cleary won a by-election; and in 1993, although Labor retained government, Cleary again defeated the Labor candidate who received only 41.9% of the primary vote. In the 1996 election, in which Labor&#x27;s support decreased and Paul Keating&#x27;s government ended, Thomson became the Labor candidate and proved himself a strong campaigner. He won the seat, gaining 50.0% of the primary vote. In the 2007 election, which Labor won, Thomson achieved a swing, on the two-party-preferred vote of 5.5 points, and received 56.9% of the primary vote. In the 2010 election, which resulted in near defeat for Labor, Thomson like other Labor incumbents lost ground on the primary vote (51.81%); yet he achieved a further slight positive swing on the two-party preferred vote (0.24%).
In August 1997, Thomson joined the Opposition Shadow Ministry. From 2003 to 2004 he was Shadow Minister for the Environment and Heritage; Shadow Minister for Regional Development and Roads, Housing and Urban Development from 2004 to 2005; and in June 2005 he was appointed Shadow Minister for Public Accountability and Shadow Minister for Human Services. After the election of Kevin Rudd to party leadership in December 2006, Thomson was appointed to the position of Shadow Attorney-General.

On 9 March 2007, Kevin Rudd informed the media that his office had received an anonymous tip-off that back in 2000 Thomson had provided Melbourne gangland figure Tony Mokbel with a personal reference, saying he &quot;understood&quot; Mokbel had been married for the past eight years and also understood that Mokbel had been &quot;a responsible, caring husband and father&quot;. It was later revealed by the media that up until 2000, there had been only one mention of Tony Mokbel in the media, a positive article in the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; about the contributions Mokbel&#x27;s businesses made to the local economy in Moreland, in and near Thomson&#x27;s electorate of Wills; and that the National Australia Bank had regarded Mokbel as a legitimate property developer worth some $15 million, in whom they invested until his arrest in August 2001. Thomson resigned from Labor&#x27;s front bench after the reference became public. He also released the text of the letter, commenting that he did not know Mokbel and that &quot;the reference, as you will be able to see, was more of a pro-forma character (reference).&quot;

The Sydney Morning Herald coverage emphasized that Kevin Rudd was under pressure over &quot;allegations surrounding his past meetings with disgraced former Western Australian premier Brian Burke&quot;; and that Thomson &quot;had no choice but to resign, especially since [Prime Minister] John Howard raised the bar a week ago by sacking Ian Campbell for doing nothing more than the meeting, in his then-capacity as heritage minister, a delegation which included Burke.&quot; The same article suggested that the sort of reference Thomson had written was similar to thousands of pro forma references supplied by MPs to their constituents and that it was an open question whether Thomson &quot;would have suffered the same fate&quot; had he not moved, in the seven years since writing the reference, to the position of Shadow Attorney General. It also commented: &quot;Thomson&#x27;s relegation to the backbench will be a setback for Labor. Ever since December, when Rudd promoted him to shadow attorney-general, he has dealt the Government more grief over David Hicks than Labor did collectively over the previous five years. Of the big changes to Labor&#x27;s frontbench under Rudd, Thomson was the standout surprise performer.&quot; Thomson was not subsequently re-appointed to the Labor cabinet. He did subsequently chair the Parliament&#x27;s Treaties Committee and frequently served as acting Speaker.

Since 2009 Thomson&#x27;s speeches and media releases have often dealt with problems of Australian and global population growth. In August 2009, following a terrorist scare, Thomson attracted controversy with his comments regarding the link between high immigration and allegedly poor screening of immigrants for terrorism. Thomson repeated his call to cut immigration levels in September 2009 following the release of a report indicating that the population of Australia would grow to 35 million by 2049. Thomson said that Australia was &quot;sleepwalking into an environmental disaster&quot;, and predicted that such a population would tend to outgrow its resources of &quot;food, water, energy and land&quot;.

He has since been an advocate for sustainable population levels in Australia, and in November 2009 proposed a 14 Point Plan for Population Reform. This aims to stabilize Australia&#x27;s population at 26 million by reducing skilled immigration and cutting the net overseas migration program to 70,000 per annum. The plan would also &quot;abolish the Baby Bonus&quot; but increase the refugee program from 13,750 to 20,000 per annum. (The Labor government has since, in 2012, announced an increase to 20,000.)

Kelvin Thomson describes himself as a keen environmentalist and naturalist; and as an MP he has been strongly anti-nuclear, pro sustainable population, and pro-action on climate change. In 2011 and 2012 he was prominent in leading opposition inside the Australian Federal Parliament to the export of live cattle and sheep for meat. In October 2012, Thomson&#x27;s call for a ban on political donations by developers received backing from the Melbourne &quot;Age&quot;. In 2012 he voted against the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill. In 2017 he was awarded the Alan Missen Award for Integrity in Serving Parliament by the Accountability Roundtable.

In 2012 Emeritus Professor Ian Lowe, president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, examined Labor&#x27;s views on population and environment in his book &quot;Bigger or Better?&quot; Lowe found Labor&#x27;s stated and de facto population policies, like those of the Liberal Party, to be confused and inconsistent. Lowe argued that these were distorted by a pro-growth ideology that was in conflict with the evidence, and by a failure to understand the infrastructure costs of rapid population growth. By contrast he discussed and commended the arguments in four separate papers by Thomson, noting that collectively these proved that &quot;Thomson is not a &#x27;one-trick pony&#x27; obsessed with population to the exclusion of other important issues, but a politician who is thinking deeply about our security and ways to ensure a better future&quot;. Lowe also expressed surprise that so much had been made of &quot;Thomson&#x27;s anodyne reference&quot; for Mokbel, given that Thomson had done &quot;what most MP&#x27;s do quite routinely, writing a reference for a constituent&quot;.

During his time in Parliament, Thomson spoke out against criminal activities in the gambling industry.
===Political theorist===
Since 2008 Thomson has emerged as a political theorist, whose speeches and articles question some of the Labor Party&#x27;s current directions and call for reforms.

His analysis begins by noting the exceptional speed of Australia&#x27;s population growth since 2000. On this he cites the demographer Graeme Hugo who has described it as more than three times the average annual increase of industrialised countries. In a series of papers and speeches collected on his website, Thomson argues that such rapid growth imposes high costs upon government budgets, upon natural and urban environments, and upon citizens&#x27; finances and lifestyle. Thomson concedes that Labor will not quickly change its pro-growth stance or embrace &quot;population reform&quot;, but argues that there is no other solution because the rate of population growth is impoverishing State governments and leading to widespread discontent among voters.

Answering those who imagine Labor could solve this problem by better planning or by allocating more funds, Thomson suggests they do not understand the crippling effect of the infrastructure costs imposed by population growth. On this, he cites the work of US economist Lester Thurow and University of Queensland agricultural economist Jane N. O&#x27;Sullivan. O&#x27;Sullivan has argued that these costs, amounting to some A$200,000 of infrastructure per extra Australian, dwarf the supposed economic advantages. Thomson believes this largely explains why Anna Bligh&#x27;s seemingly competent Queensland State government suffered the worst defeat of a sitting government in Queensland history, when it was forced to alienate voters by selling off public assets even during an economic boom, and yet could not satisfy the population&#x27;s demand for infrastructure. He suggests that, &quot;Instead of talking about population size, we should examine the economic impacts of ... population &quot;growth rate&quot;.&quot;

In a speech in Parliament in March 2012 he recommended to his colleagues a paper by O&#x27;Sullivan in &quot;Economic Affairs&quot; as crucial reading &quot;for anyone who seriously wants to understand ...why governments of all persuasions struggle to meet people&#x27;s needs and expectations.&quot; Thomson argued that since about 2% of existing infrastructure comes up for renewal each year, and this is a cost governments struggle to pay, a mere 1% annual increase in population may impose an almost unpayable increase of up to 50% in infrastructure costs:

A society with a stable population needs to replace two per cent of all infrastructure annually. But if a population is growing at one per cent per annum, for example ...this increases the burden of infrastructure creation by some 50 per cent. ...One per cent more GDP or tax cannot pay for 25 to 50 per cent more public infrastructure. 

Thomson had already generalised this analysis in his August 2011 paper &quot;The Witches’ Hats Theory of Government: How increasing population is making the task of government harder&quot;. Here Thomson suggested that one reason many politicians around the world imposed policies to promote population growth was that they did not realise how likely it was to shorten their own political longevity. He assembled evidence suggesting that worldwide there is an inverse statistical connection between population growth and how long a given government is likely to last.

===Retirement from politics===
On 10 November 2015, Thomson announced he would retire from politics at the 2016 federal election. He held his seat of Wills between 1996 and 2016, and was succeeded in the seat by Peter Khalil. In December 2016 he announced that he was joining the Alliance for Gambling Reform as a campaign manager.

In January 2019, Thomson joined Sustainable Australia as an advisor to MLC Clifford Hayes.

Cariou made his first appearance in &quot;Damn Yankees&quot; at Rainbow Stage in Winnipeg in 1959, and was a founding member of the Manitoba Theatre Centre. He was offered a scholarship at the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal but, married with a young child and financial responsibilities, he was forced to decline the honor. Instead, he learned his craft by spending two years at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, and returned in 1981 to lead the company as Prospero, Coriolanus, Brutus, and Petruchio.

Cariou also became a lead actor at the Tyrone Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis in the 1960s, where he played Orlando in &quot;As You Like It&quot;; Agamemnon in Tyrone Guthrie&#x27;s compilation of &quot;The House of Atreus&quot;; Iago; Oberon; and the title roles in &quot;Henry V&quot;, &quot;Oedipus the King&quot;, and &quot;King Lear&quot;. He also was an associate director.In 1968, Cariou made his Broadway debut in &quot;The House of Atreus&quot;. Two years later, Cariou landed his first starring role opposite Lauren Bacall in &quot;Applause&quot;, a musical adaptation of the film &quot;All About Eve&quot;. It earned him a Tony Award nomination as Best Actor in a Musical and won him the Theatre World Award.

In 1973, he received his second Tony nomination for &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;; he reprised the role of Fredrik for the 1977 film version opposite Elizabeth Taylor. Six years later he won both the Tony and Drama Desk Award for his portrayal of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot; in the Stephen Sondheim musical opposite Angela Lansbury. Cariou&#x27;s early film credits include &quot;One Man&quot; (1977), and the 1977 Harold Prince-directed screen adaptation of &quot;A Little Night Music&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor.

=== 1980–1999 ===
In 1981 Cariou starred in the Alan Alda directed comedy-drama &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; alongside Carol Burnett, Rita Moreno, and Sandy Dennis. During these years, Cariou also appeared in a number of benefits, including &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; for the Riverside Shakespeare Company in New York, playing Scrooge, with Helen Hayes, Raul Julia, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, directed by W. Stuart McDowell at the Symphony Space in 1985. His next projects included the Alan Jay Lerner–Charles Strouse musical &quot;Dance a Little Closer&quot; (1983), Arthur Miller&#x27;s sole musical, &quot;Up from Paradise&quot; (1983), &quot;Teddy &amp; Alice&quot; (1987), and &quot;Ziegfeld&quot; (1988).

Regionally, Cariou has starred in many productions at theatres throughout North America, including The Kennedy Centre, the Mark Taper Forum, Lincoln Centre, the Long Wharf Theatre and the Old Globe.

Cariou appeared at The Geffen Theatre as Joe Keller in a notable production of &quot;All My Sons&quot;, a role he reprised in 2009 at the Gate Theatre in Dublin, where it was the longest-running, highest-grossing run of a play in that theatre&#x27;s history. He also appeared at The Geffen in Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;Rose and Walsh&quot; and &quot;Heroes&quot; with George Segal.

From 1985 to 1992, Cariou appeared in multiple episodes of the popular television mystery series &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; with his friend and former &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; co-star Angela Lansbury. Cariou portrayed the recurring character of Michael Hagarty, characterized as an Irish international man of mystery who worked as a secret agent for British MI-6. He would get Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury), the title character of the show, involved in mysteries involving international intrigue.

<text>Patea ( ) is the third-largest town in South Taranaki District, New Zealand. It is on the western bank of the Pātea River, 61 kilometres north-west of Whanganui on . Hāwera is 27 km to the north-west, and Waverley 17 km to the east. The Pātea River flows through the town from the north-east and into the South Taranaki Bight.

==History and culture==

===Pre-European history===
Patea is the traditional final place where some Māori led by Turi aboard the &quot;Aotea&quot; settled, after it was beached at the Aotea Harbour.

===European settlement===
Patea, called Carlyle or Carlyle Beach for a time by European settlers, was originally nearer the Pātea River mouth than the present town. During the New Zealand Wars Patea was an important military settlement. General Cameron&#x27;s force arrived at the river mouth on 15 January 1865 and constructed redoubts on both sides of the river.

Patea became a market town when hostilities ended. The first of the sections on the present town site were sold in 1870. A local shipping company was established in 1872, and harbour improvements began. The Marton-New Plymouth railway line via Patea was completed in March 1885. The Carlyle Town Board, created about 1877 to administer town affairs, was succeeded by a borough council constituted on 13 October 1881 under the name Patea.

In the 1920s, Patea was the largest cheese exporting port in the world. The Grader Cool Store received cheese for grading from all over South Taranaki and as far south as Oroua Downs near Himatangi. After grading it was loaded into coastal ships at the grader wharf for transport to Wellington where it was transhipped into overseas ships for export. The port closed in July 1959.

===Patea Freezing Works===

In the early 1880s the predecessor to the Patea Freezing Works was established on the eastern bank of the Pātea River. Cool stores for handling dairy produce followed in 1901 with later additions evolving into what became known as the Patea Freezing Co-Op, South Taranaki&#x27;s primary employer. Strategic reforms, inefficiencies and nationwide over-processing resulted in closure in September 1982. In February 2008 the derelict buildings suffered severe fires. The damage was extensive and with the health hazard presented by asbestos insulation throughout the freezer walls, the town sought demolition.

===Patea Māori Club===

Patea became known in 1984 as the home of singer Dalvanius Prime and the Pātea Māori Club. Their single, &quot;Poi E&quot;, indicated renewed impetus in contemporary Māori popular music.

===Recent history===

Patea has retained a strong community focus and enjoys many services including a well-resourced medical centre, public swimming pool and trust-owned rest home. The town is also the location of Aotea Utanganui - Museum of South Taranaki.

Several kilometres east of Patea is the small community of Whenuakura, where New Zealand golfer Michael Campbell lived as a child. He learned to play golf at the Patea Golf Club, on the cliffs overlooking the Tasman Sea. He crowned his professional career by winning the U.S. Open in June 2005, and three months later the HSBC World Match Play Championship.

===Marae===
The local Wai o Turi marae and Rangiharuru meeting house are affiliated with the Ngā Rauru hapū of Rangitāwhi.

In October 2020, the Government committed $298,680 from the Provincial Growth Fund to reconstruct the accessway to the marae and expand the carpark, creating 8 jobs.

<text>Costeaning is the process by which miners seek to discover metallic lodes. It consists in sinking small pits through the superficial deposits to the solid rock, and then driving from one pit to another across the direction of the vein, in such manner as to cross all the veins between the two pits.

In the Northern Territory of Australia, costeans are required to be excavated in a way which reduces disturbance to the environment.

<text>Burning Chrome (1986) is a collection of short stories written by William Gibson. Three of the stories take place in Gibson&#x27;s Sprawl, a shared setting for most of his early cyberpunk work. Many of the ideas and themes explored in the short stories were later revisited in Gibson&#x27;s popular Sprawl trilogy.

==Contents==
&quot;Burning Chrome&quot; includes:
==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;this was a collection which had to appear—even if three collaborations and an over-arty first published story are needed to fill it out. They&#x27;re strong, punchy tales which his glittering &#x27;technosleaze&#x27; trademark: some are obvious precursors of the novels, and the fine title piece&#x27;s hair-raising cyberspace jaunt is echoed all too closely in &quot;Neuromancer&quot;.&quot;

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 82. Caparula commented that &quot;This is vital reading; harsh, gritty, complex, visionary.&quot;

<doc id="625958" wikidata="Q1149078" url="?curid=625958" title="Sparkler">
<text>A sparkler is a type of hand-held firework that burns slowly while emitting bright, colored sparks. It burns in high temperature (over 1000°C), so it can be very dangerous. 

Sparklers are particularly popular with children. In the United Kingdom, a sparkler is often used by children at bonfire and fireworks displays on Guy Fawkes Night, the fifth of November, and in the United States on Independence Day. They are called &quot;phuljhadi&quot; in Hindi and are especially popular during the Diwali festival.

== Composition ==

Sparklers are generally formed around a thin non-combustible metallic wire, about long, that has been dipped in a thick batter of slow-burning pyrotechnic composition and allowed to dry. The combustible coating contains the following components; multiple ingredients can be used:
* Metallic fuel, main reactive ingredient; type of metals influences the color of sparks; size of particles influences shape and size of the sparks
** Aluminium, magnesium or magnalium, for white sparks
** Iron, for orange branching sparks
** Titanium, for rich white sparks
** Ferrotitanium, for yellow-gold sparks
* Oxidizer, main reactive ingredient
** Potassium nitrate
** Barium nitrate
** Strontium nitrate
** Potassium perchlorate, more powerful but potentially explosive
** Ammonium perchlorate
* Combustible binder, to hold the composition together
** Dextrin
** Nitrocellulose
* Additional fuel (optional), to modify the burning speed
** Sulfur
** Charcoal
* Pyrotechnic colorants (optional), to color the sparks 
** chlorides and nitrates of metals, e.g. barium, strontium, or copper

The colored spot on the top of each rod indicates the color of the sparkles emitted when ignited.

== Uses ==
Sparklers are usually used for celebrations. They can be used for light painting. Due to the high (over 1000°C) burning temperature of certain composition, they can also be used to ignite thermite.

==Safety issues==
A 2009 report from the National Council on Fireworks Safety indicated that sparklers are responsible for 16 percent of legal firework-related injuries in the United States. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission&#x27;s statistics from the Fourth of July festivities in 2003 indicate that sparklers were involved in a majority (57%) of fireworks injuries sustained by children under five years of age.

Subsequent reports from the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission about &quot;Fireworks-Related Deaths, Emergency Department-Treated Injuries, and Enforcement Activities&quot; indicate:
The devices burn at a high temperature (as hot as 1000°C to 1600°C, or 1800°F to 3000°F), depending on the fuel and oxidizer used, more than sufficient to cause severe skin burns or ignite clothing. Safety experts recommend that adults ensure children who handle sparklers be properly warned, supervised and wearing non-flammable clothing. As with all fireworks, sparklers are also capable of accidentally initiating wildfires. This is especially true in drier areas; in Australia, for instance, sparkler-related bushfire accidents have led to their banning at public outdoor events during summer like Australia Day celebrations.

Sparkler bombs are home-made devices constructed by binding together as many as 300 sparklers with tape, leaving one extended to use as a fuse. In 2008, three deaths were attributed to the devices, which can be ignited accidentally by heat or friction. Since they usually contain more than 50 milligrams of the same explosive powder found in firecrackers, they are illegal under U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) regulations.

==In art and popular culture==
An art group, Monochrom, was planning to light 10,000 bound sparklers which it described as &quot;symbolic liberation&quot; to reflect that sparklers are generally used in monotheistic traditions. 
A large group from Toronto, Ontario, Canada also held an event displaying 10,000 sparklers to symbolize brightness, intensity, warmth and creativity.
In 1999, the two artists Tobias Kipp and Timo Pitkämö developed a technique of drawing portraits with burning sparklers on paper, which they called pyrografie. Since then the two artists have drawn more than 20,000 pyroportraits.

<text>Sarah Rice (March 5, 1955 – January 6, 2024) was an American theatre actress known for her work in the Stephen Sondheim productions &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; and &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;, the former of which won her a Theatre World Award in 1979.

==Early life==
Rice was born in Okinawa, Japan, while her father was serving in the U.S. Air Force there. Before her first birthday, the family moved to Arizona, where she, a sister, and two brothers grew up. Rice acted in some amateur productions and attended college for one year before she moved to New York at age 18.

==Career==
Although Rice initially sought to use her ballet training to perform in classical dance, one of her early roles was that of Luisa in &quot;The Fantasticks.&quot; On Broadway, she created the original role of Johanna in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; (1979). She is also known for her Montreal performance of John Kenley and Robert Noll&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera-The Play&quot;, and her operatic performances in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and &quot;The Student Prince&quot; She performed with, among others, Michigan Opera Theater, Central City Opera, and the Santa Fe Opera.

Sarah was also a beloved presence on the New York cabaret circuit. She won a 2010 Bistro Award and 2011 MAC Award (Female Vocalist) for her critically acclaimed solo cabaret debut, SCREEN GEMS: Songs of Old Hollywood. She also created and performed an Ivor Novello/Noel Coward show, GLAMOROUS NIGHTS &amp; CARELESS RAPTURE, celebrating the music of the era of Downton Abbey, and MUSIC OF THE NIGHT, in which she sang and played the Theremin. (Sarah was attracted to, and learned to play, the Theremin, unique among musical instruments since it is played without physical contact. She captivated audiences who watched her play radio waves in the air.) She made many guest appearances in the award-winning SONDHEIM UNPLUGGED series at 54 Below. Her voice can be heard on the Grammy-nominated SONDHEIM UNPLUGGED recording. She was a part of The Mabel Mercer Foundation’s Cabaret Convention several times, including their Sondheim Evening.
In 2019, Sarah, together with fellow Broadway stars Carole Demas and Hal Robinson, created THANK YOU FOR YOUR LOVE, a celebration of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt, with whom they had all worked on numerous shows over many decades, including THE FANTASTICKS. The show was honored with a Bistro Award. 

==Personal life and death==
Rice died from cancer on January 6, 2024, at the age of 68, in New York City.

<doc id="625962" wikidata="Q5230005" url="?curid=625962" title="Dave Tollner">
<text>David William Tollner (born 31 January 1966) is an Australian politician. He was the Country Liberal Party member for Solomon in the Australian House of Representatives from 2001 to 2007, and then served in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly as the member for Fong Lim from 2008 to 2016. He was the Deputy Chief Minister of the Northern Territory under chief minister Adam Giles from 2013 to 2014. During his time in federal parliament, he sat with the Liberal Party.

==Early life and federal politics==
Tollner was born in Biloela, Queensland, and worked as a manager and company director before entering politics. He contested the 1997 territory election as an independent, narrowly losing to CLP candidate Chris Lugg in the seat of Nelson. He subsequently won the new federal seat of Solomon for the CLP at the 2001 federal election, and was re-elected at the 2004 election. He was narrowly defeated by Labor candidate Damian Hale at the 2007 election.

Tollner sat with the Liberal Party in federal parliament during his time as member for Solomon.

==Territory politics==

Tollner then contested the 2008 territory election, winning the new seat of Fong Lim and defeating Labor minister Matthew Bonson. He was re-elected at the 2012 election, and upon the CLP&#x27;s victory was appointed Minister for Health, Minister for Alcohol Rehabilitation and Policy, and Minister for Housing. In March 2013, Mills expelled Tollner from his cabinet after a heated disagreement between the two at a party meeting. According to former MLA Daryl Manzie, Tollner swore at Mills and threw a stack of cabinet papers at him before walking out of the room.

Tollner was appointed deputy chief minister of the Northern Territory on 13 March 2013. He caused controversy in August 2014 when he referred to the gay son of fellow CLP MP Gary Higgins as a &quot;pillow biter&quot; and &quot;shirt lifter&quot;. As a result, it was announced that Tollner&#x27;s resignation as deputy leader of the CLP had been accepted. Despite that, Tollner said a few days later that he wanted to be restored to his former position or he would quit the party, leaving it in a precarious position on the floor of the Legislative Assembly. On 1 September, Chief Minister Adam Giles threw open the leadership and deputy leadership to a party room ballot. Giles was re-elected as CLP leader, and Peter Chandler was voted in as his deputy. He has also been accused of making racist comments; in 2014 he was accused of calling two women &quot;lubras&quot;, which is a racial slur targeted at Indigenous women.

A redistribution ahead of the 2016 election all but erased Tollner&#x27;s majority in Fong Lim, slashing it from a fairly safe 7.3 percent to an extremely marginal 0.2 percent. Tollner tried to transfer to the newly created seat of Spillett, which had absorbed much of the eastern portion of Fong Lim. However, he lost a November 2015 preselection battle to Lia Finocchiaro, the member for neighbouring Drysdale. His senior advisor, Tim Dixon, was pre-selected for Fong Lim, but lost the seat to Labor.

<text>Central European University (CEU; , ) is a private research university with a campus in Vienna and a non-degree, research and civic engagement presence in Budapest. The university offers graduate and undergraduate programs in the social sciences and humanities, which are accredited in Austria and the United States.

CEU was founded in 1991 by hedge fund manager, political activist, and billionaire philanthropist George Soros, who provided it with a $250 million endowment in 2001, making the university one of the wealthiest in Europe, especially on a per-student basis. The university is considered academically elite and prestigious.

The university was founded in Central Europe because of a perceived need for an independent and international university for the region, in light of the fall of the Socialist Bloc and concomitant democratisation. A central tenet of the university&#x27;s mission is the promotion of open societies, a result of its close association with the Open Society Foundations. It is a member of The European University of Social Sciences and Europaeum.

==History==
===Early years (1989-1993) ===

CEU evolved from a series of lectures held at the in Dubrovnik, Yugoslavia, (now Croatia). In Spring 1989, as historic change was gathering momentum in the region, the need for a new, independent, international university was being considered. The minutes of the gathering held in April 1989 record a discussion among scholars such as , , Márton Tardos, István Teplán, Miklós Vámos and Miklós Vásárhelyi from Budapest, William Newton-Smith and Kathleen Wilkes from Oxford, Jan Havranek, Michal Illner and Jiří Kořalka from Prague, and Krzysztof Michalski and Włodzimierz Siwiński from Warsaw. In 1989–90, a serious attempt was undertaken to establish Central European University in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, but it fell through due to nationalist politicians&#x27; opposition.

The university was founded in 1991 in response to the fall of the Socialist Bloc. The founding vision was to create a university dedicated to examining the contemporary challenges of &quot;open societies&quot; and democratization. The initial aim was to create a Western-modeled yet distinctly Central European institution that would foster inter-regional cooperation and educate a new corps of regional leaders to help usher in democratic transitions across the region. CEU was set up in Budapest, Prague, and Warsaw. It was originally located mostly in Prague, but because of &quot;political and financial conflict between its founder and [the] Czech government&quot;, represented by then prime minister Vaclav Klaus, in January 1993 it was moved to Budapest.
=== Budapest (1993-2019) ===
In its second decade, CEU broadened its focus from regional to global, with a special emphasis on democracy promotion and human rights around the world. It has since developed a distinct academic approach, combining regional studies with an international perspective, emphasizing comparative and interdisciplinary research in order to generate new scholarship and policy initiatives, and to promote good governance and the rule of law. CEU has extended its outreach and financial aid programs to certain areas of the developing world.CEU began the region&#x27;s first master&#x27;s degree programs in gender studies and environmental sciences. The CEU Center for Media, Data and Society (now the newly independent Media and Journalism Research Center) is the leading center of research on media, communication, and information policy in the region. On 14 October 2007, George Soros stepped down as chairman of CEU Board. Leon Botstein (president of Bard College, New York), who had previously served as the vice-chair of the board, was elected as new chairman for a two-year term. George Soros is a Life-CEU trustee and serves as honorary chairman of the board.On 1 August 2009, Rector Yehuda Elkana was succeeded by human rights leader and legal scholar John Shattuck. On 5 May 2016, it was announced that Michael Ignatieff would succeed Shattuck, becoming the fifth president and rector of the university. Ignatieff&#x27;s inauguration took place at the university&#x27;s new auditorium on 21 October 2017.

==== Government contests status ====
On 28 March 2017, Hungarian Minister of Human Resources Zoltán Balog, also responsible for education, submitted a bill to Parliament to amend Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education. The bill aimed to introduce new regulations for foreign-operating universities, several of which affect CEU. Notably, such universities could only operate if the Hungarian government has an agreement with the university&#x27;s other country of operation (in the case of CEU, the agreement is between the State of New York and the city of Budapest). In addition, universities operating outside of the European Union should have a campus in their other country of operation, where comparable degree programs would be offered (in 2017 it was not the case for CEU). Furthermore, both existing and new non-EU academic staff would be required to apply for work permits. This requirement is seen by critics as placing CEU at a particular disadvantage, given that it relies largely on non-EU faculty. Finally, the law would also prohibit the American and Hungarian entities from sharing the same name.

CEU issued a statement expressing its opposition to the bill, noting that &quot;these amendments [to Act CCIV of 2011 on National Higher Education] would make it impossible for the University to continue its operations as an institution of higher education in Budapest, CEU&#x27;s home for 25 years&quot;, and that &quot;CEU is in full conformity with Hungarian law.&quot;

The same day, the pro-government news website Origo.hu published an article asserting that CEU, to which it referred as &quot;Soros University&quot; (George Soros being its founder and main benefactor, and also known as an opponent of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán and his Fidesz party), operated unlawfully in Hungary, citing regulatory infractions. The article also referred to a report prepared by Hungary&#x27;s Educational Authority, which revealed that 28 universities, including CEU, were being investigated for operating unlawfully in Hungary. CEU issued a statement in response to the article, claiming the allegations of cheating and regulatory infractions constituted defamations and libel, and threatened to sue the website if the article was not corrected.

On 29 March 2017 Ignatieff, the President and Rector of CEU, Pro-Rector for Hungarian Affairs Zsolt Enyedi and Pro-Rector for Social Sciences and Humanities Éva Fodor held a press conference. Ignatieff said, among other things, that &quot;the legislation tabled by the Hungarian government relating to higher education is targeted and discriminatory, attacks the CEU, and is an unacceptable assault on our academic freedom&quot;, and &quot;the academic freedom of Hungarian higher education in general&quot;. Later, Ignatieff and Enyedi met Secretary of State for Education László Palkovics. CEU issued a statement thereafter, calling &quot;for the government to withdraw this legislation and enter into negotiations to find a solution.&quot;

On 31 March 2017, Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán stated in an interview on public radio that the future of &quot;Soros University&quot; depended on US-Hungarian talks. He said that CEU was &quot;cheating&quot; by awarding both Hungarian and American degrees, despite not operating abroad. This was a breach of Hungarian regulations, which gave an unfair advantage to CEU over the other 21 foreign universities in Hungary. In response to those claims, CEU issued a statement rejecting the suggestion that it was cheating and in breach of Hungarian regulations. Indeed, according to CEU, no laws in effect required universities such as CEU to also operate in their countries of origin. However, Szilard Nemeth, vice chairman of Fidesz, was more blunt, stating that civil society groups with funding from Soros should be &quot;swept out&quot; of Hungary.

On the same day, the first Trump administration released a statement expressing concern about the proposed legislation, which would &quot;negatively affect or even lead to the closure of Central European University (CEU) in Budapest&quot;, and urging the Hungarian government not to take &quot;any legislative action that would compromise CEU&#x27;s operations or independence.&quot;

Hungary&#x27;s ombudsman for educational rights Lajos Aary-Tamas called the amendment to the Higher Education Law &quot;discriminatory against CEU&quot;, and said that during his 17 years in office he had never received any complaint about CEU&#x27;s legal status. Hungarian EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth Tibor Navracsics, and former President of Hungary László Sólyom also expressed support.

Academics and academic institutions from Hungary, Latvia, Poland, Russia, Romania, Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries have expressed support for CEU. CEU itself has started a campaign of support, with the slogans #aCEUvalvagyok Central European University in Hungarian and #IstandwithCEU Central European University in English. The campaign uses social media to call on supporters to express their solidarity to CEU and write to Hungarian representatives.

British author Tibor Fischer expressed his support for the legislation passed on the initiative of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government, which affects CEU as well as all other Hungarian universities. Fischer defended Orban against &quot;charges of antisemitism&quot;, indicating that the government &quot;introduced Holocaust education into schools, passed a Holocaust denial law and...financed &quot;Son of Saul&quot;, a film about Auschwitz that [went on to win] an Oscar.&quot; He specified that he opposes the practice whereby the CEU, being registered in New York City, can issue a diploma accredited in the United States but without actually operating a campus in America within the provisions of the law as every other Hungarian campus, a situation that he named as CEU students &quot;getting a double bubble.&quot;2017 Protests in Hungary were held on April 2 in the form of a walk from Budapest&#x27;s Corvinus University to Parliament, passing by Eötvös Loránd University and CEU. The demonstration brought together thousands of protesters according to Reuters, with protest speeches held by both CEU and foreign academics and activists, and was broadcast live on Facebook by Hír TV.In the wake of the new Hungarian legislation, the Czech Minister of Finance Andrej Babiš proposed the CEU be moved to Prague, Czech Republic, offering particular buildings in the centre of the city that the university might use.

On 3 April 2017, CEU submitted a legal memorandum to the Hungarian Parliament, raising substantial issues about the legality and constitutionality of the proposed amendment to Act CCIV of 2011 on national higher education, and pledged to continue to contest this law using all available legal means in Hungary and in the EU. On the same day, the Hungarian parliament decided to debate and vote on the draft bill the following day, after a request by Deputy Prime Minister Zsolt Semjén, also head of the Christian Democrats, the junior party in the government coalition. Semjén said his request was justified by &quot;government interests to pass the law early.&quot;

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Mr. Orban has long viewed the school as a bastion of liberalism, presenting a threat to his vision of creating an &#x27;illiberal democracy,&#x27; and his desire to shut it down was only deepened by its association with Mr. Soros, a philanthropist who was born in Hungary. [He] has spent years demonizing Mr. Soros, a Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Hungary, accusing him of seeking to destroy European civilization by promoting illegal immigration, and often tapping into anti-Semitic tropes.&quot; Vox wrote that CEU &quot;was a casualty of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&#x27;s turn toward authoritarianism, his development of a quietly repressive system that I&#x27;ve termed &#x27;soft fascism&#x27;. CEU, a university dedicated to liberal principles and founded by Hungarian-American billionaire George Soros, posed a threat to Orbán&#x27;s ideological project. So Orbán put into place a set of characteristically sneaky regulations aimed at forcing out CEU without needing to formally ban them, eventually crushing the university&#x27;s ability to operate.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; commented that CEU &quot;has become the prime target of Orban&#x27;s campaign to dismantle Europe&#x27;s multicultural, tolerant liberalism and cement a culture that is unapologetically Christian, conservative, and nationalist.&quot;

=== Vienna (2019-present) ===
On 3 December 2018 the university announced it would relocate the majority of its operations to Vienna in September 2019, after the Hungarian government&#x27;s refusal to sign an agreement allowing it to continue teaching its US-accredited programs in Hungary. Less than one fifth of CEU&#x27;s programs, that are locally accredited, would remain in Budapest. &quot;The university retains accreditation as a Hungarian university and has sought to continue teaching and research activity in Budapest as long as possible, with current students completing their studies in Budapest.After failing to promote a deal between the US and Hungary that would keep the CEU in Budapest, US Ambassador to Hungary, David Cornstein, an appointee of the first Trump administration, said on 30 November that the whole issue &quot;had to do with [Orban and Soros]. It had nothing to do with academic freedom or civil liberties&quot;.

This withdrawal is the result of a long legal battle between the university and Viktor Orbán&#x27;s government, and is set in the wider context of contemporary Hungarian politics. This situation has sparked discourse regarding academic freedom in Hungary, and spurred widespread protests in favour of CEU. On 6 October 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that the &quot;lex CEU&quot; legislation, drawn up by the Hungarian government, was incompatible with European Union law.

In June 2021, Ignatieff announced that he would be stepping down as president and rector of the university, and that Shalini Randeria would succeed him as the sixth rector and president. Randeria is the first woman to serve in this role at the university.

In October 2023, Russia designated the university as an &#x27;undesirable&#x27; organization.

In the context of Hamas&#x27; attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the subsequent war in Israel and Gaza, there were repeated incidents at the CEU that were classified as antisemitic by various organizations. A series of events planned in cooperation with the University of Vienna, at which BDS activists were also due to speak, was canceled by the University of Vienna, nevertheless took place at the CEU. A lecture at the CEU entitled &quot;CEU Talks: Hamas&#x27; 7 October Attack, Terrorism Strategy and State-building&quot; was massively disrupted by students despite the presence of Rector Shalini Randeria. In a press release, the Austrian Union of Jewish Students (JÖH) and the European Union of Jewish Students (EUJS) accused the CEU of ignoring the threat to Jewish students and that the Rector was refusing to meet with Jewish student representatives. 

CEU published a statement clarifying that the university does not tolerate antisemitism or all forms of hate speech, or any form of harassment or discrimination. The statement clarified that the university has processes in place to ensure that its students can report any incidents of antisemitism as well as all other forms of ethnic or religious hate speech, which are dealt with by its internal mechanisms within the parameters set out by CEU&#x27;s Code of Ethics. CEU’s founding mission in defence of open societies enjoins it to protect critical discussion, and the freedom to scrutinize competing ideas. Such academic freedom includes the freedom to dissent respectfully and to expound controversial ideas within the bounds of legality and civility.

==Academics==

=== Admission ===
Admission into CEU programs is highly selective. In 2021, the admission rate of the university was 13%. As of 2019, 1217 students were enrolled in the university, of which 962 were international students, making the student body the fourth most international in the world. CEU offers doctoral programmes in 13 different subjects and master&#x27;s programmes in 37 different subjects, in addition to 3 interdisciplinary bachelor&#x27;s programmes. All programmes at CEU have a heavy research focus, and all courses are delivered in small, seminar-style classes, emphasising a low student-faculty ratio of 7 to 1.

===Rankings===
Until the 2019–2020 academic year, CEU was exclusively a postgraduate university and therefore not eligible for general world university rankings. Two new bachelor&#x27;s degree programs were introduced in the 2020–2021 academic year.

Regardless of this limitation due to the intentionally small size and specialised nature of the university, CEU has consistently performed well in subject rankings produced by various publishers. CEU has particular strength in disciplines such as political science, international relations, philosophy, history, and public policy, among others.

In 2014, the university&#x27;s Economics department was ranked 8th in Europe by the European Research Council (ERC), based on research excellence. Of the three European Research Council Starting Investigator Grant that came to Hungary two were awarded to CEU faculty.

CEU&#x27;s Department of Legal Studies was ranked first in Central Europe by the Czech newspaper, &quot;Lidové noviny&quot;. The survey included Austrian, Czech, German, Hungarian, Polish, and Slovak universities.

===Accreditation===
CEU is organized as an American-style institution, governed by a board of trustees, with a charter from the Board of Regents of the University of the State of New York, for and on behalf of the New York State Education Department. In the United States, CEU is accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. In Hungary, CEU is officially recognized as a privately maintained and operated university. The university was accredited by the Hungarian Accreditation Committee in 2004. In Austria, CEU is recognized as a private higher education institution, pursuant to section 7 of the Decree on Accreditation of Private Universities (PU-AkkVO). Central European University Private University (CEU PU) is accredited by the Agency for Quality Assurance and Accreditation Austria.

==Facilities==

=== Library ===

The CEU Library has a large English-language print collection of more than 150,000 documents and over 50,000 e-journals and 200,000 e-books.

=== Archives ===
The Blinken Open Society Archives (OSA) at CEU is a Cold War research facility, holding over 7,500 linear meters of material, 11,000 hours of audiovisual recordings and 12 terabytes of data related to communist-era political, social, economic and cultural life. OSA&#x27;s collection includes an extensive archive of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty transcripts and reports, along with a large collection of underground samizdat literature and materials from Central and Eastern Europe under communism. The archive also houses a growing collection of documents and audiovisual materials on international human rights and war crimes.
=== CEU Press ===
The CEU Press is the largest English-language publisher in Central and Eastern Europe. Since its founding in 1993, it has played an important role in publishing books on the economic, social, and political transformation of the region, including titles by Hungarians or on Hungarian themes. Four of its top-10 best-selling books worldwide are related to Hungary.

== International relations ==

<doc id="625967" wikidata="Q3191393" url="?curid=625967" title="KGB (video game)">
<text>KGB is a video game released for the Amiga and IBM PC compatibles in 1992. Set in the decadent final days of the Soviet Union, &quot;KGB&quot; is considered to be quite difficult, even for experienced gamers, since it relies on a real time clock and correct/wrong answers which can end the game immediately or after an event needed to be triggered; also, players may make errors which they will notice only hours later in-game. The game engine, graphics and interface have plenty of similarities with Cryo&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;.

&quot;KGB&quot; was also released on CD under the title Conspiracy, which included clips of Rukov&#x27;s father played by Donald Sutherland giving advice. In the CD version, all references to &quot;KGB&quot; within the game and manual were changed to &quot;Conspiracy&quot;.

== Plot ==
The game is set in the summer of 1991. The protagonist, Captain Maksim Mikahilovich Rukov, recently transferred to the Department P from the GRU after three years&#x27; duty, is ordered to investigate possible corruption inside the KGB after a former agent turned private eye was found murdered. Rukov finds himself investigating a party hardliner anti-perestroika plot that threatens the life of General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev.

=== Main characters ===
* Captain Maksim Mikhailovich Rukov was born on 12 January 1966 in Sverdlovsk. His parents, Mikhail Stepanovich Rukov and Svetlava Shailova, were killed on 23 May 1983 during an Afghan terrorist attack in Dushanbe (in the Tajik SSR) where his father was on active duty. Rukov learned English, Arabic and Spanish and joined the Spetsnaz as a paratrooper in 1988. The game begins as he makes his first steps in Department P.
* Uncle Vanya is the brother of Rukov&#x27;s father. He was also injured in the attack and uses a wheelchair, but is still able to take care of his nephew. He seems very suspicious of Maks&#x27;s new employers. (The name &quot;Uncle Vanya&quot; is a nod to the play of the same name by Anton Chekhov )
* Major Vovlov is Rukov&#x27;s direct superior at Department P. He is bad-tempered and authoritarian.
* Colonel Viktor Galushkin works at Department P. He personally knew Rukov&#x27;s father and went after his assassins.
* Major Radomir Savinkov, also a Department P member, is Rukov&#x27;s controller in Leningrad. He is highly intelligent.
* Colonel Vladimir Kusnetsov is the head of KGB&#x27;s Department 7 in Leningrad. He is very hostile to Department P.
* Captain Piotr Chapkin works at Department 7 with his father-in-law, Colonel Kusnetsov.
* Major Grigori Agabekov is second in command at Department 7. He served in Afghanistan. He has a clean record and good reputation.
* Nathaniel Greenberg and Carla Wallace are American CIA agents who happen to be working on the same case as Rukov.

==Reception==

&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; said in February 1993 that &quot;KGB&quot; &quot;was very much in the John le Carré mold, with lots of hidden intrigue, deep subterfuge and criss-crossing plot lines. One almost expects George Smiley to turn up&quot;. The magazine praised the game&#x27;s graphics and &quot;unusual feel&quot;, and concluded that it was &quot;an engrossing and atmospheric product with more depth and attention to detail than offered by most of the latest graphic adventures&quot;. In April 1994 the magazine said of the CD remake, &quot;Conspiracy&quot;, that although Donald Sutherland&#x27;s acting was &quot;first-rate&quot; the addition of his scenes to the original game was &quot;a bit strained&quot;, concluding that &quot;The novelty of seeing a Big Screen actor in an adventure game is about the only thing going for it&quot;.

<doc id="625969" wikidata="Q591604" url="?curid=625969" title="Warren Truss">
<text>Warren Errol Truss (born 8 October 1948) is a former Australian politician who served as the 16th deputy prime minister of Australia and the minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development in the Abbott government and the Turnbull government. Truss served as the federal leader of the National Party of Australia (The Nationals) between 2007 and 11 February 2016 when he announced his decision to retire and not contest the 2016 federal election. He was the member of the House of Representatives for Wide Bay from the 1990 election until his retirement in May 2016. Following the merger of the Queensland branches of the Nationals and Liberals, Truss was re-elected in 2010 for the Liberal National Party.

==Early life==
Truss was born in the region of Kingaroy, Queensland. He attended Concordia Lutheran College in Toowoomba. He was a bean farmer before he entered politics. He was chair of the Sugar Coast Burnett Regional Tourism Board and a councillor of the Shire of Kingaroy 1976–90. He was Chairman of Kingaroy Shire Council from 1983 to 1990.

==Political career==
Truss&#x27;s first attempt at a parliamentary seat was in the Queensland state parliament as the Nationals candidate at the 1988 Barambah by-election, triggered by the retirement of former premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen. However, Truss lost to an independent candidate Trevor Perrett, who later joined the National Party.

===Parliament===
Truss was elected to the safe National seat of Wide Bay at the 1990 election. He was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry 1994–96.

With the Liberal/National Coalition defeating the Australian Labor Party at the 1996 election, Truss was appointed Deputy Leader of the House 1997–98, Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs 1997–98, and Minister for Community Services 1998–99. He was promoted to the John Howard cabinet and served as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry 1999–2005.

===Nationals leadership===
In June 2005 John Anderson announced his intention to resign as National Party Leader. Deputy Leader Mark Vaile was elected the new Leader, and Truss was elected Deputy Leader. In the reshuffled ministry following Anderson&#x27;s resignation Truss became Minister for Transport and Regional Services.

In 2006, following the AWB oil for food scandal, Truss and Vaile swapped portfolios, with Truss becoming Minister for Trade and Vaile taking the Transport and Regional Services portfolio until the defeat of the Liberal/National Coalition government at the 2007 election.

After the election, Mark Vaile resigned as National Party Leader, citing the party&#x27;s need for &quot;generational renewal&quot;. With some reluctance, Truss nominated for the leadership, and was elected as federal leader of the Nationals on 3 December 2007.

In 2008, Coalition leader Malcolm Turnbull appointed Truss as Shadow Minister for Trade, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. He retained that portfolio after Tony Abbott became Coalition leader in late 2009. Following the 2010 election, Truss became Shadow Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. At this election, Truss was elected for the Liberal National Party, which had been formed from the 2009 merger of the two non-Labor parties&#x27; Queensland branches. However, he continued to sit as a National, and remained the Nationals&#x27; federal leader.

===Deputy Prime Minister===

Truss retained his seat in the 2013 Federal election, in which the Coalition was elected to a strong majority government. On 18 September, Truss was sworn in as Deputy Prime Minister, per a longstanding agreement between the Liberals and Nationals. The leader of the Nationals has ranked second in all but two non-Labor governments since the Coalition was first formed in 1923.

Truss remained Deputy Prime Minister after Turnbull deposed Abbott in a 2015 leadership spill. On 11 February 2016 Truss announced his decision to retire from politics at the 2016 federal election and immediately resigned as Nationals leader and Deputy Prime Minister. Barnaby Joyce was elected as leader and was sworn as the Deputy Prime Minister. Truss also resigned from cabinet and returned to the backbench.

Truss&#x27;s leadership of the Nationals was considered steady, albeit rarely visible. Despite being the number-two man in the government, Truss was relatively unknown; only one in five Australians were familiar with him. He lifted the party&#x27;s representation in the House of Representatives from ten seats in 2007 to 15 seats in 2013.

==Honours and awards==

On 1 January 2001, Truss was awarded the Centenary Medal for &quot;service as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry&quot;.

In 2014, the South Burnett Regional Council named their Kingaroy Chambers the &quot;Warren Truss Chamber&quot; in recognition of Truss&#x27;s time as Mayor of the former Kingaroy Shire.

Truss was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia in the 2019 Australia Day Honours for &quot;eminent service to the Parliament of Australia, particularly in the areas of trade, transport, agriculture, and rural and regional development&quot;.

Administratively, the Northern Sea Route begins at the boundary between the Barents and Kara Seas (the Kara Strait) and ends in the Bering Strait (Cape Dezhnev). The NSR straddles the seas of the Arctic Ocean (Kara, Laptev, East Siberian and Chukchi Seas).

The entire route lies in Arctic waters and within Russia&#x27;s exclusive economic zone (EEZ), and is included in what has been called the Northeast Passage, analogous to Canada&#x27;s Northwest Passage. The Northern Sea Route itself does not include the Barents Sea, and it therefore does not reach the Atlantic.

The Northern Sea Route currently serves the Arctic ports and major rivers of Siberia by importing fuel, equipment, food and exporting timber and minerals. Currently, six major seaports are located on the NSR route in the Arctic Zone of the Russian Federation: Sabetta, Dikson, Dudinka, Khatanga, Tiksi, and Pevek ports. Some parts of the route are only free of ice for two months per year, but melting Arctic ice caps are likely to increase traffic and the commercial viability of the Northern Sea Route. One study, for instance, projects &quot;remarkable shifts in trade flows between Asia and Europe, diversion of trade within Europe, heavy shipping traffic in the Arctic and a substantial drop in Suez traffic. Projected shifts in trade also imply substantial pressure on an already threatened Arctic ecosystem&quot;. At the same time, research conducted by the Center for Marine Research showed that exceeding the maximum permissible concentrations in the atmospheric air, sea waters, and bottom sediments, which could indicate the impact of economic activities at this stage of development of the NSR was not recorded.

Proponents of using the sea route for global trade claim that because it is considerably shorter than the existing sea routes from Asia to Europe, usage emits less , by cutting time at sea and fuel consumption by more than half. The distance from Murmansk (Russia) to Yokohama (Japan) through the Suez Canal is 12,840 nautical miles, but only 5,770 nautical miles through the Northern Sea Route. For the corporate players in bulk shipping of relatively low-value raw materials, cost savings for fuel are a crucial driver to explore the Northern Sea Route for commercial transits, more than delivery time, or environmental concerns. Sailing along the NSR can also help to reduce emission costs due to shorter distances. With the maritime industry joining the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) from 2024 and large freight companies receiving huge carbon bills, the savings on the EU ETS from reducing emissions could be in addition to the economic benefits for shippers.

==History==
===19th century===
The route was first conquered by Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld&#x27;s expedition with a single wintering in 1878–79.

===20th century===
The Northern Sea Route is one of several Arctic shipping routes. Since the mid-1930s the Northern Sea Route has been an officially managed and administered shipping route along Russia&#x27;s northern/Arctic coast. A convoy of seven brand new merchant vessels (900 DWT to 5,500 DWT) built for People&#x27;s Republic of China but under Polish flag from Gdynia with the assistance of Soviet icebreakers reached port of Pevek (via Kara Gates, Vilkitsky, Dmitry Laptev and Sannikov Straits), two days of navigation before Bering Strait in 1956. The administrative entity was sequentially updated, upgraded and renamed. Thus, in 2013, the Federal State Budgetary Institution “Administration of the Northern Sea Route” was created by Russia. In 2022 organizational authority  was transferred to the Main Directorate of the Northern Sea Route of Rosatom by Russia.

===21st century===
Since 2008, the structure of Rosatom includes the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker, designed to travel the NSR.

Beginning in the late 2010s, Russia began improving its defense resources near the Northern Sea Route.

Two-thirds of the Arctic seas remain ice-free in summer, which is why ships have more route options. In August 2017, the first ship traversed the Northern Sea Route without the use of icebreakers. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, this foreshadows more shipping through the Arctic, as the sea ice melts and makes shipping easier.

The Dutch Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis projected in 2015 that the Northern Sea Route may be ice-free by 2030, earlier than the Northwest Passage or Transpolar Sea Route. A 2016 report by the Copenhagen Business School found that large-scale trans-Arctic shipping may become economically viable by 2040. 

The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping maintains an &quot;ice class&quot;. The Rosneft corporation often contracts the Zvezda Shipyard to build its LNG carriers, for use with the output of the Trebs and Titov oil fields. The Yamal LNG project of Novatek is another industrial scale development which transports product via the NSR.

In July 2018 the Russian government transferred the main responsibility for the Northern Sea Route to Rosatom. Rosatom is a state corporation that manages the world&#x27;s only nuclear icebreakers. As of 2020 the fleet included seven vessels: &quot;Yamal&quot;, Project 10521 &quot;50 Let Pobedy&quot;, &quot;Taymyr&quot;, &quot;Vaygach&quot;, &quot;Arktika&quot;, &quot;Siberia&quot; and &quot;Ural&quot;, and as of press date the world&#x27;s only transport vessel with nuclear power plant: the &quot;Sevmorput&quot; (1988). The last three nuclear icebreakers are the latest of Project 22220. Rosatom also provides navigation and hydrographic support in the waters of the Northern Sea Route, develops the infrastructure of sea harbors, and manages the state property of these ports.

In August 2018 Maersk Line sent the new &quot;ice-class&quot; container ship &quot;Venta Maersk&quot; through the route to gather data on operational feasibility, though they did not currently see it as commercially attractive. Escort assistance was required for three days from the Russian nuclear-powered icebreaker .

In June 2019 Dubai-based DP World signed agreements with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, ROSATOM, and Norilsk Nickel aiming to develop the Northern Sea Route.

As the Northern Sea Route is a strategically important transport artery, it can already be called economically profitable in comparison, for example, with the Suez Canal due to a number of reasons:
* Fuel savings due to reduced distance;
* The shorter distance reduces the cost of staff labor and chartering vessels;
* The Northern Sea Route does not charge payments for the passage (unlike, for example, the Suez Canal);
* There are no queues (unlike, for example, the Suez Canal);
* There is no risk of a pirate attack.

As the development of the icebreaking fleet is the most important condition for constant navigation in Arctic waters, another three nuclear icebreakers of Project 22220 are currently being built in St. Petersburg: &quot;Yakutiya&quot;, &quot;Chukotka&quot; and &quot;Leningrad&quot; laid down in January 2024. All nuclear icebreakers of Project 22220 will be able to change the draft from 10.5 to 8.1 meters, depending on the depth, which will allow them to work both at sea and in the mouths of Siberian rivers.

Nuclear icebreakers of Project 22220 are powered by two RITM-200 reactors capable of overcoming ice up to 3 meters thick.

In addition, the Zvezda shipyard is working on the construction of the world&#x27;s most powerful nuclear icebreaker Project 10510 &quot;Russia&quot;, scheduled to commissioning in 2027. Two more icebreakers of this prototype are also planned to be built. These icebreakers will be equipped with a two-reactor power plant with RITM-400 reactors with a capacity of 315 MW. The maximum ice thickness overcome by these icebreakers will exceed 4 meters.

It was reported in 2023 that Rosmorport, a state-owned agency of the Russian Ministry of Transport, has plans to run cruises for tourists in icebreakers along the entire Northern Sea Route between Murmansk and Vladivostok.

It was reported in July 2024 that &quot;Sibir&quot; would escort the light ice-class vessel &quot;Xin Xin Hai 1&quot; on its voyage from the Port of Taicang near Shanghai via the Bering Strait and the NSR to the Port of Arkhangelsk before travelling on toward ports in the northern Europe. The New New Shipping Line of Hainan Yangpu, which owns at least two ice-class vessels, completed seven transits between July 2023 and December 2023, and in June 2024 signed an agreement with Rosatom to establish a year-round arctic shipping route.

==Rosatom and the Atomflot==
Rosatom is a state corporation that organizes the navigation of vessels in the waters of the NSR in accordance with the Merchant Shipping Code, manages a fleet of powerful nuclear icebreakers, ensures the safety and uninterrupted operation of navigation, provides port services for gas tankers in case of unfavorable weather conditions. Rosatom, a legacy member of the Arctic Economic Council, also provides navigation and hydrographic support in the waters of the Northern Sea Route, develops the infrastructure of sea harbors, and manages the state property of these ports. For this purpose, the Directorate of the Northern Sea Route was formed, which now manages three subordinate organizations &quot;Atomflot&quot; (ROSATOMFLOT), &quot;Hydrographic Enterprise&quot; and &quot;ChukotAtomEnergo&quot;.

==Glavsevmorput==
Recently, the &quot;Main Directorate of the Northern Sea Route&quot; (&quot;Glavsevmorput&quot;) was established on the basis of the Naval Operations Headquarters of FSUE “Atomflot”. The main purpose of the creation of Glavsevmorput is to organize the navigation of vessels in the waters of the Northern Sea Route. Glavsevmorput Federal State Budgetary Institution solves the following tasks: ensuring the organization of icebreaking vessels taking into account the hydrometeorological, ice, and navigation conditions in the waters of the NSR; vessels navigation in the waters of the NSR; issuance, suspension, renewal, and termination of permits for sailing vessels in the waters of the NSR. To solve these tasks, the department arranges icebreaker fleet vessels in the waters of the NSR, monitors the traffic in the NSR water area, provides information on hydrometeorological, ice, and navigation conditions, and processes information from vessels located in the NSR water area.

== Economic assessment ==
Researchers and economists usually compare the Northern Sea Route with the conventional Suez Canal Route or Southern Sea Route. The first route is shorter, which allows for saving on fuel, but it is connected with environmental risks and increased operating costs. However, the above-mentioned research can be considered disputable and incomplete, as it does not consider such factors like the reduced length of the Northern Sea Route (comparing to the Suez Canal) and, therefore, reduced CO2 emissions; the absence of charge payments for the passage; no risks of a pirate attack; the reduced cost of journey due to its reduced length.

Major shipping companies encounter substantial costs due to carbon emissions, whereas the deployment of nuclear icebreakers, which operate without hydrocarbon fuel and produce very low carbon emissions, offers an economic advantage for shippers.

Some studies recommend the joint usage of the two routes where the Northern Sea Route is used in summer when it is almost ice-free, and the Suez Canal Route is sailed in the rest of the year. The researchers also claim that the economic feasibility of the NSR largely depends on its weather conditions.

Even though the Arctic ice is melting and Polar routes are being extensively studied, the amount of cargo shipped through the Northern Sea Route (NSR) remains low in comparison to the Suez Canal. However, the cargo traffic steadily grows every year. The research shows that the NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme can be more competitive than the use of the Suez Canal Route only. If the shipping company provides sufficient loading on the NSR, uses a reliable ice-class vessel for navigation and the price of crude oil is high, the economic advantage of the NSR-SCR combined shipping scheme is obvious. Ice thickness directly affects the shipping cost. Now, when the Arctic ice is slowly melting due to weather conditions, the cost of icebreaking service is expected to reduce. Also, vessels of some ice classes can sail on the NSR independently. That is why the NSR icebreaker escort fee may be several times lower than the SCR toll.

State Corporation Rosatom assumes the possibility and functions of the NSR and ensures the safety of navigation on the high technological level. Besides organizing the navigation along the NSR and the icebreaking services with the world&#x27;s only nuclear icebreaker fleet, Rosatom is planning to implement the Arctic Ice Regime Shipping System (AIRSS) methodology. This system will represent a digital space that will provide various services to cargo carriers, shipowners, captains, insurers, and other participants in the logistics market on the NSR. In particular, it involves issuing permits for the passage of vessels, monitoring, dispatching, and managing the work of the fleet. The single digital platform will collect information from all the available sources, for example, hydrometeorological data, the location of ships and icebreakers, port congestion. As a result, users will receive an advanced &quot;ice navigator&quot; that will allow to plot a precise route in view of the changing ice conditions of the NSR. In other words, the study of Sibul et al. proposed a path-finding algorithm for the NSR strategic assessment. It uses real weather as input and find the optimal shipping route.

==Economic effects==
Number of complete through transits per flag state.
The total traffic volume on the Northern Sea Route in 2022 was 34.034 million tonnes, slightly less than in 2021. Total number of voyages in 2022 was 2994, made by 314 vessels. In the months from January to July, the number of voyages was higher than in 2021. 280 voyages was made with LNG from the Sabetta port.

The volume of cargo transported along the Northern Sea Route (NSR) in 2023 reached a historical maximum and amounted to 36.254 million tons.

In 2023, the record for transit traffic in the waters of the Northern Sea Route was also broken; more than 2.1 million tons of cargo were transported.

The growing importance of the NSR as an additional route and source of stability in the global logistics chain may increase significantly due to the fact that more and more of the world&#x27;s largest shipping companies are avoiding the Red Sea due to the situation with Houthi missile attacks 

==Environmental assessments==
According to the Fourth IMO GHG Study 2020, sea cargo transportation is responsible for 2.9% of global emissions. In the next 20 years the trading maritime volume is expected to double. Marine transport produces about 1 gigaton of carbon dioxide () emissions per year and has been struggling for many years to reduce its environmental impact. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has obliged sea carriers to reduce emissions by 50% by 2050.

Marine transport generates 14% of all transport emissions, and effective techniques that could replace marine engines powered by fossil fuels are not currently used, in the case of nuclear power, or still in modern era redevelopment, such as wind and solar power. Due to its shorter length, navigation on the NSR contributes to reducing the carbon footprint of maritime transport, although this entails considerable risks for fragile Arctic ecosystems.

Taking care of the environmental is in focus when it comes to the development of the Northern Sea Route.

For example, Rosatom evaluates the current state of the environment in NSR waters as a part of the joint project with Lomonosov Moscow State University Marine Research Centre (MSU MRC). The project involves studies that cover all components of the environment to determine the impact of maritime traffic at all ecosystem levels by means of experimental methods, special equipment, the development of digital services, and environmental practices.

One of the key priorities within project implementation is the ongoing interaction between the international expert community from international environmental research institutes and non-governmental organizations.

Over the course of three years, representatives of leading scientific institutions from Norway, Finland, France, Iceland, Great Britain, China, India, Egypt, Malaysia, Turkey took part in the project.

<text>These are lists of territorial governors by century and by year, such as the administrators of colonies, protectorates, or other dependencies. Where applicable, native rulers are also listed.

For the purposes of these lists, a current dependency is any entity listed on these lists of dependent territories and other entities. A dependent territory is normally a territory that does not possess full political independence or sovereignty as a sovereign state yet remains politically outside the controlling state&#x27;s integral area. This latter condition distinguishes a dependent territory from an autonomous region or administrative division, which forms an integral part of the parent state. The administrators of uninhabited territories are excluded.

<doc id="625998" wikidata="Q1214916" url="?curid=625998" title="The Music of Chance">
<text>The Music of Chance (1990) is an absurdist novel by Paul Auster. It was a 1991 finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction and was later made into a film in 1993; Mandy Patinkin played Nashe and James Spader played Pozzi.

==Plot summary==
Jim Nashe is a fireman with a two-year-old daughter and wife who has just left him. Knowing he cannot work and raise a child at the same time, he sends her to live with his sister. Six months of sporadic visits pass and Nashe realizes that his daughter, Juliet, has begun to forget him. Suddenly, the father that abandoned Nashe as a child dies, leaving his children a large amount of money. Nashe, knowing that Juliet will be happier with her aunt, pays off all of his debts, buys a Saab and pursues &quot;a life of freedom&quot; by spending a year driving back and forth across the country.

His fortune now squandered, Nashe picks up a hot-headed young gambler named Jack Pozzi. The two hatch a plan to fleece a couple of wealthy bachelors named Flower and Stone in a poker game. In addition to purchasing a mansion, the two eccentrics also bought ten thousand stones, from the ruins of a fifteenth-century Irish castle destroyed by Oliver Cromwell; Flower and Stone intend to use them to build a &quot;Wailing Wall&quot; in the meadow behind their mansion.

Flower and Stone are not the suckers Pozzi takes them for and the plan backfires. Having run out of money Nashe decides to risk everything on &quot;a single blind turn of a card&quot; and puts up his car as collateral against the pot. He loses and the two indenture themselves to Flower and Stone as a way to pay back their debt. They will build the wall for Flower and Stone, a meaningless wall that nobody will ever see. For the rest of the novel, Flower and Stone are conspicuously absent. Nashe shrugs this off as fifty days of exercise, but Pozzi views it as nothing less than a violation of human decency.

The two men are watched over by Calvin Murks, the millionaires&#x27; tough but amiable hired man. When Pozzi takes a swing at Murks for cracking a joke about being too smart to play cards, Murks begins wearing a gun. Pozzi sees this as proof that he is nothing but a slave.

Even after the two men have completed working off their debt, the millionaires add on the food and entertainment charges the men have accrued as a result of living at the estate. Pozzi, convinced there is no way out of the contract, escapes the meadow. Days later Nashe finds his young friend sprawled on the grass beaten into a coma. Murks claims innocence and tells Nashe he took Pozzi to a hospital. Two weeks later, Murks tells Nashe that Pozzi checked himself out of the hospital and vanished, but Nashe is convinced that his friend is dead.

Time passes, the wall grows as does Nashe&#x27;s obsession with taking revenge on Murks. When Nashe has completed enough work on the wall to pay off his debt, Murks and his son-in-law Floyd take Nashe out to celebrate. Nashe beats Floyd in a game of pool, but refuses the fifty dollars he has won; Floyd accepts this, saying that he owes Nashe a favor. Soon after, the three men pile into Murks&#x27;s new car (Nashe&#x27;s old Saab) with the slightly more sober Nashe behind the wheel. Nashe promptly takes the car up to eighty-five miles an hour and deliberately collides, head-on into an oncoming vehicle.

==Influence==
&quot;The Music of Chance&quot; was referred to in David Mitchell&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Ghostwritten&quot;, which also deals with the nature of random chance. In the novel, one character is a member of a musical collective called The Music of Chance, named &quot;after a novel by that New York bloke&quot;.

Dialogue from the film adaptation is used in a track by Sweet Billy Pilgrim called &#x27;Here It Begins&#x27;.

== Adaptations ==
In 2009, Audible.com produced an audio version of &quot;The Music of Chance&quot;, narrated by Marc Vietor, as part of its &quot;Modern Vanguard&quot; line of audiobooks.

<doc id="626009" wikidata="Q5180819" url="?curid=626009" title="Craig Chandler">
<text>Craig B. Chandler is a Canadian businessman, lobbyist, and political activist. He is co-founder and CEO of the Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB). He was a candidate at the federal 2003 Progressive Conservative leadership convention, a candidate for Member of Parliament in Ontario, candidate for Member of the Legislative Assembly in Alberta, and candidate for Ward 12 City Councillor in Calgary, Alberta.

Craig Chandler is also the recipient of the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal in recognition of his extensive efforts in raising funds for the Veterans Food Bank.

==Political career==
===Early political experience===
As an undergraduate at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario in the late 1980s, Chandler joined the Reform Party of Canada, where he was active as an organizer and fund-raiser. In the 1993 federal election, Chandler ran as a Reform Party candidate in the riding of Hamilton Mountain, at the age of 23 finishing in second place with 10,297 votes, behind Liberal incumbent Beth Phinney, who received 27,218.

Chandler moved to Alberta in 1995. He ran in the 1997 provincial election as a candidate for the Social Credit Party of Alberta in the riding of Calgary West, finishing with 1,100 votes, or 7.5% of the electorate.

In 2000, Chandler&#x27;s Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB) supported the creation of the Canadian Alliance. In 2002, Chandler and the PGIB backed Stephen Harper&#x27;s successful bid for the leadership of the Alliance.

===Federal politics===
In 2003, Chandler joined the Progressive Conservative Party and became a candidate for the party&#x27;s leadership, running on a platform of creating a coalition between the PC and Alliance party caucuses. He withdrew prior to voting and endorsed Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice, who also supported cooperation between the parties.

At the end of his speech Chandler was complimentary of the leadership qualities of his competitors David Orchard and Scott Brison, before endorsing and pledging support to Calgary lawyer Jim Prentice&#x27;s leadership bid to the astonishment of many delegates in attendance.

Chandler admitted in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; and the &quot;National Post&quot; (May 29, 2003) that he had never tried to seriously contest the leadership of the PC Party, but had instead served as a voice for the Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB) and their United Alternative efforts. PGIB donated $250,000 to Chandler&#x27;s bid.

===Alberta provincial politics===

In the fall of 2007, Chandler sought the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta (PCAA) nomination of Calgary-Egmont for the up-coming Alberta provincial election. Soon after winning the contest with a massive majority, Premier Stelmach and the PCAA Executive reviewed Chandler&#x27;s candidacy. The concern was Chandler&#x27;s association with a Christian organization with traditional views on marriage at the time this debate was occurring. Premier Ed Stelmach rejected Chandler as a candidate for the PC Party of Alberta.

In the 2008 Alberta election held on March 3, Chandler ran as an independent candidate in the Calgary-Egmont riding against Jonathan Denis, his replacement as the Tory candidate, and Liberal Cathie Williams. Chandler was widely expected to run as a candidate for the new Wildrose Alliance Party of Alberta but was defeated in his attempt to win election to the new party&#x27;s board of directors. In the provincial election Chandler finished in third place with 2008 votes (16.2%), well behind Cathie Williams, the Liberal Party candidate, with 3289 votes (26.5%). The Progressive Conservative candidate (Jonathan Denis) won with 43.6% of the vote (5415 votes).&quot;
===Campaign management===
Chandler claims to have managed 48 campaigns, presumably nominations, leadership races, municipal, provincial and federal elections. He has never won any elections himself.

In November 2004 during the 2004 Alberta election, Craig Chandler managed the campaign of David Crutcher, an Alberta Alliance Party candidate in Calgary-Egmont. Crutcher was not elected, winning 1,657 votes, or 14% of the total. Notably, David Crutcher received more votes than any other Alliance candidate in an urban riding. In 2005, David Crutcher ran for the leadership of the Alberta Alliance and Chandler managed his leadership campaign. Crutcher placed third out of four candidates. Chandler also managed the successful campaign of MLA Art Johnston.

He was also the campaign manager for Calgary Ward 14 winning alderman Peter Demong, and briefly served as his constituency assistant. Chandler also managed the third-place race of Jon Lord for the Conservative Party nomination in Calgary Centre and produced victories for Councilor Shane Keating, Peter Demong and Joe Magliocca in the 2013 Calgary civic election.

In 2020, Chandler worked on Dr. Leslyn Lewis&#x27; campaign for leader of the Conservative Party of Canada in which she was defeated. According to Chandler&#x27;s website he claimed to be the Western Chair for her campaign. However, Steve Outhouse, the National Campaign Manager of Lewis&#x27;s campaign denied that Chandler was Western Chair. According to the Western Standard Outhouse stated &quot;he [Chandler] only ran the call centre for Alberta and Saskatchewan and set up a couple meet and greets for her. And that was it.&quot;

In 2021, Chandler spearheaded the Take Back City Hall initiative to elect more small-c conservatives at the municipal level in Calgary, Alberta. The initiative recruited candidates and managed their campaigns in a few wards in Calgary with the Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB) as a vehicle. Almost all of the races ended in a loss for the Chandler backed candidates with Chandler, who ran himself in Ward 12, soundly defeated. Only a single candidate Dan McLean in Ward 13 achieved victory.

In 2022 Chandler again was employed by Dr. Leslyn Lewis to work on her second leadership campaign to be the leader of the Conservative Party of Canada. However, in this second effort the results were lower than the first attempt where she garnered less than 10% of the vote losing to Pierre Poilievre on the first ballot.

=== In the media ===
Told Albertans to Vote Conservative or Leave

In 2007 Chandler was on record stating that new Albertans had to vote for conservative parties, or they had to leave Alberta. There was pushback from the PCAA that Chandler was dictating how people were to vote in an election and that only those votes that agreed with Chandler&#x27;s views were acceptable.

Ann Coulter Speaking Tour

In 2010 Ezra Levant, CEO of Rebel News, organized a cross country speaking tour at various universities by American right wing pundit Ann Coulter. Chandler attempted to pose as one of the organizers and as a result was banned from the events. According to Levant &quot;Chandler was not allowed to attend the reception because he misrepresented himself as an organizer in media interviews during the incident in Ottawa.&quot; Coulter herself spoke on the matter about Chandler&#x27;s misrepresentation saying “I was watching the local news, which was all hockey and Ann Coulter, and some nut came on claiming that he was the organizer behind my speech. [murmurs in background] OK, his name is Craig Chandler. I sent an e-mail to my bodyguard saying Craig Chandler is disinvited from the event in Calgary. He’s on TV claiming to be the organizer and denouncing me!” 

Racist Videos

In 2022, Chandler was featured in an online video deemed racist along with former Alberta Cabinet Minister Jonathan Denis. The video clips showed him using offensive stereotypes of first nations. In an interview Chandler stated he was pictured in one of the videos and that &quot;Some comedy is not politically correct, but this is a private function of my close friends. The video was taken by a close friend, I thought,&quot; he said. Chandler was working on Danielle Smith&#x27;s leadership campaign when the videos came out and she fired Chandler over it.

Later Chandler changed his story claiming the videos were fake. However, Hany Farid, an acknowledged expert in the area of deep fakes states &quot;But the knowledge of how these things are made, how difficult it would be to make them, I think it&#x27;s extremely unlikely that these are deepfakes.&quot;

=== Social Media ===
Chandler has a long history of controversial social media posts.

Threatening to sue Steve Outhouse

On March 22 Chandler posted to his two Facebook pages, LinkedIn account and Twitter account his dissatisfaction with UCP Campaign Chair Steve Outhouse. He later took down three of the posts but left his Twitter post in place. Chandler professed dissatisfaction with Outhouse being named campaign chair while being from Ontario among other complaints.
