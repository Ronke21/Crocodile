<text>Leichhardt () is a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Leichhardt is located 5 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district (CBD) and is the administrative centre for the local government area (LGA) of the Inner West Council. The suburb is bordered by Haberfield to the west, Annandale to the east, Lilyfield to the north and Petersham, Lewisham and Stanmore to the south.

==History==

===Aboriginal anthropology===
Leichhardt was once an area broadly inhabited by the Wangal band of the Dharug (Eora) language group. The &#x27;Eora people&#x27; was the name given to coastal Aboriginal people around Sydney – Eora means &quot;from this place&quot; – local Aboriginal people used this word to describe to Europeans where they came from, and in time the term became used to define Aboriginal people themselves. Wangal country was known as &#x27;wanne&#x27; and it originally extended from the suburbs of Balmain and Birchgrove in the east to Silverwater and Auburn in the west. It is unclear how many people were in the tribe; some research indicates in the broader Sydney region there were between 8000 – 10000 indigenous people, but migration over the seasons and violence between tribes would alter this number at different periods.
The northern boundary was the Parramatta River. Neighbouring Darug bands were the Cadigal to the east, the Wallumattagal on the northern shore of the Parramatta River and the Bediagal to the south.

===European settlement===

Leichhardt is named after the Prussian explorer Ludwig Leichhardt, who in the 1840s was feted for his 4,800 km (c. 3000 mi) expedition in search of an overland route from southern Queensland to Port Essington, a British settlement on the far northern coast of Australia (some 300 km to the north of the modern city of Darwin). In 1848, he famously vanished without trace on his attempt to cross the continent from the Darling Downs in Queensland to the Swan River Colony on the Western Australia coast.

Leichhardt was proclaimed a municipality in 1871. In 1949, it was merged with the municipalities of Annandale and Balmain. In 1967, the municipal boundary was altered to include Glebe and parts of Camperdown. In 2003, the municipal boundary was again changed, to exclude Glebe and Forest Lodge, which are now part of the City of Sydney.

==Commercial area==
The main commercial area in Leichhardt is located on Norton Street, north of Parramatta Road (Great Western Highway) and parallel to Balmain Road. The Norton Street commercial area contains a mix of residential buildings, restaurants (Italian and others), cafés, eateries and individual retail outlets, including several bookstores and grocery shops. There are also hotels, a Palace Cinema and two of the suburb&#x27;s two shopping centres – MarketPlace Leichhardt and Norton Plaza. Commercial developments are also found along the length of Parramatta Road.

The Italian Forum, located just off Norton Street, is notable for its design which seeks to emulate the feel of a Mediterranean town piazza. A pedestrian-only central courtyard featuring outdoors and indoors restaurant dining as well as Leichhardt Library is surrounded by small shops and boutiques on the level above, and all overlooked by residential apartments. Norton Street plays host to various events throughout the year, notably the Italian Fiesta in October, which showcases the Italian culture of the area.

The second shopping centre, MarketPlace Leichhardt (formerly Market Town), is located towards Haberfield on the corner of Marion and Flood Streets. MarketPlace Leichhardt has free car parking and is home to Woolworths, Aldi, Target and over 60 specialty stores.

Leichhardt was served by trams from Sydney&#x27;s former network from 1887 to the 1950s. The Annandale Line ran down Norton Street. The current bus depot at the top of William Street was a 12 road depot, designed to serve a number of planned lines that were never built. Instead, it was used to stored surplus trams in the off peak period, and was rebuilt as the Government Bus Workshops in 1937. A small spur of track remained and was later used by tour trams going through the depot yard nearest Pioneer Park.

==Culture==

Leichhardt is home to many creative industry workers and is known for its colourful and inventive mural art, such as the panorama at the Renwick Lane and at the Hawthorne Canal Railway Underpass. Leichhardt has access to many art and cultural organisations. Commercial galleries are found throughout the area and Boomali Gallery, the Aboriginal Arts Organisation is situated in Flood Street in Leichhardt.

The Italian community has a wealth of social and cultural organisations located in Leichhardt, and work is underway everyday to develop the Italian Forum Cultural Centre. Co.As.It. is one of them and they provide a range of culturally and linguistically appropriate services to enhance the quality of life of the community and to promote the Italian language and culture in New South Wales. The suburb was originally considered to be Sydney&#x27;s &#x27;little Italy&#x27;, but that reputation has since decreased.

Leichhardt is the yearly host of the Italian Festa on Norton Street where local traffic is temporarily closed on Norton and neighbouring streets transforming surroundings into a huge European style outdoor café, celebrating Leichhardt&#x27;s cultural diversity with an International Food Fair, gift stalls, community expos and live entertainment throughout the day. Leichhardt is also known for its café culture with cafés in abundance. The oldest café in the area is Café Sport, which is located on Norton Street.

* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 1.3% of the population. 
* 67.6% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 5.0%, Italy 2.4%, New Zealand 2.4%, China 1.4% and Ireland 1.0%.

33.6% of occupied dwellings were terraces, semis or townhouses, 36.5% were separate density housing houses and 29.0% were apartments. The average age of people in the suburb was similar to the rest of Sydney (37) and a lower percentage of people owned their homes outright (23.8%) than those paying them off (34.1%) or renting (40.4%). Median loan repayments ($3,400 per month) were much higher than the national figure ($1,863).

Since the middle of the 20th century, Leichhardt has been a centre for the Italian community, reflected in the many Italian-owned businesses in the area. Although it has become less distinctively Italian with the increasing gentrification of the suburb and movement of families to suburbs with larger blocks of land, its Italian character is still palpable, particularly in the popular restaurants and cafés of its main street, Norton Street. Many residents moved to suburbs further away from Sydney as the city has expanded and larger housing blocks became available.

Grant Rd was the first Terminus of the BB&amp;CI railway, when it began services from Bombay. The BB&amp;CI&#x27;s first train from Bombay to Ahmedabad, which first ran on 28 November 1864, too terminated at Grant Rd. The train would leave Grant Rd at 7:00 a.m. and would reach Ahmedabad at 5:30 p.m. the following day. On 1 November 1865, a Suburban service was started between Grant Rd and Bassein Rd (today&#x27;s Vasai Road railway Station) . It was also a station on the first regular suburban service (started on 12 April 1867), though by then the terminus had been changed to the new Bombay Backbay Station. 

The station, in later times became a goods shed, and carriages and wagons were also stabled there.

<text>Churney Road, (station code: CYR) is a railway station on the Western Line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway. It serves the suburb of Charni Road. The next station south is Marine Lines Station; the next station north is Grant Road Station. Southbound fast locals stop at Charni Road but skip the station during the evening peak hours (17:00 to 20:00). The main significance of Charni Road station is that it is near the Girgaum Chowpatty beach and Marine Drive promenade, a major destination for tourists in Mumbai. It is also important because of the diamond trading industry located here, mainly in the Panchratna and Prasad chambers building near the railway station.

== History ==
The word &#x27;Charni&#x27; is derived from the Marathi word &quot;&#x27;Charne&quot;&#x27; (t&quot;o graze&quot;), as the area was once used as a grazing ground for cattle and horses. In 1838, the British rulers introduced a &#x27;grazing fee&#x27; which several cattle-owners could not afford. Therefore, Sir Jamshetji Jeejeebhoy spent 20,000 from his own purse for purchasing some grasslands near the seafront at Thakurdwar and saw that the starving cattle grazed without a fee in that area. In time the area became known as &quot;Charni&quot; meaning grazing. When a railway station on the BB&amp;CI railway was constructed there it was called Charni Road. The station was opened on 3rd September 1868. The BB&amp;CI suburban line from Back Bay to Virar opened in 1867.

==Surroundings==
Today Charni road is well known for its old charm Chawls, wholesale markets of diamonds (Opera House), garments, Irani cafés traditional Maharashtrian culture (Girgaon) and also tall skyscrapers. It is not only famous for skyscrapers and Chowpatty but also attracts crowds because of the religious places built in it (Mumbadevi temple) and also the famous celebration of Gudipadva and Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Girgaon. Also the famous Hinduja College of commerce and economics have been set up by Hinduja group in 1974.

For information about the area, see Charni Road.

<doc id="626631" wikidata="Q258778" url="?curid=626631" title="Extensible Application Markup Language">
<text>Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML ) is a declarative XML-based language developed by Microsoft for initializing structured values and objects. It is available under Microsoft&#x27;s Open Specification Promise. 

XAML is used extensively in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Silverlight, Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows UI Library (WinUI), Universal Windows Platform (UWP), and .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI). In WPF and UWP, XAML is a user interface markup language to define UI elements, data binding, and events. In WF, however, XAML defines workflows.

XAML elements map directly to Common Language Runtime (CLR) object instances, while XAML attributes map to CLR properties and events on those objects.

Anything that is created or implemented in XAML can be expressed using a more traditional .NET language, such as C# or Visual Basic .NET. However, a key aspect of the technology is the reduced complexity needed for tools to process XAML, because it is based on XML.

==Technology==
XAML originally stood for Extensible Avalon Markup Language, &quot;Avalon&quot; being the code-name for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Before the end of .NET Framework 3.0 development, however, Microsoft adopted XAML for Workflow Foundation (WF).

In WPF, XAML describes visual user interfaces. WPF allows for the definition of both 2D and 3D objects, rotations, animations, and a variety of other effects and features. A XAML file can be compiled into a Binary Application Markup Language (BAML) file, which may be inserted as a resource into a .NET Framework assembly. At run-time, the framework engine extracts the BAML file from assembly resources, parses it, and creates a corresponding WPF visual tree or workflow. 

In WF contexts, XAML describes potentially long-running declarative logic, such as those created by process modeling tools and rules systems. The serialization format for workflows was previously called XOML, to differentiate it from UI markup use of XAML, but now they are no longer distinguished. However, the file extension for files containing the workflow markup is still &quot;.xoml&quot;.

XAML uses a specific way to define look and feel called &quot;Template&quot;s; differing from Cascading Style Sheet syntax, it is closer to XBL.

To create XAML files, one could use Microsoft Expression Blend, Microsoft Visual Studio, the hostable WF visual designer, or XAMLPad.

==Examples==

This Windows Presentation Foundation example shows the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; in the top-level XAML container called Canvas.
&lt;Canvas xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2010&quot;
 xmlns:x=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml&quot;&gt;
 &lt;TextBlock&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
The schema (the part) may have to be changed to work on your computer.
Using a schema that Microsoft recommends, the example can also be
&lt;Canvas xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation&quot;&gt;
 &lt;TextBlock&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/TextBlock&gt;
&lt;/Canvas&gt;
A crucial part of utilizing XAML to its full potential is making appropriate usage of binding, as well as being comfortable with creating your own custom user elements as required, for your specific needs. Binding can be done as follows:
&lt;TextBox x:Name=&quot;txtInput&quot; /&gt;
&lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;{Binding ElementName=txtInput,Path=Text}&quot; /&gt;
==Differences between versions of XAML==
There are three main Microsoft implementations of XAML:
* Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), first available with .NET Framework 3.0
* Silverlight 3 and 4, first available for Internet Explorer 6 and now deprecated
* Windows UI Library (formerly UWP XAML and WinRT XAML), first shipped with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, but now available as a part of the Windows App SDK

These versions have some differences in the parsing behavior. Additionally, the Silverlight 4 XAML parser is not 100% backward-compatible with Silverlight 3 files. Silverlight 3 XAML files may be rejected or parsed differently by the Silverlight 4 parser.

== XAML Applications in Web Browsers ==
Historically, XAML based applications could be run in some web browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. This could be achieved through XBAP files created from WPF applications, or via the Silverlight browser plugin. However, both these methods are now unsupported on all major browsers due to their reliance on the discontinued NPAPI browser plugin interface.

==Lock-in Concerns==
In 2007, European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS) – a coalition of mostly American software companies – accused Microsoft of attempting to hijack HTML and replace it with XAML, thus creating a vendor lock-in. Jeremy Reimer, writing for &quot;Ars Technica&quot; described this comment as &quot;the most egregious error&quot; and added that XAML is unlikely to ever replace HTML.

<text>Marine Lines is a locality in South Mumbai. The name &quot;Marine Lines&quot; is derived from the Marine Battalion Lines, a military establishment built by the British in the 19th century. The battalion was later converted to an air force residential quarters, and now lies just south of Metro Adlabs. It is also the name of a railway station on the Mumbai suburban railway on the Western Railway railway line. Marine Lines was also the name of the road on which Bombay Hospital and Liberty Cinema stand. It is now known as V Thackersey Marg. Marine Drive is the famous promenade near the station. Marine Drive has one of the finest Art Deco Residential Buildings facing the sea. Built in 1951, it is India&#x27;s oldest aquarium and is named after Parsi entrepreneur DB Taraporewala, who provided funds for its development. Marine Drive is one of the greatest sites to see the monsoon in Mumbai if you&#x27;re travelling during the rainy season.

Near the station there is a Muslim cemetery and a municipal crematorium; Chandanwadi. Adjoining the station is the famous Marine Drive flyover; the only link to Marine Drive over the tracks from Princess Street beginning to end. Marine Drive/Marine lines is also known as the Queen&#x27;s Necklace because the street lights resemble a string of pearls in a necklace when viewed at night from an elevation location anywhere along the drive. Signage makes UNESCO tag visible at Marine Drive

&quot;New Marine Lines&quot; is the area just south of the station near Churchgate. It is home to a number of offices including the UTI, R.O.C. (Registrar of Companies), Customs (Marine and Preventive Wing), Income Tax office and various other Governmental agencies.

<text>Mad Mad House is a 2004 reality television series about a group of ten contestants competing for $100,000. The contestants live together in a house inhabited by another group of people known as the &quot;alts&quot; (for their alternative lifestyles). The alts voted the contestants off by judging them on their ability to perform &quot;trials&quot; which were based loosely on the practices of each alt&#x27;s lifestyle, and their behavior and attitude with the other guests. The show aired on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States and on Space in Canada. Reruns have also been aired on Fox Reality Channel.

==Critical response==
David Bianculli of the &quot;Daily News&quot; called &quot;Mad Mad House&quot; a &quot;bad bad show&quot; (a &quot;bon mot&quot; that other reviewers would also make). Comparing the series to previous ones produced by Smith and Weed, including &quot;Paradise Hotel&quot; and &quot;Forever Eden&quot;, Bianculli pronounced &quot;Mad Mad House&quot; to be &quot;their worst work yet&quot;. He mocked the contestants and berated the alts as &quot;losers&quot;. Virginia Heffernan of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the series &quot;unsettling&quot; and &quot;ghoulish&quot; but wondered if it might lead middle America to examine the casualness of their religious beliefs. The premiere episode drew a rating of 1.57 million viewers.

In February 2004, the National African Religion Congress sued the producers of &quot;Mad Mad House&quot; saying that it falsely represented Ta&#x27;Shia Asanti as a voodoo priestess. The group claimed that her dress identified her as a priestess of Yemoja of the Ifá tradition of the Yoruba people. The suit sought a court order requiring that the program not identify Asanti as a voodoo priestess. The group dropped the suit two months later after the network agreed to add a disclaimer to its website.

<doc id="626634" wikidata="Q540894" url="?curid=626634" title="Juliette (novel)">
<text>Juliette, or Vice Amply Rewarded (French: L&#x27;Histoire de Juliette ou les Prospérités du vice) is a novel written by the Marquis de Sade and published 1797–1801, accompanying de Sade&#x27;s 1797 version of his novel &quot;Justine&quot;. While Justine, Juliette&#x27;s sister, was a virtuous woman who consequently encountered nothing but despair and abuse, Juliette is an amoral nymphomaniac murderer who is successful and happy. As many other of his works, &quot;Juliette&quot; follows a pattern of violently pornographic scenes followed by long treatises on a broad range of philosophical topics, including theology, morality, aesthetics, naturalism and also Sade&#x27;s dark, fatalistic view of world metaphysics.

==Plot summary==
The majority of the novel is a first-person narrative in which the amoral Juliette recounts to her moral sister Justine, among other people, the events of her life. Juliette is raised in a convent. However, at age thirteen she is seduced by a woman who immediately explains that morality, religion and other such concepts are meaningless. There are plenty of similar philosophical musings during the book, all attacking the ideas of God, morals, remorse, love, etc., the overall conclusion being that the only aim in life is &quot;to enjoy oneself at no matter whose expense.&quot; Juliette takes this to the extreme and manages to murder her way through numerous people, including various family members and friends.

During Juliette&#x27;s life from age 13 to about 30, the wanton anti-heroine engages in virtually every form of depravity and encounters a series of like-minded libertines. She befriends the ferocious Clairwil, whose main passion is the murder of boys and young men, as revenge for the general 
brutality of men toward women. She meets Saint Fond, a 50-year-old multi-millionaire who murders his father, commits incest with his daughter, tortures young girls to death on a daily basis, and even plots an ambitious scheme to provoke a famine that will wipe out half the population of France. She also becomes acquainted with Minski, a gigantic ogre-like Muscovite who delights in raping and torturing young boys and girls to death before eating them. The novel also contains several scenes of &quot;fetishism, exhibitionism, voyeurism, sexual masochism, sexual sadism, paedophilia, zoophilia, and necrophilia&quot;, as well as horrific sexual violence.

===Real people in &quot;Juliette&quot;===
During her tour of Europe, Juliette encounters a series of libertines, including several historical figures who are all portrayed as depraved. A long audience with Pope Pius VI is one of the more extensive scenes in &quot;Juliette&quot;. The heroine repeatedly addresses the Pope by his legal name, &quot;Braschi&quot;. She also flaunts her learning with a verbal, yet highly detailed, catalogue of alleged immoralities committed by his papal predecessors. Their conversation ends (like nearly every scene in the narrative) with an orgy, in which Pope Pius is portrayed as a secret libertine. While discussing murder, Braschi notes that cruelty is essential to pleasure, remarking that &quot;killing is not enough, one must kill in hideous style&quot;.

Soon after this, the male character Brisatesta narrates two scandalous encounters. The first is with &quot;Princess Sophia, niece of the King of Prussia&quot;, who has just married &quot;the Stadtholder&quot; at the Hague. This is a presumed reference to Wilhelmina of Prussia, Princess of Orange, who married the last Dutch Stadtholder, William V of Orange, in 1767, and was still alive when &quot;Juliette&quot; was published thirty years later. The second encounter is with Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia.

==Publication and reception==
Both &quot;Justine&quot; and &quot;Juliette&quot; were published anonymously. Napoleon ordered the arrest of the author, and as a result de Sade was incarcerated without trial for the last thirteen years of his life.

The essay (&quot;Excursus II&quot;) &quot;Juliette or Enlightenment and Morality&quot; in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno&#x27;s &quot;Dialectic of Enlightenment&quot; (1947) analyses Juliette as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. They write: &quot;she demonises Catholicism as the most-up-to-date mythology—and along with it, civilisation as a whole. Her comportment is enlightened and efficient as she goes about her work of sacrilege … She favours system and consequence.&quot;

== History ==

During the eighteenth and up to the mid-19th century, Mumbai was a walled city surrounded by a fortification. The city walls had three gates. One of the gates, Churchgate, was named after St. Thomas Cathedral, Mumbai. The area west of the original gate came to be known as Churchgate. In the mid-19th century, the wall of the fort along with its gates were torn down to aid in the expansion of the city. At the exact location of the Churchgate, Flora Fountain was built.

<text>Cotton Green is a suburb of Mumbai, and a noted residential and commercial area east of Parel, in central Mumbai, 8 km north of Colaba. It is also the name of a railway station on the Mumbai suburban railway, which lies along the Harbour line, which is a part of the Central Railway.

There was an earlier Cotton Green in Colaba that is marked in old maps. That location is now part of Badhwar Park. Cotton was shipped from this location as recently as 1910.

==Etymology==
The station is named Cotton Green after an Art Deco building of the &quot;Cotton Exchange&quot; and a series of warehouses. The older Cotton Green in Colaba was thus named because it was in a village green and housed the original cotton exchange.

One more possibility is as follows. The station is named Cotton Green after an Art Deco building of the &quot;Cotton Exchange&quot; and a series of warehouses. The older Cotton Green in Colaba was thus named because it was in a village green and housed the original cotton exchange. In the 18th century the area around the only English church (Today&#x27;s St. Thomas Church at Fort, Bombay (Mumbai)) was situated on what is called as the Green, a spacious area that continued from the Fort thereto, and was pleasantly laid out in walks planted with trees. The area was naturally called ‘Bombay Green’. Due to the area&#x27;s proximity to the docks and the piled bales of Cotton for trade thereat, it came to be referred as ‘Cotton Green’. In 1844, cotton trade was shifted from this area to further south at Colaba. The new locality came to be called rather predictably as ‘New Cotton Green’. Subsequently, due to further remodeling and reclamation, the cotton trade at ‘New Cotton Green’ was shifted to ‘Sewri-Mazgaon’ reclamation area, where a spacious Cotton Exchange Building was also built. The Rail Station opposite this Cotton Exchange Building was for obvious reasons named &quot;Cotton Green&quot;.

== History ==

The Cotton Exchange Building was built in 1924 and used for trading in Cotton until 1945. The building originally was in a minty green colour, today it stands tall in beige and brown around the edges and has been fully restored to its former glory. The building is a stunning example of engineering and has not needed any maintenance except replacement of glass windows which are shattered by cricket balls as children play cricket on roads around the building.

==Overview==
The railway station caters to the area called Kalachowki, Ferbandar and Ghodapdeo. Kalachowki is a big residential area consisting of a colony called Abhyudaya Nagar which has 43 MHADA-built (Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority) housing, intended those who worked in the textile mills in the area.

The colony has now turned into prime residential and commercial property, and is no longer owned by MHADA. Because of its proximity to Mumbai&#x27;s prime central areas such as Dadar (15-minute drive) and Parel, Lower Parel and Worli (20–25 minutes&#x27; drive)

Kalachowki also has another big colony called Labour Docks, which also belonged to MHADA.

This area saw the development of numerous high-rise apartments (going up to 30 floors).

<text>Prabhadevi railway station, formerly Elphinstone Road railway station, is a railway station junction which connects the Central line to of Mumbai Suburban Railway. It serves the area of Prabhadevi in Mumbai, India. This railway station has two platforms which are of only slow trains halt.

==Passengers==
Prabhadevi railway stations are a set of one of the busiest stations on the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. Over 15.6 million passenger&#x27;s journey originates from either of these stations, earning yearly, due to offices being situated around these railway stations.

==History==
The railway station on the Prabhadevi side was inaugurated in 1867 which was named Elphinstone Road railway station (with station code EPR) after John, 13th Lord Elphinstone, the Governor of Bombay from 1853 to 1860.

After Independence, there were demands from the local people for the railway station to be renamed to Prabhadevi. This renaming, from the 18th-century Prabhadevi Temple of Hindu goddess Prabhavati Devi located near the station, was first proposed by Shiv Sena leader Diwakar Raote in 1991.

The Maharashtra Legislature passed a resolution to that effect on 16 December 2016, followed by the Maharashtra Government sending a proposal for renaming the station to the Union Home Ministry which was approved on 6 May 2017.

After the approval, the name of Elphinstone Road railway station was officially changed to Prabhadevi railway station on 19 July 2018. with its new station code as PBHD with the approval of Indian Railways

==Foot-over-bridges==
Due to the super-dense crush load on this station, two foot overbridges are constructed between the southern part of the Parel side and the northern part of the Prabhadevi side for easier interchanging between these platforms. Both of them were constructed in 2018.

Before that, there was only one foot overbridge that was narrower in width and older than 50 years, This created problems for commuters during peak hours. Due to this, commuters used to cross the tracks on to the adjoining platform 3 and use the FOB of that platform. This prompted the Railways to put up a fence between the platforms in order to stop commuters from crossing the tracks. This has increased the pressure on the overbridge even more and hence forced the Railways into assigning the Railway Protection Force and Home Guard to help commuters cross the bridge and prevent any stampedes and also help to approach trains.

For that purpose, the first foot overbridge was reconstructed by the joint operation of the Corps of Engineers of the Indian Army and Indian Railways and opened on 27 February 2018, within the time span of 117 days. Whereas the second foot overbridge was newly constructed to reduce the load on the first foot overbridge and make a second interchange on this station, Opened for the public on 18 June 2018.

===Stampede===

On 29 September 2017 during the morning rush-hour, a stampede occurred at the western side of foot overbridge on the Parel–Prabhadevi railway station. 23 people were killed, 19 injured and 39 suffered other injuries. The incident was classified as a case of an accident by the Mumbai Police.

<doc id="626644" wikidata="Q3635765" url="?curid=626644" title="Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, Bandra">
<text>Officially, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, colloquially known as Mount Bandra and Mount St Mary Church; is a basilica (shrine) of the Roman Catholic Church, located at the Bandra neighbourhood of Bombay (Mumbai), India.

The festival of the nativity of St Mary, also known as Holy Marymas or the Bandra Fest, is celebrated here on the 8th day of September: The auspicious occasion of the birth of the virgin-mother of Jesus Christ. The annual feast is followed by a week-long fair or fête, known in the northern Konkan region as the &quot;Bandra fair&quot;. The fair is thronged by lakhs of tourists, pilgrims and devotees every year. Many visitors come to Mount St Mary Church in order to make their &quot;mannat&quot; (wish) come true.

Pope Pius XII granted a decree of canonical coronation to the shrine&#x27;s reverenced Marian icon on 21 October 1954, both signed and notarised by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini of the Sacred Congregation of Rites. The statue of the Madonna and the Prince of peace was crowned in a ceremony on 5 December 1954, by the late Cardinal Valerian Gracias.

==The basilica==
The basilica stands on a hillock, about 80 metres above sea level overlooking the Arabian Sea. It draws thousands of devotees and pilgrims annually, especially during the Bandra Fest. Many visitors attest to the miracles worked by the supernatural power of St Mary at Mount Bandra. The shrine attracts people from all faiths who plead for favours, with others coming back expressing their gratitude. The church was raided and destroyed in 1738 during the Mahratta Invasion of Bassein, led by the Peshva Brahmin Chimaji Appa. It was rebuilt in the British Bombay era.

During the Bandra Fair, the entire area is decorated with festoons and buntings. Many pitch up stalls to sell religious articles, flowers, snacks and sweets. Wax figures of the Virgin Mary along with an assortment of candles shaped like hands, feet and various other parts of the body are sold at kiosks. The sick and the suffering choose a candle or wax figure that corresponds to their ailment or request and light it inside the church with the hope that Mother Mary will heed their appeals for help.

==Statue of the Virgin Mary==

Although the current structure and edifice of the shrine is just 100 years old, as it was rebuilt in British Bombay, the history behind the current statue of Blessed Mary goes back to the 16th century, when Jesuit priests brought the statue and constructed a chapel on Mount Bandra, which was then a part of the Portuguese East Indies. In 1700, Sunni Arab pirates raiding the area, were interested in the gilt-lined object held in the hand &amp; desecrated the statue by cutting off the right hand.

In 1760, the church was rebuilt after the Mahratta Invasion of Goa and Bombay ended, following which the statue was substituted with a statue of Our Lady of Navigators from the St Andrew&#x27;s Church nearby. Legend has it that a Koli Christian fisherman, dreamt of the statue floating in the sea, as prophesied in the dream, the statue was indeed found the next day, floating in the sea. A Jesuit annual letter dated to 1669 and published in the book &quot;St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bandra&quot; (1616–1966) supports this claim. Koli fisherfolk call the statue as Mot Maoli, literally meaning the &quot;Pearl Mother&quot; or &quot;the Mother of the Mount&quot;; &quot;mot&quot; could be a corruption of the Indo-Portuguese word &quot;monte&quot; for &quot;mount&quot;; &quot;maoli&quot; is a Marathi-Konkani word for &quot;mother&quot;. The original statue is now restored and is enshrined in a place of honour at the basilica. Bombay East Indians as well as Hindus visit this shrine often, making the place a prominent feature of intercommunal harmony and interfaith dialogue for Mumbai (Bombay).

<doc id="626645" wikidata="Q816556" url="?curid=626645" title="Ben Lomond">
<text>Ben Lomond (, ), , is a mountain in the Scottish Highlands. Situated on the eastern shore of Loch Lomond, it is the most southerly of the Munros. Ben Lomond lies within the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park and the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, property of the National Trust for Scotland.

Its accessibility from Glasgow and elsewhere in central Scotland, together with the relative ease of ascent from Rowardennan, makes it one of the most popular of all the Munros: it is estimated that around 30,000 people reach the summit each year. On a clear day, it is visible from the higher grounds of Glasgow and across Strathclyde. Ben Lomond&#x27;s summit can also be seen from Ben Nevis, the highest peak in Britain, over away. The West Highland Way runs along the western base of the mountain, by the loch.

Ben Lomond&#x27;s popularity in Scotland has resulted in several namesakes in the former English colonies Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United States – see this list. The mountain is mentioned directly in the popular folk song &quot;The Bonnie Banks o&#x27; Loch Lomond&quot;.

The name &quot;Ben Lomond&quot; is generally agreed to mean &quot;beacon mountain&quot; or &quot;beacon hill&quot;. &quot;Lomond&quot; is of Brittonic origin and derived from the element &quot;lumon&quot; meaning &quot;a beacon&quot; (Welsh &quot;llumon&quot;). This element, preserved in Scots as &quot;lum&quot; meaning &quot;chimney&quot;, is found in other hill-names such as the Lomond Hills in Fife and Pumlumon in Wales. Like these hills, Ben Lomond is likely to have been perceived as a central point, probably the meeting-point of several territorial boundaries, where a signal beacon may have been frequently lit.

==Geography and geology==

Ben Lomond has a craggy summit which appears conical when viewed from the nearby Arrochar Alps range. The mountain comprises two parallel south-southeasterly ridges: the Sròn Aonaich ridge to the east and the Ptarmigan ridge to the west. North of the summit these ridges come together and lead to a col with Cruin a&#x27; Bheinn, a Graham. The summit is grassy and rocky and is marked by a triangulation pillar.

Ben Lomond&#x27;s geology is dominated by granite, mica schist, diorite, porphyry and quartzite. Ben Lomond lies on the Scottish watershed, the drainage divide which separates river systems that flow to the east from those that flow to the west.

==Ascent routes==
The usual route up Ben Lomond is via the &#x27;tourist path&#x27;, a wide, eroded and easy path which is roughly paved in steeper sections. This track was created owing to the mountain&#x27;s status as one of the most popular in Scotland and climbs the gentle Sròn Aonaich ridge, before ascending a steeper section to the rocky summit ridge.

An alternative route follows the Ptarmigan ridge to the summit along a steeper and rockier path. The Ptarmigan path is the second most popular route, followed by a third route which approaches from Gleann Dubh.

Despite the comparative ease of the tourist route, Ben Lomond can present a significant challenge to inexperienced walkers, especially in poor weather conditions. A dedicated Lomond Mountain Rescue Team has existed since 1967 to assist walkers and climbers on Ben Lomond and other surrounding peaks.

==Fauna==
The higher regions of the mountain support an alpine tundra ecozone, hosting bird species including peregrine falcon, merlins, rock ptarmigan, red grouse and golden eagles. A study by the British Trust for Ornithology found that Ben Lomond may host the most southerly breeding ptarmigan population in Scotland, following the decline of populations on Goatfell and the Arran mountains, possibly as a result of climate change.

In addition to natural wildlife, the mountain area supports sheep farming. The National Trust for Scotland is tasked with maintaining a land management programme which sustains a balance of natural habitat conservation and the availability of land for grazing.

==Memorial Park and National Park==
Since 1995, the area around Ben Lomond, including the mountain summit, has been designated as a war memorial, called the Ben Lomond National Memorial Park. The park is dedicated to those who gave their lives in the First and Second World Wars and was created out of the former Rowardennan Estate with the support of the National Heritage Memorial Fund.

The Memorial Park was officially opened on Armistice Day in 1997 by the Rt Hon Donald Dewar, then Secretary of State for Scotland and later the first First Minister of Scotland. At the opening ceremony he unveiled a granite sculpture by Doug Cocker, a Scottish artist who had won a competition organised by the Scottish Sculpture Trust to design a permanent monument for the park.

At the time of its creation, management of the Memorial Park was entrusted to the NTS, Forestry Commission and the now defunct Scottish Office.

In 2002, the Scottish Parliament created the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park, the first national park in Scotland. The national park includes the whole of Ben Lomond National Memorial Park.

<text>Dahisar (Marathi pronunciation: ) is the northernmost suburb (and railway station) of Mumbai. Not to be confused with Dahisar Mori in Navi Mumbai.

On the Mumbai Suburban Railway (which is part of the Indian Western Railway line), that runs from Churchgate to Virar, Dahisar is immediately north and next to the populous suburb of Borivali, which has a train station of the same name.

==History==
There is a record of continuous habitation since the 1630s, as per parish records of the Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church.. The word is most probably coming from the ancient Prakrit language of which a Sanskritized version would be Dadhīśvaraḥ (=IAST, Dadhishvar).

Dahisar was originally a part of Thane District; it became a part of Mumbai in 1956.

Borivali has developed from what was once a congregate region of smaller towns namely Eksar, Poisar, Vazira, Shimpoli, Mandpeshwar, Dattapada, Kanheri, Tulsi, Magathane and Gorai, which were situated on and around Mount Poinsur, between the Dahisar River and Poisar River.

It is believed that the name &quot;Borivali&quot; comes from the existence of many bushes of a sweet fruit called &quot; (Marathi) meaning &quot;berries&quot; in English. Hence, the name means the town of berries literally &quot;bori-vali&quot;. The existence of the ancient temple of Lord Ganesha &quot;Shree Svayambhu Ganpati Devalaya&quot; in Vazira Naka area.

The pre-historic era&#x27;s &quot;Mandpeshwar&quot; (“An 8th Century remains of a beautiful Edifice structure, Mandapeshwar caves is a rock cut architecture and a Hindu shrine of lord Shiva located near Borivali IC Colony, at walking distance from Dahisar Railway Station”) and &quot;Kanheri caves&quot; stand testament to the rich history of this place. Borivali was spelt &quot;Berewlee&quot; by the then ruled India under the British Raj. It is also spelt and pronounced as &quot;Borivli&quot;.

Borivali is densely populated but continues to retain some green cover due to the presence of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park, previously known as the &quot;Borivali National Park&quot; in the east and the mangroves in the west end of Borivali.

<text>Goregaon () is a suburb of Mumbai city, in the Mumbai Suburban district of India. It has a railway station on the Mumbai suburban railway on the Western Line. An extension of the Harbour Line was completed in 2018 due to which it has regular trains to CSMT. This is in addition to existing trains to Churchgate on the Western Line. Owing to rapid urbanization (mainly due to construction of metro lines) and the growing population of metropolitan Mumbai, Goregaon, which was once a hilly forest region is now a crowded suburb of Mumbai.

Mumbai local trains originate and terminate at Goregaon. Platforms 1 and 2 operate slow trains towards Churchgate and CSMT whereas Platform 7 operates fast trains towards Churchgate. 

Marathi is the most spoken language in Goregaon. East Indian communities, Panchkalshi or Somvanshi Kshatriya Pathare (SKP) and Koli&#x27;s are the native people of this area. 

== Transport ==
Goregaon Railway Station is the transport hub of Goregaon. The station currently has seven platforms, two of which are new harbor-line platforms, and was expanded as a part of the Harbour Line extension (under MUTP 2) from Andheri. The expansion, involving two additional platforms and an elevated deck with passenger amenities (on the western side of the existing station) was completed in 2018.

A recently constructed skywalk connects one of the foot-over-bridges to S. V. Road near Citi Centre, a shopping complex near the M. G. Road junction.
BEST has bus stations on both the Western and the Eastern sides of the railway station. Goregaon Bus Depot, however, is located away from the railway station, on Link Road. The link road has seen an increase in the traffic of late after the commencement of the Mumbai Metro construction work.

There is a new flyover at Ram Mandir road, connecting Goregaon West and Goregaon East. In addition, Ram Mandir railway station is operational since December 2016. The next important transport project for Goregaon will be the GMLR (Goregaon Mulund Link Road) which will be a 5km underground road consisting of two tunnels each having three lanes. This road will link Goregaon to Bhandup.

The upcoming Metro line (Line 2) between Dahisar to Mankhurd will further improve the connectivity of this western suburb with the far-off eastern suburbs of the city. Currently, this section of the Metro Rail Project is under construction.

==Nature and conservation==
Goregaon shares a coundary with the Sanjay Gandhi National Park from the south-western side and is home to the Conservation Education Centre (CEC), run by the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). The area is home to a diverse flora and fauna.

Recent development on the eastern side has led to a huge amount of deforestation. Leopard sightings and even the occasional attacks are not very rare and not just in the hamlets inside the Aarey Milk Colony but also in large residential colonies like Nagari Nivara Parishad.

<doc id="626652" wikidata="Q702746" url="?curid=626652" title="Frederick I, Duke of Württemberg">
<text>Friedrich I of Württemberg (19 August 1557 – 29 January 1608) was the son of George of Mömpelgard and his wife Barbara of Hesse, daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse.

Several references are made to him in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;, in which a series of anti-German jokes start with a horse theft, several references are made to German travellers in England and to a German duke who is &quot;not&quot; expected to come to Windsor.

==Early life and education==
Frederick of Mömpelgard was born in Mömpelgard present day Montbéliard, France, the son of George I of Württemberg-Mömpelgard of Montbéliard and his wife Barbara of Hesse, daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse.
He spent his youth at the Württemberg court in Stuttgart, where Christoph, Duke of Württemberg himself took care of his education. From 1571 to 1574 he was educated in the later Collegium Illustre in Tübingen.

==Career==
Frederick visited various courts in Germany, Denmark, Hungary, Austria, France, Italy and England. He signed the Formula of Concord of 1577 and the Book of Concord of 1580.

In 1592, Frederick was heir apparent to the dukedom of Württemberg when he visited Windsor and other English cities. He desired to become a Knight of the Garter and repeatedly solicited Queen Elizabeth for the honor. After he had inherited the dukedom and become more prominent, she admitted him to the order. In a calculated slight, he was not informed of his admission in time to attend the investiture in spring 1597, the ceremony for which The Merry Wives of Windsor was written. Comic references to Mömpelgard&#x27;s earlier visit and his absence from Windsor intended for the play&#x27;s first audience, taken from the first private performance, appear in the First Folio edition of the play. These references were not included in the 1602 Quarto derived from public theatrical production.

On 4 October 1603 he was invested in the Order of the Garter by a delegation of James VI and I. Sir Robert Spencer and William Dethick brought him the insignia of the order. His councillor Benjamin von Buwinckhausen helped organise the ceremonies in the church and castle at Stuttgart. The jewels including two garters with diamonds and rubies, and two St Georges with diamonds and rubies, and a gold chain or collar, made by the London goldsmiths, John Spilman and William Herrick.

In 1599, Frederick I issued an order that a new town should be established at the northern extremity of the Black Forest by the name of Freudenstadt. The aim was for the town to become the new residence of the Duchy of Württemberg as it was closer to Mömpelgard than the Württemberg capital Stuttgart. However, Frederick I died in 1608, aged 50, in Stuttgart, and his plans never came to fruition.

== Children ==
The sons of Frederick I established the ducal house of Württemberg-Neuenstadt, a branch line of the House of Württemberg after a &quot;Fürstbrüderlicher Vergleich&quot; – a mutual agreement made between ducal brothers on 7 June 1617. The eldest son, Johann Friedrich, assumed barony over the Duchy of Württemberg while the second youngest son, Frederick Achilles, was bequeathed Neuenstadt Castle and an annual endowment of 10,000 guilder.

Frederick and his spouse Sibylla of Anhalt (1564–1614), daughter of Joachim Ernst, Prince of Anhalt, had the following children:

* Johann Frederick (1582–1628)
* George Frederick (1583–1591)
* Sibylla Elisabeth (1584–1606) - married John George I, Elector of Saxony
* Elisabeth (born and died in 1585)
* Louis Frederick (1586–1631), founder of the later branch line of Württemberg-Mömpelgard

* Eva Christina (1590–1657) - married John George of Brandenburg (1577–1624), Duke of Jägerndorf, son of Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg
* Frederick Achilles (1591–1631)
* Agnes (1592–1629) - married Francis Julius of Saxe-Lauenburg (1584–1634)
* Barbara of Württemberg (1593–1627) - married Margrave Frederick V of Baden-Durlach
* Magnus (de) (1594–1622), fell in the Battle of Wimpfen
* August (born and died in 1596)

<text>EverBank Stadium is an American football stadium in Jacksonville, Florida, United States. It is the home facility of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL), and the headquarters of the professional wrestling promotions All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and Ring of Honor (ROH).

The stadium opened in 1995 as Jacksonville Municipal Stadium on the site of the old Gator Bowl Stadium (erected 1927), and included some portions of the older stadium. Located on the St. Johns River, it sits on of land in downtown Jacksonville. In addition to hosting the Jaguars, the stadium is regularly used for college football, concerts, and other events. It is the regular site of the annual Florida–Georgia football rivalry game, a matchup between the Florida Gators of the University of Florida and the Georgia Bulldogs of the University of Georgia. The stadium is also the home of the annual Gator Bowl, a post-season college bowl game. Additionally, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005 and is one of the venues used by the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team.

From 1997 to 2006, the stadium was named Alltel Stadium after communications company Alltel purchased naming rights. The facility was renamed EverBank Field in 2010, following the approval of a five-year, naming rights deal with the financial services company EverBank. The agreement was extended in 2014 for an additional 10 years. The Jaguars announced in February 2018 the stadium would be renamed TIAA Bank Field for the 2018 NFL season after EverBank was acquired by New York–based Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America (TIAA). In June 2023, the Jaguars announced the team&#x27;s home stadium would be renamed EverBank Stadium prior to the start of the season.

The stadium temporarily played host to the New Orleans Saints during the 2021 NFL season after the team was forced to relocate from Caesars Superdome owing to the aftermath of Hurricane Ida.
==Construction==
EverBank Stadium is located in the Stadium District of downtown Jacksonville, which has been home to football fields since the early 20th century. In 1928 the first permanent football stadium, Fairfield Stadium, was constructed. In 1948 this was expanded and renamed Gator Bowl Stadium, in honor of the annual Gator Bowl game first played two years earlier.

The current structure was built using a few portions of the historic Gator Bowl Stadium. However, all of the elements included from the older stadium—the pedestrian ramp system and the more recent West Upper Deck section of the complex—dated back only to 1982. Construction started January 3, 1994, and the new stadium opened on August 18, 1995, with an exhibition game with the St. Louis Rams. Total construction time was under 20 months and total cost was US$134 million—$60 million of which was provided by the city of Jacksonville.

===Planning===
In January 1993, representatives from the University of Florida and University of Georgia began negotiating with Jacksonville representatives to renew the contract to host the Florida–Georgia game, the annual rivalry game between the college football teams of the two universities. The universities&#x27; five-year contract with the Gator Bowl ended after the 1994 game, and the Citrus Bowl had offered Florida and Georgia a larger sum of money than the Gator Bowl for the right to host the game.

To counter the Citrus Bowl&#x27;s larger monetary offer, Jacksonville mayor Ed Austin proposed a $25.5 million renovation plan to Jacksonville&#x27;s aging Gator Bowl Stadium, which had been built in 1949. Both teams had expressed concerns about the condition of the aging stadium, and renovations were considered key to enticing the teams to keep returning to Jacksonville, bringing tens of millions of dollars in consumer spending with them. Despite the promise of renovations, Georgia athletic director Vince Dooley was unswayed, so Austin widened the scope of the renovations, increasing their price tag to $49 million, and traveled to Athens, Georgia, to talk with Dooley in person. Austin&#x27;s campaigning was partially successful. On March 23, 1993, the two universities announced they had signed a five-year contract with the Gator Bowl, running from 1997 to 2002. The contract was contingent on Austin successfully passing the $49 million renovation bond issue through the Jacksonville City Council and the city completing the renovations by the 1996 game. On Tuesday, May 11, the Jacksonville City Council approved a $219.5 million bond issue, including the $49 million for the renovation of the Gator Bowl.

===NFL expansion===
Soon after the approval of the bond issue, investors interested in attracting a new National Football League team to Jacksonville requested that another $30 million be added to the $49 million renovations in order to make the stadium more attractive for a professional team. That number climbed higher throughout the summer, and eventually the city reached an agreement with the leading group of investors hoping to attract an NFL team to Jacksonville. On July 1, the city and investors reached a lease agreement contingent on the city investing $112.3 million for improving the Gator Bowl. The lease agreement later collapsed when the Jacksonville City Council voted to send the lease back to a committee for further study rather than approving it. One month after the proposed deal fell through, city officials and investors tried again and were successful in negotiating a deal that included a pledge to spend $121 million on renovations to the Gator Bowl. Due to the expanded renovations, it was announced that the 1994 Florida-Georgia game would have to be moved out of the Gator Bowl, as had the 1995 game, in order to provide time for the newly expanded renovation plan to be completed before 1996. In the end, the expanded bond issue and renovation program proved to be successful, as Jacksonville was awarded the 30th NFL franchise—the Jacksonville Jaguars—on November 30, 1993.

Almost as soon as the celebration surrounding Jacksonville&#x27;s new NFL team died down, a renovation contractor&#x27;s plan to give 8% of the stadium work to minority-owned businesses drew criticism. The NAACP and another group said African-American businesses should have been awarded twice that amount of work.

==Current stadium==


The stadium&#x27;s re-opening day was also the home debut of the Jaguars during the 1995 NFL season. It was the first time that an expansion NFL team had played its first game in a new facility; they played the Houston Oilers in the opener and lost 10–3. The Gator Bowl returned as a New Year&#x27;s Day bowl game on January 1, 1996, following the 1995 NCAA season.

The stadium contains 11,200 club seats, 88 luxury suites, and a &quot;super suite&quot;.

In 1997, the stadium changed its name to Alltel Stadium after naming rights were acquired by Alltel, a telecommunications company best known as a wireless carrier. The name Alltel Stadium stopped being used by the city after January 2007 when the contract expired; by that point, most of Alltel&#x27;s assets had been purchased by Verizon.

In 2005, the stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXIX in which the New England Patriots defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 24–21 in front of 78,125, the largest Super Bowl in attendance since 1994. Paul McCartney performed at halftime, performing Beatles classics &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;, and &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, as well as a firework-filled &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. In 2003 and 2004, $47 million in improvements to the stadium were implemented to prepare for the Super Bowl. These improvements included the addition of a unique sports bar in the south end zone called the &quot;Bud Zone&quot;, a larger and wider video and scoring display from Daktronics, escalators in the north and south end zone, and a new &quot;terrace suite&quot; called the &quot;Sky Patio&quot; right above the &quot;Bud Zone&quot; in the south end zone.

Before the 2005 season, mainly due to low attendance figures and looming blackouts, team officials installed a series of tarps to reduce the seating capacity for Jaguars games. The covers were placed to block out seven sections in the upper north end zone and four in each upper deck section, located on the corners of each. This puts 9,703 seats out of service, leaving the stadium with 66,851 seats for the regular season. However, in the event the Jaguars make the AFC Championship Game, the stadium can easily be expanded to full capacity. Some believed that this was a sign that the city couldn&#x27;t support an NFL team; the city is the second-smallest market in the league. However, the current capacity is actually very close to what Wayne Weaver included in his original proposal to bring the Gator Bowl up to NFL standards. The city council turned this plan down, mainly out of concern for not having enough seats to accommodate the annual Florida-Georgia game.

Despite the changes, however, blackouts have still occurred, including two of their first three home games in 2007 and nine of ten games in 2009. It is believed that the 2008 US financial crisis played a major part in the 2009 season blackouts, leading to insufficient ticket sales, with only the final home engagement of the regular season, with the Indianapolis Colts, managing to sell out. However, the Jaguars&#x27; 2010 season saw a huge turnaround in ticket sales, with no games being blacked out that year. The Jaguars avoided blackouts in all games in 2011 and 2012.

For the Super Bowl, Florida–Georgia game, and occasionally the Gator Bowl, temporary bleachers are put up in the south end zone, raising capacity to over 84,000.

The attendance record was set on September 29, 2007, when 85,413 watched Florida State defeat Alabama in what was dubbed the River City Showdown. Each school received nearly 36,000 tickets, and the Gator Bowl Association added 5,800 seats.

On July 26, 2010, naming rights to the stadium were bought by EverBank, one of the nation&#x27;s largest privately held bank holding companies. On August 10, the deal was officially approved by the Jacksonville City Council with a 14–3 vote.

In November 2013, Jacksonville&#x27;s City Council approved $63 million in improvements to EverBank Field. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan helped finance $20 million of the cost. Renovations included two end zone video scoreboards long that are the largest HD LED of their kind in the world, a platform area in the north end zone with two wading pools, unique food and beverage offerings, interactive activities, and of HD video screens, which is a world record for a stadium. Construction of the platform resulted in the removal of approximately 7,000 seats, though temporary seating can be installed for major events that will require a larger stadium capacity. During the construction a live webcam was set up to view the progress of the new video scoreboards. The scoreboards were publicly unveiled on July 26, 2014.

In the middle of 2016, the Jaguars and the city of Jacksonville announced $90 million in improvements to the stadium. Phase 1 includes the improvements to club seating, sponsored by US Assure, new walkout patios at the 50-yard-line and the creation of a new south end zone tunnel that will be the new team entrance and create two new seating environments. Phase 2 includes the construction of an amphitheater (Daily&#x27;s Place) and a covered flex field; both phases were completed in May 2017.

After the successful 2017 season which saw the Jaguars return to the playoffs for the first time since the 2007 season and host a playoff game for the first time since 1999, the Jaguars announced the removal of the last of the tarps on the upper levels. The removal adds 3,501 seats to the capacity of the stadium bringing total capacity to 67,814.

The stadium is planned to undergo wholesale renovations around 2025 and 2026, with initial plans including a reduction in capacity to 60,000. This could force the Jaguars, the Gator Bowl, and the Florida–Georgia game to temporarily play elsewhere during the reconstruction. In June 2023, the Jaguars unveiled plans for the renovation of the stadium. Dubbed the &quot;Stadium of the Future&quot;, the plans include a 360 degree concourse, an energy-efficient facade, and a large canopy to provide shade. Capacity will be reduced to 62,000, expandable to 71,500 for college football games.

The stadium was temporarily rebranded to TrEverBank Stadium before the Jaguars&#x27; 2024 season 18–13 home opener loss against the Cleveland Browns, in an allude to Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence through a publicity stunt as part of his collaboration with EverBank.

<text>Ainsi soit je... (a play on &quot;ainsi soit-il&quot;, which can mean either &quot;so be it&quot; or &quot;amen&quot;) is the second album by Mylène Farmer, released on March 18, 1988. It contains the hit singles &quot;Sans contrefaçon&quot;, &quot;Pourvu qu&#x27;elles soient douces&quot; and &quot;Sans logique&quot;. Generally well received by critics, it was very successful and remains to date the second best-selling album of the singer.

== Background ==
After the success of the album &quot;Cendres de lune&quot; and the hits &quot;Sans contrefaçon&quot; and &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot;, Farmer had no problem releasing a second album that would be well received by the public, enabling her to consolidate her growing popularity, thus preventing her from slipping back into anonymity. The album took from five to six months to be finished. It was recorded at studio Mega, Avenue Maréchal-Maunoury, in Paris (XVIe arrondissement) under the leadership of Thierry Rogen, a renowned sound engineer who had already worked in particular with Michel Sardou.

The cover of the album shows Farmer turned sideways, accompanied by the puppet used in the music video for &quot;Sans contrefaçon&quot;. The photographs of the booklet were made by Elsa Trillat.

The album was released in April 1988 and met great success, both critically and commercially.

== Lyrics and music ==
The texts, which contain many literary references to famous authors (such as Baudelaire, Poe, etc.), were written by Mylène Farmer, except &quot;L&#x27;Horloge&quot; (a poem by Charles Baudelaire), &quot;Déshabillez-moi&quot; (originally sung in 1966 by Juliette Gréco) and &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Conclusion&quot; (which is an instrumental song). The album has a melancholy and sad tone, and deals with death, suicide, madness with gloomy and desperate texts. Sexual ambiguity, sodomy and provocation are also tackled.

== Critical reception ==

The album was generally well received in the media and remains sometimes considered as &quot;one of the most successful&quot;, even the singer&#x27;s &quot;best album&quot;. When the album was released, the press said: &quot;Mylène shows an imagination and a new maturity in these charming libertine poems and her synthetic hits containing literary references&quot; (&quot;20 Ans&quot;). This &quot;great&quot; (&quot;Gaipied&quot;) and &quot;successful&quot; (&quot;Les Dernières Nouvelles d&#x27;Alsace&quot;) album has &quot;an intellectual and musical universe always so creative&quot; (&quot;Gaipied&quot;). Its songs were described as &quot;powerful, sometimes catchy and often spellbinding compositions&quot; (&quot;Paris Nuit&quot;), whose texts are &quot;chiseled but perfectly licentious&quot; (&quot;France Soir&quot;). The &quot;poetic quality of the texts&quot; and &quot;the sense of the melody&quot; (&quot;Le Télégramme&quot;) were also mentioned. &quot;Rock and Folk&quot; said this Laurent Boutonnat&#x27;s production is &quot;impeccable&quot;, demonstrating his &quot;undoubted talent&quot;. According to &quot;Télé Poche&quot;, &quot;the time of success has come for Mylène Farmer&quot; with this album. The journalist Caroline Bee said this album is &quot;an ambiguous, bright, romantic and beautifully produced gem&quot;. A review in Pan-European magazine &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; praised &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot;, ranking it as &quot;Album of the week&quot;, and added: &quot;A first-class electro-based pop LP... That sophisticated sensuality! Laurent Boutonnat&#x27;s production and compositions are flowing with a commerciabdity, comparable to the works of the Pet Shop Boys. Farmer... reveals the full palette of her caressing and dreamy voice.&quot;

Some criticisms were also made against &quot;Ainsi soit je...&quot; For example, according to &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;, this album uses an &quot;old-fashioned stylistic mannerism to reinvent poetry&quot; (&quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;). &quot;Rock Land&quot; qualified this album as a &quot;second collection of bad thoughts with a spectacular flippantly&quot;, whose &quot;B-side is flat&quot;.

== Commercial performance ==
In France, the album debuted at number 8 in April 1988, but it dropped to number 26 five months later. However, thanks to the successful single &quot;Pourvu qu&#x27;elles soient douces&quot; (number-one hit in December 1988), the album reached number one for two weeks in December 1988. The album managed to stay for eleven months in the top ten and about one year on the chart. On 29 June 1988, the album was certified Gold by the SNEP for 100,000 copies sold, then Platinum for 300,000 sales, then Double Platinum on 17 February 1989 for 600,000 sales, and eventually Diamond on 14 November 1989 for a minimum of 1,000,000 copies sold. The album was also released in Germany, where it reached number 47.

<text>Michael Murphy (born September 3, 1930) is the co-founder of the Esalen Institute, a key figure in the Human Potential Movement and author of &quot;The Future of the Body&quot; and other books on topics related to extraordinary human potential.

==Life and career==
Michael Murphy was born September 3, 1930, to an Irish father and Basque mother in Salinas, California.

In April 1950, while enrolled in the pre-med program at Stanford University, he mistakenly wandered into a lecture on comparative religions. This lecture so fanned the flame of his interest in the integration of Eastern and Western thought that he enrolled in the class and subsequently began meditation.

On January 15, 1951, during seated meditation by Lake Lagunita at Stanford, he experienced what he describes as a &quot;hinge moment&quot;, after which he dropped out of the pre-med program with a new vision for the purpose of his life.

He continued with his formal education, earning his B.A. in psychology in 1952 from Stanford University. After graduation, he was drafted by the US Army and spent two years stationed in Puerto Rico as a psychologist. He returned to Stanford for two quarters of graduate studies in philosophy before he quit in 1956 to go to India.

===India===

During 1956 and 1957 Murphy practiced meditation for 18 months at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Puducherry, India. It is likely that his ideas related to the connection between human evolution, human potential, and spiritual growth developed further here.

===Founding Esalen===

In 1960, while in residence at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram Cultural Integration Fellowship in San Francisco, he met a fellow Stanford University graduate, Dick Price. In 1962, they founded Esalen Institute together in Big Sur, California on of property owned by Murphy&#x27;s family.

In 1972 he retired from actively running Esalen to do more writing. He remains on the board at the institute and continues to be a key contributor to research projects at the Esalen Center for Theory and Research. He presently resides in Mill Valley, California.

===Further contributions===

In the 1980s he organized Esalen&#x27;s Soviet-American Exchange Program which served as a unique form of citizen-to-citizen diplomacy. The program initiated the process that led to Boris Yeltsin&#x27;s first visit to the US 1990.

In 1992 he published &quot;The Future of the Body&quot;, a massive historical and cross-cultural collection of documentation of various occurrences of extraordinary human functioning such as healing, hypnosis, martial arts, yogic techniques, telepathy, clairvoyance, and feats of superhuman strength. Rather than presenting such documentation as scientific proof, he presents it as a body of evidence to motivate further investigation.

He is also an avid golfer and has written two fictional books relating golf and human potential. His 1971 novel, &quot;Golf in the Kingdom&quot;, has been in constant publication since its release and has become one of the best selling golf books of all time. In 1992 it spawned The Shivas Irons Society, a 501(c)3 organization to explore the transformational potential of sport, of which Murphy is the co-chairman of the advisory board. He partnered with film producer Mindy Affrime on the feature film adaptation of &quot;Golf In The Kingdom&quot;. It was directed by Susan Streitfeld and stars David O&#x27;Hara, Mason Gamble, Malcolm McDowell and Frances Fisher. The complementary one-hour TV documentary, called &quot;Golfers in the Kingdom&quot;, was directed by Ellen Spiro.

<text>Nathaniel Hone (24 April 1718 – 14 August 1784) was an Irish-born portrait and miniature painter, and one of the founder members of the Royal Academy in 1768.

==Early life==
The son of a Dublin-based Dutch merchant, Hone moved to England as a young man and, after marrying Molly Earle - daughter of the Duke of Argyll - in 1742, eventually settled in London, by which time he had acquired a reputation as a portrait-painter. While his paintings were popular, his reputation was particularly enhanced by his skill at producing miniatures and enamels. He interrupted his time in London by spending two years (1750–1752) studying in Italy.

==Works==
As a portrait painter, several of his works are now held at the National Portrait Gallery in London. His sitters included magistrate Sir John Fielding and Methodist preacher John Wesley, and General Richard Wilford and Sir Levett Hanson in a double portrait. He often used his son John Camillus Hone (1745–1836) in some of his works, including his unique portrait of &quot;The Spartan Boy&quot;, painted in 1774.

===&quot;The Conjuror&quot;===
He courted controversy in 1775 when his satirical picture &quot;The Conjurer&quot; (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin) was seen to attack the fashion for Italian Renaissance art and to ridicule Sir Joshua Reynolds, leading the Royal Academy to reject the painting. It also originally included a nude caricature of fellow Academician Angelica Kauffman in the top left corner, which was painted out by Hone after Kauffman complained to the academy. The combination of a little girl and an old man has also been seen as symbolic of Kauffman and Reynolds&#x27;s closeness, age difference, and rumoured affair. To show that his reputation was undamaged, Hone organised a one-man retrospective in London, the first such solo exhibition of an artist&#x27;s work.
==Family==
The Hone family is related to the old Dutch landed family the van Vianens, who hold the hereditary title of Vrijheer. His great-grandnephew shared the same name and was also a notable Irish painter, known as Nathaniel Hone the Younger (1831–1917). He is also a relation to painter Evie Hone. Hone had two sons, both of whom became artists, John Camillus and Horace.

<text>Clifford Charles Devlin Thorburn (born 16 January 1948) is a Canadian retired professional snooker player. Nicknamed &quot;The Grinder&quot; because of his slow, determined style of play, he won the World Snooker Championship in 1980, defeating Alex Higgins 18–16 in the final. He is generally recognised as the sport&#x27;s first world champion from outside the United Kingdom—since Australian Horace Lindrum&#x27;s 1952 title is usually disregarded—and he remains the only world champion from the Americas. He was runner-up in two other world championships, losing 21–25 to John Spencer in the 1977 final and 6–18 to Steve Davis in the 1983 final. At the 1983 tournament, Thorburn became the first player to make a maximum break in a World Championship match, achieving the feat in his second-round encounter with Terry Griffiths.

Ranked world number one during the 1981–82 season, Thorburn was the first non-British player to top the snooker world rankings. He won the invitational Masters in 1983, 1985, and 1986, making him the first player to win the tournament three times and the first to retain the title. He retired from the main professional tour in 1996. Inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Snooker Hall of Fame in 2014, he competed later in his career in Snooker Legends events and on the World Seniors Tour, winning the 2018 Seniors Masters at the Crucible Theatre at age 70. He retired from competitive snooker after the 2022 UK Seniors Championship.

==Early life==
Thorburn was born on 16 January 1948 in Victoria, British Columbia. His parents separated when he was eighteen months old. He was abandoned by his mother, and after spending about two years in an orphanage during a custody dispute, was raised by his father and his paternal grandmother. He was told that his mother had died, but, aged twenty, learnt that she was still alive.

He played pool and lacrosse in his youth, and set a one-game scoring record of ten goals in the Greater Victoria Minor Lacrosse Association &quot;midget division&quot; in 1958. He left school at the age of 16, and travelled across Canada playing pool and snooker money matches, taking jobs as a dishwasher and working on a garbage truck to help earn money for his stakes. In 1968 he entered his first tournaments, and won the Toronto City Championship. He spent time with Fred Davis and Rex Williams when they toured Canada in 1970, and afterwards became a resident professional at the House of Champions club in Toronto.

In July 1970, he reportedly made a maximum break of 147 in a non-competitive game against Fred Hardwick. He made six century breaks in winning the North American Amateur Championship in 1971, equalling the record, jointly held by Joe Davis and George Chenier, for most century breaks in a single tournament.

==Early professional career==
Thorburn played John Spencer in a series of three exhibition matches in 1971; although he lost all three, he was recommended by Spencer to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, and he was accepted as a professional in 1972. Thorburn travelled to England in 1973, and on the day of his arrival, the reigning world snooker champion Alex Higgins offered to play him for £5 a frame. Thorburn, receiving 28 points start in each frame, claims to have beaten Higgins in every frame they played, and that Higgins refused to pay up.

At the 1973 World Snooker Championship, his first major tournament on the professional snooker circuit, Thorburn defeated Dennis Taylor 9–8 in the first round then lost 15–16 to Williams in the second round. Later that year, he had a 4–0 win over Pat Houlihan at the 1973 Norwich Union Open before losing 2–4 to Higgins in the quarter-final. In the 1974 World Snooker Championship he defeated Alex McDonald 8–3 in qualifying then lost 4–8 to Paddy Morgan in the first round. He started the 1974–75 snooker season with a victory in the 1974 Canadian Open, knocking out Willie Thorne and Graham Miles to reach the final, where he won 8–6 against Taylor. He reached the quarter-finals of the 1975 World Snooker Championship with wins over Morgan and Miles, losing the quarter-final 12–19 to Eddie Charlton, and, the following year, was eliminated 14–15 by Higgins in the first round of the 1976 World Snooker Championship.

The 1977 World Snooker Championship was the first to be held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Thorburn became the first Canadian world snooker championship finalist. He whitewashed Chris Ross 11–0 in qualifying, then recorded a 13–6 win over Williams. In the quarter-final, he won in the deciding frame, 13–12, against Charlton. He overcame Taylor 18–16 in the semi-final, and twelve hours later was facing Spencer in the final. Spencer built a 4–2 lead at the end of the first , but Thorburn won four of the next six frames and they finished the second session level at 6–6. Thorburn took the first two frames of the third session, and it finished with them level again, at 9–9. Thorburn built a 13–11 lead during the fourth session, and extended it to 15–11 before Spencer won four consecutive frames to make it 15–15; the next session again saw them share the frames, finishing at 18–18. Spencer won three frames in a row to lead 21–18, and Thorburn took the next two to trail by a single frame. Spencer took the last frame of the session, leading 22–20. In the last session, Thorburn again narrowed the gap to one frame, but then Spencer won three in a row to achieve victory at 25–21.

Thorburn reached the final of the 1978 Masters with wins over Doug Mountjoy and Spencer, losing 5–7 to Higgins in the final. He was knocked out of the 1978 World Snooker Championship by Charlton, 12–13 in the quarter-finals. In the 1978–79 snooker season he defeated Tony Meo 17–15 in the final to win the 1978 Canadian Open after having trailed 6–10 at the end of the first day of the final, but lost his opening matches in both the Masters (4–5 to Perrie Mans) and the World Championship (10–13 to John Virgo). He retained his Canadian Open title in 1979, taking a 10–3 lead over Terry Griffiths before winning the match in the deciding frame, at 17–16.

==1980s==
===1980 world snooker champion===
Thorburn had defeated Virgo 6–1 in the round robin phase of the 1980 Bombay International, but lost 7–13 to him in the final. He won 5–3 against Virgo in the first round of the 1980 Masters, then lost 3–5 to Griffiths in the quarter-final. In advance of the 1980 World Championship, he practiced at a club near the Crucible that was owned by a friend, and gave up smoking and drinking alcohol for a week before the tournament. His first match was against Mountjoy, Thorburn finishing their first session behind 3–5. In the evening, he played cards and drank alcohol with friends until 5:00am, resuming the match the next day by winning the first five frames in succession. Thorburn won the match 13–10. In the quarter-final, he beat Jim Wych 13–6, having led 5–3, and 10–6. He led David Taylor 5–3 after their first semi-final session, and 11–4 at the end of the second. In the last session of the match, Thorburn extended his lead to 15–7 by the mid-session interval, then won 16–7 with a break of 114 in the 23rd frame, becoming the first player to reach a second final at the Crucible.

His opponent in the final was Higgins, the 1972 champion. Thorburn won the first frame, and Higgins won the next five. Thorburn won the seventh to make it 5–2, Higgins complaining after the frame that Thorburn had been standing in his line of sight, a claim that author and sports statistician Ian Morrison called &quot;unfounded&quot;. Higgins led 6–3 at the end of the first session, extending this to 9–5 before Thorburn levelled the match at 9–9. Writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, Sydney Friskin described the match to this point as a contrast of styles: &quot;the shrewd cumulative processes of Thorburn against the explosive break-building of Higgins&quot;. He also noted that each player had accused the other of distracting them during the match. Thorburn won the 19th and 20th frames, Higgins taking the following two to level at 11–11. Thorburn went ahead at 12–11 and 13–12, Higgins levelling the match both times, and the third session ending 13–13.

In the final session, Higgins won the first frame then Thorburn won the next two, before Higgins equalized at 15–15. Thorburn led 16–15, and missed an easy that let Higgins in to make it 16–16. With a break of 119, Thorburn moved within a frame of victory at 17–16. In the 34th frame, leading 45–9 in points, he laid a for Higgins, and made a 51 break after that to win the title. The BBC&#x27;s television coverage of the final had been interrupted by the broadcast of live footage of the Iranian Embassy Siege. The conclusion of the final was watched by 14.5million television viewers. Thorburn is generally regarded as the first player from outside the United Kingdom to win the world championship, Horace Lindrum&#x27;s victory in the 1952 World Snooker Championship usually being disregarded. After the match, Higgins said of Thorburn &quot;he&#x27;s a grinder&quot;, and the nickname &quot;The Grinder&quot; was subsequently associated with Thorburn, seen as apt for his slow, determined style of play. Thorburn has aspired to be known by the nickname &quot;Champagne Cliff&quot;, but admitted later that it never caught on.

He won the Canadian Open for a third successive year in 1980, defeating Griffiths 17–10 in the final, and was part of the Canada Team that reached the final of the 1980 World Challenge Cup, where they lost 5–8 to Wales. He led Higgins 5–1 in the semi-final of the 1981 Masters, but lost the match 5–6. At the 1981 World Championship, as defending champion, he reached the semi-final where he lost 10–16 to Steve Davis. Following a 4–10 loss to Jimmy White in the first round of the 1982 World Snooker Championship, Thorburn decided to return to Canada. Thorburn had been number two in the 1980/1981 world rankings, and reached number one in the 1981/1982 rankings. He won the 1983 Masters, recovering from 2–5 against Charlton to win 6–5 in the semi-final, and defeating Ray Reardon 9–7 in the final.

===1983 world championship maximum break===
In 1983, Thorburn became the first player to make a maximum break at the World Championship, during the fourth frame of his second-round match against Griffiths, and only the second player to make an official maximum in professional competition (after Davis at the 1982 Classic). Thorburn started the break by a . While he was completing the break, play stopped on the tournament&#x27;s second table because his friend and fellow Canadian Bill Werbeniuk wanted to watch. The match against Griffiths ended at 3:51am, Thorburn emerging as the winner, 13–12. He then defeated Kirk Stevens 13–12 (from 10–12) in the quarter-final, and Tony Knowles 16–15 (from 13–15) in the semi-final. During the semi-final, which finished at 12:45am, Thorburn learnt that his wife Barbara had suffered a miscarriage on the day of his maximum break. He played Steve Davis in the final. From 2–2 after the first four frames, Davis won four in a row to leave Thorburn behind 2–6, extending this to 2–9 at the start of the second session, and 5–12 at the end of the first day. Davis wrapped up victory on the second day, at 18–6, this being the first final at the Crucible to be completed in only three sessions. Commenting on Thorburn&#x27;s performance in the final, snooker historian Clive Everton observed that the long matches he had played in reaching the final had &quot;left him so drained... that he was able to offer only token resistance.&quot;

===1984 to 1989===
Thorburn enjoyed a resurgence in form during the 1984–85 season. He reached the final of the Grand Prix, where he lost to Dennis Taylor 2–10. In the semi-final, Thorburn had defeated the reigning world champion Steve Davis 9–7. He also reached the final of the Classic in January 1985, where he met Thorne, the latter winning five frames in a row to win 13–8 after the pair had been tied at 8–8. Thorburn was again runner-up in the 1986 Classic, this time losing to Jimmy White in the final 12–13. Thorburn fluked a pot on the in the deciding frame, to leave White requiring snookers to win. White potted the brown and , then laid a snooker on the . Thorburn failed to hit the pink, which gave White the points he needed, and White then potted the pink and black to win the title.

He won further Masters titles by defeating Mountjoy 9–6 in 1985, and White 9–5 in 1986. He became the first player ever to retain the Masters title, and the first to win it three times. Thorburn experienced success in the Scottish Masters, an invitational event which opened the snooker season, in 1985 and 1986. He defeated Thorne 9–7 in the 1985 final, and Alex Higgins 9–8 the following year. He won the opening ranking event in the 1985–86 snooker calendar, the Matchroom Trophy, where he beat Jimmy White in the final 12–10, having trailed 0–7. He was then runner-up in the corresponding event the following two seasons, 9–12 to Neal Foulds in 1986, and 5–12 to Davis in 1987.

In 1988 Thorburn was fined £10,000, had two ranking points deducted, and was banned for two ranking tournaments, by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The Association&#x27;s disciplinary committee had decided that Thorburn had brought the sport into disrepute, as a drug test that he took at the 1988 British Open showed that he had &quot;minute traces of cocaine in his urine sample&quot;. He compiled another maximum break in the 1989 Matchroom League, during a match against White.

==Later years==
Thorburn last qualified for the World Championship in 1994, where he faced Nigel Bond in the first round. Thorburn led by 9–2 but eventually lost 9–10. At the 1995 Thailand Open, ranked 54th, he defeated three players from the top 16, including second-ranked Steve Davis, to reach the semi-finals. It was the first time he had reached this stage of a major event since the 1991 European Open. He lost the semi-final 0–5 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan.

Thorburn effectively retired from the professional tournament circuit after the 1995–96 season. Ranked 91st, and having not entered for any ranking tournaments in the 1996–97 season, he was quoted as saying that when he realized he would have to take part in tournament qualifying rounds for several weeks, &quot;I just couldn&#x27;t accept that... When you&#x27;ve played at all of the major venues in front of capacity crowds, it&#x27;s hard to focus and get motivated playing with just one man and a dog watching.&quot; He played for Canada in the 1996 World Cup, where his team reached the quarter-finals.

Thorburn won over one million pounds in prize money during the course of his professional career. Playing as an amateur again, he won the Canadian Amateur Championship in 2001; he had previously won the tournament in 1974, 1975, 1976, and 1977. During the 2006 World Championship, he flew to Sheffield to unveil a life-size painting of the maximum break that he made at the tournament in 1983. Painted by the artist Michael Myers, the work is on display at the Macdonald St. Paul&#x27;s Hotel in Sheffield. Thorburn competed on the inaugural Snooker Legends Tour in 2010.

At the age of 70, Thorburn won the 2018 Seniors Masters at the Crucible Theatre, defeating Jonathan Bagley 2–0 in the final. Shortly before turning 74, he announced that the 2022 UK Seniors Championship would be his last competitive event. Thorburn played his last competitive match on 5 January 2022 against Kuldesh Johal, losing 0–3.

==Personal life==
Thorburn is the father of one son and one daughter, the latter of whom is transgender. Following his World Championship victory, he bought a house in England with the intention of spending more time in Britain. His manager Darryl McKerrow was killed in a hunting accident during the 1984–85 season, and Thorburn was subsequently managed by Robert Windsor, until joining Barry Hearn&#x27;s Matchroom Sport in January 1988. Thorburn was made a Member of the Order of Canada in 1984. He was added to the BC Sports Hall of Fame in 1995, and inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

His instruction book, &quot;Cliff Thorburn&#x27;s Snooker Skills&quot;, was published in 1987 by Hamlyn, and his autobiography, &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;, co-written with Everton, was published by Partridge Press in the same year. Thorburn is the head coach for cue sports at the Canadian Billiards and Snooker Association, director of coaching and an ambassador for the Pan American Billiards &amp; Snooker Association, and a member of the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association International Expert Coaching Advisory Panel.

<text>Esteban Arce (born c. 1962) is a Mexican television entertainer.

==Early life==
He was born in Mexico City and lived with 2 brothers and 2 sisters named José Luís, Eduardo, Alejandra, and Adriana in a little house in delegación Benito Juarez. He loved soccer and to his day he is a big fan of Atlante F.C. (Mexican soccer team for which he played for in the reserves.)

==Career==
His first program was in radio in Telehit, then his first program in television was El Calabozo Later he moved to Miami to be a writer for Univision. He returned to Mexico. He worked for a while in Trapitos al Sol. He moved again to Miami for four years. He worked in Cotorreando and in the second of July in 2007 he appeared in Matutino Express for the first time. His show is about making fun of news. He is every week 1st or 2nd in the morning ratings. His program is from 7 to 10 A.M. on Canal Cuatro (channel 4). In a few months his show will appear on Galavision in the U.S. He has 3 children named Esteban who is 14 years old, Maria José who is 5 years old, and Marene who is 9 years old. He is married with Nieves Sanisteban.

Arce was the third addition to the Telemundo tabloid show, after his program Calabozo, &quot;Cotorreando&quot;. He is known for his jokes, and his apparently amicable, on camera feud with co-host Mauricio Zeilic (the show has four co-hosts). Arce has been reprimanded on camera a few times by show producers for some comments that he has made. Public opinion about him is split: Although many see him as a host with good sense of humor, others consider his comments to be disrespectful. Because the majority of the public seems to like his humor.
Arce does not discriminate when it comes to joking about entertainers: Some of his favorite targets seem to include Mexican superstars such as María Félix, Luis Miguel and Irma Serrano, but he has also made jokes about Julio Sabala, Madonna, Michael Jackson and Marc Anthony, among others.

Arce worked as an interviewer during Telemundo&#x27;s airing of the 2004 &quot;Premios Billboard Latinos&quot;, where he interviewed, among others, David Bisbal and Ricky Martin. He told Martin in Spanish that &quot;The only way I can get women is by hanging out with you!&quot;. In January 2007 he signed a contract with Televisa and his new program Matutino Express is one of the most successful shows in the country. It is a show with news comedy and Esteban&#x27;s ongoing humor that mixes up topics and makes fun of his co-workers. Arce also appeared as himself in the episode &quot;La Casa del Millón&quot; of the comedy series, &quot;Una familia de diez&quot;.

He now works in Mexico in Matutino Express.

==Controversy over homosexuality views and homophobic comments==
After a video of the December 18, 2009 &quot;Matutino Express&quot; was posted online and virally distributed in January 2010, controversy spread about the Arce&#x27;s question and comments around sexual orientations vs sexual behavior, during the program Arce asked whether homosexual orientation was &quot;normal&quot; to the program&#x27;s recurrent (sexologist Elsy Reyes) quite repeatedly since the sexologist failed to provide a straight answer to whether it was or not; during the exchange Elsy said that among some mammals homosexuality was a known behavior to which Arce replied that indeed the behavior exists although is considered &quot;animal dementia&quot;. The most active media of discussion was Twitter, where a trend topic #Estebanarcefueradelaire (Spanish for &quot;[take] Esteban Arce off air&quot;) was started and got full of petitions directed to Emilio Azcárraga Jean, president of Televisa, to replace Arce as host of Matutino Express. A video showing the debate with Reyes was posted on YouTube and distributed on other social networks like Facebook, where other groups have also criticized Arce.
Esteban has been known for other homophobic comments on radio and TV shows over time making him the target of multiple critiques.

<doc id="626672" wikidata="Q269462" url="?curid=626672" title="Paula Cole">
<text>Paula Dorothy Cole (born April 5, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter and producer. After gaining attention for her performances as a vocalist on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1993–1994 Secret World Tour, she released her first album, &quot;Harbinger&quot;, which suffered from a lack of promotion when the label, Imago Records, folded shortly after its release. Her second album, &quot;This Fire&quot; (1996), brought her worldwide acclaim, peaking at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and producing two hit singles, the triple-Grammy nominated &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot;, which reached the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1997, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot;, which was used as the theme song of the television show &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Cole was a featured performer in the 1996 prototype mini-tour for Lilith Fair, and also was a headliner for Lilith Fair in 1997 and 1998. She won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1998, and also became the first woman ever to be nominated for &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; in her own right in that same year.

Her third album, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Amen&quot;, marked a major stylistic departure for Cole, and this alienated many of her former fans; the album sales were disappointing compared to the multi-Platinum sales of her prior effort. She has since released several more albums, including the jazz-influenced &quot;Courage&quot; (2007) and &quot;Ithaca&quot; (2010), which marked a return to her 1990s folk-rock sound. Her most recent release was titled &quot;American Quilt&quot;, and came out in May 2021. Cole&#x27;s music sometimes addresses social issues, such as gender stereotypes, environmental issues, the history of slavery in the United States, and the Iraq war. Besides recording and performing, Cole has also served on the faculty at Berklee College of Music since 2013.

==Early life==
Cole was raised in Rockport, Massachusetts. Her mother, Stephanie Cole, a mixed media artist, was an elementary school art teacher; her father, Jim Cole, was a professor of biology and ecology at Salem State College and played bass in the polka band &quot;Johnny Prytko and the Connecticut Hi-Tones&quot;. Her older sister Irene played piano. She has stated she has Irish, Italian and Polish ancestry.

She attended Rockport High School where she was president of her senior class and performed in school theatrical productions such as &quot;South Pacific&quot;. Cole then attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, where she studied jazz singing and improvisation with Bob Stoloff. She sang jazz standards at lounges and nightclubs. One of the school projects was with Vox One, a chorus group at Berklee that later turned to pro as well. She was offered a record deal by the jazz label GRP Records, but decided to turn it down.

After graduating Berklee, she moved to San Francisco and began working on song ideas. She lived with three roommates and ate meagerly, building up her home studio and writing down song ideas including one that later became &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot; Impressing label president Terry Ellis with her demo performances, she signed with his Imago Records in 1992, and was coached by veteran artist&#x27;s manager John Carter on the album project that would become &quot;Harbinger&quot;.

==Career==
===1993–1998: &quot;Harbinger&quot; and &quot;This Fire&quot;===

Cole got her first big professional break when she was invited to perform on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1993–94 Secret World Tour. To replace Sinéad O&#x27;Connor who left the tour, Gabriel sought Cole on the recommendation of his studio engineer Kevin Killen. Gabriel left an answering machine message for her at her apartment in San Francisco, and she immediately flew to Mannheim, Germany, for her only rehearsal with Gabriel, shortly before performing in front of 16,000 people.

Cole joined the two last legs of Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1993–94 Secret World tour. A video of the concert was shot just days after Cole joined the tour. The video was released as &quot;Secret World Live&quot;, with Cole covering all the primary female vocals and featured in duets with Gabriel, especially the songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot; on which she sang the part that Kate Bush recorded with Gabriel in 1986, and &quot;Blood of Eden&quot; recorded by Gabriel and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor in 1992. The film received the 1996 Grammy Award for Best Long Form Music Video. Cole was also the main female vocalist on &quot;Secret World Live&quot;, the audio album documenting the tour. The tour gave Cole international exposure as well as experience performing on a large stage. Her performance earned high praise: in a retrospective review, PopMatters wrote that Cole was &quot;one of the real stars&quot; on the tour, that she easily handled Kate Bush&#x27;s parts, and that she was &quot;maybe a superior vocalist&quot; to Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

Shortly after the tour, Cole released her first album &quot;Harbinger&quot; in 1994. She appeared with Melissa Etheridge to sing a duet on VH1. Imago Records went out of business a few months after the album came out. In 1995, Cole signed on to Warner Bros. Records. Warner reissued &quot;Harbinger&quot; in the autumn of 1995.

&quot;Harbinger&quot; featured songs dwelling on Cole&#x27;s personal thoughts on discrimination and unhappiness. The songs were musically lush but driven and bleak. The accompanying artwork featured photographs of Cole with a boyishly short haircut, wearing loose fitting black sweatclothes, combat boots and nose ring. Imago Records folded and promotion of &quot;Harbinger&quot; was limited, affecting its sales. A single, &quot;I Am So Ordinary&quot;, was released with a black-and-white video that reflected the album&#x27;s artwork.

In late 1996, Cole released her second album on Warner, &quot;This Fire&quot;, which was entirely self-produced. The album&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot;, went to No. 8 on &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s pop chart. The follow-up single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot; reached No. 11, its popularity bolstered by its use as the theme song for the hit teen drama series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; which debuted over a year after the album. The single &quot;Me&quot; (No. 35 Airplay chart) was also released as a radio-only single. The title &quot;Hush, Hush, Hush&quot;, a duet with Peter Gabriel, talks about AIDS and about a young man dying in his father&#x27;s comforting arms. &quot;Feelin&#x27; Love&quot; was a single that was included on the soundtrack to &quot;City of Angels&quot;.

In 1996, Cole, along with Sarah McLachlan, Suzanne Vega, Lisa Loeb and others, was a featured performer in a four show mini-tour that served as a prototype for what would become the Lilith Fair tour. She was also a headliner for the Lilith Fair tours in 1997 and 1998. She was nominated for several Grammy Awards in 1997. Among them was &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; (Cole was the third woman to ever be nominated in this category after Janet Jackson in 1990 and Mariah Carey in 1992, but the first as a solo nomination); she did not win, but she did go on to win &quot;Best New Artist&quot; that same year.

===1999–2006: &quot;Amen&quot;, hiatus, and motherhood===
In 1999 Cole released &quot;Amen&quot; with the newly formed Paula Cole Band. The album&#x27;s debut single &quot;I Believe in Love&quot; was initially not a success but was remixed by producer Jonathan Peters into a successful dance song. The song &quot;Be Somebody&quot; was featured and performed by Paula and the band at P3 on the hit TV show &quot;Charmed&quot; in 2000. The album which had guest appearances by DJ Premier and long-time Cole fan Tionne Watkins featured some R&amp;B and hip-hop influences but failed to match the success of &quot;This Fire&quot;. 

During this time Cole took a hiatus to raise her daughter, Sky.

A fourth album was recorded with Hugh Padgham but the label refused to release it; in 2005 Cole uploaded one of the tracks, &quot;Singing Out My Life&quot;, to her own website to get her sound heard. She also recorded a song called &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; during these sessions, which can be heard in Mercury automobile commercials. Cole also made a home recording of a song protesting President Bush and the Iraq War titled &quot;My Hero, Mr. President!&quot;, which she posted on her website.

===2007–2013: &quot;Courage&quot;, &quot;Ithaca&quot;, and &quot;Raven&quot;===
Cole returned in June 2007 with her fourth studio album, &quot;Courage&quot;, which was released on Decca Records and produced by Bobby Colomby at Capitol Studios in Hollywood.

Cole&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Ithaca&quot;, was released September 21, 2010. She wrote and co-produced all of the songs on the album. Cole says it &quot;represents that inner fortitude and the journey I&#x27;ve been on.&quot;

&quot;Raven&quot;, Cole&#x27;s sixth studio album, was funded by a Kickstarter campaign which ran from September 22 to October 29, 2012, and raised $75,258. The album was released on April 23, 2013, on her 675 label. Cole wrote the 11 songs on the album including two from early in her career, &quot;Imaginary Man&quot; and &quot;Manitoba&quot;. Her mother had saved these songs on cassette tapes. Most of the album was recorded in one week at a barn in Massachusetts. The musicians included co-producer/drummer Ben Wittman, guitarist Kevin Barry and bassist Tony Levin. She has worked with Wittman and Barry since she was 19.

===2014–2018: &quot;7&quot;, &quot;This Bright Red Feeling&quot;, and &quot;Ballads&quot;===
&quot;7&quot; is Cole&#x27;s seventh studio album, released on March 23, 2015, via Cole&#x27;s website and to other digital music outlets on April 10, 2015. In Cole&#x27;s words, it is &quot;a collection of songs that came suddenly and urgently. The songs demanded to be written and released, as if my subconscious needed to reach out to me; to tell me what it thought about all I was going through. I recorded this album live, as an acoustic quartet. It sounds like a soft, soulful album made in the 1960s and the songs speak for themselves.&quot;

Cole announced that she was selling her new live album &quot;This Bright Red Feeling&quot; exclusively on CD at live shows and at her website, with intentions to put it online for digital sale soon. The album is a recording of her live New York City show on May 1, 2016, but also includes re-recordings of two of her biggest commercial hits. The album&#x27;s title comes from a lyric from her song &quot;Tiger&quot;.

Cole announced a new Kickstarter project on June 16, 2016, for a covers studio album, &quot;Ballads&quot;. It raised $76,899. The album was released on August 11, 2017. The first single, a cover of Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;, was released on June 1. The album hit #9 on the Billboard Traditional Jazz Album Chart. 

===2019–2021: &quot;Revolution&quot;, &quot;American Quilt&quot;===
Paula Cole released her ninth studio album, &quot;Revolution&quot;, on September 13, 2019, on 675 Records.

In 2021, Cole released the album &quot;American Quilt&quot;.

===Social commentary===
Cole said her 1996 song &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot; was intended as a commentary on gender stereotypes, but the feminist message was misinterpreted by many listeners who did not realize the song was intended to be satirical. In 2003, Cole recorded a song called &quot;My Hero, Mr. President&quot; that she released for free download, which was critical of President George W. Bush and America&#x27;s involvement in the Iraq War. Robert Morast of the &quot;Argus Leader&quot; reported that Cole was the first &quot;bona fide mainstream musician&quot; to take a public stance against the Iraq war.
On her 2019 album &quot;Revolution&quot;, Cole covered a version of the Marvin Gaye song Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology) which she said was about &quot;planetary health&quot;. Cole told Billboard Magazine that while love songs matter, there should also be songs about important societal issues. Cole&#x27;s song &quot;Silent&quot;, also on the album Revolution, is about her experience of being sexually assaulted early in her career and her refusal to continue to be silent about the experience. In May 2021, Cole told USA Today that her song &quot;Hidden in Plain Sight&quot; addressed the &quot;shameful history of slavery.&quot;

==Other activities==
Cole performed a two-hour set at Berklee Performance Center in Boston, Massachusetts on February 16, 2007, during which she debuted several songs from her upcoming fourth studio album, &quot;Courage&quot;. The set began with a solo piano version of &quot;Where Have All the Cowboys Gone?&quot;, which was replayed by the full band toward the end of the concert. Her performance was reviewed favorably in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; on February 19, 2007. In March 2007, her official MySpace page previewed three new songs from &quot;Courage&quot;: &quot;Comin&#x27; Down&quot;, &quot;El Greco&quot;, and the album&#x27;s first single, entitled &quot;14&quot;.

Cole is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism, and worked with them on a radio public service announcement.

On July 10, 2007, Cole sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch of the 2007 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. In August 2007, Cole toured with Mandy Moore, playing mid-size venues in the western United States.

On June 17, 2008, she sang &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; at Game 6 of the NBA Finals in Boston. In August 2008 and 2009, Cole continued to tour and promote her CD &quot;Courage&quot;.

Since 2013, Cole has been on the voice faculty at Berklee College of Music while continuing an active performing career.

In 2024, Cole competed in season twelve of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Ship&quot; where she briefly rode a ship-like vehicle in the first appearance and had Jewel (who won season six as &quot;Queen of Hearts&quot;) as her Mask Ambassador. She was eliminated in the Group A finals alongside Marsai Martin as &quot;Woodpecker&quot; and did an encore of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Wait&quot;.

==Personal life==
In June 2002, Cole married Moroccan musician Hassan Hakmoun, whom she had met on the Secret World Tour in 1994. The couple divorced in 2007. They have one daughter, Sky, born in 2001. Cole is openly bisexual and came out in 2022.

<text>Bank of America Stadium is a 74,867-seat multi-purpose stadium located on in the Uptown section of Charlotte, North Carolina, United States. It is the home facility and headquarters of the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL) and Charlotte FC of Major League Soccer (MLS). The stadium opened in 1996 as Ericsson Stadium, with Swedish telecom company LM Ericsson initially holding the naming rights. In 2004, Charlotte-based financial services company Bank of America purchased the naming rights under a 20-25-year agreement at $140 million. Former Panthers president Danny Morrison called it a &quot;classic American stadium&quot; due to its bowl design and other features.

In addition to the Panthers and CLTFC, the stadium hosts the annual Duke&#x27;s Mayo Bowl, which features teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and either the Southeastern Conference (SEC) or the Big Ten Conference. The stadium was planned to host the annual ACC Championship Game through at least 2019; the game was moved in 2016 but reinstated in 2017. The ACC announced on May 19, 2022, that Bank of America Stadium would continue to host the championship through at least the 2030 season. The largest crowd to ever attend a football game at the stadium was on September 9, 2018, when 74,532 people watched the Panthers defeat the Dallas Cowboys 16–8.

==Sites considered for selection==
The Panthers organization considered several possible sites for the stadium&#x27;s location before choosing the Charlotte center city site. Part of the site was occupied by the historic Good Samaritan Hospital. As part of the preparation for the 2019 Equal Justice Initiative Community Remembrance Project, Charlotte historian Michael Moore determined the site was also significant as the location of the city&#x27;s first known lynching in 1913.

One alternative was near NASCAR&#x27;s Charlotte Motor Speedway and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in northeast Mecklenburg County. Another was at the intersection of I-85 and US 74 in western Gaston County. A popular option was to locate the facility near Carowinds amusement park, with the 50 yard line being on the state border of North Carolina and South Carolina.

==Naming rights==
The stadium was originally known as Carolinas Stadium, a name which remains in use for certain events such as FIFA matches. It opened on August 3, 1996, as Ericsson Stadium after Swedish telecom company LM Ericsson purchased the naming rights in a ten-year, $25 million agreement. In 2004, the stadium received its current name after Bank of America purchased the naming rights for 20 years. Since then, many fans now refer to the stadium as &quot;BOA&quot;, &quot;The Bank&quot;, or &quot;PoundTown&quot;.

==Stadium features==
Bank of America Stadium has many unique external features. Aspects of the stadium&#x27;s architecture, such as the three huge main entrances, incorporate the team&#x27;s colors of black, process blue and silver. Arches that connect column supports on the upper deck resemble the shape of half a football, while several acres of numerous trees and landscaping surround the building. The stadium&#x27;s architecture and design has been compared to that of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum and Soldier Field, among others. It has also received mentions for externally resembling &quot;a fortress&quot; instead of a stadium.

Each of the stadium&#x27;s entrances are flanked on both sides by two larger-than-life bronze panther statues, something unique throughout the entire NFL. These six statues are all named &quot;Indomitable Spirit&quot; and were installed in 1996. Each one depicts a crouching, snarling panther with green eyes; they are the largest sculptures ever commissioned in the United States. The names of the team&#x27;s original PSL owners are engraved into each statue&#x27;s base.

The stadium also has six light domes. These are found on top of the main entrances, two per entrance, and sit over a hundred feet in the air. Originally, they simply glowed the Panthers&#x27; unique &#x27;process blue&#x27; every night. As the seasons wore on, the emitted light became less and less impressive and the domes started showing their age. During the 2014 renovations, the domes were rebuilt with LED systems which allow them to project process blue in various ways not possible with the original technology.

Additionally, two people in the Panthers Hall of Honor, former team executive Mike McCormack and former Panthers linebacker and assistant coach Sam Mills, are honored with life-sized bronze statues outside the stadium. Before the 2014 renovations, the names of the hall of honor inductees were placed where the upper ribbon board now resides. These names were subsequently repainted onto the top rear wall behind the last row of seats, then replaced by signs in 2019. Three marble copies of a quote about the stadium from team founder Jerry Richardson were placed near the stadium&#x27;s entrances in 2014. Due to renovations, these quotes were later displayed in the lower concourse entrances. They are also engraved on benches outside the stadium.

In 2016, a statue of Richardson was added in front of the stadium&#x27;s north gate in celebration of his 80th birthday. The statue stands nearly tall and features larger than life sculptures of Richardson flanked on both sides by two panthers. One panther stands on its hind legs, claws bared, while the other crouches. All three sculptures have the same bronze color and both panthers have the green eyes of and physically resemble the &quot;Indomitable Spirit&quot; statues. In June 2020, the statue was removed, with the team citing potential safety concerns due to protests going on at the time.

==Carolina Panthers==

In addition to hosting every Panthers home game since 1996, Bank of America Stadium has hosted seven playoff games. Carolina has also had over 150 consecutive sellouts at the stadium starting with the 2002 season.

===Inaugural season===
The Panthers played their inaugural season at Clemson University&#x27;s Memorial Stadium while the stadium was being constructed. On August 3, 1996, the stadium played host to its first professional football game as the Panthers took on the Chicago Bears during the preseason. The inaugural kickoff was at 7:35 pm. Carolina won 30–12. The stadium&#x27;s first regular season game took place on September 1, 1996, against Carolina&#x27;s to-be division rival Atlanta; the Panthers won 29–6.

===Playoff games===

In 1996, on their way to their first NFC Championship Game, Carolina defeated the then-defending Super Bowl Champion Dallas Cowboys in the first playoff game the stadium hosted. Again they defeated the Cowboys on their way to Super Bowl XXXVIII in Houston in 2004. Carolina was handed their first ever home playoff loss, 33–13, by the Arizona Cardinals on January 10, 2009, in the divisional round. The Panthers suffered a second home playoff loss against the San Francisco 49ers 23–10 on January 12, 2014, in the same round. En route to their fourth NFC Championship game appearance, the Panthers beat the Seattle Seahawks 31–24 in the divisional round on January 17, 2016. The Panthers defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship game for their second NFC Championship in franchise history on January 24, 2016. This marked the first NFC Championship played and won at the stadium.

===Notable weather events===
Since it is an open-air stadium, Bank of America Stadium has been subject to a number of events caused by extreme weather.
*In 2011, a rainstorm blanketed the stadium towards the end of the second quarter and caused severe flooding. Four-plus inches of rain fell in under an hour. &quot;Charlotte Magazine&quot; later termed the game as the &quot; &#x27;11 Water Bowl&quot;. Carolina won 16–10.
* On December 24, 2022, the temperature was at kickoff, making it the coldest home game in Panthers history.

==Impact on NFL venues==
At the time of its construction in the mid-1990s, the stadium was a pioneering project for the use of Personal Seat Licenses. It was the first large-scale project funded in the United States chiefly through securing PSLs, which were a new idea themselves. The strength of PSL pledges impressed NFL owners and helped result in the Carolinas receiving the first NFL expansion team in nearly two decades.

The Seattle Seahawks used the stadium, among others, as a reference when designing CenturyLink Field. By 2013, the number of new or renovated stadiums since Bank of America Stadium opened had risen to 25.

==Stadium renovations==

During its first few seasons the stadium was considered so far ahead of its time that until the 2013–14 offseason it only underwent minor improvements (aside from seating additions). The most notable of these improvements came in 2007 when the original scoreboards, video boards and displays from 1996 were replaced with 31.5&#x27; x 77&#x27; Diamond Vision video boards. Four ribbon boards were also installed: two spanning the length of the field on either side and two in opposing corners.

In the following years the stadium still wasn&#x27;t considered as up-to-date as other NFL stadiums. Several reasons existed, including the lack of a surround sound system, smaller video boards compared to the rest of the league and poor cellular reception, among others. During the 2013 offseason, the Panthers renovated the home locker room. It now contained 74 lockers compared to 66 previously, the interior became more clean and modern, and the team&#x27;s then-new logo was added throughout.

The Panthers proposed a $250 million stadium renovation project in early 2013, pending a vote by the city of Charlotte to help pay for it. This plan included two sets of new scoreboards, multiple escalators, infrastructure and concourse improvements, among others. The subsequent vote by the city failed and efforts to get any money from the State of North Carolina failed as well. However, in April 2013 the Charlotte city council agreed to an $87.5 million deal for the renovations. This deal also kept the Panthers in Charlotte until at least 2019. Despite the lower cost, the renovations would stay true to the team&#x27;s original plans.

===2014–2017 renovation===
====2014====
In January 2014, the Panthers began the most significant renovations to the stadium in its 18-year history as part one of a multi-year renovation plan. The upgrades, completed by the start of the 2014–2015 NFL season, included numerous enhancements. First and perhaps most striking of all, two 200&#x27; x 56&#x27; HD video boards (over twice the size of their predecessors), and two 360° ribbon boards from Daktronics replaced the previous scoreboards/ribbon boards. The new ribbon boards were the tallest in the NFL and the video boards were among the top ten largest in the NFL when installed. Secondly, escalators were installed for the upper deck, making access easier for fans. These warranted extensions to the building itself which retained the stadium&#x27;s original external designs. A new surround sound system was also included, with speakers placed around the perimeter of the bowl doubling as flagpoles. In addition, four covered open-air sections on the upper deck called &quot;fan plazas&quot; were added. Finally, LED-enhanced glass domes were installed along with new external signage above the main entrances.

====2015====
Prior to the start of the 2015 season, the Panthers renovated all 158 existing luxury suites to the stadium and added a new private club suite, dubbed &quot;The 32 Club&quot; due to its position at the 32-yard line. The team later announced another new club, dubbed the &quot;51 Club&quot; in honor of former player and coach Sam Mills, would also be added. These new installations decreased the stadium&#x27;s number of luxury suites to 153, but increased overall seating capacity. The team also added two small ribbon boards above each tunnel entrance which are visible from the stands.

====2016====
Part three of the renovations included upgrading the upper-level concourse with buffet-style drink stations and installing double the amount of wi-fi access points than before. Updated signage reflecting the team&#x27;s current logos and word mark was added to the upper concourse, as well as improved concession stands and new drink concessions. Most notably, almost 100 full-body scanners replaced the traditional &quot;pat-downs&quot; at the main entrances and a new security office was added, as well as other security improvements.

In addition, a 13-foot statue of Jerry Richardson flanked by two life-sized panthers was erected in front of the stadium as a gift to then-team owner Jerry Richardson. Since June 2020, the statue has since been removed and stored in an undisclosed location in light of the George Floyd protests.

====2017====
The fourth and final major renovation included updating the lower-level concourse by adding new signage, refurbishing concessions and installing updated televisions in the club levels. Banners depicting significant moments throughout Panthers history were also added to the concourse. The seating capacity was slightly increased thanks to upgrades at the club level. A new field and drainage system were additionally installed.

===Other renovations===
In 2019, Lowe&#x27;s signage was added onto the stadium&#x27;s East Gate, as well as two Panthers posters. The scoreboards received a minor change with the Panthers signage on the bottom of each board replaced with various sponsor logos. The members in the Panthers&#x27; Hall of Honor were also given new nameplates on the rear wall of the upper deck. The next year, 2020, the team announced the removal of almost 1000 seats in the west end zone. This was to replace the seats with 14 &quot;bunker suites&quot; at field level. Construction was finished by the start of the 2020 season.

====MLS renovation====
When Charlotte was awarded the 30th Major League Soccer franchise, Charlotte FC, in 2019, it was announced the team would play at Bank of America Stadium. Despite the stadium having the proper field size for soccer, the stadium was not originally designed to accommodate a soccer team full-time. Renovations include new locker rooms, camera positions, a tunnel entrance, an over 200-foot curved video screen outside of the east gate, and lower concourse upgrades. The renovations were completed before Charlotte FC&#x27;s first season in 2022. In March 2021, it was announced the stadium would have a FieldTurf surface starting with the 2021 NFL season, replacing Bermuda grass that was used since the stadium&#x27;s inception.

==College and high school football==
===College football===

Bank of America Stadium does not serve as the primary home stadium for any college football team. However, starting in 1996, the stadium has hosted many college football games. These include games featuring teams from across North and South Carolina. 
* The ACC Championship Game, played on the first Saturday in December, pits the top two ACC teams (based on regular season records) against each other. Prior to 2024, the ACC Championship Game was played between the winner of the ACC&#x27;s Coastal Division and winner of the Atlantic Division; it had been held at the stadium from 2010 to 2015. In February 2014, the ACC announced a 6-year contract extension to keep the game in Charlotte through 2019, but pulled out in September 2016 after North Carolina passed the Public Facilities Privacy &amp; Security Act (HB2). The game was reinstated after HB2&#x27;s repeal in 2017.
* The Duke&#x27;s Mayo Bowl (previously known as the Continental Tire Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, and Belk Bowl), takes place in late December; it has been held annually in Charlotte since 2002. The game pits teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) against either the Southeastern Conference (SEC) or the Big Ten Conference.
* The Duke&#x27;s Mayo Classic (formerly the Belk Kickoff Game), has been held at the stadium since 2015. The first meeting was between North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2017, the Kickoff game featured NC State and South Carolina; in 2018 the game was played between West Virginia and Tennessee. In 2019, North and South Carolina played each other for the second time. The 2021 matchups were between East Carolina and Appalachian State, with the Mountaineers designated as the home team; and Clemson versus Georgia.
* The stadium has hosted several East Carolina Pirates games: in 1996, a 50–29 win versus the NC State Wolfpack, a 30–23 win in 1999 versus the West Virginia Mountaineers, a 52–14 loss in 2004 to NC State, a 27–22 upset win in 2008 over the 17th-ranked Virginia Tech Hokies, and a 56–37 loss in 2011 to 12th-ranked South Carolina.
* In October 2006, Clemson beat Temple 63–9 in a non-conference game at the stadium. The match-up was a Temple home game, but the school moved it to Charlotte for financial reasons.
* Two games in the North Carolina-NC State football rivalry took place at the stadium in 1998 and 1999. North Carolina won both by the scores of 37–34 and 10–6, respectively.
*North Carolina A&amp;T and North Carolina Central played each other at the stadium in 2022.
* Another game between North and South Carolina is scheduled to take place at the stadium in 2023.

===High school football===
On May 6, 2020, it was announced that Charlotte&#x27;s Myers Park High School would play against South Pointe High School from Rock Hill, South Carolina. The game was scheduled to take place on September 5, 2020, however, it was later cancelled.

The first high school game played at the stadium happened on August 19, 2023, when NC Powerhouse Providence Day School beat SC Powerhouse Northwestern High School 42–35, in the inaugural Keep Pounding High School Classic.

==Soccer==
When Bank of America Stadium was designed, the field was made to meet the requirements for a soccer pitch. This ability would not be used for much of the stadium&#x27;s first two decades in operation. With Charlotte FC&#x27;s arrival, the stadium now plays regular host to MLS and international soccer matches.

===Charlotte FC===

Major League Soccer awarded an expansion team to Charlotte that started play in 2022 as Charlotte FC at Bank of America Stadium, following renovations. The stadium saw its first MLS-related action when it played host to matches between Charlotte FC&#x27;s and Atlanta United&#x27;s academy teams on October 31, 2020. The team made their home debut on March 5, 2022, in front of 74,479 spectators, setting a new MLS record for stand-alone match attendance. Most Charlotte FC matches only use the lower bowl and club level, capping capacity at 38,000.

===Other soccer matches===
Before Charlotte FC&#x27;s arrival, Bank of America Stadium was no stranger to hosting soccer matches. The stadium hosted the NCAA Men&#x27;s Soccer Championship in 1999 and 2000. Despite this, it took until 2010 for soccer matches to become a regular occurrence. Most matches since then have featured international teams. The International Champions Cup stages annual international club friendlies at the stadium as part of a long-term contract with Relevent Sports Group. Among the clubs who have played at the stadium include clubs from the Premier League, Bundesliga and various national teams.

===International and club friendly matches===

==Concerts==
Concerts at the stadium were a rarity for many years. Most acts performed at the Spectrum Center or at other performing venues in Charlotte. After David Tepper bought the Panthers (and therefore the stadium) in 2018, concerts became more commonplace.

==Other events==
* A four-day Billy Graham crusade was held at the stadium in 1996.
* The closing night of the 2012 Democratic National Convention, in which President Barack Obama was expected to deliver his acceptance speech for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, was to be held at the stadium on September 6, 2012. However, due to predicted thunderstorms, it was relocated to Spectrum Center.
* The stadium hosted the inaugural Untappd Beer Festival on May 4, 2019. It was going to host the second festival on May 16, 2020, however, the festival was postponed due to COVID-19.
* The 14th annual Beer, Bourbon and BBQ Festival was hosted by the stadium on March 7, 2020.
* The stadium served as a COVID-19 vaccination site from January 29–31 and March 9–11, 2021.
* Bank of America Stadium hosted the Topgolf Live Stadium Series from March 25–28, 2021.

==Future==
Although no time frame has been given, Panthers and Charlotte FC owner David Tepper has expressed interest in constructing a new stadium for the teams in Uptown Charlotte, with Bank of America Stadium eventually being demolished. Tepper noted in 2019 that while the Stadium was well-preserved and well-landscaped, the growing maintenance expense after decades of use led him to joke that it would be cheaper to give the stadium away. Although the stadium&#x27;s design was ahead of its time, it&#x27;s now considered obsolete as the design lacks open concourses (allowing fans to stand and watch games from bars and other group areas) and a retractable roof. And while Bank of America Stadium was designed mostly for football under then-owner Jerry Richardson, Tepper has preferred that its replacement be multipurpose with a retractable roof in order to accommodate his MLS soccer team, concerts, major conventions, and NCAA Final Four basketball. In 2022, Tepper said another major renovation was under consideration. This renovation would apparently give the stadium two or three more decades of use.

Plans also include creating an entertainment district between the future stadium and the future Gateway Station, an $800 million intermodal transit station currently under construction.

In June 2024, the Panthers unveiled plans for an over $800 million renovation to the stadium. Upgrades would include new exterior video displays, seating, lighting, new concourses, and numerous other improvements. Construction is expected to start in 2026 with completion expected by 2029.

<text>HMS &quot;Barrosa&quot; (D68) was a later or 1943 fleet destroyer of the Royal Navy.

==Design and construction==
The Battle-class was developed as a result of operational experience in the early years of the Second World War, which had shown that the Royal Navy&#x27;s existing destroyers had inadequate anti-aircraft protection, and in particular, lacked a modern dual-purpose main gun armament, capable of dealing with both surface targets and air attack, with guns lacking the high elevation mountings necessary to deal with dive bombers. The resulting design was armed with two twin 4.5 inch high-angle gun-turrets of a new design mounted forward and a heavy close-in anti-aircraft armament, with 16 Battle-class destroyers ordered under the 1942 construction programme.

For the 1943 construction programme, 24 Battle-class destroyers of a revised design (known as &quot;1943 Battles&quot;) were ordered, with four destroyers (&quot;Barrosa&quot;, , &quot;Talavera&quot; and &quot;Trincomalee&quot;) to be built by the Scottish shipbuilder, John Brown &amp; Company.

&quot;Barrosa&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of normal and at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of ( at full load. of fuel oil was carried, giving an endurance of at .

Two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark IV gun mounts, capable of elevating to 85 degrees, were mounted forward, while a single 4.5 inch gun, elevating to 55 degrees was fitted behind the funnel - this fifth gun, which could fire astern, replaced a 4-inch gun fitted to the 1942 Battles used for firing Star shell and could be controlled by the main fire control system. Close-in anti-aircraft armament was eight Bofors 40 mm gun, with two twin stabilised STAAG mounts, with integrated fire control, aft, one simple Mark V twin mount amidships, and two single mounts on the bridge wings. Two quintuple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo-tubes were fitted, with a Squid anti-submarine mortar aft.

&quot;Barrosa&quot;, named after the Battle of Barrosa, which took place in 1811 between British-Allied forces and France, and which ended in a French defeat. was one of six 1943 Battles ordered on 10 March 1943. The destroyer was laid down by John Brown at their Clydebank shipyard as Yard number 615 on 28 December 1943, launched on 17 January 1945 and completed on 14 February 1947.

==Operations==
On commissioning, &quot;Barrosa&quot; joined the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Home Fleet, but later in the year, a manpower shortage caused most of the Flotilla, including &quot;Barrosa&quot; to be laid up in reserve. &quot;Barrosa&quot; returned to active duties with the 4th Flotilla in 1948. On 12 November 1949, &quot;Barrosa&quot; collided with the oiler , damaging some of the destroyer&#x27;s portholes and causing a small split in her hull. In April 1950, &quot;Barrosa&quot; was placed in Reserve, as part of a wider transfer of destroyers to reserve with Loch-class frigates being returned to active service to improve the Royal Navy&#x27;s anti-submarine capability.

On 2 May 1952, &quot;Barrosa&quot; recommissioned into the 4th Destroyer Squadron, manned by the crew of , which went into reserve on the same day. In June 1953, &quot;Barrosa&quot; took part in the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead in honour of the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II. &quot;Barrosa&quot; was positioned in the middle of her sister ships and . &quot;Barrosa&quot; spent much of her time in the Mediterranean, duties including anti-arms smuggling patrols off Cyprus.

In November 1956 &quot;Barrosa&quot; formed part of the Royal Navy force deployed in the eastern Mediterranean during the Suez Crisis, as part of the 4th Destroyer Squadron.

==Refit and conversion to radar picket==
On 15 March 1959, &quot;Barrosa&quot; collided with her sister ship in the Bay of Biscay. Later that year, &quot;Barrosa&quot; entered an extensive programme of modification to become a radar picket, with the addition of the Sea Cat missile, as well as new anti-aircraft weaponry and new radar. In 1963 &quot;Barrosa&quot; joined the 8th Destroyer Squadron, based in the Far East, before joining the 26th Escort Squadron. As well as radar picket duties, tasks included operations against pirates, and on 10 February 1963, &quot;Barrosa&quot; intercepted a pirate boat, with a gun battle occurring between &quot;Barrosa&quot;″ s search party and the pirates, with one of the destroyer&#x27;s crew killed. The ship also carried out anti-infiltration patrols during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation.

In March 1967, at the start of her final commission, &quot;Barrosa&quot; was used in attempts to break up the oil spill from the supertanker &quot;Torrey Canyon&quot;, which had run aground off Cornwall, with detergent. In November 1967, she formed part of a naval task force deployed to cover the British Withdrawal from Aden. Other duties during this last commission included taking part in the Beira Patrol. On 2 October 1968, &quot;Barrosa&quot; took the Royal Fleet Auxiliary stores ship &quot;Lyness&quot; in tow after &quot;Lyness&quot;″ engine had broken down east of Shetland, stopping the supply ship from being driven onto rocks until power could be restored.

In December 1968 &quot;Barrosa&quot; was decommissioned and was listed for disposal in 1972. By 1974 &quot;Barrosa&quot; was being used as a storage hulk at Portsmouth. She arrived at Blyth in Northumberland for scrapping on 1 December 1978.

<text>The is a Shinto shrine located in Sakyō-ku, Kyoto, Japan. The Shrine is ranked as a (the top rank for shrines) by the Association of Shinto Shrines. It is listed as an important cultural property of Japan.

==History==

In 1895, a partial reproduction of the Heian Palace from Heian-kyō (the former name of Kyoto) was planned for construction for the 1100th anniversary of the establishment of Heian-kyō. The Industrial exposition fair (an exhibition of development of Japanese and foreign cultures) was held in Kyoto that year, where the replica was to be the main monument. However, failure to buy enough land where the Heian Palace used to stand, the building was built in Okazaki at 5/8 scale of the original. The &quot;Heian-jingū&quot; was built according to designs by Itō Chūta.

After the Exhibition ended, the building was kept as a shrine in memory of the 50th Emperor, Emperor Kanmu, who was the Emperor when Heian-kyō became the capital. In 1940, Emperor Kōmei was added to the list of dedication.

In 1976, part of the Shrine caught on fire, and nine of the buildings, including the honden, or main sanctuary, burned down. Three years later, the burned buildings were reconstructed with money collected from donations.

==Architecture==
The architecture design was a reproduction of the Chōdōin (Emperor&#x27;s palace in the former eras) in 5/8th scale (in length). The large red entrance gate is a reproduction of the Outenmon of the Chōdōin. The architecture of the main palace mirrors the style and features of the Kyoto Imperial Palace, the style from the 11th–12th century (late Heian Period). The Shrine&#x27;s torii is one of the largest in Japan.

==Garden==
The Japanese-style garden takes up about half the land area (approximately ). Renowned gardener Ogawa Jihei VII, also known as Ueji, created the garden over a 20-year period. The water used in the ponds comes from the Lake Biwa Canal. Species otherwise rare in Japan such as &quot;Acheilognathus cyanostigma&quot;, the Yellow pond turtle and the Japanese pond turtle live around the ponds. Visitors may feed the fish and turtles with food sold around the ponds.

==Festivals==
Annual festivals celebrate the memory of Emperor Kōmei (late January) and Emperor Kanmu (early April).

On October 22, &quot;Heian-jingū&quot; hosts the &quot;Jidai Matsuri&quot;, which is one of the most important festivals of Kyoto. The procession of this festival begins at the old Imperial palace, and includes carrying the &quot;mikoshi&quot; (portable shrines) of Emperors Kanmu and Kōmei to the Heian-jingū.

The Shrine is also used for traditional Japanese weddings as well as concerts. It is rare for a modern concert to be held at a historic site like the shrine, but merging modern and old culture in Kyoto has become a trend.

==Around the Shrine==
Adjacent to the Shrine is Okazaki Park, where visitors can learn about culture. The Shrine is surrounded by the Kyoto Prefectural Library, Kyoto Municipal Museum of Art, the National Museum of Modern Art, Kyoto, Kyoto Kaikan, and the Kyoto City Zoo.

==In media==
Parts of the 2003 film &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; were filmed there.

<doc id="626688" wikidata="Q2479200" url="?curid=626688" title="Cabinet of the Netherlands">
<text>The cabinet of the Netherlands () is the main executive body of the Netherlands. The current cabinet of the Netherlands is the Schoof cabinet, which has been in power since 2 July 2024. It is headed by Prime Minister Dick Schoof.

==Composition and role==
The cabinet consists of the ministers and state secretaries. The cabinet is led by the prime minister. There are between twelve and sixteen Ministers, most of whom are also heads of specific government ministries, although there are often some ministers without portfolio who have areas of responsibility inside one or more ministries. For instance there has for some time been a minister for development cooperation, who works within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Most ministries also have a state secretary who is responsible for part of the relevant portfolio. State secretaries (such as that of Trade and Development Cooperation) are given the right to call themselves &quot;Minister&quot; in other countries and be treated as such for protocolary purposes, while not having any of the domestic rights given specifically to Ministers. Most significantly, state secretaries are not members of the Council of Ministers.

The policy of a cabinet is coordinated by the Council of Ministers, in which all ministers, including ministers without portfolio, take part. The Council initiates laws and policy. State secretaries do not attend the Council of Ministers unless invited, and even then they have no voting rights in the Council. The Council meets every Friday in the Trêveszaal (the Room of Treaties) in the Binnenhof. Meetings are chaired by the Prime Minister, or an acting prime minister if necessary. The Council makes decisions in a collegial manner; all ministers, including the Prime Minister, are (theoretically) equal. Behind the closed doors of the Trêveszaal, ministers can freely debate proposed decisions and express their opinion on any aspect of cabinet policy. Once a decision is made by the Council, all individual members are bound by it and are obliged to support it publicly. A member of Cabinet who is not prepared to publicly support a decision of the Council is obliged to step down. Typically, a good deal of effort is put into reaching relative consensus on any decision. A process of voting within the Council does exist, but is hardly ever used.

Together with the King, the Council of Ministers forms the Government, which makes all the major decisions. In practice, the King does not participate in the daily decision-making of government, although he is kept up to date by weekly meetings with the Prime Minister. The Dutch constitution does not speak of cabinet, but instead only of the Council of Ministers and Government.

The ministers, individually and collectively (as cabinet), are responsible to the States-General for government policy and must enjoy its confidence. It is not possible for a minister to be a member of parliament. Ministers or state secretaries who are no longer supported by a parliamentary majority are also expected by convention to step down. In contrast to the Westminster system, Dutch ministers may not simultaneously also be members of the States-General, although members of the States-General can be appointed as ministers, whereupon their seats become vacant.

An important question is whether the relationship between the cabinet and parliament should be dualistic or monistic. That is, whether ministers and leaders of governing parliamentary parties should prepare important political decisions. According to the dualistic position, members of parliament of governing parties should function independently of the Cabinet. The monistic position, by contrast, is that the Cabinet plays an important role in proposing legislation and policy.

The Council of Ministers typically meets at least once a week and is presided by the Prime Minister.

==Formation==

After a general election held generally every four years, or if a cabinet resigns during a parliamentary term, the process of cabinet formation starts. Because of the multi-party system of the Netherlands, no single party has had a majority in parliament since 1900, and formation of a coalition of two or often three parties is always necessary. This is a time-consuming process. The entire procedure is regulated by tradition and convention, with only the final appointment process specified by law.

Since 2012, the House of Representative appoints a &quot;scout&quot; to explore which political parties are willing to form a cabinet together. In the subsequent information phase, negotiations will take place under the leadership of an informateur about the government&#x27;s future policy programme, to be recorded in a coalition agreement.. If negotiations break down, a new informateur is appointed and the information process begins afresh. If the informateur is successful, the portfolios are determined, divided among the parties and ministers and state secretaries are sought under the leadership of a formateur. The formateur is usually the prospective Prime Minister.

If the formateur is successful, the Monarch appoints all ministers and state secretaries individually by Royal Decision (&quot;Koninklijk Besluit&quot;). Each Minister privately swears an oath of loyalty to the Constitution. After this the entire Council of Ministers and the King or Queen &quot;regnant&quot; are photographed on the stairs of the palace Huis ten Bosch during the bordes scene. The new cabinet then presents their government statement to parliament.

Between the dissolution of the States-General before general elections and the appointment of a new cabinet, the incumbent cabinet is termed &quot;demissionair&quot;, that is, a caretaker government limiting itself to urgent and pressing matters and traditionally not taking any controversial decisions. If a Cabinet falls during a parliamentary term because one of the coalition partners withdraws its support, the coalition partner in question may leave. This does not result in a &quot;demissionair&quot; Cabinet, unless the Prime Minister is granted a dissolution of the States-General. Instead, the remaining parties in the governing coalition form a &quot;rompkabinet&quot; (&quot;rump cabinet&quot;). If the parties do not between them control a majority of the House of Representatives, the cabinet continues as a minority government.

==History==
The first real cabinet was formed in 1848 after a constitution was adopted which limited the power of the King and introduced the principle of ministerial responsibility to parliament. Until 1888 cabinets lacked a real coordinating role, and instead ministers were focused on their own department. After 1888 cabinets became more political.

Of the 32 coalition governments since World War II, only three excluded the largest party (all three times PvdA) and the largest number of parties in a coalition was 5 (in 1971 and 1973). After that, the three major Christian-democratic parties merged into CDA, and 2- or 3-party coalitions became standard.

Since 1945 there have been 32 cabinets, which were headed by 16 prime ministers. Willem Drees and Jan Peter Balkenende both chaired the most cabinets (four) and Ruud Lubbers served as prime minister the longest (between 1982 and 1994). The second Rutte cabinet was the longest lasting cabinet since World War II (1,816 days); only the cabinet led by Theo Heemskerk sat longer (2025 days). The first Balkenende cabinet is the shortest lasting normal cabinet since World War II (87 days); only the fifth cabinet of Hendrikus Colijn lasted shorter (10 days).




==Council of Ministers of the Kingdom==
The Cabinet of the Netherlands also takes responsibility for day-to-day affairs in the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which is distinct from the Netherlands, as it also includes the constituent countries of Aruba, Curaçao and Sint-Maarten. If affairs are decided which are of vital importance of the Kingdom as a whole, the Council of Ministers of the Netherlands is joined by a Minister Plenipotentiary for Aruba, Curaçao and Sint-Maarten to form the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom.

==Types==
There are different types of cabinets:
* A demissionary cabinet (&quot;demissionair kabinet&quot;) is a caretaker government during the election campaign and the formation of a new cabinet.
* An extra-parliamentary cabinet (&quot;extraparlementair kabinet&quot;) not based on a parliamentary majority. The last extra-parliamentary cabinet was the Den Uyl cabinet. It consisted of members of the three progressive parties (the social democratic PvdA, the social liberal D66, and the progressive Christian PPR) and progressive members from the Christian democratic ARP and KVP. It is contrasted with a parliamentary cabinet, which does have an explicit majority in parliament.
* A rump cabinet (&quot;rompkabinet&quot;) is the continuation of a Dutch cabinet when it has lost a coalition partner, typically a form of minority government, where the cabinet has not become demissionary, but seeks support from a majority of parliament to finish the work that was already introduced by the cabinet to the parliament. Normally the Dutch Monarch will call for dissolution of parliament somewhat later, since the basis behind the coalition agreement is gone.
* A broad-basis cabinet (&quot;brede basiskabinet&quot;) is an oversized coalition or national cabinet. Between 1945 and 1959, several cabinets have included more parties than were necessary for a parliamentary majority. The first of them was the Schermerhorn cabinet. Other parties were included to give the cabinet and its far-reaching proposals, like the formation of a welfare state, a broad basis in parliament and society. The core of these cabinets were formed by the social democratic PvdA and the catholic KVP, the Roman/Red alliance which by themselves had a large majority in parliament.

<doc id="626692" wikidata="Q1326889" url="?curid=626692" title="Star Fox (1993 video game)">
<text>Star Fox, known as Starwing in PAL regions, is a 1993 rail shooter game developed by Nintendo and Argonaut Software, and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The first entry in the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series, the story follows Fox McCloud and the rest of the Star Fox team defending their homeworld of Corneria against the invading forces of Andross.

&quot;Star Fox&quot; was the second 3D Nintendo game after &quot;X&quot; for the Game Boy in 1992, and the first Nintendo game to use polygonal graphics, achieved with the Super FX graphics chip included in the cartridge. The complex display of three-dimensional models with polygons was uncommon in console games.

&quot;Star Fox&quot; received critical acclaim and is often considered one of the greatest video games of all time. It sold more than 4 million copies and established the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series as a flagship Nintendo franchise. A sequel, &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, was developed, but was withheld from release until 2017, as a title for the Super NES Classic Edition. The next-released game in the series, &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, was a 1997 reboot for the Nintendo 64.

Nintendo re-released &quot;Star Fox&quot; worldwide for the first time in September 2017 as part of the Super NES Classic Edition. In September 2019, &quot;Star Fox&quot; was made available on the Nintendo Switch for subscribers of the Nintendo Switch Online service.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Star Fox&quot; is a rail shooter in a third-person and first-person 3D perspective. The player must navigate Fox&#x27;s spacecraft, an Arwing, through environments while various enemies (spaceships, robots, creatures, etc.) attack them. Along the way, various power-ups are placed in the stage to help the player. The player receives a score at the end of each level based on how many enemies have been destroyed and how well the player has defended their teammates. At the end of each level there is a boss that the player must defeat before progressing to the next level.

Control of the Arwing includes thrusters and retro-rockets on the Arwing allowing the player to temporarily speed up or slow down. These can be used to maneuver around enemy attacks and other obstacles. Damage is incurred incrementally via loss of shield energy before the destruction of the craft. The game also has a small degree of locational damage detection: if the ship&#x27;s wings clip against obstacles or the ground too much, they will break off, adversely affecting the craft&#x27;s handling and removing the ability to upgrade weapons.

The difficulty in &quot;Star Fox&quot; is also set in a unique way. Most scrolling shooters, if they have selectable difficulty levels, allow the player to set the difficulty by choosing an option (e.g. &quot;Easy&quot;, &quot;Normal&quot;, and &quot;Hard&quot;) at the beginning of the game. This option usually affects variables such as the number of lives a player has, the number of enemies encountered in the game, the speed of enemies, and so on. By contrast, at the beginning of &quot;Star Fox&quot;, the player is given a choice of one of three routes to take through the Lylat system. Each of these routes corresponds with a certain level of difficulty, but each route has its own series of unique levels. This gives &quot;Star Fox&quot; somewhat more replay value than other scrolling shooters that have a fixed series of levels each time the game is played. The three game paths all contain the planet Corneria (the first level) and Venom (the last level), but they each have different versions depending on the path taken.

In each level, the player is accompanied by three computer-controlled wingmen: Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad and Falco Lombardi. At certain pre-scripted points, one will fly into the player&#x27;s view, often either chasing an enemy or being chased and asking for assistance. Ignoring a wingman&#x27;s pleas will result in him taking damage, or even being shot down. They cannot be damaged by the player&#x27;s own lasers (although they will complain if hit). Regardless of their survival, wingmen are not present during boss battles but rejoin the player before the next stage. A player may choose to help their wingmen when they ask for assistance, as doing so will allow them to engage some of the enemies not destroyed by the player, helping the player to succeed and additionally making it easier to achieve maximum score in a given level. Additional points are also granted at the end of each level depending on the health of each wingman. If a wingman gets shot down, he will not return for the rest of the game.

==Plot==
This game takes place in a fictional planetary system called the Lylat system, which is inhabited by anthropomorphic animal species such as foxes, frogs, birds, rabbits, and apes. It contains the planets Corneria and Venom, representing good and evil, respectively. Andross, an evil scientist, has fled to the planet Venom after being banished from Corneria, and declared war on the latter, unleashing an enormous army to wreak havoc on the Lylat System. General Pepper, the commanding officer of Corneria&#x27;s defense force, dispatches a prototype high-performance fighter aircraft called the &quot;Arwing&quot;. However, lacking in time to train pilots for the new aircraft, he summons the elite mercenary team Star Fox to defeat Andross. Fox McCloud, the leader of the team, is accompanied by his teammates, Falco Lombardi, Peppy Hare, and Slippy Toad.

==Development and release==
Nintendo worked closely with Argonaut Software during the early years of the NES and Super NES. They developed a prototype on the NES, initially codenamed &quot;NESGlider&quot;, which was inspired by their earlier 8-bit game &quot;Starglider&quot;, and ported this prototype to the Super NES (the polygonal style used ended up having a strong resemblance to &quot;Starglider 2&quot;). Programmer Jez San told Nintendo that this was as good as it could get unless they were allowed to design custom hardware to make the Super NES better at processing 3D. Nintendo assented to this, and San hired chip designers to make the Super FX chip, the first 3D graphics accelerator in a consumer product. The Super FX was so much more powerful than the Super NES&#x27;s standard processor that the development team joked that the Super NES was just a box to hold the chip. Argonaut did much of the base programming for the game&#x27;s engine, while the character designs and artwork were mainly done in-house by Nintendo. The main game design was done by Shigeru Miyamoto and Katsuya Eguchi. Characters were designed by Takaya Imamura, and music was composed by Hajime Hirasawa. Nintendo suggested the &quot;arcade-style shooting&quot; element of the game and Argonaut brought the idea of using spaceships.

Miyamoto cited the X-Wings from &quot;Star Wars&quot; were an inspiration for the Arwings. He frequently visited the Fushimi Inari-taisha shrine, about a fifteen-minute walk from the Nintendo corporate headquarters, and the Senbon Torii gates there inspired the idea of gates that the player would need to pilot the ship through. Miyamoto stated that he wanted the &quot;Star Fox&quot; series to star animal characters since he was not interested in making a series with conventional science fiction stories with humans, robots, monsters, and superheroes. He decided to use a fox as a main character since it reminded him of Fushimi Inari-taisha. Miyamoto explained that he had always planned to use the English word &quot;fox&quot; instead of the Japanese word . Imamura used Japanese folklore as an inspiration to add a bird and a hare as two other protagonists. He also added a toad; the inspiration came from a staff member of Nintendo EAD who used a toad as his personal mascot. Imamura populated the Cornerian army with dogs and the enemy army with monkeys, and made General Pepper a dog and Andross a monkey, since there is a Japanese expression about fighting like dogs and monkeys. Miyamoto created several puppets and photographed them to use as artwork for the cover of the &quot;Star Fox&quot; game; Miyamoto was a fan of British puppet dramas, such as &quot;Thunderbirds&quot;, so he wanted the game cover to feature puppets. The game was released under the title &quot;Starwing&quot; in Europe due to the similarity of the title &quot;Star Fox&quot; to the name of the German company StarVox.

In documentary named &quot;High Score&quot;, Dylan Cuthbert and Giles Goddard discussed how when they moved to Kyoto to work in the Nintendo office, they were put in a room remotely located from the rest of Nintendo because due to the two of them not being full-time Nintendo employees, Nintendo did not want them to have access to confidential and secret projects they were working on at the time. They also discussed how Miyamoto would come visit them frequently, providing advice and feedback in between puffs of a cigarette, as Miyamoto was a notorious chain smoker at the time.

The game debuted at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held at Las Vegas in January 1993.
On the weekend of April 30 to May 2, 1993, the &quot;Super Star Fox Weekend Competition&quot; took place at approximately 2,000 retail locations within the United States. Competitors received a limited edition &quot;Star Fox&quot; pin, and those who accumulated a particularly high score received &quot;Star Fox&quot; T-shirts as prizes. The competitors who achieved the highest score at their respective locations were entered into a randomized grand prize drawing for a choice between an all-expenses-paid trip for four to a choice of London, Paris, Sydney, or Tokyo, or a lump sum of $15,000. The grand prize was won by Trevor Petersma of Garland, Texas, who opted for the cash prize. In the United Kingdom, the competition was known as the &quot;Starwing Challenge&quot; and was held in gaming shops across the country on May 29. Nintendo Netherlands held the &quot;Starwing&quot; competition at various game-selling stores in early 1993; the winner of each day won a large &quot;Starwing&quot; poster. Annual &quot;Starwing&quot; competitions were held during the Dutch Nintendo Championships, held in October, from 1993 to 1996. After the original competition, a limited number of the game cartridges created and used for the competition were sold through the &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; magazine, listed in the Spring 1994 &quot;Super Power Supplies&quot; catalogue that was mailed to subscribers, with an original list price of $45. The cartridges feature a time-limited single-player mode on modified stages, as well as an exclusive bonus level. The altered start-up screen displays &quot;Official Competition Cartridge&quot;.

According to Peter Main, Nintendo&#x27;s vice president of marketing at the time, &quot;Star Fox&quot; had a marketing budget of $15 million.

==Reception==
&quot;Star Fox&quot; was a critical success and commercial success upon release. It topped the Japanese &quot;Famitsu&quot; sales charts from February to March 1993, selling 325,000 units in Japan by December 1993. Nintendo sold more than 1.7 million units in Japan and the United States by the end of March 1993, becoming the fastest-selling video game launch in North America up until then. It also topped the UK sales chart in June 1993. It went on to sell over four million copies worldwide by 1998.

&quot;Star Fox&quot; received generally positive reviews. It holds an aggregate score of 88% at GameRankings, based on an average of seven reviews. The gameplay was generally praised, with many reviewers comparing it favourably to &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985) and &quot;After Burner&quot; (1987). It also received a 34 out of 40 from &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine, and a 4.125 out of 5 from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; Magazine. The game&#x27;s groundbreaking use of 3D polygon graphics were universally lauded. &quot;Next Gen Magazine&quot; pointed out Star Fox as helping pioneer the use of 3D video game graphics. The game has been used as an example of how, even with a fully polygon design, the game was still very similar to older games in that there was a set path to travel through each level.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the game an A and wrote that &quot;the first game to incorporate Nintendo&#x27;s &#x27;Super FX&#x27; computer chip, this pseudo-3D space shooter moves so fast that it practically qualifies as virtual reality. Unlike most games of this genre, though, &quot;Star Fox&quot; (&quot;Nintendo of America, for Super NES&quot;) shows some heart behind the hardware — rarely have such powerful spacecrafts been piloted by so adorable an array of frogs, birds, and bunnies&quot;.

===Accolades===
&quot;Star Fox&quot; was awarded Best Shooter of 1993 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. The game took the No. 115 spot on &quot;EGM&quot;″s &quot;The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time&quot;, and 82nd best game made on a Nintendo System in &quot;Nintendo Power&quot;″s Top 200 Games list. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; rated Star Fox 10th on their Top 100 SNES Games and wrote that because of the Super FX Chip the game&#x27;s graphics and gameplay are unlike any other SNES shooter. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; ranked the game 28th on a list of greatest Nintendo games. In 2018, &quot;Complex&quot; ranked Star Fox 24th in their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Star Fox&quot; has become an established Nintendo franchise, with six more installments and numerous appearances by its characters in other media such as the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series and &quot;&quot;. A direct sequel titled &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was developed for the Super NES but never released to market, although programmer Dylan Cuthbert reported that the game was completely finished. Although &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; was cancelled, some of the ideas and gameplay were salvaged for 1997&#x27;s &quot;Star Fox 64&quot; (released in Europe under the title &quot;Lylat Wars&quot;) for the Nintendo 64. Eventually, a handful of beta ROMs of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; at various stages of its development were leaked onto the internet, and a fan-made translation of &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; from Japanese to English was released in the form of a patch that could be applied to one of the leaked ROMs. A finalized version of the game, obtained from a complete ROM located in Nintendo&#x27;s archives, was released on the Super NES Classic Edition in September 2017.

In 2002, Rare&#x27;s &quot;Star Fox Adventures&quot; was released for GameCube. It was the first &quot;Star Fox&quot; game with action-adventure elements. The player acts as Fox McCloud on the world of Sauria, also known as Dinosaur Planet. In 2005, &quot;Star Fox: Assault&quot; was released for the GameCube, this time developed by Namco and specifically the same core team that handled the &quot;Ace Combat&quot; series. It incorporates third-person shooter elements into the game with grounded combat. &quot;Star Fox Command&quot;, developed by Q-Games released for the Nintendo DS in 2006, is the first game in the series on a portable system and the first to feature online multiplayer. It uses many features from the unreleased &quot;Star Fox 2&quot;, chiefly the real-time map and mission layout. &quot;Star Fox Zero&quot;, co-developed by Nintendo and PlatinumGames, was released in 2016 and returns to the storyline of the original game and &quot;Star Fox 64&quot;, while incorporating new elements such as the scrapped Walker transformation from &quot;Star Fox 2&quot; and a new Gyrowing vehicle.

During the game&#x27;s release, Nintendo teamed up with Kellogg&#x27;s and Nelsonic to develop and release a promotional &quot;Star Fox&quot; LCD game watch to those who bought a box of corn flakes and sent the order form to Kellogg&#x27;s to receive the &quot;Star Fox&quot; game watch for free. In the game watch, there are four levels and the object is to fly towards an attack carrier and destroy it while dodging plasma balls and falling structures. The game watch also includes a pair of earphones and a headphone jack due to the game watch missing a volume control. Nelsonic later released it in stores in a different watch appearance.

The conception and development of &quot;Super Mario 64&quot; was inspired by Miyamoto&#x27;s experience working on &quot;Star Fox&quot;.

<text>, officially named , is a Zen temple in the Sakyo ward of Kyoto, Japan. It is one of the constructions that represent the Higashiyama Culture of the Muromachi period.

== History ==

Ashikaga Yoshimasa initiated plans for creating a retirement villa and gardens as early as 1460, and it functioned as a pleasure villa for the shoguns to rest from their administrative duties. After his death, Yoshimasa arranged for this property to become a Zen temple under the name Jishō-ji. The temple is today associated with the Shokoku-ji branch of Rinzai Zen.

The two-storied , is the main temple structure. Its construction began February 21, 1482 (&quot;Bummei 14, fourth day of the second month&quot;). For the structure&#x27;s design, Yoshimasa sought to emulate the golden Kinkaku-ji, which had been commissioned by his grandfather Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. It is popularly known as &quot;Ginkaku&quot;, the &quot;Silver Pavilion,&quot; because of the initial plans to cover its exterior in silver foil, but this familiar nickname dates back only as far as the Edo period (1600–1868).

During the Ōnin War, construction was halted. Despite Yoshimasa&#x27;s intention to cover the structure with a distinctive silver foil overlay, this work was delayed so long that the plans were never realized before Yoshimasa&#x27;s death. The present appearance of the structure is understood to be the same as when Yoshimasa himself last saw it. This &quot;unfinished&quot; appearance illustrates one of the aspects of &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; quality.

Like Kinkaku-ji, Ginkaku-ji was originally built to serve as a place of rest and solitude for the Shōgun. During his reign as Shōgun, Ashikaga Yoshimasa inspired a new outpouring of traditional culture, which came to be known as &quot;Higashiyama Bunka&quot; (the Culture of the Eastern Mountain). Having retired to the villa, it is said Yoshimasa sat in the pavilion, contemplating the calm and beauty of the gardens as the Ōnin War worsened and Kyoto was burned to the ground.

In 1485, Yoshimasa became a Zen Buddhist monk. After his death on January 27, 1490 (&quot;Entoku 2, seventh day of the first month&quot;), the villa and gardens became a Buddhist temple complex, renamed Jishō-ji after Yoshimasa&#x27;s Buddhist name.

After extensive restoration, which started in February 2008, Ginkaku-ji is again in full glory to visit. The garden and temple complex are open to the public. There is still no silver foil used. After much discussion, it was decided not to refinish the lacquer to the original state. The lacquer finish was the source of the original silver appearance of the temple, with the reflection of the silver water of the pond on the lacquer finish.

== Garden ==

In addition to the temple&#x27;s famous building, the property features wooded grounds covered with a variety of mosses. This Japanese garden was supposedly designed by the great landscape artist Sōami.

In the later periods of Japanese garden history, fine stones were transported from a ruined or impoverished garden to a new one. According to the book &quot;Landscape design: A Cultural and Architectural History&quot; by Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, &quot;In 1474, following his retirement from the shogunate, Yoshimasa (1436-1490), had some of the stones and pine trees of the Flowery Palace and Muromachi Hall, both of which had been devastated by civil warfare, removed to his villa retreat at the base of Higashiyama (the Eastern Hills). There he lived from 1438 until his death, when the villa was converted to the Zen temple, Jisho-ji, or Ginkakuji (the Temple of the Silver Pavilion), as it is better known.&quot;

The Zen culture is not entirely represented in this garden because it was financed by the shogunate as a retreat and the primary use was aesthetic enjoyment. Instead of being designed by and for the use of monks, practitioners of zazen, or seated meditation.

Ginkakuji was constructed in relation to its surroundings. This is described in the &quot;Journal of Asian Studies&quot; by Ichito Ishida and Delmer M. Brown, &quot;The southeast corner of the first floor has openings in the walls, since a pond is located on that corner of the building, beyond which the moon rises between the peaks of Higashiyama. And since a lake extending northeastward reflected light that suffices even for reading, the room on the northeast corner has been planned as a library. Therefore, the natural objects do not merely surround the building, twisting it out of shape but supply intrinsic motivation for the structural design.&quot; The sand garden of Ginkaku-ji has become particularly well known; and the carefully formed pile of sand which is said to symbolize Mount Fuji is an essential element in the garden.

<text>The Chief of Staff to the Prime Minister is the top official in Canada&#x27;s Prime Minister&#x27;s Office (PMO). The position was created in 1987 to head the PMO.

Prior to the creation of the chief of staff position, the office was headed by the prime minister&#x27;s principal secretary, a position that is now secondary to the chief of staff. Individuals who held the position of principal secretary prior to 1987 were essentially &quot;de facto&quot; chiefs of staff, and may sometimes be informally referred to as chiefs of staff in some sources, but did not hold the formal title chief of staff.

Bernard Roy, Brian Mulroney&#x27;s principal secretary from 1984 to 1988, was the last principal secretary to act as head of the PMO before the creation of the chief of staff position.

<text>Huntington Bank Field is a stadium in Cleveland, Ohio. Primarily for American football. It is the home field of the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL), and serves as a venue for other events such as college and high school football, soccer, hockey, and concerts. It opened in 1999 as Cleveland Browns Stadium and was known as FirstEnergy Stadium from 2013 to 2023 before briefly reverting to its original name until 2024. The initial seating capacity was listed at 73,200 people, but following the first phase of a two-year renovation project in 2014, was reduced to the current capacity of 67,431. The stadium sits on of land between Lake Erie and the Cleveland Memorial Shoreway in the North Coast Harbor area of downtown Cleveland, adjacent to the Great Lakes Science Center and Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Cleveland Stadium stood on the site from 1931 to 1996.

==History==

Huntington Bank Field is located on the site of Cleveland Stadium, commonly called Cleveland Municipal Stadium, a multipurpose facility built in 1931 that served as the Browns&#x27; home field from their inception in 1946 through the 1995 season. During the 1995 season, owner Art Modell announced his plans to move the team to Baltimore, which resulted in legal action from the city of Cleveland and Browns season ticket holders. The day after the announcement was made, voters in Cuyahoga County approved an extension of the original 1990 sin tax on alcohol and tobacco products to fund renovations to Cleveland Stadium. Eventually, as part of the agreement between Modell, the city of Cleveland, and the NFL, the city agreed to tear down Cleveland Stadium and build a new stadium on the same site using the sin tax funds. Modell agreed to leave the Browns name, colors, and history in Cleveland and create a new identity for his franchise, eventually becoming the Baltimore Ravens, while the NFL agreed to reactivate the Browns by 1999 through expansion or relocation of another team. Demolition on the old stadium began in November 1996 and was completed in early 1997. Debris from the former stadium was submerged in Lake Erie and now serves as an artificial reef.

Ground was broken for the new stadium on May 15, 1997, and it opened in July 1999. The first event was a preseason game between the Browns and the Minnesota Vikings on August 21, followed the next week by a preseason game against the Chicago Bears. The first regular-season Browns game at the stadium was played the evening of September 12, 1999, a 43–0 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Since 2011, the stadium has been referred to by some as the &quot;Factory of Sadness&quot;, a name that was first coined that year by comedian and Browns fan Mike Polk. Polk made a video outside the stadium in which he complains about the team&#x27;s futility. In 2021, after the Browns defeated the Steelers at Acrisure Stadium, local TV station WKYC broadcast a segment with Polk where he &quot;closed&quot; the Factory of Sadness.

Through the 2023 season, Huntington Bank Field is the only NFL venue that has yet to host a postseason game of any kind. The Browns are one of five teams who have yet to host a home playoff game in their current stadium, along with the Atlanta Falcons, Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Chargers, and New York Jets. Those facilities, however, have each hosted the Super Bowl, while the Jets&#x27; home, MetLife Stadium, and the Chargers&#x27; home, SoFi Stadium, have also hosted home playoff games for their other tenants, the New York Giants and Los Angeles Rams, respectively.

=== Future ===
The Browns lease at the stadium is set to expire at the end of the 2028 season. Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb and the Cleveland Browns announced in October 2024 that the Browns plan to construct a new indoor stadium in suburban Brook Park, at a site adjacent to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, in time for the 2029 season. The current naming rights deal specifies that the Huntington Bank Field name will be transferred to the new facility once it opens.

==Facility==

The stadium was designed by Populous, which was known at the time as the Sport Venue Event Division of Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum (HOK). Indianapolis-based Huber, Hunt &amp; Nichols was the construction manager. The stadium is a concrete and glass structure, using precast concrete and cast in-place for the upper concourse. Natural stone accents were used at the base of the stadium. The construction of the concrete superstructure took more than 6,000 truckloads of concrete, or the equivalent of , with a weight of approximately .

The playing surface is a Kentucky Bluegrass irrigated field, with a sand-soil root zone and an underground heating system that involves nine boilers and of underground piping. The heating system prevents the field from freezing and extends the growing season of the turf. Although it was designed for football, the playing surface was built large enough to accommodate international soccer matches.

The eastern seating section is the home of the Dawg Pound, a section of bleacher seats. It was designed as a successor to the original Dawg Pound at Cleveland Stadium, the bleacher section also located in the east end zone. When Huntington Bank Field opened in 1999, the Dawg Pound was a 10,644, double-deck area. During stadium renovations in 2014, the upper level of the Dawg Pound was reduced to make way for a new, larger scoreboard, auxiliary scoreboard, and additional fan areas, and the bleacher seating in the upper level was replaced with chairbacks.

===Renovations===
In 2013, Browns owner Jimmy Haslam announced a modernization project for the stadium. The project included two phases that took place during the NFL offseasons in 2014 and 2015. Phase one included improving the audio system, installing new scoreboards three times the size of the original scoreboards and at the time the fourth largest in an NFL stadium, as well as adding more seats to the lower bowl. Phase two included concession improvements, upgrades to technology connectivity, graphics throughout the stadium, and enhancing the premium suites. The renovations reduced the stadium&#x27;s capacity to approximately 68,000. The total cost of the renovations was estimated at $120 million with the city of Cleveland paying $30 million over 15 years and the Browns covering the rest of the cost.

===Stadium naming===
The city specifically chose not to sell the naming rights to the stadium itself, which is highly unusual for major American stadiums built in recent years. However, it instead sold the naming rights to each of the facility&#x27;s four main entrance gates. Originally, the gates were named for National City Bank, Steris Corp., CoreComm Inc., and the Cleveland Clinic Sports Health. The arrangement was later discontinued, though has since been partially restored. As of the 2022 season, the southwest gate is sponsored by Meijer, the southeast gate is sponsored by University Hospitals of Cleveland, and the northeast gate by Electronic Merchant Systems.

Randy Lerner sold the Browns to Jimmy Haslam, CEO of truck stop chain Pilot Flying J, in August 2012. Before the deal officially closed in October 2012, Haslam announced he would sell the stadium&#x27;s naming rights. Haslam effectively ruled out his family business as buying the naming rights, mentioning that he had received offers for the naming rights, and that none of them are based in his home state of Tennessee. On January 14, 2013, it was reported that the naming rights were sold to FirstEnergy Corporation, the Akron-based electric utility serving most of northeastern Ohio. The Browns announced the following day that the stadium would be renamed &quot;FirstEnergy Stadium, Home of the Cleveland Browns&quot;, with the deal getting official Cleveland City Council approval on February 15, 2013. Ironically, the stadium&#x27;s power is actually generated and paid for through the city&#x27;s power utility, Cleveland Public Power, instead of FirstEnergy.

Because of the Ohio nuclear bribery scandal and FirstEnergy&#x27;s involvement in it, Cleveland City Council passed a resolution in June 2022 to urge FirstEnergy to relinquish its naming rights. At the time, the Browns nor FirstEnergy motioned that the agreement would be revoked. The Browns then announced on April 13, 2023, that the team and FirstEnergy had come to an agreement to immediately terminate the naming rights deal, restoring the stadium&#x27;s original moniker. The original agreement was set to expire in 2029.

Haslam Sports Group announced on September 3, 2024, they had sold naming rights to Huntington Bank, based in Columbus, Ohio, in a 20-year partnership agreement. If the team eventually moves to a new stadium elsewhere in the region, the naming rights will follow the team to the new facility.

===Services===
The stadium does not have public parking facilities. However, there are several adjacent parking facilities: the Port Authority visitors lot, the West 3rd Street parking lot, the Great Lakes Science Center parking garage, and the city of Cleveland municipal parking lots, the latter being where tailgating on game days is common. Additionally, the West 3rd Street station of Cleveland&#x27;s Waterfront light rail line serves the stadium.

==Other events==

In addition to home games for the Browns, the stadium hosts other events during the year, including college football, high school football, international soccer, concerts, and other events.

The Ohio Classic, a college football game featuring Historically Black Colleges and Universities, was held at the stadium in 2003 and 2005. In September 2006, it hosted the game between the Bowling Green Falcons and Wisconsin Badgers, which had an announced attendance of 30,307 people. From 2007 through 2009, the stadium hosted an event known as the Patriot Bowl, a season-opening game intended to showcase teams from the Mid-American Conference. The first Patriot Bowl featured the Army Black Knights and Akron Zips and drew 17,835 fans. The following season, Boston College defeated Kent State in the second Patriot Bowl on August 30, 2008 in front of 10,788 people. The third and final Patriot Bowl game was between the Ohio State Buckeyes and Toledo Rockets. While the game was considered a home game for Toledo, the crowd of 71,727 was mostly Ohio State fans.

Huntington Bank Field has hosted numerous high school football games, including playoff games of the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) tournament. In 2010 and 2011, the Browns revived the Charity Football Game, which had been held from 1931 to 1987 and was hosted at Cleveland Stadium until 1970. The revived version, called the High School Football Charity Games, was a doubleheader that featured four area high school teams. The 2010 edition, played August 28, featured Saint Edward High School and Mentor High School in the first game, and Saint Ignatius and Lake Catholic High School in the second game. The 2011 edition, played August 27, featured Mayfield High School and Medina High School in the first game, and Glenville High School and St. Edward High School in the second game. The rivalry game between two of the Cleveland area&#x27;s largest parochial high schools, St. Ignatius and St. Edward, has been held at the stadium on three occasions: October 2016, which had 17,400 fans in attendance; October 2018; and again in September 2020. St. Ignatius returned to the stadium in August 2022 against Mentor.

In addition to football and other field sports, Monster Jam has been held at the stadium on two occasions, the first being July 2, 2022, and then again on June 3, 2023. The stadium was also the setting for Progressive Corporation&#x27;s &quot;At Home&quot; campaign showing then-Browns quarterback Baker Mayfield living with his wife in the facility. Huntington Bank Field hosted the 37th edition of WWE&#x27;s premium live event &quot;SummerSlam&quot;, with an attendance of 57,791 on August 3, 2024.

===Soccer===

Huntington Bank Field is a periodic host for both the United States men&#x27;s (USMNT) and women&#x27;s national soccer (USWNT) teams. The stadium hosted a match between the USMNT and Venezuela in the run-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, a 2–0 victory for the US, and a 4–2 loss in 2013 against Belgium that drew 27,720 fans. The stadium, then known as FirstEnergy Stadium, hosted games in the group stage of the 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup, with the USMNT playing July 15, 2017, against Nicaragua as part of a doubleheader that also included Panama and Martinique. Both Panama and the United States won their respective matches by a score of 3–0. The stadium again hosted group stage play during the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, with Panama defeating Guyana 4–2 and the USMNT winning 6–0 over Trinidad and Tobago.

The USWNT has played at the stadium on three occasions, with the most recent being in 2018. It hosted a 4–0 friendly victory against Germany in 2010 and the second leg of a friendly series with Japan in 2016, a 2–0 win for the USWNT. The game against Japan had 23,535 fans in attendance, the largest crowd to see the USWNT play in Ohio. The USWNT returned on June 12, 2018, in a game against China, won by the U.S. 2–1.

On April 19, 2025, Columbus Crew and Inter Miami CF will play a Major League Soccer regular season game at the stadium to capitalize on the popularity of Inter Miami player and soccer legend Lionel Messi.

===Concerts===
A limited number of concerts have been held at Huntington Bank Field since it opened. The first concert held in the stadium was George Strait in 2000, followed in 2001 by NSYNC, as part of their &quot;PopOdyssey&quot; Tour, and The Three Tenors. Kenny Chesney has performed at the stadium on three occasions.

===Hockey===

Huntington Bank Field has also served as an outdoor venue for ice hockey, the first time being in early 2023. The headline event was announced August 22, 2022, a college ice hockey game between Michigan and Ohio State, titled Faceoff on the Lake. Later, on October 11, 2022, it was announced that the stadium would also host an American Hockey League game between the Cleveland Monsters and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, titled the Cleveland Monsters Outdoor Classic. The games highlighted multiple events the stadium hosted using the temporary ice rink built on the playing field.

The first ice hockey game played at the stadium on February 17, 2023, between John Carroll University and Canisius College of the American Collegiate Hockey Association, a club-level college ice hockey league. The game, titled the “John Carroll University Outdoor Classic”, was won by John Carroll, 5–4. Faceoff on the Lake was held the following day, where Ohio State defeated Michigan 4–2 in front of 45,523 fans, which set an attendance record for an outdoor college hockey game at a neutral site. The Cleveland Monsters Outdoor Classic was held March 4, but the start had to be delayed five hours due to ice conditions. The Monsters went on to defeat the Penguins 3–2 in overtime with an attendance of 22,875.

<doc id="626701" wikidata="Q1422671" url="?curid=626701" title="Diffusion of responsibility">
<text>Diffusion of responsibility is a sociopsychological phenomenon whereby a person is less likely to take responsibility for action or inaction when other bystanders or witnesses are present. Considered a form of attribution, the individual assumes that others either are responsible for taking action or have already done so.

The diffusion of responsibility refers to the decreased responsibility of action each member of a group feels when they are part of a group. For example, in emergency situations, individuals feel less responsibility to respond or call for help, if they know that there are others also watching the situation –
if they know they are a part of the group of witnesses. In other group settings (in which a group is appointed to complete a task or reach a certain goal), the diffusion of responsibility manifests itself as the decreased responsibility each member feels to contribute and work hard towards accomplishing the task or goal. The diffusion of responsibility is present in almost all groups, but to varying degrees, and can be mitigated by reducing group size, defining clear expectations, and increasing accountability.

Assumption of responsibility tends to decrease when the potential helping group is larger, resulting in little aiding behavior demonstrated by the bystander(s). Causes range from psychological effects of anonymity to differences in sex. Implication of behaviours related to diffusion of responsibility can be threatening as there have been increases in moral disengagement and helping behaviour.

== Real-world examples ==
In many real-world examples, it can be difficult to say with complete certainty that certain events happened or happen because of a sociopsychological effect such as diffusion of responsibility, the reasons being that in these events, there are many other contributing factors. Many of these events have also been traumatizing for the individuals who have recounted them. In situations which have known to increase anxiety, events have been found to be interpreted more dangerously or inaccurately than they appear. While accurate representation of events may be questionable, there have been extensive analyses on the following events regarding diffusion of responsibility and applications of its concept.

===World War II===
The diffusion of responsibility for alleged war crimes during World War II was famously used as a legal defense by many of the Nazis being tried at Nuremberg. A similar defense was mounted by the defendants accused in the My Lai massacre. Because of the displacement of responsibility, they did not feel the personal responsibility to help or at least not harm victims, but they felt like they were just following orders, and they did not feel responsible or guilty for their own actions. They blamed those telling them to carry out the orders rather than blaming themselves for the atrocities they had committed. The diffusion of responsibility is a probable cause for many of their feelings and actions, but other possible contributing factors include the existing antisemitism of Germany at that time and the threats imposed by Nazi officials.

===Workplace===
Diffusion of responsibility can be seen in the workplace through the response to mass email when compared to many, individualized emails. When mass emails are sent out, people feel a lack of accountability because the emails have not been addressed to them personally. Studies have shown that replies to personally addressed emails are more helpful and lengthier than replies to mass emails because personal interactions are associated with a greater sense of responsibility. For example, the author of reports sending thousands of emails to professors at universities worldwide, inviting them to recommend a journal to their students. The response rate has been extremely low, especially when using blind carbon copy (bcc) to reach multiple recipients simultaneously.

Another example of diffusion of responsibility revolves around whistleblowing in the work place. Many people employed by companies that regularly committed accounting fraud do not blow the whistle. This is due to lack of individual accountability and moral disengagement. It has been shown that many people often get so focused on their individual tasks, they forget to think about moral responsibilities in an organization. Thus whistleblowing may not even be considered. Moreover, in companies where it is promoted, people still do not participate since they assume others will take the responsibility, causing feelings similar to a lack of accountability.

===Self-driving cars===

Autonomous cars require a human driver to be attentive at all times, and intervene if necessary. One safety concern is that humans are less likely to maintain attention if the automated system has partial responsibility for driving.

== Causes ==
Diffusion of responsibility occurs in large group settings and under both prosocial and antisocial conditions. In prosocial situations, individuals&#x27; willingness to intervene or assist someone in need is inhibited by the presence of other people. The individual is under the belief that other people present will or should intervene. Thus, the individual does not perceive it as her or his responsibility to take action. This will not happen if the individual believes that they are the only one aware of the situation. If a bystander is deciding how to help, they may abstain from doing so if they believe that they lack the competence to be of aid. Individuals may become reluctant to provide help for fear of how observers will view them.

===Anonymity===
In addition, diffusion of responsibility is more likely to occur under conditions of anonymity. In prosocial situations, individuals are less likely to intervene when they do not know the victim personally. Instead, they believe that someone who has a relationship with the victim will assist. In antisocial situations, negative behaviours are more likely to be carried out when the person is in a group of similarly motivated individuals. The behaviour is driven by the deindividuating effects of group membership and the diffusion of feelings of personal responsibility for the consequences. As part of this process, individuals become less self-aware and feel an increased sense of anonymity. As a result, they are less likely to feel responsible for any antisocial behaviour performed by their group. Diffusion of responsibility is also a causal factor governing much crowd behaviour, as well as risk-taking in groups.

Contrary to anonymity, it has been shown that if one can utilise technology to prevent anonymity, it can further prevent diffusion of responsibility. Studies have shown that if emails are sent directly to individuals as opposed to addressing individuals in mass emails, they can prevent diffusion of responsibility and elicit more responses. In addition to eliciting more responses, the responses that were received from individuals, as opposed to groups, were longer and more helpful to the initial questions asked.

===Division of labor===
Diffusion of responsibility can manifest itself in the workplace when tasks are assigned to individuals in terms of division of labor. In an economics context, diffusion of responsibility can be observed in groups when a leader assigns tasks to individuals. To promote the concept of fairness, the leader will generally assign an equal amount of work to individuals within the group. This is in part due to the idea that people in general want to seem fair and kind.

According to Albert Bandura, diffusion of responsibility can occur when managers create subtasks in an organization. When people are subdivided into individual tasks they can often forget their role to the organization as a whole and get narrow minded into focusing on their own role. Individuals may unknowingly diffuse their responsibility to an organization by only doing what is required of them in their respective tasks. This is because their focus for accountability is diverted from the organization to their individualized tasks.

===Expertise===
In organisations, diffusion of responsibility can be observed on the basis of roles and differing levels of expertise. For instance, in a hierarchical structure, where your position in the organisation is associated with your level of engagement to the group, people tend to diffuse accountability to those with greater responsibility and a higher level in the structure. Evidence from numerous research studies suggests &quot;followers&quot; have not taken responsibility because they feel they have a lower status in the organisation. Many individuals in a group assume those with a greater level of power are held accountable for more and assume they take on a greater level of responsibility. The association of level of expertise or role and the amount of work required can cause people to feel varying levels of responsibility and accountability for their own contributions.

===Group size===
Because of the diffusion of responsibility, people feel that their need to intervene in a situation decreases as the number of other (perceived) witnesses increases. In an experiment that John Darley and Bibb Latané conducted in 1968, it was found that a subject was much less likely to help someone having a seizure when the subject thought that at least one other subject was also hearing the individual have a seizure. The subject&#x27;s likeliness to help decreased with the number of other subjects (up to four) he or she thought were also listening to the seizure. Group size is a key factor to the diffusion of responsibility, as in a different study, it was additionally found that the probability of an individual volunteering to be a primary helper or leader also decreases as the size of the group grows.

===Gender===
Research in the past has shown that gender does play a role in terms of how people make decisions about helping others. With regards to social responsibility of helping others in need, people feel less inclined to help those who they think need it less. Based on previous research, people have generally helped women and diffusion of responsibility is more prevalent when males have needed help because the general stereotype was that men don&#x27;t need help and can handle situations on their own, whereas women were perceived as weaker than men. New research has shown that with changing viewpoints on gender stereotypes, diffusion of responsibility is less prevalent when a lone woman is in need of assistance due to the women&#x27;s liberation movement, which has helped change those stereotypes.

== Consequences ==
===Groupthink===
Groupthink occurs when each of the individuals composing a group desires and cares more about reaching consensus and total agreement than critically examining, understanding, and utilising information.

Engaging in groupthink seeks to avoid any possible conflict or disagreement when making any decisions or actions, preferring compromises that may not be thought through to well-thought out arguments that do not receive unanimous approval from the group. Thus, groupthink cannot lead to the best decisions or solutions. Groupthink occurs when the group members are familiar with each other and seek each other&#x27;s approval, especially in stressful situations. The diffusion of responsibility contributes to groupthink as when the diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, each group member feels less of a responsibility to express his or her own opinions or ideas, which leads to groupthink. Thus, when diffusion of responsibility occurs within groups, groupthink is also much more likely to occur.

===Social loafing===
Social loafing is the tendency for individuals to expend less effort when working collectively than when working individually. Social impact theory considers the extent to which individuals can be viewed as either sources or targets of social influence. When individuals work collectively, the demands of an outside source of social influence (e.g., an experimenter or one&#x27;s boss) are diffused across multiple targets (i.e., diffusion of responsibility across all of the group members), leading to decreased levels of effort. On individual tasks, no such diffusion takes place, and individuals work hard, as there is no diffusion of responsibility. The division of social influence is thought to be a function of the strength, immediacy, and number of sources and targets present, and is predicted to follow an inverse power function specifying that each additional group member will have less influence as group size increases. Diffusion of responsibility is a direct cause of social loafing, as when diffusion of responsibility is occurring within a group, group members do not feel as responsible for their actions (or lack of action) and are much more likely to engage in social loafing.

===Helping behavior===
Social psychological experiments have demonstrated that individuals&#x27; failure to assist others in emergencies is not due to apathy or indifference, but rather to the presence of other people. This is explained by both bystander effect and diffusion of responsibility. In 1968 and a series of experiments that followed, John Darley and Bibb Latané demonstrated that an individual&#x27;s choice to help or intervene when there is an emergency depends on the number of bystanders. Group size significantly influenced the likelihood of helping behavior in a staged emergency: 85% of participants responded with intervention when alone, 62% of participants took action when with one other person, and only 31% did when there were four other bystanders. Other studies have replicated the phenomenon, including reports from real emergencies such as calling an ambulance for overdose patients and offering CPR after cardiac arrest.

In ambiguous situations, the individual&#x27;s appraisal of the situation and subsequent action or inaction largely depends on the reactions of other people. Other bystanders&#x27; interpretation of an emergency influences perception of the incident and helping behavior. In one study, diffusion of responsibility does not occur if another bystander is perceived as being unable to help.

Group psychology can also influence behaviour positively; in the event that one bystander takes responsibility for the situation and takes specific action, other bystanders are more likely to follow course. This is a positive example of the usually-pejorative herd mentality. Thus, the presence of bystanders affects individual helping behaviour by processes of social influence and diffusion of responsibility.

=== Moral disengagement ===
Diffusion of responsibility can negatively affect personal morals. With diffusion of responsibility, it has been found that people feel less accountable for their work. This lack of accountability can be because labour is divided amongst members in a group and so no one member feels an overwhelming amount of responsibility for their organisation or their overall project. It has been found that many members get narrowed into focusing on their individual work, that they eventually forget about any moral aspects. Purely focusing on the functional aspects of their jobs is a result of division of labour, which is a mechanism for diffusion of responsibility. This can be highly concerning for organisations since division of labour is a common practice amongst many.

Moral disengagement is likely to be particularly important in organisations because bureaucratic structures and the division of labour seem to lend themselves to moral disengagement mechanisms such as the diffusion and displacement of responsibility. Euphemistic labelling is also common in organisations, such as when managers refer to layoffs as “rightsizing.” Also, with victims out of sight, globalization makes it easier to ignore or distort the harmful consequences of business actions. Thus, moral disengagement seems highly relevant to understanding unethical behaviour in 21st century organizations.

===Risk-taking behaviour===
The risky-shift effect (see groupshift) is the increased likelihood for a group to support or partake in a risky decision or action. Larger groups permit a wider responsibility diffusion than the groups of two or three. As group size increases, the likelihood also increases that the group contains at least one highly risky and influential member who would be able to win over all the others. This demonstrates how larger group size and the increased riskiness of one person can cause the diffusion of responsibility from all group members to only the decisive, risk-taking member. From the group-processes standpoint, then, the risky-shift effect becomes stronger as the groups grow larger. And it has been proved by various studies that the risky-shift effect is more pronounced the larger the size of the group.

In risk-taking literature, diffusion of responsibility occurs when individual members of a group feel less personal responsibility for potential failure in the pursuit of risky options than if acting alone.

Such risky shift is a stable phenomenon that has been shown in experiments involving group discussion and consensus. For example, a study using risks and payoffs based on monetary gain and loss for problem-solving performance found a greater percentage of shift—hence, increased risk taking in group decision making.

Other research suggests that risky shifts can also be attributed to group polarization, majority rules, interpersonal comparisons, informational influence, and familiarisation. Like diffusion of responsibility in emergency situations, the larger the size of the group during conditions of discussion and information exchange, the greater the risky shift.

=== Bystander effect ===

Rising from the unfortunate case of Catherine &quot;&quot;&quot;Kitty&quot; Genovese, the bystander effect is a psychological notion that came to light in the 1960s. Catherine Genovese&#x27;s case seems to cast a predominantly daunting light on human behavior. The event highlights the lessening of the likelihood of a person taking immediate action in a certain situation while part of a group or around other people.

Darley and Latané (1968) performed a study that viewed whether the presence of other bystanders would affect the likelihood and speed of which the subjects would respond to hearing another subject (a confederate) having a seizure. The subjects either believed they were in a two-person group, three-person group, or a six-person group. The researchers concluded that subjects were less likely to help the greater the number of bystanders, demonstrating the bystander effect.

The bystander effect is a specific type of diffusion of responsibility—when people&#x27;s responses to certain situations depend on the presence of others. The bystander effect occurs when multiple individuals are watching a situation unfold but do not intervene (or delay or hesitate to intervene) because they know that someone else could intervene, and they feel less responsibility to do so. This is directly caused by the diffusion of responsibility, as it is shown that individuals are much less likely to intervene in a situation when he or she knows others are watching; thus, the responsibility for helping is spread among the group of bystanders, and each bystander does not feel a strong responsibility to do so, so no one helps.

However, it has been shown that people&#x27;s responses and levels of aid can change depending on the type of situation (emergencies versus non-emergencies) as well.

<doc id="626702" wikidata="Q152475" url="?curid=626702" title="Chamber pot">
<text>A chamber pot is a portable toilet, meant for nocturnal use in the bedroom. It was common in many cultures before the advent of indoor plumbing and flushing toilets.

==Names and etymology==
&quot;Chamber&quot; is an older term for bedroom. The chamber pot is also known as a , a jerry, a guzunder, a po (possibly from ), a potty pot, a potty, a thunder pot or a thunder mug. It was also known as a chamber utensil or bedroom ware.

==History==
Chamber pots were used in ancient Greece at least since the 6th century BC and were known under different names: (&quot;amis&quot;), (&quot;ouranē&quot;) and (&quot;ourētris&quot;, from - &quot;ouron&quot;, &quot;urine&quot;), / (&quot;skōramis&quot;), (&quot;chernibion&quot;).

The introduction of indoor flush toilets started to displace chamber pots in the 19th century, but they remained common until the mid-20th century. The alternative to using the chamber pot was a trip to the outhouse.

In China, the chamber pot (便壶 (biàn hú) was common. A wealthy salt merchant in the city of Yangzhou became the symbol of conspicuous excess when he commissioned a chamber pot made of gold which was so tall that he had to climb a ladder to use it.
==Modern use==

Chamber pots continue in use in areas lacking indoor plumbing.

In the Philippines, chamber pots are used as urinals and are known as &quot;arinola&quot; in most Philippine languages, such as Cebuano and Tagalog.

In Korea, chamber pots are referred to as &quot;yogang&quot; (요강). They were used by people who did not have indoor plumbing to avoid the cold elements during the winter months.

===Children&#x27;s potties===
The term &quot;potty&quot; is usually used to refer to the small, toilet-shaped devices made especially for children training to use the toilet, also called potty training, which are similar to chamber pots. These &quot;potties&quot; are generally a large plastic bowl with an ergonomically designed back and front to protect against splashes. They may have a built-in handle or grasp at the back to allow easy emptying and a non-slip bottom to prevent the child from sliding while in use. Some are given bright colors, and others may feature gentle or unoffensive drawings or cartoon characters. In many cases they are used since it is difficult for children to maneuver themselves up onto the normal toilet; in addition the larger opening in the regular toilet is much too wide for a child to sit over comfortably and can be intimidating when they first start learning. The size of a potty chair means they can be packed away in a bag for days out or when camping with young children. 

==Shapes and related items==

A chamber pot might be disguised in a sort of chair (a close stool). It might be stored in a cabinet with doors to hide it; this sort of nightstand was known as a commode, hence the latter word came to mean &quot;toilet&quot; as well. For homes without these items of furniture, the chamber pot was stored under the bed.

The modern commode toilet and bedpan, used by bedbound or disabled persons, are variants of the chamber pot.

A related item was the &quot;bourdalou&quot; or &quot;bourdaloue&quot;, a small handheld oblong ceramic pot used in 17th- and 18th-century France to allow women to urinate conveniently. This item, similar in shape to a deep gravy boat, could be held between the legs and urinated into while standing or crouching, with little risk of soiling their clothing. At the time, women did not customarily wear two-legged underwear as today.

==Cultural references==
&quot;The Crabfish&quot; is a 17th-century folk song about what is most likely a common lobster, stored in a chamber pot by an unwise fisherman. The moral of the song is that one should look into a chamberpot before using it.

Philippine mythology recounts that giving newlyweds a chamber pot assures them of prosperity. President Elpidio Quirino, as part of a smear campaign against him, was falsely rumoured to possess a golden &quot;arinola&quot;.

In his satire &quot;Utopia&quot;, Thomas More had chamberpots made out of gold.

<doc id="626703" wikidata="Q7804024" url="?curid=626703" title="Tim Murphy (Canadian politician)">
<text>Timothy John Murphy (born August 7, 1959) is a former Canadian politician and was the chief of staff of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office under Paul Martin&#x27;s government. He is currently CEO of McMillan LLP, and chair of the Windsor–Detroit Bridge Authority.

==Background==
Tim Murphy was born in Barrie, Ontario. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Queen&#x27;s University in 1982 and a law degree from the University of Toronto. He practiced law with Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon and also served as a special advisor to Attorney General Ian Scott and a senior advisor to Ontario Minister of Education Sean Conway. In 1989–90, he ran the Ontario Campaign during Paul Martin&#x27;s first unsuccessful bid for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada. In 2022 he became CEO of McMillan LLP. He lives in Toronto with his wife and daughter.

==Politics==
When Ian Scott resigned his legislative seat in late 1992, a by-election was called for April 1, 1993 to replace him. Murphy ran to succeed Scott as the Liberal member for St. George—St. David, and was successful in both winning the nomination and defeating Progressive Conservative Nancy Jackman by 2,232 votes in the by-election.

St. George—St. David, which is now part of Toronto Centre, included the Church and Wellesley neighbourhood, the largest gay village in Ontario. Although Murphy is not himself gay, he soon emerged as a leading spokesperson in the Ontario legislature for progressive legislation pertaining to the rights of same-sex couples, introducing a private member&#x27;s bill in 1993 which would have partially extended spousal benefits. He was one of only three Liberal MPPs, along with Jean Poirier and Dianne Poole, to support Bill 167, the Bob Rae government&#x27;s more sweeping same-sex benefits package in 1994, and was critical of Liberal leader Lyn McLeod&#x27;s decision to oppose the bill.

Murphy was defeated in the 1995 provincial election, losing his seat to Progressive Conservative Al Leach by 337 votes while New Democratic candidate Brent Hawkes was a close third.

==Later life==
He returned to practicing law with McCarthy Tétrault, and served for a time as president of the Ontario Liberal Party. He supported Dwight Duncan&#x27;s bid for the Ontario party leadership in 1996.

On June 28, 2001, Murphy was hired by Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin as a senior political advisor. When Martin became Prime Minister in late 2003, he appointed Murphy as his chief of staff. Murphy was considered to be one of the most influential figures in the Canadian Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, helping formulate policy matters as well as coordinating meetings with ministers and departments and with foreign heads of state.

After the Martin government was defeated in the 2006 federal election, Murphy returned to Toronto where he joined the law firm of McMillan Binch Mendelsohn.

Murphy served as a political panelist on Global&#x27;s coverage of the 2006 Liberal leadership convention. He was co-chair of the Wynne campaign in the Ontario provincial election.

In 2016 he was part of the founding team of McMillan Vantage Policy Group, a national full-service public affairs consultancy—the only one of its kind anchored in a national law firm offering services to Canadian-based and international clients.

He is an adjunct Professor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law teaching the Law and Policy of Public Private Partnerships at the JD and LLM levels.

He is a frequent commentator on CBC News Network&#x27;s &quot;Power &amp; Politics&quot;, and has also written articles for Policy Options, The Walrus, Canadian Public Administration Journal and The Globe and Mail, Ottawa Citizen and Toronto Star.

In 2021, he was appointed as the chair of the Windsor–Detroit Bridge Authority.

<doc id="626707" wikidata="Q254985" url="?curid=626707" title="Vladimír Remek">
<text>Vladimír Remek (born 26 September 1948) is a Czech politician and diplomat, as well as a former cosmonaut and military pilot. He flew aboard Soyuz 28 from 2 to 10 March 1978, becoming the first and only Czechoslovak in space. As the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and with the entry of the Czech Republic and Slovakia into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. Remek was a member of the European Parliament between 2004 and 2013 for the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia. From 2014 to 2018, he was the Czech Ambassador to Russia.

==Early life and military career==

Remek was born on 26 September 1948 in České Budějovice (now in the Czech Republic). He spent two years studying at the observatory in Kraví hora, Brno between 1962 and 1964. Remek was influenced by his father, Jozef Remek, himself a military pilot.
Remek was an active member both in the Pioneers and the Czechoslovak Union of Youth. He studied mathematics and physics at middle school in Čáslav where he earned awards in track running the 400-meter, 800-meter, and 1,500-meter events. Remek graduated in 1966 and proceeded to &quot;Vyšší Letecké Učiliště&quot;, an aviation school in Košice, where he trained in an Aero L-29 Delfín. Remek graduated in 1970, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Czechoslovak Air Force. Remek served as a fighter pilot, flying MiG-21s in the 1st Fighter Air Regiment. In the 1970s Remek married his first wife, Czech actress Hana Davidová, the daughter of politician Václav David. They had a daughter together, Anna, in 1980. He had a second daughter, Jana, three years after the first, with his second wife, also called Jana.

From 1972 to 1976, Remek studied at the Gagarin Air Force Academy. Upon his return to Czechoslovakia in 1976, he was promoted to captain and appointed deputy commander of his fighter regiment, after which Remek went back to Russia to train for the Soviet-led space program. Following his return from space in March 1978, Remek spent time in the Czechoslovak People&#x27;s Army (ČSLA) staff as the deputy director of the Flight Research Institute in Prague. In 1986, Remek became the deputy commander of a flight division based in Čáslav. In 1988, he graduated from Voroshilov-Staff Academy of Soviet Air Force and was appointed to his highest command, as deputy of the 2nd Air Defense Division stationed in Moravia. Following the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Remek was relegated to a role as Director of the Museum for Aviation and Astronautics in Prague. Following his retirement from the Czech Air Force in 1995, Remek represented Czech firm CZ Strakonice and joint venture CZ–Turbo-GAZ in Moscow.

==Interkosmos program==

Remek (then a Captain) joined the Interkosmos program in 1976; his backup was Oldřich Pelčák, the other Czechoslovak cosmonaut selected to participate with the program. During the flight, Remek experimented with the Kristall furnace on board the capsule. The mission, coinciding with the 30th anniversary of the Soviet-backed 1948 Czechoslovak coup d&#x27;état, and including Remek, the son of a Czech mother and Slovak father, had propaganda value in stressing Czechoslovak-Soviet cooperation. Remek himself has not denied this although he retains pride in his voyage regardless of the circumstances. On the Soyuz 28 mission that launched 2 March 1978, he became the first cosmonaut from a country other than the Soviet Union or the United States, and with the entry of the Czech Republic into the European Union, Remek is considered to be the first astronaut from the European Union. After Remek&#x27;s flight, he was celebrated in his home country with a series of receptions at factories and other civil workplaces. He was also recognized at a ceremony at Prague Castle as a guest of Gustáv Husák, then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia. On 16 March, Remek and Aleksei Gubarev, the other member of the crew, were awarded the medal Hero of the Soviet Union. Czechoslovak reaction to Remek&#x27;s flight included comments about the media&#x27;s inundation focused on Remek and the fact that he was only able to journey with a Soviet cosmonaut as if Remek needed a minder. One joke went: &quot;Why didn&#x27;t the Soviets send up two Czechoslovak cosmonauts? Because they would&#x27;ve landed in West Germany.&quot; Remek himself joked that his Soviet counterpart would slap Remek&#x27;s hands off of controls if he touched anything without permission. French astronaut Jean-Loup Chrétien experienced this same behavior onboard Soyuz TM-7 in 1988.

==Political career==

Due in part to his previous business contacts in Russia, Remek was appointed to the Czech Embassy in Moscow as a Trade and Economic Counselor. During the 2004 European Parliament election, Remek was a candidate for the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia and, being second on the list behind Miloslav Ransdorf, was elected into the European Parliament. During his first term (20 July 2004 to 13 July 2009), Remek was a member of the Confederal Group of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left in the European Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;European Parliament / MEPs &quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was a vocal proponent of the EU&#x27;s Galileo satellite constellation, warning that bureaucratic delay could cede opportunity to the BeiDou, a Chinese competitor. He was reelected in 2009. When Petr Kolář resigned as the Czech Ambassador to Russia in December 2012, the ambassadorship sat empty for a year until the President of the Czech Republic, Miloš Zeman, appointed Remek in January 2014. The appointment met with controversy as it was against the wishes of Zeman&#x27;s Foreign Minister, Karel Schwarzenberg. Observers have noted Remek has a friendly history with the Russians and although his communist affiliations are a minority in Russia, his appointment represents Zeman&#x27;s pragmatic and pro-Russia stance.

==In popular culture==

Czech astronomer Antonín Mrkos discovered an asteroid in September 1978 and named it 2552 Remek after the cosmonaut. Remek is featured in a 2009 independent comedy film called &quot;Osadne&quot; about three residents from Osadné that seek out Remek at his office in Brussels to help tourism in their town. Sculptor Jan Bartoš created a statue of Remek and Gubarev, which is located at Háje metro station, formerly known as Kosmonautů (meaning [station] of the cosmonauts) until 1990, in Prague. Another statue of Remek is located in Košice, Slovakia.

<text>Hydroiodic acid (or hydriodic acid) is a colorless liquid. It is an aqueous solution of hydrogen iodide with the chemical formula . It is a strong acid, in which hydrogen iodide is ionized completely in an aqueous solution. Concentrated aqueous solutions of hydrogen iodide are usually 48% to 57% HI by mass.
==Preparation==
==Reactions==
Hydroiodic acid reacts with oxygen in air to give iodine:

Like hydrogen halides, hydroiodic acid adds to alkenes to give alkyl iodides. It can also be used as a reducing agent, for example in the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds to anilines.

===Cativa process===
The Cativa process is a major end use of hydroiodic acid, which serves as a co-catalyst for the production of acetic acid by the carbonylation of methanol.

===Illicit uses===
Hydroiodic acid is listed as a U.S. Federal DEA List I Chemical, owing to its use as a reducing agent related to the production of methamphetamine from ephedrine or pseudoephedrine (recovered from nasal decongestant pills).

<doc id="626713" wikidata="Q1067148" url="?curid=626713" title="Acrisure Stadium">
<text>Acrisure Stadium, formerly (and still colloquially) known as Heinz Field, is a football stadium located in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. It primarily serves as the home of the Pittsburgh Steelers of the National Football League (NFL) and the Pittsburgh Panthers of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). The stadium opened in 2001 as Heinz Field, following the controlled implosion of the teams&#x27; previous home, Three Rivers Stadium. In 2021, the owners of the Heinz name, now owned by Kraft Heinz declined to renew the stadium&#x27;s naming rights. The City of Pittsburgh green-lit Acrisure&#x27;s bid to purchase the rights in 2022.

Funded in conjunction with PNC Park and the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, the $281 million (equivalent to $ million in ) stadium stands along the Ohio River, on the North Side of Pittsburgh in the North Shore neighborhood. The stadium was designed with the city&#x27;s history of steel production in mind, which led to the inclusion of 12,000 tons of steel into construction. Ground for the stadium was broken in June 1999, and the first football game was hosted in September 2001. The stadium&#x27;s natural-grass surface has been criticized throughout its history, but Steelers owners have kept the grass after lobbying from players and coaches. The 68,400-seat stadium has sold out for most Steelers home games, a streak that dates to 1972. A collection of Steelers and Panthers memorabilia is in the Great Hall.

The stadium has hosted two outdoor hockey games: the 2011 NHL Winter Classic between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals, and the 2017 NHL Stadium Series game between the Penguins and Philadelphia Flyers. The venue has also hosted numerous concerts; on June 17, 2023, Taylor Swift&#x27;s The Eras Tour performance was attended by 73,117 people, the highest-ticketed event in Pittsburgh history.

==History==
===Planning and funding===
The Pittsburgh Steelers and Pittsburgh Pirates shared Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pirates building a full-time baseball park, a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility. Although the Steelers&#x27; owners disliked the idea, the proposal was used as a &quot;fallback position&quot; that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed. The Steelers&#x27; owners said failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise&#x27;s chances of signing players who might sign with other teams, such as the other three teams in the AFC North, who had all recently built new football-only stadiums. In June 2001, the H. J. Heinz Company purchased the naming rights to the stadium. Per the deal, Heinz would pay the Steelers a total of $57 million through 2021, the &quot;57&quot; being an intentional reference to Heinz 57. Despite Heinz later announcing its acquisition of Kraft Foods Group to form Kraft Heinz Company in 2015, the stadium&#x27;s name was retained.

Originally, a sales tax increase was proposed to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and an expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. After the rejection of this proposal in a 1997 referendum known as the &quot;Regional Renaissance Initiative&quot;, the city developed the alternate funding proposal &quot;Plan B&quot;. Similarly controversial, the proposal was labeled &quot;Scam B&quot; by opponents. The Steelers&#x27; pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50 million to $76.5 million. Other local government members criticized the $281 million of public money allocated for &quot;Plan B&quot;. One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars &quot;corporate welfare&quot;. The plan, totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field. Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers made a deal with Pittsburgh city officials to stay in the city until at least 2031. The total cost of Heinz Field was $281 million.

===Design and construction===

HOK Sport designed the stadium. HOK Sport&#x27;s project manager for the project, Melinda Lehman, said that the Rooney family asked for the stadium&#x27;s design to &quot;acknowledge the history of Pittsburgh and also bring in an element of looking forward, this is where Pittsburgh is going.&quot; In order to accomplish this, HOK Sport used steel structurally and externally. The stone used in Acrisure Stadium&#x27;s design is artificial, in order to decrease cost. Of the glass used in the stadium&#x27;s design, Lehman said, &quot;The glass is a more modern building element, which ties into a lot of the buildings in [Downtown] Pittsburgh and gives great views of the surrounding areas.&quot; The Steelers and Panthers have their own locker rooms, which differ in size based on the number of players each team is permitted to dress for each game. The visitor facilities are modeled after the home locker rooms&#x27; design. As with its predecessor, Acrisure Stadium&#x27;s culinary service provider is Aramark; over 400 eateries are located throughout the stadium. A bronze statue of Steelers founder Art Rooney, similar to those located outside PNC Park, was moved from its previous position outside Three Rivers Stadium. In addition, a statue of a Pitt Panther over a paved depiction of Pitt&#x27;s Cathedral of Learning was placed outside Gate A. Upon opening in 2001, Heinz Field&#x27;s Sony JumboTron was the largest scoreboard in the NFL. In 2007, ESPN named the &quot;tipping&quot; of the oversized Heinz ketchup bottles atop the scoreboard one of the top ten touchdown celebrations in the NFL.

Ground was broken for Heinz Field on June 18, 1999, at a ceremony co-hosted by the Steelers and the University of Pittsburgh. The stadium was constructed by Hunt Construction Group and Mascaro Construction Company, LP. The two companies directed 1,400 workers over two years, in which there were no construction accidents or lawsuits. The stadium is inspected yearly, along with PNC Park, by Chronicle Consulting, LLC, for structural defects and maintenance.

===Opening===

The first event held at Heinz Field was a concert hosted by &#x27;N Sync on August 18, 2001. Coincidentally, they were also the last band to perform at the Steelers&#x27; previous home, Three Rivers Stadium. Before the Steelers&#x27; regular season, the team played a pre-season game against the Detroit Lions on August 25, 2001. Pittsburgh won the stadium&#x27;s unofficial opening game 20–7, before 57,829 spectators. The first official football game played in the stadium was between the Pittsburgh Panthers and East Tennessee State, on September 1. The Panthers won the game 31–0, with quarterback David Priestley scoring the first touchdown on an 85-yard run. The Steelers were scheduled to open the regular season play at Heinz Field on September 16 against the Cleveland Browns; however, due to the September 11 attacks, all NFL games of the week were postponed, thus moving the stadium&#x27;s premiere to October 7, against the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to the game, a speech from US President George W. Bush, ordering attacks on Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, was shown live on the stadium&#x27;s JumboTron. The speech was met with much applause and support from the spectators in attendance. Pittsburgh defeated the Bengals, 16–7. Steelers kicker Kris Brown scored the first NFL points in the stadium on a 26-yard field goal, and quarterback Kordell Stewart scored the first touchdown on an eight-yard run.

That same year, two light-emitting diode (LED) video displays from Daktronics were installed at the field. The larger, HD video display measures approximately high by nearly wide.

In 2007, writer Bill Evans named Heinz Field the second best stadium in the NFL, behind Lambeau Field, in an article for ESPN.com. Although both stadiums received a score of 54 out of 70, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Heinz Field the second best stadium in the NFL, also behind Lambeau Field.

===Future===

While the Steelers continue to make capital improvements to Acrisure Stadium as well as expand seating, some fans of the Pitt Panthers football team have called for the university to build an on-campus stadium. However, the university has never included such plans in any long-term facilities or strategic planning. While there has been talk of extending the Pittsburgh Light Rail to Oakland, significant costs were cited during construction of the North Shore Connector, which terminates at Acrisure Stadium. While the possibility of moving games back on campus with a purpose-built stadium has not been entirely dismissed by the university administration, it has also not been endorsed or featured in any strategic planning.

In January 2021, just as the Heinz naming rights deal was set to expire, it was announced that Kraft-Heinz decided to renew the naming rights for just one more year, ensuring the name would remain through at least the end of 2021. As the naming rights were allowed to expire in 2022, the future name of the stadium was uncertain. However, Steelers president Art Rooney II has said he was &quot;optimistic&quot; about agreeing to another extension with Kraft-Heinz.

However, on July 10, 2022, it was reported that Heinz would not sign a new deal with the Steelers, ending their 21-year business arrangement. After unsuccessfully trying to find another local company to purchase the naming rights, the naming rights were bought by Michigan-based insurance company Acrisure in a deal initially reported on July 11, 2022; Steelers minority owner Thomas Tull also has an ownership stake in Acrisure. The decision to rename the stadium has received overwhelmingly fierce opposition by Steelers fans.

However, Kraft-Heinz did not remain outside of Steelers-named sponsorship for much longer after giving up naming rights to the stadium itself; the company renegotiated with the Steelers to instead be the naming sponsor for Gate C, the closest gate to the Allegheny Light Rail station. Kraft Heinz later repurposed the Heinz Field name for the new football stadium for Aliquippa Junior/Senior High School in suburban Aliquippa, Pennsylvania as part of a $1.3 million endowment to the Aliquippa School District for new academic and athletic centers.

==Notable events==
In addition to football games, Acrisure Stadium has hosted other various activities.

===Football===
On August 4, 2012, Heinz Field hosted the Women&#x27;s Football Alliance&#x27;s National Championship Game, becoming the first NFL stadium to host a title game for any women&#x27;s football league.

The quickest score in NFL history occurred on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety on the opening kickoff three seconds into the game. Darius Reynaud of the Titans fielded the kickoff and took a short step backwards (into the south end zone) for what was ruled to be a safety, not a touchback, because the ball was not in the end zone when it was fielded. The Steelers, however, lost the game 16–9, which was also their first home opener loss since the stadium opened.

On October 7, 2018, the Steelers won their 100th regular season game at Heinz Field with a record of 100–38–1 at that point.

College football

Since the Panthers moved to the stadium, attendance for games has been varied, ranging from an average high of 59,197 people per game for the 2003 season to a low of 33,315 in 2007. Speculation and analysis mostly concluded that that attendance was primarily impacted by the success of the team and times that the games are played, not the location of the stadium. More recently, Pitt has averaged 54,710 in home attendance during the 2022 season in which the team posted a 9-4 record and 48,122 during the 2023 season in which the team recorded a 3-9 season.

On September 1, 2022, the Backyard Brawl between the University of Pittsburgh and West Virginia University met after an 11-year break of the rivalry, due to conference realignment. With an attendance of 70,622 fans, a new record was set for the largest sporting event in the history of Pittsburgh. The previous record was held by Penn State versus Pitt in 2016 with 69,983 in attendance.

===Concerts===
Since its opening in 2001, bands and artists including NSYNC, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Kenny Chesney, and LeAnn Rimes have performed at the stadium. Additionally, hometown bands The Clarks and the Povertyneck Hillbillies have played multiple shows at the stadium.

===Soccer===
On July 27, 2014, Heinz Field hosted a soccer match between A.C. Milan and Manchester City which was part of the 2014 International Champions Cup and Manchester City won the match 5–1.

Heinz Field hosted a women&#x27;s international exhibition match between the United States and Costa Rica on August 16, 2015. It ended in an 8–0 victory for the United States, in their first match since winning the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and set a new attendance record for a standalone women&#x27;s friendly in the U.S. with 44,028 spectators.

===NHL Winter Classic===

On May 28, 2010, National Hockey League commissioner Gary Bettman announced that Heinz Field would be the host of the 2011 NHL Winter Classic. The game was played January 1, 2011, between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Washington Capitals. Pittsburgh native Jackie Evancho sang the Star Spangled Banner before local sports legends Franco Harris, Jerome Bettis, and Mario Lemieux dropped the ceremonial puck. The Capitals won, 3–1. The game was the highest rated NHL contest since 1996 and the highest rated regular season game since 1975. It was also the first night Classic and the first to use &quot;CableCam&quot; technology.
===In film &amp; TV===
Pittsburgh was one of six cities chosen for the 2011 &quot;American Idol&quot; auditions chose Pittsburgh of one of six cities and scheduled signups at Heinz Field on July 12–13 and auditions on July 15, 2011.

Heinz Field was the home field for the Gotham Rogues in the 2012 film &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot;. An estimated 15,000 unpaid extras filled the stadium during shooting on August 6, 2011. During episode 4 of season 12 of &quot;The Bachelorette&quot;, eleven contestants competed in a five-on-five football game. In addition, they met with football players from the Steelers including Ben Roethlisberger, Hines Ward, and Brett Keisel.

===Other events===
In 2002, the Pittsburgh Marathon ended at Heinz Field; the course was altered from past years allowing competitors to cross the finish line on the field. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Wine Festival was held at Heinz Field and over 2,000 people attended.

In 2021, Pittsburgh CLO presented a production of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; from July 8 to 10 on the field. In 2024, President Donald J. Trump visited the stadium for a Steelers game during his presidential campaign.

In 2025, the stadium will host Supercross for the first time ever, as well as Monster Jam.

==Features==
===Playing surface===
In June 2001, Kentucky Bluegrass was laid on the field, at half the height of most NFL field&#x27;s grass. The field is heated from below, using a mixture of antifreeze and hot water, to keep the field at around 62°F (17°C) in order to keep the grass growing year-round. The field was re-surfaced multiple times, until the synthetic-enhanced Desso GrassMaster was installed in 2003. Debate continued over the surface after players began slipping during game play. Despite this, players and coaches of Pitt, the Steelers, and their opponents supported keeping the current turf.


On Friday, November 23, 2007, Heinz Field hosted four WPIAL championship football games which were followed the day after with a game between Pitt and South Florida. After discussion with the NFL, the Steelers owners decided to re-surface the field for their nationally televised game against the Miami Dolphins. A layer of sod was laid on the GrassMaster surface. After the new sod was laid, 1½ inches of rain fell which did not allow the tarp to be removed from the field until 70 minutes before the game began. The field conditions were so bad that a punt by Dolphins punter Brandon Fields stuck to the turf without bouncing. The Steelers won the game 3–0, with a field goal by Jeff Reed with 17 seconds remaining; it was the NFL&#x27;s first 3–0 game since 1993 and the longest two teams went without scoring since the New York Giants and Detroit Lions played to a scoreless tie on November 11, 1943. Scott Brown, of the &quot;Pittsburgh Tribune-Review&quot;, called the field a &quot;veritable mud pit&quot;. Gene Upshaw, head of the National Football League Players&#x27; Association, said a 2006 survey of NFL players ranked Heinz Field as the second-worst field in the league. Steelers receiver Hines Ward called the playing conditions &quot;horrendous&quot; after the game. However, the following day Ward and other Pittsburgh players lobbied to keep the natural surface, saying, &quot;I think everybody wants to keep the grass.&quot; Since that season, the Steelers have played their game on the weekend after Thanksgiving on the road at the team&#x27;s request.

Debate continued over the field later in the season when Jacksonville running back Fred Taylor called the field &quot;a lawsuit pending&quot;. Pittsburgh&#x27;s owners said the decision was up to the players, who once again defended the natural surface. In February 2008, the Steelers announced that they would keep the Desso GrassMaster surface. During the 2008 season, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger received a concussion from a hit at Heinz Field. He later said, &quot;I&#x27;m glad we weren&#x27;t on FieldTurf. That grass — you know, the soft Heinz Field—might&#x27;ve helped a little bit.&quot; After the 2008 season, a poll of 1,565 NFL players rated the surface at Heinz Field as the worst of the 18 natural surfaces in the League.

The Grassmaster surface was removed in January 2009 and replaced with the old sod placed on top of the Grassmaster surface for the AFC Championship later that month.

===Field design===

When the venue opened in 2001, both end zones were painted athletic gold during Steelers home games (this also happened for the final five seasons at Three Rivers Stadium), with &quot;PITTSBURGH&quot; on the north side and &quot;Steelers&quot; on the south side; both words were painted black with white outlines. Either &quot;Steelers&quot; or &quot;Panthers&quot; was painted in the end zone, depending on the game, during the first three years. For the 2002 Steelers regular season, the area covered by gold paint was reduced to just around the words. The design for the 2002 Wild Card matchup replaced the white letter outlines with athletic gold paint and removed it everywhere else.

In 2003, the Steelers played the Philadelphia Eagles in a preseason game with plain diagonal white lines in the South end zone, which were common in NFL end zones until the 1960s. Although the Steelers lost the game 21–16, team president Dan Rooney liked the look of the South end zone being &quot;plain&quot;, and decided to bring it back the next year. The 2003 season was the last year to date which contained &quot;PITTSBURGH&quot; and &quot;Steelers&quot; in black words with athletic gold outlines in both end zones.

Beginning in 2004, the wordmark designs were flipped in paint color, &quot;PITTSBURGH&quot; in the North and &quot;Steelers&quot; in the South were now athletic gold with the former having either dark blue outlines for Pitt or black for the Steelers. The diagonal white lines in the South end zone during the college portion of the season began in this year too, with &quot;Steelers&quot; being added after Pitt has played their final home game of the year. In the aforementioned Dolphins-Steelers Monday Night Football match of 2007, the surface conditions had become so deteriorated from the rain and gameplay itself that the field grid of hash marks, yard lines, mid-field logo, and wordmarks in both end zones were barely visible throughout the game. Sideline hash marks (painted orange) and yard lines were re-painted at halftime.

From 2001 through 2010, there was typically no midfield logo when both Pitt and the Steelers were in season; the Steelers had their logo painted on the sidelines when Pitt&#x27;s football season was ongoing and transferred it to midfield after Pitt&#x27;s football season ended (except for the first two seasons when it was only added for the postseason). As of the 2011 season, Pitt and the Steelers in cooperation have their respective logos at midfield for their own homes games, being interchanged frequently.

Being a member of the American Football Conference (AFC), the grounds crew of Acrisure Stadium has painted the conference logo in both end zones for every Pittsburgh Steelers postseason home game to date. Recently, after the end of the Pittsburgh Panthers season, fans and players, including T.J. Watt and J.J. Watt, spoke out to change the endzones to the gold ones, similar to the one at Three Rivers Stadium.

===Seating and tickets===
As of 2018, the Pittsburgh Steelers have sold out every home game since the 1972 season. Entering the 2008 season, the Steelers average ticket price of $69.47 was the 15th highest out of the NFL&#x27;s 32 teams. The majority of the 65,050 seats are colored &quot;Steeler gold&quot;, though club seats are dark gray. Acrisure Stadium features 1,500 seats in 129 luxury boxes, with prices ranging from $64,000 to $135,000 depending on location and size. These boxes were predicted to increase the Steelers&#x27; profits from $10 to $11 million per season over those at Three Rivers Stadium. The stadium also features 6,600 club seats that include a restaurant and an indoor bar, at prices up to $2,000 per person. For the 2010 season, season ticket prices for Panthers games ranged from a maximum of $295 per club seat with required donations per seat between $250 and $500 depending on location, to as low as $87 per seat with no required donation for upper end zone sections. Individual game ticket prices ranged from $30 to $65 depending on the seat location and the opponent.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall spans approximately on the east side of the stadium and houses a collection of Steelers and Pittsburgh Panthers memorabilia. The Hall includes a timeline of the Steelers franchise&#x27;s major events and an oversized Steelers helmet hanging from the ceiling beside a video screen that shows entertainment for fans throughout game days. The Great Hall also features the actual lockers of several former Steelers, including Hall of Fame members Franco Harris, Joe Greene, and Bill Dudley.

Six large Lombardi Trophy-shaped display columns were erected and contain artifacts from each championship the Steelers have won including replica trophies. Two display columns are dedicated to the University of Pittsburgh and contain memorabilia from the Panthers&#x27; teams. The floor is painted to resemble the post-baseball season football field at Three Rivers Stadium, with the word &quot;Steelers&quot; painted in black over a gold background. University of Pittsburgh players are featured on two large murals within the Hall. Eight additional tile murals created by local high schools represent western Pennsylvania football history. In 2007, the Great Hall was named the best concourse at an NFL stadium by writer Bill Evans, in an article for ESPN.com.

==Seating expansion==
The Steelers notified the Pittsburgh Stadium Authority in December 2010 of their intention to add up to 4,000 seats to the lower southern end of the stadium. The plan would increase seating up to 69,050 as soon as the 2012 NFL season. Seating was added in that section for the 2011 NHL Winter Classic, which had an attendance of 68,111. The temporary seating was left in place for the 2010–11 NFL playoffs, with the AFC Championship game on January 23 having a record attendance of 66,662.

On April 12, 2012, the Steelers confirmed they would seek approval from the NFL to expand seating by 3,000. On May 19, 2014, after more than two years, the Steelers and the SEA came to an agreement to add about 3,000 seats to the venue. After contractors surveyed the complex the final number of 2,390 added seats with five additional suites including more parking, restrooms and concessions was determined in December 2014 to increase capacity to a total of 68,400. The seating was put in place by the summer of 2015.

On September 10, 2016, the then-largest crowd of 69,983 to ever see a sporting event in Pittsburgh watched the Pitt Panthers defeat the Penn State Nittany Lions, 42–39 as they renewed their rivalry in football. On September 1, 2022, a crowd of 70,622 fans broke the record attendance for a sporting event in Pittsburgh again, as No. 17 Pitt defeated the West Virginia Mountaineers 38–31 in the first Backyard Brawl since 2011.

==Transportation access==

<text>Sir John Fielding (16 September 1721 – 4 September 1780) was an English magistrate and social reformer of the 18th century. He was the younger half-brother of novelist, playwright and chief magistrate Henry Fielding. Despite being blinded in an accident at the age of 19, John set up his own business and, in his spare time, studied law with Henry.

==Early life==
John Fielding was born on 16 September 1721, most likely in Blenheim Street, St James&#x27;s, London. He was the third child of Lieutenant-General Edmund Fielding and his second wife Anne Blanchard. Fielding&#x27;s mother had previously been married to an Italian named Rapha and may have been the owner of an &quot;eating house&quot; in London. Among Fielding&#x27;s half-siblings were Henry Fielding and Sarah Fielding, with whom he had close relationships, both products of his father&#x27;s first marriage

Very little is known about Fielding&#x27;s childhood and early life; it is possible that he spent some time in service with the Royal Navy. He had poor eyesight, and in 1740 was undergoing treatment from a surgeon named James Wilkie when as a result of Wilkie&#x27;s negligence Fielding was blinded. In the following year Wilkie was forced to pay £500 in damages to Fielding.

==Career==
Fielding joined with his brother Henry and several others in February 1750 to create the University Register Office. The aim of the organisation was to be an intermediary for business transactions in order to &quot;bring the World...together&quot;, however over time it changed focus to function as an employment exchange and seller of &quot;Glastonbury water&quot;. The business was based on the Strand and Fielding lived at the premises as manager.

Appointed Henry&#x27;s personal assistant in 1750, John helped him to root out corruption and improve the competence of those engaged in administering justice in London. They formed the first professional police force, the Bow Street Runners. Through the regular circulation of a police gazette containing descriptions of known criminals, Fielding also established the basis for the first police criminal records department.

When Henry died in 1754, John was appointed magistrate at Bow Street in his place, becoming renowned as the &quot;Blind Beak&quot;, and allegedly being able to recognize three thousand criminals by the sounds of their voices. He also continued to develop his ideas on crime prevention and youth employment, helping to found the Asylum for Orphan Girls in Lambeth in 1758. He was knighted in 1761.

==Personal life==
Fielding married Elizabeth Whittingham of Lichfield, the daughter of a reverend doctor, on 21 November 1751 at a chapel on Duke Street, St James&#x27;s. The couple did not have any children but Elizabeth&#x27;s niece Mary Anne Whittingham lived with them, choosing to also adopt Fielding&#x27;s surname. She married Allen, the son of Fielding&#x27;s brother Henry. Elizabeth died in 1774 and on 6 August the same year Fielding married again, this time to Mary Sedgley of Brompton, at the parish church of Kensington. Fielding again had no children with his wife, who outlived him, dying in 1794.

<text>The Human Genome Organisation (HUGO) is a non-profit organization founded in 1988. HUGO represents an international coordinating scientific body in response to initiatives such as the Human Genome Project. HUGO has four active committees, including the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC), and the HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS).

==History==
HUGO was established at the first meeting on genome mapping and sequencing at Cold Spring Harbor in 1988. The idea of starting the organization stemmed from South African biologist Sydney Brenner, who is best known for his significant contributions to work on the genetic code and other areas of molecular biology, as well as winning the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

A Founding Council was elected at the meeting with a total of 42 scientists from 17 different countries, with Victor A. McKusick serving as founding President. In 2016, HUGO was located at the EWHA Womans University in Seoul, South Korea. In 2020, the HUGO headquarters moved to Farmington, Connecticut, US.

HUGO has convened a Human Genome Meeting (HGM) every year since 1996.

In partnership with geneticist Yuan-Tsong Chen and Alice Der-Shan Chen, founders of the Chen Foundation, HUGO presents the Chen Award to those with research accomplishments in human genetics and genomics in Asia Pacific.

In 2020, HUGO merged with the Human Genomic Variation Society (HGVS) and Human Variome Project (HVP).

== HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society ==

HUGO&#x27;s Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS) is an interdisciplinary academic working group that is a uniquely positioned to analyse bioethical matters in genomics at a conceptual level and with an international perspective. To this end, CELS mission is to explore and inform professional discourse on the ethical aspects of genetics and genomics, normally though scholarly engagement, thought-provoking papers, and policy guiding statements.

The first meeting of the HUGO Ethics Committee took place in Amsterdam in October 1992, chaired by Nancy Wexler (Columbia University). In 2010, under the leadership of then HUGO president Edison Liu (The Jackson Laboratory) and a new chair Ruth Chadwick (Cardiff University), the committee became the HUGO Committee on Ethics, Law and Society (CELS). Benjamin Capps was nominated to be the present chair at the HUGO Human Genome Meeting, held in Barcelona in 2017.

<doc id="626718" wikidata="Q1068646" url="?curid=626718" title="Yoga Sutras of Patanjali">
<text>The Yoga Sutras of Patañjali (IAST: Patañjali yoga-sūtra) is a compilation &quot;from a variety of sources&quot; of Sanskrit sutras (aphorisms) on the practice of yoga – 195 sutras (according to Vyāsa and Krishnamacharya) and 196 sutras (according to others, including BKS Iyengar). The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; were compiled in India in the early centuries CE by the sage Patanjali, who collected and organized knowledge about yoga from Samkhya, Buddhism, and older Yoga traditions, and possibly another compiler who may have added the fourth chapter. He may also be the author of the &quot;Yogabhashya&quot;, a commentary on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, traditionally attributed to the legendary Vedic sage Vyasa, but possibly forming a joint work of Patanjali called the &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot;. 

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; draw from three distinct traditions from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE, namely Samkhya, Buddhism traditions, and &quot;various older ascetic and religious strands of speculation.&quot; The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; built on Samkhya notions of &quot;purusha&quot; and &quot;prakriti&quot;, and is often seen as complementary to it. It is closely related to Buddhism, incorporating some of its terminology. While there is &quot;an apparent lack of unity and coherence,&quot; according to Larson there is a straightforward unity to the text, which focuses on &quot;one-pointed awareness&quot; (&quot;ekagrata&quot;) and &quot;content-free awareness&quot; (&quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot;); the means to acquire these, namely kriya yoga (&quot;action yoga&quot;) and ashtanga yoga (eight-limb yoga); the results acquired from the attainment of these levels of awareness; and the final goal of yoga, namely &quot;kaivalya&quot; and liberation.

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; is best known for its sutras on &quot;ashtanga yoga&quot;, eight elements of practice culminating in &quot;samadhi&quot;. The eight elements, known as limbs, are &quot;yama&quot; (abstinences), &quot;niyama&quot; (observances), &quot;asana&quot; (yoga posture), &quot;pranayama&quot; (breath control), &quot;pratyahara&quot; (withdrawal of the senses), &quot;dharana&quot; (concentration of the mind), &quot;dhyana&quot; (meditation) and &quot;samadhi&quot; (absorption or stillness). When the mind is stilled (&quot;vritti nirodha&quot;) &quot;kaivalya&quot; (&quot;isolation&quot;) can be attained, the discenrment of &quot;purusha&quot; (pure consciousness, self, the witness-consciousness) as distinct from &quot;prakriti&quot; (nature, the cognitive apparatus and the instincts).

The contemporary Yoga tradition holds the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patañjali&quot; to be one of the foundational texts of classical Yoga philosophy. However, the appropriation – and misappropriation – of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; and its influence on later systematizations of yoga has been questioned by David Gordon White, who argues that the text fell into relative obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and made a comeback in the late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda, the Theosophical Society and others. It gained prominence as a classic in the 20th century.

==Author and dating==

===Author===
The colophons of manuscripts of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; attribute the work to Patanjali, though according to Larson chapter 4 is a later addition, and cannot be attributed to Patanjali.

The identity of Patañjali has been the subject of academic debate, because an author of the same name is credited with the authorship of the classic text on Sanskrit grammar named &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot;, that is firmly datable to the second century BCE. Although some scholars argue that this is the same Patanjali who authored the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;, the two works are completely different in subject matter, and Indologist Louis Renou has shown that there are significant differences in language, grammar and vocabulary. Before the time of Bhoja (11th century), no known text conflates the identity of the two authors.

===Dating===
The text has been variously dated to be between 500 BCE and 450 CE, but latter dates are more commonly accepted by scholars.

Philipp A. Maas assessed Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot;&#x27;s date to be about 400 CE, based on synchronisms between its arguments and those of Vasubandhu, on tracing the history of the commentaries on it published in the first millennium CE, on the opinions of earlier Sanskrit commentators, on the testimony of manuscript colophons and on a review of extant literature. This dating for the &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot; was proposed as early as 1914 by Woods and has been accepted widely by academic scholars of the history of Indian philosophical thought.

Edwin Bryant surveyed the major commentators in his translation of the &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot;. He observed that &quot;Most scholars date the text shortly after the turn of the Common Era (circa first to second century), but that it has been placed as early as several centuries before that.&quot; Bryant concluded that &quot;A number of scholars have dated the &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot; as late as the fourth or fifth century CE, but these arguments have all been challenged [...] All such arguments [for a late date] are problematic.&quot;

Michele Desmarais summarized a wide variety of dates assigned to Yogasutra, ranging from 500 BCE to 3rd century CE, noting that there is a paucity of evidence for any certainty. She stated the text may have been composed at an earlier date given conflicting theories on how to date it, but latter dates are more commonly accepted by scholars.

===Text - &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot;===
Scholars hold that the &quot;Yoga sutras&quot; and the &quot;Yogabhasya&quot;, a commentary on the sutras, were written by one person, and form an integral work. According to Philipp A. Maas, based on a study of the original manuscripts, Patañjali&#x27;s composition was entitled &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot; (&quot;The Treatise on Yoga according to Patañjali&quot;) and consisted of both &quot;Sūtras&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;Bhāṣya&quot;. According to Maas and Wujastyk, Patanjali compiled yoga from older traditions in &quot;Pātañjalayogaśāstra&quot;, and added his own explanatory passages to create the unified work that, since 1100 CE, has been considered the work of two people. The practice of writing a set of aphorisms with the author&#x27;s own explanation was well known at the time of Patañjali, as for example in Vasubandhu&#x27;s &quot;Abhidharmakośabhāṣya&quot; (that, incidentally, Patañjali quotes). These research findings change the historical understanding of the yoga tradition, since they allow us to take the Bhāṣya as Patañjali&#x27;s very own explanation of the meaning of his somewhat cryptic sūtras. This commentary is indispensable for the understanding of the aphoristic and terse Yoga sutras, and the study of the sutras has always referred to the &quot;Yogabhashya&quot;. 

While the &quot;Yogabhashya&quot; was probably written by Patanjali, it has traditionally also attributed to the legendary Vedic sage Vyasa who is said to have composed the Mahabharata. The &quot;bhasya&quot; has also been attributed by some to Vindhyavasin (late 4th century CE), who reinterpreted the samkhya-philosophy due to his knowledge of Buddhist philosophy; his reinterpretation is closely related to the &quot;Yogabhasya&quot;, which builts on this reinterpretation.

===Compilation of sources===

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are a compilation of sutras from various traditions and sources, with &quot;an apparent lack of unity and coherence.&quot; 

Larson notes that Yoga, Buddhism, Jainism and Ajivika share related origins, and argues that the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; draw from three distinct traditons from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE, namely &quot;(1) one or more Samkhya traditions, (2) one or more Buddhist traditions, and (3) an emerging philosophical Yoga tradition that is compiling various older ascetic and religious strands of speculation.&quot; Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras may be a &quot;hybrid formulation, a conflation&quot; of these three traditions. From the old Samkhya philosophy the Yoga Sutras adopt the &quot;reflective discernment&quot; (&quot;adhyavasaya&quot;) of &quot;prakrti&quot; and &quot;purusa&quot;, its metaphysical rationalism, and its three epistemic methods to gaining reliable knowledge. From Buddhism the sutras adopt the &quot;nirodhasamadhi&quot; philosophy, the pursuit of altered states of awareness and an ontology of &#x27;naive realism&#x27; (Sarvastivada) or representationalism (Yogacara). Like Samkhya, the Yoga sutras are physicalist or materialist, but unlike Samkhya, &quot;it rigorusly rejects any notion of substantive transcendence.&quot; The third stream that the Yoga Sutras conflate are elements of older traditions of ascetic meditation, including &quot;the &quot;kriya yoga&quot; sections of Book Two (YS II.1-27), the &quot;yoganga&quot; sections of Books II and III (YS II.28-III.55), some &quot;karma yoga&quot; sections in Book IV (YS IV.7-13), and various sutras having to do with the issue of God (&quot;isvara-pranidhana&quot;). According to Larson, &quot;many of these strands come probably from contexts such as the &quot;Moksadharma&quot; and &quot;Bhagavadgita&quot; portions of the epic, some passages from the early &quot;Puranas&quot;, the socalled middle verse Upanisads (Katha, Svetasvata and Maitri, and from oral traditions of regional teachers and any number of local &quot;asramas&quot;.

===Structure of the text===

Beginning in the early 20th century, scholars have dissceted the sutras into the constitutive layers. Book I consists of two texts, I.1 or I.2 to I.16 or I.22, the remainder of the book forming a second text. Book II.1-27 is the Kriya yoga text, while Book II.28-III.55 describes astanga yoga. Hauer regards Book IV as one text, treating &quot;nirmanacitta&quot; (&quot;individual mind&quot;), while Deusse discerns four &quot;appendices,&quot; namely IV.1-6 (&quot;nirmanacitta&quot;, &quot;individual mind&quot;), IV.7-13 (&quot;karman&quot;, action, and &quot;vasana&quot;, subtle traces), IV.14-23 (&quot;vastu&quot;, reality, &quot;citta&quot;, mind, and &quot;purusa&quot;) and IV.24-33 (&quot;kaivalya&quot;, release).

Frauwallner discerns two main traditions, namely the astangha yoga of Book II and III, which aims to attain &quot;mental alertness and clarity,&quot; and the &quot;way of suppression of mental functioning&quot; of Book I. Frauwallner rejects Book IV as a later addition.

According to Feuerstein, presupposing an inherent homegeinity of the text, the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are a condensation of two different traditions, namely &quot;eight limb yoga&quot; (aṣṭāṅga yoga) and action yoga (&quot;Kriya yoga&quot;). The &quot;kriya yoga&quot; part is contained in chapter 1, which forms an introduction, chapter 2 sutras 1–27, chapter 3 except sutra 54, and chapter 4. The &quot;eight limb yoga&quot; is described in chapter 2 sutras 28–55, and chapter 3 sutras 3 and 54. According to Feuerstein, the Yoga sutras main component is the Kriya yoga, with astangha yoga forming a &quot;long insert or quotation of an &#x27;Eight-limbed Yoga&#x27;portion.&quot; While Larson is appreciative of Feuerstein&#x27;s attempt to treat the Yoga sutras as an unifirm text, he also notes that &quot;it is doubtfull that most researchers would concede that the YS overal centers on &quot;kriyayoga&quot;.&quot; Scholars seem to agree, though, that the &quot;yoganga&quot;-portion, the eight-limb yoga, is a distinct unit, though there is no agreement as how far it extends into Book III.

Larson takes into account the &quot;Yogabhasya&quot; and Vacaspatimitra&#x27;s commentaries when describing the basic structure of the Yoga sutras. Book I describes levels of awareness relevant for yoga, namely &quot;one-pointed or content-filled awareness and suppressed or content-free awareness, and the means for attaining these levels of awareness: &#x27;practice&#x27; (&quot;abhyasa&quot;) and &#x27;renunciation&#x27; (&quot;vaitagya&quot;). Book II treats practical exercises &quot;needed to train those who have not yet reached&quot; those levels of awareness; these exercises include kriya yoga and the first five limbs of astangha yoga. Book III describes the results acquired from the attainment of these levels of awareness, reuslting from &quot;dharana&quot;, &quot;dhyana&quot; and &quot;samadhi&quot;. Book IV treats the final goal of yoga, namely &quot;kaivalya&quot;, content-free or seedless samadhi, and liberation.

===Other commentaries===

A well-known commentary on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; was written by Vachaspati Mishra, who had also written commentaries on other schools of Indian philosophy such as Vedanta, Samkhya, Nyaya, and Mimamsa. After Vyasa, it is believed that Vachaspati Mishra’s commentary is the &quot;next most authoritative.&quot; Other commentators include Bhoja Rāja, Vijñānabhikṣu, and Rāmānanda Sarasvatī. Vijñānabhikṣu, according to Bryant, wrote the &quot;most insightful and useful commentary after that of Vyasa&#x27;s.&quot; Bhoja Rāja and Rāmānanda Sarasvatī&#x27;s commentaries follow the previous commentaries, without expanding much on what their predecessors have said. Hariharānanda Āraṇya, in contrast to the above figures, is a modern commentator on the text. Bryant explains that, even though &quot;his is a standpoint exposed to Western thought&quot;, it is still &quot;thoroughly grounded in tradition&quot;.

==Contents==

Patañjali divided his &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; into four chapters or books (Sanskrit &quot;Pada&quot;), containing in all 196 aphorisms, divided as follows:

===Book I: Samadhi Pada===

Book 1, &quot;Samadhi Pada&quot;, contains 51 sutras. The &quot;Yogabhashya&quot; states that &#x27;yoga&#x27; in the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; has the meaning of &#x27;samadhi&#x27;. Samadhi is a state of direct and reliable perception (&quot;pramāṇa&quot;) where &quot;the seer&quot; (&quot;Purusha&quot;, pure consciousness, the Self) abides in itself. Samadhi is the main technique the yogi learns by which to calm the workings of the mind, whereafter Kaivalya, the isolation of &#x27;the seer&#x27; from the impurities of the mind, is attained. The author describes yoga and then the nature and the means of attaining samādhi.
* YS 1.2-4: this chapter contains the famous definitional verse (YS 1.2): &quot;Yogaś citta-vritti-nirodhaḥ&quot; (&quot;Yoga is the restriction of the fluctuations of mindstuff&quot;). When the mind is stilled, the seer or real Self is revealed:

::1.3. Then the Seer is established in his own essential and fundamental nature.
::1.4. In other states there is assimilation (of the Seer) with the modifications (of the mind).
* YS 1.12-15: &quot;abhyasa&quot; (practice (of samadhi)) and &quot;vairagya&quot; (dispassion, renunciation) still the mind
* YS 1.17-22: samprajnata [samadhi] and asamprajnata-samadhi
* YS 1.23-26 offers an alternative, less arduous method to attain samadhi via the path of bhakti, or surrender to Ishvara. Some scholars believe this to be Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;favored&quot; approach.
* YS 1.27-32: the syllable &quot;om&quot; and the elimination of distractions
* YS 1.33–39 mentions seven practices to still the mind, the seventh being meditative absorption (YS 1.39), which is further explained in YS 1.40–51 and YS 3.1–12.

===Book II: Sadhana Pada===

Book 2, &quot;Sadhana Pada&quot; contains 55 sutras. Sadhana is the Sanskrit term for &quot;practice&quot; or &quot;discipline,&quot; aiming at preparing and calming the mind. Here the author outlines two systems of Yoga: &quot;Kriyā Yoga&quot; and &quot;Aṣṭāṅga Yoga&quot; (&#x27;Eightlimbed Yoga&#x27;). Both are outer or preparatory aspects, which precede the true aim of yoga, namely the development of one-pointedness and samadhi capable of the discriminative discernment of the Seer (consciousness) from the objects desires of common consciousness.

====Kriya Yoga (II.1-27)====

&quot;Kriya yoga&quot;, or &quot;bhakti&quot;-centered karma yoga, are action-oriented practices, more specific ritual or worship acts, aimed to develop the &quot;sattva&quot;-qualities of the mind, as a preparation for &quot;abhyasa&quot; (practice [of samadhi]) and &quot;vairagya&quot; (dispassion, renunciation). though Larson notes that most scholars would not agree with this assessment. According to Feuerstein, &quot;Kriyā Yoga&quot; is the main component of the Yoga Sūtras, Others see it as a preparation for &quot;Aṣṭāṅga Yoga&quot; (with three special elements of the Niyamas (2nd limb)). It consists of:

* 2.3 &quot;tapas&quot; – austerity
* 2.4 &quot;svādhyāya&quot; – self-study of the scriptures
* 2.5 &quot;īśvara praṇidhāna&quot; – devotion to god or pure consciousness

While comparable to karma-yoga, it is broader than the karma-yoga of the Bhagavad Gita, as it also includes &quot;bhakti&quot; in the form of &quot;īśvara praṇidhāna&quot;, and &quot;jnana-yoga&quot;, in the form of &quot;svādhyāya&quot;.

====Ashtanga Yoga (II.29-III.55)====

&quot;Aṣṭānga Yoga&quot; is the yoga of eight limbs, meaning the elements of the practice. In chapter 2, five &quot;indirect aids&quot; for purification and aiding insight are outlined:

:1. &quot;Yama&quot; – restraints or ethics of behaviour; Yama consists of:
::1.1 &quot;Ahimsa&quot; (Non violence)
::1.2 &quot;Satya&quot; (Truthfulness)
::1.3 &quot;Asteya&quot; (Non stealing)
::1.4 &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; (Chastity)
::1.5 &quot;Aparigraha&quot; (Non possession)
:2. &quot;Niyama&quot; – observances; Niyama consists of:
::2.1 &quot;Saucha&quot; (Cleanliness)
::2.2 &quot;Santosha&quot; (Contentment)
::2.3 &quot;Tapas&quot; (Austerity)
::2.4 &quot;Svadhyaya&quot; (Selfstudy)
::2.5 &quot;Ishvara Pranidhana&quot; (Devotion to the Lord)
:3. &quot;Āsana&quot; – A physical posture in which one can be steady and comfortable.
:4. &quot;Prāṇāyāma&quot; – control of the prana (breath)
:5. &quot;Pratyahara&quot; – withdrawal of the senses
:6. &quot;Dhāraṇā&quot; – concentration
:7. &quot;Dhyāna&quot; – meditation
:8. &quot;Samādhi&quot; – absorption

===Book III: Vibhuti Pada===
* Vibhuti Pada (56 sutras). Vibhuti is the Sanskrit word for &quot;power&quot; or &quot;manifestation&quot;. In chapter 3, the last three limbs of &quot;Aṣṭānga Yoga&quot;, known as samyama, are outlined:
::6. &quot;Dhāraṇā&quot; - concentration
::7. &quot;Dhyāna&quot; – meditation
::8. &quot;Samādhi&quot; – absorption
Besides insight into pure awareness (purusha), samyama gives &#x27;supra-normal powers&#x27; (Sanskrit: &quot;siddhi&quot;), as the yogi gains access to and unites with the tattvas, the constituents of &quot;prakriti&quot;. The text warns (III.38) that these powers can become an obstacle to the yogi who seeks liberation.

===Book IV: Kaivalya Pada===
Book 4, &quot;Kaivalya Pada&quot;, contains 34 sutras, is often regarded as an extraneous adiition. Kaivalya is &quot;isolation&quot; of the Seer from the contents of the mind so it is no longer disturbed by the movements of the mind. It stands for emancipation or liberation, and is used where other texts often employ the term moksha (liberation). The Kaivalya Pada describes the process of liberation and the reality of the Seer.

== Soteriology ==


According to Bryant, the purpose of yoga is liberation from suffering, by means of discriminative discernment. The eight limbs are &quot;the means of achieving discriminative discernment,&quot; the &quot;uncoupling of puruṣa from all connection with prakṛti and all involvement with the citta.&quot; Bryant states that, to Patanjali, Yoga-practice &quot;essentially consists of meditative practices culminating in attaining a state of consciousness free from all modes of active or discursive thought, and of eventually attaining a state where consciousness is unaware of any object external to itself, that is, is only aware of its own nature as consciousness unmixed with any other object.&quot;

While the Samkhya school suggests that &quot;jnana&quot; (knowledge) is a sufficient means to &quot;moksha&quot;, Patanjali suggests that systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya&#x27;s approach to knowledge is the path to moksha. Patanjali holds that &quot;avidya&quot;, ignorance is the cause of all five kleshas, which are the cause of suffering and saṁsāra. Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminating discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The &quot;Yoga Sūtras&quot; is the Yoga school&#x27;s treatise on how to accomplish this. &quot;Samādhi&quot; is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts the process of becoming aware of &quot;Purusa&quot; and true Self. It further claims that this awareness is eternal, and once this awareness is achieved, a person cannot ever cease being aware; this is moksha, the soteriological goal in Hinduism.

Book 3 of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yogasutra&quot; is dedicated to soteriological aspects of yoga philosophy. Patanjali begins by stating that all limbs of yoga are a necessary foundation to reaching the state of self-awareness, freedom and liberation. He refers to the three last limbs of yoga as &quot;samyama&quot;, in verses III.4 to III.5, and calls it the technology for &quot;discerning principle&quot; and mastery of &quot;citta&quot; and self-knowledge. In verse III.12, the Yogasutras state that this discerning principle then empowers one to perfect &quot;sant&quot; (tranquility) and &quot;udita&quot; (reason) in one&#x27;s mind and spirit, through intentness. This leads to one&#x27;s ability to discern the difference between &quot;sabda&quot; (word), &quot;artha&quot; (meaning) and &quot;pratyaya&quot; (understanding), and this ability empowers one to compassionately comprehend the cry/speech of all living beings. Once a yogi reaches this state of &quot;samyama&quot;, it leads to unusual powers, intuition, self-knowledge, freedoms and kaivalya, the redemptive goal of the yogi.

==Philosophy==

=== Epistemology ===

The epistemology in Patanjali&#x27;s system of Yoga, like the Sāmkhya school of Indian philosophy, relies on three of six &quot;Pramanas&quot;, as the means of gaining reliable knowledge. These included &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; (perception), &quot;Anumāṇa&quot; (inference) and &quot;Sabda&quot; (&quot;Āgama or Āptavacana&quot;, word/testimony of reliable sources).

Patanjali&#x27;s system, like the Samkhya school, considers &quot;Pratyakṣa&quot; or &quot;Dṛṣṭam&quot; (direct sense perception), &quot;Anumāna&quot; (inference), and &quot;Śabda&quot; or &quot;Āptavacana&quot; (verbal testimony of the sages or shāstras) to be the only valid means of knowledge or &quot;Pramana&quot;. Unlike few other schools of Hinduism such as Advaita Vedanta, Yoga did not adopt the following three &quot;Pramanas&quot;: &quot;Upamāṇa&quot; (comparison and analogy), &quot;Arthāpatti&quot; (postulation, deriving from circumstances) or &quot;Anupalabdi&quot; (non-perception, negative/cognitive proof).

Of the three &quot;pramanas&quot; that it accepts as valid, &quot;pratyakṣa&quot; (perception) is the most important according to &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;. It is superior to the other two sources because testimony (&quot;sabda&quot;) and inference (&quot;anumāna&quot;) are ultimately dependent on a prior perception. Bryant distinguishes Yoga school from the &quot;Vedānta&quot;, &quot;Nyaya&quot; and &quot;Mīmāṃsā&quot; in their prioritizing of different &quot;pramanas&quot;. The &quot;Mīmāṃsā&quot; school prioritizes testimony and the &quot;Nyaya&quot; school prioritizes inference. The &quot;Vedānta&quot; school has as its main source testimony from the &quot;Upaniṣads&quot;, whereas the Yoga school ascribes supreme authoritativeness to &quot;direct, personal experience&quot;. Bryant argues that because of its favoring of direct experience the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; will &quot;remain a perennial source of interest to the empirical dispositions of the modern world&quot;.

===Samkhya-dualism===

The metaphysics of Patanjali is built on the same dualist foundation as the Samkhya school. The universe is conceptualized as of two realities in Samkhya-Yoga schools: &quot;Puruṣa&quot; (consciousness) and &quot;prakriti&quot; (mind, cognition, emotions, and matter). It considers consciousness and matter, self/soul and body as two different realities. &quot;Jiva&quot; (a living being) is considered as a state in which &quot;puruṣa&quot; is bonded to &quot;prakriti&quot; in some form, in various permutations and combinations of various elements, senses, feelings, activity and mind. During the state of imbalance or ignorance, one of more constituents overwhelm the others, creating a form of bondage. The end of this bondage is called Kaivalya, liberation, or &quot;moksha&quot; by both Yoga and Samkhya school. The ethical theory of Yoga school is based on Yamas and Niyama, as well as elements of the Guṇa theory of Samkhya.

Patanjali adopts the theory of Guṇa from Samkhya. Guṇas theory states that three &quot;gunas&quot; (innate tendency, attributes) are present in different proportions in all beings, and these three are &quot;sattva&quot; guna (goodness, constructive, harmonious), &quot;rajas&quot; guna (passion, active, confused), and &quot;tamas&quot; guna (darkness, destructive, chaotic). These three are present in every being but in different proportions, and the fundamental nature and psychological dispositions of beings is a consequence of the relative proportion of these three &quot;gunas&quot;. When &quot;sattva&quot; guna predominates in an individual, the qualities of lucidity, wisdom, constructiveness, harmony, and peacefulness manifest themselves; when rajas is predominant, attachment, craving, passion-driven activity and restlessness manifest; and when tamas predominates in an individual, ignorance, delusion, destructive behavior, lethargy, and suffering manifest. The theory underpins the philosophy of mind in the Yoga school of Hinduism.

=== God ===

Patanjali differs from the closely related non-theistic/atheistic Samkhya school by incorporating what some scholars have called a &quot;personal, yet essentially inactive, deity&quot; or &quot;personal god&quot; (Ishvara). Hindu scholars such as the 8th century Adi Sankara, as well as many modern academic scholars describe Yoga school as &quot;Samkhya school with God.&quot;

The &quot;Yogasutras of Patanjali&quot; use the term &quot;Isvara&quot; in 11 verses: I.23 through I.29, II.1, II.2, II.32 and II.45. Ever since the Sutra&#x27;s release, Hindu scholars have debated and commented on who or what is &quot;Isvara&quot;? These commentaries range from defining &quot;Isvara&quot; from a &quot;personal god&quot; to &quot;special self&quot; to &quot;anything that has spiritual significance to the individual&quot;. Whicher states that while Patanjali&#x27;s terse verses can be interpreted both as theistic or non-theistic, Patanjali&#x27;s concept of &quot;Isvara&quot; in Yoga philosophy functions as a &quot;transformative catalyst or guide for aiding the yogin on the path to spiritual emancipation&quot;. Whereas the purusa (spirit, or true self) of the yogin is bound to the prakriti – the material body subject to karmas and kleshas, the special &quot;purusa&quot; called &quot;Isvara&quot; is immaterial and ultimately free.

Patanjali defines &quot;Isvara&quot; (Sanskrit: ईश्वर) in verse 24 of Book 1, as &quot;a special Self/Spirit (पुरुषविशेष, &quot;puruṣa-viśeṣa&quot;).&quot;} This sutra adds the characteristics of &quot;Isvara&quot; as that special Self/Spirit which is unaffected (अपरामृष्ट, &quot;aparamrsta&quot;) by one&#x27;s obstacles/hardships (क्लेश, &quot;klesha&quot;), one&#x27;s circumstances created by past or one&#x27;s current actions (कर्म, &quot;karma&quot;), one&#x27;s life fruits (विपाक, &quot;vipâka&quot;), and one&#x27;s psychological dispositions/intentions (आशय, ashaya).

==Philosophical roots and influences==

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; incorporated the teachings of many other Indian philosophical systems prevalent at the time. According to Zimmer, Samkhya and Yoga are two of several schools of philosophy that originated over the centuries that had common roots in the pre-Aryan cultures and traditions of India. Yet, the orthodox Hindu philosophies of Samkhya, Yoga, Vedānta, as well as the non-orthodox Nastika systems of Jainism and Buddhism can all be seen as representing one stream of spiritual activity in ancient India, in contrast to the Bhakti traditions and Vedic ritualism which were also prevalent at the same time. The Vedanta-Sramana traditions, iconolatry and Vedic rituals can be identified with the Jnana marga, Bhakti marga and the Karma marga respectively that are outlined in the Bhagavad Gita.

===Samkhya===

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are built on a foundation of Samkhya philosophy, and are generally seen as the practice while Samkhya is the theory. The influence of Samkhya is so pervasive in the Sutras that the historian Surendranath Dasgupta went so far as to deny independent categorization to Patañjali&#x27;s system, preferring to refer to it as &quot;Patanjala Samkhya&quot;, similar to the position taken by the Jain writer Haribhadra in his commentary on Yoga. Patañjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; accept the Samkhya&#x27;s division of the world and phenomena into twenty-five tattvas or principles, of which one is &quot;Purusha&quot; meaning Self or consciousness, the others being &quot;Prakriti&quot; (primal nature), &quot;Buddhi&quot; (intellect or will), &quot;Ahamkara&quot; (ego), &quot;Manas&quot; (mind), five &quot;buddhindriyas&quot; (sensory capabilities), five &quot;karmendriyas&quot; (action-capabilities) and ten elements. The second part of the Sutras, the Sadhana, also summarizes the Samkhya perspectives about all seen activity lying within the realm of the three &quot;Gunas&quot; of &quot;Sattva&quot; (illumination), &quot;Rajas&quot; (passion) and &quot;Tamas&quot; (lethargy).

The &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; diverge from early Samkhya by the addition of the principle of Isvara or God, as exemplified by Sutra 1.23 – &quot;Iśvara pranidhãnãt vã&quot;, which is interpreted to mean that surrender to God is one way to liberation. &quot;Isvara&quot; is defined here as &quot;a distinct Consciousness, untouched by afflictions, actions, fruitions or their residue&quot;. In the sutras, it is suggested that devotion to &quot;Isvara&quot;, represented by the mystical syllable Om may be the most efficient method of achieving the goal of Yoga. This syllable Om is a central element of Hinduism, appearing in all the Upanishads, including the earliest Chandogya and Brihadaranyaka Upanishads, and expounded upon in the Mandukya Upanishad.

Another divergence from Samkhya is that while the Samkhya holds that knowledge is the means to liberation, Patañjali&#x27;s Yoga insists on the methods of concentration and active striving. The aim of Yoga is to free the individual from the clutches of the matter, and considers intellectual knowledge alone to be inadequate for the purpose – which is different from the position taken by Samkhya.

However, the essential similarities between the Samkhya and Patañjali&#x27;s system remained even after the addition of the &quot;Isvara&quot; principle, with Max Müller noting that &quot;the two philosophies were in popular parlance distinguished from each other as Samkhya with and Samkhya without a Lord...&quot; The Bhagavad Gita, one of the chief scriptures of Hinduism, is considered to be based on this synthetic Samkhya-Yoga system.

The &quot;Yoga Sūtras of Patañjali&quot; is a foundational text of the Yoga philosophy school of Hinduism.

===Buddhism===

While there are differences between Buddhist tenets and the views presented in the Yoga Sutras, scholars have noted striking similarities between Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras and the teachings in Buddhist texts. The levels of samādhi taught in the text resemble the Buddhist &quot;jhanas&quot;.

Karel Werner writes, &quot;Patanjali&#x27;s system is unthinkable without Buddhism. As far as its terminology goes there is much in the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; that reminds us of Buddhist formulations from the Pāli Canon and even more so from the Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma and from Sautrāntika.&quot; He adds, &quot;upon the whole it [Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga sutras] is more elaborate and summarizes the actual technique of Yoga procedures more exactly than the Buddhist exposition&quot;. However, states Werner, &quot;The Buddha was the founder of his system, even though, admittedly, he made use of some of the experiences he had previously gained under various Yoga teachers of his time. Patanjali is neither a founder nor a leader of a new movement. (...) The ingenuity of his [Patanjali&#x27;s] achievement lies in the thoroughness and completeness with which all the important stages of Yoga practice and mental experiences are included in his scheme, and in their systematic presentation in a succinct treatise.&quot; Werner adds that the ideas of existence and the focus on &quot;Self, Soul&quot; in Patajali&#x27;s Yogasutra are different from the &quot;no Self&quot; precepts of Buddhism.

According to David Gordon White, the language of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; is often closer to &quot;Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit, the Sanskrit of the early Mahayana Buddhist scriptures, than to the classical Sanskrit of other Hindu scriptures&quot;. He adds, historical evidence suggests that yoga philosophical systems influenced, and were influenced by, other philosophical systems in India such as early Buddhism and Jainism. White mentions controversies about the Yoga Sutras. A significant minority of scholars, notes White for example, believes that Vyasa lived a few centuries after Patanjali and his &quot;Hindu-izing&quot; commentary subverted Yoga Sutras&#x27; original &quot;Buddhist&quot; teachings; while the majority scholarly view disagrees with this view.

Scholars also note differences between the conceptual frameworks of the Yoga Sutras and those in Buddhist texts. Robert Thurman writes that Patañjali was influenced by the success of the Buddhist monastic system to formulate his own matrix for the version of thought he considered orthodox. The Yoga Sutra, especially the fourth segment of Kaivalya Pada, contains several polemical verses critical of Buddhism, particularly the Vijñānavāda school of Vasubandhu.

Barbara Miller also notes numerous similarities the difference between Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras and teachings in Buddhist texts:
Miller also notes differences between Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras and teachings in Buddhist texts:
According to Michele Desmarias, Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras accept the concept of a Self or soul behind the operational mind, while Buddhists do not accept such a Self exists. The role of Self is central to the idea of &quot;Saṃyoga&quot;, &quot;Citta&quot;, Self-awareness and other concepts in Chapters 2 through 4 of the Yoga sutras, according to Desmarias.

===Jainism===

The five yamas or the constraints of the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patañjali&quot; bear an uncanny resemblance to the five major vows of Jainism, indicating influence of Jainism. Three other teachings closely associated with Jainism also make an appearance in Yoga: the doctrine of &quot;colours&quot; in karma (lesya); the &quot;Telos&quot; of isolation (kevala in Jainism and Kaivalyam in Yoga); and the practice of nonviolence (ahimsa), though nonviolence (ahimsa) made its first appearance in Indian philosophy-cum-religion in the Hindu texts known as the Upanishads [the Chāndogya Upaniṣad, dated to the 8th or 7th century BCE, one of the oldest Upanishads, has the earliest evidence for the use of the word &quot;Ahimsa&quot; in the sense familiar in Hinduism (a code of conduct). It bars violence against &quot;all creatures&quot; (&quot;sarvabhuta&quot;) and the practitioner of Ahimsa is said to escape from the cycle of metempsychosis/reincarnation (CU 8.15.1). It also names Ahimsa as one of five essential virtues].

==Influence==
The contemporary Yoga tradition holds the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patañjali&quot; to be one of the foundational texts of classical Yoga philosophy. However, the appropriation – and misappropriation – of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; and its influence on later systematizations of yoga has been questioned by David Gordon White, who has argued that the text fell into relative obscurity for nearly 700 years from the 12th to 19th century, and made a comeback in late 19th century due to the efforts of Swami Vivekananda, the Theosophical Society and others. It gained prominence as a classic in the 20th century. Its influence was reaffirmed by James Mallinson.

Before the 20th century, history indicates that the medieval Indian yoga scene was dominated by the various other texts such as the Bhagavad Gita and the Yoga Vasistha, texts attributed to Yajnavalkya and Hiranyagarbha, as well as literature on hatha yoga, tantric yoga and Pashupata Shaivism yoga rather than the &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patañjali&quot;. Much about yoga is written in the Mokṣadharma section of the epic &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;. The members of the Jaina faith had their own, different literature on yoga, and Buddhist yoga stems from pre-Patanjali sources.

Some of the major commentaries on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; were written between the ninth and sixteenth century. After the twelfth century, the school started to decline, and commentaries on Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga philosophy were few. By the sixteenth century Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga philosophy had virtually become extinct. The manuscript of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; was no longer copied, since few read the text, and it was seldom taught.

According to David Gordon White, the popularity of the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; is recent, &quot;miraculously rehabilitated&quot; by Swami Vivekananda after having been ignored for seven centuries. It was with the rediscovery by a British Orientalist in the early 1800s that wider interest in the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; arose in the West. Popular interest arose in the 19th century, when the practice of yoga according to the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; became regarded as the science of yoga and the &quot;supreme contemplative path to self-realization&quot; by Swami Vivekananda, following Helena Blavatsky, president of the Theosophical Society. It has become a celebrated text in the West, states White, because of &quot;Big Yoga – the corporate yoga subculture&quot;.

==Translations and commentaries==

The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; was the most translated ancient Indian text in the medieval era, having been translated into about forty Indian languages and two non-Indian languages: Old Javanese and Arabic.

* In early 11th century, the Persian scholar Al Biruni (973–1050 CE) visited India, lived with Hindus for 16 years, and with their help translated several significant Sanskrit works into Arabic and Persian languages. One of these was Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yogasutras&quot;. His translation included the text and a thitherto unknown Sanskrit commentary. Al Biruni&#x27;s translation preserved many of the core themes of Yoga philosophy of Hinduism, but certain sutras and analytical commentaries were restated making it more consistent with Islamic monotheistic theology. Al Biruni&#x27;s version of Yoga Sutras reached Persia and Arabian peninsula by about 1050 AD.
* The &quot;Yoga Sutras of Patanjali&quot; was translated into Old Javanese by Indonesian Hindus, and the text was called &quot;Dharma Patanjala&quot;. The surviving text has been dated to about 1450 CE; however, it is unclear if this text is a copy of an earlier translation and whether other translations existed in Indonesia. This translation shares ideas found in other Indian translations particularly those in the Śaiva traditions, and some in Al Biruni translation, but it is also significantly different in parts from the 11th century Arabic translation. The most complete copy of the &quot;Dharma Patañjala&quot; manuscript is now held at the Staatsbibliothek in Berlin.

By the early 21st century, scholars had located 37 editions of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; published between 1874 and 1992, and 82 different manuscripts, from various locations in India, Nepal, Pakistan, Europe and the United States, many in Sanskrit, some in different North and South Indian languages. The numerous historical variants show that the text was a living document and it was changed as these manuscripts were transmitted or translated, with some ancient and medieval manuscripts marked with &quot;corrections&quot; in the margin of the pages and elsewhere by unknown authors and for unclear reasons. This has made the chronological study of Yoga school of philosophy a difficult task.

Many commentaries have been written on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot;.

===Medieval commentaries===

Medieval commentaries on the Yoga sutras include:
* Vyasa (AD 4th or 5th Century), as mentioned above, has been attributed authorship of the commentary &quot;Yogabhāṣya&quot;, the first medieval commentary on the Yoga Sutras, and the one upon which all subsequent medieval commentaries were based. However, some scholars have argued that this commentary was written by Patanjali himself.
* Adi Shankara (AD 8th Century) is said to have authored the commentary &quot;Vivaraṇa&quot;, although the authorship of this commentary is debated.
* Vācaspati Miśra (AD 900–980) who composed the commentary &quot;Tattvavaiśāradī&quot;, described as the &quot;most significant early subcommentary&quot;.
* Bhoja Raja&#x27;s &quot;Raja-Martanda&quot;, 11th century.
* Vijnanabhiksu&#x27;s 16th century &quot;Yogabhashyavarttika&quot; or simply &quot;Yogavarttika&quot; (&quot;Explanation of the Commentary on the Yoga Sutras&quot; of Vyasa). The writer was a Vaishnava philosopher and exegete who tried to harmonize Samkhya and Vedanta and held the Bhedabheda view.
* Ramananda Sarasvati&#x27;s &quot;Yogamani-Prabha&quot; (16th century).

===Modern translations and commentary===

Countless commentaries on the &quot;Yoga Sutras&quot; are available today. The &quot;Sutras&quot;, with commentaries, have been published by a number of successful teachers of Yoga, as well as by academicians seeking to clarify issues of textual variation. There are also other versions from a variety of sources available on the Internet. The many versions display a wide variation, particularly in translation. The text has not been submitted in its entirety to any rigorous textual analysis, and the contextual meaning of many of the Sanskrit words and phrases remains a matter of some dispute.

<text>Brodie Castle is a well-preserved Z-plan tower house located about west of Forres, in Moray, Scotland. The castle is a Category A listed building, and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

== The Brodie family ==
The original Z-plan tower house was completed in 1567 by Clan Brodie and was partially burned by fire in 1645 by Lewis Gordon of Clan Gordon, the 3rd Marquis of Huntly. In 1824, architect William Burn was commissioned to convert it into a mansion house in the Scots Baronial style, but these additions were only partially completed and were later remodelled by James Wylson ().

It is widely accepted that the family has been associated with the land on which the castle stands since around 1160, when it is believed that King Malcolm IV gave the land to the family.

Ninian Brodie of Brodie, the castle&#x27;s last resident member of the family, died in 2003. One wing of the castle is available for visitors to hire as holiday accommodation through Sykes Cottages.

== The castle today ==
Architecturally, the castle has a well-preserved 16th-century central keep with two 5-storey towers on opposing corners. The interior of the castle is also well preserved, containing fine antique furniture, Oriental artefacts and impressive ceilings, largely dating from the 17th–19th centuries.

Today the castle and surrounding policies, including a national daffodil collection, are owned by the National Trust for Scotland and are open to the public throughout the year. The castle may be hired for weddings and indoor or outdoor events. 

An ancient Pictish monument known as Rodney&#x27;s Stone can be seen in the castle grounds.

<doc id="626722" wikidata="Q7301669" url="?curid=626722" title="Rebecca Blasband">
<text>Rebecca Blasband (born July 8, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter, screenwriter, and television personality known as a cast member on &quot;The Real World: New York&quot;, the first season of MTV&#x27;s reality television show &quot;The Real World&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Rebecca Blasband was born and raised in New Hope, Pennsylvania, to a psychiatrist father and a German immigrant mother who runs an antique store in Philadelphia, to which her family moved to when Blasband was 13. She attended Tisch School of the Arts at New York University and worked as an actress with playwright David Mamet&#x27;s theater company. Returning to music, she formed a band with Adam Schlesinger, the leader of Ivy, saying of the group&#x27;s sound, &quot;It was sort of Manchester-pop stuff. But after a while I started getting into Bob Dylan and things like that, and my direction kind of changed.&quot;

==Career==
===&quot;The Real World&quot;===

In 1992, Blasband, then 24, was cast in &quot;The Real World: New York&quot;, the first season of MTV&#x27;s long-running reality television series, &quot;The Real World&quot;, for which she was paid $2,500. She learned about the show from an acquaintance who was a casting director for it. 

She was later cast in the 2021 reunion series, &quot;The Real World Homecoming: New York&quot;, in which the original cast were reunited in the same New York loft they originally lived in. After watching a clip from the original series in which Blasband and castmate Kevin Powell got into a heated debate about racism, the two again discussed the topic. Blasband reacted badly to criticisms from other castmates about her views on the topic, and walked off of the show in episode three.

===Musician===
Warner/Chappell Music signed Blasband to a publishing contract and financed an album entitled &quot;The Rebecca Blasband&quot;. This album went unreleased. She moved to Denver, Colorado in March 1995, and has opened for Edwyn Collins. 

In 1997 she released the album &quot;Rapt&quot; on the Mercury label. Despite moderately positive critical reviews the album made no impact. In 2018 she self-released the album &quot;Here&quot;, which received little mainstream attention.

<doc id="626723" wikidata="Q1890465" url="?curid=626723" title="Manitoba Act, 1870">
<text>The Manitoba Act, 1870 () is an act of the Parliament of Canada, and part of the Constitution of Canada, that provided for the admission of Manitoba as the fifth province of Canada.

Receiving royal assent on May 12, 1870, the act also continued to enforce &quot;An Act for the Temporary Government of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territories when united with Canada&quot; upon the absorption of the British territories of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory into Canada on July 15, 1870.

Hoping to decrease tension, the act marked the legal resolution of the fight for self-determination between the federal government and the people (particularly the Métis) of the Red River Colony, which began in 1870 with Canada&#x27;s purchase of Rupert&#x27;s Land.

Many negotiations and uprisings came with this act, some of which are still not settled today. One area of contention was that the Métis people were not familiar with the enforcement of laws, and the concept of deeds and money - this resulted in many Métis people being cheated out of the land that was supposed to be theirs. While the act included protections for the region&#x27;s Métis, these protections were not fully realized and resulted in many Métis leaving the province for the North-West Territories.

==Background==

The Province of Manitoba was previously the area settled by the people of the Red River Colony.

In 1884, Manitoba was organized in many different municipalities. The county of Selkirk, Manitoba happened to be one of the regions that had to be split up for the purpose of creating townships. This area was originally a part of Rupert&#x27;s Land, which was where the fur traders did the majority of their hunting and trapping. Rupert&#x27;s Land was controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company (HBC), the largest fur trading company of its time. In the late 1860s, the HBC surrendered the land to the British Crown, through the &quot;Rupert&#x27;s Land Act 1868&quot;. This caused severe controversy specifically in the area of the Red River Colony:. in the eyes of the British Crown and the Canadian government, the land was seen to be owned by the HBC, even though Indigenous and Métis people lived there. The Canadian government paid £300,000 for Rupert&#x27;s Land, becoming the largest land purchase to date for the Canadian government.

Once the Canadian government claimed the land from the HBC, they began to set up Members of Parliament. William McDougall was appointed to be the Lieutenant Governor of Rupert&#x27;s Land and the North-Western Territory in 1869. In September 1869, McDougall set out to Red River, accompanied by many administrative officers. The Métis were not consulted upon these government actions, thus causing a great amount of uproar and distress.

=== Rise of the Métis ===
The Métis became aware of the new government attempting to control their territory. A popularly elected convention supported the creation of a provisional government.

However, many of the Métis people did not have the ability to understand all the legal action due to a lack of education and experience. As result, Louis Riel was positioned leader for the Métis people, due to his educational experience from his time spent at school training to be a priest and lawyer, even though he never finished his schooling. As the Red River Colony was a bilingual area, Riel&#x27;s ability to speak both French and English was also huge advantage. Riel and his supporters thereby created a provisional government, which was considered illegal by the federal government; this time period is known as the Red River Resistance (or Red River Rebellion).

Riel and the Métis prepared for the arrival of William McDougall and his accompanied administrative officers. Once they arrived at the border of the Red River Colony at the 49th Parallel, they encountered the armed party of the Métis, who denied them entry into the Colony by creating a barrier. McDougall did not give up his efforts at that point, instead staying in Pembina for approximately a month&#x27;s time attempting to control the area. The Métis actions separated the Canadian party due to their barriers, while some were captured and held in jail at Fort Garry. On December 16, McDougall gave up his efforts for the time being. The Canadian government created a new expedition in attempts to establish sovereignty and establish a political solution.

The Red River Resistance started out as a non-violent protest and uprising toward the Canadian government. Riel and his people had occupied Fort Garry. A group of Ontario settlers who were opposed to the Riel uprising set out to the fort. This caused 45 men to be incarcerated in the fort by Riel and his people. While these men were incarcerated a major historical event occurred. A man by the name of Thomas Scott was executed while being held captive at the fort on March 4, 1870. This event has been analysed by many historians because it is hotly disputed why Scott was executed. The execution of Thomas Scott had a great impact on how the Canadian government and its supporters viewed the Métis. People were so outraged that when Riel was to make appearances at Parliament he did not attend in fear of getting himself killed. Despite the execution, the Canadian government was still working towards sovereignty.

The &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; made the Red River Colony a part of Canada and created the province of Manitoba. Even with the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; in place, much work was to be done with the settling of land rights. Before land rights were settled, Sir John A. Macdonald sent a military expedition to Manitoba, led by Colonel Garnet Wolseley. This Red River Expedition became known as the Wolseley expedition. The government portrayed this expedition as non-punitive; however, the militiamen wanted to avenge the death of Thomas Scott. The ensuing chaos and retribution against the Métis population was labelled &quot;The Reign of Terror&quot; by newspapers in eastern Canada and the United States. Many Métis fled to Saskatchewan, while Louis Riel fled to the United States at this time.

=== Government ===
Manitoba entered Confederation as a province. English and French-language rights were safeguarded in the new legislature and the courts, as were Protestant and Roman Catholic educational rights. The right to education in either English or French, however, was not protected.

Ottawa agreed to pay subsidies to the provincial government. Roughly of land (Assiniboia district) were set aside specifically for the betterment of the Métis nation. The province received four seats in the federal Parliament, which was a strong representation considering the small population.

John A. Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier were both leading figures in the establishment of the Province of Manitoba during 1870. These two men shared personal alliances which made their conjunction a strong one when it came to political movements.

== Métis list of rights ==
The Métis have traditionally been known to come from the Red River Colony. In areas such of the Red River Colony, the Métis came as result of many European trappers marrying and having children with the Indigenous women of the area. Throughout the years, the definition of Métis have gone through many changes. Due to this part-European heritage, often being labelled &quot;half-blood&quot; or &quot;half-breeds&quot;, the Métis have struggled with recognition as a distinct Aboriginal people. Métis are not identified under the &quot;Indian Act&quot; of Canada causing a great amount of controversy. As they are not settlers nor are they fully Indigenous, Métis people are known to be &quot;self-identified&quot;.

=== List of rights ===
In the 1990s, there was a separate definition for &#x27;Red River Métis&#x27;, a term created for individuals whose families&#x27; Métis ancestry came from Red River. The Red River Métis were directly involved in many elements of consideration for the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; - some requests were essential to be guaranteed by the Government of Canada in this act, such as the prospect of fishing was deemed to be limited to Métis people only, and that any parties intending to communicate with Métis people must be fluent in French.

Four successive lists of rights were drafted by the provisional government. In summary, the final list demanded that Manitoba be admitted into Confederation as a province, not a territory; that the lieutenant governor of the new province speak both French and English; and that members of the provisional government not face legal consequences for their actions in the Rebellion.

The following is the fourth and final iteration of the list of some of the Red River Métis&#x27; demands for the act.May 9, 1870

# That this province be governed:
## By a Lieutenant-Governor, appointed by the Governor-General of Canada;
## By a Senate;
## By a Legislature chosen by the people with a responsible ministry.
# That, until such time as the increase of the population in this country entitle us to a greater number, we have two representatives in the Senate and four in the Commons of Canada.
# That in entering the Confederation the Province of the Northwest be completely free from the public debt of Canada; and if called upon to assume a part of the said debt of Canada, that it be only after having received from Canada the same amount for which the said Province of the Northwest should be held responsible.
# That the annual sum of $80,000 be allotted by the Dominion of Canada to the Legislature of the Province of the Northwest.
# That all properties, rights and privileges enjoyed by us up to this day be respected, and that the recognition and settlement of customs, usages and privileges be left exclusively to the decision of the Local Legislature.
# That this country be submitted to no direct taxation except such as may be imposed by the local legislature for municipal or other local purposes.
# That the schools be separate, and that the public money for schools be distributed among the different religious denominations in proportion to their respective populations according to the system of the Province of Quebec.
# That the determination of the qualifications of members for the parliament of the province or for the parliament of Canada be left to the local legislature.
# That in this province, with the exception of the Indians, who are neither civilized nor settled, every man having attained the age of 21 years, and every foreigner being a British subject, after having resided three years in this country, and being Possessed of a house, be entitled to vote at the elections for the members of the local legislature and of the Canadian Parliament, and that every foreigner other than a British subject, having resided here during the same period, and being proprietor of a house, be likewise entitled to vote on condition of taking the oath of allegiance. It is understood that this article is subject to amendment, by the local legislature exclusively.
# That the bargain of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company with respect to the transfer of government of this country to the Dominion of Canada, never have in any case an effect prejudicial to the rights of Northwest.
# That the Local Legislature of this Province have full control over all the lands of the Northwest.
# That a commission of engineers appointed by Canada explore the various districts of the Northwest, and lay before the Local Legislature within the space of five years a report of the mineral wealth of the country.
# That treaties be concluded between Canada and the different Indian tribes of the Northwest, at the request and with the co-operation of the Local Legislature.
# That an uninterrupted steam communication from Lake Superior to Fort Garry be guaranteed to be completed within the space of five years, as well as the construction of a railroad connecting the American railway as soon as the latter reaches the international boundary.
# That all public buildings and constructions be at the cost of the Canadian Exchequer.
# That both the English and French languages be common in the Legislature and in the Courts; and that all public documents as well as the acts of the Legislature be published in both languages.
# That the Lieutenant-Governor to be appointed for the province of the Northwest be familiar with both the English and French languages.
# That the Judge of the Supreme Court speak the English and French languages.
# That all debts contracted by the Provisional government of the territory of the Northwest, now called Assiniboia, in consequence of the illegal and inconsiderate measures adopted by Canadian officials to bring about a civil war in our midst, be paid out of the Dominion treasury, and that none of the Provisional government, or any of those acting under them, be in any way held liable or responsible with regard to the movement or any of the actions which led to the present negotiations.
== Guarantees of the act ==

=== Land ===
In the Métis&#x27; favour, the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; guaranteed that the Métis would receive the title for the land that they already farmed and in addition they would receive of farmland for the use of their children. This land was to be divided up through an application process.

The act also set aside land for the Métis, with each family receiving a scrip (a certificate) saying they owned , amounting to a total of about 5600 km2. The number of applications that the government was going to receive was greatly underestimated. The 1.4 million acres of land was not enough for the number of applications. The Canadian government began giving money for land, the equivalent value of $1 per acre, which was the current land value at that time.

Section 31 reads, in part:
=== Religious and language rights ===
The act covered an array of topics. It contained religious and language rights. It allowed the Métis to have rights to have denominational schools. The act stated that laws had to be written and enforced in both French and English, either English or French can be used in the Legislature of Manitoba and any courts established by either Canada or the Province must use both languages. These have led to political controversy such as the Manitoba Schools Question in the nineteenth century, as denominational school rights were curtailed.

=== Parliament of Canada ===
The act also provided for Manitoba to send four members to the House of Commons of Canada and two members to the Senate of Canada.

== Controversies ==
Since the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; was put into action, it has been adjusted and under review multiple times. Historian D. N. Sprague notes that the land assigned to the Métis in the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; was later revised by government laws, which took land away from the Métis. In order to receive scrip for children living or deceased, proof of birth in Manitoba prior to 1871 was required. Proof could be in the form of a baptismal or death certificate from the church, or a letter from an employer such as the HBC. The legislature also enacted English-only laws, which were later found unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Canada in the case &quot;Reference re Manitoba Language Rights&quot; (1985). The &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, and Section 31 in particular, was also used in the 2013 Supreme Court case &quot;Manitoba Métis Federation v. Canada and Manitoba&quot;.

=== The Manitoba School Crisis ===
Most clauses in the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; were agreed upon apart from one. Topics such as language and religion were safeguarded by the government and recognized by the Canadian court system. The clause on the right to English and French in educational systems was not safeguarded and was instead disputed amongst political figures. Notable people such as Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau and Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie had opposing views on the clause that would affect the right to education in French or English.

=== Section 31 ===
Section 31 required the government to provide a tract of land to each Métis child upon reaching the age of 21 years, from a notional pool of 1.4 million acres of land appropriated for this purpose. Métis families were promised a large amount of land through the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;. The government, however, did not grant the land until the land had been surveyed. The act, therefore, ensured this process. However, the Canadian government later realized that the amount of land that was promised fell short compared to the number of Métis children entitled. This issue is what changed the process of receiving land by lottery draw through the Land Titles Office to money scrips. The government decided to allot money scrips in place of land, which could only be provided for the purchase of lands in government-owned parts of the Northwest Territories. In subsequent legal case regarding Section 31, the Court claimed that &quot;there was no request for, expectation of or consideration by Canada to create a Métis homeland or land base.&quot;

=== Validity of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot; ===
Following the enactment of the &quot;Manitoba Act, 1870&quot;, questions arose whether the federal Parliament had the constitutional authority to create new provinces by ordinary federal statute. To eliminate any uncertainty on this point, the Imperial Parliament enacted the &quot;Constitution Act, 1871&quot;, which confirmed that the federal Parliament had the power to establish new provinces and provide for their constitutions.

<doc id="626724" wikidata="Q6679146" url="?curid=626724" title="Lord Darcy (character)">
<text>Lord Darcy is a detective in a fantasy alternate history, created by Randall Garrett. The first stories were asserted to take place in the same year as they were published, but in a world with an alternate history that is different from the real world and that is governed by the rules of magic rather than the rules of physics. Despite the magical trappings, the Lord Darcy stories play fair as whodunnits; magic is never used to &quot;cheat&quot; a solution, and indeed, the mundane explanation is often obscured by the leap to assume a magical cause.

==Title character==
Lord Darcy is the Chief Forensic Investigator or Chief Criminal Investigator for the Duke of Normandy (Prince Richard, the brother of the king), and sometime Special Investigator for the High Court of Chivalry. An Englishman, he lives in Rouen, but spends very little time there. The audience learns that he speaks Anglo-French with an English accent, and that he speaks several languages and dialects fluently.

His full name is never given; he is always referred to by his title as the Lord of Arcy (i.e., Lord d&#x27;Arcy or Lord Darcy), even by his friends. He dresses in the style of an English aristocrat. He thinks of himself as English and yet Arcy seems to be a French place name. How he comes to be addressed as a &quot;Lord&quot; is never explained, though he seems deferential when dealing with other Peers such as Dukes, Counts, and a Marquis. In &quot;Too Many Magicians&quot; Darcy is said to be a cousin of the Marquis of London.

There are two conflicting reports of Lord Darcy&#x27;s age. In &quot;The Muddle of the Woad&quot; he&#x27;s described as a few years older than the King, who&#x27;s ten years older than the Duke of Normandy, who was 19 years old in &quot;The Eyes Have It&quot;, which is set in 1963. This places Lord Darcy&#x27;s date of birth around 1931. However, he&#x27;s described in &quot;The Spell of War&quot; as an 18-year-old lieutenant in the autumn of the War of &#x27;39, which would make him about ten years older.

His assistant is Master Sean O&#x27;Lochlainn, a sorcerer who undertakes magical forensic work. Master Sean is highly proud of Irish magic and its superiority to those of other countries (especially to Polish magic).

==Works==
&quot;Too Many Magicians&quot; is the only Lord Darcy novel written by Randall Garrett: it first appeared in &quot;Analog&quot; magazine from August to November 1966 and was issued in book form by Doubleday in 1967. This was followed by two short story collections: &quot;Murder and Magic&quot; (1979), and &quot;Lord Darcy Investigates&quot; (1981), containing stories that had appeared in &quot;Analog&quot;, &quot;Fantastic&quot; and other magazines. Garrett&#x27;s extended illness and death prevented him from writing more Lord Darcy tales as he had intended.

Two more Lord Darcy novels, &quot;Ten Little Wizards&quot; (1988), and &quot;A Study in Sorcery&quot; (1989), were written by Garrett&#x27;s friend Michael Kurland after Garrett&#x27;s death. The two titles were manifestly modeled on those of famous detective novels by, respectively, Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle. This is similar to the way that &quot;Too Many Magicians&quot; was modeled on a famous novel by Rex Stout (whose Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin have counterparts in the novel&#x27;s universe in the Marquis de London and his Special Investigator, Lord Bontriomphe). In the eleventh chapter of &quot;Ten Little Wizards&quot;, Kurland sets Lord Darcy&#x27;s rank in the peerage as a Baron.

The Lord Darcy series is described in The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction as Garrett&#x27;s &quot;most impressive solo work&quot;.

==Darcy&#x27;s world==
===Magic===
Magic is a scientific discipline, codified in the fourteenth century by Saint Hilary Robert, much involved with higher mathematics and possessed of theoretical and experimental underpinnings as sophisticated as those of real world physics and chemistry. Licensed Sorcerers, possessed of the Talent and properly trained, achieve a wide range of effects. Healing by the laying on of hands is effective and a commonplace treatment for disease and injury; thanks to the efficacy of the Healers, it is common for people to live to the age of 100 and not rare for people to live to 125.

Black magic is not a categorically different type of magic, but a matter of symbolism and intent, at least in the Anglo-French sphere, as the Kingdom of Italy requests extradition of a woman for black magic when her actual offense was no more than unlicensed magic. However, the effect of symbolism and intent can be substantial; one character, a Witch-Smeller, is capable of detecting its effects on the black magician and his victims.

Although magic is a central part of all the stories, none of the murders Lord Darcy investigates are directly caused by magic. All the homicides are committed by mundane means.

===Social structure===
France and the British Isles are combined into a single state as the Anglo-French Empire, and Russia, Italy, and Germany continue as loose collections of small states. Society is stratified, with the most important government positions held by nobles, who dispense justice and still maintain private soldiers. The Church is powerful and a central component of everyone&#x27;s life (there had never been a Reformation, or it took a very different form, as some of the worst abuses of the late-Medieval/Renaissance Catholic Church seem to have been eliminated or minimized). However, serfdom is as dead as in the real world, and the rights of the common people appear to be somewhat well protected.

Anglo-French regard themselves as fortunate in comparison to the subjects of the Polish King, who are reported to be living under a terrible tyranny. The characters all live in the Anglo-French domain, but include a Polish refugee, who was accused by the Italian government of black magic and is compelled to spy for Poland by a threat to her uncle.

===Education===
Little is mentioned of education, although Oxford continues. Lord Darcy is mentioned as being a graduate of the fictional Magog College (1954). A fictional St. Thomas&#x27; Academy is also mentioned.

===Technology===
Technology and physical sciences have suffered somewhat with the emphasis on magic. Physics has not been codified as a science; the one example of an investigator into the discipline is an eccentric on a par with the members of the real world Flat Earth Society. Most mechanical devices are approximately those of the Victorian era. Characters travel by horse-drawn carriage and steam train and employ revolving pistols and bolt-action rifles; buildings are illuminated with gas lights. An electric torch, with magical parts, is &quot;a fantastic device, a secret of His Majesty&#x27;s Government.&quot; Messages can be sent by an electrical device called the &quot;teleson&quot;, but the principles by which it operates are not well understood, and the technology to lay teleson lines underwater or over water has not yet been developed and so it is impossible to communicate across the Channel.

Food is sometimes preserved in iceboxes; a magical &quot;food preservator&quot; has been invented, but preservators are expensive and rare because the stasis spell used is expensive to maintain, requiring the services of a specialist Journeyman or Master-grade magician. Sorcery is commonly employed in murder investigations, in much the same fashion as forensic science in the real world. Medical technology is not as advanced as in the real world, because Healers are so effective, indeed the use of drugs with a genuine but non-magical benefit (&quot;may cover a wound with moldy bread... or give a patient with heart trouble a tea brewed of foxglove&quot;) is regarded as little more than superstition.

===International situation===

The Anglo-French Empire was established by the Plantagenets, whose dynasty has continued to rule and continues to use the Palace of Westminster as a royal residence, with Parliament far weaker than in the real world timeline. Richard I returned to England after he was wounded at the siege of Chaluz, but he later recovered and ruled well, but John Lackland never held the throne and died in exile. Richard then went on to a decisive victory in the Anglo-French War, which, in real world history, King John lost. Richard dethroned the Capetian Dynasty and made himself and his successors Kings of France as well as of England, both kingdoms being ruled from London, while Paris was left into the 20th century a provincial town that broods over its lost glory.

The Duchy of Normandy remained attached to the English crown and never separated from it. Richard died in 1219 and was succeeded by his nephew Arthur, whose reign was remembered as a Golden Age and sometimes confused in the popular imagination with that of King Arthur. The present king, 750 years later, is &quot;John IV, by the Grace of God, King and Emperor of England, France, Scotland, Ireland [all the Anglo-French Empire], New England [North America], and New France [South America]; Defender of the Faith, et cetera&quot;.

To judge by the Irishman who has a central role in the stories, the Irish in this timeline do not feel particularly oppressed under the Anglo-French throne and have no inclination to become independent. Ireland seems to have been spared traumatic periods of foreign colonisation and dispossession, and since everybody is Catholic, it has no problems of rival religious-ethnic communities. Moreover, the Irish are considered especially skilled in Magic, a source of upwards social mobility and prestige.

The king is also Holy Roman Emperor, exercising loose sovereignty over the many small German and Italian states. However, his actual exercise of sovereignty is limited by the ability of German states to call upon the Poles for help. The chronologically-first but not the first-written Lord Darcy story takes place during a military confrontation between Anglo-French and Polish forces on the soil of Bavaria.

In Italy, the King-Emperor is more of a constitutional monarch, with an Italian Parliament seemingly holding much more power than the one in London (in a story set in Italy, a local policeman emphasizes that his oath of office is to the Parliament, rather than to the King). There is no mention, however, of whether the Parliament is appointed or elected or by whom. Italy being united implies that the Catholic Church was, like in real world history, deprived at some time of its Temporal power over the city of Rome and its environs, but there is no mention of when and how that happened.

Poland is a major power and the chief rival of the Anglo-French, and both exist in a situation of Cold War; some of the stories are spy thrillers in which Lord Darcy is pitted against Polish agents and takes on some of the attributes of James Bond (with some magic ingredients added, such as a spell used to make him fall madly in love with a beautiful female Polish agent).

Hungary is part of the Polish Empire (the University of Buda-Pest is mentioned as one of Poland&#x27;s major institutes of learning), which seems to extend southwards into the Balkans. It is stated that Kiev is part of the Polish Empire, as well as most of the Ukrainian steppe. The Russias are no more than a set of fractious statelets, which might unify in the face of Polish aggression but as yet have failed to do so (it had been close to that situation in some periods of real world history, as during the Polish-Muscovite War (1605–1618)).

The main strategy of the Anglo-French is to bottle up the Poles and deny them access to the world&#x27;s oceans. There is mention of a war in the 1940s (roughly equivalent to World War II but of a much more limited extent) in which the Polish Navy was decisively beaten. Since then, an alliance with the Scandinaviams at the exit from the Baltic and with the Roumelians (Byzantines) at the exit from the Black Sea denies passage to Polish warships, but they try to circumvent this blockade and build an ocean-going navy with the help of some African states.

As noted, the Byzantine Empire continues to exist and is, at least at times, an Anglo-French ally, but it is a minor power corresponding to real world Greece, with its main importance being the control of the strategic Dardanelles. The Osmanlis rule a realm beyond it that has apparently never spread beyond Anatolia. The Kingdoms of Castile and Aragon never united into a single Spanish realm and were never of much account, and Southern Spain is still predominantly Muslim (one story features a suave Muslim from Granada residing in London).

Since the Point of Departure, which set the alternate history off is the survival of Richard the Lion Heart until 1219 and his success in eliminating the Capetians and making himself King of France, the Fourth Crusade of 1204, which fatally crippled the Byzantine Empire in real world history, presumably never took place in this history. Also, with John Lackland never taking the throne, he never had a chance to behave tyrannically as a king and so there was no rebellion culminating in the Magna Carta, which may very partially explain the lack of any democratic institutions in this 20th century. (Garrett may have thus meant to imply that the villains of history sometimes have their uses.)

Mexico (Mechicoe in Anglo-French) is still ruled by Aztecs, who are headed by the Christianised descendants of Montezuma after they have been taken into the empire&#x27;s high nobility and possess considerable autonomy. North America, the whole of which is called &quot;New England&quot;, is in the process of being settled by Europeans, but the process is far less advanced than in real world history, with Native American tribes in the 1960s still able to offer significant resistance to whites encroaching on their land. However, there is also mention of thriving tobacco plantations, which seems to indicate that the equivalent of the American South is more thickly settled than the American North. Mention is made of the first European ships reaching the shores of new England in 1569.

Little is mentioned of &quot;New France&quot; (South America) beyond a single mention of its jungles being a punitive posting to unruly soldiers from which it is clear that Native inhabitants are far from completely subdued there either.

There are only few references to Africa. Lord Darcy&#x27;s father, who was an army &quot;coronel&quot; (colonel), is mentioned as having fought in a war at Sudan, which might be not exactly the same as the real world timeline&#x27;s state of that name. In West Africa, black states are mentioned as maintaining their independence, keeping a balance between the Anglo-French and the Poles and possessing enough technology to equip modern warships. The impression given is that Africa was not as heavily touched by colonialism as in the real world timeline. (Presumably, that is because the Anglo-French have a whole continent at their disposal on the other side of the Atlantic and do their best to bar Polish access.)

<text>Charles Henri Frédéric Dumont de Sainte-Croix (27 April 1758 – 8 January 1830) was a French zoologist.

A lawyer by trade, he was also an enthusiastic amateur ornithologist. Between 1817 and 1818, he described a number of Javanese bird species discovered by Jean Baptiste Leschenault de la Tour; he also contributed articles on ornithology to the &quot;Dictionnaire des sciences naturelles&quot;, edited and published from 1816 to 1830 by F. G. Levrault.

Dumont de Sainte-Croix&#x27;s daughter, Clémence married René-Primevère Lesson, a surgeon and noted French naturalist.

His younger brother, André Dumont was elected to the Convention during the French Revolution.

He was honoured in 1813, in the naming of &quot;Dumontia&quot;, which is a genus of red algae belonging to the family Dumontiaceae.

<text>Braemar Castle is situated near the village of Braemar in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is a possession of the chief of Clan Farquharson and is leased to a local charitable foundation. It is open to the public.

==History==
From the Late Middle Ages, the castle was a stronghold of the Earls of Mar. The present Braemar Castle was constructed in 1628 by John Erskine, Earl of Mar, as a hunting lodge and to counter the rising power of the Farquharsons, replacing an older building, which was the successor of nearby Kindrochit Castle, which dates from the 11th century AD. The siting of Kindrochit Castle was based upon the strategic location of this site relative to historic crossings of the Grampian Mounth.

An important garrison after the 1745 Jacobite rising, Braemar Castle had been attacked and burned by John Farquharson, the &quot;Black Colonel&quot; of Inverey during the Jacobite rising of 1689, to prevent it being used as a garrison by Government troops. In 1716 the castle was forfeited to the Crown following the Earl of Mar&#x27;s leadership of the 1715 Jacobite rising. The castle and lands were purchased by John Farquharson, 9th Laird of Invercauld but the building was left in ruins until 1748 when it was leased to the government at a fee of £14 per year, now to serve as a garrison for Hanoverian troops. From 1760 to 1806 the estate was used largely for commercial woodland, but on a massive scale, with James Farquharson of Invercauld planting 16 million fir trees and 2 million larch during this period. 

Rebuilding started under the command of John Adam, Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance.

In 1831 the military garrison was withdrawn and the castle returned to the Farquharson clan. Restoration to provide a family home began under the 12th Laird of Invercauld who entertained Queen Victoria there when she attended the Braemar Gatherings in the grounds of the castle. In 1800 Braemar Castle was documented to have its moat intact.

It has also featured in the video to Andy Stewart&#x27;s &quot;A Scottish Soldier&quot;.

Since 2006 the castle has been leased to the local community. It is run on behalf of the community by local charity, Braemar Community Ltd and staffed by local volunteers, and an ambitious restoration programme has been started. It reopened to the public in 2008.

==Structure==
The building is a five-storey L-plan castle with a star-shaped curtain wall of six sharp-angled salients, and with three storey angle turrets. The central tower enfolds a round stair tower and is built of granite covered with harl. The main entrance retains an original iron yett, and many of the windows are protected by heavy iron grilles.

On the ground floor are stone-vaulted rooms which contained the guardroom, ammunition store and original kitchen. These are built out into the salients of the outer wall, and in Victorian times a second kitchen was added adjoining the staff rooms. In the floor of a passage, an iron grill provided access to the &quot;Laird&#x27;s Pit&quot;, a dark hole used as a dungeon.

On each of the upper floors a large room and a small room occupied the two arms of the tower. On the first floor are the &quot;Dining Room&quot; and &quot;Morning Room&quot;, whilst on the floor above is the &quot;Laird&#x27;s Day Room&quot;, entered by a curved door. Opposite is the &quot;Rose Room&quot;, and between the two is a small bathroom installed in 1901. In the main wing at this level is the &quot;Drawing Room&quot;, containing graffiti incised on the window shutters by government troops. The words &quot;John Chestnut, Sergeant, 1797&quot; can be clearly seen. On the third floor is the &quot;Four Poster Bedroom&quot;, whilst on the fourth floor lie the &quot;Ladies Guest Bedroom&quot;, &quot;Gentlemans Guest Bedroom&quot; and the &quot;Principal Bedroom&quot;. These upper floors were used by the Farquharson family in the latter years of their visits.

<text>Minsden Chapel is an isolated ruined chapel in the fields above the hamlet of Chapelfoot, near Preston, Hertfordshire. Today it is a roofless shell, partly surrounded by a small wood, and accessible only by footpath. It is a Scheduled Monument and is Grade II Listed.

==History==

The chapel was built in the 14th century, and by the 17th century had
fallen into disrepair. Marriages continued here into the 18th century, until the crumbling masonry became too dangerous. One story says that a piece of falling stonework knocked the prayer-book out of a curate&#x27;s hand during the marriage ceremony of Enoch West and Mary Horn on the 11th of July 1738.

In the 20th century the chapel was closely associated with the historian Reginald Hine from nearby Baldock. He frequently visited here, and eventually obtained a lifetime lease of the building from the vicars of Hitchin. So fond of the chapel was he, that he even bade &quot;trespassers and sacrilegious persons take warning, for I will proceed against them with the utmost rigour of the law, and, after my death and burial, I will endeavour, in all ghostly ways, to protect and haunt its hallowed walls&quot;. Contrary to popular belief Hine is not buried at Minsden. His body was cremated at Golders Green (London) and his ashes were subsequently scattered at the chapel. His family erected a memorial stone at the site, which was subsequently re-laid in its current grave-like horizontal position by them after it was damaged by vandals in the early 1980s.

In 1907, Thomas William Latchmore, a local professional photographer and friend of Hine, took a photograph that supposedly showed a ghostly monk at the Chapel. Rumours of paranormal activity first appeared around this time. The haunting most frequently reported is that of a single monk climbing stairs (which no longer exist) to the north-east area of the chapel; this is said to occur at midnight on Halloween.
Other reported experiences include the sighting of a glowing cross on the wall, and the hearing of distant music or the ringing of the stolen bells. Legends also exist of a lost tunnel built during the time of the Crusades that extended to nearby Temple Dinsley, and another of a murdered nun.

In an interview given in 1930 to Elliott O&#x27;Donnell, a well-known contemporary writer on occult matters, Latchmore finally admitted that his &#x27;Minsden Ghost&#x27; photograph was a hoax. He explained that the picture was the deliberate result of an experiment in the techniques of double exposures, a subject that interested him greatly at the time. Although Latchmore refused to disclose the identity of the individual who had posed as the ghostly figure, it seems likely that it was a young man well known for practical jokes, Latchmore&#x27;s good friend Reginald Hine. Hine re-published the photograph in 1929 in his &quot;History of Hitchin&quot; but never admitted it was a fake nor his own part in it.

Paranormal investigator Peter Underwood once spent a night there in the late 1940s, during which he claimed to have heard the sound of distant music and to have seen a white glowing cross on one of the walls, which disappeared and then reappeared, although he suggested &quot;it could possibly have been a trick of the moonlight, as a full moon was shining down through the trees at the time&quot;.

The iconic arch of Minsden Chapel finally fell in 2008 due to time and erosion from the elements and by 2012 most of the north facing wall had also disappeared. In 2017, it was reported that the Church Commissioners for England, who own the site, were intending to sell it to a &quot;surrounding landowner&quot;, sparking fears that the public could lose access to the site.

Work to repair Minsden Chapel by Natural England in partnership with Historic England started in March 2022 with the intention of stabilising the arch openings of the south wall, to conserve the overall structure and to install hard-capping over the wall head.

<text>Castle Fraser is the most elaborate Z-plan castle in Scotland and one of the grandest &#x27;Castles of Mar&#x27;. It is located near Kemnay in the Aberdeenshire region of Scotland. The castle stands in over of landscaped grounds, woodland and farmland which includes a walled kitchen garden of the 19th century. There is archaeological evidence of an older square tower dating from around 1400 or 1500 within the current construction. The castle is a Category A listed building and the grounds are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==Construction==
Originally known as &quot;Muchall-in-Mar&quot;, construction of the elaborate, five-storey Z-plan castle was begun in 1575 by the 6th Laird of Fraser, Michael Fraser, on the basis of an earlier tower, and was completed in 1636. A panel on the northern side of the castle is signed &quot;I Bel&quot;, believed to be the mark of the master mason John Bell of Midmar, the castle is a joint creation over several decades with another master mason of this period, Thomas Leiper.

Castle Fraser is contemporary with other nearby castles: Craigievar Castle, Crathes Castle and Midmar Castle which are also believed to have been designed by the Bell family of master masons.

The castle was modernised in a classical style in the late 18th century, with a new entrance inserted in the south side and sash windows throughout. This work was supervised by Elyza Fraser, the lady laird, assisted by Mary Bristow. Elyza was also responsible for the landscaping of the grounds, sweeping away the remains of the original formal gardens and orchards, and for the construction of the impressive octagonal stable block.

The interiors of the building were entirely reconstructed again between 1820 and 1850, by Charles Fraser, using the architects John Smith and William Burn. The Library is a fine example of John Smith&#x27;s regency style with Tudor detailing. Many of William Burn&#x27;s more extravagant Gothic designs for the most important rooms were not carried out, although a Gothic-style pipe organ was installed (now removed to Kemnay Church).

External works during this period included the construction of the twin gatehouses (still extant), and a grand domed stair and access corridors with loggias in the courtyard (removed).
The castle was partially restored by the new owners around 1950. The architect and antiquary Dr William Kelly supervised the removal of much 19th-century work to reveal the earlier fabric.

Castle Fraser retains the atmosphere of a family home and still contains the original contents, including Fraser family portraits, furniture and collections. The evocative interiors represent all periods of the castle&#x27;s history, from the Medieval stone vaulted Great Hall to the Regency Dining Room.

==Ownership==

Castle Fraser was built as the home of the Frasers of Muchalls, later Frasers of Castle Fraser. The castle was passed down through the Lords Fraser, the Frasers of Inverallochy and then the Mackenzie family who took the name Mackenzie Fraser. In 1897 the last male Fraser of the direct line, Frederick Mackenzie Fraser, died childless. In 1921 his widow, Theodora, sold the castle due to the lack of a suitable heir and mounting financial difficulties. The buyer was Weetman Pearson, 1st Viscount Cowdray. The Pearson family restored the castle as a shooting lodge and gave it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1976. The Trust now opens the castle to visitors all year round along with the grounds and walled garden. During 2019, the site received 56,822 visitors.

==In film==
Some scenes in the 2006 film &quot;The Queen&quot;, starring Dame Helen Mirren, featured Castle Fraser as a backdrop.

<doc id="626746" wikidata="Q1923521" url="?curid=626746" title="Drum Castle">
<text>Drum Castle is a castle near Drumoak in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. For centuries it was the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine. The place-name Drum is derived from Gaelic &quot;druim&quot;, &#x27;ridge&#x27;. The site is located approximately northeast of Banchory and west of Peterculter. The property is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland and is open to the public.

==History==

The original 13th-century tower of Drum Castle has been suggested as the work of medieval architect Richard Cementarius, who built the Brig o&#x27; Balgownie, the first Bridge of Don, in Old Aberdeen. It is believed to be one of the three oldest tower houses in Scotland (and notably unaltered). A large wing was added in 1619 by the 9th laird, and further alterations were made during the Victorian era.

The castle and its grounds were granted to William de Irwyn in 1323 by Robert the Bruce, and remained in the possession of Clan Irvine until 1975. William de Irwyn (of the Irvings of Bonshaw clan) was armour bearer/secretary (and neighbour) to King Robert the Bruce. In June 1636 Sir Alexander Irvine of Drum and his wife Magdalene Scrimgeour were censured for harbouring the outlaw Gilderoy. Drum played a role in the Covenanting Rebellion (as did nearby Muchalls Castle) leading to its being attacked and sacked three times.

In the 19th century, it was the home of Alexander Forbes Irvine of Drum FRSE (1818–1892). He had inherited the estate in 1861, on the death of his father. In 1875/1876, he arranged for a restoration of the courtyard, and the addition of an arched entrance and angle tower. He was also partly responsible for a restoration of the chapel.

There was an older church located here; it was modified to create the chapel in the 1500s and 1600s. In 1857, the west window was enlarged and the cross was added; a new roof was also installed and some restoration of the interior was completed.

The site was once served by Drum railway station on the Deeside Railway. Service was discontinued in 1951.

==Recent status==
The castle has been a Category-A Listed property since 1987. The report states that the agreement with the National Trust was made in 1964 by Mr H.Q. Forbes Irvine, the 24th Laird, and that the agreement came into force in 1976, after 650 years of ownership by the Irvine Lairds. The summary states that the tower was built in 1280–1300, that the Jacobean Wing was added in 1619 and that modifications were made ca. 1800, 1840 and 1875. The Chapel is Category-B Listed as are the Walled Garden and East Lodge; in 1987, the garden was &quot;derelict&quot;.

The chapel, dining hall and estate may be hired for weddings and corporate functions. The current (early 2020) NTS website, however, discusses its Garden of Historic Roses, spread out over four distinct areas. The grand Victorian library with over 4,000 books was one of the attractions; the castle was also offering a &quot;programme of temporary exhibitions throughout the year&quot;. A tourism website added that the castle &quot;contains superb furniture and paintings. In the 16th-century chapel are a beautiful stained glass window and the Augsburg silver Madonna&quot;. The site has a playground, a small shop and a tearoom.

The castle, gardens and estate are open to visitors throughout the year. During 2019, 47,446 people visited the castle.

==Area&#x27;s ancient history==
Prehistoric habitation of the local area is known through archaeological sites such as Balbridie. Roman legions marched from Raedykes to nearby Normandykes as they sought higher ground evading the bogs of Red Moss and other low-lying mosses associated with the Burn of Muchalls. That march used the Elsick Mounth, one of the ancient trackways crossing the Grampian Mountains; the situation of the Elsick Mounth terminating at a ford to the River Dee is thought to have been instrumental in the strategic siting of Drum Castle as a point to monitor traffic on the Elsick Mounth lying west of Netherley.

<doc id="626754" wikidata="Q2748806" url="?curid=626754" title="Crathes Castle">
<text>Crathes Castle (pronounced ) is a castle, built in the 16th century, near Banchory in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It is in the historic county of Kincardineshire. This harled castle was built by the Burnetts of Leys and was owned by the family for almost 400 years. The castle and its grounds are currently owned and managed by the National Trust for Scotland and are open to the public.

==History==
Crathes sits on land given as a gift to the Burnetts of Ley family by King Robert the Bruce in 1323.

In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Burnett of Leys built a fortress of timbers on an island they made in the middle of a nearby bog. This method of fortification, known as a crannog, was common in the Late Middle Ages. Construction of the current tower house of Crathes Castle was begun in 1553 but delayed several times during its construction due to political problems during the reign of Mary, Queen of Scots.

It was completed in 1596 by Alexander Burnett of Leys, and an additional wing added in the 18th century. Alexander Burnett, who completed the construction of Crathes, began a new project, the early 17th-century reconstruction of nearby Muchalls Castle. That endeavour was completed by his son, Sir Thomas Burnett.

In 1877, Sir Robert Burnett transformed the Great Hall by adding oak panelling and gilded leather in a faux-medieval style, to satisfy his New York wife Matilda and her guests that they were living in a truly old structure. Robert also purchased a whole new suite of furnishings for the entire structure of both antique and faux antique style as he thought befitted the house. Several painted beam ceilings, long covered by Georgian plasterwork, were re-exposed in 1913 during construction works (they had been spotted during the 1877 works and recovered).

Crathes Castle served as the ancestral seat of the Burnetts of Leys until Sir James Burnett, 13th Baronet gave it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1951. The family continued to live in the house.

The Great Hall was stripped back to its bare stone walls in 1953.

Another historically important structure in this region linked to the Burnett of Leys family is Monboddo House.

==Fire==

A fire damaged portions of the castle (in particular the &quot;Queen Anne&quot; wing) on 6 January 1966.

After the fire the laird, James Cecil Burnett was limited to the use of &quot;a stump of the service wing&quot; as his actual residence. The quarters and possessions of the on-site National Trust representative, Miss Jean Dodds, were wholly destroyed. It was decided by the National Trust&#x27;s resident architect Schomberg Scott that the Queen Anne wing should be rebuilt to its original height of two storeys and that the Victorian wing should be wholly demolished.

The insurance company paid £65,000; half of which was used to build the Burnetts a new house detached from the castle.

==Interior==

The castle contains a significant collection of portraits, and intriguing original Scottish renaissance painted ceilings survive in several Jacobean rooms: the &quot;Chamber of the Muses&quot;, the &quot;Chamber of Nine Worthies&quot; and the &quot;Green Lady&#x27;s Room&quot;.

Original furniture still in the house and on display includes a carved bed and two caquetoire chairs dating from 1597 and bearing the owners&#x27; initials and heraldry.

==Garden and grounds==
The castle estate is and contains of woodlands and fields, including nearly of walled garden. Within the walled garden are gravel paths with surrounding specimen plants, mostly in herbaceous borders. Many of the plants are labelled with taxonomic descriptions. There is also a grass croquet court at a higher terraced level within the walled garden. Ancient topiary hedges of Irish yew dating from 1702 separate the gardens into eight themed areas. Crathes and its grounds are open to tourists throughout the year. A visitor centre provides information about the castle and its surroundings. There is a tea shop on site and a car park for any size of car.

==Mesolithic calendar==
In 2004 excavations at the castle uncovered a series of pits believed to date from about 10,000 years ago. The find was analysed in 2013 and is considered to be the world&#x27;s oldest known lunar calendar dating from 8000 BC to about 4000 BC. This dating would make the structure up to five thousand years older than previously recorded time-measuring monuments in Mesopotamia.

The site of Warren Field was identified from aerial photography when unusual crop marks were seen by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.

<doc id="626771" wikidata="Q7922834" url="?curid=626771" title="Vertical flute">
<text>The vertical flute is either (1) a rim-blown (notched or unnotched) flute, (2) a tubular duct flute, with tapered bore or (3) a transversely blown flute, Giorgi flute, designed to be played in an upright position. The vertical flute is contrasted with the &quot;cross flute&quot; (or &quot;transverse flute&quot;) and &quot;globular flute&quot;, and in stricter usage may refer only to the first category above (Marcuse 1975, 187).
The most familiar ducted vertical flutes are the recorder, tin whistle, and tabor pipe. One historical variety has a slightly tapered (decreasing diameter) bore with 6 tone holes on the top side. A dorsal thumb hole is absent. It sometimes has a small foot section with a single key. The range is a little more than two octaves and the common keynote is &quot;D&quot; major. The instrument is often mistaken for a recorder with keynote C, but. like the tin whistle and tabor pipe, relies on overblowing to change registers instead of pinching open a thumbhole, recorder style, to &quot;cancel&quot; the fundamental harmonic (Bessarabov 1941, p62 – p63). 

An unusual case of a transversely blown but vertically held flute is a special variation of the standard flute, or, more specifically, the Western concert flute, designed to be played in an upright position. This version uses a standard cross-blown flute head joint bent in a &quot;?&quot; question mark shape.

<text>Craigievar Castle is a harled castle or fortified country house south of Alford, Aberdeenshire, Scotland. It was the seat of Clan Sempill, and the Forbes family resided here for 350 years until 1963, when the property was sold to the National Trust for Scotland by the 19th Lord Sempill.

==History==
An example of the original Scottish Baronial architecture, the seven-storey castle was completed in 1626 by the Aberdonian merchant William Forbes, ancestor of the Forbes baronets of Craigievar and brother of the Bishop of Aberdeen, Patrick Forbes of Corse Castle. Forbes purchased the partially completed structure from the impoverished Mortimer family in the year 1610. He arranged for the continued construction, completing it in 1625 or 1626.

Forbes was nicknamed &quot;Danzig Willy&quot;, a reference to his shrewd international trading success with the Baltic states. Some used the nickname &quot;Willy the Merchant&quot;, also based on the substantial profits he made while &quot;merchandising at Dantzick&quot;, according to one source. 
William&#x27;s son became a baronet of Nova Scotia by Charles I; this title is now extant. The Forbes Baronetcy, of Craigievar in the County of Aberdeen, was created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 20 April 1630 for William Forbes. He was also a descendant of Hon. Patrick Forbes, third son of the second Lord Forbes, and the nephew of the first baronet of the 1628 creation. The fourth baronet represented Aberdeenshire in the House of Commons. The 5th Baronet married the Hon. Sarah Sempill, eldest daughter of Hugh Sempill, 12th Lord Sempill. Their grandson, the eighth Baronet, succeeded as seventeenth Lord Sempill in 1884 (see the Lord Sempill for earlier history of this title). The titles remained united until the death of his grandson, the 19th Lord and tenth Baronet, in 1965.

Designed in the L-plan, as was Muchalls Castle, which is located in the same region, Craigievar is noted for its crafted plasterwork ceilings. Craigevar, Muchalls Castle and Glamis Castle are generally considered to have the three finest ceilings in Scotland. The Clan Forbes family was close friends of the Clan Burnett of Leys, who built both Crathes Castle and Muchalls Castle. The ceilings feature plaster figures of the Nine Worthies and other family emblems.

===19th century===

By the early 1800s, the tower had fallen into decay. Sir John Forbes had considered demolishing the tower and consulted the Aberdeen city architect John Smith, who advised against that course of action, stating the tower was: &quot;one of the finest specimens in the Country of the age and style in which it was built.&quot; He decided to restore the building. Roof repairs were undertaken circa 1826; a timber base covered with slates was used. At about the same time, &quot;the towers were altered and raised and a new entrance door was put in, which was subsequently restored to the original entrance&quot; according to the records of the Aberdeenshire Council.

Reconstruction of almost the entire top floor was also completed. The windows, external harling and pointing were replaced, and it is likely Smith also designed the gardener&#x27;s cottage.

The castle originally had more defensive elements including a walled courtyard with four round towers; only one of the round towers remains today. In the arched door to that round tower are preserved the carved initials of Sir Thomas Forbes, William Forbes&#x27; son. There is also a massive iron portcullis or gate covering the entrance door which is named a yett.

According to the folklore of the area, the castle is haunted by one or more ghosts.

===20th century===
The Forbes family also owned a large granite house at Fintray near Inverurie, Aberdeenshire. This became the family&#x27;s main residence for a number of years until the Second World War. During the war, Fintray House was used as a hospital for wounded Belgian soldiers.

In 1963, the family sold Craigievar estate to the National Trust for Scotland, which took over operation. Since 1990, the estate has been a listed building of the Aberdeenshire Council.

By the late 1970s, the castle interior boasted a Great Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians&#x27; gallery; secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen&#x27;s Bedroom; servants&#x27; quarters and several plasterwork ceilings. There was a collection of Forbes family portraits inside as well as a considerable quantity of Forbes furnishings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. The castle also housed two original Henry Raeburn portraits complete with original receipts.

==21st century==

Between November 2007 and 2009, the castle was closed for its exterior to be given a new harl, returning it to what is believed to be a close equivalent of the harling put in place during the refurbishment of 1820. It was reopened to the public in April 2010. One report provided these specifics about the work and the state of the castle as of 2010:The tower was renovated and rehabbed ... featuring a traditional lime-based alternative to concrete-based harling and returning the castle to what would have been its original shade of pink. The castle interior boasts a Great Hall that has the Stuart Arms over the fireplace; a musicians&#x27; gallery; a secret staircase connecting the high tower to the Great Hall; Queen&#x27;s Bedroom; servants&#x27; quarters and several splendid plasterwork ceilings. The castle contains a collection of Forbes family portraits and furnishings dating to the 17th and 18th centuries.

No artificial lighting was ever added to the upper floors of the castle, so the artefacts would be viewed in the same natural light as they were during the previous centuries.

In 2019, a report provided this summary of the castle grounds:

Little remains of the 17th-century-designed landscape and the grounds around the Castle date from the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Further planting, particularly of ornamental conifers, was added at the end of the 19th century. In the 1930s a rock garden was created behind the coach house and, more recently, flower borders were added around the Castle and in the kitchen garden.

In early 2019, a volunteer discovered what is apparently the original door of the property, made of oak; it was replaced in 1825 and was considered to be missing until 2019. The door was subsequently restored and put on display. 

By 2013, the castle, its grounds and an estate of over of adjoining farmland and woodland were in their 50th year as a property of the National Trust for Scotland. Visits to the castle were allowed from Easter, or from the first of April (whichever is the earlier) until the end of September. In 2018, the castle was open between April and June, on Fridays to Tuesdays for guided tours; the grounds were open throughout the year. The site received 24,072 visitors in 2019. The National Trust continued to operate tours of the castle in 2019, but during 2020, the estate was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK; upon reopening in July, visits were allowed only on the grounds for the rest of the season.

A September 2020 report states that the castle &quot;holds a foremost place among the examples of what is known as the fourth or L period, from the form of ground plan upon which nearly all the Scottish castles of that date&quot;.

The castle was closed to visitors for about two years while the exterior was properly restored by National Trust for Scotland. The exterior was coated in limewash, the most effective coating over stone walls in the local climate. It reopened at the end of May 2024.

The castle relies on its windows for light, as there is no electricity in the rooms. The family had insisted in 1963 that the interiors not be changed, including artworks, decorative plaster work, panelling, and the lack of electricity for room lighting. The gift shop has a bit of electric lighting. Some members of the Forbes family, raised in the castle before the 1963 donation to Scotland, visit the castle in this decade of the 2020s. The exterior pink color was part of Aberdeen architect John Smith&#x27;s 1826 makeover to &quot;match the colour of the granite mouldings&quot;.

==In popular culture==
The castle is reputed to have been the inspiration for Walt Disney&#x27;s castle motif. This influence on Walt Disney for his pink Cinderella castle was confirmed by James Henderson of the National Trust for Scotland.

<text>Isola del Giglio (; ), or Giglio Island in English, is an Italian island and (municipality) in the Tyrrhenian Sea, off the coast of Tuscany, and is part of the Province of Grosseto. The island is one of seven that form the Tuscan Archipelago, lying within the Arcipelago Toscano National Park. means &quot;lily&quot; in Italian, and though the name would appear consistent with the insignia of Medici Florence, it originally derives from the Latin name of the island, , which in turn could be related to the Ancient Greek name of the neighbouring Capraia, (, Latinized as ), from &quot;goat&quot;.

==Geography==
The island is separated by a stretch of sea from the nearest point of the mainland, the promontory of Monte Argentario. Mainly mountainous, it consists almost entirely of granite, culminating in the Poggio della Pagana, which rises to . Ninety percent of its surface is covered by Mediterranean vegetation, alternating with large pine forests and numerous vineyards which allow the production of the local &quot;Ansonaco&quot; wine. The coast is long, made up of rocks, smooth cliffs and several bays: Arenella, Cannelle, Caldane and Campese, the biggest one with its small village of the same name.

The municipality is composed of the islands of Giglio and Giannutri. Three principal settlements are located on the main island: 
* Giglio Porto (G. Harbour), located on the eastern coastal side and hosts the port. It is divided into the quarters of Chiesa, Moletto and Saraceno.
* Giglio Castello (G. Castle), located upon a hill between the two other localities and characterized by the majestic walls of a fortress. It is divided into the quarters of Casamatta, Centro, Cisterna and Rocca.
* Giglio Campese, it is located on the north-western coastal side and is a modern sea resort.

==History==
The modern island was formed probably 4.5 to 5 million years ago, and has been inhabited since the Stone Age. Later, it was probably an Etruscan military stronghold. Under the Romans it was known as &quot;Aegilium Insula&quot; or &quot;Igillia Insula&quot;. It was an important base in the Tyrrhenian Sea, and was cited briefly by Julius Caesar in his &quot;De Bello Civili&quot;, by Pliny, by Pomponius Mela, and by the fifth-century AD poet Rutilius Claudius Namatianus, who celebrated Igilium&#x27;s successful repulse of the Getae and safe harbor for Romans, in a time when Igilium&#x27;s slopes were still wooded.

In 805, the island was donated by Charlemagne to the abbey of the Tre Fontane in Rome, and was later successively a possession of the Aldobrandeschi, Pannocchieschi, Caetani, and Orsini families, and of the municipality of Perugia. In 1241, the Sicilian and Pisan fleet of Emperor Frederick II destroyed a Genoese fleet in the Battle of Giglio. From 1264, Isola del Giglio was a Pisan dominion, then, after being seized by the Spanish fleet, it was ceded to Antonio Piccolomini, nephew of Pius II from whom it passed to the Medici family in 1558. It suffered several Saracen attacks, which ended only in 1799.

Throughout its history, the island was renowned for its mineral ore: many columns and buildings in Rome were built with the Gigliese granite.

On 14 June 1646, Grand Admiral Jean Armand de Maillé-Brézé was killed at the Battle of Orbetello near the island, at sunset on his flagship the &quot;Grand Saint Louis&quot;.

In 2012, the cruise ship &quot;Costa Concordia&quot; foundered off the coast of the island.

In July 2020, the island attracted global attention because it had not yet experienced any known cases of COVID-19 in the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Main sights ==
The island houses the remains of a Roman villa of Domitius Ahenobarbus (1st-2nd century AD), in the area of Giglio Porto (Giglio port). No traces of the once existing Temple of Diana can be seen now. The church of San Pietro Apostolo in Giglio Castello (Giglio castle) has an ivory crucifix attributed to the sculptor Giambologna.

The island is also the site of an Etruscan shipwreck dating back to the early Iron Age, &quot;c.&quot; 600 BC. The cargo of the ship included copper and lead ingots, iron spits, amphorae and a Corinthian helmet. Even a wooden writing tablet with stylus was preserved. The finds are almost completely lost now.

==Transportation==
Isola del Giglio is connected to Tuscany by ferries run by the shipping companies &quot;Toremar&quot; and &quot;Maregiglio&quot;, departing daily from Porto Santo Stefano.

===&quot;Costa Concordia&quot; grounding incident===
In 2012, the island received prolonged international media attention, following the 13 January 2012 running aground of the cruise liner &quot;Costa Concordia&quot;, just off the island&#x27;s shore. Most of the more than 4,200 passengers and crew were rescued and taken to the island, as well as to the mainland. 32 people died and 64 were injured. The people of the island rushed to help, providing hot drinks and blankets, and many opened their homes to the victims. The arrival of 2,000 salvage workers invigorated life on the island, and many of the workers fraternised with the islanders. Some local women left the island with their new partners.

The ship removal work was started in 2013 and was completed towards the end of July 2014. Flotation devices were attached to right the ship and then raised it. It was subsequently towed to its final destination port of Genoa to be scrapped.

==In popular fiction==
In the 2007 romantic bestselling Italian novel &quot;Scusa ma ti chiamo amore&quot; by Federico Moccia, the couple end up living in a lighthouse on this island.

It is also the site of the sea burial of the captain of The Pharaon in The Count of Monte Cristo.

<text>Fyvie Castle is a castle in the village of Fyvie, near Turriff in Aberdeenshire, Scotland.

==History==
The earliest parts of Fyvie Castle date from the 13th century – some sources claim it was built in 1211 by William the Lion. Fyvie was the site of an open-air court held by Robert the Bruce, and Charles I lived there as a child for 4 years. Following the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, it ceased to be a royal stronghold as it was passed to Henry Preston as a reward from Robert iii.. Instead, it fell into the possession of five successive families – &quot;Preston&quot;, &quot;Meldrum&quot;, &quot;Seton&quot;, &quot;Gordon&quot; and &quot;Forbes-Leith&quot; – each of whom added a new tower to the castle. The oldest of these, the Preston Tower (located on the far right as one faces the main facade of Fyvie), dates to between 1390 and 1433. The impressive Seton tower forms the entrance, and was erected in 1599 by Alexander Seton. He commissioned the great wheel staircase several years later. The Gordon Tower followed in 1777, and the Leith in 1890.

Inside, the castle stronghold features a great wheel stair, a display of original arms and armour, and a collection of portraits, from artists such as Henry Raeburn, Pompeo Batoni and Thomas Gainsborough.

Manus O&#x27;Cahan and Montrose fought a successful minor battle against the Covenant Army at Fyvie Castle on 28 October 1644. The battlefield was added to the Inventory of Historic Battlefields in Scotland in 2011. Anne Halkett stayed at the castle from 1650 to 1652 with the Countess of Dunfermline, she treated wounded soldiers and the illnesses of local people, and negotiated with the English major of a company of Commonwealth soldiers, and with three Colonels, Lilburne, Fitts, and Overton.

The grounds and adjoining Fyvie Lake were landscaped in the 18th century by Col. William Gordon. 

The Scottish industrialist Alexander Leith (later Baron Leith of Fyvie) bought the castle in 1885. His descendants sold it to the National Trust for Scotland in 1984.

To the east there is a walled garden where Scottish fruits are currently cultivated. There is evidence for two other walled gardens closer to the castle itself to its west and south. The one to the west appears on an estate plan of 1768.

==Ghostlore==
The castle (like many places in Scotland) has ghostlore associated with it. A story is told that in 1920 during renovation work the skeleton of a woman was discovered behind a bedroom wall. On the day the remains were laid to rest in Fyvie cemetery, the castle residents started to be plagued by strange noises and unexplained happenings. Fearing he had offended the dead woman, the Laird of the castle had the skeleton exhumed and replaced behind the bedroom wall, at which point the haunting ceased. It is said that there is a secret room in the south-west corner of the castle that must remain sealed lest anyone entering meet with disaster. It is unclear if this is the same room in which the skeleton was found. There is also an indelible blood stain, two ghosts and two curses associated with this place.

One of the curses has been attributed to the prophetic laird, Thomas the Rhymer. The curse is said to have been part of the mysterious three weeping stones. The curse decrees that until all three stones taken from the castle&#x27;s boundary marks are brought together, the firstborn sons of the families who live at Fyvie will never inherit the castle. Only one weeping stone is known to exist and is kept at the castle. The other two have never been found, with one built into the castle walls and the other in the depths of the river Ythan. 

The second curse involves a hidden room in the charter room. The curse is very specific: death to the lord of the castle and blindness to his wife if anyone disturbs it.

==In the media==
Fyvie Castle has featured in a number of British television programmes, such as Living TV&#x27;s &quot;Most Haunted&quot; series 6 and STV&#x27;s Castles of Scotland.
The castle also played host of the setting of a children&#x27;s gameshow on CBBC called &quot;Spook Squad&quot; in 2004.
2009 saw the publication of the children&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;The Time-Tailor and the Fyvie Castle Witch Trials&quot;, written by Deborah Leslie. The castle was also featured in the BBC documentary &quot;Castle Ghosts of Scotland&quot;, narrated by Robert Hardy. 

In recent years, the castle grounds have hosted a &quot;Fyvie Live&quot; music festival in the summer, which was headlined in 2011 by Beverley Knight and in 2012 by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, then following a gap of several years, by The Shires in 2017. Following the revival, it was announced that the event would take place again in 2018, with Ward Thomas as the headline act. in August 2024 it also hosted re-enactors from all over the country to bring a re-enactment of the battle of Fyvie 1644.

Today, the castle is open to tourists between April and October. It is also a wedding venue.

<text>John Macon Thome (August 22, 1843 – September 27, 1908) was an American-Argentine astronomer. Some sources say John Macom Thome. He is sometimes known as &quot;Juan M. Thome&quot;.

He was born in Palmyra, Pennsylvania, and attended Lehigh University.

He came to the Argentine National Observatory (today Observatorio Astronómico de Córdoba) in 1870, working as the senior assistant of the director Benjamin A. Gould. He succeeded Gould as director in 1885.

Under his initiative, the &quot;Cordoba Durchmusterung&quot; star catalogue began to be compiled in 1892, although he did not live to see its completion.

He won the Lalande Prize for astronomy from the French Academy of Sciences in 1901. Thome died in Córdoba and was succeeded as director of the observatory by Charles Dillon Perrine.

<text>The Martin B-57 Canberra is an American-built, twin-engined tactical bomber and reconnaissance aircraft that entered service with the United States Air Force (USAF) in 1953. The B-57 is a license-built version of the British English Electric Canberra, manufactured by the Glenn L. Martin Company. Initial Martin-built models were virtually identical to their British-built twinjet counterparts; Martin later modified the design to incorporate larger quantities of US-sourced components and produced the aircraft in several variants.

The B-57 Canberra holds the distinction of being the first jet bomber in U.S. service to drop bombs during combat. The Canberra was used extensively during the Vietnam War in a bombing capacity; specialized versions of the type were also produced and served as high-altitude aerial reconnaissance platforms (the Martin RB-57D Canberra), and as electronic warfare aircraft. The B-57 Canberra was also sold to export customers abroad; further combat use was seen by the Pakistani Air Force during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 and the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.

In 1983, the USAF opted to retire the type; the B-57 Canberra&#x27;s retirement marked the ending of the era of the tactical bomber. The three remaining flightworthy WB-57Fs are technically assigned to the NASA Johnson Space Center, next to Ellington Field in Houston, as high-altitude scientific research aircraft but have also been used for testing and electronic communications in the U.S. and Afghanistan.

==Development==
===Origins===
At the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, the USAF found itself in dire need of an all-weather interdiction aircraft. The existing inventory of piston-engined Douglas B-26 Invaders had been dispatched in this capacity at the very start of the conflict; within a few months in the theatre, the B-26 had suffered a very high rate of attrition and successes with the type were typically limited. The USAF requested that the British government provide a private demonstration of the English Electric Canberra, a newly developed jet-powered bomber. On 17 August 1950, the Canberra demonstration was performed at RAF Burtonwood in Warrington, Cheshire, England; during the following month, a team of US test pilots and engineers visited English Electric&#x27;s Warton factory to perform a series of flight tests and a detailed technical assessment of the aircraft.

On 16 September 1950, the USAF formally issued a request for a jet-powered bomber; the sought aircraft had to possess a top speed of , ceiling of , and range of . Full all-weather capability and a secondary reconnaissance role also had to be included in the design. The American contenders included the Martin XB-51, the North American B-45 Tornado and AJ Savage. To expedite the process, only projects based on existing aircraft were considered and unusually, the service considered foreign aircraft. These included the Canadian Avro Canada CF-100 and the Canberra, which had not yet officially entered service with the Royal Air Force (RAF). Aviation authors Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist commented that &quot;It seems likely that this first batch of trials convinced the Americans that the Canberra was ideal for the job, but in order to satisfy the US Senate a competitive evaluation of all likely contenders had to be arranged&quot;.

As part of the USAF&#x27;s evaluation process, all five aircraft were submitted to a series of fly-offs to determine their performance. On 21 February 1951, a Canberra B.2 (WD932), flown by Roland Beamont, made the transatlantic journey, arriving in the United States to participate in the competition; by making this journey, the Canberra became the first jet aircraft to perform a non-stop unrefueled flight across the Atlantic Ocean, travelling from Warton, England, to Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, in the record time of 4 hours 37 minutes. On 26 February 1951, the flyoff took place at Andrews Field, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland; each aircraft was tasked with performing a set sequence of maneuvers within a ten-minute window, directly demonstrating its agility and performance against its rivals. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Canberra proved to be significantly superior to any of the competing aircraft, and its selection was beyond doubt by the end of the competition.

===Production arrangements===
The Canberra was a foreign aircraft, which meant its superiority in terms of performance did not guarantee political support in spite of the urgent need, particularly in light of there being several rival indigenous aircraft designs. There were also doubts about production availability with English Electric being able to mesh with USAF demands, as well as questions over spare parts. In March 1951, many of these questions were answered; with production lines already at full capacity meeting Royal Air Force orders and those emerging from other export customers, English Electric entered into discussions with Glenn L. Martin Company. It was proposed that Martin would receive a license to build the Canberra in the United States. According to Gunston and Gilchrist, the Americanization of the Canberra program proved effective at dismissing much of the political opposition to the project.

On 23 March 1951, the USAF issued a contract to Martin, requesting the manufacturing of an initial quantity of 250 Canberras, which had received the USAF designation &quot;B-57A&quot; (Martin internally designated the type as the Model 272). On 3 April 1951, English Electric and Martin both signed a formal licensing agreement to cover the Canberra&#x27;s production.

During August 1951, a second British-built Canberra (WD940) was flown to the US to act as a pattern aircraft for Martin, as well as to perform assorted trials and to support performance validation of airframe changes. On 21 December 1951, one of the British pattern aircraft (WD932) was lost in an accident; although this was subsequently discovered to be caused by incorrect fuel scheduling having led to the tail-heavy aircraft exceeding its design limits during a maneuver, the crash jeopardized the entire program and invigorated the anti-Canberra political opposition. The crash did lead to some design changes in the face of political pressure, but these were not implemented on the first 75 aircraft to be produced.

Due to the great urgency placed on delivering the B-57A Canberra, the initial phase of manufacturing performed by Martin used a minimum-change formula to expedite production; thus the first B-57As to be produced were largely identical to the Canberra B.2. As such, more than 30 changes that had been requested by the Wright Air Development Center (WADC) were rejected on program schedule or cost grounds. One noticeable exception was the adoption of more powerful Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire engines capable of producing 7,200 lbf (32 kN) of thrust, which were license-built in the United States as the Wright J65. The Sapphire-based J65 powerplant had been selected in place of the British-built Canberra&#x27;s Rolls-Royce Avons as the USAF had placed an emphasis on operations within hot climates and intended to fly at a slightly higher maximum gross weight than the RAF&#x27;s operating practices.

Several other minor differences were also present between early US-built and UK-built Canberras. These changes included the canopy and fuselage windows being slightly revised, the crew being reduced from three to two, the adoption of wingtip fuel tanks, engine nacelles were modified with additional cooling scoops, and the conventional &quot;clamshell&quot; bomb bay doors were replaced with a low-drag rotating door originally designed for the XB-51. As a result of these changes, the bomb bay of the US-built aircraft was slightly smaller than its UK-built counterparts in order to allow the American aircraft to carry more fuel; however, the overall external shape of the Canberra remained unchanged.

In early July 1953, the first US-built production aircraft (52-1418) rolled out; it conducted its maiden flight on 20 July 1953. One month later, this initial production aircraft was accepted by the USAF, by which point a cessation of hostilities had come into effect in Korea. This was one of only eight B-57A Canberras to be manufactured; the remaining 67 aircraft from this first batch, deemed no longer to be required as bombers, were converted on the assembly line to serve as medium-altitude reconnaissance aircraft while retaining all the basic Canberra features, and were accordingly re-designated as the &quot;RB-57A&quot; Canberra.

===Further development===

In place of the curtailed B-57A, a more refined bomber variant, the &quot;B-57B&quot;, was developed. Having a more lengthy development time, this model incorporated the structural and system changes that had been recommended by WADC, which resulted in the aircraft being more adaptable than its B-57A predecessor. Of the external changes, the most significant was the adoption of a fighter-style canopy accompanied by a flat-panel windshield and a tandem seating arrangement, providing for greater transparency and an improved view for both the pilot and navigator, as well as allowing it to be equipped with a gunsight. The corresponding glazed bombing nose of the B-57A was deleted along with the starboard crew entrance to the cockpit.

The B-57B introduced several other major changes. In terms of armaments, a total of four hardpoints attached to the outer wing panels were installed on this variant, capable of mounting external bombs and rockets. The B-57B was also furnished with a gun armament for strafing attacks. The first 90 aircraft to be produced were equipped with a total of eight 0.50 cal (12.7 mm) Browning machine guns installed within the wings; on later aircraft these were replaced by an arrangement of four 20 mm M39 cannon. A new rotary bomb door was adopted on the B-57B, which had originally been designed for the XB-51, replacing the hinged doors; this proved to be faster to open/close and reduced buffeting, which in turn improved accuracy and allowed for faster attack speeds. The redesigned bomb bay also enabled faster turnaround times on the ground.

In addition, hydraulically-operated triangular air brakes were installed on the rear fuselage, which worked in addition to the existing &#x27;finger&#x27;-type brakes installed in the wings; the new brakes gave the pilots a greater level of controllability, improving the accuracy of low-level bombing runs. The B-57B was equipped with an APW-11 Bombing Air Radar Guidance System for target approach guidance, as well as an APS-54 radar warning receiver. The engines were also furnished with a new cartridge starting system, eliminating the reliance on ground start carts.

The substantial design changes between the B-57A and B-57B models resulted in delays to the overall program, as well as incurring substantial costs on the fixed-price contract. Gunston and Gilchrist stated of the consequences to the program: &quot;This was clearly not the manufacturer&#x27;s fault, but the money effectively ran out after 177 of the planned 250-aircraft order had been completed&quot;. In 1954, in response to the sound performance offered by the B-57B, the USAF elected to place a large second order; this included a further 100 B-57B bombers, 38 B-57C trainers, and 20 RB-57D high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. In 1955, a final batch of 68 B-57E target tugs was ordered.

In 1969, in response to demands for a capable night interdiction aircraft for combat operations in Southeast Asia, a total of 16 B-57B Canberras were substantially rebuilt during a lengthy upgrade program. These aircraft received an entirely new nose section containing an AN/ANQ-139 forward-looking radar, a low-light television system, and an AN/AAS-26 forward-looking infrared detector. A laser rangefinder/designator was also installed, and the wing pylons modified to accommodate laser-guided Paveway bombs, while all the guns were removed to save weight. During the production run from 1953 to 1957, a total of 403 B-57s were built.

==Operational history==


The B-57A was not considered combat-ready by the USAF and the aircraft were used solely for testing and development. One of the aircraft was given to the U.S. Weather Bureau which fitted it with a new nose radome and used it to track hurricanes. The aircraft was placed into limited production. Particularly contentious were the cockpit arrangement and the lack of guns, the Canberra having been designed as a high-speed, high altitude bomber rather than for close air support. The definitive &quot;B-57B&quot;, which introduced numerous improvements, made its first flight on 18 June 1954. The aircraft initially suffered from the same engine malfunctions as the RB-57As and several were lost in high-speed low-level operations due to a faulty tailplane actuator which caused the aircraft to dive into the ground. The USAF came to consider the B-57B as being inadequate for the night intruder role and thus Martin put all aircraft through an extensive avionics upgrade in response. Regardless, by the end of 1957, the USAF tactical squadrons were being re-equipped with supersonic North American F-100 Super Sabres. The complete retirement was delayed, however, by the start of the Vietnam War.

===Reconnaissance and electronic warfare B-57s===
While the USAF found the B-57A lacking, the photo reconnaissance &quot;RB-57A&quot; saw some operational use. First flying in October 1953, RB-57As fully equipped the 363rd Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at Shaw Air Force Base by July 1954. The aircraft were also deployed with USAF squadrons in West Germany, France and Japan. However, operational readiness was poor and the aircraft suffered from significant production delays because of engine problems. Wright had subcontracted production of J65 engines to Buick, which resulted in slow deliveries and a tendency for engine oil to enter the bleed air system, filling the cockpit with smoke. The problems were ameliorated when Wright took over engine production in 1954. RB-57As also suffered from a high accident rate caused in part by poor single-engine handling. This resulted in the entire fleet spending much of 1955 on the ground. By 1958, all RB-57A craft were replaced in active service by the Douglas RB-66B and McDonnell RF-101A. Air National Guard (ANG) units extensively used the RB-57A for photographic surveys of the United States until 1971.

A number of modified RB-57As were used by the 7499th Support Group at Wiesbaden AB, West Germany in Operation &quot;Heart Throb&quot; reconnaissance missions over Europe. Ten aircraft were pulled off Martin&#x27;s production line and modifications were performed in August 1955 by the Wright Air Development Center and by Martin. All equipment not absolutely essential for the daytime photography role was eliminated. The bomb bay door was removed and the area was skinned over. The seat for the system operator/navigator was removed, and an optical viewfinder was installed in the nose so that the pilot could perform all the reconnaissance duties without the assistance of the navigator. The clear plexiglass nose cone was replaced by an opaque fiberglass cone, but with a small optical glass window cut for the viewfinder. The plane&#x27;s J65-BW-5s were replaced by higher-thrust J65-W-7s. The aircraft was referred to as RB-57A-1. The weight reduction program shaved 5665 pounds off the weight of the RB-57A, and the ceiling was increased by 5000 feet.

Two RB-57A-1s were used by the Republic of China Air Force for reconnaissance missions over China; one was shot down by a Chinese Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 on 18 February 1958 and the pilot killed. In 1959, two RB-57Ds were delivered to replace the A-types; one of them was shot down over China by a SA-2 Guideline missile, marking the first successful operational engagement of surface-to-air missiles. Two other RB-57As were used by the Federal Aviation Administration to plan high-altitude airways for the upcoming jet passenger aircraft.

Starting in 1959, Martin began to modify retired RB-57As with electronic countermeasures (ECM) equipment in the bomb bay. Redesignated EB-57A, these aircraft were deployed with Defense Systems Evaluation Squadrons which played the role of aggressors to train the friendly air defense units in the art of electronic warfare. Subsequent bomber variants were also modified to fulfill this role. Although initially conducted by active duty Air Force units, the EB-57 mission eventually migrated to selected ANG units. The ANG&#x27;s EB-57s were replaced, in the 1980s, by the USAF&#x27;s more advanced General Dynamics/Grumman EF-111A Raven operated by the active-duty USAF.

Strategic Air Command employed 20 RB-57D aircraft from 1956 until 1964. Little is known about their use. The aircraft were retired due to structural fatigue and the advent of the U-2 and SR-71.

===High-altitude atmospheric research WB-57s===
Since the early 1970s two WB-57F Canberras (NASA 926 and NASA 928) were flown and maintained by NASA for high altitude atmospheric research. These same two aircraft have also been deployed alternately to Afghanistan for use as communications platforms that fly high over an area linking various communications devices on the battlefield and to other airborne assets, they were known as the Battlefield Airborne Communications Node system (BACN). In 2011 it was determined that a third aircraft was needed to satisfy mission requirements and an additional WB-57 was removed from the 309th AMARG after over 40 years at Davis-Monthan AFB and returned to flight status in August 2013 as NASA 927. Two of the NASA WB-57F&#x27;s were flown in a scientific mission tracking the solar eclipse on 8 April 2024. They flew approximately 5 to 6 miles apart at 460 mph along the path of the eclipse, starting off the coast of Mexico, with around 6 1/2 to 7 minutes of time within the shadow of the eclipse. 

===Vietnam War===


====Patricia Lynn Project====

Although intended as a bomber and never before deployed by the USAF to a combat zone, the first B-57s to be deployed to South Vietnam were not operated in an offensive role. The need for additional reconnaissance assets, especially those capable of operating at night, led to the deployment of two RB-57E aircraft on 15 April 1963. The USAF had awarded General Dynamics a contract to modify two B-57Es (55-4243, 55–4245) as all-weather high-altitude strategic reconnaissance aircraft. Under project &quot;Patricia Lynn&quot; these aircraft provided infrared coverage using their Reconofax VI cameras.

General Dynamics was chosen to modify the B-57E as it had extensive experience modifying Canberras with the RB-57D and RB-57F projects and turning the B-57 into a high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft. The forward nose section of the B-57Es were modified to house a KA-1 36-inch forward oblique camera and a low panoramic KA-56 camera used on the Lockheed U-2. Mounted inside the specially configured bomb bay door was a KA-1 vertical camera, a K-477 split vertical day-night camera, an infrared scanner, and a KA-1 left oblique camera. The modified aircraft were redesignated RB-57E.

The 2nd Air Division was desperate for tactical intelligence and on arrival the pilots that ferried in the RB-57Es were immediately assigned to the Division as combat crews and briefed on missions by Divisional intelligence officers on the reconnaissance flights they would make.

The first mission was flown on 7 May 1963 by the highly classified Patricia Lynn squadron (Detachment 1, 33d Tactical Group, later 6250th Combat Support Group, later 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing) operating from Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The Detachment flew nighttime reconnaissance missions to identify Viet Cong (VC) base camps, small arms factories and storage and training areas. The sorties yielded results that heretofore only had been wished for. The nighttime imagery showed VC training and base camps; small, hidden factories and storage dumps that RF-101 Voodoo crews had flown over during the day and had been unable to locate from the air. The existing RF-101s in 1963 could only photograph a few kilometers (they had to fly very low) per flight with their cameras. The RB-57Es could image the whole border with Cambodia in 2 1/2 flights at to with superior results.

From then on, Patricia Lynn crews flew both night and day missions over South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and areas of North Vietnam until 1971. The RB-57Es carried the call-sign &quot;Moonglow&quot;. Some missions were flown at low-level over single targets, others consisted of 4–6 specific targets. At night RB-57Es flew the canals and rivers in the Mekong Delta and southern part of South Vietnam. The sampans were easy to spot with the &quot;real time&quot; IR if the crew could keep over the canal which was difficult in the darkness.

The United States began Operation Steel Tiger over the Laos Panhandle and the Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) on 3 April 1965, to locate and destroy enemy forces and materiel being moved southward at night into South Vietnam, and to fly bomb damage assessment reconnaissance runs over targets attacked in the secret war the United States fought there. These flights teamed with B-57B bombers operating out of Bien Hoa Air Base and a C-130 Hercules flare ship. Three more aircraft were subsequently modified in 1964/65 bringing the number of aircraft to five.

Two RB-57Es were lost in combat operations. The first (S/N 55-4243) was lost as a result of a fuselage fire caused by small arms while on a low level reconnaissance mission in August 1965. The crew ejected safely when near Tan Son Nhut Air Base. The second aircraft (S/N 55-4264) was lost on 21 October 1968, after an engine fire started by ground fire forced the crew to eject.

A sixth Patricia Lynn aircraft (55–4257) joined the team in 1968, as a replacement for the combat losses. This aircraft had a Terrain-following radar designed to allow the aircraft to fly at a constant altitude, which would, in theory, produce better reconnaissance photos. Unfortunately, the aircraft flew so low (500–1000 feet) that the infrared film was used up before the entire assessment area could be photographed.

A 1968 update, under the Compass Eagle program, gave the back-seater a video display to monitor the IR scanner system. This allowed the crew to call in strikes on targets in real time, instead of having to return to base to get imagery developed, by which time the enemy would have likely moved on.

There were frequent changes and updating of the equipment, including the installation of 12-inch focal length KA-82 and 24-inch focal length KA-83 cameras. The infrared equipment was useful in spotting VC river traffic at night along the Mekong Delta southeast of Saigon.

In 1969/70, Patricia Lynn missions were flown into Laos and into Cambodia including Operation Barrel Roll strikes in 1969. The Patricia Lynn operation was terminated in mid-1971 with the inactivation of the 460th TRW and the four surviving aircraft returned to the United States.

Known RB-57E Patricia Lynn aircraft were:
* Martin B-57E-MA 55-4243 Modified to RB-57E in 1963. Lost in combat with Detachment 1, 6250th Combat Support Group, when hit by ground fire 5 August 1965 and caught fire while on return to base.
* Martin B-57E-MA 55–4245. Modified to RB-57E in 1963. Returned to CONUS June 1971. Converted to WB-57E. Retired to MASDC as BM0069 15 June 1972.
* Martin B-57E-MA 55–4237. Modified to RB-57E in 1964. Returned to CONUS June 1971. Converted to WB-57E. Retired to MASDC as BM0070 28 June 1972.
* Martin B-57E-MA 55–4249. Modified to RB-57E in 1964. Returned to CONUS June 1971. Converted to WB-57E. Retired to MASDC as BM0068 15 June 1972.
* Martin B-57E-MA 55–4264. Modified to RB-57E in 1965. Lost in combat with Detachment 1, 460th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, 25 October 1968 after being hit by ground fire 3 mi SW of Truc Giang, South Vietnam. Both crews ejected safely and were rescued.
* Martin B-57E-MA 55–4257. Modified to RB-57E in 1968. Equipped with terrain-following radar. Converted to EB-57E in 1971 and transferred to ADC 4677th Defense Systems Evaluation Squadron, Hill AFB, Utah. Retired to MASDC in 1979.

Later in August 1965, a single RB-57F would be deployed to Udorn, RTAB in an attempt to gather information about North Vietnamese SAM sites, first under &quot;project Greek God&quot; and then under &quot;project Mad King&quot;. In December another RB-57F would be deployed for this purpose, under &quot;project Sky Wave&quot;. Neither project garnered useful results and they were terminated in October 1965 and February 1966 respectively.

====Bombing and interdiction====
The deployment of actual combat capable B-57Bs from 8th and 13th Bomb Squadrons to Bien Hoa Air Base in August 1964 began with two aircraft lost and one damaged in collisions on arrival. An additional five aircraft were destroyed with another 15 damaged by a VC mortar attack in November of the same year. Low level sorties designated as training flights were conducted with the hope of it having a psychological effect. As a result, the first combat mission was only flown on 19 February 1965. The first excursion into North Vietnam took place on 2 March as part of Operation Rolling Thunder. The aircraft typically carried nine 500 lb (227 kg) bombs in the bomb bay and four 750 lb (340 kg) bombs under the wings. In April, Canberras began flying night intruder missions supported by USAF&#x27;s Fairchild C-123 Provider or C-130 Hercules flare ships and USN&#x27;s EF-10B Skyknight electronic warfare aircraft.

B-57s were primarily used for dive bombing and strafing, with the early models mounting eight .50 caliber machine guns, four per wing. Later models mounted four 20mm cannons, two per wing, for strafing. These weapons combined with their bomb loads and four hours of flight time made them excellent ground support aircraft, as well as exceptional truck killers along the Ho Chi Minh trail. Deployed along the &quot;trail&quot; for much of their eight years in Vietnam, Canberras participated in truck hunting campaigns during operations Barrel Roll, Steel Tiger, and &quot;Tiger Hound&quot;, gaining reputations with their &quot;Centurion Club&quot; which consisted of Canberra crews which attained 100 truck kills.

On 16 May 1965, an armed B-57B exploded on the runway at Biên Hòa, setting off a chain reaction that destroyed 10 other Canberras, 11 Douglas A-1 Skyraiders, and one Vought F-8 Crusader. Due to combat attrition, in October 1966, B-57Bs were transferred to Phan Rang where they supported operations in the Iron Triangle along with Australian-built Canberra B.20s of No. 2 Squadron RAAF. The aircraft also continued to fly night interdiction missions against the Ho Chi Minh trail. Of the 94 B-57Bs deployed to Southeast Asia, 51 were lost in combat and seven other Canberras were lost to other causes. Only nine were still flying by 1969.

B-57s returned to Southeast Asia in the form of the &quot;Tropic Moon III&quot; B-57G, deployed to Thailand in late 1970. Intended as a night intruder to help combat movement along the Ho Chi Minh trail, these aircraft were equipped with a variety of new sensors and other equipment, and were capable of dropping laser guided munitions. The relative kill rates per sortie during Operation Commando Hunt V between the B-57G and the AC-130A/E showed that the former was not as suited to the role of truck hunter. An attempt to combine both led to one B-57G being modified to house a special bomb bay installation of one Emerson TAT-161 turret with a single M61 20mm cannon as a gunship under project &quot;Pave Gat&quot;. After delays in testing at Eglin AFB, Florida, due to competition for mission time from the &quot;Tropic Moon III&quot; B-57Gs, &quot;Pave Gat&quot; tests proved &quot;that the B-57G could hit stationary or moving targets with its 20mm gun, day or night. Loaded with 4,000 rounds of ammunition, the &quot;Pave Gat&quot; B-57G could hit as many as 20 targets, three times as many as the bomb-carrying B-57G. The &quot;Pave Gat&quot; aircraft could avoid antiaircraft fire by firing from offset positions, while the bomb carrier had to pass directly over the target.&quot; Deployment to SEA was resisted, however, by the Seventh and Thirteenth Air Forces and others as the decision had been made in August 1971 to return the B-57G squadron to the U.S. in early 1972, leaving insufficient evaluation time. &quot;Project Pave Gat&quot; was terminated 21 December 1971. The B-57G was removed from Thailand in May 1972. Plans remained for the continuation of the B-57G program but post-conflict spending cuts forced the abandonment of these plans.
For a short period Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) personnel operated four B-57B aircraft. The RVNAF never officially took control of the aircraft, and, after accidents and other problems, including apparent claims by RVNAF pilots that the B-57 was beyond their physical capabilities, the program was terminated in April 1966, and the aircraft were returned to their original USAF units.

A total of 58 B-57 Canberras were recorded as having been lost during the Vietnam War; of these, 26 were lost to ground fire, five were lost to mortar fire and ground attack, four were lost to mid-air collision, ten were lost to airfield accidental bomb explosion, seven were lost to operational causes, and six were lost due to unknown causes.

===Pakistan===
The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was the other main user of the B-57 and made use of it in two wars with India. In the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, B-57s flew 167 sorties, dropping over 600 tons of bombs. Three B-57s were lost in action (only one as a result of enemy action), along with one RB-57F electronic intelligence aircraft. During the war, the bomber wing of the PAF attacked the concentration of airfields in north India. To avoid enemy fighter-bombers, the B-57s operated from several different airbases, taking off from and returning to different bases. The B-57 bombers would arrive over their targets in a stream at intervals of about 15 minutes, which led to achieving a major disruption of the overall IAF effort. The then unknown Pakistani pilot, 8-Pass Charlie, (Squadron Leader Najeeb Ahmad Khan, Sitara-e-Jurrat) was named by his adversaries for making eight passes in the moonlight, to bomb different targets with each of the B-57&#x27;s bombs.

During the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the PAF again made use of the B-57. On the first night, 12 IAF runways were targeted and a total of 183 bombs were dropped rendering the Indian airfields useless for 6 hours to 6 days. As the war progressed, PAF B-57s carried out many night missions. There was a higher attrition rate than in 1965, with at least five B-57s being put out of service by the end of the war.

PAF&#x27;s B-57 Squadron was the first to form a regular formation aerobatics team of four such aircraft.

They were retired from PAF service in 1985.

<text>Angelo d&#x27;Arrigo (April 3, 1961 – March 26, 2006) was an Italian aviator who held a number of world records in the field of flight, principally with microlights and hang gliders, with and without motors. He has been referred to as the &quot;Human Condor&quot;.

==Biography==

D&#x27;Arrigo was born in Catania, Sicily but grew up from a very early age in Paris, as his parents emigrated there in search of work. He returned to Sicily after graduating from the university in Paris, and from his base on Mt. Etna gained a number of world records and world titles in the field of ultra light flying and free flying.

In 2001 he initiated a sequence of breath-taking events which saw him flying alongside various birds of prey as he attempted to learn from them their techniques for migratory flight by taking advantage of thermal air currents for long distance flight with low energy consumption.

In 2002 he crossed the Sahara and the Mediterranean with an eagle. His hang glider was launched from a microlight driven by Richard Meredith-Hardy.

In 2003 he flew 5,500 kilometres from northern Siberia to the Caspian Sea in Iran in the company of a flock of Siberian cranes who had been born in captivity and, due to imprinting, considered him their parent. The bird is at risk of extinction, and, in order to try to save the species, Russian ornithologists hatched a plan. It called for having the eggs incubated under Angelo&#x27;s hang-glider, so the chicks saw this as they hatched. Angelo would then be with the chicks as they fledge. When they were ready to fly, they would fly alongside Angelo so they would consider him their mentor. That way, he could show them the traditional migratory route for their species. They had no other way to learn it. This approach was similar to the one taken in the movie &quot;Fly Away Home&quot;.

In 2004, he was aerotowed by Richard Meredith-Hardy and released over Mount Everest another world record. He reportedly made this flight over the summit of Everest with a trained Nepalese eagle. However, there were no eyewitnesses to this achievement, even though climbers saw and photographed Meredith-Hardy&#x27;s microlight aircraft. No evidence in the form of videos or photography has ever been brought forward, either, despite the fact that d&#x27;Arrigo&#x27;s hang-glider was equipped with three video cameras and two still cameras. The story is fully narrated in the documentary &quot;Flying Over Everest&quot; by director Fabio Toncelli.

In 2006 he followed the migratory routes of the condor over Aconcagua in the Andean Cordillera, the highest mountain in the Americas.

==Death==

In March 2006, he died in an accident during an airshow at Comiso, Italy, at the age of 44. A small Sky Arrow airplane, in which he was a passenger, fell to the ground. Both d&#x27;Arrigo and the pilot, a general of the Italian Air Force and ex-test pilot, were killed on impact. At the time of his death, Angelo was engaged in planning an expedition to Peru to re-introduce two Andean condors bred in captivity and raised by d&#x27;Arrigo at his home on Mount Etna. A documentary about this was being made at the time. It was called &quot;Born to Fly&quot;.

In memory of her husband, his widow Laura instituted a charity, the Fondazione Angelo d&#x27;Arrigo, with the aim of helping children in Peru. Angelo d&#x27;Arrigo was posthumously given the alternative sportsperson&#x27;s award at the 2006 Laureus World Sports Awards.

<text>The following is a list of organizations in the TV series, &quot;Alias&quot;.

==Alliance of Twelve==
The Alliance of Twelve is a fictional international organized crime group in the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. It is involved in the trade of intelligence and weapons as well as in blackmail. SD-6 is one of its subsidiary cells. The organization was founded by Alain Christophe, once a CIA counterintelligence officer, as well as other former agents of various other intelligence agencies and wealthy individuals investing in the spy trade after the Cold War. The Alliance of Twelve is an enemy of the United States and a rival to the CIA.

===Organizational structure===
The Alliance is led by a board of directors, one of them being Arvin Sloane. Some members are from the private sector, but most are former intelligence officers. All of them are wealthy. The organization is divided into 12 sections, named SD-1 through SD-12. &quot;SD&quot; stands for &quot;Section Disparu&quot; – literally, &quot;the section which has disappeared&quot; in French (Sydney translates it as &quot;the section that doesn&#x27;t exist&quot; in the episode &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;), this was coined by founder Alain Christophe. These organizational cells are spread over 12 major cities of the world. The Alliance takes in recruits and tricks them to believe they are working for the CIA when in reality they are not.

===Objectives===
The purview of the Alliance is the black market trading of weapons, military secrets, industrial intelligence, medical technology, computer advances, and political agendas. Its clients include governments, corporations, wealthy citizens, and families.

The Alliance aims to eventually reach world domination through its control over organized crime and the trade of intelligence. According to Jack Bristow and Arvin Sloane, the Alliance once wished to change the world when it had achieved this, and rid the world of corruption, but had become bloated and corrupt over the years, diverging from their original vision and focusing instead on profit.

===Actions===
According to Sydney Bristow in the episode &quot;Q and A&quot;, the Alliance of Twelve was responsible for the carbon proxy disaster in 1992, in which an accidental methyl isocyanate leak at the manufacturer plant in Bhopal, Madhyapradesh, India killed three thousand people and injured another thousand, leaving them disabled. In 1996, near Kyoto, Japan, a bullet train accidentally switched tracks and derailed, killing a hundred and fifty people. The Alliance was also responsible for that disaster. In 2001, the Alliance caused a transport plane in Germany to suffer mechanical failures outside Munich, killing twelve people. The disasters were falsely believed to have been accidents. In truth, some were acts of revenge, others were personal favors to those who helped fund the Alliance. Some were distractions so that local resources were occupied so that SD-4 or SD-7 could infiltrate a building somewhere and retrieve sensitive data.

===SD-6===
SD-6, headed by Arvin Sloane and based in Los Angeles, is the focus of the first two seasons of &quot;Alias&quot;. SD-6 pretends to be part of the CIA and states its objective as &quot;retrieval and study of intelligence both military and industrial throughout the world that is critical to the superiority and survival of the United States of America.&quot; Even its own members, initially including agent Sydney Bristow, believe it is a black ops division of the CIA; and only a handful of senior staff know the truth and are complicit in the deception. The name &quot;SD-6&quot; derives from the French, &quot;Section Disparu&quot;, which, in character Sydney Bristow&#x27;s words, means &quot;The Section that doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot;

In the first episode of &quot;Alias&quot;, Sydney learns from her father, Jack, about the organization&#x27;s true character as a part of The Alliance of Twelve.

During the course of the first season, other heads of the SD cells are eventually shown meeting. Among them was Edward Poole, head of SD-9 (played by Roger Moore), who manages to convince Sloane to kill fellow SD head Jean Briault to influence an upcoming vote on whether to declare war on Alexander Khasinau, who has eliminated rival groups FTL and K-Directorate. Another SD leader is identified by the first name &quot;Ramon,&quot; but his last name and his SD cell number are unrevealed.

===Paranoia and ruthlessness===

==== Of SD-6 ====
SD-6 branch was headquartered in the Credit Dauphine building in Los Angeles, with entry through a special elevator to the sixth sub-level of the building. Every person who entered would be biometrically scanned and visually confirmed. As a security measure, all three areas of the foundations of the building itself were rigged with C-4 explosives that would go off if the inner vault had been breached during a security lockdown or for other contingencies. Fail-safe or lockdown procedures could be carried out only by Arvin Sloane, using his right index fingerprint; presumably, other SD cells had similar contingency plans (such as for deterring a CIA raid, which happens in Season 2) that would make it difficult to shut down.

In addition, SD-6 employed an internal security group responsible for investigating and terminating individuals who even know of SD-6&#x27;s existence, those believed to know about the true nature of SD-6, or those suspected to be Double agents or traitors to SD-6. Sydney&#x27;s fiancée, Danny, was murdered by SD-6&#x27;s internal security division in Season 1 after Sydney revealed to him that she works for SD-6, believing it to be a part of the CIA.

==== Of The Alliance ====
In addition to the cell-like nature of &quot;Section Disparu&quot;, which presumably allows the termination of entire SD cells in the event that it is wholly compromised, the Alliance of Twelve is an utterly ruthless organization that constantly suspects and conduct surveillance of even its head members.

When Arvin Sloane&#x27;s wife, Emily, admits to knowing of the existence of SD-6, Arvin is told to have his wife killed as a test of loyalty. Arvin was able to win a temporary reprieve because of his wife&#x27;s cancer which would kill her soon; when her cancer is found to be in remission, he is again told that in order to become a &quot;full partner&quot; in The Alliance, he would have to kill his wife. He then faked his wife&#x27;s death by drugging her wine and putting her in suspended animation.

Having proven his loyalty to the members of The Alliance, he is welcomed as a full partner and injected in the neck with a tracking device and mini-microphone to have his movements and conversations recorded 24/7. Although Sloane was clearly privy to matters that only a handful of men and women knew about, he was clearly not yet part of an &#x27;inner circle&#x27; within The Alliance board, suggesting that there is some sense of competition and suspicion among the SD cells and their leaders.

===The end of The Alliance===
The Alliance came to an end in the middle of Season 2 (Episode 13, &quot;Phase One&quot;) of &quot;Alias&quot; when Sydney stumbles upon information, with Sark&#x27;s aid, that leads her and Vaughn to believe there is one master server, server 47 (in keeping with the Rambaldi sub-plot of the show, where 47 is a key number in Rambaldi&#x27;s works), which could potentially have all the information the CIA would need to shut down all of the SD cells simultaneously, thus acting as a sort of &#x27;silver bullet&#x27; to the cell-like nature of the Alliance.

Although the server was located on a Boeing 747 plane that was constantly airborne as a security measure, Sydney was able to pose as an escort for the computer technicians on board during one of its landings and copy all the information from the server. When Jack attempted to go back to SD-6 headquarters to get confirmation that the information was genuine (as the CIA would only have one chance), he was apprehended by the acting head Geiger (Sloane had taken off and was declared MIA by the Alliance) who accused him of being a CIA spy.

Knowing she could not go back herself, Sydney called her SD-6 partner Marcus Dixon to get the confirmation and tells Dixon the true nature of SD-6. With this information, the CIA was able to successfully raid all the offices of various SD cells around the world; Sydney was a part of the CIA team that infiltrated SD-6 headquarters in Los Angeles and rescued her father moments before he would be electrocuted by Geiger. It is then revealed that Sloane had planned the destruction of the Alliance, having a technician bypass the surveillance devices in his neck, and he and Sark had supplied Sydney with the information the CIA needed to remove The Alliance – after he had cleared out (apparently) all Rambaldi artifacts to his own location outside of SD-6. However, one artifact escaped Sloane&#x27;s attention. This artifact, the Horizon, had been sought by Prophet Five for thirty years, and was eventually retrieved (after coercing Sydney) by Irina Derevko, who then betrayed Prophet Five, almost four years after the fall of the Alliance.

==The Covenant==
The Covenant is a large, powerful, and secretive intelligence/terrorist organization.

The Covenant was a &quot;loose affiliation of Russian nationalists&quot; composed of retired KGB and former Central Committee members, all dedicated to the new world envisioned by Milo Rambaldi. It functioned much like an organized crime family. At one point, it had six cell leaders, until Julian Sark and Lauren Reed (a double agent in the United States National Security Council who was Michael Vaughn&#x27;s wife) assassinated them in a bid for power. The Covenant had secured Sark&#x27;s release to gain access to his wealth as a Romanov descendant. McKenas Cole had somehow managed to secure his own release and was now the second most powerful individual in the Covenant. During season 3, it was based in St. Petersburg. Two of its front companies were the Dryden Bank and Chantre Telecom.

Following the end of season 2 and prior to the beginning of season 3, The Covenant kidnapped Sydney Bristow and attempted to brainwash her into believing she was a Covenant agent. Sydney operated as a double agent for the CIA using the alias Julia Thorne for almost two years. Eventually, Sydney left the Covenant and had her memory of that time erased in an effort to prevent the Covenant from gaining a crucial Rambaldi artifact, later revealed to be the Sphere of Life. FBI Assistant Director Kendall later told Sydney about those missing years and how she was able to escape the Covenant with his help.

At the end of season 3 Lauren Reed was killed and Sark was captured. In season 4 the Covenant has disappeared as a threat, and Sark later referred to the &quot;implosion of the Covenant.&quot; However, the &quot;implosion&quot; was a ruse perpetrated by Elena Derevko, who was revealed to be the leader of the Covenant, and that Irina Derevko had actually been trying to prevent Elena&#x27;s endgame. Elena&#x27;s new headquarters is in Prague and was eventually raided; however, she managed to escape.

Elena&#x27;s endgame, based on her interpretation of one of Rambaldi&#x27;s prophecies, was an apocalypse called &quot;Il Diluvio&quot;, The Flood. Covenant operatives primed the world&#x27;s water with Rambaldi substances and Elena activated an enormous Mueller device in Sovogda, Russia. The device broadcast a frequency which caused those who had consumed the tainted water to go into a mindless rage. Elena&#x27;s intent was that, after the entire world&#x27;s population had been affected, the Earth would be &quot;cleansed&quot; with very few survivors. With the help of Irina, the APO team managed to prevent The Flood, and Irina killed Elena. However, Nadia Santos had been captured and injected with the tainted water and sent out to fight her sister Sydney, as foreseen by Rambaldi. Sydney only managed to survive with the intervention of Arvin Sloane, who shot Nadia and put her in a coma.

==Authorized Personnel Only==
Authorized Personnel Only (APO) is a fictional black ops unit within the Central Intelligence Agency in the American TV series &quot;Alias&quot;. It was formed at the beginning of Season 4 and is headquartered beneath the Los Angeles subway system.

===History and background===
Its first director was Arvin Sloane, who also gave the organization its name as an inside joke since the main entrance to APO&#x27;s headquarters was behind a maintenance door in the Los Angeles subway system marked &quot;Authorized Personnel Only&quot;. Concerned that increased public scrutiny of the CIA and resulting red tape has impeded their ability to do their job, the CIA asked Sloane to set up the covert unit as one that is still governed by U.S. laws, but unhampered by bureaucratic chain of command with no accountability except to themselves. Sloane was chosen because of his experience running SD-6, which successfully posed as a CIA black ops division for several years. All of its initial members were hand-picked by Sloane, and in order to maintain APO&#x27;s cover as a unit that officially doesn&#x27;t exist, all members from previous seasons officially resign from the CIA under varying circumstances to work for APO.

Although headed by Sloane, APO ultimately answered to CIA Director Hayden Chase, and at the end of Season 4, Sloane was removed from his post and replaced by Jack Bristow, who remained in charge of APO into Season 5. Sloane ultimately returned to APO as assistant director, although unknown to his colleagues he was now a mole for Prophet Five, a criminal organization that also pretended to be the CIA in order to recruit. Sloane was allowed back into APO in order to use its resources to find a cure for Nadia Santos, his daughter, after the events of the season 4 finale.

===Personnel===
The first agents recruited and their new call signs are:
*Jack Bristow – Raptor
*Sydney Bristow – Phoenix
*Michael Vaughn – Shotgun
*Marcus Dixon – Outrigger

Nadia Santos (Evergreen) later joined APO at her request. Marshall Flinkman (Merlin) was recruited to serve as tech support. Eric Weiss also became a member after crossing paths with Sydney and Vaughn during an APO mission.

In the fifth season, APO gained two new members following the apparent death of Michael Vaughn, Eric Weiss&#x27;s transfer to Washington D.C. and Nadia&#x27;s hospitalization for her illness. Thomas Grace (Sidewinder) was recruited from another division of the CIA, while Rachel Gibson (Oracle) was a former, unwitting agent of The Shed who thought she was working for the CIA while under Gordon Dean; Rachel essentially took over Sydney&#x27;s former role as the double agent in the enemy organization while Sydney acted as Rachel&#x27;s handler just as Vaughn was once hers, particularly since Sydney&#x27;s current pregnancy limited her abilities as a field agent.

As the series approached its finale, numerous changes occurred in APO. Arvin Sloane was removed as director and replaced by Jack Bristow. As Sloane&#x27;s endgame began to come to fruition, involving moles within the CIA itself, Bristow began to hide information from CIA oversight.

In the series finale, APO headquarters was destroyed by a large bomb planted in the subway by Julian Sark, who was working with Sloane. APO and the subway were evacuated, but agent Thomas Grace died in the blast. (The episode revealed that APO headquarters was within a few blocks of Los Angeles City Hall, meaning that APO must be in the Civic Center Station).

The series ends with a &quot;flash-forward&quot; to several years into the future (roughly 2014). Marcus Dixon is referred to as &quot;deputy director&quot; but it is not indicated whether APO still exists in this future time.

==Prophet Five==

The Shed is a fictional criminal operation in the television series &quot;Alias&quot;. The leader of the Shed was initially Gordon Dean, and later temporarily, Kelly Peyton, though her superiors warned her that any more betrayals would lead to severe consequences and they both ultimately answered to a larger group: Prophet Five. Prophet Five served as an Illuminati-like conspiracy group in the fifth season of &quot;Alias&quot;. The headquarters of Prophet Five was in Barcelona, Spain, with known Shed satellite offices in Prague, Cleveland, Seattle, Chicago and St. Louis.

===History and objectives===
Prophet Five was started in the 1970s by Oskar Mueller as a project funded by a private foundation. Parts of the project were compartmentalized, but it is known that the &quot;best and the brightest&quot; mathematicians, linguists, scientists, and cryptologists, including James Lehman and the father of André Michaux, were recruited to decrypt a section of a 15th-century manuscript known as the &quot;Profeta Cinque&quot; (Fifth Prophet) which was written in apparently unbreakable code. They succeeded, and discovered that the manuscript referenced proteins, nucleotides and amino acids – advanced genetics apparently ahead of its time. Lehman and Michaux assumed they were being tested, and presented their findings to a committee. The project was shut down and they were sent back to their everyday lives.

Meanwhile, Renée Rienne&#x27;s father, Luc Goursaud, was involved in another part of the project, as a test subject for clinical trials administered by Doctor Aldo Desantis. He was paid an impressive amount of money. It is unknown what he was tested for, but it is known that thirty years later, Desantis emerged from a cryogenic chamber looking identical to Renée&#x27;s father. It is likely that Prophet Five experimented on Renée&#x27;s father to develop experimental genetic doubling techniques, possibly based on Lehman and Michaux&#x27;s findings from the manuscript. Renée&#x27;s father somehow discovered something about the experiments that disturbed him, and he fled with his daughter across Europe, only to be taken away by Desantis. Renée witnessed this and swore revenge.

A few weeks after Lehman and Michaux shut down the project, Michaux contacted Lehman. He had begun to notice that those who they were told had worked on the project were starting to die in mysterious accidents. He would then change his name and go into hiding (as Bill Vaughn) and urge Lehman to do the same.

According to Irina Derevko most assumed Prophet Five to be a myth and discounted its existence, but around the time of the events occurring in Sovogda rumors arose that Prophet Five was real and had gone active once again. The group pursued the Horizon.

The key to finding this Rambaldi device lay with old SD-6 files. Prophet Five kidnapped and hypnotized Sydney Bristow, believing she had the knowledge from SD-6 that would aid in recovering the device. Sydney gave them fake coordinates, but her mother Irina tricked her into taking them to the real location of the Horizon, a safety deposit box in Vancouver. Irina betrayed Prophet Five and disappeared with the Horizon. Prophet Five&#x27;s endgame also revolved around 15th century prophet Milo Rambaldi, specifically his interest in Sydney, whom Rambaldi refers to as his &quot;Chosen One.&quot; Ultimately, Prophet Five&#x27;s endgame remains a mystery, as the Twelve were on Sloane&#x27;s orders. Since Irina and Sloane were apparently after immortality, it may be assumed the Twelve were after the secret as well.

===Structure and organization===
Prophet Five was led by a group of twelve, remarkably similar to the Alliance. In addition, the Shed operated similarly to SD-6, with most agents believing they were part of a black ops division of the CIA. Members have ties to British MI6, Russian SVR, French Intelligence, the Centers for Disease Control, pharmaceutical companies, and even the CIA. Prophet Five also had some connection with the government of North Korea, as Doctor Desantis was transported to a North Korean military facility after escaping Renée Rienne. Members of the Twelve controlled entire sectors of technology, finance, and defense. When Arvin Sloane is summoned to meet the twelve in Minsk, the twelve consist of 11 men and one woman.

<doc id="626802" wikidata="Q3589083" url="?curid=626802" title="Mahdia shipwreck">
<text>The shipwreck of Mahdia was found by Greek sponge fishermen off the coast of Tunisia in June 1907. The shipwreck near the modern town of Mahdia is dated to between 80 and 60 BC.

In a series of underwater campaigns, numerous items were recovered and placed on display at the Musée National du Bardo, Tunis. The greater part of the sculptures were salvaged between 1907 and 1913 by French archaeologist Alfred Merlin, at that time Director of Antiquities in the Protectorate of Tunisia. Further survey work on the site was done by a team led by Mensun Bound, but unfortunately no further excavations have been possible.

==Cargo==
A storm presumably drove the ship onto the north African coast en route from Piraeus, the port of Athens, to Italy, as it was carrying Greek works of art intended for Roman purchasers, marble and bronze sculptures, high-quality furniture fittings, decorative items, and architectural elements. These were later restored by researchers from the Rheinisches Landesmuseum Bonn in Germany. There were also several dozen heavy marble columns and parts of catapults.

It has been generally thought that the marble columns were removed and shipped by order of Lucius Cornelius Sulla after his sacking of Athens in 86 BC. None of the epic-scaled Homeric figures that gained popularity in the 1st century BC were to be found, nor any copies of Classical works of the 5th century, as Nikolaus Himmelmann pointed out, contrasting the Mahdia cargo with the similar cargo of the somewhat later Antikythera ship. Recovered was a marble bust probably of Ariadne, two large-scale bronzes, a herm figure of a turbaned Dionysus, inscribed with the name of its maker, Boëthos of Chalcedon, and a lithe, winged olive-wreathed boy, identified by scholars as Agon or Eros Enagonios, Eros as lord of contests, a bronze bust of Ariadne, and two bronze figurines of dancing dwarfs.

Among five smaller bronzes, found at the site in 1910, was the satyr illustrated at right. The site also contained lead objects, including anchors, tubes, and plates, and ingots that, according to their isotope-composition, seem to come from the Sierra de Cartagena in Spain.

<doc id="626808" wikidata="Q713298" url="?curid=626808" title="Geomungo">
<text>The geomungo, alternate name hyeongeum, is a traditional Korean plucked zither with both bridges and frets. &quot;Geomungo&quot; is a representative stringed instrument made in Goguryeo before the 5th century. Scholars believe that the name refers to Goguryeo and translates to &quot;Goguryeo zither&quot; or that it refers to the colour and translates to &quot;black crane zither&quot; (&quot;hyeonhakgeum&quot;, / ).

The geomungo&#x27;s place in Korean culture is traditionally that of a scholars&#x27; instrument for self-cultivation, much like ancient Chinese had done with the guqin in China. However, the Koreans never adopted the guqin as a folk instrument but instead inherited the Confucian and literati guqin lore wholesale and applied it onto their own geomungo lore.

==History==

The &quot;geomungo&quot; originated circa the 4th century (see Anak Tomb No.3 infra) through the 7th century from the kingdom of Goguryeo, the northernmost of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, although the instrument can be traced back to the 4th century.

According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot; (Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms), written in 1145, the &quot;geomungo&quot; was invented in the 6th century by prime minister Wang San-ak by remodeling the form of the ancient Chinese instrument &quot;guqin&quot; (&quot;gogeum&quot;, also called &quot;chilhyeongeum&quot;, literally &quot;seven-string zither&quot;). After his death, the instrument was passed down to Ok Bogo, Son Myeong-deuk, Gwi Geum, An Jang, Cheong Jang, and Geuk Jong, while being widely spread over the kingdom. However, National Gugak Center of Korea raises the possibility that the geomungo originated from a traditional musical instrument of Goguryeo before Guqin was introduced. Meanwhile, Japanese scholars claim that the predecessor of geomungo was Wo Konghou(卧箜篌), a fretted bridge zither that was used in China since at least the Western Han Dynasty, and opinion about predecessor of Geomungo is still discussed among East Asian Scholars.
Archetype of the instrument is painted in Goguryeo tombs. They are found in the tomb of Muyongchong and Anak Tomb No.3.

==Construction==
The &quot;geomungo&quot; is approximately 162 cm long and 23 cm wide (63.75 inches long, 9 inches wide), and has movable bridges called &quot;anjok&quot; (雁足 &quot;goose feet&quot;) and 16 frets called &quot;gwae&quot; (棵; numbered 1 to 16 from left to right). It has a hollow body where the front plate of the instrument is made of paulownia wood and the back plate is made of hard chestnut wood. Its six strings, which are made of twisted silk passed through its back plate. The pick is made from bamboo sticks in the size of regular household pencil. Near the bridge is a leather-covered section called &quot;daemo&quot; to protect the surface from the striking of the &quot;suldae&quot; stick.

The six strings are named (from closest one to the player outward) &quot;munhyeon&quot; (文弦 &quot;civil string&quot;), &quot;yuhyeon&quot; (遊弦 &quot;roaming string&quot;), &quot;daehyeon&quot; (大弦 &quot;big string&quot;), &quot;gwaesangcheong&quot; (棵上清 &quot;clarity upon the frets&quot;), &quot;gwaehacheong&quot; (棵下清 &quot;clarity below the frets&quot;), and &quot;muhyeon&quot; (武弦 &quot;martial string&quot;), and are numbered 1 to 6 respectively in notation (or 文、方、大、上、中、下 in tablature form). Strings 2 to 4 go over fret 1 and are positioned over the frets whilst 1, 5, and 6 are supported by the &quot;anjok&quot; bridges. Strings 2 and 3 are used to play stopped notes and the rest are played open or as drones (even string 4 which is above the frets, though it is sometimes played stopped in some pieces). The thickness of the strings are not sequential: usually the thickest string is the &quot;daehyeon&quot;, followed by the &quot;munhyeon&quot; and &quot;muhyeon&quot;. The &quot;yuhyeo&quot; is usually the thinnest string followed by the &quot;gwaesangcheong&quot; and &quot;gwaehacheong&quot;, though some have the &quot;gwaesangcheong&quot; as the thinnest followed by the &quot;yuhyeon&quot;.

Modernized geomungo increases the strings to 11, which are made of nylon. As with the traditional version, three strings are over the frets and the others are all open. But the traditional version of the geomungo has 6 strings, with three over the frets.

Recently, the 6-string &quot;geomungo&quot; has been modified quite a lot, with the appearance of electronic geomungo (전자 거문고). The instrument has been played with a &quot;hwaldae&quot; bow (활대 거문고), similar to playing the &quot;ajaeng&quot;), and some versions have more strings. The Chinese wo konghou has 7 strings while the traditional geomungo only has 6 strings.

In the development of culture, besides the conservation artists, inheriting the cultural tradition of the nation, there are artists who change and modernize the traditional culture of the nation.

==Playing method==
The &quot;geomungo&quot; is generally played while seated on the floor. The strings are plucked with a short bamboo stick plectrum called (술대/匙), which is held between the index and middle fingers of the right hand, while the left-hand presses on the strings (mostly 2 and 3) by either pulling or pushing to produce various pitches using the thumb and first four fingers. The left-hand ring-finger usually wears a leather thimble (called &quot;golmu&quot;) to act as support as the strings are high above the frets and are difficult to press down firmly on the frets. The player can use the stick to strike the &quot;daemo&quot; leather protector during plucks to create percussive effects.

The most typical tuning of the open strings for the playing of traditional Korean court music is (from string closest to the player outwards) Eb, Ab, Db, Bb, Bb, and Bb an octave lower than the central tone. For sanjo and folk music, the Eb string is raised to F (plus all the strings might be raised a major 2nd up). The instrument is played in traditional Korean court music and the folk styles of sanjo and sinawi.

Due to its characteristically percussive sound and vigorous playing technique it is thought of as a more &quot;masculine&quot; instrument than the 12-string or 24 string gayageum (another Korean zither); both instruments, however, are played by both male and female performers.

The geomungo has a large range of playable songs and also has a large range of tunes.

The geomungo historically had a notation tablature system similar to that of the guqin Chinese seven-stringed zither &quot;jianzipu&quot; system, but this has been superseded by modern staff notation.

The Korean-born, U.S. resident &quot;geomungo&quot; performer and composer Jin Hi Kim plays a custom-made electric &quot;geomungo&quot; in addition to the regular instrument.

A geomungo was featured in Korean K-pop group Blackpink&#x27;s music video &quot;Pink Venom&quot;, played by Jisoo at the start of the video.

<text>Balvenie Castle is a ruined castle 1 km north of Dufftown in the Moray region of Scotland.

==History==
Originally known as &quot;Mortlach&quot;, it was built in the 12th century by a branch of the powerful Comyn family (the &quot;Black Comyns&quot;) and was extended and altered in the 15th and 16th centuries.

The castle fell out of use following an attack by Robert the Bruce in 1308, which left the property uninhabitable. At some point in the 14th century, the castle and estates of Balvenie passed to the Earl of Douglas. Nothing is documented as to how the Black Douglases first acquired the castle but the most likely account is that it came with the marriage of the heiress Joanna Murray to Archibald &quot; &#x27;the Grim&#x27; &quot;, 3rd Earl of Douglas in 1362. His son and successor Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas granted his younger brother James Douglas, 7th Earl of Douglas, latterly known as James &quot; &#x27;the Gross&#x27; &quot;, the lordship of Balvenie in 1408. James&#x27;s main residence was at Abercorn Castle, a coastal fortress to the west of Edinburgh and Balvenie Castle&#x27;s use was as temporary accommodation when the need arose.

In 1440, William Douglas, 6th Earl of Douglas, was killed by James the Gross, probably in a conspiracy with William Crichton and Alexander Livingston of Callendar, the guardians of the then child-king James II. James &#x27;the Gross then became the 7th earl. James immediately provided the lordship of Balvenie with its castle to his youngest son, John Douglas, Lord of Balvenie. Earl James&#x27;s death in 1443 signalled a resumption of the hostility between the royal Stewarts and the Black Douglases. The Battle of Arkinholm in May 1455 saw the defeat of this, the main Douglas line by an army loyal to James II. All of their lands and titles were forfeited to the Crown, including Balvenie Castle. King James divided up the estates among his supporters, which included the Douglas Earl of Angus and provided Balvenie Castle to Sir John Stewart, who later became the first Earl of Atholl.

William Duff committed suicide in the castle in 1718 and it was effectively abandoned at that point. It was used by Hanoverian forces as an encampment in 1746 during the second Jacobite rebellion.

Today, the remains of the castle are managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument. However, ownership continues in private hands; the current owner is Jeremy Duncan Nicholson, Baron of Balvenie, who resides in Atlanta, Georgia in the United States. The castle is open to the public from the beginning of April to the end of September.

Balvenie whisky is produced by William Grant &amp; Sons at the Balvenie distillery down the hill from the castle.

<doc id="626814" wikidata="Q4348" url="?curid=626814" title="TV tuner card">
<text>A TV tuner card is a kind of television tuner that allows television signals to be received by a computer. Most TV tuners also function as video capture cards, allowing them to record television programs onto a hard disk much like the digital video recorder (DVR) does.

 The interfaces for TV tuner cards are most commonly either PCI bus expansion card or the newer PCI Express (PCIe) bus for many modern cards, but PCMCIA, ExpressCard, or USB devices also exist. In addition, some video cards double as TV tuners, notably the ATI All-In-Wonder series. The card contains a tuner and an analog-to-digital converter (collectively known as the analog front end) along with demodulation and interface logic. Some lower-end cards lack an onboard processor and, like a Winmodem, rely on the system&#x27;s CPU for demodulation.

==Types==
There are many types of tuner cards.

===Analog tuners===
Analog television cards output a raw video stream, suitable for real-time viewing but ideally requiring some sort of video compression if it is to be recorded.

Some cards also have analog input (composite video or S-Video) and many also provide a radio tuner.

An early example was the Aapps Corp. &quot;MicroTV&quot; for Apple Macintosh II, which debuted in 1989.

More-advanced TV tuners encode the signal to Motion JPEG or MPEG, relieving the main CPU of this load.

===Hybrid tuners===
A hybrid tuner has one tuner that can be configured to act as an analog tuner or a digital tuner. Switching between the systems is fairly easy, but cannot be done immediately. The card operates as a digital tuner or an analog tuner until reconfigured.

===Combo tuners===

This is similar to a hybrid tuner, except there are two separate tuners on the card. One can watch analog while recording digital, or vice versa. The card operates as an analog tuner and a digital tuner simultaneously. The advantages over two separate cards are cost and utilization of expansion slots in the computer. As many regions around the world convert from analog to digital broadcasts, these tuners are gaining popularity.

Like the analog cards, the Hybrid and Combo tuners can have specialized chips on the tuner card to perform the encoding, or leave this task to the CPU. The tuner cards with this &#x27;hardware encoding&#x27; are generally thought of as being higher quality. Small USB tuner sticks have become more popular in 2006 and 2007 and are expected to increase in popularity. These small tuners generally do not have hardware encoding due to size and heat constraints.

While most TV tuners are limited to the radio frequencies and video formats used in the country of sale, many TV tuners used in computers use DSP, so a firmware upgrade is often all that&#x27;s necessary to change the supported video format. Many newer TV tuners have flash memory big enough to hold the firmware sets for decoding several different video formats, making it possible to use the tuner in many countries without having to flash the firmware. However, while it is generally possible to flash a card from one analog format to another due to the similarities, it is generally not possible to flash a card from one digital format to another due to differences in decode logic necessary.

==Radio tuners==
Many TV tuners can function as FM radios; this is because there are similarities between broadcast television and FM radio. The FM radio spectrum is close to (or even inside) that used by VHF terrestrial TV broadcasts. And many broadcast television systems around the world use FM audio. So listening to an FM radio station is simply a case of configuring existing hardware.

==Mobile TV adapter==
External TV tuner card attachments are available for mobile phones and also smartphones, for watching mobile TV, via TV stations on 1seg in Japan, Latin America and the Philippines. There was also a &quot;converter&quot; for watching DVB-H in Europe and elsewhere via Wi-Fi streaming video (PacketVideo).

== Video capture ==
Video capture cards are a class of video capture devices designed to plug directly into expansion slots in personal computers and servers. Models from many manufacturers are available; all comply with one of the popular host bus standards including PCI, newer PCI Express (PCIe) or AGP bus interfaces.

These cards typically include one or more software drivers to expose the cards&#x27; features, via various operating systems, to software applications that further process the video for specific purposes. As a class, the cards are used to capture baseband analog composite video, S-Video, and, in models equipped with tuners, RF modulated video. Some specialized cards support digital video via digital video delivery standards including serial digital interface (SDI) and, more recently, the emerging HDMI standard. These models often support both standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) variants.

While most PCI and PCI-Express capture devices are dedicated to that purpose, AGP capture devices are usually included with the graphics adapted on the board as an all-in-one package. Unlike video editing cards, these cards tend to not have dedicated hardware for processing video beyond the analog-to-digital conversion. Most, but not all, video capture cards also support one or more channels of audio. New technologies allow PCI-Express and HD-SDI to be implemented on video capture cards at lower costs than before.

An early example is the Mass Microsystems &quot;Colorspace FX&quot; card from 1989.

===Applications===
There are many applications for video capture cards, including converting a live analog source into some type of analog or digital media, (such as a VHS tape to a DVD), archiving, video editing, scheduled recording (such as a DVR), television tuning, or video surveillance. The cards may have significantly different designs to optimally support each of these functions. Capture cards can be used for recording a video game longplay (LP) so gamers can make walkthrough gameplay videos.

One of the most popular applications for video capture cards is to capture video and audio for live Internet video streaming. The live stream can also be simultaneously archived and formatted for video on demand. The capture cards used for this purpose are typically purchased, installed, and configured in host PC systems by hobbyists or systems integrators. Some care is required to select suitable host systems for video encoding, particularly HD applications which are more affected by CPU performance, number of CPU cores, and certain motherboard characteristics that heavily influence capture performance.

<text>The shipwreck of Rochelongue, located west of Cap d&#x27;Agde in southwestern France, dates to the Iron Age, c. 600 BCE. Its cargo included 800 kg of copper ingots and about 1,700 bronze artefacts, including axe heads, other tools, and chains. The ingots have been analyzed by the SAM Project, and found to contain very pure copper with traces of lead, antimony, nickel and silver.

The artefacts are on display in the Agde Museum, which also houses the Youth of Agde, a Hellenistic statue recovered from the river Herault (where it was probably deposited by a different, later shipwreck.)

<doc id="626817" wikidata="Q1066778" url="?curid=626817" title="Languages of the Philippines">
<text>There are some 130 to 195 languages spoken in the Philippines, depending on the method of classification. Almost all are Malayo-Polynesian languages native to the archipelago. A number of Spanish-influenced creole varieties generally called Chavacano along with some local varieties of Chinese are also spoken in certain communities. The 1987 constitution designates Filipino, a de facto standardized version of Tagalog, as the national language and an official language along with English. Filipino is regulated by Commission on the Filipino Language and serves as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; used by Filipinos of various ethnolinguistic backgrounds.

Republic Act 11106 declares Filipino Sign Language or FSL as the country&#x27;s official sign language and as the Philippine government&#x27;s official language in communicating with the Filipino Deaf.

While Filipino is used for communication across the country&#x27;s diverse linguistic groups and in popular culture, the government operates mostly using English. Including second-language speakers, there are more speakers of Filipino than English in the Philippines. The other regional languages are given official auxiliary status in their respective places according to the constitution but particular languages are not specified. Some of these regional languages are also used in education.

The indigenous scripts of the Philippines (such as the Kulitan, Tagbanwa and others) are used very little; instead, Philippine languages are today written in the Latin script because of the Spanish and American colonial experience. Baybayin, though generally not understood, is one of the most well-known of the Philippine indigenous scripts and is used mainly in artistic applications such as on current Philippine banknotes, where the word &quot;Pilipino&quot; is inscribed using the writing system. Additionally, the Arabic script is used in the Muslim areas in the southern Philippines.

Tagalog and Cebuano are the most commonly spoken native languages. Filipino and English are the official languages of the Philippines. The official languages were used as the main modes of instruction in schools, allowing mother tongues as auxiliary languages of instruction. The Philippine Department of Education (DepEd) has put forth initiatives in using mother tongues as modes of instructions over the years.

== National and official languages ==
===History===
Spanish was the official language of the country for more than three centuries under Spanish colonial rule, and became the lingua franca of the Philippines in the 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced universal education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. It was also the language of the Philippine Revolution, and the 1899 Malolos Constitution effectively proclaimed it as the official language of the First Philippine Republic. National hero José Rizal wrote most of his works in Spanish. Following the American occupation of the Philippines and the imposition of English, the use of Spanish declined gradually. Spanish then declined rapidly because of the Japanese occupation in the 1940s.

Under the U.S. occupation and civil regime, English began to be taught in schools. By 1901, public education used English as the medium of instruction. Around 600 educators (called &quot;Thomasites&quot;) who arrived in that year aboard the USAT &quot;Thomas&quot; replaced the soldiers who also functioned as teachers. The 1935 Constitution added English as an official language alongside Spanish. A provision in this constitution also called for Congress to &quot;take steps toward the development and adoption of a common national language based on one of the existing native languages.&quot; On November 12, 1937, the First National Assembly created the National Language Institute. President Manuel L. Quezón appointed native Waray speaker Jaime C. De Veyra to chair a committee of speakers of other regional languages. Their aim was to select a national language among the other regional languages. Ultimately, Tagalog was chosen as the base language on December 30, 1937, on the basis that it was the most widely spoken and developed local language. Quezon himself was born and raised in Baler, Aurora, which is a native Tagalog-speaking area.

In 1939, President Manuel L. Quezón renamed the Tagalog language as &quot;Wikang Pambansa&quot; (&quot;national language&quot; in English translation). The language was further renamed in 1959 as &quot;Pilipino&quot; by Secretary of Education José E. Romero. The 1973 constitution declared the Pilipino language to be co-official, along with English, and mandated the development of a national language, to be known as &quot;Filipino&quot;. In addition, Spanish regained its official status when President Ferdinand Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155, s. 1973.

The 1987 Constitution under President Corazon Aquino declared Filipino to be the national language of the country. Filipino and English were named as the country&#x27;s official languages, with the recognition of regional languages as having official auxiliary status in their respective regions (though not specifying any particular languages). Spanish and Arabic were to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. Filipino also had the distinction of being a national language that was to be &quot;developed and enriched on the basis of existing Philippine and other languages.&quot; Although not explicitly stated in the constitution, Filipino is in practice almost completely composed of the Tagalog language as spoken in the capital, Manila; however, organizations such as the University of the Philippines began publishing dictionaries such as the &quot;UP Diksyonaryong Filipino&quot; in which words from various Philippine languages were also included. The present constitution is also the first to give recognition to other regional languages. 

Republic Act No. 7104, approved on August 14, 1991, by President Corazon Aquino, created the Commission on the Filipino Language, reporting directly to the President and tasked to undertake, coordinate and promote research for the development, propagation and preservation of Filipino and other Philippine languages. On May 13, 1992, the commission issued Resolution 92–1, specifying that Filipino is the

In 2013, President Noynoy Aquino&#x27;s government launched the country&#x27;s mother tongue-based multi-lingual education program for students in kindergarten to Grade 3, effectively reviving the usage and proliferation of various indigenous languages in the country. The program also strengthened the Filipino language and English language learning capabilities of students. In 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act 11106, declaring Filipino Sign Language (FSL) as the country&#x27;s official language for the Filipino deaf community.

===Usage===

Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila. Both Filipino and English are used in government, education, print, broadcast media, and business, with third local languages often being used at the same time. Filipino has borrowings from, among other languages, Spanish, English, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, Malay, Chinese, Japanese, and Nahuatl. Filipino is an official language of education, but less important than English as a language of publication (except in some domains, like comic books) and less important for academic-scientific-technological discourse. Filipino is used as a lingua franca in all regions of the Philippines as well as within overseas Filipino communities, and is the dominant language of the armed forces (except perhaps for the small part of the commissioned officer corps from wealthy or upper-middle-class families) and of a large part of the civil service, most of whom are non-Tagalogs.

There are different forms of diglossia that exist in the case of regional languages. Locals may use their mother tongue or the regional lingua franca to communicate amongst themselves, but sometimes switch to foreign languages when addressing outsiders. Another is the prevalence of code-switching to English when speaking in both their first language and Tagalog.

The Constitution of the Philippines provides for the use of the vernacular languages as official auxiliary languages in provinces where Filipino is not the lingua franca. Filipinos by and large are polyglots; in the case where the vernacular language is a regional language, Filipinos would speak in Filipino when speaking in formal situations while the regional languages are spoken in non-formal settings. This is evident in major urban areas outside Metro Manila like Camarines Norte in the Bikol-speaking area, and Davao in the Cebuano-speaking area. , the case of Ilocano and Cebuano are becoming more of bilingualism than diglossia due to the publication of materials written in these languages.
The diglossia is more evident in the case of other languages such as Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Bikol, Waray, Hiligaynon, Sambal, and Maranao, where the written variant of the language is becoming less and less popular to give way to the use of Filipino. Although Philippine laws consider some of these languages as &quot;major languages&quot; there is little, if any, support coming from the government to preserve these languages. This may be bound to change, however, given current policy trends.

There still exists another type of diglossia, which is between the regional languages and the minority languages. Here, we label the regional languages as acrolects while the minority languages as the basilect. In this case, the minority language is spoken only in very intimate circles, like the family or the tribe one belongs to. Outside this circle, one would speak in the prevalent regional language, while maintaining an adequate command of Filipino for formal situations. Unlike the case of the regional languages, these minority languages are always in danger of becoming extinct because of speakers favoring the more prevalent regional language. Moreover, most of the users of these languages are illiterate and as expected, there is a chance that these languages will no longer be revived due to lack of written records.

In addition to Filipino and English, other languages have been proposed as additional nationwide languages. Among the most prominent proposals are Spanish and Japanese.

==Regional languages==

According to Ethnologue, a total of 182 native languages are spoken in the nation and four languages have been classified as extinct: Dicamay Agta, Katabaga, Tayabas Ayta and Villaviciosa Agta. Except for Arabic, English, Spanish, Chavacano and varieties of Chinese (Hokkien, Cantonese and Mandarin), all of the languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian language family.

The following are the four Philippine languages with more than five million native speakers:

* Tagalog
* Cebuano
* Ilocano
* Hiligaynon

In addition, there are seven with between one and five million native speakers:
* Bicolano
* Waray
* Kapampangan
* Pangasinan
* Maguindanao
* Maranao
* Tausug

One or more of these is spoken natively by more than 90% of the population.

A Philippine language sub-family identified by Robert Blust includes languages of north Sulawesi and the Yami language of Taiwan, but excludes the Sama–Bajaw languages of the Tawi-Tawi islands, as well as a couple of North Bornean languages spoken in southern Palawan.

Eskayan is an artificial auxiliary language created as the embodiment of a Bohol nation in the aftermath of the Philippine–American War. It is used by about 500 people.

A theory that the Brahmic scripts of Sumatra, Sulawesi and the Philippines are descended from an early form of the Gujarati script was presented at the 2010 meeting of the Berkeley Linguistics Society.

===Mutual intelligibility===
Philippine languages are often referred to by Filipinos as dialects, partly as a relic of the inaccurate vocabulary used in literature during the American period (1898–1946). While there are indeed many hundreds of dialects in the Philippines, they represent variations of no fewer than 120 distinct languages, and many of these languages maintain greater differences than those between established European languages like French and Spanish.

The vast differences between the languages can be seen in the following translations of what has been asserted to be the Philippine national proverb:

====Dialectal variation====
The amount of dialectal variation varies from language to language. Languages like Tagalog, Kapampangan and Pangasinan are known to have very moderate dialectal variation.

For the languages of the Bicol Region, however, there is great dialectal variation. There are cities and towns which have their own dialects and varieties. Below is the sentence &quot;Were you there at the market for a long time?&quot; translated into certain varieties of Bikol. The translation is followed by dialect and corresponding language, and a city/town in Bicol where they are spoken. The final translation is in Tagalog.

* Haloy ka duman sa saod? (Standard Coastal Bikol, a dialect of Central Bikol; Canaman, Camarines Sur)
* Aloy ka duman sa saod? (Magarao, a variety of Coastal Bikol; Magarao, Camarines Sur)
* Naawat ka duman sa saod? (Southern Catanduanes Bikol or &quot;Virac Bikol&quot;, a dialect of Coastal Bikol; Virac, Catanduanes)
* Naəban ikā sadtō sāran? (Rinconada Bikol; Iriga City)
* Nauban ikā sadtō sāran? (Rinconada Bikol; Nabua, Camarines Sur)
* Uban ika adto sa saod? (Libon, Albay Bikol; Libon, Albay)
* Naëǧëy ika adto sa saran? (Buhinon, Albay Bikol; Buhi, Camarines Sur)
* Ëlëy ka idto sa sëd? (West Miraya Bikol, Albay Bikol; Oas, Albay)
* Na-alõy ika idto sa sâran/merkado? (West Miraya Bikol, Albay Bikol; Polangui, Albay)
* Naëlay ka idto sa saran? (East Miraya Bikol, Albay Bikol; Guinobatan, Albay)
* Naulay ka didto sa saran? (East Miraya Bikol, Albay Bikol; Daraga, Albay)
* Dugay ka didto sa merkado? (Ticao, Masbateño; Monreal, Masbate)
* Awat ka didto sa plasa? (Gubat, Southern Sorsogon; Gubat, Sorsogon)
* Awát ka didto sa rilansi? (Bulan, Southern Sorsogon; Bulan, Sorsogon)
* Matagál ka na ba roón sa palengke? (Tagalog)

====Comparison chart====
Below is a chart of Philippine languages. While there have been disagreements on which should be classified as a &quot;language&quot; and which should be classified as a &quot;dialect&quot;, the chart shows that most have similarities, yet are not mutually comprehensible. These languages are arranged according to the regions where they are natively spoken (from north to south, then east to west).

There is a language spoken by the Tao people (also known as Yami) of Orchid Island of Taiwan which is not included in the language of the Philippines. Their language, Tao (or Yami) is part of the Batanic languages which includes Ivatan, Babuyan, and Itbayat of the &quot;Batanes&quot;.

===Native speakers===
Below are the numbers of Filipinos who speak the following 20 languages as their native languages based on the 2020 Census of Population and Housing by the Philippine Statistics Authority. The number of speakers of each language is calculated from the reported number of households by assuming an average household size of 4.1 persons as of 2020.

==== By households ====
Below are the country&#x27;s top ten languages by the number of households in which they are spoken, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. There are a total of 26,388,654 households in the country.

^Boholano, Tausug/Bahasa Sug, Maranao, Karay-a/Kinaray-a, Bukidnon/Binukid-Akeanon/Aklanon, Masbateño/ Masbatenon, Surigaonon, and Zamboagueño-Chavacano

===Negrito languages===
==Language vitality==
===2010 UNESCO designation===
Endangered and extinct languages in the Philippines are based on the 3rd world volume released by UNESCO in 2010.

Degree of endangerment (UNESCO standard)
* &quot;Safe&quot;: language is spoken by all generations; intergenerational transmission is uninterrupted.
* &quot;Vulnerable&quot;: most children speak the language, but it may be restricted to certain domains (e.g., home).
* &quot;Definitely endangered&quot;: children no longer learn the language as mother tongue in the home.
* &quot;Severely endangered&quot;: language is spoken by grandparents and older generations; while the parent generation may understand it, they do not speak it to children or among themselves.
* &quot;Critically endangered&quot;: the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, and they speak the language partially and infrequently.
* &quot;Extinct&quot;: there are no speakers left. These languages are included in the Atlas if presumably extinct since the 1950s.

===2014 North Dakota study===
In a separate study by Thomas N. Headland, the Summer Institute of Linguistics in Dallas, and the University of North Dakota called &quot;Thirty Endangered Languages in the Philippines&quot;, the Philippines has 32 endangered languages, but 2 of the listed languages in the study are written with 0 speakers, noting that they are extinct or probably extinct. All of the listed languages are Negrito languages, the oldest languages in the Philippines.

===Proposals to conserve Philippine languages===

There have been numerous proposals to conserve the many languages of the Philippines. According to the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino, there are 135 ethnolinguistic groups in the country, each having their own distinct Philippine language.

Among the proposals include (1) &quot;establishing a dictionary &amp; sentence construction manual&quot; for each of the 135 living languages in the country, (2) &quot;video documentation&quot; of all Philippine languages, (3) &quot;revival of the ancient scripts of the Philippines&quot; where each ethnic group&#x27;s own script shall be revived and used in schools along with the currently-used Roman script in communities where those script/s used to be known, (4) &quot;teaching of ethnic mother languages first&quot; in homes and schools before the teaching of Filipino and foreign languages (English, Spanish and Arabic), and (5) &quot;using the ethnic mother language and script first in public signs&quot; followed by Filipino and foreign languages (English, Spanish and Arabic) and scripts, for example, using Cebuano first followed by Filipino and English underneath the sign.

Currently, only the fourth proposal has been made by the national government of the Philippines. A National Script bill has been filed in Congress in support of the third and fifth proposal, however, the bill only mandates the usage of the ancient script compatible with the national language, which is Filipino.

==Major immigrant languages==
===Arabic===
Arabic is used by some Filipino Muslims in both a liturgical and instructional capacity since the arrival of Islam and establishment of several Sultanates in the 14th century. Along with Malay, Arabic was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the Malay Archipelago among Muslim traders and the Malay aristocracy.

The 1987 Constitution mandates that Arabic (along with Spanish) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis. Arabic is taught for free and is promoted in some Islamic centres predominantly in the southernmost parts of Philippines. It is used primarily in religious activities and education (such as in a &quot;madrasa&quot; or Islamic school) and rarely for official events or daily conversation. In this respect, its function and use is somewhat like the traditional roles of Latin and Spanish in Filipino Catholicism &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; other currently spoken languages.

Islamic schools in Mindanao teach Modern Standard Arabic in their curriculum.

===English===
The first significant exposure of Filipinos to the English language occurred in 1762 when the British invaded Manila during the Seven Years&#x27; War, but this was a brief episode that had no lasting influence. English later became more important and widespread during American rule between 1898 and 1946, and remains an official language of the Philippines.

On August 22, 2007, three Malolos City regional trial courts in Bulacan decided to use Filipino, instead of English, in order to promote the national language. Twelve stenographers from Branches 6, 80 and 81, as model courts, had undergone training at Marcelo H. del Pilar College of Law of Bulacan State University College of Law following a directive from the Supreme Court of the Philippines. De la Rama said it was the dream of former Chief Justice Reynato Puno to implement the program in other areas such as Laguna, Cavite, Quezón, Nueva Écija, Batangas, Rizal, and Metro Manila.

English is used in official documents of business, government, the legal system, medicine, the sciences and as a medium of instruction. Filipinos prefer textbooks for subjects like calculus, physics, chemistry, biology, etc., written in English rather than Filipino. However, the topics are usually taught, even in colleges, in Tagalog or the local language. By way of contrast, native languages are often heard in colloquial and domestic settings, spoken mostly with family and friends. The use of English attempts to give an air of formality, given its use in school, government and various ceremonies. A percentage of the media such as cable television and newspapers are also in English; major television networks such as ABS-CBN and GMA and all AM radio stations broadcast primarily in Filipino, as well as government-run stations like PTV and the Philippine Broadcasting Service. However, a 2009 article by a UNICEF worker reported that the level of spoken English language in the Philippines was poor. The article reported that aspiring Filipino teachers score the lowest in English out of all of the subjects on their licensing exams.

A large influx of English (American English) words have been assimilated into Tagalog and the other native languages called Taglish or Bislish. There is a debate, however, on whether there is diglossia or bilingualism, between Filipino and English. Filipino is also used both in formal and informal situations. Though the masses would prefer to speak in Filipino, government officials tend to speak in English when performing government functions. There is still resistance to the use of Filipino in courts and the drafting of national statutes.

In parts of Mindanao, English and Tagalog blend with Cebuano to form &quot;Davao Tagalog&quot;.

===Hokkien===
Diplomatic ties with the Ming dynasty among some established states or kingdoms in Luzon and direct interactions and trade overall within the archipelago as a whole may go as far back as the early 10th century during the Song dynasty. Mandarin Chinese is the medium of instruction and subject matter being taught for Chinese class in Chinese schools in the Philippines. However, the Lan-nang-ue variant of Hokkien Chinese is the majority household and heritage language of the Chinese Filipinos who, for generations, mostly trace roots from Southern Fujian province in China. Other varieties of Chinese such as Yue Chinese (especially Taishanese or Cantonese), Teochew, and Hakka are spoken among a minority of Chinese Filipinos whose ancestral roots trace all the way back from the Guangdong or Guangxi provinces of Southern China. Most Chinese Filipinos raised in the Philippines, especially those of families of who have lived in the Philippines for multiple generations, are typically able and usually primarily speak Philippine English, Tagalog or other regional Philippine languages (e.g., Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, etc.), or the code-switching or code-mixing of these such as Taglish or Bislish, but Philippine Hokkien is typically or occasionally used within Chinese Filipino households privately amongst family or acts a heritage language among descendants of such. Hokaglish is the code-switching equivalent of the above languages.

As with Spanish, many native languages have co-opted numerous loanwords from Chinese, in particular words that refer to cuisine, household objects, and Philippine kinship terminology.

===Japanese===
The Japanese first came to the Philippines around the 11th century CE, the first country they emigrated to, as well as in waves from the 15th century (as depicted in the Boxer Codex) 17th century, late 19th century, 1900s, 1930s, and the 1940s. There is a small Japanese community and a school for Japanese in Metro Manila due to the number of Japanese companies. Also there is a large community of Japanese and Japanese descendants in Laguna province, Baguio, and in the Davao Region. Davao City is a home to a large population of Japanese descendants. Japanese laborers were hired by American companies like the National Fiber Company (NAFCO) in the first decades of the 20th century to work in abaca plantations. Japanese were known for their hard work and industry. During World War II to present, Japanese schools are present in Davao City, such as Philippine Nikkei Jin Kai International School (PNJK IS).

===Korean===

Korean is mainly spoken by the expatriates from South Korea and people born in the Philippines with Korean ancestry. The Korean language has been added under the Department of Education (DepEd) Special Program in Foreign Language (SPFL) curriculum, together with Spanish, French, German, Chinese, and Japanese.

===Malay===
Malay is spoken as a second language by a minority of the Tausug, Sama-Bajau, and Yakan peoples in the southernmost parts of the Philippines, from Zamboanga down to Tawi-Tawi. It is also spoken as a daily language by the Indonesians and Malaysians who have settled, or do business in the Philippines. It is also spoken in southern Palawan to some extent. It is not spoken among the Maranao and Maguindanao peoples. Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia and the southern Philippines are largely Islamic and the liturgical language of Islam is Arabic, but the vast majority of Muslims in the Philippines have little practical knowledge of Arabic beyond limited religious terminology.

The Malay language, a Malayo-Polynesian language alongside the Philippine languages, has had an immense influence on many of the languages of the Philippines. This is because Old Malay used to be the lingua franca throughout the archipelago, a good example of this is Magellan&#x27;s translator Enrique using Malay to converse with the native &quot;Sugbuanon&quot; (Cebuano) during this time period.

An example of Old Malay spoken in Philippine history can be seen in the language of the 10th century Laguna Copperplate Inscription.

When the Spanish had first arrived in the Philippines in the 16th century, Old Malay was spoken among the aristocracy.

It is believed that Ferdinand Magellan&#x27;s slave Enrique of Malacca could converse with the local leaders in Cebu Island, confirming to Magellan his arrival in Southeast Asia.

Today, Indonesian is taught as a foreign language in the Department of Linguistics and Asian Languages in the University of the Philippines. Also, the Indonesian School in Davao City teaches the language to preserve the culture of Indonesian immigrants there. The Indonesian Embassy in Manila also offers occasional classes for Filipinos and foreigners.

Since 2013, the Indonesian Embassy in the Philippines has given basic Indonesian language training to members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

In an interview, Department of Education Secretary Armin Luistro said that the country&#x27;s government should promote Indonesian and Malaysian, which are both related to Filipino and other Philippine languages. Thus, the possibility of offering it as an optional subject in public schools is being studied.

===South Asian languages===
Since pre-Spanish times, there have been small Indian communities in the Philippines. Indians tend to be able to speak Tagalog and the other native languages, and are often fluent in English. Among themselves, Sindhi and Punjabi are used. Urdu is spoken among the Pakistani community. Only few South Asians, such as Pakistani, as well as the recent newcomers like speakers of Tamil, Nepali and Marathi retain their own respective languages.

===Spanish===
Spanish was introduced in the islands after 1565, when the Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi set sail from Mexico and founded the first Spanish settlement on Cebú. Though its usage is not as widespread as before, Spanish has had a significant influence in the various local Philippine languages such as providing numerous loan words. Several Spanish-based creole language varieties collectively known as Chabacano have also emerged. The current 1987 constitution makes mention of Spanish in which it provides that Spanish (along with Arabic) is to be promoted on an optional and voluntary basis.

In 1593, the first printing press in the Philippine islands was founded and it released the first (albeit polyglot) book, the &quot;Doctrina Christiana&quot; that same year. In the 17th century, Spanish religious orders founded the first universities in the Philippines, some of which are considered the oldest in Asia. During colonial rule through Mexico, Spanish was the language of education, trade, politics, and religion, and by the 19th century, became the colony&#x27;s lingua franca although it was mainly used by the educated Filipinos. In 1863, a Spanish decree introduced a system of public education, creating free public schooling in Spanish. In the 1890s, the Philippines had a prominent group of Spanish-speaking scholars called the Ilustrados, such as José Rizal. Some of these scholars participated in the Philippine Revolution and later in the struggle against American occupation. Both the Malolos Constitution and the &quot;Lupang Hinirang&quot; (national anthem) were written in Spanish.

Under U.S. rule, the English language began to be promoted instead of Spanish. The use of Spanish began to decline as a result of the introduction of English into the public schools as a language of instruction. The 1935 constitution establishing the Philippine Commonwealth designated both English and Spanish as official languages. The 1950 census stated that Filipinos who spoke Spanish as a first or second language made up only 6% of the population. In 1990, the census reported that the number had dwindled to just 2,500 native speakers. A 2020 estimate indicated that about 400,000 Filipinos (less than 0.5% of the population) have working knowledge of the language.

Spanish briefly lost its status as an official language upon promulgation of the 1973 constitution but regained official status two months later when President Marcos signed Presidential Decree No. 155. In the 1987 constitution, Spanish is designated as an &quot;optional and voluntary language&quot; but does not mention it as an &quot;official language&quot;. Spanish was dropped as a college requirement during Corazón Aquino&#x27;s administration. Former president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a third-language Spanish speaker, introduced legislation to re-establish the instruction of Spanish in 2009 in the state education system. Today, the language is still spoken by Filipino-Spanish mestizos and Spanish families who are mainly concentrated in Metro Manila, Iloilo and Cebu. It remains an optional subject in some academic institutions, such as the University of Santo Tomás in Manila and the University of San Carlos in Cebu.

Up until recently, many historical documents, land titles, and works of literature were written in Spanish and not translated into Filipino languages or English. Spanish, through colonization has contributed the largest number of loanwords and expressions in Tagalog, Cebuano, and other Philippine languages. The &quot;Academia Filipina de la Lengua Española&quot; (Philippine Academy of the Spanish Language), established in 1924, is a founding member of the Association of Academies of the Spanish Language; an association of the various Spanish academies of the world which cooperate in the standardizing and promotion of the Spanish language. Among its past and present academics are former President Arroyo, former Foreign Affairs Secretary Alberto Romulo, and Archbishop of Cebú Cardinal Ricardo Vidal.

====Spanish creoles====
There are several Spanish-based creole languages in the Philippines, collectively called Chavacano. These may be split into two major geographical groups:

* In Luzon:
** &quot;Caviteño&quot; (Chabacano de Cavite), spoken in Cavite City, Cavite.
** &quot;Ternateño&quot; (Chabacano de Bahra), spoken in Ternate, Cavite.
** &quot;Ermitaño&quot; (Chabacano de Ermita), formerly spoken in Ermita, Manila but is now extinct. The last reported speakers were a woman and her grandson during the 1980s and 1990s.
* In Mindanao:
** &quot;Zamboangueño Chavacano&quot; (Chabacano de Zamboanga / Zamboangueño Chavacano), spoken in Zamboanga City, Zamboanga Sibugay, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga del Norte, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi and Semporna, Sabah, Malaysia (360,000 native speakers-Zamboanga City alone as per 2000 census, making it the most spoken form and known form of Chavacano)
** &quot;Cotabateño&quot; (Chabacano de Cotabato), spoken in Cotabato
** &quot;Davaoeño Abakay&quot; (Chabacano de Davao), spoken in Davao City

<text>Kildrummy Castle is a ruined castle near Kildrummy, in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. Though ruined, it is one of the most extensive castles dating from the 13th century to survive in eastern Scotland, and was the seat of the Earls of Mar. It is owned today by Historic Environment Scotland and is open to the public as a scheduled ancient monument with gardens that are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland.

==History==
The castle was probably built in the mid-13th century under Gilbert de Moravia. It has been posited that siting of Kildrummy Castle was influenced by the location of the Grampian Mounth trackway crossings, particularly the Elsick Mounth and Cryne Corse Mounth. Kildrummy Castle underwent siege numerous times in its history, first in defence of the family of Robert the Bruce in August–September 1306 (leading to the executions of Nigel Bruce and many other Scots), and again in 1335 by David of Strathbogie. On this occasion Christina Bruce held off the attackers until her husband Sir Andrew Murray came to her rescue. In the reign of David II, Walter Maule of Panmure was warden of Kildrummy Castle.

In 1403-4 Alexander Stewart, murdered Sir Malcolm Drummond and then took his widow, Isabel Douglas, Countess of Mar, by force and laid claim to Kildrummy and the title of &quot;Earl of Mar&quot;. In 1435 it was taken over by James I and became a royal castle. In 1468 Henry Kinghorn was keeper of Kildrummy Castle for James III and spent £100 Scots on building works and repairs. James IV granted the keeping of Kildrummy and its lands to Alexander Elphinstone, 1st Lord Elphinstone and his wife Elizabeth Barlow in 1507.

The castle passed from the Clan Elphinstone to the Clan Erskine before being abandoned in 1716 following the failure of the Jacobite Rising of 1715.

In 1538 the castle was raided by John Strachan, the young laird of Lenturk, who took furnishings and fixtures. Strachan brought a blacksmith to remove the ironwork from the windows and doors. Some of the metal was turned into horseshoes and used to mend ploughs at the Kirktoun of Glenbuchat.

In May 1585 Margaret Haldane, the wife of David Erskine, Commendator of Dryburgh, was held at Kildrummy in the custody of the Master of Elphinstone. In 1645 Robert Farquharson of Invercauld was the keeper of Kildrummy Castle for the Earl of Mar and his son Lord Erskine. The laird of Glenkindie also helped to keep the castle, fearing the depredations that a garrison of outsider or &quot;stranger&quot; soldiers would make on his lands.

==Architecture==
Kildrummy Castle is &quot;shield-shaped&quot; in plan with a number of independent towers. The flat side of the castle overlooks a steep ravine; moreover, on the opposite side of the castle the walls come to a point, which was once defended by a massive twin-towered gatehouse. The castle also had a keep, called the &quot;Snow Tower&quot;, taller than the other towers, built in the French style, as at Bothwell Castle. Extensive earthworks protected the castle, including a dry moat and the ravine. Most of the castle foundations are now visible, along with most of its lower-storey walls. Archaeological excavations in 1925 uncovered decorative stone flooring and evidence of battles.

==Today==
The castle was given into the care of the Ministry of Works in 1951, and is now owned by its successor organisation, Historic Environment Scotland. The castle and its gardens, in the quarry used to excavate stone for the castle, are both open to the public.

A hotel (the &quot;Kildrummy Castle Hotel&quot;) has been built on the old estate, overlooking the ruins.

Kildrummy Castle was the venue for the Scottish Sculpture Open, sometimes known as the Kildrummy Open, organised by the Scottish Sculpture Workshop from 1981 to 1997.

<text>Tambon (, ) is a local governmental unit in Thailand. Below district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) and province (&quot;changwat&quot;), they form the third administrative subdivision level. there were 7,255 tambons, not including the 180 &quot;khwaeng&quot; of Bangkok, which are set at the same administrative level, thus every district contains eight to ten tambon. &quot;Tambon&quot; is usually translated as &quot;township&quot; or &quot;subdistrict&quot; in English — the latter is the recommended translation, though also often used for &quot;king amphoe&quot;, the designation for a subdistrict acting as a branch (Thai: &quot;king&quot;) of the parent district. Tambon are further subdivided into 74,944 villages (&quot;muban&quot;) as of 2008. &quot;Tambon&quot; within cities or towns are not subdivided into villages, but may have less formal communities called &quot;chumchon&quot; (ชุมชน) that may be formed into community associations. The average area of a subdistrict in Thailand is about , while its average population of a subdistrict in Thailand is about 9,637 people.

==History==
The &quot;tambon&quot; as a subdivision has a long history. It was the second-level subdivision of the area administered by a provincial town in the 19th century. The governor of the province was supposed to appoint a communal elder, &quot;kamnan&quot; or &quot;phan&quot;.

In the administrative reforms started in 1892 under Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, the first Thai Minister of the Interior, the three levels of subdivision of provinces were continued, i.e., starting from district to &quot;tambon&quot; to the lowest level called &quot;muban&quot;.

=== Muban ===

The subdistricts are subdivided into administrative villages (muban, ) as the lowest administrative subdivision. Usually these are referred to much more often by the village number than the actual name, especially as an administrative village may contain more than one settlement, or a large settlement may be split into more than one administrative village. One of the elected village headmen is elected as the subdistrict headman (Kamnan).

=== Subdistrict (Tambon) administrative organization (SAO/TAO)===
With the &quot;Tambon Council and Tambon Administrative Authority Act BE 2537&quot; (1994) and later by the constitution of 1997, &quot;tambon&quot; were decentralized into local government units with an elected tambon council. Depending on its size and tax income a &quot;tambon&quot; may either be administered by a &quot;Subdistrict (Tambon) Administrative Organization&quot; (SAO or TAO, ) or a &quot;Tambon Council&quot; (TC, ). However, since 2001 all of the Tambon Councils have been upgraded to Tambon Administrative Organizations. The TAO council consist of two representatives from each administrative village in the subdistrict, and one directly elected president. The subdistrict area which belongs to a municipality (&quot;thesaban&quot;) is administered by the municipal council. In the event only part of the subdistrict is within a municipality, the remaining part is administered by a TAO. Adjoining subdistricts of a single district can also have a joint TAO.

=== One Tambon One Product ===

In 2001, Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra started a project in which every &quot;tambon&quot; would select a typical, distinctive local product. The project then aids in promoting the product, as well as assisting in modernizing production. Shops selling OTOP products are located in each provincial capital.

<doc id="626828" wikidata="Q542855" url="?curid=626828" title="Salomon Morel">
<text>Salomon Morel (November 15, 1919 – February 14, 2007) was an officer in the Ministry of Public Security in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, and a commander of concentration camps run by the NKVD and communist authorities until 1956.

After Nazi Germany occupied Poland, Morel and his family went into hiding to avoid being placed in one of the Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland. Both Salomon and his brother survived part of the war and Holocaust under the protection of a local Polish farmer, before joining communist partisans.

In 1944 Morel became warden of the Soviet NKVD prison at Lublin Castle. During most of 1945, he was commander of the Zgoda labour camp in Świętochłowice. In 1949 he was made commander of Jaworzno concentration camp and remained a commandant of numerous concentration camps until they were all closed down in 1956 following the Polish October. He then worked as head of prison in Katowice and was promoted to the rank colonel in the political police, the MBP. He was dismissed during the 1968 Polish political crisis which saw the purging of ex-Stalinists.

Beginning in the early 1990s Morel was investigated by Institute of National Remembrance for war crimes and crimes against humanity, including the revenge killings of more than 1,500 prisoners in Upper Silesia, most of whom were either native speakers of Silesian German or Polish political prisoners. In 1996, he was indicted by Poland on charges of torture, war crimes, crimes against humanity and communist crimes. After his case was publicized by the Polish, German, British, and American media, Morel fled to Israel and was granted citizenship under the Law of Return. Poland twice requested his extradition, once in 1998 and once in 2004, but Israel refused to comply and rejected the more serious charges as being false and again rejected extradition on the grounds that the statute of limitations against Morel had run out and that Morel was in poor health. Polish authorities responded by accusing Israel of applying a double standard, and the controversy over Morel&#x27;s extradition continued until his death.

==Background and youth==
Salomon Morel was born on November 15, 1919, in the village of Garbów near Lublin, Poland, the son of a Jewish baker who owned a small bakery. During the Great Depression, the family business began to falter. Therefore, Morel moved to Łódź where he worked as a sales clerk, but returned to Garbów following the outbreak of war in September 1939.

==World War II and early NKVD service==
Morel&#x27;s family went into hiding during World War II to avoid being placed in the ghetto. Morel&#x27;s mother, father and one brother were killed by the Blue Police during Christmas of 1942. Solomon Morel and his brother Izaak survived the Holocaust hidden by Józef Tkaczyk, a Polish Catholic. In 1983, Józef Tkaczyk was designated as one of the Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for saving the Morel brothers.

Morrel&#x27;s two brothers died during the war, one in 1943, another in 1945. According to the IPN, as the Eastern Front advanced, Morel and other communist partisans came out of hiding. In the summer of 1944, Morel joined the Milicja Obywatelska in Lublin. Later, he became a warden at the Lublin Castle, where many soldiers of the anti-communist Armia Krajowa (Home Army) were imprisoned and tortured.

The Israeli mass media and government presented yet a different version of his life. The Israeli letter rejecting extradition states that Morel joined the partisans of the Red Army in 1942, and was in the forests when his parents, sister-in-law, and one brother were allegedly killed by Blue Police. According to a number of media sources, Morel claimed that he was at one point an inmate in Auschwitz and over thirty of his relatives were killed in the Holocaust.

==Commander of Zgoda labour camp==
On March 15, 1945, Morel became commander of the infamous Zgoda camp in Świętochłowice. The Zgoda camp was set up by the Soviet political police, or NKVD, after the Soviet Army entered southern Poland. In February 1945 the camp was handed over to the Polish Ministry of Public Security. Most prisoners in the camp were Silesians and German citizens, while a small number were from &quot;central Poland&quot;, and about 38 foreigners.

Sometimes children were sent to the camp along with parents. Prisoners were not accused of any crime, but were sent by decision of Security Authorities. Authorities tried to convince society that prisoners were only ethnic Germans and former Nazi war criminals and collaborators. Keith Lowe notes that &quot;in reality almost anyone could end up there&quot; and the memorial in front of the camp&#x27;s main gate describes the prisoners as mainly local population. It is estimated that close to 2,000 inmates died in the camp where torture and abuse of prisoners were chronic and rampant and resulted in an average 100 inmate deaths a day. Solomon Morel&#x27;s preferred method of torture was the ice water tank where prisoners would be put in with freezing water up to their necks until they died. The camp was closed in November 1945.

The survivor Dorota Boriczek described Morel as &quot;a barbaric and cruel man&quot; who often personally tortured and killed prisoners. Gerhard Gruschka, a local Upper Silesian of Polish descent, was imprisoned in Zgoda when he was 14 years old and wrote a book about his experiences, detailing the endemic torture and abuse in the camp. Morel was also accused of an extensive pattern of sadistic torture in John Sack&#x27;s book &quot;An Eye for an Eye: The Untold Story of Jewish Revenge Against Germans in 1945&quot;, which contributed to publicizing his case in the Anglophone world in the 1990s.

Historians Nicholas A. Robins and Adam Jones note that Morel &quot;presided over a murderous regime founded on ubiquitous assaults and atrocities against German captives.&quot; Keith Lowe notes that &quot;when millions of bruised and destitute refugees began flooding into Germany in the autumn of 1945, they brought with them some disturbing stories of places they called &#x27;hell camps&#x27;, &#x27;death camps&#x27; and &#x27;extermination camps&#x27;&quot;. Zgoda camp was among the most notorious of these camps, and is discussed in detail by Lowe. Lowe notes that survivors&#x27; stories of Zgoda and other camps had a profound impact on West German society and that their stories were taken extremely seriously by the German government and the general population as examples of Stalinist brutality.

==Commander of Jaworzno concentration camp==

From February 1949 to November 1951 Morel was commander of Jaworzno concentration camp, a Stalinist-era concentration camp for political prisoners (designated &quot;enemies of the nation&quot;) in Poland. By that time he already had a reputation in Poland as an &quot;exceptional sadist.&quot; During Morel&#x27;s time as the commandant the prisoners were primarily Poles who were arrested for their opposition to Stalinism, and included soldiers of the Polish Home Army and members of other Polish underground resistance organisations such as Freedom and Independence that was active from 1945 to 1952. Prisoners were often tortured and subjected to forced labor. Morel left the camp when it was turned into a camp for adolescent political prisoners.

==Later career==
Morel continued working as commandant of Stalinist-era concentration camps until 1956. When the Polish October weakened the hard-line Stalinist faction in Poland, the Stalinist concentration camps were closed down. After 1956, Morel worked in various prisons in Silesia and was promoted to the rank of colonel in the political police, the MBP. In the 1960s he was head of a prison in Katowice. In 1964 he defended his master&#x27;s degree with a thesis on the economic value of forced labor at Wrocław University&#x27;s Law School. During the 1950s, the Polish communist government awarded him the Cavalry Cross of the Polonia Restituta and the Golden Cross of Merit.

===Dismissal===
Morel was dismissed from his position in May 1968 in the wake of the 1968 Polish political crisis, which saw the purging of both Jewish officials and ex-Stalinists. As Morel was both Jewish and had a background as head of Stalinist-era concentration camps, he became an obvious target for the 1968 campaign. Unlike most other Polish Jews, and although the Polish communist government pressured Jews to emigrate, Morel nevertheless chose to remain in Poland, and lived there as a retiree from the age of 49.

==Criminal prosecution==
In 1990, after the fall of communism, the General Commission for the Investigation of Crimes against the Polish Nation, precursor to the Institute of National Remembrance, started investigating the abuses carried out at the Zgoda camp. Fearing prosecution, Morel emigrated to Israel in 1992.

===Indictment===
In 1996 Salomon Morel was formally indicted of genocide by the Polish public prosecutor&#x27;s office. The indictment was later amended to include war crimes, crimes against humanity and communist crimes. The latter charge was added in 2004 and constitutes a specific crime under Polish criminal law.

===Extradition controversy===
In 1998, Poland requested that Morel be extradited for trial, but Israel refused. A reply sent to the Polish Justice Ministry from the Israeli government said that Israel would not extradite Mr. Morel as the statute of limitations had expired on war crimes.

In April 2004, Poland filed another extradition request against Morel, this time with fresh evidence, upgrading the case to &quot;communist crimes against the population.&quot; The main charge against Salomon Morel was that, as commandant of the Zgoda camp at Świętochłowice, he created for the prisoners in this camp, out of ethnic and political considerations, conditions that jeopardised their lives, including starvation and torture. The charges against Morel were based primarily on the evidence of over 100 witnesses, including 58 former inmates of the Zgoda camp. In July 2005 this request was again formally refused by the Israeli government. The response rejected the more serious charges as being false, potentially part of an antisemitic conspiracy, and again rejected extradition on the grounds that the statute of limitations against Morel had run out, and that Morel was in poor health. Ewa Koj, a prosecutor with the Polish Institute of National Remembrance, criticized the decision. “There should be one measure for judging war criminals, whether they are German, Israeli or of any other nationality,” Koj said. Morel died in Tel Aviv on February 14, 2007, seventeen years after the investigation and prosecution of him started.

===Legacy===

Anne Applebaum describes Morel as
a Holocaust victim, a communist criminal, a man who lost his entire family to the Nazis, a man consumed by a sadistic fury against Germans and Poles – a fury which may or may not have originated from his victimhood, and may or may not have been connected to his communism. He was deeply vengeful, and profoundly violent. He was awarded medals by the communist Polish state, was prosecuted by the post-communist Polish state, and was defended by the Israeli state, though he had expressed no interest in moving to Israel until half a century after the war, and even then only after he started to fear prosecution.

<text>William Rutter Dawes (19 March 1799 – 15 February 1868) was an English astronomer.

==Biography==
Dawes was born at Christ&#x27;s Hospital then in the City of London (it moved to Horsham, West Sussex in 1902), the son of William Dawes, also an astronomer, and Judith Rutter. He qualified as a doctor in 1825. On 29 October 1828 he was ordained pastor at an Independent chapel in Burscough Street, Ormskirk, Lancashire, formerly part of a silk factory. A new chapel, in Chapel Street, was opened in 1834. Dawes resigned as pastor in December 1837 due to ill health. When, in 1843, the chapel got into financial difficulties due to the debt owing after its construction, Dawes came to their aid.

==Astronomy==
Dawes made extensive measurements of double stars as well as observations of planets. He was a friend of William Lassell. He was nicknamed &quot;eagle eyed&quot;. He set up his private observatory at his home, Hopefield House, built 1856-7 in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. One of his telescopes, an eight-inch (200mm) aperture refractor by Cooke, survives at the Cambridge Observatory, now part of the Institute of Astronomy where it is known as the Thorrowgood Telescope.
He made extensive drawings of Mars during its 1864 opposition. In 1867, Richard Anthony Proctor made a map of Mars based on these drawings. Proctor named two features after Dawes.

He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1830 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1865, for his astronomical work. Proposers for his Royal Society Fellowship included G B Airy and J F W Herschel.

==Awards==

He won the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1855.

==Legacy==

Dawes craters on the Moon and Dawes crater on Mars are named after him, as is a gap within Saturn&#x27;s C Ring, formerly labelled 1.495 RS.

An optical phenomenon, the Dawes limit, is named after him.

==Family==

Dawes married twice. His first wife was Mary Scott née Egerton (1764-1840). They married on 13 January 1824 at Haddenham, Buckinghamshire. She was the widow of his tutor, Thomas Scott. On 28 July 1842 Dawes married Ann Welsby née Coupland (1805-1860). She was the widow of Ormskirk solicitor John Welsby (1800-1839) whom she had married on 16 January 1824.
