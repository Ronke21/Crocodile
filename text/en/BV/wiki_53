<text>Margaret St. Clair (17 February 1911 – 22 November 1995) was an American fantasy and science fiction writer, who also wrote under the pseudonyms Idris Seabright and Wilton Hazzard.

==Biography==

St. Clair was born as Eva Margaret Neeley in Hutchinson, Kansas. Her father, US Representative George A. Neeley, died when Margaret was seven, but left her mother well provided for. With no siblings, Margaret recalled her childhood as &quot;rather a lonely and bookish one.&quot; When she was seventeen, she and her mother moved to California. In 1932, after graduating from the University of California, Berkeley, she married writer Eric St. Clair. In 1934 she earned a Master of Arts in Greek Classics. The St. Clairs lived in a hilltop house with a panoramic view in what is now El Sobrante, California, where Margaret gardened; she also bred and sold dachshund puppies.

In her rare autobiographical writings, St. Clair revealed few details of her personal life, but interviews with some who knew her indicate that she and her husband were well-traveled (including some visits to nudist colonies), were childless by choice, and in 1966 were initiated into Wicca by Raymond Buckland, taking the craft names Froniga and Weyland. Eric St. Clair worked variously as a statistician, social worker, horticulturist, shopfitter, and a laboratory assistant in the University of California at Berkeley Physics Department; he also published numerous short stories and magazine articles and was &quot;perhaps the leading American writer of children&#x27;s stories about bears, having sold close to 100 of them.&quot;

The St. Clairs eventually moved from El Sobrante to a house on the coast near Point Arena, &quot;where every window had an ocean view.&quot; Margaret survived her husband by several years. A lifelong supporter of the American Friends Service Committee, she spent her final years at Friends House in Santa Rosa, California. She died in 1995.

==Short stories==

St. Clair wrote that she &quot;first tried [her] hand at detective and mystery stories, and even the so-called &#x27;quality&#x27; stories&quot;, before finding her niche writing fantasy and science fiction for pulp magazines. &quot;Unlike most pulp writers, I have no special ambitions to make the pages of the slick magazines. I feel that the pulps at their best touch a genuine folk tradition and have a balladic quality which the slicks lack.&quot;

Beginning in the late 1940s, St. Clair wrote and published, by her own count, some 130 short stories. Her early output included the Oona and Jick series of eight stories published from 1947 to 1949, chronicling the comic misadventures of &quot;housewife of the future&quot; Oona and her devoted husband Jick. The stories were ostensibly set in an idealized future but cast a satirical look at post-war domestic life, with its focus on acquiring labor-saving household devices and &quot;keeping up with the Joneses.&quot; St. Clair would later remark that the Oona and Jick stories &quot;were not especially popular with fans, who were—then as now—a rather humorless bunch. The light tone of the stories seemed to offend readers and make them think I was making fun of them.&quot;

She was especially prolific in the 1950s, producing such acclaimed and much-reprinted stories as &quot;The Man Who Sold Rope to the Gnoles&quot; (1951), &quot;Brightness Falls from the Air&quot; (1951), &quot;An Egg a Month from All Over&quot; (1952), and &quot;Horrer Howce&quot; (1956). She occasionally drew inspiration from her education in Classics and her knowledge of Greek myth, as in &quot;Mrs. Hawk&quot; (1950), a modern update of the Circe myth, &quot;The Bird&quot; (1951), about a modern man&#x27;s fateful encounter with the mythical phoenix, and &quot;The Goddess on the Street Corner&quot; (1953), in which a down-on-his-luck wino meets an equally vulnerable Aphrodite.

Beginning in 1950 with &quot;The Listening Child,&quot; all of St. Clair&#x27;s stories in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot; appeared under the pseudonym Idris Seabright. The Seabright story &quot;Personal Monster&quot; appeared in the September 1955 issue immediately before the story &quot;Too Many Bears&quot; by a newcomer to the magazine, St. Clair&#x27;s husband, Eric; in his introductory note to &quot;Too Many Bears&quot;, editor Anthony Boucher quipped that Eric St. Clair &quot;is enviably married to two of my favorite science fiction writers.&quot;

Three of her short stories were adapted for television. &quot;Mrs. Hawk&quot; was filmed as &quot;The Remarkable Mrs. Hawk&quot; for the 1961 season of &quot;Thriller&quot;, with Jo Van Fleet in the title role. &quot;The Boy Who Predicted Earthquakes&quot; (1950) and &quot;Brenda&quot; (1954) were filmed as segments of the 1971 season of Rod Serling&#x27;s &quot;Night Gallery&quot;.

St. Clair wrote only a handful of stories in the mystery genre, but one of them, &quot;The Perfectionist&quot; (1946), was widely reprinted and translated, and served as the basis for the play &quot;A Dash of Bitters&quot; by Reginald Denham and Conrad Sutton Smith. She also wrote several pieces of fiction and satire for &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s magazines&quot; including &quot;Gent&quot; and &quot;The Dude&quot;.

==Novels==

St. Clair also wrote eight novels, four of which were published in the Ace Double series.

&quot;Sign of the Labrys&quot; (1963), set in a vast underground shelter after the world has been depopulated by plagues, featured an overt early use of Wicca elements in fiction; St. Clair wrote that the book &quot;was primarily inspired by Gerald Gardner&#x27;s books on witchcraft.&quot; The editor of &quot;The Crystal Well&quot; called &quot;Sign of the Labrys&quot; &quot;an occult classic,&quot; and in his review of the novel for &quot;Analog&quot;, P. Schuyler Miller declared that St. Clair was one of the most unappreciated writers in science fiction. St. Clair&#x27;s research into witchcraft led to her friendship with Raymond Buckland, who recalled the St. Clairs as &quot;absolutely wonderful people, very warm and loving.&quot;

St. Clair&#x27;s last three novels comprise a loose trilogy, all having in common a near-future setting along the coast of Northern California, and elements of Wicca. In &quot;The Dolphins of Altair&quot; (1967), dolphins and three human compatriots stage a war on mankind by creating earthquakes and polar melting. In &quot;The Shadow People&quot; (1969), a young male narrator in Berkeley descends into a mysterious underworld to rescue his abducted girlfriend. &quot;The Dancers of Noyo&quot; (1973) draws on Pomo lore as a young male narrator in a California largely depopulated by plague goes on a &quot;Grail Journey&quot; along Highway 101. In these last two novels, the narrator&#x27;s quest climaxes in an experience of transcendent enlightenment.

==Legacy==

From the outset of her career, St. Clair was aware of her role as a woman writing in a male-dominated field. An article she wrote for &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot; in 1947, about selling stories to the science fiction market, begins: &quot;Why is science fiction fun to write? At first blush, it doesn&#x27;t seem attractive, particularly for a woman.&quot; When the World Science Fiction Convention was held in Oakland in 1954, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; highlighted St. Clair as a local author by asking her to provide a &quot;menu of the future.&quot; The back cover of her 1963 paperback novel &quot;Sign of the Labrys&quot; declared in large capital letters, &quot;Women Are Writing Science-Fiction!&quot; and continued: &quot;Women are closer to the primitive than men. They are conscious of the moon-pulls, the earth-tides. They possess a buried memory of humankind&#x27;s obscure and ancient past which can emerge to uniquely color and flavor a novel. Such a woman is Margaret St. Clair….&quot;

St. Clair&#x27;s pioneering role as a woman writing science fiction was noted by Eric Leif Davin in his book &quot;Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965&quot;.

The Margaret St. Clair Papers are archived at the University of California, Riverside.

Ramsey Campbell has described St. Clair&#x27;s work as &quot;startlingly original&quot; and argues it has &quot;yet to be fully appreciated&quot;.

<doc id="621357" wikidata="Q1131442" url="?curid=621357" title="Massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan">
<text>TheMassacre in the Great Temple, also called the Alvarado Massacre, was an event on 22 May 1520, in the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, in which the celebration of the Feast of Toxcatl ended in a massacre of Aztec elites.
While Hernán Cortés was in Tenochtitlan, he heard about other Spaniards arriving on the coast – Pánfilo de Narváez had come from Cuba with orders to arrest him – and Cortés was forced to leave the city to fight them. During his absence, Moctezuma asked deputy governor Pedro de Alvarado for permission to celebrate Toxcatl (an Aztec festivity in honor of Tezcatlipoca, one of their main gods.) After the festivities had started, Alvarado interrupted the celebration, killing all the warriors and noblemen who were celebrating inside the Great Temple.

The Spanish version of the incident contains several differing possible motives, while the Aztec version says the Spaniards were enticed into action by the gold the Aztecs were wearing, prompting an Aztec rebellion against the orders of Moctezuma. While differing so on Alvarado&#x27;s specific motive, all accounts agree that the Aztecs were mostly unarmed and that the massacre occurred without warning or direct provocation.

The Aztecs were already antagonistic towards the Spaniards for being inside their city and for holding Moctezuma under house arrest. When Cortés and his men, including those who had come under Narváez, returned, the Aztecs began full-scale hostilities against the Spaniards. The Spaniards had no choice but to retreat from the city, which they did on what is called the Sad Night (La Noche Triste), losing most of their men, who were either killed in the battle or were captured and sacrificed.

==An Aztec account of the incident==
This is part of the Aztec account:

:Here it is told how the Spaniards killed, they murdered the Aztecs who were celebrating the Fiesta of Huitzilopochtli in the place they called The Patio of the Gods

:At this time, when everyone was enjoying the celebration, when everyone was already dancing, when everyone was already singing, when song was linked to song and the songs roared like waves, in that precise moment the Spaniards determined to kill people. They came into the patio, armed for battle.

:They came to close the exits, the steps, the entrances [to the patio]: The Gate of the Eagle in the smallest palace, The Gate of the Canestalk and the Gate of the Snake of Mirrors. And when they had closed them, no one could get out anywhere.

:Once they had done this, they entered the Sacred Patio to kill people. They came on foot, carrying swords and wooden and metal shields. Immediately, they surrounded those who danced, then rushed to the place where the drums were played. They attacked the man who was drumming and cut off both his arms. Then they cut off his head [with such a force] that it flew off, falling far away. 

:At that moment, they then attacked all the people, stabbing them, spearing them, wounding them with their swords. They struck some from behind, who fell instantly to the ground with their entrails hanging out [of their bodies]. They cut off the heads of some and smashed the heads of others into little pieces.

:They struck others in the shoulders and tore their arms from their bodies. They struck some in the thighs and some in the calves. They slashed others in the abdomen and their entrails fell to the earth. There were some who even ran in vain, but their bowels spilled as they ran; they seemed to get their feet entangled with their own entrails. Eager to flee, they found nowhere to go.

:Some tried to escape, but the Spaniards murdered them at the gates while they laughed. Others climbed the walls, but they could not save themselves. Others entered the communal house, where they were safe for a while. Others lay down among the victims and pretended to be dead. But if they stood up again they [the Spaniards] would see them and kill them.

:The blood of the warriors ran like water as they ran, forming pools, which widened, as the smell of blood and entrails fouled the air.

:And the Spaniards walked everywhere, searching the communal houses to kill those who were hiding. They ran everywhere, they searched every place.

:When [people] outside [the Sacred Patio learned of the massacre], shouting began, &quot;Captains, Mexicas, come here quickly! Come here with all arms, spears, and shields! Our captains have been murdered! Our warriors have been slain! Oh Mexica captains, [our warriors] have been annihilated!&quot;

:Then a roar was heard, screams, people wailed, as they beat their palms against their lips. Quickly the captains assembled, as if planned in advance, and carried their spears and shields. Then the battle began. [The Mexicas] attacked them with arrows and even javelins, including small javelins used for hunting birds. They furiously hurled their javelins [at the Spaniards]. It was as if a layer of yellow canes spread over the Spaniards. – &quot;Visión de los Vencidos&quot;

==The Spaniards&#x27; account of the incident==

Spanish Historian Francisco López de Gómara&#x27;s account:

:Cortes wanted to entirely understand the cause of the Indians&#x27; rebellion. He interrogated them [the Spaniards] altogether. Some said it was caused by the message sent by Narváez, others because the people wanted to toss the Spaniards out of the Aztec city [Tenochtitlan], which had been planned as soon as the ships had arrived, because while they were fighting they shouted &quot;Get out!&quot; at them. Others said it was to liberate Moctezuma, for they fought saying, &quot;Free our god and King if you don&#x27;t want to die!&quot; Still others said it was to steal the gold, silver, and jewels that the Spaniards had, because they heard the Indians say, &quot;Here you shall leave the gold that you have taken!&quot; Again, some said it was to keep the Tlaxcalans and other mortal enemies out of the Aztec lands. Finally, many believed that taking their idols as gods, they had given themselves to the devil.

:Any of these things would have been enough to cause the rebellion, not to mention all of them together. But the principal one was that a few days after Cortes left to confront Narváez, it became time for a festival the Mexicas wanted to celebrate in their traditional way. . . . They begged Pedro de Alvarado to give them his permission, so [the Spaniards] wouldn&#x27;t think that they planned to kill them. Alvarado consented provided that there were no sacrifices, no people killed, and no one had weapons.

:More than 600 gentlemen and several lords gathered in the yard of the largest temple; some said there were more than a thousand there. They made a lot of noise with their drums, shells, bugles, and hendidos, which sounded like a loud whistle. Preparing their festival, they were naked, but covered with precious stones, pearls, necklaces, belts, bracelets, many jewels of gold, silver, and mother-of-pearl, wearing very rich feathers on their heads. They performed a dance called the mazeualiztli, which is called that because it is a holiday from work [symbolized by the word for farmer, macehaulli]. . . . They laid mats in the patio of the temple and played drums on them. They danced in circles, holding hands, to the music of the singers, to which they responded.

:The songs were sacred, and not profane, and were sung to praise the god honored in the festival, to induce him to provide water and grain, health, and victory, or to thank him for healthy children and other things. And those who knew the language and these ceremonial rites said that when the people danced in the temples, they perform very different from those who danced the netoteliztli, in voice, movement of the body, head, arms, and feet, by which they manifested their concepts of good and evil. The Spaniards called this dance, an areito, a word they brought from the islands of Cuba and Santo Domingo.

:While the Mexica gentlemen were dancing in the temple yard of Vitcilopuchtli [Huitzilopochtli], Pedro de Alvarado went there. Whether on [the basis of] his own opinion or in an agreement decided by everyone, I don&#x27;t know, but some say he had been warned that the Indian nobles of the city had assembled to plot the mutiny and the rebellion, which they later carried out; others, believe that [the Spaniards] went to watch them perform this famous and praised dance, and seeing how rich they were and wanting the gold the Indians were wearing, he [Alvarado] covered each of the entrances with ten or twelve Spaniards and went inside with more than fifty [Spaniards], and without remorse and lacking any Christian piety, they brutally stabbed and killed the Indians, and took what they were wearing.

==Aftermath==
Cortes returned to the city in late June, by which time the Aztecs had elected Cuitláhuac as &quot;Tlatoani&quot;, supplanting the still-captive Moctezuma. Cortes ordered Moctezuma to try and quell the Aztec rebellion so that the Spaniards might safely depart the city. The strategy backfired badly, and in the ensuing mayhem Moctezuma was killed and Cortes instead resorted to an attempt to stealthily depart under cover of darkness and a rainstorm, but they were detected and what followed became known as La Noche Triste or &quot;The Night of Sorrows&quot; in which many conquistadors and their Tlaxcaltec allies were killed.

<text>Timothy Leslie &quot;Tommy&quot; Boyd (born 14 December 1952) is a British television and radio presenter. He gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s as host of the children&#x27;s television programmes &quot;Magpie&quot;, &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot;, and &quot;The Saturday Show&quot;. Between 1995 and 2002, he was best known for his radio shows on Talksport, where he adopted a more outspoken and controversial style.

==Early life==
Boyd was raised in West London. When he was seven, his younger sister Sally died after a two-year illness from a neurological condition, which affected his parents greatly. Boyd was a Redcoat entertainer at the Butlins resort in Bognor Regis as a teenager, where he saw comedians Tommy Cooper, Ken Dodd, and Bob Monkhouse perform. The three had a particular influence on Boyd, &quot;I drank it all in, seeing what they did and how they did it&quot;. It was there where Tommy Trinder, the resident comedian at the resort, suggested Boyd change his first name. He recalled: &quot;On my birth certificate, it still says Timmy, but he told me, &#x27;You&#x27;ve got to be really funny if you&#x27;re a Tim. Tims are nice guys, but you&#x27;re a cheeky chappie like me. You&#x27;re a Tommy.&#x27; So I changed one vowel.&quot;

==Career==
===Television===
Boyd expressed a desire to work in television from watching John Noakes present the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; on the BBC. In 1977, he secured an audition as the replacement co-presenter of the children&#x27;s magazine show &quot;Magpie&quot; on ITV, replacing Douglas Rae. He botched a pancake making routine on purpose that resembled Noakes&#x27; style which gained a round of applause from the camera crew, and landed the job. The show was scrapped due to high production costs in 1980, after which Boyd presented the news quiz &quot;What&#x27;s Happening?&quot;, in 1981. He presented &quot;Wide Awake Club&quot; on Saturday mornings from 1986 to 1990, and its Sunday spin-off &quot;WAC Extra&quot;, throughout the 1980s. In 1982, he joined the cast of &quot;Jigsaw&quot;, including Janet Ellis, Sylvester McCoy and David Rappaport. Boyd also hosted the BBC programme &quot;Puzzle Trail&quot;.

Between 1982 and 1985, Boyd fronted Central Television&#x27;s Saturday morning kids TV show &quot;The Saturday Show&quot; (later &quot;The Saturday Starship&quot;) alongside Isla St Clair who was later replaced by Bonnie Langford. He was the host of CITV between 1991 and 1993. In 1993 and 1994, Boyd worked on The Children&#x27;s Channel, a satellite television channel. In 1997, Boyd presented &quot;MLB on Five&quot;.

===Radio===
====1970s–1980s====
During the late 1970s, he hosted the Saturday morning radio show &quot;Jellybone&quot;, aimed at children, on LBC radio in London. The show featured items such as a phone-in news quiz, and a segment where group or club members – such as bus spotters – were invited into the studio to discuss their hobby, and to take part in the Jellybone Jury, reviewing and scoring the latest record releases. He later hosted the weekend &quot;Nightline&quot; phone-in programme, replacing Jeremy Beadle as host on Sunday nights in June 1980. The programme is remembered for its mystery guest segment, where a famous person would come in and put on a fake voice and listeners would call in and guess who it was – Roy Castle once featured and &quot;talked&quot; only by playing his trombone. For his &quot;Nightline&quot; show Boyd was awarded the Royal Variety Club Radio Personality of the Year. He returned to children&#x27;s radio on LBC with a Sunday afternoon programme called &quot;Lazily Stacey&quot;, named after a fictional detective he had invented. He later co-presented the breakfast show with Anne Diamond, before finally leaving the station in 1999.

During the late 1980s, Boyd was a radio presenter on the ILR station Southern Sound on the late Sunday evening show along with Nicky Keig-Shevlin and David Legg. The format of the show was phone-in/quiz style with occasional music. Boyd signed off each show by playing &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot; by Louis Armstrong.

On BBC Radio 5 Live he presented the weekday afternoon show between 14:00 and 17:00, which consisted of sport and music.

====1995–2002: Talksport====
In February 1995, Boyd was amongst the inaugural line-up of presenters of the AM station Talksport (initially Talk Radio UK) until November 1998, when he lost his job in a reshuffle after it was taken over by a consortium led by former &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper editor Kelvin MacKenzie. It was during this tenure that Boyd gained a reputation for being controversial and engaging in heated debates. Less argumentative strands of the show would also see the emergence of &quot;The Angry Hour&quot; and &quot;The Wonderful Hour&quot;. After covering for absent presenters on several occasions, Boyd took up a permanent position in April 2000. Boyd also hosted a weekly professional wrestling show on Talksport called &quot;Talk Wrestling&quot;. In February 2002, he helped organise &quot;Revival&quot;, a wrestling event at Crystal Palace Arena that featured former WWE superstars Eddie Guerrero and Brian Christopher.

In May 2000, Boyd began to take calls straight to air and unscreened on Sunday nights which became known as &quot;The Human Zoo&quot; with co-presenter Asher Gould. Boyd was sacked in March 2002 after failing to use the profanity delay to &quot;dump&quot; one caller&#x27;s remarks that contained the word &quot;fucking&quot; and that the British Royal Family should be shot. The segment aired hours after the death of the Queen Mother.

====2004–present====
In 2004 Boyd joined BBC Southern Counties Radio, presenting a Saturday night show with co-host Allison Ferns, where he revived &quot;The Human Zoo&quot; and other more controversial aspects of his previous Talksport show. Boyd moved to the weekday afternoon slot in 2006, again reviving popular elements from the past such as &quot;The Angry Hour&quot;, &quot;The Irritable Hour&quot;, and &quot;The Wonderful Hour&quot;. In August 2007, Boyd co-presented a Sunday night show on Play Radio UK, an Internet radio station. In January 2008, he moved to Original 106 FM, hosting the weekday breakfast show until September, before he returned to Play Radio UK with a general talk and phone-in weekday nights, billed as &quot;Global News Talk&quot;.

In 2009, he launched Digital Sport Radio, which makes radio for major sporting clubs and brands. On 19 May 2017, Boyd presented a one-off show on TalkRadio. Over the following weeks he went on to fill various other time slots on the station in lieu of the usual presenters.

On 5 February 2023, Boyd returned to radio with a Sunday night show on Brighton&#x27;s Regency Radio from 10:00 PM until 1:00 AM. He is joined by former Southern Sound presenters Nicky Keig-Shevlin and David Legge.

<doc id="621366" wikidata="Q551261" url="?curid=621366" title="Matthew Stevens">
<text>Matthew Stevens (born 11 September 1977) is a Welsh professional snooker player. He has won two of the game&#x27;s Triple Crown events, the Masters in 2000 and the UK Championship in 2003. He has also been a two-time runner-up in the other triple crown event, the World Snooker Championship, in 2000 and 2005. Stevens reached a career high ranking of No. 4 for the 2005/2006 season. Stevens has compiled more than 350 century breaks during his career.

==Career==
===Early career===
Stevens became a professional snooker player in 1994; in his second season, he won the Benson &amp; Hedges Championship to qualify for the Masters, where he beat Terry Griffiths 5–3 but lost 5–6 to Alan McManus. He also showed potential the following season by beating Stephen Hendry 5–1 in the Grand Prix. In the 1997–98 season, he reached the semi-finals of both the Grand Prix and the UK Championship, achieving the highest break of the tournament at the latter. He also reached the quarter-finals on his debut at the Crucible in the World Championship, beating Alain Robidoux and Mark King before losing to Ken Doherty. In 1998, he reached his first ranking final at the UK Championship, losing 6–10 to John Higgins.

===2000–2005===
In the 1999–00 season Stevens got to all three finals of the Triple Crown events. In the final of the 1999 UK Championship he lost to Mark Williams 8–10. He won the 2000 Masters title, with a 10–8 win over Ken Doherty in the final. At the 2000 World Championship, he reached the first of his two world championship finals to date. After victories over Tony Drago, Alan McManus, Jimmy White, and Joe Swail, he faced Mark Williams in the final, losing 16–18, after having led 10–6, 13–7, and then 14–10, with the final session to play. Stevens became only the second player in the history of the world championship to lose in the final from holding a four frame overnight lead. He has also been beaten in a world championship semi-final on four occasions: in 2001, 2002, 2004, and 2012. In 2002, he looked certain to have won a place in the final, leading Peter Ebdon 16–14 in their semi-final tie, and just needing a relatively simple red in the 31st frame to leave his opponent requiring snookers. When Stevens missed the pot, Ebdon made an impressive clearance to win the frame and went on to take the next two frames to win the match 17–16.

Stevens won the 2003 UK Championship, after beating Stephen Hendry in the final. He trailed Hendry 0–4 at the first interval, but remarkably he reeled off the next five frames; Hendry found his form again to lead 7–5, but Stevens was not to be denied and clinched a 10–8 victory. This remains the only ranking tournament victory of his career. However, he followed this achievement with a run of nine successive first round defeats in best-of-nine matches, only interrupted by a run to the semi-final of the 2004 World Championship.

He was again runner-up at the 2005 World Championship, losing 16–18 to Shaun Murphy in the final, having been up 10–6, and then 12–11 with only the final session to play. He again relinquished a four frame overnight lead to lose in the final, only the third time this had ever happened in world championship history. The turning point was arguably the 22nd frame, in which he had a shot at the final blue to leave Murphy needing snookers; Stevens elected to play the shot left-handed rather than use the rest and, when he missed the shot, Murphy then cleared the table to level the match at 11–11. Despite the disappointment of losing the final, Stevens insisted that Murphy had simply been the &quot;better player&quot; and that he would himself eventually win the championship.

The following year, Stevens was beaten by Ken Doherty 8–13 in the second round of the 2006 World Championship, having gone into the final session level at 8–8.

===2006–2010===
In 2007, Stevens lost 12–13 to Shaun Murphy in the quarter-finals of the World Championship, having led 11–5 and 12–7 earlier in the match, making him the first person to ever lose a best-of-25 match from a 12–7 lead. The defeat left him ranked outside the top 16 for the first time in eight years. In 2008, he was defeated in the first round of the World Championship for the first time in his career, by defending champion John Higgins, and he finished ranked outside the top 16 for the second consecutive season. The only highlight of the 2008–09 season was a run to the final of the Bahrain Championship, in which he was given a top 16 seeding due to the unavailability of three leading players. He only reached the last 16 of one other event, and failed to qualify for the World Championship after a defeat to Martin Gould. He finished the season with a drop of nine places to world number 26.

Stevens enjoyed a solid 2009–10 season. He qualified for the Welsh Open by beating Barry Pinches 5–4. In the first round, he caused an upset by defeating Shaun Murphy 5–4. He then faced Northern Ireland&#x27;s Mark Allen in the second round but, despite making two century breaks, he lost the match 2–5. He also lost a close match 9–10 to Marcus Campbell in the 2010 World Championship qualifiers, and thus did not make it to the main draw at The Crucible for the second year in succession.

===2010/2011===
Stevens made a promising start to the 2010–11 season by qualifying for the Shanghai Masters with a 5–2 victory over Anda Zhang. In the first round, he defeated Liang Wenbo 5–3, and he caused another upset in the last 16 by beating Shaun Murphy 5–2. He played Ali Carter in the quarter-finals, but lost 4–5 on the final black despite an earlier lead of 4–1.

He continued his solid form by reaching the quarter-finals at the Welsh Open, where he qualified by defeating Anthony Hamilton 4–2. He whitewashed number 5 seed Shaun Murphy 4–0 in the last 32, and in the last 16 he beat fellow Welshman and close friend Ryan Day 4–3. Stevens was drawn against John Higgins in the quarter-finals, but was edged out 3–5. Despite these performances, he was still not ranked in the top 16, so did not automatically qualify for the World Championship; in the fifth round of qualifying, he overcame Fergal O&#x27;Brien 10–9 on the final black to qualify for the first time since 2008. He was eliminated by Mark Allen in the first round of the main draw, losing four consecutive frames after leading 9–6. He then won the 2011 Championship League, beating Mark Williams 3–1 in the semi-final, and Shaun Murphy 3–1 in the final, to qualify for the Premier League.

His performances during the season were enough to see Stevens return to the elite top 16 in the world rankings for the first time since 2006, meaning he would no longer need to play qualifying matches to reach the main stage of the ranking events.

===2011/2012===
After losing in the first round of the Australian Goldfields Open to Liang Wenbo, Stevens reached the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters by defeating Stephen Lee and Martin Gould. However, his run was ended by compatriot Mark Williams, who whitewashed him 0–5.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A last 16 exit in the 2011 UK Championship to Ding Junhui followed, before Stevens reached his second ranking event quarter-final of the season in the German Masters courtesy of 5–1 victories over both Craig Steadman and Neil Robertson. He then lost to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 3–5.

Due to being ranked inside the top 16, Stevens played in his first Masters tournament since 2007 during the season and was beaten by John Higgins 2–6 in the first round. His first Premier League campaign since 2002 saw Stevens win 3 and lose 3 of the 6 matches he played to finish 7th in the 10-man league and therefore fail to make it to the play-offs.
Stevens finished runner-up to O&#x27;Sullivan in Event 7 of the minor-ranking Players Tour Championship series and with last 16 finishes coming in Event 9 and Event 11, he was ranked 17th in the Order of Merit, inside the top 24 who qualified for the Finals. There he played Ricky Walden in the last 24 and lost 0–5 in 50 minutes.

Stevens was defeated in the second round of the Welsh Open and had successive first round losses in the World Open and China Open to go into the World Championship in less than auspicious form. However, Stevens had an excellent run as he reached his sixth semi-final in the event, and first since 2005. He reached the last four with wins over Marco Fu (10–3), Barry Hawkins (13–11) and Ryan Day (13–5, having won 11 consecutive frames). He played Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-final and lost 10–17, meaning Stevens has not beaten his opponent in almost a decade. Stevens finished the season ranked world number 10, the highest he has ended the year since 2005.

===2012/2013===

Stevens withdrew from the season&#x27;s opening ranking event, the Wuxi Classic due to a bad back and could not advance beyond the second round in any of the next three events.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2012 UK Championship he beat Dominic Dale 6–1 and Marco Fu 6–4 to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since lifting the trophy in 2003. In a scrappy game versus Mark Davis, Stevens was beaten 4–6. Stevens missed a simple brown at 4–1 up against Mark Williams in the first round of the Masters and then made a series of errors during the rest of the match to lose 4–6. His second quarter-final of the season came at the German Masters, where he was defeated 3–5 by Marco Fu, before losing 2–4 to Stephen Maguire in the second round of the Welsh Open.

Stevens travelled to Haikou, China, for the World Open, but his cue failed to arrive on time for his first round match against David Gilbert. However, he beat Gilbert 5–4 with a borrowed cue and Shaun Murphy 5–3 with Mark Williams&#x27; cue before his own finally arrived for his quarter-final against Judd Trump. It was Trump this time who suffered cue troubles as his tip became damp during the match and Stevens took full advantage to triumph 5–3. He then came back from 4–5 against Neil Robertson in the semi-finals to win 6–5 and reach his first ranking event final since the 2008 Bahrain Championship. He faced Mark Allen in the final and, despite making two centuries, he was comfortably beaten 4–10. Stevens&#x27; season finished in disappointment as he lost in first round of the China Open 2–5 to Rory McLeod and 7–10 to Marco Fu in the World Championship, which saw him finish the year ranked world number 14.

===2013/2014===
At the season&#x27;s opening ranking event, the 2013 Wuxi Classic, Stevens beat Lu Ning 5–1, Liang Wenbo and Peter Lines both 5–3, and David Morris 5–2, to advance to the semi-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He threatened a brief comeback against John Higgins from 0–5 down, but lost 2–6. He gained some revenge over Higgins at the International Championship by beating him 6–2, before being eliminated by Ding Junhui 1–6 in the third round. He was beaten in the last 32 of both the UK Championship (2–6 by Robert Milkins) and the German Masters (4–5 by Shaun Murphy, after Stevens had led 4–1). He also lost deciding frames in the last 32 of the Welsh Open and World Open to Joe Perry and Judd Trump respectively.

His career took off after beating Martyn Holloway in the Regal Welsh under 16s regional tournament in Morriston. Stevens took a 2–1 victory on the black.

His father Morrell, who was also his manager, died unexpectedly in 2001. He was a close friend of Paul Hunter and was a pallbearer at his funeral.

<text>Outdoor Recreation New Zealand (ORNZ) was an organisation and political party in New Zealand from 2002 to 2007 that was concerned primarily with lobbying for the hunting and fishing fraternity, but also including people who participate in other outdoor sports. The party stated its goal was to fight &quot;the rapid erosion of sporting rights, resources and opportunities for outdoor sportspeople&quot;, claiming that environmental policies imposed unreasonable restrictions.

The party was proposed in October 2001. Shortly afterwards, a meeting near Nelson agreed to establish a political party. The founders of the party said that &quot;lobbying government has never been effective&quot;, and that establishing a political party was the only way to achieve their goals. On 8 March 2002, the party successfully registered with the Electoral Commission, having obtained the necessary five hundred members. This entitled it to seek and gain list votes under the MMP system. The party also gained government funding for broadcasting.

Outdoor Recreation New Zealand had its first test in the 2002 election. It won 25,985 votes, around 1.28% of the total.

In 2003, the party announced that it would be seeking an agreement with the larger United Future New Zealand party, which was already in parliament. This agreement, further elaborated on in 2004, saw Outdoor Recreation &quot;become affiliated&quot; to United Future. Outdoor Recreation retained its separate identity, but contested the 2005 election under the United Future banner. It did not gain any seats; none of the three MPs elected for United Future were from Outdoor Recreation.

In March 2006 the party split from United Future due to a dissatisfaction with the Christian evangelism within the party. ORNZ acting chairman Phil Hoare stating that: &quot;We strongly believe in the traditional bedrock values of our nation&#x27;s heritage but we also affirm the separation of church and state.&quot;

The party requested and received deregistration in 2007.

<text>Alan McManus (born 21 January 1971) is a Scottish retired professional snooker player, and a current commentator and pundit for ITV and Eurosport on snooker coverage. A mainstay of the world&#x27;s top sixteen during the 1990s and 2000s, he has won two ranking events, the 1994 Dubai Classic and the 1996 Thailand Open, and competed in the World Championship semi-finals in 1992, 1993 and 2016. He also won the 1994 Masters, ending Stephen Hendry&#x27;s five-year, 23-match unbeaten streak at the tournament with a 9–8 victory in the final. McManus announced his retirement on 9 April 2021 after losing 6–3 to Bai Langning in the second qualifying round of the 2021 World Snooker Championship.

==Career==

===Top 16 career and Masters winner===
McManus was long considered a consistently good player, having a record of fourteen consecutive seasons in the Top 16, but never managed to achieve the success of his contemporaries Stephen Hendry, Ken Doherty, Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, John Higgins and Mark Williams. He was ranked in the Top 16 from 1990 to 2006, dropping out after an unsuccessful 2005/2006 season. His highest ranking was sixth (in 1993/94 and 1996/97). McManus reached twenty-one professional semi-finals, but won only four events. He reached the semi-finals of the World Championship three times, but never appeared in a final. Until 2005, he had gone eleven years without reaching the quarter-finals of the tournament, despite consistent achievements in other events.

McManus&#x27;s resilience in snooker matchplay is shown by the fact that the first whitewash of his professional career came in his 0–5 defeat by Peter Ebdon at the 1998 Grand Prix, his 312th match as a professional player.

At the 1994 Masters, McManus defeated Nigel Bond 5–2 in the first round, Ken Doherty 5–1 in the quarter-finals, and then Neal Foulds 6–4 in the semi-final to set up his first triple crown tournament final against defending champion and fellow Scot Stephen Hendry. In what became the highlight of his career, he claimed the Masters title at Wembley, defeating Hendry 9–8 in the final and thus ending Hendry&#x27;s unbeaten run in the tournament, which dated back to 1989. He also won the tournament&#x27;s highest break prize, £10,000 for a 132 total clearance in the sixth frame of his first-round match against Bond.

His last major final was at the 2002 LG Cup at the Preston Guild Hall where he lost 5–9 to fellow-countryman Chris Small. A series of poor results in the 2005/2006 season saw him drop out of the top 16 for the first time since 1991. He reached the semi-finals of the 2006 Snooker Grand Prix, losing to Neil Robertson.

===Dropping out of the top 16===
He lost a World Championship qualifier 9–10 to journeyman Joe Delaney in 2007. This loss began an extremely quiet six-to-seven-year period for McManus, who then failed to qualify for any UK or World Championships between 2007 and 2013, and also struggled to qualify for the other ranking events (during the period between the 2006 Grand Prix and the 2013 Welsh Open, he failed to qualify for the main stages of 42 ranking events). This loss of form saw him quickly drop out of the top 16, then out of the top 32. His poor form reached a trough in the 2009/2010 season, where he failed to qualify for any of the main stages of the tournaments he took part in.

McManus was unable to qualify for any of the major venues during the 2011–12 season and he finished it ranked as number 52 in the world.

===Resurgence===

He made a good start to the 2012–13 season, beating Tony Drago and Robert Milkins to qualify for the final stages of the Australian Goldfields Open in Bendigo; there he beat local wildcard James Mifsud 5–0, before exiting the tournament by the same scoreline against Ding Junhui. At the 2013 Welsh Open, McManus reached his first quarter-final since the 2006 Grand Prix, with a 4–2 win over the number 16 seed Barry Hawkins, followed by a dramatic comeback to beat Joe Perry 4–3, after having trailed 0–3. He was beaten in the quarter-final 3–5 by compatriot Stephen Maguire. The following tournament, the Haikou World Open, saw McManus win three matches in qualifying to reach the latter stages of the tournament; he then beat local wildcard Lin Shuai 5–3, before facing compatriot John Higgins. McManus put in a good performance; he ultimately lost 3–5, but picked up valuable ranking points in the process.

He made a good start to the Players Tour Championship, reaching the quarter-finals of the first event, losing to Andrew Higginson by 4 frames to 3. He carried this good form to the PTC event 2, once again reaching the quarter-finals before losing 1–4 to eventual runner-up Stephen Maguire. However, McManus only managed four last-32 results from the rest of the events. This led to him being ranked 31st in the Order of Merit, just missing out on the top 28 players that qualified for the finals. At the 2013 World Snooker Championship McManus, in qualifying, beat one of India&#x27;s rising stars Aditya Mehta 10–9, in an epic encounter that lasted just over 9 hours. He then defeated 1995 World finalist Nigel Bond 10–8 in the penultimate qualifying round. In the final qualifying round he led Tom Ford 5–4 after the first session; he then reeled off five of the next six frames to book his place at the Crucible Theatre for the first time since 2006. In the first round he lost to Ding Junhui 5–10, winning £12,000.

===2013/2014 season===
At the start of the 2013–14 season McManus was ranked 49th in the World Rankings. At the 2013 Wuxi Classic qualifiers he won his match against Darryl Hill 5–3 to qualify for the last 64 of the event held in Wuxi. At the venue he defeated Ken Doherty 5–3 before losing to Dave Gilbert 2–5. At the first Asian Tour event, he bested players such as Michael White before beating local favorite Ding Junhui 4–2 in the last 16. He then defeated Yu Delu 4–1 in the quarter-finals, reaching his first semi-final in nine years. In the semi-final he lost to eventual winner Joe Perry 2–4, despite having been 2–1 up.

McManus qualified for the inaugural Indian Open, beating amateur Sydney Wilson 4–1 in qualifying. He was then beaten 1–4 in the last 64 by Zhang Anda. McManus followed up this result by qualifying for the International Championship in beating Darren Cook 6–0. He then defeated local wildcard Zhou Yuelong 6–5, coming back from 2–4 down. In the last 64 he produced the shock of the tournament by beating defending champion Judd Trump 6–5, having been 3–4 down. However he was defeated 4–6 by Ryan Day in the following round. At the 2013 UK Championship, McManus defeated Joel Walker 6–5, winning the match on a respotted black, before losing to Michael Holt 4–6 in the last 64. McManus reached the last 16 of the German Masters, defeating Jak Jones 5–1 in qualifying. At the Tempodrom he defeated Peter Ebdon and Jack Lisowski, both by 5–2 scorelines, before being himself beaten 2–5 by Michael Holt.

McManus continued his good form into the final European Tour event of the season, where he reached the last 16 by defeating players such as Neil Robertson and Graeme Dott before losing to Fergal O&#x27;Brien. Despite also reaching the last 16 of the final Asian Tour Event of the season, McManus narrowly missed out on qualification for the Players Championship Grand Final by one place. He lost to Mark King in the second round of the Welsh Open and failed to qualify for the China Open, but was to finish the season strongly. He reached the quarter-final of the World Open, losing to Mark Selby.

The 2014 World Snooker Championship, saw McManus beat John Higgins 10–7 in the first round and then defeat Ken Doherty 13–8, to set up another quarter-final with Mark Selby. McManus performed well early on, but Selby ran away with the match in the second session to leave the Scot trailing 4–12. McManus was able to claw back the first frame of the final session but Selby won the next frame to clinch the match 13–5.

===2014/2015 season===

McManus continued his good form into the 2014–15 season by reaching the last 16 of the first ranking event of the season, the 2014 Wuxi Classic, where he was beaten 2–5 by Barry Hawkins. He then reached the last 16 of the Australian Goldfields Open, before losing 3–5 to Judd Trump.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; McManus reached the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters by beating Jamie Jones to qualify, before defeating Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 5–3 and Stephen Maguire 5–1 but then lost to the eventual winner of the tournament Stuart Bingham 1–5. McManus was able to keep up his 100% record in qualifying matches for the season by comfortably defeating Michael Georgiou to qualify for the International Championship, but was edged out by Anthony McGill in the last 64 of the tournament.

McManus would lose in the first round of the UK Championship to Joel Walker. He won his first qualifier for the 2015 German Masters against Zak Surety but was then defeated in the final qualifying round by Matthew Selt. McManus had a good run in the Welsh Open, reaching the last 16 before losing to Maguire. He performed well in the season&#x27;s European Tour Events, finishing 18th on the Order of Merit. He played in four of the six events, reaching one quarter-final with a further three last 16 appearances. This gave him entry into the Grand Final where he was defeated 1–4 by Bingham in the first round. McManus won all three of his World Championship qualifying matches, defeating Michael Wasley, Andrew Pagett and Mitchell Mann to reach the main draw at the Crucible. However, an inconsistent performance against Ali Carter saw McManus bow out 5–10 in the first round.

===2015/2016 season===
McManus started strongly in the 2015–16 season, reaching the quarter-finals of the first event, the Riga Open, with wins over Stephen Maguire, Judd Trump and others before losing to the eventual champion Barry Hawkins 2–4. As McManus did not enter the Australian Goldfields Open, his first ranking event of the season came at the Shanghai Masters. He defeated Rory McLeod 5–4 to qualify for the tournament, and then defeated wildcard Yao Pengcheng 5–2, before losing 1–5 to Ding Junhui.

After an early exit in the Paul Hunter Classic, McManus reached the quarter-finals of the Ruhr Open, losing 3–4 to Tian Pengfei. It was during his first-round match in this tournament that he and his opponent Barry Pinches broke the record for the longest official frame of snooker. The frame lasted for 100 minutes and 24 seconds, with Pinches eventually winning the frame, although McManus would go on to win the match. The record stood until April 2017.

McManus qualified for the 2016 World Championship with comfortable victories over Michael Wasley, David Morris and Jimmy Robertson. In the first round at the Crucible he defeated his fellow-countryman Stephen Maguire 10–7, before overcoming Ali Carter 13–11 in round two. His quarter-final saw him come from 9–11 down against John Higgins to take the final four frames and win 13–11, setting up his first semi-final appearance at the World Championship since 1993. In that semi-final he lost to Ding Junhui 11–17. His end-of-season ranking of 20 was the highest he had been in a decade.

===2016/2017 season===
In the 2016–17 season the furthest McManus could progress in an event was at the World Open, where he beat Jamie Cope and Liang Wenbo, but he was thrashed 0–5 by Thepchaiya Un-Nooh. He would also reach the third round in the 2016 Paul Hunter Classic, defeating Andy Hicks and Christopher Keogan, both 4–1, before coming up short against Tom Ford.

===2017/2018 season===
McManus started the 2017–18 season at number 32 in the world rankings; and would reach the third round of both the 2017 China Championship and 2017 Paul Hunter Classic. He would also reach the second round of the 2017 UK Championship with a 6–3 win over Robin Hull; before losing a final frame decider to Jimmy Robertson 5–6.

<text>Charles Frédéric Girard (; 8 March 1822 – 29 January 1895) was a French biologist specializing in ichthyology and herpetology.

== Biography ==
Girard was born on 8 March 1822 in Mulhouse, France. He studied at the College of Neuchâtel, Switzerland, as a student of Louis Agassiz. In 1847, he accompanied Agassiz as his assistant to Harvard University. Three years later, Spencer Fullerton Baird called him to the Smithsonian Institution to work on its growing collection of North American reptiles, amphibians and fishes. He worked at the museum for the next ten years and published numerous papers, many in collaboration with Baird.

In 1854, he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. Besides his work at the Smithsonian, he managed to earn an M.D. from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. in 1856. In 1859 he returned to France and was awarded the Cuvier Prize by the Institute of France for his work on the North American reptiles and fishes two years later.

When the American Civil War broke out, he joined the Confederates as an agent for surgical and medical supplies. After the war, he remained in France and started a medical career. During the Franco-Prussian War he served as a military physician and published an important paper on the typhoid fever after the siege of Paris. He remained active as a medical doctor until ca. 1888. In the following three years, he published a few more papers on natural history.

He retired in 1891 and spent the rest of his life in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he died on 29 January 1895.

==Eponymy==
Girard is commemorated in the names of the following taxa:
*&quot;Girardinus&quot; Poey, 1854
*&quot;Girardinichthys&quot; Bleeker, 1860
*&quot;Cambarus girardianus&quot; Faxon, 1884
*&quot;Masticophis taeniatus girardi&quot; (Stejneger &amp; Barbour, 1917)
*&quot;Microcyphus girardi&quot; Desor
*&quot;Synapta girardi&quot; Pourtalès
*&quot;Vortex girardi&quot; O. Schmidt, 1857

<doc id="621379" wikidata="Q632078" url="?curid=621379" title="Oolite">
<text>Oolite or oölite () is a sedimentary rock formed from ooids, spherical grains composed of concentric layers. Strictly, oolites consist of ooids of diameter 0.25–2 millimetres; rocks composed of ooids larger than 2 mm are called pisolites. The term &quot;oolith&quot; can refer to oolite or individual ooids.

==Composition==
Ooids are most commonly composed of calcium carbonate (calcite or aragonite), but can be composed of phosphate, clays, chert, dolomite or iron minerals, including hematite. Dolomitic and chert ooids are most likely the result of the replacement of the original texture in limestone. Oolitic hematite occurs at Red Mountain near Birmingham, Alabama, along with oolitic limestone.

They are usually formed in warm, supersaturated, shallow, highly agitated marine water intertidal environments, though some are formed in inland lakes. The mechanism of formation starts with a small fragment of sediment acting as a &#x27;seed&#x27;, such as a piece of a shell. Strong intertidal currents wash the &#x27;seeds&#x27; around on the seabed, where they accumulate layers of chemically precipitated calcite from the supersaturated water. The oolites are commonly found in large current bedding structures that resemble sand dunes. The size of the oolites reflect the time that they were exposed to the water before they were covered with later sediment.

Oolites are often used in the home aquarium industry because their small grain size (0.2 to 1.22 mm) is ideal for shallow static beds and bottom covering of up to 1&quot; in depth. Also known as &quot;oolitic&quot; sand, the sugar-sized round grains of this sand pass easily through the gills of gobies and other sand-sifting organisms. This unusually smooth sand promotes the growth of bacteria, which are important biofilters in home aquaria. Because of its extremely small grain size, oolitic sand has a lot of surface area, which promotes high bacterial growth.

==Occurrence==

Some exemplar oolitic limestone was formed in England during the Jurassic period, and forms the Cotswold Hills, the Isle of Portland with its famous Portland Stone, and part of the North York Moors. A particular type, Bath Stone, gives the buildings of the World Heritage City of Bath their distinctive appearance. Carboniferous Hunts Bay Oolite lies under much of south Wales.

The Miami Rock Ridge of southeastern Florida, the islands of the Lower Florida Keys, and much of the Everglades, are underlain by Miami Oolite. This limestone was formed by deposition when shallow seas covered the area between periods of glaciation. The material consolidated and eroded during later exposure above the ocean surface.

One of the world&#x27;s largest freshwater lakebed oolites is the Shoofly Oolite, a section of the Glenns Ferry Formation on southwestern Idaho&#x27;s Snake River Plain. 10 million years ago, the Plain formed the bed of Lake Idaho. Wave action in the lake washed sediments back and forth in the shallows on the southwestern shore, forming ooids and depositing them on steeper benches near the shore in 2- to 40-foot thicknesses. When the lake drained (2 to 4 million years ago), the oolite was left behind, along with siltstone, volcanic tuffs and alluvium from adjacent mountain slopes. The other sediments eroded away, while the more resistant oolite weathered into hummocks, small arches and other natural &quot;sculptures&quot;. The Shoofly Oolite lies on public land west of Bruneau, Idaho managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The physical and chemical properties of the Shoofly Oolite are the setting for a suite of rare plants, which the BLM protects through land use management and on-site interpretation.

This type of limestone is also found in Indiana in the United States. The town of Oolitic, Indiana, was founded for the trade in limestone and bears its name. Quarries in Oolitic, Bedford, and Bloomington contributed the materials for such U.S. landmarks as the Empire State Building in New York and the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. Many of the buildings on the Indiana University campus in Bloomington are built with native oolitic limestone material, and the Soldiers&#x27; and Sailors&#x27; Monument in downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, is built mainly of grey oolitic limestone.

Oolites also appear in the Conococheague limestone, of Cambrian age, in the Great Appalachian Valley in Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Virginia.

Rogenstein is a term describing a specific type of oolite in which the cementing matter is argillaceous.

<text>Seo Jae-pil (; January 7, 1864 – January 5, 1951), better known by his English name Philip Jaisohn, was a Korean American politician, physician, and Korean independence activist. He was the first Korean to become a naturalized citizen of the United States. He also founded the &quot;Tongnip Sinmun&quot;, the first Korean newspaper written entirely in Hangul.

Jaisohn was one of the organizers of the failed Gapsin Coup in 1884. He was thus convicted for treason and sought refuge in the United States where he became a citizen and earned a medical doctorate. Upon returning to Korea in 1895, Jaisohn was offered a position as a chief advisor of the Joseon government. He declined, choosing to focus on reform movements where he advocated for democracy, Korean independence and self reliance from foreign intervention, numerous civil rights and universal suffrage. Jaisohn was forced to return to the United States in 1898, from where he participated in the First Korean Congress and advocated for the March 1st Movement and U.S. Government support for Korean independence. Jaisohn became a chief advisor to the United States Army Military Government in Korea after World War II and was elected as an interim representative in South Korea in the 1946 legislative election.

He died in 1951 shortly after returning to the United States during the Korean War. His remains were reinterred at the Seoul National Cemetery in 1994.

Jaisohn was an admirer of American-style liberalism and republicanism. He was also reform-minded, and sought to revise Confucianist culture and institutions in Korea.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Jaisohn was born on January 7, 1864, in Boseong County, Jeolla Province, Joseon. He was born into the . Jaisohn was the third son of Seo Gwang-hyo, who was a local magistrate, but was raised by his relatives in Seoul.

At a young age, Jaisohn was adopted by his father&#x27;s second cousin, Seo Gwang-ha and his wife. Jaisohn studied at Kim Seong-geun and Park Kyu-su&#x27;s private school during his adolescence, where he was exposed to the reformist ideals of Kim Ok-gyun.

===Political activist===
Jaisohn passed the civil service exam at the age of 18, becoming one of the youngest people to ever pass this exam, and as a result became a junior officer in 1882. Thereafter he was appointed to Gyoseokwan Bujeongja () and Seungmunwon Gajuseo (). In 1883 he was appointed to Seungmunwon Bujeongja () and Hunryunwon Bubongsa (). In the following year, he was sent to Japan where he studied both at the Keio Gijuku (the forerunner of the Keio University) and the Toyama Army Academy. In July 1884, his adoptive mother died, but he quickly returned to public service under special orders.

In his reports to the king, Jaisohn explained that Korea&#x27;s armed forces were useless and obsolete in the new world. These reports annoyed powerful conservatives, but it made Jaisohn widely known and respected among like-minded young intellectuals. By that time, a small but growing number of young intellectuals believed that fundamental reform had to occur or Korea would fall victim to the neighboring imperialist powers of Qing China, Japan, or Russia. He was appointed to Joryeon-guk Sagwanjang () shortly after.

In December 1884, Jaisohn, following Kim Ok-gyun, was involved in the Gapsin Coup, a radical attempt to overturn the old regime and establish equality among people. Jaisohn and Kim Ok-gyun, Park Yeong-hyo, Yun Chi-ho, Hong Yeong-shik, and others had planned a coup for seven months, from July to December 1884. He was appointed the Vice-Minister of Defense. The coup was defeated in three days, as China intervened by sending military troops.

As a result, his older half-brother, Seo Jae-hyeong, and younger brother, Seo Jae-chang, were killed. His biological father, Seo Gwang-hyo, and biological mother, Lady Yi of the Seongju Yi clan, were executed under a guilt-by-association system. His second wife, Lady Kim of the Gwangsan Kim clan, was sold into slavery, but committed suicide. His 3-year-old son had also died in 1885. Convicted of treason, Soh Jaipil lost half of his family and had to flee Korea to save his life.

His only remaining family was his older brother, older sister, younger brother, and younger sister, along with his eldest daughter and her husband. However, his older brother soon committed suicide by poisoning on September 5, 1888.

The majority of the 1884 revolutionaries fled to Japan. Unlike them, Jaisohn moved to the United States. He saw Japan as essentially a conduit for Western knowledge and ideas, but preferred to deal with what he saw as the source itself.

===Exile in the United States===

In 1885, early in his stay in America, Jaisohn worked part-time jobs. In 1886, Jaisohn lived in Norristown, Pennsylvania, and attended the Harry Hillman Academy (Wilkes-Barre, PA) thanks to the help of John Welles Hollenback. He began to use the name &quot;Philip Jaisohn&quot; at that time. In 1890, he became the first Korean immigrant to acquire United States citizenship. He studied medicine at Columbia Medical College (now George Washington University School of Medicine &amp; Health Sciences), and became the first Asian-American Doctor when he received his medical degree in 1892.

In 1894, he married Muriel Mary Armstrong, a distant relative of the former president of the United States, James Buchanan, and the eldest daughter of George B. Armstrong, credited as the founder of the U.S. Railway Mail Service. They had two daughters, Stephanie and Muriel.

===&quot;Tongnip Sinmun&quot;===
In 1894, Japan defeated China in the First Sino-Japanese war, which had occurred on the Korean Peninsula. The Korean cabinet was filled with reformists. Along with these political changes, the treason of the Gapsin Coup was pardoned, enabling Jaisohn&#x27;s return in 1895. In December 1895, he went to Incheon. The Joseon government wanted to appoint him as the Foreign Secretary, but he refused to take the position. In Korea, he endeavored to politically educate people. Jaisohn published the &quot;Tongnip Sinmun&quot; (also called &quot;The Independent&quot;) to transform the Korean population into an informed citizenry. He was the first to print his newspaper entirely in Hangul to extend readership to lower classes and women.

===Sowing the ideals of independence and democracy===
In the 1896 to 1898 civil rights movement and suffrage movements, Jaisohn&#x27;s goal was to ensure that Korea could drift away from the Chinese sphere of influence without falling too heavily under the influence of Russia or Japan. He was also behind the construction of the Independence Gate, which was initially meant to symbolize Korea&#x27;s independence from foreign interventionism. Apart from his journalistic and political activities, he delivered regular lectures on modern politics and the principles of democracy.

He promoted national independence as the principal political ideal and emphasized neutral diplomatic approaches to protect Korea from China, Russia and Japan. He also underscored the importance of public education, modernized industry and public hygiene. The Independence was particularly critical of misconduct by government officials, which caused strong reactions by the conservatives. Under the aegis of the Independence Club (), Jaisohn organized the All People&#x27;s Congress, an open public forum to debate over political issues. The Congress was hailed by young reformers and began to establish nationwide chapters.

In November 1897, Jaisohn finished the construction of the Independence Gate (독립문;獨立門). At this time he also ended the policy of Yeongeunmun (영은문;迎恩門). Yeongeunmun was the Korean policy of welcoming the Qing Manchu envoys (Yeongeunmun roughly translates from Korean to English as &quot;Welcome with kindness gate&quot;).

In 1898, conservatives accused Jaisohn and the Club of seeking to replace the monarchy with a republic, and the Korean government requested Jaisohn to return to the US. After his return, the Korean government ordered the club to disband and arrested 17 leaders, including Rhee Syngman.

=== Clerk and Company manage ===
In April to August 1898, he accompanied an army to the Spanish–American War. In 1899 he found employment as clerk for the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania.

In 1904, worked with Harold Deemer, who was a year younger, to create the &quot;Deemer and Jaisohn shop&quot;. It was a stationery and printing industry store. In 1915, the shop became called the Philip Jaisohn Company, and specialized in the printing industry.

=== Independence movements ===
In the United States, Jaisohn conducted medical research at the University of Pennsylvania and later became a successful printer in Philadelphia. When he heard the news of the March 1st Movement (1919), a nationwide protest against Japanese rule in Korea, Jaisohn convened the First Korean Congress, which was held in Philadelphia for three days on April 14–16, 1919. After the Congress, Jaisohn devoted his energies and private property to the freedom of Korea.

He organized the League of Friends of Korea in 21 cities with the help of Rev. Floyd W. Tomkins, rector of the Episcopal Church of the Holy Trinity, Philadelphia on Rittenhouse Square and established the &quot;Korean Information Bureau.&quot; He published a political journal called &quot;Korea Review&quot; to inform the American public of the situation in Korea, and to persuade the U.S. government to support the freedom of Koreans.

In the 1920s, Jaisohn, who had just turned 60, returned to research and spent his 60s and 70s working as a specialist doctor and micro-biologist, as well as occasionally publishing in peer-review academic journals.

Five years later in 1924, Jaisohn went legally bankrupt due to his political engagement and had to resume practicing medicine to make a living. At age 62, he became a student again at the University of Pennsylvania to renew his medical knowledge. After this, he published five research articles in the medical journals specializing in pathology. During World War II, he volunteered as a physical examination officer with the belief that the victory of the U.S. would bring freedom to Korea.

===Last days in Korea===

Jaisohn returned to Korea once again after Japan&#x27;s defeat in World War II. The U.S. Army Military Government in control of the southern part of Korea invited him to serve as chief adviser. In December 1946, he was elected to the Interim Legislative Assembly (). In May 1945, liberal and moderate socialist intellectuals selected him as candidate for presidency, but he declined. When the date of the first presidential election was confirmed by the United Nations, Jaisohn was petitioned to run for presidency by 3,000 people, including a young Kim Dae-jung, but he refused in the end.

Jaisohn felt that political unity was needed for a new nation, despite his uneasy relationship with the president elect Syngman Rhee. He decided to return to the United States in 1948. Suffering a heart attack a week earlier on December 29, Jaisohn died on January 5, 1951, during the Korean War, just two days before his 87th birthday.

His body was cremated, and his ashes were buried in Bib church in Philadelphia. In 1994 his remains were repatriated to South Korea. His ashes are buried in the Seoul National Cemetery.

==Philip Jaisohn Memorial House==

The Philip Jaisohn Memorial House in Media, Pennsylvania was Jaisohn&#x27;s home from 1925 to 1951. This house was bought when Jaisohn was in great financial difficulties, while his house in Philadelphia was pledged due to his devotion to the Korean independence. His Media home was acquired by the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation in 1987 and opened to the public in 1990. Since then, the Jaisohn House has been visited by many students and politicians from Korea such as former South Korean president and Nobel peace laureate Kim Dae-jung as well as Korean American immigrants and community neighbors.

On May 21, 1994, the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission and the Philip Jaisohn Memorial Foundation dedicated a historical marker for Jaisohn, stating:

American-educated medical doctor who sowed seeds of democracy in Korea, published its first modern newspaper (1896-98), and popularized its written language. The first Korean to earn a Western medical degree and become a U.S. citizen. He worked for Korean independence during the Japanese occupation, 1910-45. Chief Advisor to the U.S. Military Government in Korea, 1947-1948. This was his home for 25 years.

<text>Allied Domecq PLC was a multinational company, headquartered in Bristol, United Kingdom, that operated spirits, wine, and quick service restaurant businesses.

It was once a FTSE 100 Index constituent and the world&#x27;s second-largest spirits group but has been acquired by Pernod Ricard.

==History==
Allied Domecq was the result of a 1994 merger between Allied Lyons and Pedro Domecq S.A. Allied Lyons itself was the result of a 1978 merger between Allied Breweries and the food and catering group J. Lyons and Co. In 1999 the 3,500 strong pub division was sold to Burton-based Punch Taverns for £3bn after a bidding war with Whitbread.

In early 2005, a takeover bid for the company was launched by French-based rival Pernod Ricard S.A. Pernod Ricard successfully completed acquisition on 26 July 2005 and sold off the overlapping spirits brands to U.S.-based competitor Fortune Brands and British-based multinational Diageo. On 12 December 2005, Pernod Ricard announced that it had agreed to sell the restaurant businesses (Dunkin&#x27; Brands) to a consortium of three US private equity firms (Thomas H. Lee Partners, the Carlyle Group and Bain Capital LLP) for $2.43 billion. The closing of the sale occurred on 1 March 2006.

== Distilleries ==
Many malt distilleries were operated by Allied Domecq and former company Allied Lyons. Some are still open under new owners:

<text>Confessions (Latin: &quot;Confessiones&quot;) is an autobiographical work by Augustine of Hippo, consisting of 13 books written in Latin between AD 397 and 400. The work outlines Augustine&#x27;s sinful youth and his conversion to Christianity. Modern English translations of it are sometimes published under the title The Confessions of Saint Augustine in order to distinguish the book from other books with similar titles. Its original title was Confessions in Thirteen Books, and it was composed to be read out loud with each book being a complete unit.

&quot;Confessions&quot; is generally considered one of Augustine&#x27;s most important texts. It is widely seen as the first Western autobiography ever written (Ovid had invented the genre at the start of the first century AD with his &quot;Tristia&quot;) and was an influential model for Christian writers throughout the Middle Ages. Henry Chadwick wrote that &quot;Confessions&quot; will &quot;always rank among the great masterpieces of western literature&quot;.

==Summary==
The work is not a complete autobiography, as it was written during Augustine&#x27;s early 40s and he lived long afterwards, producing another important work, &quot;The City of God&quot;. Nonetheless, it does provide an unbroken record of his development of thought and is the most complete record of any single person from the 4th and 5th centuries. It is a significant theological work, featuring spiritual meditations and insights.

In the work, Augustine writes about how he regrets having led a sinful and immoral life. He discusses his regrets for following the Manichaean religion and believing in astrology. He writes about his friend Nebridius&#x27;s role in helping to persuade him that astrology was not only incorrect but evil, and Saint Ambrose&#x27;s role in his conversion to Christianity. The first nine books are autobiographical and the last four are commentary and significantly more philosophical. He shows intense sorrow for his sexual sins and writes on the importance of sexual morality. The books were written as prayers to God, thus the title, based on the Psalms of David; and it begins with &quot;For Thou hast made us for Thyself and our hearts are restless till they rest in Thee.&quot; The work is thought to be divisible into books which symbolize various aspects of the Trinity and trinitarian belief.

==Outline (by book)==

# His infancy, and boyhood up to age 14. Starting with his infancy, Saint Augustine reflects on his personal childhood in order to draw universal conclusions about the nature of infancy: the child is inherently violent if left to its own devices because of Original Sin. Later, he reflects on choosing pleasure and reading secular literature over studying Scripture, choices which he later comes to understand as ones for which he deserved the punishment of his teachers, although he did not recognize that during his childhood.
# Augustine continues to reflect on his adolescence during which he recounts two examples of his grave sins that he committed as a sixteen-year-old: the development of his God-less lust and the theft of a pear from his neighbor&#x27;s orchard, despite never wanting for food. In this book, he explores the question of why he and his friends stole pears when he had many better pears of his own. He explains the feelings he experienced as he ate the pears and threw the rest away to the pigs. Augustine argues that he most likely would not have stolen anything had he not been in the company of others who could share in his sin.
# He begins the study of rhetoric at Carthage, where he develops a love of wisdom through his exposure to Cicero&#x27;s &quot;Hortensius.&quot; He blames his pride for lacking faith in Scripture, so he finds a way to seek truth regarding good and evil through Manichaeism. At the end of this book, his mother, Monica, dreams about her son&#x27;s re-conversion to Catholic doctrine.
# Between the ages of 19 and 28, Augustine forms a relationship with an unnamed woman who, though faithful, is not his lawfully wedded wife, with whom he has a son, Adeodatus. At the same time that he returned to his hometown Tagaste to teach, a friend fell sick, was baptized in the Catholic Church, recovered slightly, then died. The death of his friend depresses Augustine, who then reflects on the meaning of love of a friend in a mortal sense versus love of a friend in God; he concludes that his friend&#x27;s death affected him severely because of his lack of love in God. Things he used to love become hateful to him because everything reminds him of what was lost. Augustine then suggests that he began to love his life of sorrow more than his fallen friend. He closes this book with his reflection that he had attempted to find truth through the Manicheans and astrology, yet devout Church members, who he claims are far less intellectual and prideful, have found truth through greater faith in God.
# While Augustine is aged 29, he begins to lose faith in Manichean teachings, a process that starts when the Manichean bishop Faustus visits Carthage. Augustine is unimpressed with the substance of Manichaeism, but he has not yet found something to replace it. He feels a sense of resigned acceptance to these fables as he has not yet formed a spiritual core to prove their falsity. He moves to teach in Rome where the education system is more disciplined. He does not stay in Rome for long because his teaching is requested in Milan, where he encounters the bishop Ambrose. He appreciates Ambrose&#x27;s style and attitude, and Ambrose exposes him to a more spiritual, figurative perspective of God, which leads him into a position as catechumen of the Church.
# The sermons of Ambrose draw Augustine closer to Catholicism, which he begins to favor over other philosophical options. In this section his personal troubles, including ambition, continue, at which point he compares a beggar, whose drunkenness is &quot;temporal happiness,&quot; with his hitherto failure at discovering happiness. Augustine highlights the contribution of his friends Alypius and Nebridius in his discovery of religious truth. Monica returns at the end of this book and arranges a marriage for Augustine, who separates from his previous concubine, finds a new mistress, and deems himself to be a &quot;slave of lust.&quot;
# In his mission to discover the truth behind good and evil, Augustine is exposed to the Neoplatonist view of God. He finds fault with this thought, however, because he thinks that they understand the nature of God without accepting Christ as a mediator between humans and God. He reinforces his opinion of the Neoplatonists through the likeness of a mountain top: &quot;It is one thing to see, from a wooded mountain top, the land of peace, and not to find the way to it… it is quite another thing to keep to the way which leads there, which is made safe by the care of the heavenly Commander, where they who have deserted the heavenly army may not commit their robberies, for they avoid it as a punishment.&quot; From this point, he picks up the works of the apostle Paul which &quot;seized [him] with wonder.&quot;
# He further describes his inner turmoil on whether to convert to Christianity. Two of his friends, Simplicianus and Ponticianus, tell Augustine stories about the conversions of Marius Victorinus and Saint Anthony. While reflecting in a garden, Augustine hears a child&#x27;s voice chanting &quot;take up and read.&quot; Augustine picks up a book of St. Paul&#x27;s writings (codex apostoli, 8.12.29) and reads the passage it opens to, Romans 13:13–14: &quot;Not in revelry and drunkenness, not in debauchery and wantonness, not in strife and jealousy; but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and as for the flesh, take no thought for its lusts.&quot; This action confirms his conversion to Catholicism. His friend Alypius follows his example.
# In preparation for his baptism, Augustine concludes his teaching of rhetoric. Ambrose baptizes Augustine along with Adeodatus and Alypius. Augustine then recounts how the church at Milan, with his mother in a leading role, defends Ambrose against the persecution of Justina. Upon his return with his mother to Africa, they share in a religious vision in Ostia. Soon after, Saint Monica dies, followed soon after by his friends Nebridius and Verecundus. By the end of this book, Augustine remembers these deaths through the prayer of his newly adopted faith: &quot;May they remember with holy feeling my parents in this transitory light, and my brethren under Thee, O Father, in our Catholic Mother [the Church], and my fellow citizens in the eternal Jerusalem, for which the pilgrimage of Thy people sighs from the start until the return. In this way, her last request of me will be more abundantly granted her in the prayers of many through these my confessions than through my own prayers.&quot;
# Augustine shifts from personal memories to introspective evaluation of the memories themselves and of the self, as he continues to reflect on the values of confessions, the significance of prayer, and the means through which individuals can reach God. It is through both this last point and his reflection on the body and the soul that he arrives at a justification for the existence of Christ.
# Augustine analyzes the nature of creation and of time as well as its relationship with God. He explores issues surrounding presentism. He considers that there are three kinds of time in the mind: the present with respect to things that are past, which is the memory; the present with respect to things that are present, which is contemplation; and the present with respect to things that are in the future, which is expectation. He relies on Genesis, especially the texts concerning the creation of the sky and the earth, throughout this book to support his thinking.
# Through his discussion of creation, Augustine relates the nature of the divine and the earthly as part of a thorough analysis of both the rhetoric of Genesis and the plurality of interpretations that one might use to analyze Genesis. Comparing the scriptures to a spring with streams of water spreading over an immense landscape, he considers that there could be more than one true interpretation and each person can draw whatever true conclusions from the texts. 
# He concludes the text by exploring an allegorical interpretation of Genesis, through which he discovers the Trinity and the significance of God&#x27;s creation of man. Based on his interpretation, he espouses the significance of rest as well as the divinity of Creation: &quot;For, then shalt Thou rest in us, in the same way that Thou workest in us now So, we see these things which Thou hast made, because they exist, but they exist because Thou seest them. We see, externally, that they exist, but internally, that they are good; Thou hast seen them made, in the same place where Thou didst see them as yet to be made.&quot;

==Purpose==
&quot;Confessions&quot; was not only meant to encourage conversion, but it offered guidelines for how to convert. Augustine extrapolates from his own experiences to fit others&#x27; journeys. Augustine recognizes that God has always protected and guided him. This is reflected in the structure of the work. Augustine begins each book within &quot;Confessions&quot; with a prayer to God. For example, both books VIII and IX begin with &quot;you have broken the chains that bound me; I will sacrifice in your honor&quot;. Because Augustine begins each book with a prayer, Albert C. Outler, a professor of theology at Southern Methodist University, argues that &quot;Confessions&quot; is a &quot;pilgrimage of grace… [a] retrac[ing] [of] the crucial turnings of the way by which [Augustine] had come. And since he was sure that it was God&#x27;s grace that had been his prime mover in that way, it was a spontaneous expression of his heart that cast his self-recollection into the form of a sustained prayer to God.&quot; Not only does &quot;Confessions&quot; glorify God but it also suggests God&#x27;s help in Augustine&#x27;s path to redemption.

Written after the legalization of Christianity, &quot;Confessions&quot; dated from an era where martyrdom was no longer a threat to most Christians as was the case two centuries earlier. Instead, a Christian&#x27;s struggles were usually internal. Augustine clearly presents his struggle with worldly desires such as lust. Augustine&#x27;s conversion was quickly followed by his ordination as a priest in 391 AD and then appointment as bishop in 395 AD. Such rapid ascension certainly raised criticism of Augustine. &quot;Confessions&quot; was written between 397 and 398 AD, suggesting self-justification as a possible motivation for the work. With the words &quot;I wish to act in truth, making my confession both in my heart before you and in this book before the many who will read it&quot; in Book X Chapter 1, Augustine both confesses his sins and glorifies God through humility in His grace, the two meanings that define &quot;confessions&quot;, in order to reconcile his imperfections not only to his critics but also to God.

==Hermeneutics==
St. Augustine suggested a method to improve the Biblical exegesis in presence of particularly difficult passages. Readers shall believe all the Scripture is inspired by God and that each author wrote nothing in which he did not believe personally, or that he believed to be false. Readers must distinguish philologically, and keep separate, their own interpretations, the written message and the originally intended meaning of the messenger and author (in Latin: &quot;intentio&quot;).

Disagreements may arise &quot;either as to the truth of the message itself or as to the messenger&#x27;s meaning&quot; (XII.23). The truthfulness of the message itself is granted by God who inspired it to the extensor and who made possible the transmission and spread of the content across centuries and among believers.

In principle, the reader isn&#x27;t capable of ascertaining what the author had in mind when he wrote a biblical book, but he has the duty to do his best to approach that original meaning and intention without contradicting the letter of the written text. The interpretation must stay &quot;within the truth&quot; (XII.25) and not outside it.

==Audience==
Much of the information about Augustine comes directly from his own writing. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; provide significant insight into the first thirty-three years of his life. Augustine does not paint himself as a holy man, but as a sinner. The sins that Augustine confesses are of many different severities and of many different natures, such as lust/adultery, stealing, and lies. For example, in the second chapter of Book IX Augustine references his choice to wait three weeks until the autumn break to leave his position of teaching without causing a disruption. He wrote that some &quot;may say it was sinful of me to allow myself to occupy a chair of lies even for one hour&quot;. In the introduction to the 1961 translation by R. S. Pine-Coffin he suggests that this harsh interpretation of Augustine&#x27;s own past is intentional so that his audience sees him as a sinner blessed with God&#x27;s mercy instead of as a holy figurehead. Considering the fact that the sins Augustine describes are of a rather common nature (e.g. the theft of pears when a young boy), these examples might also enable the reader to identify with the author and thus make it easier to follow in Augustine&#x27;s footsteps on his personal road to conversion. This identification is an element of the protreptic and paraenetic character of the &quot;Confessions&quot;.

Due to the nature of &quot;Confessions&quot;, it is clear that Augustine was not only writing for himself but that the work was intended for public consumption. Augustine&#x27;s potential audience included baptized Christians, catechumens, and those of other faiths. Peter Brown, in his book &quot;The Body and Society&quot;, writes that &quot;Confessions&quot; targeted &quot;those with similar experience to Augustine&#x27;s own.&quot; Furthermore, with his background in Manichean practices, Augustine had a unique connection to those of the Manichean faith. &quot;Confessions&quot; thus constitutes an appeal to encourage conversion.

==Legacy==
&quot;Confessions&quot; is one of the most influential works in not only the history of Christian theology, but philosophy in general.

Kierkegaard and his Existentialist philosophy were substantially influenced by Augustine&#x27;s contemplation of the nature of his soul. Ludwig Wittgenstein considered the book to be possibly &quot;the most serious book ever written&quot;, discussing or mentioning it in the Blue Book, Philosophical Investigations and Remarks on Frazer&#x27;s Golden Bough. While a professor at Cambridge he kept a copy on his bookshelf.

&quot;Confessions&quot; exhibited a significant influence on German philosopher Martin Heidegger, it has been said that the book served as a &quot;central source of concepts for the early Heidegger&quot;. As such he refers to it in &quot;Being and Time&quot;.

<doc id="621402" wikidata="Q170059" url="?curid=621402" title="Manuel Candamo">
<text>Manuel González de Candamo e Iriarte (July 14, 1841 – May 7, 1904) served as the 33rd President of Peru from 1903 until his death in 1904. He also served as Interim President of Peru, officially as the President of the Government Junta, from September 8, 1903, until his death the following year.

==Early life and family==
Born in a wealthy family, Manuel was the son of Pedro González de Candamo e Astorga (Puerto de Valparaiso, Chile, June 30, 1799 – Lima, January 22, 1866), Peruvian Ambassador – then the richest man in Peru – and wife María de las Mercedes Iriarte e Odria; paternal grandson of Alfonso González de Candamo y Prieto (born in Asturias the son of Gaspar González de Candamo and wife Eulalia Prieto) and wife Petronila de Astorga y Urizar (born in Valparaiso, Chile) and maternal grandson of Pedro Ignacio Iriarte y Velasco-Patiño, mine owner from Huancayo, who bought the Hacienda Lobatón in 1819 and half of the Hacienda Cónsac, and wife Paula Odria y Granados, daughter of the owners of Hacienda Rumichaca Juan Ignacio Odria and wife Manuela Granados, sister of Marcelo Granados (La Asunción de Mito, 1758 – ?), Governor of La Trinidad de Huancayo.

Manuel Candamo spend his early years in the College of Our Lady of Guadalupe. After graduating from high school, he was accepted in the National University of San Marcos, where he obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree on Jurisprudence.

==Early political career==

===Pezet and the Chinchan Islands War===
In 1863, Cándamo started to work for &quot;El Comercio&quot;, one of the oldest newspapers in the capital. From there, he was a harsh critic of President Juan Antonio Pezet and the &quot;Vivanco-Pareja Treaty&quot;, specifically for the way of how the government was handling the diplomatic crisis with Spain. For his actions, he was exiled to Chile, returning only after Mariano Ignacio Prado&#x27;s successfully launched a coup against Pezet.

After the revolution, he was an active supporter of Prado during the Chincha Islands War. When the Peruvian Congress refused to recognize Prado&#x27;s government, Cándamo traveled to Chile as part of the Peruvian diplomatic mission. He did not stay on Chile, and left that country for Europe and Asia.

===Civilista Party===
Manuel Cándamo, together with Manuel Pardo, was among the founding members of the Civilista Party. The party itself achieved public notoriety for being the first organized political party in Peru, and because it was also the first one to be composed primarily of civilians. During this period, Cándamo successfully started once again his political career and several economic businesses.

==War of the Pacific and Reconstruction==
After the collapse of the Peruvian Southern Armies and the imminent invasion of Lima, Cándamo took part in the defense of the city, fighting in the Battles of San Juan and Miraflores. When the city is occupied by the Chilean Army, Cándamo and several other prominent politicians are deported to Chile due to their opposition to any peace proposal that involved ceding Tarapacá, Tacna and Arica to the Chileans.

Candamo returned to Peru after the Treaty of Ancón was signed and the war over, and is once again deported for his opposition to President Miguel Iglesias and support to Andrés Avelino Cáceres. Once Iglesias is overthrown and Cáceres is in power, Candamo was elected to the Senate, reaching its presidency in 1888, 1890 and 1892.

==Later political career==

===President of the Junta===
A member of the Civilista Party, Candamo served as mayor of Lima. After Andrés Avelino Cáceres was forced to resign from the Presidency in 1894, Candamo was selected to head a &quot;Provisional Government Junta&quot; and to call for new elections. Nicolás de Piérola, allied with the Civilista Party, won the election.

===President of the Senate===
During the administration of Eduardo López de Romaña, he was elected President of the Peruvian Senate (both 1897 and 1901). This was done after the Civilista and Democratic parties reached a compromise and divided their political influence in the government.

For the Election of 1903, Cándamo was regarded as a moderate candidate and the more trusted political figure in the Civilista Party. After being elected president, Cándamo became ill and died in office. He was married to Teresa Alvarez-Calderón.

Following a brief interim government headed by Serapio Calderón, Cándamo was succeeded by his foreign minister José Pardo.

==Personal life==
Manuel Candamo married Teresa Álvarez-Calderón, and had two daughters. One daughter, Teresa De La Cruz, founded the convent Canonesas de La Cruz, and was given the title of Servant of God in 1981 by the Catholic Church, which means she is being considered for possible sainthood.

He was the brother-in-law of Anglo-Peruvian guano millionaire John Pablo Bryce, and thus a great-great uncle Alexandra Hamilton, Duchess of Abercorn, and Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster, as well as a great uncle of Janet Mercedes Bryce, Marchioness of Milford Haven, wife of David Mountbatten, 3rd Marquess of Milford Haven.

He was the great-uncle of Clotilde de Silva y Gonzáles de Candamo (July 19, 1898 – December 12, 1978), daughter of the 10th Marquis de Arcicóllar, second wife of Hans Heinrich XV von Hochberg, Prince of Pless, and after divorce the wife of Hans Heinrich XV&#x27;s son Bolko, with two children by each husband.

<doc id="621404" wikidata="Q549215" url="?curid=621404" title="Anisotropic filtering">
<text>In 3D computer graphics, anisotropic filtering (AF) is a technique that improves the appearance of textures, especially on surfaces viewed at sharp angles. It helps make textures look sharper and more detailed by reducing blur and aliasing that can occur when surfaces are angled away from the viewer. Anisotropic filtering works by applying different amounts of filtering in different directions, unlike simpler methods like bilinear and trilinear filtering which filter equally in all directions. 

While it requires more processing power than these simpler methods, anisotropic filtering became a standard feature in most graphics cards in the late 1990s and is now commonly used in games and other 3D applications, often with user-adjustable settings.

== Comparison to isotropic algorithms ==

Anisotropic filtering enhances texture sharpness, counteracting the blur introduced by mipmapping, a common anti-aliasing technique. Anisotropic filtering can therefore be said to maintain crisp texture detail at all viewing orientations while providing fast anti-aliased texture filtering.

In traditional isotropic mipmapping, downsizing at each level halves the resolution on each axis simultaneously. As a result, when rendering a horizontal plane at an oblique angle to the camera, the minification would provide an insufficient horizontal resolution due to the reduction of image frequency in the vertical axis. That is, when sampling to avoid aliasing on a high-frequency axis, the other texture axes will be similarly downsampled and therefore potentially blurred.

With mipmap anisotropic filtering, a texture of resolution 256px × 256px would not only be downsampled to 128px × 128px, but also to other non-square resolutions, such as 256px × 128px and 32px × 128px. These &quot;anisotropically downsampled&quot; images can be probed when the texture-mapped image frequency is different for each texture axis. Then, one axis is not blurred due to the screen frequency of another axis, and aliasing is still avoided.

Mipmapping and its associated axis-alignment constraints mean it is suboptimal for true anisotropic filtering and is used here for illustrative purposes only. More general anisotropic filtering methods support anisotropic probes that are not necessarily axis-aligned in texture space, allowing for diagonal anisotropy.

== Degree of anisotropy ==
Different degrees or ratios of anisotropic filtering can be applied during rendering. This degree refers to the maximum ratio of anisotropy supported by the filtering process. For example, 4:1 (pronounced “4-to-1”) anisotropic filtering will continue to sharpen more oblique textures beyond the range sharpened by 2:1. 

In practice, this means that in highly oblique texturing situations, a 4:1 filter will be twice as sharp as a 2:1 filter (it will display frequencies double that of the 2:1 filter). However, most of the scene will not require the 4:1 filter; only the more oblique and usually more distant pixels will require the sharper filtering. This means that as the degree of anisotropic filtering continues to double there are diminishing returns in terms of visible quality with fewer and fewer rendered pixels affected, and the results become less obvious to the viewer; only a relatively few highly oblique pixels, mostly on more distant geometry, will display visibly sharper textures in the scene with the higher degree of anisotropic filtering. The performance penalty also diminishes because fewer pixels require the data fetches of greater anisotropy.

Current hardware rendering implementations set an upper bound on this ratio due to the additional hardware complexity and the aforementioned diminishing returns. Applications and users are able to adjust the ratio through driver and software settings up to the threshold.

== Implementation ==
True anisotropic filtering probes the texture anisotropically on the fly on a per-pixel basis for any orientation of anisotropy.

In graphics hardware, typically when the texture is sampled anisotropically, several probes (texel samples) of the texture around the center point are taken on a sample pattern mapped according to the projected shape of the texture at that pixel. Earlier software methods have used summed-area tables.

Each anisotropic filtering probe is often in itself a filtered mipmap sample, which adds more sampling to the process. Sixteen trilinear anisotropic samples might require 128 samples from the stored texture, as trilinear mipmap filtering needs to take four samples for each of the two mipmaps and then anisotropic sampling (at 16-tap) needs to take sixteen of these trilinear filtered probes.

However, this level of filtering complexity is not required all the time. There are commonly available methods to reduce the amount of work the video rendering hardware must do.

The anisotropic filtering method most commonly implemented on graphics hardware is the composition of the filtered pixel values from only one line of mipmap samples. In general, the method of building a texture filter result from multiple probes filling a projected pixel sampling into texture space is referred to as &quot;footprint assembly&quot;, even where implementation details vary.

== Performance and optimization ==
The sample count required can make anisotropic filtering extremely bandwidth-intensive. Multiple textures are common; each texture sample could be four bytes or more, so each anisotropic pixel could require 512 bytes from texture memory, although texture compression is commonly used to reduce this.

A video display device can easily contain over two million pixels, and desired application framerates are often upwards of 60 frames per second. As a result, the required texture memory bandwidth may grow to large values. Ranges of hundreds of gigabytes per second of pipeline bandwidth for texture rendering operations is not unusual where anisotropic filtering operations are involved.

Fortunately, several factors mitigate in favor of better performance:
* The probes themselves share cached texture samples, both inter-pixel and intra-pixel.
* Even with 16-tap anisotropic filtering, not all 16 taps are always needed because only distant &quot;highly oblique&quot; pixel fills tend to be highly anisotropic.
* Highly anisotropic pixel fill tends to cover small regions of the screen (i.e. generally under 10%)
* Texture magnification filters (as a general rule) require no anisotropic filtering.

Common names include goldenrain tree, pride of India, China tree, and the varnish tree.

==Description==
It is a small to medium-sized deciduous tree growing to tall, with a broad, dome-shaped crown. The leaves are pinnate, long, rarely to , with 7–15 leaflets 3–8 cm long, with a deeply serrated margin; the larger leaflets at the midpoint of the leaf are sometimes themselves pinnate but the leaves are not consistently fully bipinnate as in the related &quot;Koelreuteria bipinnata&quot;.

The flowers are yellow, with four petals, growing in large terminal panicles long. The fruit is a three-part inflated bladderlike pod, 3–6 cm long and 2–4 cm broad, that is green, then ripening from orange to pink in autumn. It contains several dark brown to black seeds 5–8 mm diameter.

==Taxonomy==
===Publication===
First published in 1772, in the 1771 edition of &quot;Novi commentarii academiae scientiarum imperialis Petropolitanae&quot;, attributed to Erik Laxmann.

===Varieties===
Several varieties have been described:
*&quot;K. paniculata&quot; var. &quot;paniculata&quot;. Northern China and Korea. Leaves single-pinnate.
*&quot;K. paniculata&quot; var. &quot;apiculata&quot; (Rehder &amp; E.H.Wilson) Rehder (syn. &quot;K. apiculata&quot;). Western China (Sichuan), intergrading with var. &quot;paniculata&quot; in central China. Leaves with larger leaflets commonly bipinnate.
*&quot;K. paniculata&quot; &quot;var. fastigiata.&quot; Small growing columnar form originated in 1888.
*&quot;K. paniculata var. variegata.&quot; a form with variegated foliage.

But none of them are accepted.

==Cultivation==
K. paniculata has been cultivated since ancient times. In the Zhou dynasty it was one of the five official memorial trees (alongside P. tabuliformis, P. orientalis, S. japonicum and certain Poplars), being planted next to the tombs of scholars.

It is popularly grown as an ornamental tree in temperate regions all across the world because of the aesthetic appeal of its flowers, leaves and seed pods. Several cultivars have been selected for garden planting, including &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27; with a narrow crown, and &#x27;September Gold&#x27;, flowering in late summer.

In the UK the cultivar ‘Coral Sun’ has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

In some areas, notably the eastern United States and particularly in Florida, it is considered an invasive species.

<text>Arun Gulab Gawli (born 17 July 1955) also known as Arun Gulab Ahir, is an Indian politician, underworld don and retired gangster. Gawli and his brother Kishor (Pappa) entered the Mumbai underworld in the 1970s, when they joined the &quot;Byculla Company&quot;, a criminal gang led by Rama Naik and Babu Reshim, operating in the central Mumbai areas of Byculla, Parel and Saat Rasta. In 1988, after Rama Naik was killed in a police encounter, Gawli took over the gang and began operating it from his residence, Dagdi Chawl. Under his control, the gang controlled most criminal activities in the central Mumbai areas. Throughout the late eighties and nineties, Gawli&#x27;s gang was involved in a power struggle with Dawood Ibrahim&#x27;s D-Company gang. Gawli is also the founder of the Akhil Bharatiya Sena political party based in Maharashtra.

==Early and personal life==
Arun Gawli was born in Kopargaon, Ahmednagar district, Maharashtra, India. Gawli first worked at Simplex Mills in Chinchpokli, then at Godrej &amp; Boyce company in Vikhroli and later at Crompton Greaves in Kanjurmarg before working at gangster Parasnath Pandey&#x27;s gambling den. He married Zubeida Mujawar, who later became Asha Gawli after marriage and converted to Hinduism. She was a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Maharashtra and they both have five children, two sons and three daughters including Mahesh and Geeta, Yogita, Yatika Geeta is a first term ABS corporator from the Chinchpokli assembly constituency. Gawli&#x27;s nephew Sachin Ahir is an MLA and is the former Maharashtra Minister of State for Housing. Gawli&#x27;s uncle Hukumchand Yadav was a legislator from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.

==Criminal activities==
After working short stints as a factory worker at Simplex Mills Chinchpokli, Godrej &amp; Boyce company Vikhroli and Crompton Greaves Kanjurmarg, Arun Gawli and his brother then started working for gangster Parasnath Pandey who ran a matka (gambling) and liquor den in Byculla. 
In 1977, gangsters Rama Naik and Babu Reshim teamed up and decided to form a joint Maharashtrian gang by uniting several individual gangsters from Central Mumbai suburbs of Agripada, Byculla, Mazgaon, Saat Rasta, Parel and Lalbaug. The new gang was called &quot;Byculla Company&quot; and the first mission was to eliminate gangsters like Kundan Dubey, Mohan Sarmalkar and Shashi Rasam, leader of the Cobra Gang. All of them were operating in Central Mumbai and both Rama Naik and Babu Reshim had a score to settle with them.

Very soon other Maharashtrian gangsters from Central Mumbai like Sada Pawle, Kiran Walawalkar, Ganesh Bhosle alias Vakil, Chandrashekhar Mirashi, Ashok Choudhary alias Chhota Babu joined this new gang.
When his friend from Crompton Greaves Sada Pawle joined this gang, Gawli was also quick to join the Byculla Company as he and Rama Naik were schoolmates and he also knew Babu Reshim through Dilip Prabhu who was the workers union leader at Crompton Greaves. More importantly, Gawli also had a score to settle with gangster Parasnath Pandey.
Between 1977 and 1980, the Byculla Company first eliminated Shashi Rasam and his Cobra gang, followed by the murders of gangsters Parasnath Pandey, Mohan Sarmalkar and failed attempt on the life of Kundan Dubey who later fled from Mumbai.

The big break for Byculla Company came when Dawood Ibrahim&#x27;s elder brother Saabir was murdered in 1981 by Samad Khan, Amirzada and Alamzeb of the Pathan gang. Dawood pleaded with Rama Naik for help and offered a hefty ransom in return. Naik accepted the deal and the Byculla Company including Arun Gawli and Rama Naik were involved in the murder plan of Samad Khan, nephew of Karim Lala and heir to the Pathan gang in 1984.

Between 1984 and early 1988, Gawli and his mentor Naik managed the main criminal operations for Dawood Ibrahim in Mumbai. However, in early 1988, Rama Naik and Sharad Shetty, a henchman of Dawood from west Mumbai got into a property dispute over a large plot of land at Jogeshwari. Dawood sided with Shetty and Naik ended up feeling miffed with Dawood despite helping him eliminate his most dreaded enemy, Samad Khan. Naik and Gawli stopped managing Dawood&#x27;s operations in Central Mumbai. A few months later, Naik was shot dead in a fake police encounter. Gawli realized that this encounter was done at the behest of Dawood and swore revenge. This unleashed a very violent gang-war between Arun Gawli and Dawood Ibrahim resulting in multiple shootouts and deaths at both sides. The brutal gang-war continued until Gawli was arrested by the police and imprisoned in 1994, again at the behest of Dawood.
Mumbai police raided the premises of Dagdi Chawl several times and finally broke Gawli&#x27;s underworld operations. Gawli was arrested several times for criminal activities and was detained for long periods during the trial. However, he could not be convicted in most of the cases as witnesses would not depose against him for fear of retaliation. He was finally convicted of the murder of Shiv Sena leader Kamlakar Jamsandekar by a court in August 2012. Gawli and eleven others were found guilty of Jamsandekar&#x27;s murder and Gawali was sentenced to life imprisonment. Charge sheet of 138 pages were furnished by IPS Jayanthi Naidu - Joint Director Central Bureau of Investigation, 2002 Batch Officer.

==Politics==
Gawli got political patronage in the 1980s, when the then Shiv Sena chief, Bal Thackeray, criticised the Mumbai police for taking stringent action against Hindu gangsters like Arun Gawli and Sai Bansod, referring to them as &quot;amchi mulgey&quot; (our boys). Thackeray was challenged by a rival gangster in an open letter carried on the front page of a city tabloid. However, Gawli fell out with Shiv Sena in the mid-1990s, murdered Shiv Sena men and formed his own political party, the Akhil Bharatiya Sena.

In 2004, Gawli was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) from the Mumbai Chinchpokli constituency as an Akhil Bharatiya Sena candidate. Gawli&#x27;s rise in prominence is believed to be due to his &quot;native roots&quot; as a local lad, which makes him distinct from most other non-Marathi-speaking politicians.

Gawli&#x27;s political designs suffered a major blow when his nephew and party legislator, Sachin Ahir, came out openly against him and joined Sharad Pawar&#x27;s Nationalist Congress Party. Ahir even contested against Gawli in the subsequent Lok Sabha elections on a Nationalist Congress Party ticket, resulting in defeat for them both, but a victory for the Shiv Sena&#x27;s sitting MP Mohan Rawale. Gawli&#x27;s daughter Geeta was an ex a corporator to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.

==In popular culture==
*In the 2015 Marathi movie &quot;Dagadi Chawl&quot;, Makarand Deshpande&#x27;s character called &quot;Daddy&quot; is mainly based on Arun Gawli&#x27;s life. Ankush Chaudhari played the lead and as Arun Gawli&#x27;s lieutenant.
*The Hindi film &quot;Daddy&quot; was released on 8 September 2017 and is based on Gawli&#x27;s life, starring Arjun Rampal in and as Daddy.
* In the Netflix series &quot;Sacred Games&quot;, based on novel by Vikram Chandra, the lead character Ganesh Gaitonde is loosely based on Arun Gawli.

<text>An infomorph is a virtual body of information that possesses self-awareness and sentience. The term was coined in Charles Platt&#x27;s 1991 novel &quot;The Silicon Man&quot;, where it refers to a single biological consciousness transferred into a computer through a process of mind transfer. In the book, a character defines an infomorph as &quot;intelligence held in a computer memory&quot;, and an &quot;information entity&quot;.

In the 2002 game Transhuman Space, an infomorph is any form of sentient or near-sentient computer program, which may exist either only in the computer networks or occupy a physical body: robot, android, a living thing (&quot;wetware&quot;, &quot;bioshell&quot;). They may be of two main types: mind emulations (mind-uploaded human intelligencies) and &quot;native&quot; artificial intelligencies. These types are further classified into subtypes.

In EVE Online, players are posthuman entities known as capsuleers: immortal spacecraft commanders who can cheat death by scanning and transferring their consciousness into remote clones. &quot;Infomorph Psychology&quot; and &quot;Advanced Infomorph Psychology&quot; are neural enhancement skills for pilots using &quot;jump clones&quot; to alleviate the unsettling effect of the detaching of one&#x27;s consciousness and transferring it into a remote clone.

<text>Brindleyplace is a large mixed-use canalside development, in the Westside district of Birmingham, England. It was named after Brindley Place, the name of the street (in turn named after the 18th-century canal engineer James Brindley) around which it is built. It was developed by the Argent Group from 1993 onwards.

In addition to shops, bars and restaurants, Brindleyplace is home to the National Sea Life Centre, Royal Bank of Scotland, Orion Media, Ikon Gallery of art and the Crescent Theatre. The site covers 17 acres (69,000 m²) of mixed-use redevelopment - the UK&#x27;s largest such project. The Birmingham Canal Navigations Main Line Canal separates Brindleyplace from the International Convention Centre, although there are linking bridges. The National Indoor Arena, Old Turn Junction and bars of Broad Street are nearby and it is easily accessible and within walking distance of the main bus, metro (tram) and rail routes.

==History==

The area occupied by Brindleyplace was, at the height of Birmingham&#x27;s industrial past, the site of factories, however, by the 1970s as Britain&#x27;s manufacturing went into decline, the factories closed down and the buildings lay derelict for many years.

Birmingham City Council&#x27;s aim was to create an environment of water features, walkways and new office and leisure buildings, that would open out onto the adjacent canal. The scheme was assembled by the council in the 1980s. The council were also seeing success with the construction of the International Convention Centre with the Symphony Hall, and the National Indoor Arena. A development brief was drawn up, identifying the site as an area to attract people to complement the convention centre.

Initial proposals were drawn up by Merlin, who teamed with developers Shearwater. However, Merlin pulled out of the scheme and were replaced by Rosehaugh. Rosehaugh had paid £26 million for the site in 1990. Rosehaugh revised Merlin&#x27;s retail-led scheme to include more office space and a residential element. By 1992, a detailed set of proposals which included retail and restaurants with a central square had been agreed. However, Rosehaugh went into receivership by the end of the year. Argent took over the scheme, paying £3 million to the receivers. Argent slightly amended the plans by separating the residential element from the rest of the scheme and commencing construction of the Water&#x27;s Edge first, along with an office building.

By 1995, when Argent refinanced the scheme, the land value was back over £25 million. The Water&#x27;s Edge was trading successfully and the housing element, Symphony Court, had sold all of its units. The price for the average family house in the scheme was over £200,000. Short term finance was supplied by Hypobank.

==Buildings==

A variety of architects were used to design the buildings in the complex to create a range of architectural styles. The masterplan was designed by Terry Farrell. Buildings One, Two, Four and Six Brindleyplace together with the Hilton Garden Inn were all built by Carillion, as was the conversion of the Ikon Gallery from a Victorian school.

All the buildings are low-rise, with the tallest being Eleven Brindleyplace completed in 2009 at , and the second-tallest is Three Brindleyplace at . Eight Brindleyplace is the third-tallest with a height of , although it has more floors than Three Brindleyplace.

The value of the residences increased 250% in the first few years.

==Squares==
Brindleyplace consists of three public squares: Central Square, Oozells Square and Brunswick Square. 

===Central Square===

Central Square consists of a tree-lined area which is able to accommodate open-air performing arts events, such as ArtsFest which is held there annually. The square is paved in York stone and has a fountain featuring 38 jets of water.

Situated in the centre of the square is a Costa Coffee designed by Piers Gough. Constructed of glass and steel, it has an &quot;eye-shaped&quot; footprint. The structure consists of a tubular steel frame which is glazed. The vertical structural columns meet the roof members which cross over at a ridge. This forms two canopies which mirror the footprint of the building. Forty people can be seated in the by café, with 100 also able to sit outside. The glazing consists of double glazed units with a white dot fritted outer pane. This reduces glare and solar gain.

Also in the square is a sculpture named &quot;Aquaduct&quot; by Miles Davies. Made of bronze and phosphor, the sculpture was the winning entry in a competition conducted by Brindleyplace plc in conjunction with the Royal Society of British Sculptors. &quot;Aquaduct&quot; was the first of Davies&#x27; winning pieces to be unveiled in August 1995. Situated on a low stepped base, the sculpture is in two pieces and is in the form of an aqueduct. It is illuminated at night by recessed lighting. It was manufactured by Burleighfield Arts and supported by the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts (ABSA). The sculpture is tall, long and wide. The second work by Miles Davies in the Brindleyplace scheme is &quot;Gates&quot;, which is a tall, long and wide, bronze and phosphor sculpture taking the shape of traditional lock gates on canals. Like &quot;Aquaduct&quot;, it is a hollow construction.

===Oozells Square===
Oozells Square, receiving its name from Oozells Street that ran on the site before the development, features a channel of still water running diagonally which is lined by cherry trees. Paul de Monchaux designed the stone sculptured seats and the pergola which are located in the square. The main entrance to the Ikon Gallery overlooks the square.

===Brunswick Square===
Brunswick Square is located to the west of the development. Whilst being a pedestrian-zone, it has vehicular access. It is overlooked by the Hilton Garden Inn and forms the main entrance to Eleven Brindleyplace.

==Ownership and management==
When the scheme was opened, Argent believed that if the development was broken up and sold off separately, the public realm would be neglected. They took it upon themselves to manage the site in conjunction with GVA, who also have offices at Three Brindleyplace. The annual budget for the management and maintenance of the public realm at Brindleyplace was £890,000, with the overall budget for the entire scheme being £4 million. Over 70 staff help maintain Brindleyplace.

The Brindleyplace estate was acquired from Brindleyplace Limited Partnership in 2010 for £190 million by Hines UK on behalf of Hines Global REIT in a joint venture with Moorfield Group. The asset is now managed by Hines and Moorfield Group. The buildings included in the deal were Three to Six and Nine Brindleyplace, Costa Coffee, Ikon Gallery, Crescent Theatre and the multi-storey car park.

One Brindleyplace is owned by Trinova Real Estate.

==Transport==
An extension of the West Midlands Metro to Edgbaston opened in July 2022 with a stop at Brindleyplace. In the future, more lines out to Birmingham Airport, Bearwood and Walsall are planned to pass through the area.

<doc id="621439" wikidata="Q425625" url="?curid=621439" title="Down on the Upside">
<text>Down on the Upside is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Soundgarden, released on May 21, 1996, through A&amp;M Records. Following a worldwide tour in support of its previous album, &quot;Superunknown&quot; (1994), Soundgarden commenced work on a new album. Self-produced by the band, the music on the album was notably less heavy and dark than the group&#x27;s preceding albums and featured the band experimenting with new sounds.

The album topped the New Zealand and Australian charts and debuted at number two on the United States&#x27; &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 200,000 copies in its opening week and spawning the singles &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot;, &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;, and &quot;Ty Cobb&quot;. The band played the 1996 Lollapalooza tour and, afterward, supported the album with a worldwide tour.

&quot;Down on the Upside&quot; was Soundgarden&#x27;s last studio album until 2012&#x27;s &quot;King Animal&quot;, as tensions within the band led to its break-up in April 1997. The album has sold 1.6 million copies in the United States.

==Recording==
Recording sessions for the album took place between November 1995 and February 1996 at Studio Litho and Bad Animals Studios in Seattle, Washington. Studio Litho is owned by Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard. The members of Soundgarden produced the album themselves. On the choice of not working with a producer, frontman Chris Cornell said that &quot;a fifth guy is too many cooks and convolutes everything. It has to go down too many mental roads, which dilutes it.&quot; Drummer Matt Cameron added that, while working with Michael Beinhorn on &quot;Superunknown&quot; had good results, it was &quot;a little more of a struggle than it needed to be&quot;, and self-production would make the process go faster. Adam Kasper, who previously had worked with Soundgarden as an assistant engineer on &quot;Superunknown&quot;, worked with the band as a production collaborator and mixed the album.

Work on the album began in July 1995. The band took a break to perform at festivals in Europe, where new material was road-tested. Afterward, the band did more songwriting for about a month and then recorded most of the album at Studio Litho. The overall approach to songwriting was less collaborative than with past efforts, with the individual band members having brought in most of the songs more completely written. The band sought to try things it had not done before and to use a greater variety of material. They tried to create a live atmosphere for the album, and looked to leave in sounds that producers would normally try to clean up, such as feedback and out-of-tune guitar parts. The overall time spent working on the album was less than what the band had spent working on &quot;Superunknown&quot;. Cornell described the album-making process as &quot;way faster and way easier&quot;.

Most of the material was written by Cornell and bassist Ben Shepherd, the latter having already worked on six of the sixteen album tracks. Reportedly, tensions within the group arose during the recording sessions, with guitarist Kim Thayil and Cornell allegedly clashing over Cornell&#x27;s desire to shift away from the heavy guitar riffing that had become the band&#x27;s trademark. Thayil&#x27;s only contribution to the album was the song &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot;, for which he wrote both the lyrics and the music, and which was also the last song the band recorded. The song initially came out of a jam session Thayil had with Seattle musician Greg Gilmore. In the liner notes, Thayil credits Gilmore for inspiring the song. He stated that he had a lot of incomplete music ideas that were missing lyrics and were not arranged, so they did not make the album. Thayil said: &quot;It can be a little bit discouraging if there isn&#x27;t satisfactory creative input, but on the other hand, I write all the solo bits and don&#x27;t really have limitations on the parts I come up with for guitar.&quot; Cornell said: &quot;By the time we were finished, it felt like it had been kind of hard, like it was a long, hard haul. But there was stuff we were discovering.&quot;

==Music and lyrics==

The album&#x27;s songs placed emphasis on vocals and melody over the heavy guitar riffs that were found on the band&#x27;s earlier LPs. It also features a rawer sound than Soundgarden&#x27;s previous album &quot;Superunknown&quot;, as the band members produced the record themselves. Cornell summed up the changes by saying: &quot;What we&#x27;ve lost in sonic precision we&#x27;ve gained so much in terms of feeling.&quot; Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said Soundgarden &quot;retained their ambitious song structures, neo-psychedelic guitar textures, and winding melodies but haven&#x27;t dressed them up with detailed production.&quot; The songs vary in tempo throughout the course of the album, with Thayil describing the album as having a &quot;dual nature&quot;. He stated, &quot;It keeps listeners on their toes and lets them know they&#x27;re not getting the same album over and over.&quot; Shepherd called the album &quot;the most accurate picture of what Soundgarden actually sounds like&quot;, stating: &quot;It&#x27;s way more raw. It&#x27;s way more honest. It&#x27;s way more &#x27;responsible.&#x27;&quot;

The band stated at the time that it wanted to experiment with other sounds, which included Shepherd and Cornell playing mandolin and mandola in the song &quot;Ty Cobb&quot;. This experimentation can be heard to a lesser degree on &quot;Superunknown&quot;. Soundgarden used alternative tunings and odd time signatures on several of the album&#x27;s songs. For example, &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot; uses a time signature of 9/8. &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; and &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; were written in C-G-C-G-G-E tuning.

The overall mood of the album&#x27;s lyrics is not as dark as on previous Soundgarden albums. Cornell even admitted &quot;Dusty&quot; was &quot;pretty positive for a Soundgarden song&quot;, describing it as an opposite to the previous album&#x27;s &quot;Fell On Black Days&quot;. According to Cornell, &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; is about &quot;an attractively packaged bad idea&quot;, and &quot;Ty Cobb&quot; is about a &quot;hardcore pissed-off idiot&quot;. Cornell said the songs &quot;Never Named&quot; and &quot;Boot Camp&quot; are based on his childhood. Thayil said the lyrics for &quot;Never the Machine Forever&quot; are about &quot;a life-and-death match between an individual and a less specifically defined entity&quot;. Cornell referred to &quot;Overfloater&quot; as &quot;self-affirming&quot;.

==Packaging==
The album&#x27;s cover art, photographed by Kevin Westenberg, features the members of the band in silhouette. Reportedly, at one point the photo of caterpillars eating a tomato that was used for the &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot; single was considered for use as the cover of &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;. The album was also released in a limited edition with the &quot;Into the Upside&quot; interview disc.

The title &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; comes from a line in the song &quot;Dusty&quot;. The lyric is &quot;I think it&#x27;s turning back on me/I&#x27;m down on the upside&quot;. Cornell said the title represents the different feels on the album. In an interview, he explained how the name was chosen:

&quot;I brought it up at some point because the song that the title came from was &#x27;Dusty&#x27;, but my title for it was &#x27;Down on the Upside&#x27;, but Ben wrote the music and he called it &#x27;Dusty&#x27;. So since we don&#x27;t really like having song titles being the title of the record, &#x27;cause it brings this weird, undue focus to the song, I thought it would be cool to call it &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;. We started thinking about all these other titles, and worrying about them describing the whole record without excluding anything ... So it was the last minute and we were at a photo shoot for &quot;Spin&quot; and someone called and said, &#x27;We need your title now so we can start doing the record package,&#x27; so Matt [Cameron] brought up the title again, and everyone went, &#x27;yeah, that&#x27;s it.&#x27;&quot;

In an interview given by the band, Cameron and Shepherd jokingly said that two other titles considered for the album were &quot;Mr. Bunchy Pants&quot; and &quot;Comin&#x27; At Ya!&quot;

==Release and reception==

&quot;Down on the Upside&quot; had a 10,000-copy limited edition vinyl release on May 14, 1996, one week prior to its main release on CD and cassette. It debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart with 175,500 units sold, behind only &quot;The Score&quot; by the Fugees. The album has gone on to sell 1.6 million copies in the United States, and has been certified Platinum by the RIAA.

Ivan Kreilkamp of &quot;Spin&quot; gave the album an eight out of ten, saying the album is &quot;as sprawling and generous-spirited as &quot;Superunknown&quot;, but ... is a looser and live-er-sounding affair, not seeking the same level of aural precision&quot;. &quot;Alternative Press&quot; gave the album a three out of five, saying Soundgarden are &quot;now fully capable of penning some damned spiffy pop songs&quot;, and adding that &quot;they sound more human here, like they&#x27;re playing in your living room&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; staff writer David Fricke gave &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; three out of five stars, observing that the album has &quot;some quality frenzy&quot;, but criticizing it for &quot;lack[ing] defining episodes of catharsis&quot;, and saying: &quot;Soundgarden seem to be digging in their heels rather than kicking up dirt, relying too much on drone-y impressionism and clever (as opposed to cleaving) guitar motifs.&quot; Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the album the &quot;rawer, looser follow-up to &quot;Superunknown&quot;&quot;, adding: &quot;Generally, identifying with animals in song lyrics is a sign of low self-esteem, and Soundgarden is no exception. For all the virility and macho power that rock singers have tried to wring from the [snake], Soundgarden remains more interested in the fact that it is the only animal cursed to spend its days slithering on the ground.&quot;

David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a B+, saying: &quot;Few bands since Led Zeppelin have so crisply mixed instruments both acoustic and electric.&quot; He praised several songs as being &quot;as powerful as anything the band has done&quot;, but criticized the album&#x27;s production, saying that, &quot;like many self-produced efforts, it shows.&quot; He added: &quot;With arrangements that crest and fall to the point where a road map would have helped, the overlong (16-song) album is often unwieldy and could have benefited from judicious trimming.&quot; AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album three out of five stars, saying that &quot;it might seem like nothing more than heavy metal, but a closer listen reveals that Soundgarden haven&#x27;t tempered their ambitions at all.&quot; The reviewer for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; said that &quot;their roots don&#x27;t matter now. All I care for now is the immediacy of their pop moments.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an honorable mention of one star, describing it as &quot;brutal depression simplified&quot; and highlighted by the songs &quot;Ty Cobb&quot; and &quot;Applebite&quot;, while Jason Josephes from &quot;Pitchfork&quot; called it a &quot;double shot of grunge, no foam but plenty of caffeine.&quot; A negative review came from Johnny Cigarettes of &quot;NME&quot;, who gave the album 3/10 and said: &quot;Throughout this record the mood of dark, demon-wrestling introspection continually rings hollow ... the lack of gut-level resonance [Soundgarden] create reveals all this as mere dark stylistics, the modern equivalent of a scary monster on an Iron Maiden T-shirt.&quot;

The album included the singles &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot;, and &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;, all of which had accompanying music videos. All three singles placed on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock charts. The album&#x27;s other commercially released single, &quot;Ty Cobb&quot;, did not chart, however its acommpanying B-side, &quot;Rhinosaur&quot;, also from the album, did chart. &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; was the most successful song from &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; on the rock charts, spending a total of five weeks at number one on the Mainstream Rock charts and reaching number two on the Modern Rock charts. At the 1997 Grammy Awards, &quot;Pretty Noose&quot; received a nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.

==Tour==
The band played the 1996 Lollapalooza tour with Metallica, who had insisted on Soundgarden&#x27;s appearance on the tour. Thayil said the band wasn&#x27;t interested in doing the tour until it became a &quot;Metallica tour&quot;. During the Lollapalooza tour, the band members reportedly took separate flights and then met at the gigs.

After Lollapalooza, the band embarked on a worldwide tour, supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and, when asked if the band hated touring, Cornell said: &quot;We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like the first time you ever played them. That&#x27;s the point where we hate touring.&quot; The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that &quot;after a number of years, you start to feel like you&#x27;re acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while.&quot; Thayil had an issue with how the band&#x27;s audience had changed, stating that &quot;nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, &#x27;Thanks for the money.&#x27; And they say, &#x27;Thanks for the song.&#x27;&quot; The band&#x27;s concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell&#x27;s throat problems.

At the final stop of the tour, in Honolulu, Hawaii, on February 9, 1997, Shepherd threw his bass into the air in frustration after suffering equipment failure, and subsequently stormed off the stage. The band retreated, and Cornell returned alone to conclude the show with a solo encore. On April 9, 1997, the band announced its disbanding. Thayil said, &quot;It was pretty obvious from everybody&#x27;s general attitude over the course of the previous half year that there was some dissatisfaction.&quot; Cameron later said that Soundgarden was &quot;eaten up by the business&quot;.

==Track listing==
==Outtakes==
Various versions of the &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot; single featured two B-sides from the &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; recording sessions that were not included on the album: &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Bleed Together&quot;. &quot;Bleed Together&quot; was included on the band&#x27;s 1997 greatest hits compilation, &quot;A-Sides&quot;, and was released as a promo CD single in 1997. Thayil said the song was not included on &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; because the band was not pleased with the mixing that was done on the song and the band already had enough songs for the album.

Another song that was written and recorded for the album is &quot;Kristi&quot;, which Cameron has said is one of his favorite Soundgarden songs. &quot;Kristi&quot; was finally mixed in 2014 and included on the compilation &quot;Echo of Miles: Scattered Tracks Across the Path&quot;, along with both &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Bleed Together&quot;.

<text>Sankt Anton am Arlberg, commonly referred to as St Anton, is a village and ski resort in the Austrian state of Tyrol. It lies in the Tyrolean Alps, with aerial tramways and chairlifts up to , yielding a vertical drop of . It is also a popular summer resort among trekkers and mountaineers.

Skiing has a long history in St. Anton: ski instructors from the area emigrated to the United States in the 1930s, helping to popularise the sport. St. Anton was the host of the Alpine World Ski Championships in 2001, and is frequently listed as one of the world&#x27;s top skiing resorts both in terms of skiing available and après-ski entertainment.

== Geography ==

St Anton lies on the Rosanna River and is in the main east-west rail line between Austria and Switzerland. There are many airports that serve St Anton by way of train and car that include Munich, Zürich, Innsbruck, and Friedrichshafen. The centre is a pedestrian zone.

== Activities ==

=== Skiing ===

St Anton is part of the Arlberg area of ski resorts – a region that includes 94 cable cars and ski lifts, of groomed pistes and of deep-snow runs, all of which are covered under one liftpass.

On the western edge of village is the &quot;Galzigbahn&quot; which has been replaced by a Funitel gondola. The new gondola includes a first-ever &quot;Ferris wheel&quot;: enabling passengers to board the gondolas on ground level, then rotating the gondolas up to the main high-speed cables. The Funitel accesses the Galzig slopes and connects to Schindler and Valluga peaks. On the eastern edge of town, the &quot;Nassereinbahn&quot; rises to the Nasserein area with connections to the Kapall peak. The Kapall, Valluga, and Schindler peaks provide skiers with close to 1,500 vertical metres skiing (). Slope-side après-ski bars can be found on the Steissbachtal trail just above St Anton.

The groomed runs in the region cater to all levels; 43% are for beginners (blue), 41% for intermediate skiers (red) and 16% are for the more advanced (black). There are also of deep snow runs in the area.

Expert terrain includes less-frequently groomed ski routes such as Schindlerkar and Mattun, and the backside of Valluga () down to Zürs, which is for experts only if accompanied by a guide. There are also a large number of off-piste routes in the area that experts can explore with the help of a guide.

Other ski areas are St Christoph am Arlberg, a hamlet where in the 14th century the shepherd Heinrich Findelkind built a hospice as a shelter for travellers crossing the Arlberg pass to the Vorarlberg province, Stuben, Lech, Zürs, Warth-Schröcken and Klösterle/Sonnenkopf.

== Transportation ==
=== Road ===

St Anton is easily reached by car on the A14 motorway, which runs from Vorarlberg (Austria&#x27;s westernmost state, which borders Liechtenstein and Switzerland) and then follows the spine of the Tyrol. 

Alternatively, St Anton, Langen am Arlberg, and Kloesterle (all located in the Arlberg ski region) have railway stations. Both St Anton and Langen am Arlberg are stops on international train services between Zurich and Budapest.

St Anton and the surrounding villages/resorts are served by a network of bus routes. In the town itself, there are two hubs known as the &quot;Terminal Ost&quot; and the &quot;Terminal West&quot;. &quot;Terminal Ost&quot; gives access to the Nassereinbahn Gondola and the &quot;Terminal West&quot; to the Galzigbahn/ Rendlbahn gondolas as well as the town&#x27;s railway station. 

There is a route with frequent, year-round services between St Anton and Landeck, the latter being a town located at the entrance to the main valley (Stanzertal, as it is known in the local area). Frequent free bus services also operate between different parts of St Anton as well as from Pettneu, Schnann, and Flirsch.

=== Rail ===
 is a railway station on the Arlberg railway line between and Innsbruck Hauptbahnhof. The station is served by RailJet, EuroCity, InterCity, EuroNight and NightJet trains of Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB) and services of WESTbahn.

==Climate==

== In popular culture ==

The resort was featured extensively in the 2011 film &quot;Chalet Girl&quot;, a romantic comedy starring Felicity Jones, Ed Westwick and Bill Nighy. The resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen in Germany was also used for some interior shots.

Was the site used for the 1995 music video “Light Years” for Jamiroquai’s fourth single from their sophomore album “The Return Of The Space Cowboy”. 

St. Anton was shown in the 1969 film &quot;Downhill Racer&quot;, starring Robert Redford and Gene Hackman.

St. Anton was also the setting for the film &quot;The White Ecstasy&quot;, starring Leni Riefenstahl and local ski instructor Hannes Schneider. Made in 1931, the comedy film was a fictional account of the skiing exploits of a young village girl, played by Riefenstahl, and her attempts to master the sport of skiing and ski-jumping aided by the local ski expert Hannes Schneider. The film was one of the first to use and develop outdoor film-making techniques and featured several innovative action-skiing scenes. Riefenstahl went on to make Nazi propaganda films and, post-war, subsequently lived in Africa. After the war, Schneider developed the downhill skiing method known as the &quot;Arlberg technique&quot;.

<text>The Lady Lever Art Gallery is a museum founded and built by the industrialist and philanthropist William Lever, 1st Viscount Leverhulme and opened in 1922. The Lady Lever Art Gallery is set in the garden village of Port Sunlight, on the Wirral and one of the National Museums Liverpool.

The museum is a significant surviving example of late Victorian and Edwardian taste. It houses major collections of fine and decorative art that are an expression of Lord Leverhulme&#x27;s personal taste and collecting interests. The collection is strong in British 19th-century painting and sculpture, spilling over to include late 18th-century and early 20th works. There are important collections of English furniture, Wedgwood, especially jasperware, and Chinese ceramics, and smaller groups of other types of objects, such as Ancient Greek vases and Roman sculpture. The majority of objects were part of the original donation, but the collection has continued to expand at a modest rate. The museum displays mostly mixed paintings, sculpture and furniture together, and there are five period rooms recreating typical period interiors from large houses.

==History==
Lever began collecting art in the late 19th century, largely to use in advertising for the popular Sunlight Soap brand (manufactured a few minutes&#x27; walk from the gallery) that helped to create his fortune. As he grew richer his collections began to expand, his confidence grew as well and he developed a taste for collecting. He mostly collected British art, but he was also fascinated by Chinese art, Roman sculpture and Greek vases, which he had chosen to collect to show styles that had influenced British artists in the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries.

He endowed the gallery to showcase his collection. It is named in memory of his wife Elizabeth Hulme (Lady Lever) who had died in 1913.

==The building==
Commissioned in 1913 from architects William and Segar Owen, the &quot;Lady Lever Art Gallery&quot; was built in the Beaux-Arts style. The building was opened in 1922 by Princess Beatrice, the youngest daughter of Queen Victoria.

In 2015 a touring exhibition visited museums in Japan and elsewhere. The redeveloped South End galleries were restored to their original architecture style as part of a £2.8 million restoration project in 2016. The work included opening up original doorways to increase the circulation of visitors, improving the lighting and restoring some of the original vaulted ceilings.

==Collection==
The Gallery has good representation of several trends in Victorian painting, including the Pre-Raphaelites, both during the period of the Brotherhood and in their subsequent careers. Concern with social conditions, classical revivalism and later historical painting are all represented. There are important works by Millais, Ford Madox Brown, William Holman Hunt, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Edward Burne-Jones, Lord Leighton, and many others. The museum has what appears to be the largest display in any museum of paintings by William Etty. Earlier works include those by Turner, Constable, Gainsborough and Reynolds.

Much of the Wedgwood collection was from the collection of Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth, bought in 1905. This in turn was partly formed from the collection of Charles Darwin, Josiah Wedgwood&#x27;s grandson. It is probably the best collection of jasperware in the world.

The collection includes several examples of New Sculpture including works by Edward Onslow Ford, John Gibson, William Goscombe John, and F. W. Pomeroy.

<text>Thomas Say (June 27, 1787 – October 10, 1834) was an American entomologist, conchologist, and herpetologist. His studies of insects and shells, numerous contributions to scientific journals, and scientific expeditions to Florida, Georgia, the Rocky Mountains, Mexico, and elsewhere made him an internationally known naturalist. Say has been called the father of American descriptive entomology and American conchology. He served as librarian for the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, curator at the American Philosophical Society (elected in 1817), and professor of natural history at the University of Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Born in Philadelphia into a prominent Quaker family, Thomas Say was the great-grandson of John Bartram, and the great-nephew of William Bartram. His father, Dr. Benjamin Say, was brother-in-law to another Bartram son, Moses Bartram. The Say family had a house, &quot;The Cliffs&quot; at Gray&#x27;s Ferry, adjoining the Bartram family farms in Kingessing township, Philadelphia County. As a boy, Say often visited the family garden, Bartram&#x27;s Garden, where he frequently took butterfly and beetle specimens to his great-uncle William.

==Career==
Say trained to be an apothecary. A self-taught naturalist, Say helped found the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia (ANSP) in 1812. In 1816, he met Charles Alexandre Lesueur, a French naturalist, malacologist, and ichthyologist who soon became a member of the Academy and served as its curator until 1824.

At the Academy, Say began his work on what he would publish as &quot;American Entomology&quot;. To collect insects, he made numerous expeditions to frontier areas, risking American Indian attacks and hazards of traveling in wild countryside. In 1818, Say accompanied his friend William Maclure, then the ANSP president and father of American geology; Gerhard Troost, a geologist; and other members of the Academy on a geological expedition to the off-shore islands of Georgia and Florida, then a Spanish colony.

In 1819–20, Major Stephen Harriman Long led an exploration to the Rocky Mountains and the tributaries of the Missouri River, with Say as zoologist. Their official account of this expedition included the first descriptions of the coyote, swift fox, western kingbird, band-tailed pigeon, rock wren, Say&#x27;s phoebe, lesser goldfinch, lark sparrow, lazuli bunting, orange-crowned warbler, checkered whiptail lizard, collared lizard, ground skink, western rat snake, and western ribbon snake.
In 1823, Say served as chief zoologist in Long&#x27;s expedition to the headwaters of the Mississippi River. He traveled on the &quot;Boatload of Knowledge&quot; to the New Harmony Settlement in Indiana (1826–34), a utopian society experiment founded by Robert Owen. Say was accompanied by Maclure, Lesueur, Troost, and Francis Neef, an innovative pedagogue. There he later met Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz, another naturalist.

On January 4, 1827, Say secretly married Lucy Way Sistare, whom he had met as one of the passengers to New Harmony, near the settlement. She was an artist and illustrator of specimens, as in the book &quot;American Conchology&quot;, and was elected as the first woman member of the Academy of Natural Sciences.

At New Harmony, Thomas Say carried on his monumental work describing insects and mollusks, leading to two classic works:
*&quot;American Entomology, or Descriptions of the Insects of North America&quot;, 3 volumes, Philadelphia, 1824–1828.
*&quot;American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America Illustrated From Coloured Figures From Original Drawings Executed from Nature&quot;, Parts 1–6, New Harmony, 1830–1834; Part 7, Philadelphia, 1836.

Many of the scientific names assigned by Say are no longer accepted. Lists of the former names matched with current scientific and common names are available.

During their years in New Harmony, Say and Lesueur experienced considerable difficulties. Say was a modest and unassuming man, who lived frugally like a hermit. He abandoned commercial activities and devoted himself to his studies, making difficulties for his family.

Say died, apparently from typhoid fever, in New Harmony on 10 October 1834, when he was 47 years old.

==Legacy and honors==
Say described more than 1,000 new species of beetles, more than 400 species of insects of other orders, and seven well-known species of snakes.

Other zoologists honored him by naming several taxa after him:
*&quot;Dyspanopeus sayi&quot; – Say&#x27;s mud crab
*&quot;Portunus sayi&quot; – a swimming crab of the family Portunidae
*&quot;Porcellana sayana&quot; – an Atlantic porcelain crab
*&quot;Lanceola sayana&quot; – an amphipod from the family Lanceolidae
*&quot;Calliostoma sayanum&quot; – a sea snail in the family Calliostomatidae
*&quot;Diodora sayi&quot; – a sea snail in the family Fissurellidae
*&quot;Oliva sayana&quot; – a sea snail in the family Olividae
*&quot;Sayella&quot; – a genus of sea snails in the family Pyramidellidae
*&quot;Propeamussium sayanum&quot; – a saltwater clam in the family Propeamussiidae
*&quot;Appalachina sayana&quot; – a land snail in the family Polygyridae
*&quot;Pituophis catenifer sayi&quot; – the bullsnake
*&quot;Sayornis&quot; – a genus in the tyrant flycatcher family
*&quot;Sciurus niger rufiventer&quot; - Say&#x27;s squirrel
*&quot;Chlorochroa sayi&quot; - Say&#x27;s stink bug, a species of stink bug

<text>The Punic language, also called Phoenicio-Punic or Carthaginian, is an extinct variety of the Phoenician language, a Canaanite language of the Northwest Semitic branch of the Semitic languages. An offshoot of the Phoenician language of coastal West Asia (modern Lebanon and north western Syria), it was principally spoken on the Mediterranean coast of Northwest Africa, the Iberian Peninsula and several Mediterranean islands, such as Malta, Sicily, and Sardinia by the Punic people, or western Phoenicians, throughout classical antiquity, from the 8th century BC to the 6th century AD.

==History==
===Early history===
Punic is considered to have gradually separated from its Phoenician parent around the time that Carthage became the leading Phoenician city under Mago I, but scholarly attempts to delineate the dialects lack precision and generally disagree on the classification.

The Punics stayed in contact with the homeland of Phoenicia until the destruction of Carthage by the Roman Republic in 146 BC. At first, there was not much difference between Phoenician and Punic. Developments in the language before 146 BC are largely hidden from us by the adherence of Carthaginian scribes to a traditional Phoenician orthography, but there are occasional hints that the phonology and grammar of Punic had begun to diverge from Phoenician after the sixth century BC. The clearest evidence for this comes from Motya in western Sicily, but there are also traces of it in sixth-century Carthaginian inscriptions and it is unclear whether these developments began in western Sicily and spread to Africa or vice versa. From the fifth-century BC, a shared set of alphabetic, orthographic, and phonological rules are encountered in Punic inscriptions throughout the western Mediterranean, probably due to Carthaginian influence.

Punic literary works were written in the period before 146 BC. For example, Mago wrote 28 volumes about animal husbandry. The Roman Senate appreciated the works so much that after taking Carthage, they presented them to Berber princes who owned libraries there. Mago&#x27;s work was translated into Greek by Cassius Dionysius of Utica. A Latin version was probably translated from the Greek version. Further examples of Punic works of literature include the works of Hanno the Navigator, who wrote about his encounters during his naval voyages around what is today Africa and about the settling of new colonies in Iberia, North Africa, and the Mediterranean.

===Neo-Punic===
Neo-Punic refers to the dialect of Punic spoken after the fall of Carthage and after the Roman conquest of the former Punic territories in 146 BC. The dialect differed from the earlier Punic language, as is evident from divergent spelling compared to earlier Punic and by the use of non-Semitic names, mostly of Libyco-Berber or Iberian origin. The difference was due to the dialectal changes that Punic underwent as it spread among the northern Berber peoples. Sallust (86 – 34 BC) claims Punic was &quot;altered by their intermarriages with the Numidians&quot;. That account agrees with other evidence found to suggest a North African Berber influence on Punic, such as Libyco-Berber names in the &quot;Onomasticon&quot; of Eusebius. Neo-Punic is mostly known from inscriptions, including &quot;Lepcis Magna N 19&quot; (= &quot;KAI&quot; 124; 92 AD).

Around the fourth century AD, Punic was still spoken in what is now northern parts of Tunisia and Algeria, other parts of Northwest Africa, and the Mediterranean. A version of Punic, known as &quot;Latino-Punic&quot; was written in the Latin alphabet and is known from seventy texts. These texts include the 1st-century &quot;Zliten LP1&quot; and the second century &quot;Lepcis Magna LP1&quot;. They were even written as late as the 4th century, &quot;Bir ed-Dreder LP2&quot;. Augustine of Hippo (d. 430) is generally considered the last major ancient writer to have some knowledge of Punic and is considered the &quot;primary source on the survival of [late] Punic&quot;. According to him, Punic was still spoken in his region (Northern Africa) in the 5th century, centuries after the fall of Carthage, and there were still people who called themselves &quot;chanani&quot; (&quot;Canaanite&quot;) at that time. He wrote around 401:

Besides Augustine, the only proof of Punic-speaking communities at such a late period is a series of trilingual funerary texts found in the Christian catacombs of Sirte, Libya: the gravestones are carved in Ancient Greek, Latin and Punic. It might have even survived the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb, as the geographer al-Bakri describes a people speaking a language that was not Berber, Latin or Coptic in Sirte, where spoken Punic survived well past written use. However, it is likely that Arabization of Punic speakers was facilitated by their language belonging to the same group (both were Semitic languages) as that of the conquerors and so they had many grammatical and lexical similarities.

===Legacy===
The idea that Punic was the origin of Maltese was first raised in 1565. Modern linguistics has proved that Maltese is in fact derived from Arabic, probably Siculo-Arabic specifically, with a large number of loanwords from Italian. However, Punic was indeed spoken on the island of Malta at some point in its history, as evidenced by both the Cippi of Melqart, which is integral to the decipherment of Punic after its extinction, and other inscriptions that were found on the islands. Punic itself, being Canaanite, was more similar to Modern Hebrew than to Arabic.

Today there are a number of common Berber roots that descend from Punic, including the word for &quot;learn&quot; (&quot;*almid&quot;, &quot;*yulmad&quot;; compare Hebrew ).

==Description==
Punic is known from inscriptions (most of them religious formulae) and personal name evidence. The play &quot;Poenulus&quot; by Plautus contains a few lines of vernacular Punic which have been subject to some research because unlike inscriptions, they largely preserve the vowels.

Like its Phoenician parent, Punic was written from right to left, in horizontal lines, without vowels.

==Phonology==
Punic has 22 consonants. Details of their pronunciation can be reconstructed from Punic and Neo-Punic texts written in Latin or Greek characters (inscriptions, and parts of Plautus&#x27;s comedy &quot;Poenulus&quot;, &#x27;The Little Punic&#x27;).

===Table of consonant phonemes===
=== Vowels ===
The vowels in Punic and Neo-Punic are: short &quot;a, i,&quot; and &quot;u&quot;; their long counterparts &quot;ā, ī,&quot; and &quot;ū&quot;; and &quot;ē&quot; and &quot;ō&quot;, which had developed out of the diphthongs &quot;ay&quot; and &quot;aw&quot;, respectively (for example Punic &quot;mēm&quot;, &#x27;water&#x27;, corresponds to Hebrew &quot;mayim&quot;).

Two vowel changes are noteworthy. In many cases a stressed long &quot;ā&quot; developed into /&quot;o&quot;/, for example in the third person masculine singular of the suffixing conjugation of the verb, &quot;baròk&quot;, &#x27;he has blessed&#x27; (compare Hebrew &quot;baràk&quot;). And in some cases that /&quot;o&quot;/ secondarily developed into &quot;ū&quot;, for example &quot;mū&quot;, &#x27;what?&#x27;, &lt; &quot;mō&quot; &lt; &quot;mā&quot; (cf. Hebrew &quot;māh&quot;, &#x27;what?&#x27;).

In late Punic and Neo-Punic the glottal stop and pharyngeal and laryngeal consonants were no longer pronounced. The signs’&quot;, ‘, h,&quot; and &quot;ḥ&quot; thus became available to indicate vowels. The ‘ayn (&quot;‘&quot;) came to be regularly used to indicate an /&quot;a&quot;/ sound, and also &quot;y&quot; and &quot;w&quot; increasingly were used to indicate /&quot;i&quot;/ and /&quot;o, u&quot;/, respectively. But a consistent system to write vowels never developed.

==Grammar==
In this section &quot;Grammar&quot; the notation &quot;XX (xxxx)&quot; is used, where XX is the spelling in Punic characters (without vowels), while &quot;xxxx&quot; is a phonetic rendering, including vowels, as can be reconstructed from Punic language texts written in the Latin or Greek alphabets.

=== Nouns ===
Nouns, including adjectives, in Punic and Neo-Punic can be of two genders (masculine or feminine), three numbers (singular, dual, or plural), and in two &#x27;states&#x27;, the absolute state or the so-called construct state. A word in the construct state has a close relation with the word that follows, a relation that is often translated by &quot;of&quot;. For example, in the combination &quot;sons of Hanno&quot;, &quot;sons of&quot; would be in the construct state, while &quot;Hanno&quot; would be in the absolute state.

Morphology:
=== Pronouns ===

==== Demonstrative pronoun ====
The demonstrative pronoun &#x27;this, these&#x27; was:
===== Definite article =====
The definite article was evolving from Phoenician &quot;ha-&quot; to an unaspirated article &quot;a-&quot;. By 406 BCE, both variants were attested in the same inscription (CIS I 5510). Although in later times the &quot;h-&quot; was no longer pronounced, the &quot;historical&quot; spelling H- kept being used, in addition to ’- and Ø-, and one even finds Ḥ-.

==== Personal pronoun ====
The personal pronouns, when used on their own, are: (forms between [...] are attested in Phoenician only)

When used as a direct or indirect object (&#x27;me, him&#x27;, &#x27;to me, to him&#x27;) or as a possessive (&#x27;mine, his&#x27;) the personal pronoun takes the form of a suffix. These suffixes can be combined with verbal forms, substantives, and paricles.

Examples:
: &quot; ḤN (ḥan)&quot; = (verb:) &#x27;he has shown favor&#x27; →
:: &quot; ḤN’ (ḥannō)&quot; = &#x27;he has shown favor to him (-ō)&#x27; = proper name Hanno
:: &quot; ḤNYB‘L (ḥannī ba‘al)&quot; = (verb:) &#x27;Ba‘al has shown favor to me (-ī)&#x27; = proper name Hannibal

: &quot; BN (bin)&quot; = &#x27;son&#x27; →
:: &quot; BN’, BNY (binō)&quot; = &#x27;his son&#x27;

: &quot; ’T (’et)&quot; = &#x27;with&#x27; (preposition) →
:: &quot; ’TY (’ittī)&quot; = &#x27;together with me&#x27;

The paradigm for the suffixed personal pronouns is:

==== Relative pronoun ====
The relative pronoun, &#x27;who, that, which&#x27;, in both Punic and Neo-Punic is’ &quot;Š (’īs&quot;). In late Neo-Punic &quot;M’&quot; (&quot;mū&quot;) (originally an interrogative pronoun, &#x27;what?&#x27;) emerged as a second relative pronoun. Both pronouns were not inflected. The combination &quot;’Š M’&quot; (&quot;’īs mū&quot;) was also used in late Neo-Punic.

==== Determinative pronoun ====
A pronoun &quot;Š- (si-&quot;) was used to express an indirect genitival relationship between two substantives; it can be translated as &#x27;of&#x27;. This uninflected pronoun was prefixed to the second of the two substantives. Example:
: HKHNT ŠRBTN (&quot;ha-kohènet si-Rabat-ēn&quot;), &#x27;the priestess of our Lady&#x27;

==== Interrogative pronoun ====
There are two interrogative pronouns:
: &quot; MY (mī)&quot;, &#x27;who?&#x27; (cf. Hebrew &quot;mī&quot;)
: &quot; M’ (mū)&quot;, &#x27;what?&#x27; (cf. Hebrew &quot;māh&quot;). In Neo-Punic this pronoun is also used as a relative pronoun, &#x27;that, which&#x27;.
Neither of the two pronouns was inflected.

==== Indefinite pronoun ====
In Punic and Neo-Punic there was no exclusive indefinite pronoun. Whenever such a pronoun might be needed, it was circumscribed by means of words like &quot; ’ḤD (’ḥḥad)&quot;, &#x27;one&#x27;, &quot; ’Š (’īs)&quot; or &quot; ’DM (’adom)&quot;, &#x27;a man, a person&#x27;, or &quot; KL (kil)&quot;, &#x27;all&#x27;.

=== Verbs ===
==== Morphology ====
The nucleus of Punic and Neo-Punic verbs is a &quot;root&quot; consisting of three or, sometimes, two consonants. By adding prefixes and suffixes, and by varying the vowels that are inserted into the root, the various forms of the verb are formed. These belong to six &quot;stems&quot; (conjugations). The basic, and most common, stem type is the Qal. The other common stems are:
* Niph‘al (the usual passive stem);
* Pi‘el (a so-called intensive stem);
* Yiph‘il (a causative stem; corresponds to the Hiph‘il stem in Hebrew).
A few other stems are found only very rarely:
* Qal Passive;
* Pu‘al (passive of the Pi‘el stem);
* Yitpe‘el (reflexive variant of the Pi‘el; Hebrew Hitpa‘el).

===== Qal =====
The paradigm of the Qal is (the verb &quot;B-R-K&quot; (&quot;barok&quot;), &#x27;to bless&#x27;, is used as an example):
: (note 1:) “the verb &quot;barok&quot;”: &quot;barok&quot; literally means &#x27;he blesses&#x27;, it is tradition to consider the 3rd person masculine suffixing form as the standard form of the Punic verb;
: (note 2:) Forms between [...] are known from Phoenician but have not yet been attested in Punic.

===== Niph‘al =====
The following Niph‘al forms are attested in Punic and Neo-Punic (verb: &quot; P-‘-L, fel&quot;, &#x27;to make&#x27;; &lt; Phoenician &quot;pa‘ol&quot;):

===== Pi‘el =====
The following Pi‘el forms are attested in Punic and Neo-Punic (verb: &quot; Ḥ-D-Š, ḥados&quot;, &#x27;to make new, to restore&#x27;):
===== Yiph‘il =====
The following Yiph‘il forms are attested in Punic and Neo-Punic (verb: &quot; Q-D-Š, qados&quot;, &#x27;to dedicate&#x27;):
===== Weak verbs =====
Many (Neo-)Punic verbs are &quot;weak&quot;: depending on the specific root consonants certain deviations of the standard verbal paradigm occur. For example in the group I-&quot;n&quot; (verbs with first consonant N-) the &quot;n&quot; may disappear through assimilation. Summary:

==== Form and use ====
In Punic there was no one-on-one correlation between form and use. For example, the suffix form (perfect) is often translated by a present tense, but it may also refer to the past or future. Tense, aspect, and mood of verbal forms were determined by syntax, not by morphology.

The tense, aspect and mood of a given verbal form may depend on:
# whether the form is part of the main clause, or of a subordinate clause;
# if in a subordinate clause, it may depend on the &quot;type&quot; of subordinate clause (for example, conditional, or temporal);
# word order may be important: does the verbal form precede or follow the subject of the clause?;
# it also may depend on a verbal form earlier in the same clause: suffix forms or an infinitive absolute used consecutive to another verbal form, take the same tense, aspect and mood as the preceding form.

=== Numbers ===
The numbers from one to ten are:
Punic and Neo-Punic take part in the so-called &quot;Semitic polarity&quot;: the numbers 3-10 take the feminine form with masculine nouns, and vice versa. Thus with masculine BN (&quot;bin&quot;, &#x27;son&#x27;) or YM (&quot;yom&quot;, &#x27;day&#x27;), numbers take the feminine form ending in -T, while with feminine ŠT (&quot;sat&quot;, &#x27;year&#x27;), they take the masculine form without -T. For example:
: &quot;‛W’ Š‛NT ‛SR WŠ‛LŠ (ḥawa’ sanūt ‛asar w-salūs):&quot;
:: &#x27;He lived (verb Ḥ-W-Y, &#x27;to live&#x27;) thirteen years&#x27; (KAI 144)

Multiples of ten take the form of a plural (&quot;-īm&quot;) of the word for 10 or 3-9:
One hundred is M’T (&quot;mīt&quot;), its dual M’TM (&quot;mitēm&quot;) is 200; 1000 is ’LP (&quot;’èlef&quot;), and 10,000 is RB’ (&quot;ribō&quot;).

=== Particles ===
An important particle is the so-called &quot;nota objecti&quot;, or accusative particle, &quot; ’YT (’et)&quot; (rarely &quot; ’T;&quot; usually&quot; T- &quot; before a substantive with definite article or with demonstrative pronoun). It is placed before a substantive and indicates that that substantive is an object in the sentence (mostly a direct object).

=== Syntax ===
Word order in Punic and Neo-Punic can vary, but this variation has its grammatical limits. For example, in a clause with an imperfect prefixing form the subject can either precede or follow the verb. However, as a rule, if the verb precedes it refers to the present, while if the subject precedes, the verb refers to the future.

The repertoire of possible ways in (Neo-)Punic to express a certain combination of tense, aspect, and mood seems to be more restricted than in Phoenician, but at the same time the rules seem to have become less strict.

==Example==
Act V of Plautus&#x27;s comedy &quot;Poenulus&quot; opens with Hanno speaking in Punic, his native language, in the first ten lines. Then follows a slightly different version of the same lines. Charles Krahmalkov is of the opinion that the first ten lines are Neo-Punic, the next ten Punic.

Krahmalkov proposed the theory that Plautus, who often translated Greek comedies into Latin, in this case too reworked a Greek original, the &quot;Karkhedonios&quot; (&#x27;The Carthaginian&#x27;; Athenian comic poet Alexis wrote a play with this title). In this case, there probably also existed a Punic translation of the Greek comedy, and Plautus took parts of this Punic version to give his Carthaginian character authentic speech. Moreover, in this way he could enter puns by introducing in his play would-be translators who, to comical effect, claimed to, but did not in fact, understand Punic, and thus gave nonsensical &#x27;translations&#x27;.

=== Hanno&#x27;s Punic speech ===
Plautus (or a later redactor) next provided a Latin translation of the preceding lines:

===Latin and English translation===

===Comments===
As a Latin transliteration, the text as recorded necessarily departs from the original Punic speech. Lines 930-939 have only survived in one manuscript, the &quot;Ambrosianus&quot; A (the &quot;Ambrosian Palimpsest&quot;). The &quot;unknown&quot; text, lines 940-949, has also survived in three manuscripts of the Palatine family (P). The several manuscript sources show many differences among them, with the P scripts showing some words being split out and some mis-interpretations. The &quot;unknown&quot; text used here is from the Ambrosianus A; both families have lost small chunks of text over time. Recently efforts have been made to, among other things, fill in the redactions in the &quot;unknown language&quot; part and to properly split the morphemes. The close mirroring between lines 930-931/940 and lines 937/947 (underlined above) suggests that the &quot;unknown language&quot; text (lines 940-949) is also Punic. Gratwick and Krahmalkov conclude that the more corrupted &quot;unknown&quot; form (940-949) is earlier (basically Plautus&#x27;s own text in Punic), while lines 930-939 reflect a “late &#x27;scholar&#x27;s repair&#x27;” from Late Antiquity in Neo-Punic. 

Some Punic phrases known in the text include:
* 930/940: &quot;Yth alonim ualoniuth sicorathii (sthymhimi) hymacom syth&quot; = ’T ’LNM W-’LNT ZKRT (Š-QRYT?; [940:] ŠTMḤW?) H-MQM ST.
:: - &quot;yth = ’et&quot;, accusative particle (nota objecti): indicates that an object follows (cf. Hebrew&quot; ’et&quot;)
:: - &quot;alonim = ’alonīm&quot;: plural masculine of&quot; ’alōn&quot;: &#x27;gods&#x27; (cf. Hebrew&quot; ’elōah&quot;, &#x27;god, goddess&#x27;, plural&quot; ’elohîm&quot;); = Latin &quot;deōs&quot;; cf. &quot;alonim&quot; in 933 ~ &quot;di&quot; (&#x27;gods&#x27;) in 953
:: - &quot;u- = w-&quot;, &#x27;and&#x27; (Hebrew &quot;w-&quot;); = Latin &quot;-que&quot;
:: - &quot;aloniuth = ’alonōt&quot;: plural feminine of&quot; ’alōn&quot;: &#x27;goddesses (of)&#x27;; = Latin &quot;deās&quot;
:: - &quot;sicorathi&quot;: corresponds with Hebrew &quot;zakàrti&quot;, &#x27;I have been mindful of, I remember, I keep holy&#x27;; = Latin &quot;veneror&quot; (note: &quot;s&quot; in &quot;sicorathi&quot; ~ &quot;z&quot; in &quot;zakàrti&quot;: in late Punic the four Phoenician sibilants, &quot;s, š, ș,&quot; and &quot;z&quot;, were all pronounced /s/); also interpreted as &quot;si-qart&quot;, &#x27;(of) this city&#x27;, but that is less probable because then a verb is missing in the sentence, and it would make &quot;hymacom syth&quot;, &#x27;this city&#x27;, superfluous.
:: - &quot;hymacom: ha-maqōm&quot;, definite article + &#x27;place, city&#x27; (Hebrew &quot;hammaqōm&quot;); = Latin &quot;urbem&quot; (&#x27;city&#x27;). Note: variant &quot;symacom syth&quot; (line 930) = &quot;šè + maqōm syth&quot;, &#x27;of this city&#x27;. &quot;mucom&quot; in 948 is also &quot;maqōm&quot;.
:: - &quot;syth&quot;: demonstrative pronoun &#x27;this&#x27;, singular feminine (Hebrew: &quot;zōt&quot;) or masculine (Hebrew: &quot;zèh&quot;) = Latin &quot;hanc&quot; (in Hebrew &quot;maqōm&quot;, &#x27;place, city&#x27;, usually is a masculine word, but occasionally it can be feminine). In 940P &quot;esse&quot; is the Plautine Punic spelling, 930 and 940A have the late Neo-Punic spelling &quot;syth&quot;.
* 937/947: &quot;yth emanethi hy chirs aelichot&quot; / &quot;sitt esed anec naso ters ahelicot&quot; = ’T-M ’NKY H’ ḤRŠ (YŠ) H-HLYKT / Š-’TY ’Z ’NK NŠ’ ḤRŠ H-HLYKT.

<doc id="621485" wikidata="Q1280897" url="?curid=621485" title="City of Sunderland">
<text>Sunderland (), also known as the City of Sunderland, is a metropolitan borough with city status in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear, England. It is named after its largest settlement, Sunderland, spanning a far larger area, including nearby towns including Washington, Hetton-le-Hole and Houghton-le-Spring, as well as the surrounding villages and hamlets. The district also forms a large majority of Wearside which includes Chester-le-Street in County Durham. 

The district was formed in 1974 as part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972 and is an amalgamation of four former local government districts of County Durham. It was granted city status in 1992, the Ruby Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s accession to the throne. The borough had a population of 575,400 at the time of the 2011 census, with the majority of the population (274,286) residing in Sunderland, making it the largest settlement in the north east of England.

==History==
The metropolitan borough was formed in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 by the merger of several districts of County Durham – Washington Urban District, Houghton-le-Spring Urban District and Hetton Urban District – with the County Borough of Sunderland.
The borough was granted city status on 20 May 1992 to celebrate the Queen&#x27;s Ruby Jubilee. At the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee the city petitioned to be allowed a Lord Mayor, but was unsuccessful. Although the city does not have a cathedral, as it is located in the Diocese of Durham, it does have Sunderland Minster.

Between 1939 and 1945 the Wear yards launched 245 merchant ships totalling 1.5 million tons, a quarter of the merchant tonnage produced in the UK at this period. Competition from overseas caused a downturn in demand for Sunderland built ships toward the end of the 20th century. The last shipyard in Sunderland closed in 1988.

St Benedict Biscop was adopted as the city&#x27;s patron saint in March 2004.
==City government==

===Functions===
The Local Government Act 1972 created two different two-tier systems for local administration, with different division of functions. As a &quot;metropolitan&quot; authority, Sunderland retained responsibility for waste collection, although disposal of the waste was a county function, and for education. In 1986, when Tyne and Wear Metropolitan County Council was abolished, most county functions became the responsibility of the constituent districts, whilst new &quot;joint boards&quot; assumed the co-ordinating roles in the county. Thus control over economic development, of the Museums and Archive Service, of the Tyne and Wear Fire and Civil Defence Authority and of the Passenger Transport Authority is exercised not by committees of directly elected county councillors but by nominees chosen by the elected members of the five district authorities. 

Sunderland has not had a separate police force since 1967, when the Borough of Sunderland Police merged with Durham Constabulary. The city is now part of the Northumbria Police Force area. This force was set up in 1974, and covers the whole of Tyne and Wear plus the much larger but much less densely populated county of Northumberland.

The city is unparished, except for Hetton-le-Hole which is a civil parish, and which has a town council.

===Political structure===

The city has had a Labour-controlled council since 1974, and often before that. After the elections of May 2003 the political structure was 63 Labour, 9 Conservative, and 1 independent. The only Liberal Party councillor sat with the only Liberal Democrat as a &quot;Liberal/Democrat&quot; group. Three councillors resigned from the Labour Party following disputes over the selection of candidates for the 2004 elections. Two became independent members; one joined the Liberal Democrat party, becoming group leader after the 2004 municipal elections.

The reorganisation of electoral areas saw major changes in all but two wards, but the elections of 10 June 2004, the first fought under the new boundaries, saw little change in the political representation of the city as a whole, with 61 Labour, 12 Conservative, and 2 Liberal Democrat councillors elected.

The Conservative party won all three seats in a new ward whose boundaries spanned several old wards. The Liberal Democrats stronghold ward was abolished entirely, and became part of four new wards, and the Liberal Democrat councillors elected in 2004 were from two very different areas.

Following further disputes within the Labour Party, three councillors resigned the whip at the end of 2006 and, joined by one of the Liberal Democrat members formed an independent group, which is the minority party in opposition.

At the elections of May 2007, Labour lost three seats to the Conservatives, whilst former Labour Mayor Julianna Heron lost to an independent: the same person who had defeated her husband in 2003 and who was in turn defeated by him in 2004. The Conservative party made further significant gains in the 2008 election, gaining five additional seats.

The election in 2010, held at the same time as the general election saw Labour gain four seats to increase their majority. In the 2011 local elections Labour gained a further four seats from the Conservatives. After the 2015 General election the composition of the council was Labour 66, Conservative 6 and independent 3.

After the 2019 Sunderland City Council election, Sunderland became one of the few British councils with all five major parties represented. The council make up was Labour 51, Conservative 12, Liberal Democrats 8, UKIP 3 and Green Party 1.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
Since major boundary changes in 2010, there are three constituencies covering the City of Sunderland, all currently regarded as safe for the Labour Party:

*Houghton and Sunderland South
*Sunderland Central
*Washington and Sunderland West

In the 1992, 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections, the former Sunderland South constituency was the first to declare the results, and the tradition was continued by the new Houghton and Sunderland South seat in 2010 and 2015.

==Twin towns==
Sunderland is twinned with two cities: Essen, Germany, and Saint-Nazaire, France. It also has Friendship Agreements with Washington, D.C., US; and Harbin and Nanjing, both in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Sunderland and Washington share historical links, as the ancestors of the first President of the United States of America, George Washington, lived in Washington Old Hall, which is within the municipal boundaries of Sunderland.

==Dialect==

The Mackem accent and dialect is often mistaken for Geordie by people not from the region, as the two tongues sound similar in pronunciation and diction.
The Sunderland dialect also has several variations between different areas of the city, as demonstrated when the hoax tapes purporting to be of the Yorkshire Ripper were analysed. The tapes were made by a man who came to be known as Wearside Jack, and were thought by linguistic experts to be made by someone specifically from the Castletown area of Sunderland. When the perpetrator, John Humble was eventually caught he confirmed that he did indeed attend school in the Castletown area of Sunderland in his childhood.

== Demography ==
=== Ethnicity ===
==Culture==
===Art and literature===

Lewis Carroll was a frequent visitor to the area. He wrote most of &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; at Whitburn as well as &quot;The Walrus and the Carpenter&quot;. Some parts of the area are also widely believed to be the inspiration for his Alice in Wonderland stories, such as Hylton Castle and Backhouse Park. There is a statue to Carroll in Whitburn library. Lewis Carroll was also a visitor to the Rectory of Holy Trinity Church, Southwick; then a township independent of Sunderland. Carroll&#x27;s connection with Sunderland, and the area&#x27;s history, is documented in Bryan Talbot&#x27;s 2007 graphic novel &quot;Alice in Sunderland&quot;. More recently, Sunderland-born Terry Deary, writer of the series of &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; books, has achieved fame and success, and many others such as thriller writer Sheila Quigley, are following his lead.

The Salford-born painter, L. S. Lowry, was a frequent visitor, staying in the Seaburn Hotel in Sunderland. Many of his paintings of seascapes and shipbuilding are based on Wearside scenes. The Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art on Fawcett Street and Sunderland Museum and Winter Gardens showcase exhibitions and installations from up-and-coming and established artists alike, with the latter holding an extensive collection of Lowry&#x27;s work. The National Glass Centre on Liberty Way also exhibits a number of glass sculptures.

===Music===

Sunderland has produced a modest number of musicians that have gone on to reach international fame, most notably Dave Stewart of the Eurythmics. Kenickie, which featured Lauren Laverne on vocals, also achieved a top ten album and wide critical acclaim in the mid-to-late 1990s. In recent years, a thriving underground music scene in Sunderland has helped the likes of Smalltown Heroes, The futureheads, Field Music, and more recently Frankie &amp; The Heartstrings gain national recognition.

Other famous Sunderland musicians include punk rockers The Toy Dolls, who broke the top five of the charts with &quot;Nellie the Elephant&quot; in December 1984; the melodic hardcore punk band Leatherface; the lead singer of dance outfit Olive, Ruth Ann Boyle, who achieved a UK chart-topper with &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; in May 1997 and has gone on to work with fellow chart-toppers Enigma; and A Tribe of Toffs, who made number 21 with their cult hit &quot;John Kettley is a Weatherman&quot; in December 1988.

On 7 and 8 May 2005, Sunderland played host to BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Big Weekend concert—the UK&#x27;s largest free music festival. The event, held at Herrington Country Park in the shadow of Penshaw Monument, was attended by 30,000 visitors and featured Foo Fighters, Kasabian, KT Tunstall, Chemical Brothers and The Black Eyed Peas.

The Empire Theatre sometimes plays host to music acts. In 2009, it hosts Jane McDonald and The Drifters among others.

The Sunderland Stadium of Light has hosted regular concerts since 2009, including the likes of Oasis, Take That, Coldplay, Kings of Leon and Red Hot Chili Peppers.

===Theatre===

The Sunderland Empire Theatre, opened in 1907, is the largest theatre in the North East, reopened in December 2004 following a major redevelopment allowing it to stage West End shows such as &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;, &quot;Starlight Express&quot; and &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, all of which have been performed at the Empire. The Empire is the only theatre between Leeds and Glasgow large enough to accommodate such shows. It has also played host to an annual season from the Birmingham Royal Ballet for over ten years.

The Royalty Theatre is the home of the amateur Royalty Theatre group who also put on a number of low-budget productions throughout the year. Renowned film producer David Parfitt belonged to this company before achieving worldwide fame and is now a patron of the theatre.

The Empire also played host to the final performance of comic actor Sid James, who died of a heart attack whilst on stage in 1976.

== Economy ==
Sunderland is home to a Nissan car manufacturing plant.

Over recent years Sunderland city centre has seen a re-development of the Sunniside area taking place, with new bars, cafes and retailers opening their doors on the Eastern side of the city. The Sunniside area now includes an Empire Cinema, Gala Casino and many surrounding eateries.

The Bridges Shopping Centre covers much of the city centre and was opened in 1988. It is currently owned by Land Securities Group after they purchased the site in 1990. The centre receives over 26million shopping visits every year.

=== Media, internet, film and television ===
Sunderland has two local newspapers: the daily evening tabloid, the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot;, founded in 1873, and the &quot;Sunderland Star—&quot;a free newspaper. It also has its own community radio station Spark Sunderland, and a hospital radio station – Radio Sunderland for Hospitals, and can receive other north-eastern independent radio stations Hits Radio North East, Greatest Hits North East, Capital North East, Heart North East, Nation Radio North East and Smooth North East. The current regional BBC radio station is BBC Radio Newcastle. The city is covered by BBC North East and Cumbria and ITV Tyne Tees, which has a regional office in the university&#x27;s Media Centre.

Sunderland was named &quot;The Facebook Capital of Britain&quot; by the BBC in February 2010. The statistics showed that people in Sunderland were more likely to log on to the social networking site than anywhere else in the UK.

==Sport==
The only professional sporting team in Sunderland is the football team, Sunderland A.F.C., which was formed in 1879, and plays home games at the 49,000-seat-capacity Stadium of Light.

Sunderland also has the north-east&#x27;s top women&#x27;s football team, Sunderland A.F.C. Women, who have been financially separated from the men&#x27;s team since summer 2005. They currently play in the top tier of English women&#x27;s football, FA Women&#x27;s Premier League National Division, despite their financial struggles.

Sunderland&#x27;s longest stadium occupancy so far was of Roker Park for 99 years beginning in 1898, with relocation taking place due to the stadium&#x27;s confined location and the need to build an all-seater stadium. The initial relocation plan had been for a stadium to be situated alongside the Nissan factory, but these were abandoned in favour of the Stadium of Light at Monkwearmouth on the site of a colliery that had closed at the end of 1993.

Since the dissolution of Sunderland Nissan F.C., Sunderland itself now has only one non-league side, Sunderland Ryhope Community Association F.C. who now play in the Northern League Division One after a successful promotion campaign in the 2009/10 season. However, Washington F.C. also hail from Washington in the city.

<doc id="621492" wikidata="Q199860" url="?curid=621492" title="Coat of arms of Serbia">
<text>The [[coat of arms]] of the Republic of Serbia () consists of two main heraldic symbols which represent the identity of the Serbian state and Serbian people across the centuries: the Serbian eagle (a silver double-headed eagle adopted from the Nemanjić dynasty) and the Serbian cross (or cross with firesteels). The coat of arms also features the Serbian historical crown; while unusual for republics, it is not unprecedented, as can be seen in coat of arms of numerous European countries with republican form of government (Russia, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Montenegro, and San Marino). However, Serbia&#x27;s coat of arms still retains strong monarchist elements absent from the other republics, including the mantle and pavillon found in the greater coat of arms of some modern and many historical monarchies. 

The coat of arms is used in the form of the greater coat of arms (Велики грб / &quot;Veliki grb&quot;) and lesser coat of arms (Мали грб / &quot;Mali grb&quot;), as provided by the Article 7 of the Constitution of Serbia.

== Description ==
The coat of arms is a silver stylized double-headed eagle on a red shield with a crown above the shield. The eagle&#x27;s heads are bordered with nine feathers each and face the outer sides of the shield. The beaks of the double-headed eagle are golden in color and gape wide. The feathers on the eagle&#x27;s neck are arranged in four rows of seven feathers. The wings of the eagle are spread out and together with the tail and heads form a cross, and on each wing there are four rows of feathers with the following arrangement: in the first row there are seven feathers, in the second row there are nine feathers (two large and seven smaller ones), in the third row seven feathers, in the fourth row there are seven feathers (four large and three smaller). The eagle&#x27;s legs are spread diagonally across the shield, and under each claw is a fleur-de-lis; the legs and claws of the eagle are golden in color. The feathers on the legs are white and there are seven of them. The eagle&#x27;s tail is positioned in relation to the vertical axis of the shield, seven feathers are arranged in three rows; the tips of all the feathers on the double-headed white eagle are rounded. On the chest of the double-headed white eagle there is a small red semicircular shield divided by a white cross into four fields with one firesteels in each field. The firesteels are white facing the outer sides of the shield. The crown is positioned centrally in relation to the vertical axis of the shield and the heads of the eagles. The crown is golden, decorated with forty white pearls, eight blue sapphires and two red rubies, and on top of the crown there is a cross.

The blazon is as follows:

- the Greater coat of arms is a red shield crowned with a golden crown and surmounted by porphyry embroidered with gold, decorated with gold fringes, tied with gold cord with the same such tassels, set with ermine and crowned with a golden crown.

- the Lesser coat of arms is a red shield crowned with a golden crown - the inescutcheon used by Serbian states and the Serbian church since the Middle Ages.

== History ==

The use of the double-headed eagle dates back to the 11th century. The figure often appears on inscriptions, medieval frescoes and embroidery on the clothes of Byzantine and Serbian royalty. Grand Prince Stefan Nemanja (r. 1166–1196) was among the first in Serbia who used the symbol of the double-headed eagle and the Nemanjić dynasty of which he is a founder, used the symbol as its coat of arms. The surviving golden ring of Queen Teodora (1321–1322) has the symbol engraved. During the reign of Emperor Stefan Dušan (r. 1331–1345), the double-headed eagle was used on everyday objects and state-related documents, such as tax stamps and proclamations. In 1339, the map-maker Angelino Dulcert marked the Serbian Empire with a flag with a red double-headed eagle. Contemporary Serbian noble families (Mrnjavčević and Lazarević) also adopted the symbol as a symbolic continuation. Prince Lazar (r. 1371–1389), when renovating the Hilandar monastery of Mount Athos, engraved the double-headed eagle at the northern wall. The &quot;Codex Monacensis Slavicus 4&quot; (fl. 1371–1389) has richly attested artwork of the Serbian eagle. The double-headed eagle was officially adopted by Stefan Lazarević after he received the title of &quot;despot&quot;, the second highest Byzantine title, from John VII Palaiologos in 1402 at the imperial court in Constantinople. The Serbian Orthodox Church also adopted it; the entrance of the Žiča monastery, which was the seat of the Archbishop of the Serbs between 1219–1253, and by tradition the coronational church of the Serbian kings, is engraved with the double-headed eagle. 
The Serbian cross, surrounded by four firesteels, possibly also derives from a Byzantine emblem. It strongly resembles the imperial emblem used in Byzantine flags during the late (Palaiologan) age. As a Byzantine symbol though, it might date back to several centuries earlier. Serbian historian Stanoje Stanojević argues that it was officially adopted as a Serbian symbol as early as 1345, with Stefan Dušan&#x27;s raising to a Serbian Empire. In contrast, Stojan Novaković posits that the recorded use of the Serbian cross, as a national symbol, began in 1397, during the rule of Stefan Lazarević. It was possibly derived from a known candle chandelier at Visoki Dečani. Later, the Serbian cross is found in the Korenić-Neorić Armorial (1595), which shows the coat of arms of Serbia (&quot;Svrbiae&quot;) as a white cross over a red and gold background, also depicting the Mrnjavčević noble house with the same design, with inverted colours and the Serbian eagle in the center of the cross. According to Mavro Orbini (1607), it was used by Vukašin Mrnjavčević (r. 1365–1371) and Prince Lazar (r. 1371–1389). The Palaiologan cross as the Serbian coat of arms first appeared in Pavao Ritter Vitezović&#x27;s book Stemmatografia (1701), and after its publication, the Serbian church began using the symbol, and its popularity grew until Prince Miloš Obrenović adopted it as official coat of arms of the Principality of Serbia in 1838. The Serbian cross then appeared on all modern Serbian coats of arms, except the coat of arms of the Socialist Republic of Serbia from 1947, which had the cross removed, leaving only the four stylized firesteels; this was done symbolically by the Yugoslav government to &quot;socially curtail and politically marginalize religious communities and religion in general&quot;. In modern times, a Serbian folk etymology interpreted the firesteels around the cross as four Cyrillic letters &quot;S&quot; (С), for the motto &quot;Only Unity Saves the Serbs&quot; (&quot;Samo sloga Srbina spasava&quot;). In all of the modern coat of arms though (see gallery below), however, the figures retain the straight side of the letter B, or at least a projection in the middle, that is the middle part of &quot;B&quot; between the two semicircles.

The current coat of arms is based on the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Serbia as enacted by the &quot;Law on the coat of arms&quot; of 1882. It was formally readopted in 2004 through official recommendation, adopted by law in 2009 and standardized in 2010.

== Usage ==
The greater coat of arms is used on the buildings and premises of the President of the Republic, the Government, the National Assembly, the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Court, the Supreme Public Prosecutor, the Ombudsman, the State Audit Institution, and the National Bank of Serbia, as well as in their seals and stamps (banknotes and coins issued by the National Bank of Serbia). It is also used on the buildings and premises of embassies and consulates abroad.

The lesser coat of arms is used far more frequently, appearing on national flag, on most of the public documents (passports, identity cards, driver&#x27;s licences, firearms licenses, birth certificates, etc.), uniforms of the uniformed services such as police and customs; on the buildings of other state bodies, provincial and local, as well as public services and in their seals and stamps. It can also be used during celebrations, ceremonies, cultural or sports events that are significant for the state.

<text>The Imperial War Cabinet (IWC) was the British Empire&#x27;s wartime coordinating body. It met over three sessions, the first from 20 March to 2 May 1917, the second from 11 June to late July 1918, and the third from 20 or 25 November 1918 to early January 1919. Consisting of representatives from Canada, Australia, India, the Dominion of Newfoundland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom, the Cabinet considered many aspects of waging the First World War. It led to the United Kingdom&#x27;s Dominions being considered more equal to Great Britain and Ireland. Held concurrently with the cabinet were the Imperial War Conferences of 1917 and 1918.

==Background==
In 1887, the First Colonial Conference was held. It was organised at the behest of the Imperial Federation League in hopes of creating closer ties between the colonies and the United Kingdom. It was attended by more than 100 delegates, mostly unofficial observers, from both self-governing and dependent colonies. India, however, was not represented. Further Colonial Conferences (later Imperial Conferences) were held in 1894, 1897, 1902, 1907, and 1911. The British Empire was ill prepared upon the outbreak of World War I for land warfare, consisting of a small professional force with 247,432 regular troops. David Lloyd George was named Minister of Munitions in 1915 and played a large role helping wage the war. He became Prime Minister of the United Kingdom on 7 December 1916. The purpose of the Imperial War Cabinet was to bring Britain&#x27;s important Dominions and India up to the same status as the mother country to discuss war strategy, and to further the cause of Imperial Federation.

==Meetings==

On 14 December 1916, Lloyd George cabled all countries in the British Empire, informing them that &quot;Your Prime Minister will be a member of the War Cabinet.&quot; Jan Smuts arrived on 12 March 1917, to large crowds. Robert Borden secretly departed and arrived in February 1917, and all of the involved Prime Ministers were present by 20 March 1917 (with the exception of Billy Hughes of Australia), and the first meeting of the Imperial War Cabinet was held. Lloyd George said that formation of the cabinet marked &quot;the beginning of a new epoch in the history of the Empire,&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; wrote the following day:

Though led by the British Prime Minister &quot;primus inter pares&quot; (and in his absence the Prime Minister of Canada), the countries involved were largely treated as equals. Between 20 March and 2 May 1917, the cabinet had 14 meetings, with involved prime ministers splitting their time between the cabinet and the concurrently running Imperial War Conferences. Proceedings of the cabinet were secret, but it is thought that &quot;much of the energy of the War Cabinet was devoted to the grave question of increasing the number of troops available.&quot; The British War Cabinet continued to make most strategic decisions. Smuts attended the meetings of the British War Cabinet after the disbanding of the IWC.

The Imperial War Cabinet met again on 11 June 1918, with a gathering in the Royal Gallery on 21 June marking the arrival of thirteen current and former Prime Ministers. The Cabinet engaged in many policy decisions, including asking Canada to send troops to Siberia, and travelling to a meeting of the Supreme War Council on 4 or 5 July and later on 3 December. The IWC decided that Prime Ministers of the Dominions had a right to communicate directly with the British Prime Minister. After six weeks, the cabinet disbanded in late July 1918. A &quot;minister of cabinet rank&quot; from all represented Dominions remained in London for the duration of the war.

On 27 October, the IWC was called together to help discuss the peace settlement, and on 20 or 25 November the cabinet began its third session (though without representatives from New Zealand and India, and South African representatives didn&#x27;t arrive until 16 December). It considered the terms of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 and on 3 December the cabinet heard French Marshal Ferdinand Foch and French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. Through the rest of December, the IWC would confer with Italian Prime Minister Vittorio Emanuele Orlando, Italian Foreign Minister Sidney Sonnino, and US President Woodrow Wilson. In January 1919, the cabinet&#x27;s operations were largely transferred to France as the British Empire delegation.

<doc id="621495" wikidata="Q1764135" url="?curid=621495" title="Lees Ferry">
<text>Lees Ferry (also known as Lee&#x27;s Ferry, Lee Ferry, Little Colorado Station and Saints Ferry) is a site on the Colorado River in Coconino County, Arizona in the United States, about southwest of Page and south of the Utah–Arizona state line.

Due to its unique geography – the only place in hundreds of miles from which one can easily access the Colorado River from both sides – it historically served as an important river crossing and starting in the mid-19th century was the site of a ferry operated by John Doyle Lee, for whom it is named. Boat service at Lees Ferry continued for over 55 years before being superseded by a bridge in the early 20th century, which allowed for much more efficient automobile travel.

Lees Ferry served as a military outpost for 19th-century settlements in Utah, a center of limited gold seeking and since the 1920s the principal point at which river flow is measured to determine water allocations in the Colorado River basin. Lees Ferry demarcates the boundary between the Upper and Lower Basins of the Colorado River; the states which make up each basin are legally allocated one-half of the river&#x27;s natural flow. Glen Canyon Dam impounds the Colorado a short distance upstream and completely regulates the river flow past Lees Ferry. Lees Ferry has long been a focal point of American Southwest water disputes, and has been called &quot;both the physical and spiritual heart of water history in the arid West&quot;. Today Lees Ferry is a well-known fishing and boat launching point, including for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon.

==Geography and geology==
Lees Ferry is located in northern Arizona, at the point where the Paria River joins the Colorado from the north. Lying in an open valley directly downstream from Glen Canyon and shortly above Marble Canyon (the uppermost section of the Grand Canyon), it is the only place in more than where the Colorado is not hemmed in by sheer canyon walls. This made it an important crossing point before the construction of Navajo and Glen Canyon Bridges in the 20th century. Here, the Colorado River is also much smoother and calmer than the stretches that lie above and below. In the past, another crossing was the former Glen Canyon reach, but it is now flooded under Lake Powell, formed by Glen Canyon Dam upstream. Lees Ferry is designated within the southwesternmost extreme of Glen Canyon National Recreation Area and is considered the northernmost end of Grand Canyon National Park. It lies upstream of the Colorado&#x27;s mouth at the Gulf of California, at the approximate halfway mark of the river&#x27;s length.

The surrounding valley formed because of a swell in the underlying rock of the Colorado Plateau that caused the regional elevation to intersect the Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, deposited in the Triassic about 208–245 million years ago. This area contains sandstone, siltstone, shale and limestone formed by the sediments on ancient seabeds and later alluvial deposits made by the Colorado and Paria Rivers. Because these are more easily eroded than the rock layers that lie above and below them, the Colorado Plateau gradually slopes down to river level at Lees Ferry through a series of flat benchlands.

==History==

===Early inhabitants and explorers===
In pre-Columbian times, the Lees Ferry area was inhabited first by Paleo-Indians, who populated the region beginning about 11,500 years ago, followed by the Archaic culture, which appeared on the Colorado Plateau about 8,000 years ago. The Anasazi, Paiute and Navajo peoples, who left more evidence of habitation in the valley, arrived only in the last 1,000 years or so. Evidence, including the discovery of two ruins nearby on the Paria River, suggests that the Anasazi utilized the area sometime in the 12th century A.D. Nonetheless, indigenous peoples generally did not make extensive use of the Lees Ferry area and other canyon stretches of the Colorado River, preferring the open plains above for hunting. However, Lees Ferry did later become a disputed territory between the Navajos and Paiutes, who recognized it as a valuable livestock watering point.

The first Europeans who happened upon Lees Ferry were members of the 18th-century Domínguez–Escalante expedition, an attempt to find an overland route through the Southwest between Spanish settlements in present-day New Mexico and California, and in the process, to convert as many Southwestern Native Americans as possible to Christianity. In late 1776, the party ran out of supplies in what is now southern Utah and having decided to turn back towards Santa Fe, had to find a way to cross the Colorado River. Their Native American guides told them of two regional fords of the river, one at the site of Lees Ferry and the other at Glen Canyon. When the explorers arrived at Lees Ferry in October, they found the river too wide and deep and had no choice but to head for the second ford more than upstream. Almost two weeks later they successfully crossed the river, and made it back to Santa Fe on January 2, 1777. This point, now submerged under Lake Powell, is named Crossing of the Fathers after Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante, the two Franciscan priests who headed the expedition.

During the 19th century, Lees Ferry served as a gateway for the expansion of settlement from Utah south into Arizona. Most of the settlers were Mormons, who had been long established in the Utah Valley near present-day Salt Lake City, and were looking for additional land. Although the river at Lee&#x27;s Ferry is too deep to ford for most of the year, its relatively calm current presented an attractive site for crossing by boat. Jacob Hamblin successfully crossed the river here in 1864, and during the next few years the Mormon presence swelled to the scale of a small military outpost (Lee&#x27;s Ferry Fort) in order to defend against Navajo raids. However, these works eventually fell into disrepair as a result of not being able to sustain themselves in the valley.

===John D. Lee and the ferry (1870–1876)===

John D. Lee, for whom Lees Ferry is now named, came to the crossing in 1870 with the goal of setting up a permanent ferry service for Mormon settlers heading south to Arizona. In 1857, Lee had taken part in the Mountain Meadows Massacre, in which a group of Mormons and Native Americans attacked a passing non-Mormon wagon train from Arkansas, killing about 120 people. The ill-conceived attack was the result of several factors including hysteria surrounding the 1857 &quot;Utah War&quot; and animosity toward Arkansans after the murder of Mormon apostle Parley P. Pratt near Van Buren, Arkansas. Years after the massacre, Lee moved to the remote Colorado River crossing to take refuge from the law.

Lee arrived in September with two of his wives and his children, and created a small settlement named Lonely Dell. The ferry was formally established in January 1873, with the launching of the &quot;Colorado&quot;, the first of many boats that would ply the treacherous and fluctuating river at this point. The location of the ferry upstream from the Paria River confluence required passengers to traverse a dangerous incline nicknamed &quot;Lee&#x27;s Backbone&quot; on their ascent up the south wall of the valley. Four years later, Lee was finally arrested by the U.S. government and tried for his role in the massacre. Found guilty, he was executed by firing squad at Mountain Meadows on March 28, 1877. He was the only participant in the massacre to be tried and executed out of the over fifty men who had participated.

===1877–1929===

After Lee&#x27;s death, his wife Emma continued to operate the ferry for two years, in 1878 establishing an alternative ferry route below the confluence of the Paria River that allowed travelers to avoid the infamous Lee&#x27;s Backbone segment. However, this route could not be used in the summer months due to dangerous high water levels from snowmelt. In 1879, the LDS Church bought the ferry and transferred its operation to Warren Marshall Johnson and his family. In 1896 the ferry was transferred to Jim Emett, who installed a cable across the Colorado River to reduce the risk of boats washing downstream during high water.

During this time, Lees Ferry and the surrounding area attracted people because of a series of gold strikes in southern Utah, beginning with Cass Hite, a prospector who discovered gold in Glen Canyon in 1883. Gold seekers came to the area as early as 1889, when two Mormon prospectors by the names of Holladay and Huntington began to explore the surrounds of Lees Ferry. The most extravagant investment was a full-scale mining operation led by Charles H. Spencer, head of the American Placer Company, who came to Lees Ferry in 1910 planning to extract gold from the Chinle Formation. Spencer brought in tons of equipment including a steamboat, the &quot;Charles H. Spencer&quot;, reputedly the largest vessel ever to float the Colorado River upstream of the Grand Canyon. The operation was a dismal failure, and Spencer left, broke, in 1912. The steamboat sank in 1921 and now lies in pieces along the Colorado from Glen Canyon to below Lees Ferry.

The ferry continued to run until 1928. In 1929 the first Navajo Bridge was completed at a location downstream and allowed for far more efficient road travel between Utah and Arizona. Somewhat ironically, the ferry was instrumental in transporting materials for the bridge until June 1928, when the ferryboat capsized, drowning three men and dumping a Ford Model T. The ferry was never replaced, and the bridge was completed seven months later, relegating Lees Ferry from a crowded transportation hub to a quiet backwater.

==Water rights==
Since August 1921, Lees Ferry has been the site of a stream gage operated by the U.S. Geological Survey and has since accumulated one of the most extensive streamflow records ever made in the United States. The river flow here is the principal factor in allocating water to the seven U.S. and two Mexican states in the Colorado River basin. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 apportioned an equal portion of the river&#x27;s flow to the Upper Basin (the U.S. states of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming and northern Arizona) and the Lower Basin (Arizona, California and Nevada), with the individual &quot;basins&quot; divided by an imaginary line at Lees Ferry.

Total allocations, including a later 1944 treaty with Mexico guaranteeing that country most of the remaining water in the river, ran up to 16.5 million acre feet (20.3 km3), which was believed to be the natural flow of the Colorado River based on early observations at Lees Ferry and other gages along the river. To fully utilize these allocations and prevent water from &quot;wasting&quot; to the ocean, the U.S. federal government constructed a number of large storage dams on the Colorado River system. The canyon country around Lees Ferry was considered for the site of the first dam, but was abandoned in favor of a site lower on the Colorado, where Hoover Dam was completed in 1936. In the 1960s, the area was again investigated as part of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation&#x27;s Colorado River Storage Project, and that assessment culminated in the construction of Glen Canyon Dam in 1966. The filling of the resulting Lake Powell of 24.3 million acre feet (30.0 km3) inundated the Crossing of the Fathers, Charles Spencer&#x27;s old mining operation, and other historic landmarks of the area. Flood control at Glen Canyon also smoothed out the seasonal flux of the Colorado River that so beleaguered the ferry operations at Lees Ferry in the past.

Lees Ferry has long been a focal point of American Southwest water disputes, and has been called &quot;both the physical and spiritual heart of water history in the arid West&quot;. From the 1940s onward, Colorado River flows were found to average significantly less than what was allocated under the two treaties, and 21st century studies have postulated that the actual sustainable flow past Lees Ferry is between 13.5 and 14.7 million acre feet (16.7–18.1 km3), creating water supply issues for the river basin.

==Lees Ferry today==

Lees Ferry is considered the official beginning of Grand Canyon National Park on the Colorado River and is used as a fishing area and river rafting launch site. The main access is by Lees Ferry Road, which splits off from U.S. Route 89A at the hamlet of Marble Canyon, Arizona, on the west side of the Navajo Bridges. The Lonely Dell Ranch Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 and expanded to include Lees Ferry in 1997, features several buildings built during and after John D. Lee&#x27;s brief tenure at the site along with some remnants of the &quot;Charles H. Spencer&quot;. A small historical cemetery is located nearby. The area is managed by the National Park Service within the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area as a historical site.

Lees Ferry is the principal starting point for whitewater rafting trips through the Grand Canyon, which are said to offer &quot;a trip backwards through time&quot; as the river cuts through progressively older strata. The majority of trips are run by commercial rafting enterprises using both paddle and motorized inflatable rafts to carry large parties of tourists (up to 24 passengers per raft) on the river with most trips lasting from one week to ten days. Some trips travel all the way to Lake Mead, downstream, and can last several weeks. Permits for private trips are no longer backlogged on an extensive waiting list, but instead are now based on a lottery system. All but the most experienced rapid runners are discouraged from this potentially dangerous trip.

Trips upstream from the nearby Paria Riffle may be made without special permit (other than a day use boating fee) and users may travel upstream on calm waters to the foot of Glen Canyon Dam. This reach of the Colorado River is also well known for its status as a Blue Ribbon fishery, thanks to releases of cold, clear water from Glen Canyon Dam that make conditions ideal for introduced rainbow trout. While the river here has been stocked with rainbows since 1964, the implementation of a more stable flow regime at Glen Canyon Dam in 1991 has somewhat reduced the average size of fish caught there due to the increased survival rate of young fish and the resulting competition.

Lees Ferry is also the ending point for backpacking and canyoneering trips down the Paria River, which features historic petroglyphs, slot canyons, waterfalls and natural bridges including Wrather Arch, the longest such formation in the U.S. outside of Utah.

Fishing is an especially important part of the local recreational use of Lees Ferry drawing thousands of anglers a year seeking large trout. In given year there are possible world record fish available in the Glen Canyon Dam area.

===In film===
Irvin Willat and a cast and crew of 200 people used Lees Ferry during the filming of &quot;The Heritage of the Desert&quot;, released in 1924. Lee&#x27;s Ferry is also mentioned as one of the stops in the film &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939).

Scenes from the movie &quot;Into the Wild&quot; (based on the book by Jon Krakauer) were shot on location in 2006 at the Lees Ferry National Park Service Station, which featured actors Emile Hirsch as Christopher McCandless and Steven Wiig as the Lees Ferry Ranger, Steve Koehler.

In the second season of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot; episode four &#x27;Lucy runs the rapids&#x27; filmed on location at Lee&#x27;s Ferry.

== Early life and musical beginnings ==
Michael Steven Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, on September 9, 1975, the son of Lewis Bublé, a fisherman, and Amber (née Santaga), a homemaker. Bublé&#x27;s paternal and maternal great-grandparents immigrated to Canada from Italy. His surname was originally spelled &quot;Bubli&quot;, and some of his paternal ancestors came from Istria. Bublé stated: He has two younger sisters, Brandee, a children&#x27;s book author, and Crystal, an actress. He and his siblings were raised Roman Catholic. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.

According to an &quot;Oprah Winfrey&quot; interview on October 10, 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer. His interest in jazz began at around age five when his family played Bing Crosby&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; album. His musical influences include Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Tony Bennett, Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin and Sam Cooke.

The first time his family noticed his singing talent was during the Christmas holidays, when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase when the family was singing to the song &quot;White Christmas&quot; on a car ride.

Bublé also has a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good enough. He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.

From the age of 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates. He called the experience 

His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà, a plumber from Preganziol, Treviso, who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson. Bublé&#x27;s grandfather paid for his singing lessons. Both his voice teacher, Sandi Siemens, and his maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Bublé&#x27;s maternal grandmother, Iolanda (née Moscone), was also Italian, from Carrufo, L&#x27;Aquila.

Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather&#x27;s collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. 

Bublé never stopped believing he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be . He stated he never learned to read and write music, using only emotion to drive his songwriting ability.

At age 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won, but was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich for being underage. Delich entered him in the Canadian Youth Talent Search. After Bublé won that contest, he asked Delich to be his manager. Delich represented him for the next seven years, during which Bublé worked diligently at any job that came along: clubs, conventions, cruise ships, hotel lounges, shopping malls, and talent shows.

In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV&#x27;s &quot;Death Game&quot; (also known as &quot;Mortal Challenge&quot;) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of &quot;The X-Files&quot; as a member of a submarine crew. His first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled &quot;Big Band Boom!&quot;, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau&#x27;s national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based programme aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé&#x27;s favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show&#x27;s music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.

Bublé received two Genie Award nominations for Best Original Song in 2000 for &quot;I&#x27;ve Never Been in Love Before&quot; and &quot;Dumb ol&#x27; Heart&quot;, two songs he wrote for the film &quot;Here&#x27;s to Life!&quot;. He recorded three independent albums: &quot;First Dance&quot; (1996), &quot;Babalu&quot; (2001), and &quot;Dream&quot; (2002).

Michael McSweeney, an aide to former prime minister Brian Mulroney, saw Bublé&#x27;s performance at a business party and received a copy of Bublé&#x27;s self-financed independent album. McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney&#x27;s daughter, Caroline, where he sang Kurt Weill&#x27;s &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. At the wedding, Bublé was introduced to David Foster, a multiple Grammy Award-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as Madonna, Brandy Norwood, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, Kenny G, Cher, Josh Groban, and Andrea Bocelli.

David Foster was reluctant to sign Bublé to his 143 Records label because he . Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production under his label, with no assurances of support from Warner Brothers. Additionally, Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster&#x27;s friend, musician and songwriter Paul Anka. After David Foster agreed to produce Bublé&#x27;s debut album, Bruce Allen, whom Bublé had pursued for years to be his manager, also signed Bublé.

<text>The yellow-eared bulbul (Pycnonotus penicillatus) is a species of songbird in the bulbul family of passerine birds. It is an endemic resident breeder in the highlands of Sri Lanka. The common name is also used as an alternate name for the yellow-throated bulbul.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The yellow-eared bulbul was formerly classified in the monotypic genus &quot;Kelaartia&quot;, named after Dr. E.F. Kelaart. Alternate names for the yellow-eared bulbul include the Ceylon bulbul, Sri Lanka bulbul and yellow-tufted bulbul.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow eared-bulbul is endemic to Sri Lanka and is the least common of the bulbuls found in Sri Lanka. This is a bird of jungle and wooded farmland. Despite its restricted range, it is quite readily found at sites such as Horton Plains, Piduruthalagala peak, Moonplains and Victoria Park in Nuwara Eliya and has been frequently sighted in rocky hills.

==Description==

The yellow-eared bulbul is about in length, with a long tail. It has olive upperparts and yellowish underparts. The crown of the head is grey, and there are yellow ear tufts and a yellow patch below the eye. There is a white tuft in front of the eye and the throat is also white.

Sexes are similar in plumage, but young birds are duller than adults. The flight is bouncing and woodpecker-like.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Yellow-eared bulbuls build their nest in a bush with two eggs in a typical clutch. They feed on fruit and insects. Nests are open and cup-shaped. Material such as roots and lichen are used in building the nests. Breeding season usually occurs around February-May and again during August-October.

==Cultural references==
The yellow-eared bulbul appears on the 10-rupee Sri Lankan postage stamp and can also be seen on the new LKR රු5000 note of Sri Lanka.

<text>Military ranks and rank insignia of Norway were changed June 1, 2016, with the reintroduction of the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps, and the abolishment of the one-tier officer system in place since 1975.

==New system of 2023==
The Storting adopted in 2015 the new scheme for military personnel, . From 2016, the Norwegian Defence Forces have two career ladders for the military personnel; one officer scheme for personnel with a degree from the military academy, or a university degree and qualification courses, and a non-commissioned officer scheme for personnel with non-commissioned officer school. In 2023 the ranks of , , and were removed and the navy adopted new enlisted rank insignia.

===System 1975–2016===
Norway did not have a non-commissioned officer system and thus Sergeant and Petty officer are grouped with the officers under the common designation . The officers are divided into three groups: The (company officers, ranks Ensign to Captain inclusive), the staff officers (, ranks Major to brigadier inclusive), and the generals (Major General to General inclusive).

 (Ensign) used to be referred to as Second Lieutenant (), while the rank of lieutenant went by First Lieutenant. The rank of Brigadier is not an old tradition in the Norwegian armed forces and was instated as a replacement for (First Colonel); what is now used to be (Second Colonel). As shown, the Cavalry have two ranks which differ from the regular Army: Dragon (Dragoon) instead of (Private), and (Rittmeister) instead of (Captain).

The ranks of and were bestowed upon soldiers who have finished the 12 months compulsory service and had signed one or more three-year contracts to continue serving. The ranks of (Corporal/Leading Rate) were usually ascribed to soldiers with long and/or outstanding service, though may be bestowed on soldiers with extra responsibilities (e.g. the shift-commander among a group of soldiers on guard-duty). A (Rate Corporal/Petty Officer-in-training) was a soldier who has finished the UB course , a course intended to prepare conscripted soldiers for non-commissioned officer duties, but still under training in &quot;the field&quot;. After one-year course and service these soldiers were qualified for the rank of or .

<doc id="621512" wikidata="Q424432" url="?curid=621512" title="Ergoline">
<text>Ergoline is a core structure in many alkaloids and their synthetic derivatives. Ergoline alkaloids were first characterized in ergot. Some of these are implicated in the condition of ergotism, which can take a convulsive form or a gangrenous form. Even so, many ergoline alkaloids have been found to be clinically useful. Annual world production of ergot alkaloids has been estimated at 5,000–8,000 kg of all ergopeptines and 10,000–15,000 kg of lysergic acid, used primarily in the manufacture of semi-synthetic derivatives.

Others, such as lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, a semi-synthetic derivative, and ergine, a natural derivative found in &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot;, &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; and related species, are known psychedelic substances.

==Natural occurrence==
Ergoline alkaloids are found in fungi such as Claviceps purpurea, Claviceps paspali, and the related Periglandula, which have a permanent, symbiotic bond with numerous flowering vines, most notably, &quot;Turbina corymbosa&quot; and &quot;Ipomoea tricolor&quot; (“morning glory”). Ergolines are concentrated in the seeds, which have been used for ages by indigenous central/south Americans (i.e. T. corymbosa seeds are known as &quot;ololiuhqui&quot;) The principal alkaloids in the seeds appear to be ergine and isoergine, but they&#x27;re just decomposition products of lysergic acid hydroxyethylamide, isolysergic hydroxyethylamide, lysergic acid hydroxymethylethylamide (syn. &quot;ergonovine&quot;), and isolysergic acid hydroxymethylethylamide (syn. &quot;ergonovinine&quot;). All of the other ergolines have been quantified in very small amts. except for penniclavine, which was found to be the predominant ergoline in a 2016 assay of I. tricolor seeds. Ergolines have been identified in 42 Morning Glory species. The only ergolines of these seeds that have been trialed as isolates are ergine, ergonovine, and lysergol, with lysergol showing the weakest effect (refs: Ergine / Psychedelic Effects, Ergometrine / Psychedelic Effects).

==History==
Ergoline alkaloids were first isolated from ergot, a fungus that infects rye and causes ergotism or St. Anthony&#x27;s fire. Reports of the toxic effects due to ergoline alkaloids date back to the 12th century. Ergot also has a long history of medicinal use, which led to attempts to characterize its activity chemically. First reports of its use date back to 1582, where preparations of ergot were used in small doses by midwives to induce strong uterine contractions. The first use of ergoline alkaloids in modern medicine was described in 1808 by John Stearns, an American physician, who had reported on the uterine contractile actions of a preparation of ergot as a remedy for &quot;quickening birth&quot;.

Attempts to characterize the activity of ergoline alkaloids began in 1907, with the isolation of ergotoxine by G. Barger and F. H. Carrin. However, the industrial production of ergot alkaloids didn&#x27;t begin until 1918, when Arthur Stoll patented the isolation of ergotamine tartrate, which was marketed by Sandoz in 1921. Following the determination of the basic chemical structure of the ergot alkaloids in 1930, an era of intensive exploration of synthetic derivatives began and industrial production of ergoline alkaloids exploded, with Sandoz continuing to be the leading company in their production worldwide, up until 1950 when other competitors arose. The company, now renamed Novartis, still retains its leadership in the product of ergot alkaloids. In 1943, Arthur Stoll and Albert Hofmann reported the first total synthesis of an ergot alkaloid, ergometrine. Though the synthesis found no industrial application, this was a huge leap forward in the industry.

==Uses==
There are a variety of clinically useful ergoline derivatives for the purpose of vasoconstriction, the treatment of migraines, and treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. Ergoline alkaloids found their place in pharmacology long before modern medicine as preparations of ergot were often used by midwives in the 12th century to stimulate childbirth. Following Arthur Stoll&#x27;s isolation of ergometrine, the therapeutic use of ergoline derivatives became well explored.

The induction of uterine contractions via the preparation of ergot was attributed to ergonovine, an ergoline derivative found in ergot, which is a powerful oxytocic. From this, methergine, a synthetic derivative, was elucidated. While used to facilitate child birth, ergoline derivatives can pass into breast milk and should not be used during breastfeeding. They are uterine contractors that can increase the risk of miscarriage during pregnancy.

Another example of medically relevant ergoline alkaloids is ergotamine, an alkaloid also found in ergot. It acts as a vasoconstrictor and has been reported to control migraines. From ergotamine, the anti-migraine drugs dihydroergotamine and methysergide were developed by Albert Hofmann.

Ergoline derivatives, such as hydergine, a mixture of dihydroergotoxine mesylates or ergoline mesylates, have also been used in the treatment of dementia. The use of these alkaloids in the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease has also been prominent. Drugs such as bromocriptine act as a dopamine receptor agonist, stimulating the nerves that control movement. Newer synthetic ergoline derivatives that have been synthesized for the treatment of Parkinson&#x27;s disease include pergolide and lisuride, which both act as dopamine agonists as well.

A famous ergoline derivative is the psychedelic drug LSD, a semi-synthetic ergoline alkaloid that was discovered by Albert Hofmann. LSD is considered a Schedule I controlled substance. Ergometrine and ergotamine are included as schedule I precursors in the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/list/red.pdf2&quot;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
The mechanism of ergoline alkaloids varies for each derivative. A variety of modifications can be made to the ergoline skeleton to produce medically relevant derivatives. Types of potential ergoline-based drugs include dopaminergic, antidopaminergic, serotonergic, and antiserotonergic. Ergoline alkaloids often interfere with multiple receptor sites, leading to negative side effects and adding to the challenge of drug development.

=== Dopaminergic/antidopaminergic ===
Ergolines, such as ergotoxin, have been reported to inhibit the deciduoma reaction, which is reversed through injection of progesterone. Thus, it was concluded that ergotoxin, and related ergolines, act via the hypothalamus and pituitary gland to inhibit the secretion of prolactin. Drugs such as bromocriptine interact with the dopaminergic receptor sites as agonists with selectivity for D2 receptors, making them effective in treating Parkinson&#x27;s disease. While the part of the ergoline alkaloid structure responsible for dopaminergic properties has yet to be identified, some reason that it is due to the pyroleethylamine moiety while others assert that it is due to the indoleethylamine partial structure.

Antidopaminergic ergolines have found use in antiemetics and in the treatment of schizophrenia. These substances are neuroleptic and are either an antagonist of dopamine at the postsynaptic level at the D2 receptor site or an agonist of dopamine at the presynaptic level at the D1 receptor site. The antagonist or agonist behavior of the ergolines are substrate dependent and mixed agonist/antagonist behaviors of ergoline derivatives have been reported.

=== Serotonergic/antiserotonergic ===
The primary challenges of developing serotonergic/antiserotonergic ergolines is attributed to serotonin, or 5-HT, acting on various distinct receptor sites. Similarly, ergoline alkaloids have been shown to exhibit both 5-HT agonist and antagonist behaviors for multiple receptors, such as metergoline, a 5-HT1A agonist/5-HT2A antagonist, and mesulergine, a 5-HT2A/2C antagonist. The selectivity and affinity of ergolines for certain 5-HT receptors can be improved by introducing a bulky group on the phenyl ring of the ergoline skeleton, which would prevent the interaction of ergoline derivatives with receptors. This methodology has been used to develop selective 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A ergolines in particular.

==Ergoline derivatives==
There are three main classes of ergoline derivatives, or &quot;substituted ergolines&quot;: (1) the water-soluble amides of &quot;lysergic acid&quot; (i.e., lysergamides); (2) the water-insoluble &quot;ergopeptines&quot; (i.e., &quot;ergopeptides&quot;); and (3) the &quot;clavine&quot; group. Only the lysergamides have been known to have psychedelic effects.

The relationship between these compounds is summarized in the following structural formula and table of substitutions.



===Peptide alkaloids===
Peptide ergot alkaloids or ergopeptines (also known as &quot;ergopeptides&quot;) are ergoline derivatives that contain a tripeptide structure attached to the basic ergoline ring in the same location as the amide group of the lysergic acid derivatives. This structure consists of proline and two other α-amino acids, linked in an unusual cyclol formation &gt;N-C(OH)&lt; with the carboxyl carbon of proline, at the juncture between the two lactam rings. Some of the important ergopeptines are summarized below. In addition to the following ergopeptines, a commonly encountered term is ergotoxine, which refers to a mixture of equal proportions of ergocristine, ergocornine and ergocryptine, the latter being a 2:1 mixture of &quot;alpha&quot;- and &quot;beta&quot;-ergocryptine. Ergopeptines are considered to be the most toxic and are capable of inducing gangrene: “The low molecular ergolines are lacking the complex peptide moiety, which is apparently responsible for the persistence of the ergopeptines at the receptor molecules.”

<doc id="621513" wikidata="Q213495" url="?curid=621513" title="Boyzone">
<text>Boyzone was an Irish boy band created in 1993 by the talent manager Louis Walsh. Before even recording any material, Boyzone made an appearance on RTÉ&#x27;s &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. Its most successful line-up was composed of Keith Duffy, Stephen Gately, Mikey Graham, Ronan Keating, and Shane Lynch. As of 2018, Boyzone had released seven studio albums and nine compilation albums.

In 2012, the Official Charts Company revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history, with Boyzone currently placed at 29th and the second most successful boy band in Britain, behind Take That. According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Boyzone has been certified for sales of 6.4 million albums and 8.4 million singles in the UK, with 25 million records sold by 2013 worldwide. Boyzone have had six UK No.1 singles and nine No.1 singles in Ireland. Of the 24 singles they released in the UK, 21 entered the top 40 (including 18 in the top 10 and 12 in the top 2) in the UK charts and 22 singles (including 19 in the top 5) in the Irish charts. They have had five No. 1 albums in the UK. 

Boyzone split in 1999, but made a comeback in 2007, originally with the intention of just touring. Gately died on 10 October 2009 of a congenital heart defect while on holiday in the Spanish island of Majorca. Boyzone went on tour in late 2018 to celebrate their 25th anniversary. An album to celebrate the anniversary was released on 16 November 2018. On 28 April 2018, it was announced that the band would split after their anniversary celebrations, which ended in 2019.

==History==
===Breakthrough and &quot;Said and Done&quot; (1993–1995)===
In 1993, an advertisement appeared in Irish newspapers calling for auditions to form a new Irish &quot;boy band&quot; group. The advertisements were sent out by theatrical manager Louis Walsh who was looking to make an &quot;Irish Take That&quot; following on from that band&#x27;s success. The auditions were held in The Ormond Centre, in Dublin, in November 1993. More than 300 people replied to the advertisement. At the auditions the applicants were asked to sing the song &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; by George Michael. Each audition would be taped and watched again to judge the applicant&#x27;s performance. Out of the 300, 50 were selected for a second audition. For the second audition the applicants where asked to sing two songs, including one of their own choice with a backing tape. Mikey Graham sang &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; by Meat Loaf, Keith Duffy sang &quot;I&#x27;m Too Sexy&quot; by Right Said Fred, Ronan Keating sang &quot;Father and Son&quot; by Cat Stevens (a cover version of which the band would later release), and Stephen Gately sang &quot;Hello&quot; by Lionel Richie. Out of this 50, 10 were selected for a third audition. In the end, Keating, Gately, Duffy, Richard Rock (son of Dickie Rock), Shane Lynch and Mark Walton were chosen. This lineup of the group were mocked by both the audience and presenter Gay Byrne in an appearance on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1993, where they mimed and danced to the Clubhouse hit &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Graham originally was rejected but later joined after Rock&#x27;s departure.

Boyzone played through 1994 in pubs and clubs all over Northern Ireland before PolyGram signed them up in 1994 and released the cover version of the Four Seasons&#x27; hit &quot;Working My Way Back to You&quot;, featuring Graham and Gately on lead vocals. It reached No. 3 in the Irish Charts. The release of their cover version of the classic Johnny Bristol song, &quot;Love Me for a Reason&quot;, broke into the British charts. The song hit No. 2 in the UK and was included in their 1995 hit debut album, &quot;Said and Done&quot;. The album reached the No. 1 spot in Ireland and the UK. In 1995, the singles &quot;Key to My Life&quot;, &quot;So Good&quot; and &quot;Father and Son&quot; were released, which all got the attention of new fans in Europe.

===&quot;A Different Beat&quot; and &quot;Where We Belong&quot; (1996–1998)===
Their second album, &quot;A Different Beat&quot;, was released in 1996. This album brought the band worldwide success, and sold 2 million copies worldwide. The song &quot;Coming Home Now&quot; was released as a single. Boyzone had their first UK No. 1 single, a cover of the Bee Gees&#x27; hit &quot;Words&quot;. The album also contained the hit singles &quot;A Different Beat&quot; and &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Wonder&quot;. In 1997, Boyzone released three singles: &quot;Isn&#x27;t It a Wonder&quot;, &quot;Picture of You&quot;, and &quot;Baby Can I Hold You/Shooting Star&quot;. The group performed &quot;Let The Message Run Free&quot; at the Eurovision Song Contest 1997, co-hosted by Keating, in Dublin and tried to break the US market with their version of &quot;Mystical Experience&quot;, which they also recorded in Spanish. Ronan Keating – who by now had emerged as the lead singer and frontman – won the Ivor Novello Award for songwriting in 1997 for &quot;Picture of You&quot;.

Their third studio album, &quot;Where We Belong&quot;, was released in 1998 and featured Boyzone&#x27;s writing abilities; the album sold over 3 million copies worldwide. It contained the hit singles &quot;All That I Need&quot; (which stayed for six weeks in the MTV Asia charts), &quot;Baby Can I Hold You&quot; (Tracy Chapman cover) and &quot;No Matter What&quot;.

Originally written for the Andrew Lloyd Webber stage musical &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, &quot;No Matter What&quot; was the group&#x27;s best ever selling single selling over 4 million copies worldwide and it is the biggest selling record for a boy band, it was also voted Song of the Year, 1998. Since the song was also recorded by Meat Loaf, Boyzone shared the stage with him to perform the song during his 1998 live concert in Dublin. They also sang the song in Italy with Luciano Pavarotti. Their 1998 tour of Ireland broke all sales records when 35,000 tickets were sold out in four hours.

===&quot;By Request&quot; and hiatus (1999–2007)===

In 1999, &quot;When the Going Gets Tough&quot;, &quot;You Needed Me&quot; and &quot;Every Day I Love You&quot; were singles released which were worldwide hits. As well as their greatest hits compilation &quot;By Request&quot;—the highest-selling Boyzone album, having sold over 4 million copies worldwide—a tour followed from May–July 1999 in Ireland, the UK and Europe. In June 1999, Stephen Gately revealed that he was gay and was in love with the ex-Caught in the Act member Eloy de Jong. Also during this year Keating released his first solo single, &quot;When You Say Nothing at All&quot;, an Alison Krauss song which he had recorded for the movie &quot;Notting Hill&quot;. In November 1999, after six years together and amid growing tensions behind the scenes, the group members decided to take some time off from Boyzone to pursue solo projects. Boyzone performed together for the last time in Ireland at the point depot during nine dates running from 3–8 January and 10–12 January 2000. They had sold more than 20 million records in total and all 16 of their singles reached the UK top five, making them the first Irish act to have four No. 1 hits in the United Kingdom charts.

For seven years after their split, the members had mixed success in their individual careers. Keating in particular remained a force in the music industry as he continued writing and managing other bands. Gately also continued his career as a solo artist, appearing in a number of West End stage musicals, and Duffy had some success as an actor, including a role in the UK television soap &quot;Coronation Street&quot;. Rumours came to a head and in early 2007 there were news reports that all five members and their manager, &quot;The X Factor&quot; judge Walsh, had met in Dublin to discuss and organise a comeback tour. On 11 October 2007, Walsh was interviewed on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;; when asked by Norton whether there was going to be a re-launch of Boyzone he replied &quot;I think so&quot;. On 5 November 2007, Keating confirmed that Boyzone would reunite for a special appearance on the BBC&#x27;s annual fundraiser, &quot;Children in Need&quot;, performing a medley of hits, although had not yet commented on the possibility of a new tour or album. On 14 November 2007, it was reported that all five members of Boyzone were to begin a UK tour in May, which would be their first in seven years. Keating, who left the group to pursue a solo career, joined them for the series of concerts. On 16 November, Boyzone made a comeback appearance as part of &quot;Children in Need&quot; on BBC1 in the UK, with an Irish and UK tour announced for June 2008.

===&quot;Back Again... No Matter What&quot; tour and Gately&#x27;s death (2008–2009)===

The group sold 200,000 tickets for the tour within three hours and sold 20,000 tickets on the first day of them going on sale for their concert in the RDS Dublin. Keating told the &quot;Daily Star&quot;: &quot;We&#x27;ve been taking it easy on the Guinness and been out for dinners and just a couple of drinks. We&#x27;re taking the tour plans very seriously. We&#x27;re all on diets and we&#x27;ve been training in the gym every day. I&#x27;m probably the fittest now that I&#x27;ve ever been. I think we all look better now than before. I can&#x27;t wait to be back on the road and all the guys feel the same.&quot; The 29-date tour, taking in cities such as Cardiff, Newcastle, Liverpool, London at the O2 Arena and Wembley, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Sheffield, Newcastle, Nottingham, Edinburgh Castle and the RDS in Dublin.

The tour began on 25 May 2008 at Belfast&#x27;s Odyssey arena and finished at Carlisle Bitts Park on 23 August 2008. On 29 August 2008 Boyzone played alongside other acts such as Sandi Thom and Scouting For Girls at an event in Blackpool to switch on the Blackpool Illuminations, an annual event in the town. The event received coverage on BBC Radio 2. On 3 September, the video for Love You Anyway debuted on the digital music channel The Box. It features all five members of the best-known lineup of Boyzone with Keating taking most of the lead vocals. The single received its first play on 20 August 2008, live on Terry Wogan&#x27;s Radio 2 Breakfast show. On 6 October 2008, &quot;Love You Anyway&quot; entered the UK charts at No. 5, making it their 17th consecutive top five single. On 8 December their second single of 2008 &quot;Better&quot; was released and charted at No. 22 in the UK charts, No. 26 in the Irish charts and N. 63 in the European hot singles charts. On 28 August 2009 the group joined Yvette Fielding in Edinburgh for a &quot;Ghosthunting with...&quot; show for ITV2.

In 2009, Boyzone played their Better Tour, which was the last tour to feature Gately. On 10 October 2009, Gately died suddenly at his flat in Port d&#x27;Andratx, Majorca. Gately&#x27;s bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009; Walsh was expected to join them soon after. The surviving members of Boyzone, Keith Duffy, Mikey Graham, Ronan Keating and Shane Lynch, issued a joint statement: Post-mortem and toxicology tests took place on 13 October and showed that Gately died from a pulmonary edema resulting from an undiagnosed heart condition.

On 16 October, accompanied by the four surviving members of Boyzone, his body was brought from Majorca to Dublin where his funeral took place at the Church of St Laurence O&#x27;Toole the following day.

Fans responded with messages of sympathy on the social media. Boyzone manager Louis Walsh was quoted as saying: &quot;We&#x27;re all absolutely devastated. I&#x27;m in complete shock. I was only with him on Monday at an awards ceremony. We don&#x27;t know much about what&#x27;s happened yet. I only heard after &quot;The X Factor&quot; (UK television talent show on which Walsh is a judge) and we will rally around each other this week. He was a great man.&quot;

===&quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;BZ20&quot; (2010–2013)===
The four surviving Boyzone members were originally going to release the new album in mid-2010 with a summer tour following the album, but the album was released in March 2010 which was earlier than planned. The album was released as a tribute to Gately which included two new songs that were performed by Gately before his death. One song was written by singer-songwriter Mika, who has also claimed that the new song he wrote for Boyzone is the last one which will feature Gately&#x27;s vocals in which he and Keating shared the vocals and originally the song would have led to Ronan singing first then Stephen would sing the second part prior to that, the song was released as their fourth studio album on 8 March 2010. The track written by Mika became the lead single from the new album, titled &quot;Gave It All Away&quot;. Graham stated that &quot;Gave It All Away&quot; would be released on 1 March 2010 and the album was released a week afterwards. To date, the single has sold over 130,000 copies in the UK alone. The single charted in Australia and New Zealand and peaked at No. 9 on the UK Singles Chart and at No. 1 on the Irish Singles Chart.

Boyzone&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Brother&quot;, was released on 8 March 2010 and became their fourth studio number one album so far in both Ireland and the UK selling 400,000 copies in the UK, 30,000 copies in Republic of Ireland and 7,000 in Germany, the album also charted in several other European countries, Australia and in the top ten in New Zealand. It has sold over 600,000 copies worldwide as of 2012. &quot;Love Is a Hurricane&quot; was the second and final single from &quot;Brother&quot;. It was released on 17 May, peaking at No. 44 on the UK Singles Chart and at No. 39 on the Irish Singles Chart, selling 12,000 copies. In mid-2010, it was announced that they would be touring the UK and Ireland during February and March 2011 with a 21 date tour of Ireland and UK with their arena-based Brother Tour and four outdoor shows around the UK during August, the tour was seen by 160,000 fans and the tour grossed million in total. A Huge contribution to the background and lead vocals in their tours since 2011 has come from backing vocalist Jo Garland who has sung with Ronan Keating in his solo ventures since 2001 and with Boyzone since 2008, her vocals have been more prominent often covering for vocals that Stephen Gately sung. A DVD of the tour from The O2 Arena will be released in December 2013. Boyzone performed &quot;No Matter What&quot; with Kym Marsh on an ITV programme called &quot;Coronation Street: The Big 50&quot;, broadcast on ITV1 on 10 December 2010, but Graham was not present due to other commitments.

Lynch said in an interview on ITV1 show Loose Women that Boyzone will be releasing a new album and be touring in 2013 which will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the band forming. Duffy told The Sun newspaper: &quot;We&#x27;ve plans in place for a tour and an album next year for the 20th anniversary - that&#x27;s if people want to come and see us!&quot;
 Tickets for the anniversary tour BZ20 went on sale on 14 February 2013, the tour was released in a cd format and include the DVD of their 2011 tour which has been held back from release until December 2013. As part of the 20th anniversary the band recorded a programme on 12 June 2013 which aired on Irish channel RTÉ One on 27 August called &quot;Boyzone - For One Night Only&quot;. On 24 September 2013, the band performed one of the songs from their new album called &quot;Love Will Save the Day&quot; on &quot;The X Factor Australia&quot;. It was announced on the same day that the brand new album will be released on 25 November 2013 and became available to pre-order from Amazon. Boyzone released their new studio album &quot;BZ20&quot; in November 2013 and it sold 200,000 copies in the UK, peaking at number 6 in the UK charts and number 7 in the Irish charts. &quot;Love Will save The Day&quot; was released a week previously and peaked at number 39 in the UK charts selling 20,000 copies.

===&quot;From Dublin to Detroit&quot; and Asian/UK festivals (2014–2017)===

In early 2014, a compilation album &quot;Love Me for a Reason: The Collection&quot; was released and it has charted in Ireland and Belgium. In 2014, further dates were added to their BZ20 Tour. On 17 July 2014, it was announced that Boyzone would be releasing a sixth studio album called &quot;From Dublin To Detroit&quot;, a 12-song album with covers of motown hits. Keith Duffy said &quot;We&#x27;re basically just covering some of our favourite songs from the Motown era, and putting a full album together. So we&#x27;ve got 12 really exciting tracks coming out. It&#x27;s going to give us a whole new catalogue of music to perform. And it will be very interesting how it fits in with our own back catalogue. It&#x27;s kind of rejuvenating us. It&#x27;s giving us just good times and good memories in the studio. So fingers crossed people will receive it well and it goes well for us.&quot; On 29 September 2014 a few songs from the album were announced on Twitter; Upon release, the album Dublin to Detroit featured 11 songs with a deluxe version having an extra 2 songs. The album sold 90,000 copies in the UK. In 2015, Boyzone toured Asia, England and Scotland with 12 dates.
Boyzone toured the UK in late summer of 2017 along with 4 outdoor dates in Chelmsford City Racecourse, Derby County Cricket Ground, Hastings Pier and Windsor Racecourse.

===&quot;Thank You &amp; Goodnight&quot; and anniversaries (2018–2023)===

In December 2017, it was announced that the album had been finalized and was ready for release in 2018.
In April 2018, it was confirmed that Boyzone would release a new studio album in September and tour the UK in 2018 with arena shows. Keith Duffy announced in March 2017 that Boyzone had signed a contract with Warner Music for an album and an arena tour. The album was titled &quot;Thank You &amp; Goodnight&quot;.

The album was released on 16 November 2018 by Warner Music and peaked at number 10 in Ireland and 6 in the UK. Shane Lynch compared the album&#x27;s style to that of American singer Charlie Puth, and both Sam Smith and Ed Sheeran wrote some material for the album.

It was speculated that the band would re-form for their 30th anniversary in 2023 with a new album and tour. However, Keating has since ruled this out, citing band member Gately&#x27;s death as the reason.

==Publication history==
There were two editions. The first was published by FanTac Games (1977) and the second by Fantasy Games Unlimited (1980). Both versions include artwork by David C. Sutherland III.

The FanTac version of the game included conversion rules for the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Metamorphosis Alpha. These were later removed in the FGU edition.

Stan Johansen created a line of 25mm figures for Space Marines, some of which are still in production as of 2011.

The Space Marines universe became the background to FGU&#x27;s Space Opera role-playing game.

==Reception==
Lynn Willis reviewed the Fantac version of &quot;Space Marines&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 13. Willis commented that &quot;&quot;Space Marines&quot; presents a superior version of what we already have.&quot;

Mike Hodson-Smith reviewed the Fantac version of &quot;Space Marines&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #8, and stated that &quot;the games played were realistic and very enjoyable and well worth the while.&quot;

William A. Barton reviewed the FGU version of &quot;Space Marines&quot; in &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; No. 34. Barton commented that &quot;if detail and realism without any sacrifice of playability is what you&#x27;re looking for in a SF miniatures rulebook, you won&#x27;t be going wrong by adding &quot;Space Marines&quot; to your collection.&quot;

<text>Ham Hill is a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Scheduled Ancient Monument, Iron Age hill fort, Roman site, Local Nature Reserve and country park, to the west of Yeovil in Somerset, England.

The hill has given its name to the distinctive quarried hamstone and also to two nearby villages: Stoke-sub-Hamdon and Norton Sub Hamdon, whose names mean &quot;under-Ham-hill&quot; (where &quot;Ham&quot; is Old English for a small settlement).
The Mendip Hills, Blackdown Hills, Quantock Hills and Dorset Downs are all visible from Ham Hill, especially from its war memorial. It is popular for picnicking, walking and mountain biking in the grassy hollows of the old quarry workings.

The geology supports a wide range of fauna including mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians living on lichens, fungi, ferns and flowering plants.

== Geology ==

The hill is part of a ridge of sandy limestone rock which is elevated above the lower lying clay vales and nearby Somerset Levels. The sedimentary rocks were laid down in the part of the early Jurassic known as the Toarcian Stage. They are given their colour by the weathering of the iron content of the stone and contain fossils such as the ammonite Dumortieria moorei.

The hamstone is a distinctive honey-coloured building stone which has been used in many local villages and for buildings such as Montacute House and Sherborne Abbey. Extensive old quarry workings have changed the landscape into a warren of stony ridges and grassy hollows. Quarrying has unearthed many important historical artefacts, but also destroyed much of the archaeological context.

11.1 ha of the hill is designated as a geological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), notified in 1971, due to its particular importance to geologists because of the assemblages of fossils which it contains, the sedimentary features which it displays and the way it relates to other rocks of equivalent age in the close vicinity.

==Ecology==

Ham Hill is managed as a Local Nature Reserve, under Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, because of the rare calcareous grassland which supports a wide variety of plant and animal species and its wild flower meadows and wide open grassland areas such as Witcombe Valley.

Fauna include mammals, birds, invertebrates, reptiles and amphibians while the flora include lichens, fungi, ferns and flowering plants.

==History==

The name may come from the Old English &quot;ham&quot; and &quot;hyll&quot; giving a meaning of &quot;the settlement hill&quot;, however its original name was Hamdon, meaning &quot;the hill among the water meadows&quot;. There is evidence of occupation from the mesolithic and neolithic periods. Ham Hill is the site of a very large Bronze Age and Iron Age hill fort of the Durotriges tribe, from the 1st century BC. The ramparts enclose an area of . Most of the perimeter is a double bank and ditch (&quot;multivallate&quot;). There is a major entrance to the south-east, on the line of the modern road and another to the north-east, following a track from the Church of St Mary the Virgin at East Stoke in Stoke-sub-Hamdon. Archaeological finds include bronzework, chariot parts, iron currency bars, gold and silver coins, cremations and burials.

The hill was captured around AD 45 by the Roman Second Legion (Augusta), led by the future emperor Vespasian, who had already captured Maiden Castle and other hill forts to the south. Many Roman military artefacts have been found and it is quite likely that the Second Legion made a temporary camp on the hill, as at Hod Hill. After the initial campaigns, a more permanent Roman camp was established at nearby Ilchester and the Fosse Way military road was constructed within of Ham Hill, on its way to Axminster and the garrison at Exeter. The area was very prosperous in the Roman period and several major villas have been found nearby, including one on the eastern part of the hill in the field known as &quot;Warren&quot;, with extensive mosaic. Other villas have been found at Stoke-sub-Hamdon, Odcombe, Lufton and West Coker. Just to the east of the main plateau is the isolated St. Michael&#x27;s Hill, the &quot;pointed hill&quot; that gives its name to the village of Montacute and which was turned into a motte-and-bailey castle by the Normans.

South of the main hill are strip lynchets, or low terraces created by ancient ploughing and cultivation and the deserted medieval village of Witcombe (or Whitcombe), which was finally abandoned in the 17th century.

In the 1800s there were 24 small quarries operating on the hill employing some 200 men. This continued into the Victorian era with over 200 small family run quarries and masonry businesses. Many of these small quarries had ceased working by 1910. Today hamstone is only quarried in two areas at the top of Ham Hill. The North quarry, near the modern stone circle and war memorial, is the longest running hamstone quarry in existence. The southern, Norton Quarry extracts its stone from some 20–30 metres below the surface and is quarried by Harvey Stone. This quarry was reopened around 15 years ago, having been the last quarry abandoned in the 1930s due to there being, according to the masons working the hill &quot;no good quality stone left&quot;. Both quarries are owned by the Duchy of Cornwall.

The northern end of the plateau is crowned by a war memorial to the dead of the nearby village of Stoke-sub-Hamdon killed during the two World Wars and subsequent conflicts. It was designed in 1920 and unveiled in 1923 with four steps which lead to a square plinth and a tapering four-sided obelisk with a flat top. The memorial is clearly visible from the surrounding countryside, including the A303 trunk road which now follows the course of the Fosse Way near the base of the hill. Just below the Monument is a bench dedicated to the memory of local student Alan Kneebone, who was murdered in 2001 while at Wakefield College.

== Recreation ==

The hill and the country park around it provide a venue for a variety of leisure and recreational uses, including walking, horse riding, mountain biking and orienteering. It is very popular with dog walkers. It is the end of the Leland trail, a footpath which runs from King Alfred&#x27;s Tower to Ham Hill Country Park.

There is a limited amount of climbing available at Ham Hill with roughly 20 routes. These are top roped routes due to the nature of the rock, the difficulty of &quot;topping out&quot; and because the rock is of geological interest. There are also several bouldering problems.

There are two compass trails for orienteering: one in the stone circle area and one in Witcombe Valley. They are marked by sets of letters printed on small squares from A to J, which are attached to fence posts, signposts, gates and boulders.

Ham Hill is close to the Monarch&#x27;s Way a long-distance footpath which approximates the escape route taken by King Charles II in 1651, after being defeated at the Battle of Worcester. and the start of the Liberty Trail which covers to Lyme Regis in Dorset.

==Country Park==

Ham Hill is operated as a country park by South Somerset District Council and is visited by over 250,000 people each year.

Prior to the designation of Ham Hill as a country park, three local farms used ancient free range grazing rights on the main grass area of the hill. Country Park status brought more visitors and most importantly, more dogs. The dogs made the grazing of sheep impossible. This has resulted in a noticeable change in vegetation in the last forty years. In many areas, what were areas of short-cropped grassland interspersed with short stemmed plants such as wild thyme and clovers have been replaced by rank bracken, gorse, bramble and wild parsley. The absence of the sheep has also enabled woodland to overrun and obscure the previously grassed Iron Age earthworks, most noticeably on the northern flank of the hill. A disastrous fire on the south-west flank of the hill (overlooking Little Norton) in the drought summer of 1976 was believed to have been caused by a discarded cigarette. The vegetation on the entire side of the hill was destroyed. When regrowth appeared, bracken was the dominant vegetation. In some places this has now given way to woodland, but the fine grassland of before the fire has not returned.

Other changes are due to farming habits. In previous years the plateau fields were almost exclusively used for grazing or growing spring wheat and left fallow during the winter. In some years the fields were lightly ploughed and mangolds grown for winter fodder. Following a change in ownership during the 1980s, this changed to winter-sown grain with deep ploughing with sludge injection. The change caused an immediate change to the wildlife. The winter flocks of finches were lost, the yellowhammers disappeared, the skylarks nearly so. The deep ploughing proved counter productive as millions of poppy seeds were brought to the surface making the grain difficult to harvest - something that had been warned of years earlier by a previous farmer, but disregarded. It was around this time that deep ploughing probably damaged the remains of the Roman mosaic at Batemore; the site was ploughed over (it had never been marked on the ground) and small pieces of tile were brought to the surface. The plateau fields are now under the control of the park authorities, who are attempting to restore them by allowing natural grassland regrowth, with controlled sheep grazing.

<doc id="621522" wikidata="Q1513654" url="?curid=621522" title="Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)">
<text>&quot;Stand by Me&quot; is a song originally performed in 1961 by American singer-songwriter Ben E. King and written by him, along with Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, who together used the pseudonym Elmo Glick. According to King, the title is derived from, and was inspired by, a spiritual written by Sam Cooke and J. W. Alexander called &quot;Stand by Me Father&quot;, recorded by the Soul Stirrers with Johnnie Taylor singing lead. 

&quot;Stand by Me&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1986 film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;, and a corresponding music video, featuring King along with actors River Phoenix and Wil Wheaton, was released to promote the film. The song was also featured in a 1987 European commercial of Levi&#x27;s 501 jeans, contributing to greater success in Europe. In 2012, its royalties were estimated to have topped $22.8 million (£17 million), making it the sixth highest-earning song of its era. 50% of the royalties were paid to King. In 2015, King&#x27;s original version was inducted into the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;, just under five weeks before his death. Later in the year, the 2015 lineup of the Drifters recorded it in tribute.

There have been over 400 recorded versions of the song, performed by many artists, notably Otis Redding, John Lennon, Demis Roussos, Muhammad Ali, 4 the Cause, Tracy Chapman, musicians of the Playing for Change project, Florence and the Machine, Weezer, and the Kingdom Choir. In 2018 it was performed by Maria José, former member of the band Kabah.

==Writing and recording==

In 1960, Ben E. King was inspired to update the early 20th-century gospel hymn &quot;Stand by Me&quot; by Charles Albert Tindley, which was based on Psalm 46, &quot;will not we fear, though the Earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.&quot; According to the documentary &quot;History of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, King had no intention of recording the song himself. King had written it for the Drifters, who passed on recording it. After the &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot; recording session in 1960, King had some studio time left over. The session&#x27;s producers, Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, asked if he had any more songs. King played it on the piano for them. They liked it and called the studio musicians back in to record it.

Stoller recalls it differently: 
I remember arriving at our office as Jerry and Ben were working on lyrics for a new song. King had the beginnings of a melody that he was singing &quot;a cappella&quot;. I went to the piano and worked up the harmonies, developing a bass pattern that became the signature of the song. Ben and Jerry quickly finished the lyrics ... .

In another interview, Stoller said:
Ben E. had the beginnings of a song—both words and music. He worked on the lyrics together with Jerry, and I added elements to the music, particularly the bass line. To some degree, it&#x27;s based on a gospel song called &quot;Lord Stand By Me&quot;. I have a feeling that Jerry and Ben E. were inspired by it. Ben, of course, had a strong background in church music. He&#x27;s a 50% writer on the song, and Jerry and I are 25% each... When I walked in, Jerry and Ben E. were working on the lyrics to a song. They were at an old oak desk we had in the office. Jerry was sitting behind it, and Benny was sitting on the top. They looked up and said they were writing a song. I said, &quot;Let me hear it.&quot;... Ben began to sing the song a cappella. I went over to the upright piano and found the chord changes behind the melody he was singing. It was in the key of A. Then I created a bass line. Jerry said, &quot;Man that&#x27;s it!&quot; We used my bass pattern for a starting point and, later, we used it as the basis for the string arrangement created by Stanley Applebaum.

The personnel on the song included Romeo Penque on sax, Ernie Hayes on piano, Al Caiola and Charles McCracken on guitars, Lloyd Trotman on double bass, Phil Kraus on percussion, and Gary Chester on drums, plus a wordless mixed chorus and strings. Songwriting credits on the single were shown as King and Elmo Glick—a pseudonym used by Leiber and Stoller.

===Structure===
The song uses a version of the common chord progression now called the &#x27;50s progression, which has been called the &quot;&#x27;Stand by Me&#x27; changes&quot; after the song.

==Release and reception==
King&#x27;s record went to number 1 on the R&amp;B charts and was a Top Ten hit on the US charts twice—in its original release, entering the Billboard chart on May 13, 1961 and peaking at number 4 on June 16, 1961, and a 1986 re-release coinciding with its use as the theme song for the film of the same name following its appearance in the film, when it peaked at number 9 on December 20, 1986 – January 3, 1987. The song is also heard in the televised advertisement of Levi&#x27;s 501 jeans. In the commercial, a man wearing a black denim jeans is able to enter a nightclub whose policy is &quot;no blue jeans&quot;. &quot;Stand by Me&quot; also topped the charts in Canada, Ireland, and the United Kingdom upon its re-release. In the latter country, the song topped the UK Singles Chart in January 1987, mostly because of the jeans TV commercial, originally peaking at number 27 on the UK Singles Chart on its original release in Britain in 1961. Originally &quot;Stand by Me&quot; was not released on an album until it had been out as a single for over a year, eventually appearing on King&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Play That Song!&quot; album in 1962.

&quot;Stand by Me&quot; was ranked 122nd on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1999, BMI named it as the fourth most-performed song of the 20th century, with about seven million performances. On March 27, 2012, the Songwriters Hall of Fame announced that the song would receive its 2012 Towering Song Award and that King would be honored with the 2012 Towering Performance Award for his recording of it. In February 2019, the Smooth Radio network in the United Kingdom called it one &quot;of the best love songs of the 1960s&quot;.

&quot;Stand by Me&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Chart performance==
For the year-end charts in the US, the song was the number 63 song of 1961 and number 67 of 1987.

==John Lennon version==


John Lennon recorded his version of the song for his 1975 album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. Lennon&#x27;s remake became a single three weeks after the album&#x27;s release and was his last hit prior to his five-year retirement from the music industry. Lennon filmed a performance of the song for &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; in 1975. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said of it that &quot;John&#x27;s serenading guitar chords herald this bright new production of one of rockdom&#x27;s favorites,&quot; and that it displays Lennon&#x27;s &quot;magical, mysterious voice...at his finest.&quot;

On the week of May 3, 1975, this version was in its second of two weeks at the peak position number 20 on the US Hot 100, right in front of King&#x27;s comeback hit &quot;Supernatural Thing – Part I&quot; at number 21. Both tunes fell off the top 40 the next week and off the chart the week after that. Lennon&#x27;s version stayed on top 100 of the UK Singles Chart for seven weeks, peaking at number 30 on its fourth week on the week of May 18–24, 1975. It peaked at number 13 on Canada&#x27;s &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart on the week ending May 3, 1975 and stayed on the peak position the following week. It peaked at number 11 on the Official New Zealand Music Chart on the week of July 14, 1975.

The single&#x27;s B-side track is &quot;Move Over Ms. L&quot;, initially intended for Lennon&#x27;s previous album &quot;Walls and Bridges&quot; but was cut from the final lineup due to his dissatisfaction with his early takes. Keith Moon covered &quot;Move Over Ms. L&quot; for his 1975 solo album &quot;Two Sides of the Moon&quot;.

Before the parent album&#x27;s official release, during Lennon&#x27;s March 1974 sessions with Harry Nilsson for Nilsson&#x27;s album &quot;Pussy Cats&quot;, Lennon recorded two takes of the song in collaboration with former Beatles member Paul McCartney. McCartney performed on the drums; Lennon on guitar. The unreleased recordings would eventually be included in a bootleg album &quot;A Toot and a Snore in &#x27;74&quot;.

&quot;Billboard&quot; regarded Lennon&#x27;s version as &quot;the best version since the original.&quot; &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Marc Hogan found Lennon&#x27;s version &quot;more affecting (just barely)&quot; than the original due to the &quot;acoustic guitar and Lennon&#x27;s fervent vocals&quot;. A 2007 book &quot;The Words and Music of John Lennon&quot; by Ben Urish and Ken Bielen called Lennon&#x27;s version one of the &quot;stronger&quot; tracks of the album. Journalist and book author Robert Webb in 2013 called this version one of the &quot;greatest cover versions&quot;.

==Mickey Gilley version==
Mickey Gilley released his version of the song in 1980, and it was included in the movie &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot;. It was his eighth No. 1 on the US country charts and also reached No. 22 on the US Hot 100. This version also peaked at No. 3 in Canadian &quot;RPM&quot; Country Singles in September 1980 and No. 51 in &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles the following month. The song would &quot;become one of Gilley&#x27;s signature songs.&quot;

==Playing for Change version==

Documentary filmmaker Mark Johnson, who had created the Playing for Change project, witnessed street performer Roger Ridley singing &quot;Stand by Me&quot; in Santa Monica, California, in March 2005. Ridley died eight months later.

Johnson was inspired to film Ridley&#x27;s performance and another thirty-six musicians&#x27; individual performances of the song &quot;around the world&quot; and then mix the clips into one music video. The music video was featured in an October 2008 episode of &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;, where Johnson was promoting the documentary film &quot;Playing for Change: Peace Through Music&quot;, which includes the music video and was shown as part of the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City. The music video was uploaded via the Playing for Change YouTube channel in November 2008, garnering more than 10 million views in May 2009. The total amount of views of the YouTube video increased to more than 24 million in December 2010, 30 million in March 2011, 40 million in March 2012, 50 million in some time between 2012 and 2014, 60 million in 2014, 74 million in May 2015, 100 million in 2017, 140 (or 142) million in March 2020, and 190 million in November 2023.

The musicians&#x27; performance of the song would be later included in their 2009 debut album &quot;Songs Around the World&quot;. The debut album has nine other tracks, comes with the seven-track bonus DVD, and sold about 26,000 units on its first week, 85% of sales from online sales and &quot;nontraditional retail stores (including Starbucks locations)&quot; and 25% from outside the United States.

==Prince Royce version==

Prince Royce recorded a bachata version of the song as his debut single, changing parts of the lyrics into Spanish. This version peaked number eight on US Hot Latin Tracks and number one on US Tropical Airplay. At the Latin Grammy Awards of 2010, Royce performed the song live along with Ben E. King. Royce&#x27;s remake received a Lo Nuestro award for &quot;Tropical Song of the Year&quot;. 

Royce performed the song live again at a July 2016 Philips Arena concert in Atlanta, Georgia, alongside a male fan, at a 2017 Amway Center concert in Orlando, Florida, as the second song for the 2019 RodeoHouston concert, and at the third night of the 2020 Democratic National Convention. He also made a dance version for his debut album.

In a 1995 music video entitled &quot;Disney&#x27;s Timon &amp; Pumbaa in &quot;Stand by Me&quot;&quot;, Timon performs the song with slightly altered lyrics, while every time Timon sings the chorus, Pumbaa survives physical mishaps and ferocious creatures. A trio of frogs then finish the song at the end.

===2010s===

Tracy Chapman performed the song live in 2015 in the final season of &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; at Letterman&#x27;s request. The critical and popular response was very positive, with James Christopher Monger of AllMusic praising Chapman&#x27;s &quot;emotionally pitch-perfect, spotlight-stealing rendition&quot; of the song. Monger further said:With just her voice and an electric guitar, she managed to simultaneously bring the house down and build it back up again, which is no small feat, even for an artist who has proven herself time and again to be a powerful yet always benevolent force of nature. A recording of that live performance was released as the final track of Chapman&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; the same year.
Florence and the Machine recorded the song for the soundtrack and trailer of &quot;Final Fantasy XV&quot; in 2016.

<doc id="621523" wikidata="Q415837" url="?curid=621523" title="Lysergic acid">
<text>Lysergic acid, also known as -lysergic acid and (+)-lysergic acid, is a precursor for a wide range of ergoline alkaloids that are produced by the ergot fungus and found in the seeds of &quot;Argyreia nervosa&quot; (Hawaiian baby woodrose), and &quot;Ipomoea&quot; species (morning glories, ololiuhqui, tlitliltzin).

Amides of lysergic acid, lysergamides, are widely used as pharmaceuticals and as psychedelic drugs, e.g. lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Lysergic acid is listed as a Table I precursor under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.

The name Lysergic acid comes from the fact that the this carboxylic acid was first made by hydro[[Lysergic acid|lys]]is of various [[Lysergic acid|erg]]ot alkaloids.

== Synthesis ==
=== Laboratory ===
Lysergic acid is generally produced by hydrolysis of natural lysergamides, but can also be synthesized in the laboratory by a complex total synthesis, for example by Robert Burns Woodward&#x27;s team in 1956. An enantioselective total synthesis based on a palladium-catalyzed domino cyclization reaction has been described in 2011 by Fujii and Ohno. Lysergic acid monohydrate crystallizes in very thin hexagonal leaflets when recrystallized from water. Lysergic acid monohydrate, when dried (140 °C at ) forms anhydrous lysergic acid.

=== Biosynthesis ===
The biosynthetic route is based on the alkylation of the amino acid tryptophan with dimethylallyl diphosphate (isoprene derived from 3&quot;R&quot;-mevalonic acid) giving 4-dimethylallyl--tryptophan which is &quot;N&quot;-methylated with &quot;S&quot;-adenosyl--methionine. Oxidative ring closure followed by decarboxylation, reduction, cyclization, oxidation, and allylic isomerization yields -(+)-lysergic acid. The biosynthetic pathway has been reconsituted in transgenic baker&#x27;s yeast.

==Isomers==
Lysergic acid is a chiral compound with two stereocenters. The isomer with inverted configuration at carbon atom 8 close to the carboxyl group is called isolysergic acid. Inversion at carbon 5 close to the nitrogen atom leads to -lysergic acid and -isolysergic acid, respectively.

== Legality ==

In the United States, Lysergic acid and Lysergic acid amide are Schedule III substances.

<doc id="621524" wikidata="Q2032476" url="?curid=621524" title="Apostille Convention">
<text>The Convention of 5 October 1961 Abolishing the Requirement of Legalisation for Foreign Public Documents, also known as the Apostille Convention, is an international treaty drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH). The Apostille Convention is intended to simplify the procedure through which a document, issued in one of the contracting states, can be certified for legal purposes in the other contracting states of the convention. A certification under the convention is called an apostille or Hague apostille (from French &quot;apostille&quot;, meaning a marginal or bottom note, derived from Latin &quot;post illa&quot;, meaning &quot;after those [words of the text]&quot;). An apostille is an international certification comparable to a notarisation, and may supplement a local notarisation of the document. If the convention applies between two states, an apostille issued by the state of origin is sufficient to certify the document, and removes the need for further certification by the destination state.

==Background==


Many states require the verification of the authenticity of foreign documents, in a procedure called &quot;legalization&quot;, for the document to be legally valid there. This legalization is generally a chain of certifications, by one or more authorities of the state where the document was issued and of the destination state. The first authority certifies the issuer of the document, and each subsequent authority certifies the previous one, until the final certification is made by an authority of the destination state that can be recognized by the final user there. For example, to be accepted in Thailand, a document from the U.S. state of Maryland not issued by a government official must be certified by a notary public, who must then be certified by the clerk of the circuit court in the notary&#x27;s county, who must then be certified by the Maryland Secretary of State, who must then be certified by the U.S. Department of State, which must finally be certified by the Embassy of Thailand in the United States.

In many cases, the legalization procedure is simplified or exempted altogether. For example, some states have agreements eliminating the legalization requirement for certain documents issued by each other, such as between Argentina and Italy, between Brazil and France, between parties of the Convention on the Issue of Multilingual Extracts from Civil Status Records, and between parties of the Convention on Legal Assistance and Legal Relations of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The European Union also has a regulation eliminating the legalization requirement for certain documents of its member states to be accepted by each other. Some states such as Canada, Japan, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States generally accept documents from any state without any certification.

The Apostille Convention, drafted by the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCCH), is intended to simplify the legalization procedure by replacing it with a certification called an apostille, issued by an authority designated by the state of origin. Ideally the apostille would be the only certification needed, but in some cases additional certifications in the state of origin may be required before the apostille is issued. In any case, after the apostille, no certification by the destination state is required.

==Contracting states==
The convention permits certain states to sign and ratify the convention, becoming contracting states. For each of these states, or for an extension to one of its territories, the convention enters into force 60 days after the deposit of its ratification or territorial extension. Other states are also permitted to become contracting states by acceding to the convention, but without signing it. For each of these states, during the period of six months after it deposits its accession, the other contracting states may object to it, and the convention enters into force 60 days after this period, between the acceding state and all other contracting states that did not object to it. Later, if a contracting state withdraws its objection, the convention enters into force between these two states at that time. A successor state of a previous contracting state may declare to continue to be bound by the convention without a waiting period or accede later as a new state.

, 127 states are contracting states of the Apostille Convention.

===Potential accessions===
The governments of Iran, Lebanon, Malaysia and Vietnam have expressed interest in acceding to the Apostille Convention.

==Procedure==
===Eligible documents===
The convention mentions four types of documents eligible for apostilles:
* court documents;
* administrative documents (e.g. vital records);
* notarial acts;
* official certificates which are placed on documents signed by persons in their private capacity, such as official certificates recording the registration of a document or the fact that it was in existence on a certain date and official and notarial authentications of signatures.
However, the Apostille Convention does not apply to documents issued by diplomatic or consular officers, or to administrative documents dealing directly with commercial or customs operations. The reason for this exclusion is that these documents are usually already exempt from legalization.

===Competent authorities===
Each contracting state designates one or more authorities to issue apostilles. Examples of designated authorities are ministries, courts, subnational governments, notaries and registries. In some states, each authority is designated to issue apostilles only on certain types of documents. For example, in Hungary, apostilles are issued on court documents by the Ministry of Justice, on notarial documents by the Chamber of Civil Law Notaries, and on other documents by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; in Mexico, apostilles on federal documents are issued by the federal Secretariat of Governance, and on state documents by the respective state government.

In general, documents issued by a government official can be certified directly with an apostille, while other documents must be certified by a notary, who may then be certified with an apostille. In some cases, additional intermediate certifications may be required; for example, for notarized or municipal documents in some U.S. states, the notary or municipal official must be certified by the respective county or court, which may then be certified by the respective state with an apostille.

===Cost===
The fee for issuing an apostille varies widely by state. In 2016, the HCCH compiled fees of 54 states and calculated an average of 15.43 EUR. Some states, such as France and Japan, do not charge a fee, while the Cayman Islands charge 150 KYD (180 USD), one of the highest. In some states, the fee also varies by location, authority, quantity, purpose or type of document. For example, in the United States, Indiana does not charge a fee for an apostille of a birth certificate, while Connecticut charges 40 USD for an apostille not related to adoption.

===Format===

The apostille is a stamp or printed form, placed on the document itself or attached to the document as an allonge. At the top is the title &quot;Apostille&quot;, followed by &quot;(Convention de La Haye du 5 octobre 1961)&quot; (French for &quot;Hague Convention of 5 October 1961&quot;). The convention specifies that this text must be in French. After this text, the apostille contains ten numbered fields, which may be in English, French or the language of the competent authority, and may be repeated in one or more additional languages. The numbered fields contain the following information:
# Country: [e.g. Hong Kong, China]&lt;br&gt;This public document
# has been signed by [e.g. Henry CHO]
# acting in the capacity of [e.g. Notary Public]
# bears the seal/stamp of [e.g. High Court of Hong Kong]&lt;br&gt;Certified
# at [location or authority issuing the apostille, e.g. High Court]
# the [e.g. 16 April 2014]
# by [e.g. Louis TANG, Registrar, High Court]
# No. [e.g. 2536218517]
# Seal/stamp: [of the authority issuing the apostille, e.g. Emblem of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region]
# Signature: [of the official issuing the apostille]

===Verification===

Each competent authority must maintain a register of apostilles issued, for verification on request by anyone.

In 2006, the electronic apostille program (also known as e-APP) was launched to support the electronic issuance and verification of apostilles around the world. Since then, many contracting states have implemented electronic apostilles or electronic registers for their verification.

===Validity===
Apostilles never expire. However, a document certified with an apostille may have an expiration date, or the destination state may require that the document be presented by a certain time.

===Additional requirements===
The apostille replaces the legalization requirement, but the destination state may have additional requirements for the document to be used there. For example, it may require that the document be translated into a certain language, although it must not require a translation of the apostille itself.

==Benefits and disadvantages==
The Apostille Convention is beneficial in cases that would otherwise require certifications by both the origin and destination states, as the convention removes the latter requirement. However, the convention is neutral in cases that would otherwise require only a certification by the state of origin anyway, similar to an apostille, or no certification at all, and it can be disadvantageous in cases where a consular certification alone would otherwise be sufficient to legalize a document. The convention requires that contracting states direct their embassies and consulates to no longer perform legalizations of documents where the convention applies, so in this case the apostille is the only method available to certify the document, not only an alternative to consular legalization, even if the latter would be simpler or less expensive.

For example, before Brazil acceded to the Apostille Convention, to legalize an educational document from the United States for academic use in Brazil, it was sufficient for the document to be certified by a Brazilian embassy or consulate in the United States, for a fee of 5 USD. After the convention entered into force in Brazil, its embassy and consulates in the United States no longer perform legalizations, so U.S. documents must have an apostille to be accepted in Brazil. In some U.S. states, an apostille of an educational document requires more certifications or a higher fee than the Brazilian consular legalization did.

This result is an unintended consequence, as the convention still allows states to further simplify or eliminate the legalization requirement. The Hague Conference also encourages contracting states to eliminate the need for additional certifications before issuing an apostille, and to ensure that any fees are reasonable.

==Limitations and abuse==
The apostille only certifies that the signature, signer&#x27;s capacity, and seal or stamp on the document are from the stated issuer. In other words, it only certifies the origin of the document, but it does not provide information about its content. In 2008, the Hague Conference expressed serious concerns about diplomas and certificates issued by diploma mills, citing their possible use &quot;to circumvent migration controls, possibly by potential terrorists.&quot; The risk comes from the fact that the various government stamps give the document an air of authenticity without anyone having checked the underlying document. To address this concern, in 2009 the Hague Conference recommended that authorities add the following statement to apostilles: &quot;This apostille only certifies the signature, the capacity of the signer, and the seal or stamp it bears. It does not certify the content of the document for which it was issued.&quot;

<doc id="621526" wikidata="Q723382" url="?curid=621526" title="John Virgo">
<text>John Virgo (born 4 March 1946) is an English snooker commentator and former professional snooker player. Virgo won four professional titles, including the 1979 UK Championship, the 1980 Bombay International and the 1984 Professional Snooker League. A member of the sport&#x27;s elite Top 16 for seven seasons, Virgo is also a former British Open and World Championship semi-finalist and was runner-up of the 1980 Champion of Champions and the 1984 Australian Masters.

==Snooker career==
===Early professional career (1973–1978)===
Virgo&#x27;s first notable appearance in a major tournament was during the 1973 American Pool Tournament for The Indoor League where he lost in the semi-final. He turned professional in 1976, at a time when players such as Ray Reardon, John Spencer and Eddie Charlton were at the forefront of the sport. Although he had just turned 30 upon turning pro, Virgo was still among the youngest players on the circuit at the time. In 1977, he reached the semi-finals of the 1977 UK Championship losing to eventual winner Patsy Fagan by a single frame 8–9.

===UK Champion and Top 10 player (1979–1990)===
Virgo&#x27;s snooker-playing fortunes peaked in 1979 when he reached the semi-final of the World Championship, and went on to win the 1979 UK Championship (though this was not a ranking event at the time). En route to the final, he beat Tony Meo, Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor. He overcame the reigning world champion Terry Griffiths in the final, despite being controversially docked two frames because of a miscommunication regarding the start time of the next session of play. He reached his highest ranking, world number 10, during the 1979–80 season.

In 1986, Virgo reached the semi-finals of the British Open, losing 4–9 to Willie Thorne. He ended the 1989–90 season as world number 14, but dropped out of the elite top 16 the following season.

===Later career and retirement (1991–1995)===
In 1993, Virgo entered the qualifying stages of the Grand Prix and the UK Championship but failed to qualify for the main events, losing both times in round seven. Virgo retired from professional play in 1994.

==Television career==
As part of his exhibition performances, Virgo performed trick shots and comedic impressions of other snooker players. During the 1981 World Championship, he performed some of his impressions, including Alex Higgins, Steve Davis and Ray Reardon. He repeated this act in further World Championships, usually after semi-finals that had ended earlier than expected.

From 1991 to 2002, Virgo was co-presenter of the snooker-based TV game show &quot;Big Break&quot; with Jim Davidson. The 30-min show paired three contestants with three tour snooker players in a three-round format to win the contestants prizes. He coined his catchphrase &quot;Pot as many balls as you can&quot; when asked by Davidson to explain the first round rules. After that round, Virgo presented a &quot;trick shot&quot; segment, where the losing contestant would try to win a consolation prize by playing a snooker trick shot demonstrated by Virgo.

He is now a TV snooker commentator, working primarily during the BBC&#x27;s coverage of ranking events.

During his commentary, Virgo is known for saying, &quot;Where&#x27;s the going?&quot;, if he sees the cue ball heading towards a pocket for a possible foul.

On the Talking Snooker podcast in September 2021, Virgo announced that he and his colleague Dennis Taylor were to be axed by the BBC at the end of that season. It was revealed in April 2022 that their time with the BBC would be extended to take in the 2022-23 season In late 2022, however, the BBC production team informed Virgo that he would in fact stay on for the &quot;foreseeable future&quot;.

==Other activities==
Virgo&#x27;s tribute book to Alex Higgins, &quot;Let Me Tell You About Alex&quot;, was published in February 2011 and described as &quot;explosive&quot;. In April 2012, his book &quot;Amazing Snooker Trick Shots&quot; was published.

In 2012, Virgo featured as himself in Nicholas Gleaves&#x27; debut radio play &quot;Sunk&quot;, in which he guides a young man in his dream of becoming a snooker champion to avoid a life of crime. This was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.

Virgo worked with a pool and snooker table company called Liberty Games to create a web-based series of trick shot videos known as the Trick Shot Academy.

In 2014, Virgo released a trick shot app, &quot;John Virgo&#x27;s Snooker Trick Shots&quot;, available on Apple and Android devices.

==Personal life==
Virgo has two children, a son from his first marriage and a daughter from his second marriage. He separated from his first wife Avril, in 1991, after eight years together. In 2010, he married his second wife, Rosie.

<doc id="621527" wikidata="Q780394" url="?curid=621527" title="Hotel California">
<text>&quot;Hotel California&quot; is a song by American rock band Eagles, released as the second single of their album of the same name on February 22, 1977. The song was written by Don Felder (music), Don Henley, and Glenn Frey (lyrics), featuring Henley on lead vocals and concluding with a 2 minute and 12 seconds long electric guitar solo performed by Felder and Joe Walsh, in which they take turns playing the lead before harmonizing and playing arpeggios together towards the fade-out.

The song is one of the best-known recordings by the band, and in 1998 its long guitar coda was voted the best guitar solo of all time by readers of &quot;Guitarist&quot;. The song was awarded the Grammy Award for Record of the Year in 1978. The meaning of the lyrics of the song has been discussed by fans and critics ever since its release. The Eagles themselves described the song as their &quot;interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles&quot;. In the 2013 documentary &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;, Henley said that the song was about &quot;a journey from innocence to experience ... that&#x27;s all.&quot;

Since its release, &quot;Hotel California&quot; has been widely regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of all time, and has been covered by many artists. Julia Phillips proposed adapting the song into a film, but the members of the Eagles disliked the idea and it never came to fruition. Commercially, &quot;Hotel California&quot; reached the number one position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and reached the top ten of several international charts. The Eagles have performed &quot;Hotel California&quot; well over 1,000 times live, and is the third most performed of all their songs, after &quot;Desperado&quot; and &quot;Take It Easy&quot;.

==History==

===Composition===

A demo of the instrumental was developed by Don Felder in a rented house on Malibu Beach. He recorded the basic tracks with a Rhythm Ace drum machine and added a 12 string guitar on a four-track recording deck in his spare bedroom, then mixed in a bassline, and gave Don Henley and Glenn Frey each a copy of the recording. Felder, who met the Eagles through his high school bandmate Bernie Leadon, said that Leadon advised him to make tapes of songs he wrote for the band so that other band members like Henley, whose forte is in writing lyrics, might work with him on finishing the songs they liked. The demos he made were always instrumental, and on every album project he would submit 15 or 16 ideas. The demo he made for &quot;Hotel California&quot; showed influences from Latin and reggae music, and it grabbed the attention of Henley who said he liked the song that &quot;sounds like a Mexican reggae or Bolero&quot;, which gave the song its first working title, &quot;Mexican Reggae&quot;. &quot;Record World&quot; said that &quot;a mild reggae flavor pervades the tune&quot;.

Frey and Henley were both interested in the tune after hearing the demo, and discussed the concept for the lyrics. In 2008, Felder described the writing of the lyrics:

Henley decided on the theme of &quot;Hotel California&quot;, noting how The Beverly Hills Hotel had become a literal and symbolic focal point of their lives at that time. Henley said of their personal and professional experience in LA: &quot;We were getting an extensive education, in life, in love, in business. Beverly Hills was still a mythical place to us. In that sense it became something of a symbol, and the &#x27;Hotel&#x27; the of all that LA had come to mean for us. In a sentence, I&#x27;d sum it up as the end of the innocence, round one.&quot;

Frey came up with a cinematic scenario of a person who, tired from driving a long distance in a desert, saw a place for a rest and pulled in for the night, but entered &quot;a weird world peopled by freaky characters&quot;, and became &quot;quickly spooked by the claustrophobic feeling of being caught in a disturbing web from which he may never escape&quot;. In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song &quot;to open like an episode of the &quot;Twilight Zone&quot;&quot;, and added: &quot;We take this guy and make him like a character in &quot;The Magus&quot;, where every time he walks through a door there&#x27;s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie.&quot; Frey described the song in an interview with NBC&#x27;s Bob Costas as a cinematic montage &quot;just one shot to the next[...] a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people&quot;. Frey continued: &quot;We decided to create something strange, just to see if we could do it.&quot; Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey&#x27;s idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.

Part of the lyrics, such as &quot;Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes / She got a lot of pretty pretty boys she calls friends&quot;, are based on Henley&#x27;s break-up with his girlfriend Loree Rodkin. According to Frey&#x27;s liner notes for &quot;The Very Best Of&quot;, the use of the word &quot;steely&quot; in the lyric &quot;They stab it with their steely knives, but they just can&#x27;t kill the beast&quot; was a playful nod to the band Steely Dan, who had included the lyric &quot;Turn up the Eagles, the neighbors are listening&quot; in their song &quot;Everything You Did&quot;. Frey had also said that the writing of the song was inspired by the boldness of Steely Dan&#x27;s lyrics and its willingness to go &quot;out there&quot;, and thought that the song they wrote had &quot;achieved perfect ambiguity.&quot;

===Recordings===
The Eagles recorded the track with Don Henley on lead vocal three different times, twice at the Record Plant in Los Angeles and finally at the Criteria Studios in Miami. They first recorded a riff, but when it came to recording the vocal, it was found to be in too high a key for Henley&#x27;s voice, so Felder progressively lowered the key from E minor, eventually settling on B minor. The second recording, however, was judged too fast. In Miami, the band fine-tuned the instrumentation and the lyrics and recorded numerous complete takes. Five or six best ones were selected, and the best parts were then spliced together to create the released version. According to the producer Bill Szymczyk, there were 33 edits on the two‑inch master. The final section features a guitar battle between Joe Walsh (who had replaced Bernie Leadon after Leadon&#x27;s departure from the band in 1975) with a Fender Telecaster and Felder with a Gibson Les Paul, which took the two of them sitting together working for around three days to achieve the necessary precision. Walsh and Felder initially started improvising but Henley insisted that the recording should follow the music as first recorded in Felder&#x27;s demo. However, according to Szymczyk, Walsh and Felder&#x27;s improvisations did make the final cut of the song, with the producer splicing different Walsh and Felder licks together while he, Walsh, and Felder arranged harmonized guitar parts together in the studio.

Henley decided that the song should be a single, although Felder had doubts and the record company was reluctant to release it because, at over six minutes, its duration far exceeded that of the songs generally played by radio stations. The band took a stand and refused the label&#x27;s request to shorten the song. The song was released as the second single from the album after &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;. The front cover art for some overseas editions of the 45rpm single released was a reworked version of the &quot;Hotel California&quot; LP cover art, which used a photograph of the Beverly Hills Hotel by David Alexander, with design and art direction by Kosh.
As &quot;Hotel California&quot; became one of the group&#x27;s most popular songs and a concert staple for the band, live recordings of the song have therefore also been released. The first live recording of the song appeared on the Eagles&#x27; 1980 live album, and an acoustic version with an extended intro is a track on the 1994 &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; reunion concert CD and video release. The &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; version is performed using eight guitars and has a decidedly Spanish sound, with Felder&#x27;s flamenco-inspired arrangement and intro.

A music video for the song, filmed at the Capital Centre in March 1977, was first aired on the USA Network as part of the &quot;Night Flight&quot; program in August 1985. This video would continue to air on VH1. In 2013, a re-edited version of the video, as well as other footage from the Capital Centre concerts, was released as part of the &quot;History of the Eagles&quot; documentary set.

In 1998, at the induction of the Eagles into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, all seven members of the Eagles (Henley, Frey, Felder, 
Walsh, Meisner, Leadon, and Schmit) appeared on stage together for the only time to perform &quot;Hotel California&quot;.

===Chart performance===
&quot;Hotel California&quot; first entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart dated February 26, 1977, and topped the Hot 100 singles chart for one week in May 1977, the band&#x27;s fourth song to reach No. 1 on that chart. It peaked at number 10 on the Easy Listening chart in April 1977. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it number 19 on its 1977 Pop Singles year-end chart. Three months after its first release, the single was certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), representing one million copies shipped. In 2009, the song was further certified Platinum (Digital Sales Award) by the RIAA for sales of one million digital downloads, and has since sold over 3 million downloads.

===Accolades===
The Eagles won the 1977 Grammy Award for Record of the Year for &quot;Hotel California&quot; at the 20th Grammy Awards in 1978. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;the luxuriant harmonies are here, of course, along with muted rhythm guitars and vocal inflections that add a West Indian flavor&quot; and &quot;the multi-tracked guitar harmonies...end the cut with melodrama&quot;. In 2003, the song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

The song is rated highly in many rock music lists and polls. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked it number 49 on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; in 2004 and #311 in 2021. It was named one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. At the induction of the Eagles into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998, all seven former and present members of the band reunited to perform &quot;Hotel California&quot; and &quot;Take It Easy.&quot;

The song&#x27;s guitar solo was voted the best solo of all time by readers of &quot;Guitarist&quot; magazine in 1998, and was ranked 8th on &quot;Guitar Magazine&quot;″s Top 100 Guitar Solos. The song was also included in the music video game &quot;Guitar Hero World Tour&quot;. It was ranked number 1 in the list of the best 12-string guitar songs of all times by &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine in 2015.

==Themes and interpretations==
Glenn Frey said that originally &quot;We decided to create something strange, just to see if we could do it,&quot; and that the song was meant to mimic the imagery of the 1965 novel &quot;The Magus&quot; by John Fowles, about a man in an unfamiliar rural setting who is unsure about what he is experiencing.

Don Henley has given a number of explanations about the song, ranging from &quot;a journey from innocence to experience&quot; to &quot;a sociopolitical statement.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Henley said that the song was meant to be &quot;more of a symbolic piece about America in general,&quot; and added, &quot;Lyrically, the song deals with traditional or classical themes of conflict: darkness and light, good and evil, youth and age, the spiritual versus the secular. I guess you could say it&#x27;s a song about loss of innocence.&quot;

The song has been described as being &quot;all about American decadence and burnout, too much money, corruption, drugs and arrogance; too little humility and heart.&quot; It has also been interpreted as an allegory about hedonism, self-destruction, and greed in the music industry of the late 1970s. Henley called it &quot;our interpretation of the high life in Los Angeles,&quot; and later said, &quot;It&#x27;s not really about California; it&#x27;s about America. It&#x27;s about the dark underbelly of the American dream. It&#x27;s about excess, it&#x27;s about narcissism. It&#x27;s about the music business. ... It can have a million interpretations.&quot; In the 2013 documentary, &quot;History of the Eagles&quot;, Henley reiterated:

In a 2009 interview, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; music critic John Soeder asked Henley if he regretted writing the lines &quot;So I called up the captain / &#x27;Please bring me my wine&#x27; / He said, &#x27;We haven&#x27;t had that spirit here since 1969&#x27;&quot; because wines are fermented while spirits are distilled. Henley responded:

In his &quot;Encyclopedia of Great Popular Song Recordings, Volume 1&quot;, Steve Sullivan theorizes that the &quot;spirit&quot; that the Hotel California hasn&#x27;t had since 1969 refers to the spirit of social activism of the 1960s, and how disco and the related pop music of the mid-1970s had turned away from it.

===Conjectures===
The metaphorical character of the story related in the lyrics has inspired a number of conjectural interpretations by listeners. In the 1980s, the Rev. Paul Risley of Cornerstone Church in Burlington, Wisconsin, alleged that &quot;Hotel California&quot; referred to a San Francisco hotel that was purchased by Anton LaVey and converted into his Church of Satan. The song also allegedly contained backwards messages purportedly referring to Satanism: &quot;Yes, Satan, he organized his own religion... It was delicious... He puts it in a vat and fixes it for his son and gives it away.&quot; Don Felder denied any such allegations in a 2019 interview, maintaining that the song was about &quot;the underbelly industry in Los Angeles, how it can be less than beautiful.&quot; Other rumors suggested that the Hotel California mentioned in the song was actually the Camarillo State Mental Hospital, which was shut down in 1997, and redeveloped into California State University Channel Islands.

The term &quot;colitas&quot; in the first stanza (&quot;warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air&quot;) has been interpreted as a sexual slang or a reference to marijuana. &quot;Colitas&quot; means &quot;little tails&quot; in Spanish; in Mexican slang it refers the flowering buds of the cannabis plant. According to Glenn Frey, the &quot;warm smell&quot; is &quot;colitas ... it means little tails, the very top of the plant.&quot; The Eagles&#x27; manager Irving Azoff appears to lend support to the marijuana hypothesis; however, Felder said, &quot;The colitas is a plant that grows in the desert that blooms at night, and it has this kind of pungent, almost funky smell. Don Henley came up with a lot of the lyrics for that song, and he came up with colitas.&quot;

Other interpretations of the song range from drug addiction to cannibalism. On the various interpretations, Henley said: &quot;Some of the wilder interpretations of that song have been amazing. It was really about the excesses of American culture and certain girls we knew. But it was also about the uneasy balance between art and commerce.&quot;

==Harmonic structure==
The intro and verses&#x27; chord pattern counts eight measures, each one assigned to a single chord. Seven different chords are used in the eight measures. As the song opens, it is not until the eighth measure that a chord is repeated. The song is initially in the key of B-minor. The presence of E major (a borrowed chord that contains a G#, which isn&#x27;t usually found in the key of B minor), gives a hint of B Dorian mode.

The chords are played as follows:

:Bm–F7–A–E–G–D–Em–F7

:or

:Assuming the key of D (the relative major of B minor):
:vi–III7–V–II–IV–I–ii–III7

The eight-measure sequence is repeated in the intro, for each verse and in the outro, providing the harmonic framework for the entire extended dual guitar solo at the end of the song. One explanation of the progression is that it is a common flamenco chord progression called the &quot;Spanish progression&quot; (i–VII–VI–V in a Phrygian context) that is interspersed with consecutive fifths. With its descending ostinato pattern, it could be considered a fandango, a forerunner of the Baroque chaconne form.

This chord sequence is not commonly used, and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull has pointed out its similarity to his song &quot;We Used to Know&quot; from their 1969 album &quot;Stand Up&quot;, an international hit which reached No. 1 in UK album chart and No. 20 in U.S. Billboard album chart, suggesting the Eagles heard it on the album or when they toured together. While the Eagles did open for Jethro Tull in June 1972, Don Felder, who wrote the music, did not join the band until 1974 and would not have been backstage at their concerts. Felder has said that he had never heard &quot;We Used to Know&quot;, and that he was unfamiliar with Jethro Tull apart from the fact the frontman plays a flute. Anderson himself indicated that his comments on the similarities between the songs were meant as a joke, and said: &quot;It&#x27;s not plagiarism. It&#x27;s just the same chord sequence. It&#x27;s in a different time signature, different key, different context. ... Harmonic progression—it&#x27;s almost a mathematical certainty that you&#x27;re gonna crop up with the same thing sooner or later if you&#x27;re strumming a few chords on a guitar.&quot;

The chorus, or refrain, uses five of the verse&#x27;s seven chords, structured with the melody in a way that infers a key change from B minor to its relative major key of D.

:G–D–F7–Bm–G–D–Em–F7
:or
:assuming a key of D:
:IV–I–III7–vi–IV–I–ii–III7

==Cultural influence==
&quot;Hotel California&quot; and its lyrics have become absorbed into the wider culture around the world, and have been used by various writers and commentators to reflect on issues ranging from politics to social media and welfare, or as an observation on a particular situation. The lines &quot;We are programmed to receive / You can check out any time you like / But you can never leave!&quot; were used by an economist to refer to how the appeal of an attractive &quot;Hotel California&quot;-type host country to foreign investors may be countered by the cost of exit on leaving the country. A term &quot;The Hotel California Effect&quot; was then used to refer to the negative effect of financial regulations on investment, and the problems foreign investors faced when getting their money out of China. It has also applied to other ideas such as problems when leaving a service provider or social media network, or when exiting cloud computing. The same analogy has been used by various commentators considering scenarios for Brexit, with the term &quot;Hotel California Brexit&quot;.

A book titled &quot;Operation Hotel California: The Clandestine War Inside Iraq&quot; was written about the clandestine operation named after the song title by CIA–US Special Forces teams in Iraqi Kurdistan in the lead-up to the Iraq War.

Although the Eagles were noted for their reluctance to license their songs for use in shows, the song has been used in a number of films and television shows, such as &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (performed by the Gipsy Kings), &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot;, &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (&quot;Hotel&quot;), &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, and the end credits of &quot;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&quot;.

==Alleged theft of handwritten lyrics==
On July 13, 2022, three individualsrare-book dealer Glenn Horowitz and rock memorabilia specialists Craig Inciardi and Edward Kosinskiwere charged after allegedly conspiring to sell Henley&#x27;s handwritten lyrics to the song &quot;Hotel California&quot; and two other songs from the same album that the Manhattan District Attorney&#x27;s office claims were improperly obtained. Prosecutors claim the lyrics could be worth over $1 million at auction. The three men pleaded not guilty and were released without bail pending trial. Eagles manager Irving Azoff said the case exposed &quot;the truth about music memorabilia sales of highly personal, stolen items hidden behind a façade of legitimacy&quot;. In February 2024, Henley testified that he never gave the lyric sheets away and repeated his claim from 2012 that they were stolen from his barn in Malibu, California decades prior. Henley also acknowledged that he granted writer Ed Sanders, who in 1979 began working with The Eagles on a biography which was never published, some access to them, but stated that he never allowed Sanders to have permanent possession of them. Though Sanders was not among those charged, he was acknowledged to have sold 100 pages worth of Hotel California lyric sheets to Horowitz in 2005 after alleging to Horowitz that Henley&#x27;s assistant sent him the documents. Eventually, Inciardi and Kosinski would begin auctioning them in 2012. Defense lawyers have claimed Henley legally gave Sanders the lyric sheets. On March 6, 2024, Assistant Manhattan District Attorney Aaron Ginandes abruptly dropped the criminal case against Horowitz, Inciardi and Kosinski midtrial, stating to the presiding judge that prosecutors believed that newly released emails backed defense arguments which questioned the trial&#x27;s fairness.

<doc id="621530" wikidata="Q1305365" url="?curid=621530" title="Yellow-browed bulbul">
<text>The yellow-browed bulbul (Acritillas indica), or golden-browed bulbul, is a species of songbird in the bulbul family, Pycnonotidae. It is found in the forests of southern India and Sri Lanka. The yellow-browed bulbul is mainly yellow on the underside and olive above with a distinct yellow brow. They are easily located by their loud calls but tend to skulk within foliage below the forest canopy. While its taxonomic classification has changed over time, it is currently the sole species within the monotypic genus Acritillas which is closely related to &quot;Hemixos&quot;.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The yellow-browed bulbul was originally described in the genus &quot;Trichophorus&quot; (a synonym for &quot;Criniger&quot;) in 1839 by T. C. Jerdon on the basis of specimens from the Wynaad region and given the original binomial (or protonym) of &quot;Trichophorus indicus&quot;. Formerly, the yellow-browed bulbul was classified in the genus &quot;Iole&quot; as two separate species but a study determined that this species is exceptional and it is now placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Acritillas&quot;. Some authorities have included the yellow-browed bulbul in the genus &quot;Hypsipetes&quot; but a 2018 molecular phylogenetic study indicated the nearest living relative as &quot;Hemixos flavala&quot;.

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are currently recognized:

* &quot;A. i. icterica&quot; - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Criniger&quot; from a specimen from Satara, Maharashtra. The upperparts are more greyish green and the yellow a bit duller and it is found in the northern Western Ghats population but intergrades with &quot;A. i. indica&quot; in the Londa area.
* &quot;A. i. indica&quot; - : Found in the Western Ghats and Nilgiris of India, northern and eastern Sri Lanka. This has the yellow brighter than in &quot;A. i. icterica&quot;.
* &quot;A. i. guglielmi&quot; - : Found in south-western Sri Lanka. Has a more greenish plumage with the underparts tinged green unlike the bronzy tinge of &quot;A. i. indica&quot;.

==Description==
This bulbul is about long, lacks a crest and has the upperparts olive-green with a prominent yellow brow and goggle with the underparts being all yellow. The sexes do not differ in plumage. The bill is black and the iris is reddish brown. The population in the northern Western Ghats (ssp. &quot;icterica&quot;) is paler yellow than the populations further south (ssp. &quot;indica&quot;). A somewhat disjunct population is found in the Eastern Ghats. Southwestern Sri Lankan populations (ssp. &quot;gugliemi&quot;) are greener while the northern populations are included in the nominate subspecies.
 The calls include a whistle-like call and sharp &quot;pick-wick&quot; notes.

==Distribution and habitat==
The yellow-browed bulbul has been considered as the wet-zone counterpart of the dry-zone white-browed bulbul. It is found mainly below the forest canopy of the hill forests and plantations in the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka. They also occur in parts of the Eastern Ghats including the Kolli hills, Nallamalas and parts of Tirupathi and Mamandur regions in Andhra Pradesh.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Yellow-browed bulbuls are found in pairs or small groups and call loudly. They feed mainly on berries and insects. The breeding season is during the dry spell before the monsoons, mainly January to May. The nest is a cup built in a low fork covered with moss and cobwebs on the outside, giving the appearance of a large white-eye nest, and lined with fine root fibres. The typical clutch size in India is three eggs and in Sri Lanka two. A study of 153 nests in Silent Valley National Park of India found 92% of nests had two eggs. Peak breeding in the Silent Valley National Park of Kerala was found in January and February. About a week is taken for building the nest and the eggs are incubated for about 13 days. The eggs are pale pink or white with reddish brown speckling. The eggs hatch synchronously and the nestlings fledge after about 13 days. Nestlings are fed with caterpillars, soft insects and berries.

<doc id="621531" wikidata="Q419186" url="?curid=621531" title="Ergotamine">
<text>Ergotamine, sold under the brand name Ergomar among others, is an ergopeptine and part of the ergot family of alkaloids; it is structurally and biochemically closely related to ergoline. It is structurally similar to several neurotransmitters, and it acts as a vasoconstrictor. It is used for acute migraines, sometimes with caffeine as the combination ergotamine/caffeine.

Medicinal use of ergot fungus began in the 16th century, for the induction of childbirth; but dosage uncertainty discouraged its use. It has been used to prevent post-partum hemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth). It was first isolated from the ergot fungus by Arthur Stoll, at Sandoz in 1918, and was marketed as Gynergen in 1921.

==Medical uses==
Ergotamine is indicated as therapy to abort or prevent vascular headache.

=== Available forms ===
Ergotamine is available as a suppository and as a tablet, sometimes in combination with caffeine.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications include: atherosclerosis, Buerger&#x27;s syndrome, coronary artery disease, hepatic disease, pregnancy, pruritus, Raynaud&#x27;s syndrome, and renal disease.
It&#x27;s also contraindicated if patient is taking macrolide antibiotics (e.g., erythromycin), certain HIV protease inhibitors (e.g., ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir), certain azole antifungals (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) delavirdine, efavirenz, or a 5-HT1 receptor agonist (e.g., sumatriptan).

==Side effects==
Side effects of ergotamine include nausea and vomiting. At higher doses, it can cause raised arterial blood pressure, vasoconstriction (including coronary vasospasm) and bradycardia or tachycardia. Severe vasoconstriction may cause symptoms of intermittent claudication.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Ergotamine interacts with serotonin, adrenergic, and dopamine receptors. It is an agonist of serotonin receptors including the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 subtypes. Ergotamine is an agonist of the serotonin 5-HT2B receptor and has been associated with cardiac valvulopathy. Despite acting as a potent 5-HT2A receptor agonist, ergotamine is said to be non-hallucinogenic similarly to lisuride. This is thought to be due to functional selectivity at the 5-HT2A receptor. However, an alternative possibility is that it is due to peripheral selectivity.

===Pharmacokinetics===
The bioavailability of ergotamine is around 2% orally, 6% rectally, and 100% by intramuscular or intravenous injection. The low oral and rectal bioavailability is due to low gastrointestinal absorption and high first-pass metabolism.

Ergotamine may not readily cross the blood–brain barrier.

==Biosynthesis==
Ergotamine is a secondary metabolite (natural product) and the principal alkaloid produced by the ergot fungus, &quot;Claviceps purpurea&quot;, and related fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae. Its biosynthesis in these fungi requires the amino acid -tryptophan and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursor compounds are the substrates for the enzyme, tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase, catalyzing the first step in ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, i.e., the prenylation of -tryptophan. Further reactions, involving methyltransferase and oxygenase enzymes, yield the ergoline, lysergic acid. Lysergic acid (LA) is the substrate of &quot;lysergyl peptide synthetase&quot;, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, which covalently links LA to the amino acids, -alanine, -proline, and -phenylalanine. Enzyme-catalyzed or spontaneous cyclizations, oxygenations/oxidations, and isomerizations at selected residues precede, and give rise to, formation of ergotamine.

== Society and culture ==
=== Legal status ===
Ergotamine is a List I regulated chemical in the United States.

<text>&quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; is a single by the Carpenters, written by Roger Nichols (music) and Paul Williams (lyrics). It was ranked at No. 414 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.&quot; It also became Carpenters&#x27; second consecutive top-five single in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Song information==
The song was originally in a wedding-themed television commercial for Crocker National Bank in California in early 1970, with Paul Williams on vocals. Hal Riney of the San Francisco-based advertising agency Hal Riney &amp; Partners had commissioned the song to help Crocker appeal to young people. The song played over footage of a couple getting married and just starting out. In the song, direct reference to the bank was left out, in part to make the song more marketable. The commercial turned out to be very popular, but it attracted customers in which the bank was not interested: young adult customers with no collateral for loans. The campaign was eventually suspended, and Crocker subsequently franchised it to other banks.

As a single, the full song was first recorded by Smokey Roberds, a friend of Nichols, singing under the name &quot;Freddie Allen&quot;. It was released in March 1970 but did not get significant airplay. Separately, Richard Carpenter saw the TV commercial and guessed correctly that Williams was the vocalist (both of them were under contract to A&amp;M Records). Carpenter ran into Williams on the record company&#x27;s lot and asked whether a full-length version was available. Although the TV commercial had only two verses and no bridge, Williams stated that there was a bridge and an additional verse, forming a complete song, which was then delivered.

According to Williams in the documentary &quot;Close to You: Remembering The Carpenters&quot; &quot;We&#x27;d had some success with songs before, a few album cuts and some B-sides - but no singles. This was a major break, a chance to get an A-side and maybe even a hit, so we would have absolutely lied through our teeth if there wasn&#x27;t a full song.&quot;

Carpenter selected the composition for the duo&#x27;s third single and included it on the LP &quot;Close to You&quot;. Released in late summer 1970, the single featured Karen&#x27;s lead vocals and the overdubbed harmonies of both siblings. Following their hit &quot;(They Long to Be) Close to You&quot; onto the charts, &quot;We&#x27;ve Only Just Begun&quot; hit No. 1 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; singles chart and No. 2 on the U.S.&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 behind the Jackson 5&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and the Partridge Family&#x27;s &quot;I Think I Love You&quot;, becoming the pair&#x27;s second million-selling gold single, spending nine weeks in the Top 10. It was considered by both Karen and Richard to be their signature song. According to &quot;The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits&quot; (6th edition), on the U.S. Adult Contemporary singles chart, it was the duo&#x27;s best-performing tune, lasting seven weeks at No. 1 (beating the six-week stay at the top of &quot;Close to You&quot;). The song also helped them to win two Grammy Awards in 1971: Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus (for &quot;Close to You&quot;).

Williams recorded his own version of the song for his 1971 album &quot;Just an Old Fashioned Love Song&quot;.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; described the song as having &quot;delicious lyrics and a sparkling production.&quot;

For Williams, the song was a personal victory; it was his first collaboration with Nichols that resulted in a hit single, and it opened the door to many more thereafter. In 1998, the recording was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame for recordings &quot;of lasting quality or historical significance&quot;.

Although it only charted at number 28 in the UK Singles Chart in 1970, its subsequent growth in popularity in the UK saw it voted second in &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Favourite Carpenters Song&quot;, broadcast by ITV in 2016.

==Music video==
The music video for the song was shot in a red background with the letters for the word &quot;you&quot;. Karen was sitting in the letter &quot;u&quot; while Richard was standing beside her. He also was not playing the piano as he usually did. The video was shot as part of the 1971 television series &quot;Make Your Own Kind of Music&quot;.

<text>The Handley Page HP.81 Hermes was a civilian airliner designed and produced by the British aircraft manufacturer Handley Page.

The Hermes was developed during the 1940s in parallel with the closely related Handley Page Hastings military transport. It was a low-wing monoplane, with most examples being powered by four piston engines. Originally intended to enter service in advance of the Hastings, development of the Hermes was delayed by the fatal loss of the first prototype during its maiden flight on 2 December 1945. Measures were taken to improve the airliner&#x27;s stability as well as to expand its capacity, which sufficiently impressed the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) into placing a sizeable order for 25 &quot;HP 81 Hermes IV&quot; on 4 February 1947. A pair of turboprop-powered development aircraft were also ordered by the Ministry of Supply for experimental flights.

The Hermes entered airline service on 6 August 1950, having been delayed by roughly one year due to initial production aircraft being overweight. They would be operated by BOAC, the most prominent operator of the type, for less than a decade before they were sold onto other operators largely due to the rapid advances in airliners made during this era. During its later years of service, second hand Hermes were routinely used by various charter airlines. The final Hermes flight was performed sometime during 1969, by which point most of the type had already been scrapped as obsolete. A single example has been partially preserved.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The Hermes can be traced back to discussions held by the Air Staff (United Kingdom) as early as summer 1943. At the time, authorities were considering not only the need for an immediate successor to the Royal Air Force&#x27;s (RAF) fleet of Handley Page Halifax in the transport/freighter capacity, but also the role of an interim civil airliner for the post-war years. Accordingly, during December 1944, priority orders were placed for various projects, including both the military and civil programmes proposed by the British aircraft manufacturer Handley Page. For the civil airliner, Specification 15/43 was issued by the Air Ministry; this called for a pressurised civil transport that was capable of carrying up to 34 first class or 50 tourist class passengers.

During April 1944, at the urging of George Volkert, Handley Page&#x27;s chief designer, to settle production priorities, the company&#x27;s founder and managing director Frederick Handley Page decided to merge the work of several projects and prioritise the transport aircraft; this also aligned with the release of Specification C.3/44, which sought a multipurpose transport. Handley Page&#x27;s proposal was accepted with no meaningful alterations sought. Shortly thereafter, it was recognised that development of the civil transport posed less of a challenge than the military transport project, thus it was decided that the airliner programme would be flown first. The military transport aircraft, which would share a relatively high level of similarities with the civil project, would enter service as the Handley Page Hastings, while the civil transport became known as the Hermes.

Despite the intentional similarities, there were distinct design differences between the two aircraft. Unlike the tailwheel of the Hastings, the Hermes was planned to have a nosewheel landing gear, although the first two prototypes were completed with a tailwheel undercarriage. Despite the differences, both aircraft remained similar enough that they were produced using the same primary assembly jigs. The first prototype was effectively an unpressurised &quot;bare shell&quot;, while the second featured a pressurised cabin and was fully equipped in most respects. On 9 November 1945, a mock-up conference was held at the company&#x27;s Cricklewood facility, attended by various airline officials and industry figures. Rapid progress on the first prototype&#x27;s construction enabled it to commence ground trials at Radlett on 1 December 1945.

===Into flight and redesign===
While Handley Page had intended for the Hermes to be introduced in advance of the Hastings from an early stage of development, a delay to its production was necessitated after the first prototype (HP 68 Hermes 1), registered &quot;G-AGSS&quot;, crashed during its maiden flight shortly after takeoff on 2 December 1945. It is believed that the aircraft had encountered severe longitudinal instability due to elevator overbalance. Handley Page&#x27;s chief test pilot and the chief test observer were both killed in the incident, while the prototype was completely destroyed by a post-impact fire.

In order to sufficiently resolve the instability that caused the fatal crash, development of the civil Hermes was protracted, while work on the Hastings progressed more smoothly. This delay presented the opportunity to undertake design revisions and improvements; it was decided that the second prototype&#x27;s length would be extended to produce the HP 74 Hermes II. The prospects of powering the type with turboprop engines was also investigated around this time, but ultimately decided against. The first Hermes II (&quot;G-AGUB&quot;) performed its first flight on 2 September 1947; it quickly proved to not only have greater stability, but to also possess a superior lift coefficient to the Hastings as well. On 4 September 1948, the type received its certificate of airworthiness, clearing it for service.

On 4 February 1947, firm orders were placed by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) for 25 of the definitive &quot;HP 81 Hermes IV&quot;. This model was furnished with a tricycle undercarriage and powered by four Bristol Hercules radial engines, each capable of generating up to 2,100 hp (1,570 kW). Additionally, a pair of &quot;Hermes V&quot; airliners were also ordered, the primary difference of this model was the use of four Bristol Theseus turboprop engines instead. Further turboprop-powered developments of the Hermes were also proposed to potential customers as a competitor to types such as the Bristol Britannia.

==Operational history==

===Airline operations===
Despite the first Hermes IV (registered &quot;G-AKFP&quot;) performing its first flight relatively quickly on 5 September 1948, and quantity production being promptly established, BOAC was somewhat unsatisfied by the airliner, primarily due to the early aircraft being overweight. This was in part due to the use of Hastings components and ad-hoc modifications to accelerate flight trials; it was promptly agreed that weight-saving modifications were to be made prior to BOAC issuing its final acceptance of the Hermes. Design alterations to reduce weight included the adoption of lighter floor members.

On 6 August 1950, the Hermes IV finally entered service with BOAC, taking over from the Avro York on the West Africa service from London Heathrow to Accra via Tripoli, Kano and Lagos, with services to Kenya and South Africa commencing before the end of the year. The Hermes IV was used by BOAC on routes to West and South Africa. They were quickly replaced, however by the reliable Canadair Argonaut in 1952, although some re-entered service in July 1954 following the grounding of the de Havilland Comet, being retired again in December.

This was not the end of the Hermes in airline service, however, as surplus aircraft were sold to independent charter airlines, with Airwork purchasing four in 1952, others being operated by Britavia and Skyways, particularly in the trooping role. Many of these aircraft were fitted with Hercules 773 engines, which could be operated on lower octane fuel than the original Hercules 763s, being designated as Hermes IVA. They returned to Hermes IV standards when fuel supplies improved.

Later, the Hermes were flown on inclusive tour holiday flights from the UK. The last operational civil Hermes, &quot;G-ALDA&quot;, flown by Air Links Limited, was retired on 13 December 1964, and was scrapped nine days later.

===Development aircraft===
The two turboprop Hermes V were owned by the Ministry of Supply and made their first flights in August 1949. They were used for development of the Bristol Theseus turboprop engine. The first aircraft was lost in a wheels-up landing at Chilbolton airfield on 10 April 1951, but the second continued development flying with the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&amp;AEE) at MOD Boscombe Down and the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) at Farnborough Airport until its retirement during September 1953.

The prototype Hermes II was given military markings in October 1953 as &quot;VX234&quot; and was used for various research and development programmes, including the testing of airborne radar for the Royal Radar Establishment at RAF Defford, Worcestershire. It was finally retired in 1969, at which point the aircraft had been the final Hermes in operation.

==Preservation==

==Accidents and incidents==
* 3 December 1945 - Hermes I &quot;G-AGSS&quot; the prototype Hermes crashed on the first test flight soon after takeoff three miles from Radlett Aerodrome. The two Handley Page test pilots were killed.
* 26 May 1952 - Hermes IV &quot;G-ALDN&quot; (&quot;Horus&quot;), operated by BOAC, en route from Tripoli, Libya, to Kano, Nigeria, flew off course for several hours and ran out of fuel, force landing in the Sahara Desert south of Atar, Mauritania. The passengers and crew all survived and spent several days in the desert before making their way to an oasis, where First Officer Ted Haslam, who had suffered a head injury in the crash, died.
* 25 August 1952 - Hermes IV &#x27;G-ALDF&#x27; operated by Air-work Ltd en route from Blackbushe to Khartoum via Malta, ditched off Sicily (near Trapani) at 0300 LT, following failure of two engines and the prospect of the other two engines failing. Electrical power also failed, so no lights or radio available. The ditching was &quot;brilliantly performed&quot; and successful, but 6 passengers (including 4 young children) and one air hostess drowned, mainly due to defective life jackets and lack of a life raft for the children. Investigation report by the Italian authorities (not published in UK) is summarised in ICAO Circular 38-AN/33. Contains some criticism of the crew and operating company and recommended improvements to the aircraft and to safety provisions. Matter raised in Parliament by Wedgwood Benn MP.
* 4 March 1956 - Hermes IV &quot;G-ALDW&quot; operated by Skyways Limited was destroyed on the ground by a time-bomb in the forward freight compartment. The aircraft was at Nicosia Airport, Cyprus when the explosion occurred 20 minutes before the aircraft was due to depart for the United Kingdom with 68 passengers. There were no fatalities.
* 5 August 1956 - Hermes IV &quot;G-ALDK&quot; operated by Britavia suffered the collapse of the nose undercarriage at Drigh Road Airport, Karachi, Pakistan. The aircraft was damaged beyond economic repair.
* 5 November 1956 - Hermes IVa &quot;G-ALDJ&quot; operated by Britavia crashed on night approach to Blackbushe Aerodrome, England in bad weather. Seven of the 80 occupants died.
* 1 April 1958 - Hermes IV &quot;G-ALDV&quot; operated by Skyways Limited. Crashed at Meesden Green, close to Stansted Airport, whilst on an airtest after an engine change. The crew of three, Capt. Rayment, Capt. West and FE. N Bradley were all killed.
* 9 October 1960 - Hermes IV &quot;G-ALDC&quot; of Falcon Airways overran the runway on landing at Southend Airport, ending up across the Shenfield to Southend railway line. The aircraft was written off but all 76 people on board survived.

<doc id="621547" wikidata="Q1188550" url="?curid=621547" title="Nautilida">
<text>The Nautilida constitute a large and diverse order of generally coiled nautiloid cephalopods that began in the mid Paleozoic and continues to the present with a single family, the Nautilidae which includes two genera, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;, with six species. All told, between 22 and 34 families and 165 to 184 genera have been recognised, making this the largest order of the subclass Nautiloidea.

==Classification and phylogeny==

===Current classification===
The current classification of the Nautilida, in prevalent use, is that of Bernhard Kummel (Kummel 1964) in the Treatise which divides the Nautilida into five superfamilies, the Aipocerataceae, Clydonautilaceae, Tainocerataceae, and Trigonocerataceae, mostly of the Paleozoic, and the later Nautilaceae. These include 22 families and some 165 or so genera (Teichert and Moore 1964)

===Other concepts===
Shimansky 1962 (in Kummel 1964) divided the Nautilida into five suborders, the mostly Paleozoic Centroceratina, Liroceratina, Rutoceratina, and Tainoceratina, and the Mesozoic to recent Nautilina. These include superfamilies which are different from those of Kummel (1964) and of less extent. The Centroceratina are comparable to the Trigonocerataceae, the Liroceratina to the Clydonautilaceae, and the Nautilina to the Nautilaceae. The main difference is that the Rutoceratidae are included with the Aipocerataceae of Kummel (1964) in the Rutoceratina. The remaining Tainocerataceae are the Tainoceratina.

Rousseau Flower (1950) distinguished the Solenochilida, Rutoceratida, and Centroceratida, as separate orders, from the Nautilida, derived from the Barrandeocerida, which are now abandoned. Within the Nautilida, he placed 10 families, included in the Nautilaceae and the no longer considered ancestral Clydonautilaceae. Teichert&#x27;s 1988 classification is an abridged version of Shimansky&#x27;s and Flower&#x27;s early schemes.

===Derivation and evolution===
Both Shimansky and Kummel derive the Nautilida from the Oncocerida with either the Acleistoceratidae or Brevicoceratidae (Teichert 1988) which share some similarities with the Rutoceratidae as the source. The Rutoceratidae are the ancestral family of the Tainocerataceae and of the Nautilida (Kummel 1964) and of Shimansky&#x27;s and Teichert&#x27;s Rutoceratina. 
The Tainocerataceae gave rise, probably through the ancestral Rutoceratidae, to the Trigonocerataceae and Clydonautiliaceae in the Devonian and to the Aipocerataceae early in the Carboniferous. The Trigonocerataceae, in turn, gave rise late in the Triassic through the Syringonautilidae to the Nautilaceae, which include the Nautilidae, with &quot;Nautilus&quot;. (Kummel 1964)

==Diversity and evolutionary history==
The Nautilida are thought to be derived from either of the oncocerid families, Acleistoceratidae or Brevicoceratidae (Kummel 1964; Teichert 1988), both of which have the same sort of shells and internal structure as found in the Devonian Rutocerina of Shimanskiy, the earliest true nautilids. Flower (1950) suggested the Nautilida evolved from the Barrandeocerida, an idea he came later to reject in favor of derivation from the Oncocerida. The idea that the Nautilida evolved from straight-shelled (&quot;Orthoceras&quot;) nautiloids, as proposed by Otto Schindewolf in 1942, through transitional forms such as the Ordovician &quot;Lituites&quot; can be rejected out of hand as evolutionarily unlikely. &quot;Lituites&quot; and the Lituitidae are derived tarphycerids and belong to a separate evolutionary branch of nautilioids.

The number of nautilid genera increased from the Early Devonian to about 22 in the Middle Devonian. During this time, their shells were more varied than those found in species of living &quot;Nautilus&quot;, ranging from curved (cyrtoconic), through loosely coiled (gyroconic), to tightly coiled forms, represented by the Rutoceratidae, Tetragonoceratidae, and Centroceratidae.

Nautilids declined in the Late Devonian, but again diversified in the Carboniferous, when some 75 genera and subgenera in some 16 families are known to have lived. Although there was considerable diversity in form, curved and loosely coiled shells are rare or absent, except in the superfamily Aipocerataceae. For the rest, nautilids adapted the standard planispiral shell form, although not all were as tightly coiled as the modern nautilids (Teichert 1988). There was, however, a great diversity in surface ornamentation, cross section, and so on, with some genera, such as the Permian &quot;Cooperoceras&quot; and &quot;Acanthonautilus&quot;, developing large lateral spikes (Fenton and Fenton 1958).

Despite again decreasing in diversity in the Permian, nautilids were less affected by the Permian-Triassic extinction than their distant relatives the Ammonoidea. During the Late Triassic there was a tendency in the Clydonautilaceae to develop sutures similar to those of some Late Devonian goniatites. Only a single genus, &quot;Cenoceras&quot;, with a shell similar to that of the modern nautilus, survived the less severe Triassic extinction, at which time the entire Nautiloidea almost became extinct.

For the remainder of the Mesozoic, nautilids once again flourished, although never at the level of their Paleozoic glory, and 24 genera are known from the Cretaceous. Again, the nautilids were not as affected by the end Cretaceous mass extinction as the Ammonoids that became entirely extinct, possibly because their larger eggs were better suited to survive the conditions of that environment-changing event.

Three families and at least five genera of nautilids are known to have survived this crisis in the history of life. There was a further resurgence during the Paleocene and Eocene, with several new genera, the majority of which had a worldwide distribution. During the Late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, the Hercoglossidae and Aturiidae again developed sutures like those of Devonian goniatites. (Teichert 1988, pp. 43–44)

Miocene nautilids were still fairly widespread, but today the order includes only two genera, &quot;Nautilus&quot; and &quot;Allonautilus&quot;, limited to the southwest Pacific.

The recent decrease in the once worldwide distribution of nautilids is now believed to have been caused by the spread of pinnipeds. From the Oligocene onward, the appearance of pinnipeds in the geological record of a region coincides with the disappearance of nautilids from that region. As a result, nautilids are now limited to their current distribution in the tropical Indo-Pacific ocean, where pinnipeds are absent. The genus &quot;Aturia&quot; seem to have temporarily survive regions where pinnipeds were present through adaptations to fast and agile swimming, but eventually went extinct as well. Predation by short-snouted whales and the development of OMZs, preventing nautilids from retreating into deeper water, are also cited as other potential causes of extinction.

<doc id="621549" wikidata="Q423794" url="?curid=621549" title="Base level">
<text>In geology and geomorphology a base level is the lower limit for an erosion process. The modern term was introduced by John Wesley Powell in 1875. The term was subsequently appropriated by William Morris Davis who used it in his cycle of erosion theory. The &quot;ultimate base level&quot; is the surface that results from projection of the sea level under landmasses. It is to this base level that topography tends to approach due to erosion, eventually forming a peneplain close to the end of a cycle of erosion. 

There are also lesser structural base levels where erosion is delayed by resistant rocks. Examples of this include karst regions underlain by insoluble rock. Base levels may be local when large landmasses are far from the sea or disconnected from it, as in the case of endorheic basins. An example of this is the Messinian salinity crisis, in which the Mediterranean Sea dried up making the base level drop more than 1000 m below sea level.

The height of a base level also influences the position of deltas and river terraces. Together with river discharge and sediment flux the position of the base level influences the gradient, width and bed conditions in rivers. A relative drop in base level can trigger re-adjustments in river profiles including knickpoint migration and abandonment of terraces leaving them &quot;hanging&quot;. Base level fall is also known to result in progradation of deltas and river sediment at lakes or sea. If the base level falls below the continental shelf, rivers may form a plain of braided rivers until headward erosion penetrates enough inland from the shelfbreak.

When base levels are stable or rising rivers may aggrade. Rising base levels may also drown the lower courses of rivers creating rias. This happened in the Nile during the Zanclean flood when its lower course became, in a relatively short time, a large estuary extending up to 900 km inland from the Mediterranean coast.

Base level change may be related to the following factors:
#Sea level change
#Tectonic movement
#River capture 
#Extensive sedimentation

<text>Carole Hersee (born 25 November 1958) is an English costume designer who is best known for appearing in the centrepiece of the United Kingdom television Test Card F (and latterly J, W, and X), which aired on BBC Television from 1967 to 1998. As such, she became the most aired face in British television history.

== Test Card F ==

The card was developed in 1967 by her father, BBC engineer George Hersee, who started by snapping test photographs of Carole and her younger sister, Gillian; Carole believes she was ultimately chosen to appear on the card simply because Gillian was without two of her front teeth at the time. However, in an interview with Andy Emmerson in 1988 George recollects photographing both, but the committee chose Carole as she had lighter hair. Someone noticed Carole appeared to be left-handed, so to make it seem that she was holding the chalk in her right hand they flipped the transparency. She was posed with a strategically placed Noughts and Crosses board (the &quot;X&quot; painted in the left centre square was directly in the middle of the screen) and her own clown doll named Bubbles, which was brought on set specifically for the photo shoot. She was paid £100 for the shoot. The card (actually a 35mm transparency) was used on television in the UK and elsewhere for more than four decades, usually while there was no on-air programming.

Because of the card&#x27;s prolonged exposure on the BBC, Hersee received fan mail during her teenage years and was regularly contacted by media outlets for interviews, but she quickly grew tired of the publicity. According to a November 2006 article featuring test card enthusiast Keith Hamer, Hersee is in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; for the longest television appearance in history — an estimated total of 70,000 hours, equivalent to nearly eight continuous years. However, she denied this in a May 2007 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; saying, &quot;[It] can&#x27;t be put in the Guinness Book of Records because it isn&#x27;t a record that somebody else can achieve, apparently&quot;. Hersee still owns the Bubbles doll, which she keeps stored inside a box.

On the 2006–2007 television series &quot;Life on Mars&quot;, Hersee was depicted as a fictional character called the Test Card Girl, played by Rafaella Hutchinson in series one and by Harriet Rogers in series two. Appearing to the protagonist in brief visions, she would often taunt Sam Tyler (John Simm) and occasionally scare him greatly. She is the final character seen in the series when she mimes turning a switch at the side of the screen and the image disappears, similar to an old television set.

== Career ==
Hersee attended Heath End School in Farnham, and as an adult became a seamstress for a supplier of theatrical costumes. She has designed costumes for several West End theatre productions and films, including &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Liaisons.&quot;

<doc id="621563" wikidata="Q379382" url="?curid=621563" title="Rajshahi Division">
<text>Rajshahi Division () is one of the eight first-level administrative divisions of Bangladesh. It has an area of and a population at the 2022 Census of 20,353,119. Rajshahi Division consists of 8 districts, 70 Upazilas (the next lower administrative tier) and 1,092 Unions (the lowest administrative tier).

The region has historically been dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars. Formerly comprising 16 districts, a new division (Rangpur Division) was formed with the 8 northern districts of the old Rajshahi Division from early 2010.

==Etymology and names==
The Rajshahi Division is named after Rajshahi District. Dominated by various feudal Rajas, Maharajas and Zamindars of mixed origins throughout history, the name is a compound of the words &quot;Raj&quot; and &quot;Shahi&quot;, both of which can be translated into reign or kingdom. Archaic spellings in the English language also included &quot;Rajeshae&quot;.

==History==
Rajshahi Division was created in 1829 by the British Government. It was the largest division in Bengal Province. During partition of Bengal in 1947, the division was partitioned in two halves. The eastern half remained as Rajshahi division, while its western half became Jalpaiguri division of West Bengal, India. In January 2010 the Rangpur Division split out from Rajshahi division.

<doc id="621565" wikidata="Q7199732" url="?curid=621565" title="Pixie Day">
<text>Pixie Day is a tradition that takes place in Ottery St. Mary, England, annually on the Saturday nearest Mid-Summer&#x27;s Day in June. Dating from 1954, and based on a pamphlet written by R. F. Delderfield for the 500th anniversary of the installation of the bells of the Church of St. Mary, the event commemorates a legend of Ottery St. Mary&#x27;s &#x27;pixies&#x27; being banished from the town (where they caused havoc) to a local cave known as &#x27;Pixies&#x27; Parlour&#x27;.

The celebrations begin in the early afternoon when a large fête takes place on the Land of Caanan park. At 6 pm the celebrations focus on Ottery&#x27;s town square. Hundreds of &#x27;pixies&#x27; (made up of local Cubs and Brownies dressed in pixie attire) capture the St. Mary&#x27;s church bell ringers and drag them from the church to the Land of Canaan, where a reenactment of the pixies&#x27; banishment takes place.
== The legend ==
As told in Delderfield&#x27;s &quot;The pixies&#x27; revenge; or, the threat to the bells of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Ottery&quot;, the story states that hundreds of years ago, in the early days of Christianity, the people of East Devon used to believe in pixies and spirits. A local bishop, Bishop Grandisson, decided to build a church in Otteri (later Ottery St. Mary), and commissioned a set of bells for the church to be cast in iron in the bells works in Wales. The bishop was so concerned about the bells getting destroyed that he organised an escort of monks to bring the bells to Otteri.

On hearing of this, the pixies were worried, as they knew that once the bells were installed in the church, it would be the death knell of their rule over the land. So they cast a spell over the monks and redirected them from the Otteri road, towards the road leading them to cliffs overlooking the sea at Sidmouth. Just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff, one of them stubbed his toe on a rock and said &quot;God bless my soul&quot;, and immediately the spell was broken.

The bells were then brought to Otteri and installed in the church. However the pixie spell was not completely broken; each year on a day in June the &#x27;pixies&#x27; come out and capture the town&#x27;s bell ringers (and in some years the parish council) and imprison them in Pixies&#x27; Parlour to be rescued by the Vicar of Ottery St. Mary. This legend is re-enacted each year by the Cub and Brownie groups of Ottery St. Mary.

The original Pixies&#x27; Parlour (a cave in sandstone) can be found along the banks of the River Otter, about a mile south of the Otter Road bridge in Ottery St. Mary.

<doc id="621566" wikidata="Q1263388" url="?curid=621566" title="Ducati Monster">
<text>The Ducati Monster is a standard, or naked bike, motorcycle designed by Miguel Angel Galluzzi and produced by Ducati in Bologna, Italy, since 1993. In 2005, Monster sales accounted for over half of Ducati&#x27;s worldwide sales. Like most modern Ducati motorcycles, it has a 90° V-twin engine, called an L-twin by Ducati, with desmodromic valves, and tubular steel trellis frame, designed by Fabio Taglioni (1920–2001).

The Monster line has had numerous variations over the years, from entry level bikes up to top-of-the-line multivalve, water-cooled superbike-engined versions, with as many as nine different Monster versions in a single model year. The Monster&#x27;s elemental simplicity has also made it a favorite platform for custom motorcycle builders, showcased at competitions like the Monster Challenge. Monsters eventually accounted for two-thirds or more of Ducati&#x27;s output.

British weekly newspaper &quot;Motorcycle News&quot; commented in December 2016: &quot;The Monster has gone down in folklore as &#x27;the bike that saved Ducati&#x27; due to its popularity and cheap development costs&quot;, adding that approximately 300,000 had been produced.

==History==

===Conception and design===
The Monster began as a styling exercise in 1992. The concept for the Monster was one Galluzzi had been thinking about for some time, and it took time to convince the management at Cagiva and Ducati to build it. Ducati technical director Massimo Bordi originated the idea for what they wanted the new bike to accomplish, and assigned the design to Galluzzi. Bordi said he asked Galluzzi &quot;for something which displayed a strong Ducati heritage but which was easy to ride and not a sports bike. He came up with a proposal and I thought, this was the bike Marlon Brando would be riding today in the film &quot;The Wild One&quot;!&quot; Bordi&#x27;s intent was to enter the cruiser market, with a bike that was made to be modified and would eventually have a wealth of bolt-on aftermarket accessories rivaling the range of custom and hot-rod parts available for Harley-Davidsons. Previously Cagiva had attempted to move into this market with a cruiser, the Ducati Indiana of 1986–1990. Some sources stated that it made poor use of Ducati&#x27;s desmodromic valve V-twin engines; and a full-cradle frame, not Ducati&#x27;s signature trellis, playing against Ducati&#x27;s stylistic strengths. Only 2,138 were made over four years. The Monster appealed to the same urban, style-conscious buyers who wanted a bike that could make an individualistic statement, but it did so with a motorcycle that they had not quite seen before, and was still unmistakably Italian and a Ducati.

Because Bordi wanted Galluzzi to keep costs low, the Monster was a humble &quot;parts bin special,&quot; built not with newly designed components carefully engineered to work in unison, but by mixing and matching parts from existing Ducati models, beginning with the engine and of a 900 Supersport, a frame descended from the 851 superbike, and the fork of a 750 Supersport. Galluzzi penned a &quot;muscular&quot; fuel tank and minimalist bodywork that produced a visual impression of mass and strength, on a motorcycle that turned out to be surprisingly tiny and agile to the first time rider. &quot;Motorcycle Consumer News&quot; design columnist Glynn Kerr described the Monster&#x27;s statement as aggressive, &quot;attributable to the head-down, charging bull stance.&quot; The trellis frame in the Ducati Monster is an integral part of the motorcycle&#x27;s design allowing for both aesthetic appeal and for structural efficiency.

===1990s===

Ducati introduced three Monster models in its first generation: the M600, M750, and M900 (the numbers denote engine sizes). The first M900 was shipped in 1993, the M600 shipped in 1994, and finally the M750 arrived in 1996. In 1998 Ducati introduces its Monster Dark range of motorcycles with the release of the M600 Dark.
In 1999, to close out existing stock of Monster parts, Ducati released several limited edition Monsters many with different levels of accessories, the most notable was the Monster City, which came in a unique blue color and had leather briefcase style saddlebags and higher handlebars.

From 1994, a smaller displacement model, the M400, was built for specific markets where the tax or license system is particularly harsh on larger capacity or more powerful motorcycles. The M400 was mainly intended for Italy, Japan, and Singapore but was also exported to regions such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand. The M400 was based on the M600 with the same basic engine components, but a shorter stroke crankshaft and smaller diameter pistons.

===2000s===

The bike remained relatively unchanged until 2000, when Ducati added fuel injection to the M900 model. Perhaps more importantly, in 2001 Ducati introduced the S4, which added the liquid-cooled four-valve Superbike engine to the stable. Other technical changes that year included semi-floating front disc brakes with Brembo four-piston calipers, lighter Brembo wheels as well as 43 mm Showa inverted forks. That same year also included upgraded instrumentation with the addition of a tachometer on all Monster models. 2002 saw the introduction of the limited, 300 edition, high-spec, S4, named after four time Ducati Superbike Champion, Carl &#x27;Foggy&#x27; Fogarty.

2003 saw the S4R arrive with the 996 engine, and twin high rise mufflers on the right hand side with a single sided swingarm along with an increase in power (113HP) and torque over the 916-powered S4. &quot;Motorcycle Sport &amp; Leisure&quot; commented that, at the time of introduction, it was &quot;...the most powerful naked bike ever produced by the Italian firm...&quot;.

In November 2005, a new top of the range model was announced: the S4RS Testastretta. This new model uses the engine from the 999 Superbike with Öhlins suspension front and rear and radial front brakes. Also in 2005, Ducati added the S2R Desmodue (two-valved Desmodromic engine) line to the Monster family: styled akin to the four-valve S4R, but with the simpler two-valve 800 cc and 1,000 cc motors in the S2R 800 and S2R 1000, respectively. February 2006 marked the announcement of the 2007 Monster 695. It replaced the Monster 620 and was introduced June 2006.

The Monster 696 was announced in November 2007, 
and officially launched early April 2008 in Barcelona. Its 696 V-twin has the highest power output per cc of any Ducati air-cooled engine. The Monster 1100 was announced in September 2008. Based on the Monster 696, it comes with a larger 1078 cc engine, a single sided swingarm, radial brake calipers, larger forks and taller suspension. 
In 2009, Ducati sold over 12,000 696 models, the first of their motorcycles to sell over 10,000 bikes in one year. 
The 1100 S model has fully adjustable Öhlins suspension components, a different colour scheme and aluminium brake disc carriers, which account for a 1 kg weight reduction.

===2010s===
In April 2010, the Monster 796 was announced, producing a factory-claimed .

In November 2010, Ducati announced the Monster 1100 Evo, replacing the Monster 1100 and 1100s. The exhaust was moved to the side as opposed to underneath the seat, and the dry clutch changed for a wet clutch. Also, there was a change in the paint schemes. Another major change is the inclusion of Ducati Safety Package (DSP) which is standard with the motorcycle. This DSP consists of ABS and Ducati Traction Control.

In October 2011, Ducati unveiled a new addition to the Monster family, the 795. Essentially a 696 frame with the larger 803cc engine from the 796, the 795 is aimed specifically at the Asian market and assembled in a plant in Thailand.

In November 2013 at EICMA, Ducati introduced the 2014 Monster 1200 and 1200 S, with a watercooled four valve 135/145 hp 1198 Testastretta 11 engine. It replaced the Monster 1100 Evo.

The 796 was replaced by the Monster 821 in mid 2014, equipped with the 821 cc Testastretta from the hyper line, and incorporating the same electronics suite as the monster 1200.

In 2016 the new Monster 1200 R was added. Ducati said it was the most powerful Monster ever, with a more track-oriented design. Ducati claimed the engine produced torque, and , more than the Monster 1200 S. It has the same Testastretta 11° DS, 90-degree V-twin used in the Multistrada and Diavel. It has an Öhlins suspension front and rear and a wheelbase compared to for the S model. The claimed wet weight is . The rear tire has a 200-section, somewhat greater than the 1200 S&#x27;s 190 width.

Ducati first showed the Monster 797 at the 2016 EICMA Motor Show in Milan, positioning it as the new entry level Monster. Sales in most markets began that year, expanding to India in 2017. It has a 803 cc, Desmodue, twin-cylinder, air-cooled engine. It has a 6-speed gearbox.

===2020s===
On December 2, 2020, four new models were announced, the all-new 2021 Ducati Monster, Ducati Monster Plus, Ducati Monster 1200 and Ducati Monster 1200s. The base Monster had with the 937 cc Testastretta 11° V-twin engine. The Ducati Monster 1200 and 1200 S is equipped with a 1198 cc Testastretta 11° V-twin engine. The 1200 S has an Öhlins suspension, 330 mm front brake discs with higher-spec Brembo calipers and light weight wheels.

<doc id="621568" wikidata="Q537432" url="?curid=621568" title="Joe Perry (snooker player)">
<text>Joe Perry (born 13 August 1974) is an English professional snooker player from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. Nicknamed &quot;the Gentleman&quot;, Perry climbed the rankings steadily after turning professional in 1992 and reached the Top 16 for the first time in 2002.

His first ranking final came at the 2001 European Open and he had to wait another 13 years for a second which came at the 2014 Wuxi Classic. Perry won his first ranking title at the 2015 Players Championship Grand Final, at the age of 40 and in his 23rd season as a professional. He also won the minor-ranking 2013 Yixing Open and 2015 Xuzhou Open.

Perry reached the final of a Triple Crown tournament for the first time at the Masters in 2017, losing 7–10 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Perry previously reached the UK Championship semi-finals in 2004 and 2005, and the semi-finals of the World Championship in 2008.

Perry claimed his second ranking title at the 2022 Welsh Open by defeating Judd Trump 9–5 in the final. This made him, at age 47, the second-oldest player to win a ranking title, after Ray Reardon, who was aged 50 when he won his final ranking event in 1982. However, Mark Williams subsequently won the 2023 British Open at age 48, making Perry the third-oldest ranking event winner.

Perry is a commentator for the BBC.

==Career==
===2001–2005===
Perry&#x27;s breakthrough came when he reached the final of the European Open in 2001. He first reached the quarter-finals of the World Championship in 2004, beating then defending champion Mark Williams 13–11 along the way, also making the tournament&#x27;s highest break of 145 (which remains Perry&#x27;s best in competition, only equaled in the Northern Ireland Open 2023), before losing to Matthew Stevens. He repeated this run in 2008 when he defeated Graeme Dott and Stuart Bingham, and bettered it by going on to beat Stephen Maguire 13–12 and earn his place in the semi-finals, which he narrowly lost to Ali Carter. Previously, he had also reached the last 16 on his Crucible debut in 1999, beating Steve Davis on the final black in the last 32.

He reached the semi-finals of the UK Championship in both 2004 and 2005. The 2004 defeat was especially notable as Perry had led 8–7 and potted a colour to leave his opponent, David Gray, requiring a snooker – however, Perry&#x27;s pot had also left him snookered on the final red, which he failed to hit, allowing Gray to clear the table and ultimately win the deciding frame with a total clearance of 139. This run left Perry provisionally fifth in the world, but he failed to win a match in the remaining five tournaments and dropped to 14th at the end of the season as a result. In 2005, he lost to eventual champion Ding Junhui.

===2007–2010===
In the 2007–08 season, Perry reached two quarter-finals: in the Grand Prix (losing 3–5 to Gerard Greene) and the Welsh Open (with victories over John Parrott 5–2, Peter Ebdon 5–1 and Stuart Bingham 5–2 before Shaun Murphy beat him 5–0), as well as the last 16 of the UK Championship, where he beat Neil Robertson 9–6 after being 3–5 down, before losing 2–9 to Marco Fu. He followed that up by reaching the semi-finals of the world championship, where he was knocked out by Ali Carter 15–17. These results ensured him a return to the prestigious top 16 of the rankings (at No. 12, his highest ranking ever), meaning automatic qualification for major tournaments.
He also finished the 2007/2008 season on another high, by winning the Championship League, to qualify for the Betfred Premier League for 2008. He has said he feels that he is learning to cope with the high pressure of major tournaments, having had more experience over the last season.

Perry opened 2008–09 with three last-sixteen runs, leaving him inside the top eight of the provisional rankings. However he went one better in the 2008 UK Championship beating Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 9–5 having trailed by 3–5, in one of the best victories of his career. However, he lost 7–9 to Marco Fu in the quarter-finals. In the new year, he suffered a narrow 5–6 loss to O&#x27;Sullivan in the Masters; the rest of the season was unspectacular as he failed to win a match in a ranking event. He was unable to repeat his 2008 run in the World Championship, losing 6–10 to an in-form Jamie Cope in the first round. This meant that he finished the season ranked at number 12. In 2009–10 he only reached one quarter-final and consequently slid to 19th in the rankings. In the World Championship he beat Michael Holt in the first round 10–4, and trailed Ali Carter 6–10 before winning five frames in a row to lead 11–10 but lost 11–13.

===2011–2013===
Perry was a losing finalist in Event 1 (Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan won 4–0) and Event 12 (Stephen Maguire won 4–2) during the minor-ranking 2011/2012 Players Tour Championship series. These results helped him qualify for the Finals as he finished 11th on the Order of Merit. It was at the Finals where Perry had his best run in a ranking event during the 2011–12 season as he beat Fergal O&#x27;Brien and Graeme Dott, before being defeated by Neil Robertson 1–4 in the quarter-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2011/12&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the other ranking events during the year he reached the second round three times, culminating in a 7–13 defeat to Maguire in the World Championship. Perry finished the season ranked world number 24. He began the 2012–13 season by reaching the second round of the Wuxi Classic thanks to the withdrawal of Matthew Stevens and lost 4–5 to Ricky Walden.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He was beaten 1–5 by Marco Fu in the first round of the Australian Goldfields Open, before recording his best result of the year at the Shanghai Masters. He beat Barry Pinches in qualifying, Stevens 5–2 in the first round and then whitewashed Neil Robertson 5–0 to make the quarter-finals. There was never a frame between Perry and Mark Williams in their quarter-final, with Perry making a 131 break to force a deciding frame which he lost. He won two more matches in ranking events during the rest of the season, the first being a 4–0 triumph over world number one Mark Selby in the first round of the Welsh Open.

He was knocked out 3–4 by veteran Alan McManus in the subsequent round. The second was in the PTC Finals which Perry had qualified for by finishing 20th on the Order of Merit. He beat Stuart Bingham 4–2, before losing 3–4 to Ben Woollaston. Perry&#x27;s season ended when he was beaten 3–10 by world number 83 Sam Baird in the final round of World Championship Qualifying. His end of season ranking was world number 20.

===First title===
In June 2013, Perry won the first minor-ranking title of his 22-year professional career at the opening event of the Players Tour Championship, the Yixing Open, with a 4–1 defeat of Mark Selby in the final. A week later, he outplayed Ding Junhui in the second round of the Wuxi Classic to win 5–1 and then beat David Gilbert 5–2 in the following round, before being defeated 2–5 by John Higgins in the quarter-finals. Another quarter-final followed at the Australian Goldfields Open, where he was eliminated 2–5 by home favourite Neil Robertson.

Perry won a quarter-final at the third time of asking this season at the International Championship with a 6–1 victory over Ryan Day.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His semi-final match against Marco Fu was extremely close and involved long spells of tactical play, as many frames lasted 40 minutes, which Fu edged 9–8 on the colours. He also participated in the 2013 World Games in Cali, Colombia, where he represented the UK. He won his first game against Brendan O&#x27;Donoghue but subsequently lost in the quarter-finals to eventual gold medalist Aditya Mehta.
Perry&#x27;s good play continued into 2014 as he advanced to the quarter-finals of the German Masters with the loss of just three frames, but he then lost 2–5 to Ding Junhui. He secured an impressive 5–1 win over Selby in the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, stating that his newfound casual approach to the game was a key reason for his successful season. However, it was Ding who once again halted his run in a ranking event as he beat Perry 6–4. A sixth quarter-final appearance of the season came at the PTC Finals, but he lost 2–4 to Judd Trump. He fought back from 3–6 down after the opening session of his first round match with Jamie Burnett at the World Championship to win 10–7 and set up a second round clash with reigning champion Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. Perry started the better of the two as he established a 5–3 lead after the opening session and maintained his two-frame advantage after the second, although he missed a chance in the final frame to be 10–6 ahead. He went on to lead 11–9, before O&#x27;Sullivan leveled the match and then made back-to-back century breaks to win 13–11, with Perry remarking afterwards that he had been &quot;blown away by a genius&quot; in the last few frames.

Perry said that if he could maintain his own attitude and mindset he would win his first major ranking title in the future. He ended the campaign as the world number 15, inside the top 16 for the first time in five years.

===Major success===

At the 2014 Wuxi Classic, Perry dropped just four frames to reach the semi-finals and then beat Martin Gould 6–4 to reach his second career ranking final and the first in 13 years. He played friend and practice partner Neil Robertson and from 6–8 down won three unanswered frames to stand on the edge of his first ranking title, but Robertson then made breaks of 87 and 78 to edge Perry out 10–9. Afterwards, Robertson suggested that Perry&#x27;s talent should see him become a top 10 player in the future. Perry failed to advance beyond the last 32 in the next four ranking events.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Perry defeated Ding Junhui 6–3 in the first round of the Masters, his first ever win in the tournament, but then lost 4–6 to Mark Allen with both players missing a catalogue of easy balls during the match which Allen described as &quot;a comedy of errors&quot; afterwards. However, less than a week later, Perry won the Xuzhou Open by beating Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 4–1 in the final to claim his second Asian Tour title in as many years.

Perry&#x27;s form on the PTC circuit saw him seeded seventh for the Grand Final in Bangkok, Thailand. He defeated Ding Junhui 4–1, Anthony McGill 4–3 from 1–3 down, and Michael Holt and Stuart Bingham 4–1 each to reach his third major ranking final and second of the season. He recovered from 0–3 down against Mark Williams to win 4–3 and claim the first major title of his 23-year playing career, in addition to his highest prize earning of £100,000 and a place inside the world&#x27;s top ten. When Perry finished the season at ninth in the rankings it marked his highest year-end ranking to date.

A pair of 5–3 wins over Jamie Burnett and Robert Milkins helped Perry to the quarter-finals of the 2015 Australian Goldfields Open, where he was on the wrong end of a 5–3 scoreline against John Higgins.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; His second quarter-final of the 2015–16 season was also against Higgins at the International Championship and he recovered from 0–4 down to make it 3–5, but then lost the next frame. Perry&#x27;s ranking event title from last season saw him make his debut in the Champion of Champions and he beat Michael White 4–2 to face Higgins in the quarter-finals once again. There was never more than a frame between the two players and Perry came from 4–5 down to triumph 6–5. In the semi-finals he lost 6–4 to Neil Robertson.Robertson|Check Details

After losing 3–6 to Robbie Williams in the second round of the 2015 UK Championship, Perry called his opponent&#x27;s style and speed of play &quot;a joke&quot;. At the Welsh Open he beat Judd Trump 4–3 in the fourth round and Ben Woollaston 5–1 in the quarter-finals to meet Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-finals. He made a 139 break during the match, but lost it 3–6. A second major event semi-final soon followed at the World Grand Prix as he conceded just two frames in eliminating Barry Hawkins (Perry&#x27;s 133 won him the high break prize), Kyren Wilson and Ali Carter. Stuart Bingham was never ahead of Perry until the frame as he squandered a 3–0 lead to be defeated 5–6. In an extremely tight World Championship first round match, he was edged out 9–10 by Wilson.

A 6–2 success over Neil Robertson saw Perry advance to the final of the 2016 World Open, where he lost 8–10 to Ali Carter. He also saw off Robertson 6–2 to reach the quarter-finals of the International Championship and was defeated 3–6 by Mark Selby.&lt;ref name=&quot;2016/17&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Perry was knocked out 2–6 by Matthew Stevens in the third round of the UK Championship.

At the 2017 Masters a pair of 6–1 victories over Stuart Bingham and Ding Junhui saw Perry play in the semi-finals of the event for the first time. He was 2–5 behind Barry Hawkins and needed a snooker in the next frame, but managed to get it and take the frame. The tie went to a deciding frame in which Perry was 50 points down, but he stepped in to make a break of 70 and reach the final of a Triple Crown tournament for the first time. He said his plan for the final was to get in front of Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan and stay in front of him and he started well by leading 4–1. However, O&#x27;Sullivan then reeled off a match defining seven frames in a row and went on to win 10–7. Afterwards, Perry said he had failed to handle the pressure of having a lead in such a big match. He lost 3–4 in the quarter-finals of the World Grand Prix to Liang Wenbo and could not qualify for the World Championship as, after coming back from 6–9 down, he was defeated 9–10 by Akani Songsermsawad. 
At the 2018 World Championship, he defeated defending champion Mark Selby 10–4 in the first round.

Perry claimed his second ranking title at the 2022 Welsh Open by defeating Judd Trump 9–5 in the final. He called winning the tournament &quot;the absolute highlight of my career by a country mile.&quot; Aged 47, he became the second-oldest player to win a ranking title, after Ray Reardon, who was aged 50 when he won his final ranking event in 1982.

== Personal life ==
Perry suffers from ankylosing spondylitis. Before it was correctly diagnosed, he was considering giving up the sport: &quot;I told my wife I was thinking about packing it in because I couldn’t take it any more. I felt there was no point me flying overseas then not being able to even practise, and losing matches.&quot;

Perry is a supporter of Arsenal F.C.
