<text>Tron 2.0 is a first-person shooter video game developed by Monolith Productions and published by Buena Vista Interactive. The Microsoft Windows version of the game was released in August 2003. The Mac OS X version was released by MacPlay on April 21, 2004. The game is a sequel to &quot;Tron&quot;, a 1982 science-fiction film, although it is set in an alternate continuity since its events were decanonized by &quot;&quot;.

Jason Cottle voices the player character Jethro &quot;Jet&quot; Bradley, the son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley (voiced by Bruce Boxleitner, who reprises his role from the original film). Cindy Morgan, who also starred in &quot;Tron&quot;, voices the artificial intelligence &quot;Ma3a&quot;. Rebecca Romijn provides the voice of Mercury. The game features a new &quot;light cycle&quot; design by Syd Mead, and provides explanations for the &quot;Tron&quot; arcade game (which makes an appearance in this game) and Kevin Flynn&#x27;s experiences inside the ENCOM mainframe as shown in the original film.

According to &quot;Tron&quot; creator Steven Lisberger and &quot;&quot; director Joseph Kosinski, &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; is not part of the &quot;Tron&quot; movie canon.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Tron 2.0&quot; plays primarily as a first-person shooter. Gameplay takes place inside various computers, such as mainframes and a personal digital assistant (PDA), while some custcenes are in the ENCOM research laboratory outside the computer world. Levels are linear in format. The goal of each level is generally to complete tasks and find keys, known as permission bits that allow access to the next level. While searching for these bits the protagonist, Jet, can find upgrades and lore surrounding the game&#x27;s world.

Jet begins the game with his Identity Disc, which is used for both storing data and for combat. The disc is the same format featured in the films, and when thrown can bounce off enemies and objects, but always returns to its owner. Jet can also acquire computerized versions of real-life weapons, such as a shotgun, submachine gun, sniper rifle, and hand grenades. Each weapon aside from the disc uses energy as ammunition, which can be collected at various points in the game.

Jet&#x27;s abilities are customizable, as his in-computer program earns version upgrades - when earning a level, Jet 0.0.0 becomes Jet 0.0.1, and so on. He acquires new abilities, and also the aforementioned weapons, in the form of subroutines held in archive bins scattered around the levels, but has a limited number of memory slots in which to install these subroutines onto his person. Subroutines start out as alpha-grade software, but can be upgraded to beta and gold statuses, similar to a software release life cycle. Status upgrades both take up less space in memory and become more effective. The layout of Jet&#x27;s memory slots changes from level to level, with immovable &quot;base code&quot; taking up various slots and limiting the number and size of the abilities Jet can equip. When attacked by viruses, subroutines can become fragmented or infected and cannot be used until Jet repairs them. If Jet encounters a program unknown to him, he can import one of its unique abilities to his own system.

As he moves through the levels, Jet must engage many lower-tier enemies. Although none are particularly powerful, they usually appear in gangs, making them more of a threat. Among the regular levels, there are some with boss enemies. Interspersed with the first-person-shooter levels are several light cycle races. As seen in the movie, these races are actually arena duels in which each light cycle attempts to destroy its opponents by driving them into its jetwall. The arenas contain improvements, such as speed zones that affect the cycles&#x27; speed, more complex layouts with walls and other artifacts, and power-ups that can be collected during races. In addition to Tron&#x27;s regular light cycle, Jet can also gain access to the super light cycle that sports a more modern design and offers more speed.

&quot;Tron 2.0&quot; offers some multiplayer scenarios, both in campaign mode and in light cycle mode. Internet and LAN play are available, although the vendor does not recommend that the light cycle mode be used over the Internet due to its generally high lag.

==Setting==
The game, like the film, is set &quot;inside&quot; a computer. Areas within the game feature glowing neon-colored highlights similar to the original film&#x27;s aesthetic, with colors denoting the type and general ambiance of the system - for example, part of the story takes place in the flaming red environment of a firewall, while a PDA is colored plain white. Levels contain such features as energy bridges and gates, floating boxes and tiles, teleport spots, and deep chasms. Jet can take damage (or even die) by falling from too great a height, and can also be crushed by falling objects and moving platforms.

Like the film, &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; uses many computing conventions to explain in-game events, characters, weapons, and other phenomena. For example, players battle viruses while fleeing a system format, and wield a sniper rifle known as the LOL, additionally amplifying its damage with a skill called Megahurtz. Programs in the systems bear various names based on their functions, including names based on their creators (like &quot;Brian.exe&quot;), system tools (e.g. &quot;servwatch.exe&quot;), parodies of popular software (e.g. &quot;reelplyr.exe&quot; and &quot;netscope.exe&quot;), and viruses and malware scripts (&quot;HA-HA-HA-0X0-&gt;???&quot;, &quot;Durandal&quot; and &quot;(Ra*mpa^ncy)&quot; - the latter two being references to &quot;Marathon&quot;). Datawraiths, which are in essence digitized humans, feature email addresses such as &quot;AndyG@fcon.net&quot; and &quot;GeoffK@fcon.net&quot;. Jet can also find and read e-mail messages in certain systems, which partly reveal the game&#x27;s background story, but also provide insight into the relationships between Alan, Jet, and Ma3a.

===Plot===
The plot of &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; centers around Alan&#x27;s son Jethro &quot;Jet&quot; Bradley. Since the events of &quot;Tron&quot;, ENCOM has been taken over by a company called FCon (Future Control Industries). During a phone conversation between Jet and his father, Alan is kidnapped. Ma3a, an artificial intelligence designed by Alan, digitizes Jet into Alan&#x27;s computer. She informs Jet that she needs him to aid her against J.D. Thorne, an executive from FCon who attempted to digitize himself into the computer as well, but became corrupted during the process and turned into a virus spreading throughout the system.

Upon arriving, Jet is captured by Kernel, the system&#x27;s security program, and is accused of being the source of the corruption. However, Kernel spares Jet on the recommendation of Mercury, a program also tasked to help Ma3a, and sends Jet to the light cycle arena. After winning several matches, Jet escapes the arena with Mercury&#x27;s help. After the two reunite with Ma3a, the server is reformatted due to its rampant corruption, which results in Mercury&#x27;s demise. Jet escapes to the original ENCOM grid with Ma3a and accesses an archive with the help of an antiquated program, I-No, to retrieve the source code for &quot;Tron Legacy&quot;, an update to the original TRON that Alan wrote to protect Ma3a. Jet and Ma3a then access the Internet and find a compiler, which they use to begin compiling the Tron Legacy source code. During the process, Thorne attacks them and appears to kill Ma3a, while Jet receives a communication from Guest, the User who had assigned Mercury to help him. Accessing a video uplink, Jet sees his father trapped inside a storage closet, who holds up a sign telling him to not compile the Legacy program. However, the compile finishes before Jet can abort it, and Legacy activates, revealing that its sole function is to kill all rogue Users in the digital world. Jet escapes in a light cycle, and FCon inadvertently saves him by capturing Ma3a with a Seeker search program.

Having recovered the correction algorithms necessary to digitize a human, Alan is sent to Thorne&#x27;s corrupted server and assists Kernel and his ICPs (Intrusion Countermeasure Programs). Meanwhile, Jet finds Thorne at the heart of the server and confronts Kernel in a duel that ends in Kernel&#x27;s destruction before he can kill Thorne. Thorne, in a moment of lucidity, begs Jet for forgiveness and tells him how to enter FCon&#x27;s server before he dissipates.

Alan and Jet break into FCon&#x27;s server, which the corporation is planning to use to distribute Datawraiths - digitized human hackers - across the worldwide information network for purposes of corporate and international espionage. After Alan and Jet crash the server, the CEO of FCon (which the game implies could be Ed Dillinger, the ENCOM senior executive from the original film) orders Baza, Popoff, and Crowne into the system themselves. Alan, wanting to verify the purity of the correction algorithms, removes them from Ma3a to inspect them. As a result, when the three FCon employees are digitized, they become a monstrous amalgam that chases Jet into the digitizing beam. Jet battles the monster amalgam and ejects the employees out of the beam, releasing their code from the corruption one by one. Severing the CEO&#x27;s control, Alan and Jet extract and save the Tron Legacy code as the ENCOM servers crash. The game ends with Alan planning to reassemble the digitized FCon team and bring them back to the real world.

==Reception==
The PC version received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews, while the Game Boy Advance and Xbox versions received &quot;average&quot; reviews, according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

&quot;The Cincinnati Enquirer&quot; gave the PC version four-and-a-half stars out of five and said: &quot;Whether or not you&#x27;re a fan of the movie, &quot;TRON 2.0&quot; oozes with style and substance. Developer Monolith Productions deserves credit for creating one of the finest and most unique PC games of the year to date&quot;. &quot;Maxim&quot; gave the same console version a score of eight out of ten and called it &quot;a must for those out there who still like their CGI old school&quot;. However, &quot;The Times&quot; gave the Xbox version three stars out of five, saying that &quot;the controls take some time to master, and there&#x27;s a surfeit of useless jargon seemingly designed to prevent you getting to grips with the gameplay. Nor is this a game for the short-sighted, since the on-screen captions that supposedly offer guidance are minute and virtually illegible&quot;.

Despite the good reviews, the PC version underperformed in sales and BVG eventually dropped support for the game two years after it was released. Despite the lack of support from BVG, additional levels and multiplayer maps have been developed by fans of the game, including an expansion game and modification.

Slave Labor Graphics produced a &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; comic book sequel miniseries called &quot;&quot;.

&quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; named &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; the fourth-best computer game of 2003, and presented it with awards for &quot;Best Sound Effects&quot; and &quot;Best Art Direction&quot;, the latter of which it shared with &quot;&quot;. The editors called &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; &quot;easily one of the year&#x27;s best looking games, and a textbook example of how graphics rely just as much on art design as they do technology&quot;. The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; nominated &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; for their 2003 &quot;Shooter of the Year&quot; and overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, respectively. It was also nominee for &quot;PC Gamer US&quot;″s 2003 &quot;Best Action Game&quot; award, although it lost again to &quot;Call of Duty&quot;. The editors declared it &quot;a movie license done right&quot;. During the 7th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Tron 2.0&quot; for &quot;Computer First-Person Action Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Innovation in Computer Gaming&quot;.

In 2009, GamesRadar ranked the game third on their list of the seven best Disney games, saying &quot;Not to discount the gorgeousness of 2.0’s neon lined environments, nor the wonderfully tech savvy 1337 speak [...] but the Light Cycle arenas remain the game’s crown jewel. All the nausea-inducing camera angles and impossible turns of Tron’s deadly game of competitive Snake were preserved, and you could bring the action online where it ran like a fanboy fever dream.&quot;

==Ports==
In addition to the Mac, the game was ported to mobile phones in two versions: the first, called Tron 2.0: Light Cycles, which was released on November 21, 2003; and the second, called Tron 2.0: Discs of Tron, which was released on May 12, 2004. The same game was later ported to the Xbox with significant changes to the single and, especially, the multiplayer modes. The Xbox version is titled Tron 2.0: Killer App. Changes to the single player mode include optional jumping sequences, and overall console-tailored controls. The real changes were made to the multiplayer modes. Added is up to sixteen player multiplayer disc arena, light cycles, or overRide modes for system link or Xbox Live. The new overRide mode allows for first person gameplay with the ability to ride light cycles at any time. There is also a version of &quot;Tron 2.0: Killer App&quot; for the Game Boy Advance that has a different story and gameplay elements from its Xbox counterpart. A version of the game was planned for the Gizmondo, but was canceled during development.

<doc id="612592" wikidata="Q17020232" url="?curid=612592" title="Sleeper agent">
<text>A sleeper agent is a spy or operative who is placed in a target country or organization, not to undertake an immediate mission, but instead to act as a potential asset on short notice if activated in the future. Even if not activated, the &quot;sleeper agent&quot; is still an asset and can still play an active role in sabotage, sedition, espionage, or possibly treason by virtue of agreeing to act if activated. A team of sleeper agents may be referred to as a sleeper cell, possibly working with others in a clandestine cell system.

==Description==

In espionage, a sleeper agent is one who has infiltrated the target country and has &quot;gone to sleep&quot;, sometimes for many years. The agent makes no attempt to communicate with the sponsor or any existing agents or to obtain information beyond what is public, and becomes active only upon receiving a pre-arranged signal or message from the sponsor or a fellow agent.

The agent acquires jobs and identities, ideally ones that will prove useful in the future, and attempts to blend into everyday life as a normal citizen. Counterespionage agencies in the target country cannot, in practice, closely watch all those who may possibly have been recruited some time before.

In a sense, the best sleeper agents are those who do not need to be paid by the sponsor, as they are able to earn enough money to finance themselves, averting any possibly traceable payments from abroad. In such cases, the sleeper agent may be successful enough to become what is sometimes termed an &quot;agent of influence&quot;.

Sleeper agents who have been discovered have often been natives of the target country who moved elsewhere in early life and were co-opted (perhaps for ideological or ethnic reasons) before returning to the target country. That is valuable to the sponsor, as the sleeper&#x27;s language and other skills can be those of a native, thus less likely to trigger domestic suspicion.

Choosing and inserting sleeper agents has often been difficult, as whether the target will be appropriate some years in the future is uncertain. If the sponsor government and its policies change after the sleeper has been inserted, the sleeper may be found to have been planted in the wrong target.

===Examples===
* Jack Barsky was planted as a sleeper agent in the United States by the Soviet KGB. He was an active sleeper agent between 1978 and 1988. He was located by US authorities in 1994 and then arrested in 1997. Barsky quickly confessed after being arrested and became a useful source of information about spy techniques.
* The Illegals Program was a network of sleeper spies planted in the US by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. A multi-year investigation culminated in June 2010 with the filing of charges and the arrest of 10 suspects in the US and another one in Cyprus. The Russian General Directorate for special programs, or GUSP in Russian transliteration (Главное управление специальных программ, ГУСП), still recruits candidates among students and talented scientists to use them as sleeper agents or as legal employees in police and intelligence bodies in Russia.

===Fictional examples===
Sleeper agents are popular plot devices in fiction, particularly in espionage fiction and science fiction. This common use is directly related to and results from repeated instances of real-life &quot;sleeper agents&quot; participating in spying, espionage, sedition, treason, and assassinations.

In fictional portrayals, sleeper agents are sometimes unaware that they are sleepers. They are brainwashed, hypnotized, or otherwise conditioned to be unaware of their secret mission until activated.

====Books and films====
* In &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; (the novel and its film adaptations), some Americans are captured by Soviet intelligence forces, given posthypnotic commands, and returned to their lives in the U.S.
* In the 1977 film &quot;Telefon&quot;, Russian agents believe they are ordinary Americans until their memories are unlocked with a special activation phrase.
* The 1978 book &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot; by Ken Follett and 1981 film of the same name both show how a sleeper agent, Henry Faber (Donald Sutherland), operates in his target country.
* In the 1987 film &quot;No Way Out&quot;, protagonist U.S. naval officer Tom Farrell, played by Kevin Costner, is revealed, in a twist at the end of the film, to be a Soviet spy under deep cover in the USA.
* In the British comedy-drama &quot;Sleepers&quot;, two Russian agents have integrated so well into their lives as British citizens, that when receive their activation signal, they go on the run.
* In the 2010 film &quot;Salt&quot;, a CIA officer goes on the run when accused of being a sleeper agent by a Russian defector.
* The film &quot;Killers&quot;, also released in 2010, has an assassin trying to leave his life as a government operative behind by getting married and living a domestic life, but he is then followed by many killers, who are near the end revealed to be sleeper agents working for his father-in-law, himself a former assassin.
* In the 2012 film &quot;Thuppakki&quot; and its 2014 remake &quot;&quot;, the sleeper cells attack the city of Mumbai.
* The 2013 film &quot;Viswaroopam&quot; has an unravelling plot where the sleeper agents are scraping caesium-137 from oncological equipment to build and trigger a dirty bomb in New York City. The main character, Wisam Ahmed Kashmiri, is also a sleeper agent against Al-Qaeda for RAW, posing as a Hindu Kathak teacher, Viswanathan in New York City. 
* In the 2015 film &quot;American Ultra&quot;, small-town stoner Mike Howell spends most of his time getting high and writing graphic novels. What Mike does not know is that he was trained by the CIA to be a lethal killing machine. When the agency targets him for termination, his former handler activates his latent skills, turning the mild-mannered slacker into a deadly weapon.
* Gustaf Skördeman&#x27;s 2020 book &quot;Geiger&quot; shows a sleeper agent being activated in Sweden during the Cold War.
* The 2021 film &quot;Black Widow&quot; involves Russian sleeper cells in the United States during the Cold War, raising and brainwashing adopted girls, eventually bringing them to Russia, where they are trained to be Black Widow operatives.

====Television====
* The first season of the 2011–2020 series &quot;Homeland&quot; involves a recovered hostage who is accused of being a terrorist sleeper agent.
* The 2013–2018 television series &quot;The Americans&quot; features a pair of KGB agents posing as an average American family. It is set during the Cold War in the 1980s.
* In a season one episode of the modern-day Sherlock Holmes adaptation, &quot;Elementary&quot;, a murder victim and her husband are unmasked as Russian sleeper agents by the main character.

====Video games====
* The main character of the 2010 video game &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; is brainwashed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War, along with others to be sleeper agents and detonate a deadly gas across the US when activated.
*In the 2016 video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s The Division&quot; players take control of a Sleeper Agent looking to protect what remains when New York falls to the &quot;Dollar Virus&quot; sending to the city into a pandemic frenzy.
*The main character of the 2020 video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, in the storyline of its Phantom Liberty expansion pack, activates sleeper agent Solomon Reed by using the deprecated land-line system in order to get help with extracting the president of the New United States of America.
*In &quot;The Outlast Trials&quot;, players control a &quot;Reagent&quot;. They must complete &quot;Trials&quot; within the Sinyala Facility in Arizona during the height of the Cold War to earn their freedom. The game&#x27;s many endings imply the successful transformation of these individuals into sleeper agents; a result of the harsh conditioning experienced through the Trials.

====Music====
*Taylor Swift&#x27;s 2024 song “The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived” includes a line “...were you a sleeper cell spy? In fifty years will all this be declassified?” as a hyperbolic metaphorical explanation for why a man left her abruptly without explanation.

<text>Number 6 Squadron of the Royal Air Force operates the Eurofighter Typhoon FGR.4 at RAF Lossiemouth.
It was previously equipped with the SEPECAT Jaguar GR.3 in the close air support and tactical reconnaissance roles, and was posted to RAF Coltishall, Norfolk until April 2006, moving to RAF Coningsby until disbanding for the first time in its history on 31 May 2007. The squadron officially reformed as a Typhoon squadron on 6 September 2010. No. 6 Squadron is unique in having two Royal standards, having been awarded its second one by King Abdullah I of Jordan in October 1950 due to its long period of service in the Middle East.

==History==
===First World War===

The squadron was formed on 31 January 1914, at Farnborough Aerodrome as No. 6 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps. Its first squadron commander was Major John Becke. The squadron had an initial aircraft inventory of two Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2s and two Farmans, with the squadron also initially incorporating a flight operating man-lifting kites. The squadron, equipped with a mixture of B.E.2s, Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8s and Farmans crossed the English Channel in October 1914 to support IV Corps in its attempt to prevent the Germans from capturing Antwerp. In November, the squadron joined the newly formed 2nd Wing of the RFC, with the role of supporting the Second and Third Corps, taking part in the First Battle of Ypres.

In February 1915, 9 Squadron, an experimental unit equipped with radio equipped aircraft, was split up, with one flight of aircraft going to 6 Squadron and the other to 2 Squadron. The new flight replaced 6 Squadron&#x27;s existing C Flight, which together with flights from 2 Squadron and 5 Squadron, was used to form 16 Squadron. In March 1915, the squadron received two Martinsyde S.1 scouts, to escort the squadrons aircraft, and these were later supplemented by Bristol Scouts in the escort role, while the main part of the squadron used the B.E.2. On 25 July 1915, Captain Lanoe Hawker, flying a Bristol Scout, attacked three German aircraft in succession. The first aerial victory for Hawker that day occurred after he emptied a complete drum of bullets from his aircraft&#x27;s single Lewis machine gun into a German aircraft which went spinning down. The second victory saw a German aircraft driven to the ground damaged, and the third saw a German aircraft – an Albatros C.I of FFA 3 – burst into flames and crash. For this feat he was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The squadron was deployed directing artillery during the Actions of the Bluff near Ypres in February 1916 and the Actions of St Eloi Craters in March–April that year. During the Battle of the Somme from July to November 1916, the squadron carried out bombing attacks, including night bombing operations, against targets in the Ypres salient to prevent the Germans transferring troops to the Somme front. In May 1917, the squadron re-equipped with Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8s. The squadron took part in the Battle of Messines in June 1917, artillery spotting during the preparatory bombardment, and then flying contact patrols. In September 1917, the squadron supported the British Second Army during the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge. In November 1917, the squadron was pulled out of the line and attached to V Corps, which was being held in reserve to exploit a potential breakthrough in the front, and was used to give training on cooperation between aircraft and ground forces to infantry, artillery and staff officers.

===Inter-war years===
Following the Armistice, the squadron transferred to Iraq, arriving in July 1919. Operating in the army co-operation role in Northern Iraq, it was equipped with Bristol Fighters. It was later re-equipped with Fairey Gordons and assumed the bomber role, Hawker Harts replacing these in 1935.

===Second World War===
The squadron relocated to Palestine in 1938, reverting to the army co-operation role with Hawker Hardys, adding Gloster Gauntlets and Westland Lysanders. When hostilities with Italy broke out in June 1940, the squadron deployed one flight of aircraft to Egypt to work with the army, with the remainder of the squadron remained in Palestine. Between September 1940 and September 1943 the squadron saw action in the tank-busting, 40 mm cannon-firing Hawker Hurricane Mk. IID, over the Western Desert.

In the spring of 1944, the squadron moved to a coastal field south-east of Termoli, Italy. The squadron flew Hurricane Mk.IVs equipped with rocket projectiles. Moored Axis ships were attacked at Yugoslav harbours and the Dalmatian islands. They were strongly defended by anti-aircraft gunners on Siebel ferries with their multiple guns, as the ships were being used to supply the German forces. Squadron detachments were also made to Bastia in Corsica, Araxos near Patras in Greece, Brindisi, and near Ancona. A fixed 44-gallon extra petrol tank under the port wing increased the Hurricanes&#x27; duration to almost three hours at cruising speed. The airfield on Vis (island) was extensively used as an advanced base from May 1944 to February 1945, usually to top up tanks before each armed reconnaissance.

=== Post-Second World War/Cold War ===
In July 1945, the squadron moved to Palestine where it cooperated with the police, patrolling the Kirkuk-to-Haifa oil pipeline to deter sabotage attacks. The squadron was the last RAF combat unit to operate Hurricanes, and for a brief period four Spitfires due to a lack of Hurricanes. It converted, briefly, to Hawker Tempest Mk. VIs followed, in 1946, by de Havilland Vampire FB.5s.

In January 1950, the squadron moved to RAF Habbaniya in Iraq with many moves back and forth between RAF Habbaniya and RAF Shaibah in Iraq, RAF Abu Sueir and RAF Deversoir in the Suez Canal Zone, RAF Nicosia in Cyprus, RAF Mafraq and RAF Amman in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and detachments throughout the Middle East. While visiting Amman on 15 October 1950, No. 6 Squadron was awarded a Royal Standard by King Abdullah I of Jordan in recognition of the squadron&#x27;s service in the Middle East since 1919. The squadron continued its close relationship with Jordan throughout the early 1950s, with both King Talal and King Hussein. During this period, it continued to operate Vampires FB.5s and FB.9s(1952) and two twin-seat Gloster Meteor T.7s until it re-equipped with de Havilland Venom FB.1 in February 1954 and the Venom FB.4 in June 1955.
On 6 April 1956, after a brief period back at RAF Habbaniya in Iraq the squadron returned to Cyprus and operated from RAF Akrotiri. From there it attacked Egyptian airfields during the Suez Crisis. In 1957, the squadron again re-equipped, this time with English Electric Canberras, which it continued to operate from Akrotiri until 1969.

Having been located outside of the UK for 50 years, the squadron returned in 1969 and was the first to receive the Phantom FGR.2 at RAF Coningsby the same year, before re-equipping with the Jaguar GR.1 and T.2 at RAF Lossiemouth in 1974. The squadron then moved to RAF Coltishall, being declared operational in the tactical nuclear role with twelve aircraft and eight WE.177 nuclear bombs until 1994, when the squadron&#x27;s nuclear role was terminated and the weapons withdrawn.
===Post-Cold War===

The squadron continued at RAF Coltishall in its non-nuclear role until Coltishall closed on 1 April 2006, and the squadron moved to RAF Coningsby. The squadron&#x27;s aircraft were deployed to the Gulf as part of Operation Granby (Gulf War), for which it received battle honours, and later as part of the Northern No-Fly-Zone. The squadron deployed to Italy for operations over Bosnia from 1993.

The squadron was the last to fly the SEPECAT Jaguar, and was disbanded on 31 May 2007. The Jaguar&#x27;s intended replacement in RAF service was the Eurofighter Typhoon. The RAF announced that No. 6 Squadron was to be the fourth operational front-line squadron equipped with the Typhoon and the first with Tranche 2 aircraft, initially scheduled to reform in 2008 at RAF Leuchars in Fife. However, this was delayed until 2010, with the squadron reforming at RAF Leuchars on 6 September 2010, when a closed standing-up ceremony was performed to mark the squadron&#x27;s reforming, including the arrival of the new Typhoon aircraft in 6 Squadron colours from RAF Coningsby.

The squadron has taken over the role of Quick Reaction Alert for the north of the United Kingdom from No. 111 Squadron RAF, the RAF&#x27;s last Panavia Tornado F.3 squadron, in March 2011. In November 2011 four Typhoons from No. 6 Squadron flew to RMAF Butterworth to participate in aerial war games for the 40th anniversary of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. In August 2013, several Typhoons from No. 6 were exercising with and US fighters in the Gulf. In June 2014, the squadron began to move to its new home in RAF Lossiemouth.

The squadron participated in the 2018 missile strikes against Syria during the Syrian Civil War.

In March 2020, the squadron was awarded the right to emblazon a battle honour on its squadron standard, recognising its role in Bosnia during 1995.

The squadron attended Exercise Spears of Victory 23 during February 2023 at King Abdulaziz Air Base.

<text>Hermann Schlegel (10 June 1804 – 17 January 1884) was a German ornithologist, herpetologist and ichthyologist.

==Early life and education==
Schlegel was born at Altenburg, the son of a brassfounder. His father collected butterflies, which stimulated Schlegel&#x27;s interest in natural history. The discovery, by chance, of a buzzard&#x27;s nest led him to the study of birds, and a meeting with Christian Ludwig Brehm.

Schlegel started to work for his father, but soon tired of it. He travelled to Vienna in 1824, where, at the university, he attended the lectures of Leopold Fitzinger and Johann Jacob Heckel. A letter of introduction from Brehm to Joseph Natterer gained him a position at the Naturhistorisches Museum.

==Ornithological career==
One year after his arrival, the director of this natural history museum, Carl Franz Anton Ritter von Schreibers, recommended him to Coenraad Jacob Temminck, director of the natural history museum of Leiden, who was seeking an assistant. At first Schlegel worked mainly on the reptile collection and wrote &quot;Essai sur la Physionomie des Serpens&quot; (1837), but soon his field of activity extended to other zoological groups. It had been intended that Schlegel be sent to Java to join the Natural History Commission, but the untimely death of Temminck&#x27;s intended successor, Heinrich Boie, prevented the realization of this project.

It was at this time that Schlegel met Philipp Franz von Siebold. They became firm friends and collaborated on &quot;Fauna Japonica&quot; (1845-1850).

In 1847 he became correspondent of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851 he became member.

Schlegel considered species as fixed, and consequently from the publication of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; until his death was strongly opposed to Darwin&#x27;s theory. The English naturalist Charles Darwin knew of Schlegel&#x27;s opinions on species and evolution from remarks by his close friend, the British botanist and explorer Joseph Dalton Hooker: ‘I talked much with Schlegel, he is strongly in favour of a multiple creation &amp; against migration’.

==Director of the natural history museum==
When Temminck died at the beginning of 1858, Schlegel succeeded him as director of the natural history museum, after having spent 33 years under his direction. Schlegel was particularly interested in Southeast Asia, and in 1857 sent his son Gustav to collect birds in China. Gustav arrived to find that Robert Swinhoe had gotten there first. In 1859, Schlegel sent Heinrich Agathon Bernstein to collect birds in New Guinea. After the death of Bernstein in 1865, he was succeeded by Hermann von Rosenberg.

Schlegel took on a young assistant, Otto Finsch. At the same time, he started to publish a scientific magazine, &quot;Notes from the Leyden Museum&quot;, as well as a vast work of 14 volumes, &quot;Muséum d&#x27;histoire naturelle des Pays-Bas&quot; (1862-1880). He employed three talented illustrators: John Gerrard Keulemans, Joseph Smit and Joseph Wolf.

The end of Schlegel&#x27;s life was difficult: his wife died in 1864, Finsch moved to the natural history museum at Bremen, and the collections of the British Museum started to eclipse those of Leiden.

Schlegel died on 17 January 1884 in Leiden.

His sons are the sinologist and field naturalist Gustaaf Schlegel (1840-1903) and the composer and pianist Leander Schlegel (1844-1913).

<doc id="612604" wikidata="Q1920626" url="?curid=612604" title="Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter">
<text>Thomas Cecil, 1st Earl of Exeter (5 May 1542 – 8 February 1623), known as Lord Burghley from 1598 to 1605, was an English politician, courtier and soldier.

==Family==

Thomas Cecil was the elder son of William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, by his first wife, Mary Cheke (d. February 1543), daughter of Peter Cheke of Cambridge, Esquire Bedell of the University from 1509 until his death in 1529 (and sister of Sir John Cheke). He was the half-brother of Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury, Anne Cecil, and Elizabeth Cecil.

William Cecil declared the young Thomas to be like, &quot;a spendyng sott, mete to kepe a tenniss court&quot; (a spendthrift soak, suited merely to govern a tennis court), although the same source notes that &quot;Thomas Cecil became an improved character as he advanced in life&quot;. Whilst Thomas&#x27;s career may have been overshadowed by those of his illustrious father and half-brother, he was a fine soldier and a useful politician and had a good deal of influence on the building, not only of Burghley itself, but also two other important houses: Wothorpe Towers and Wimbledon Palace.

==Career==
Cecil was educated privately and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he matriculated in 1558, being admitted to Gray&#x27;s Inn in the same year. In 1561–62 he was sent with a guardian to Europe to improve himself, at first to Paris, where he applied himself more to social pleasures than to his studies. Eventually, he was removed from this environment first to Antwerp and then to Germany, and might have proceeded to Italy but for the death of his stepbrother William, which led to his being recalled to England.

He served in government under Queen Elizabeth I of England, sitting in the House of Commons first for Stamford, Lincolnshire, in the parliaments of 1563, 1571 and 1572. He was knighted in 1575 and appointed High Sheriff of Northamptonshire for 1578. He accompanied Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester to the Dutch Republic, where he was distinguished for his bravery. In 1584 and 1586 he was Member of Parliament for Lincolnshire, and in 1585 was appointed governor of Brielle – an English Cautionary Town. He did not have good relations with Dudley, but he was very loyal to Sir John Norreys. In 1588, Cecil completed the building of Wimbledon Palace in Wimbledon Park, London, a leading example of the Elizabethan prodigy house. He returned again to the Commons as member for Northamptonshire in 1592 and 1597.

His father&#x27;s death, later in 1598, brought him a seat in the House of Lords, the 2nd Lord Burghley, as he then was, served from 1599 to 1603 as Lord Lieutenant of Yorkshire and Lord President of the Council of the North, an office based at the King&#x27;s Manor in York. It was during this period, that Queen Elizabeth I made him a Knight of the Garter in 1601.

After the death of Elizabeth in 1603, James VI and I became King of England at the Union of the Crowns. Thomas Cecil, now Lord Burghley, sent his son to Edinburgh to talk about the King&#x27;s journey to England, and soon after the courtier Roger Aston came to York to speak with him. He wrote to Sir Robert Cecil that he had moved out of King&#x27;s Manor in York, so that King James could stay there on his journey south to London. The house was empty of furnishings and &quot;quite out of order&quot;. Lord Burghley stocked the wine cellars and larders. King James came to the &quot;Manor of St Mary&#x27;s&quot; on 16 April 1603 and stayed in York for three days. Lord Burghley quarrelled with George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland over precedence and the right to carry a sword of office.

The king&#x27;s wife, Anne of Denmark, came to York in June. Lord Burghley wrote to Sir Robert Cecil that Catholic ladies from Lancashire and other counties planned to come to York to ask the new queen to help establish toleration of religion. Lord Burghley thought that &quot;she is wise enough how to answer them&quot;. After meeting Anne of Denmark, he wrote, &quot;she will prove, if I be not deceived, a magnifical prince, a kind wife and a constant mistress&quot;.

During the early reign of King James I of England, he was created Earl of Exeter on 4 May 1605, the same day his younger half-brother, Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cranborne, was created 1st Earl of Salisbury. Unlike his brother, however, he did not become a government minister under King James&#x27;s rule.

He attempted to build up a family alliance with one of King James&#x27;s leading ministers, Sir Thomas Lake, by marrying his grandson, William Cecil, 16th Baron de Ros, to Lake&#x27;s daughter, Anne Lake, in 1615, but the marriage collapsed amidst a welter of allegations and counter-allegations of adultery and incest. The ensuing scandal fascinated the Court and dragged on for years, until in 1621, the Star Chamber found that Anne, her mother, and other members of the Lake family, had fabricated all of the original allegations.

The Cecil family fostered arts; they supported musicians such as William Byrd, Orlando Gibbons, and Thomas Robinson. The latter, in his youth, was in the service of Thomas Cecil.

In 2019 Deborah Defoe proposed Thomas Cecil as a candidate in the Shakespearean authorship question in her book &quot;Behind the Arras: Thomas Cecil as Shakespeare&quot;.

== Marriages and issue ==
Thomas Cecil married, firstly, Dorothy Neville, the daughter of John Neville, 4th Baron Latimer and Lady Lucy Somerset, daughter of Henry Somerset, 2nd Earl of Worcester; and, secondly, Frances Brydges, the daughter of William Brydges, 4th Baron Chandos and Mary Hopton, and the widow of Thomas Smith, Master of Requests.

By his first wife, Thomas Cecil had ten children who survived to adulthood:
*William Cecil, 2nd Earl of Exeter.
*Lady Lucy Cecil (d. October 1614), who married William Paulet, 4th Marquess of Winchester.
*Lady Mildred Cecil (d. 23 December 1611), who married firstly, Sir Thomas Reade (d. 1595), and married secondly, Sir Edmund Trafford (c. 1560–1620).
*Sir Richard Cecil of Wakerley.
*Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon.
*Lady Mary Cecil (d. 18 March 1638), who married Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich.
*Lady Dorothy Cecil (b. August 1577 – d. 10 November 1613), who married Sir Giles Alington of Horseheath, Cambridgeshire (1572–1638). Their daughter, Mary Alington, married Sir Thomas Hatton.
*Lady Elizabeth Cecil, who married, firstly, Sir William Newport &quot;alias&quot; Hatton (1550–1597), and secondly, Sir Edward Coke of Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire.
*Thomas Cecil, esquire.
*Lady Frances Cecil (b. 28 February 1580/1581 – d. 21 June 1653), who married Nicholas Tufton, 1st Earl of Thanet.

His second wife Frances (d. 1663), the widow of Sir Thomas Smith, was around 30 when she married Cecil in 1609, he was 70. Ben Jonson alluded to their age difference in the masque &quot;The Gypsies Metamorphosed&quot;. Their daughter, Georgiana, was born in 1616. She was baptised at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Wimbledon on 13 July 1616, with Queen Anne, wife of King James I, as godmother. She died in 1621.

The Earl of Exeter died on 7 February 1623, and was buried in the chapel of St John the Baptist, Westminster Abbey, London.

<doc id="612609" wikidata="Q1050763" url="?curid=612609" title="De Havilland Dragon Rapide">
<text>The de Havilland DH.89 Dragon Rapide is a 1930s short-haul biplane airliner developed and produced by British aircraft company de Havilland. Capable of accommodating 6–8 passengers, it proved an economical and durable craft, despite its outdated plywood construction.

Developed during the early 1930s, the Dragon Rapide was essentially a smaller, twin-engined version of the four-engined DH.86 Express, and shared a number of common features, such as its tapered wings, streamlined fairings and Gipsy Six engines. First named the &quot;Dragon Six&quot;, the type was marketed as &quot;Dragon Rapide&quot; and later simply known as the &quot;Rapide&quot;. Upon its introduction in summer 1934, it proved to be a popular aircraft with airlines and private civil operators alike, attaining considerable foreign sales in addition to its domestic use.

Upon the outbreak of the World War II, many of the civil Rapides were impressed into service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy. Referred to in military service by the name de Havilland Dominie, the type was employed for radio and navigation training, passenger transport and communications missions. British training aircraft had names with educational associations, and dominie is a Scots term for a school teacher.

Hundreds of additional Dominies were also constructed during the war. Other Rapides continued to be operated by British airlines throughout the war under the auspices of the Associated Airways Joint Committee (AAJC). Postwar, many military aircraft were returned to civilian service. Shortly after the end of the Second World War, de Havilland introduced a Dragon Rapide replacement, the de Havilland Dove.

==Design and development==
===Origins===

During summer 1933, the de Havilland aircraft company commenced work upon an aircraft to meet an Australian requirement, producing a four-engined faster passenger aircraft capable of seating ten passengers, the DH.86 Dragon Express. An important feature of the DH.86 was the newly developed and powerful Gipsy Six engine, a six-cylinder variant of the four cylinder Gipsy Major engine. The DH.86 would serve as the a key starting point for the later DH.89.

During late 1933, a team at de Havilland, led by aircraft designer Arthur Ernest Hagg, began working on a new design, intended to be a faster and more comfortable successor to the earlier DH.84 Dragon. The new aircraft was, in effect, a twin-engined, scaled-down version of the four-engined DH.86 Express. It shared many common features with the earlier DH.86 Express, including its tapered wings, streamlined fairings and fuselage, as well as the same Gipsy Six engines. However, the DH.89 demonstrated none of the operational vices of the Express.

On 17 April 1934, the prototype conducted its maiden flight at Hatfield Aerodrome, Hertfordshire. Flown by senior de Havilland test pilot H.S. Broad, it was powered by a pair of Gypsy Six engines. Even prior to the prototype&#x27;s first flight, plans to proceed with serial production of DH.89 had already received the go-ahead from management. During May 1934, airworthiness trials commenced at RAF Martlesham Heath using the prototype; during one such flight, upon attaining a speed of roughly , the tip of the aircraft&#x27;s nose buckled. In response to this event, a maximum permissible speed of was implemented for all DH89s. Upon the conclusion of trials, the prototype was sold.

By November 1934, series production of the Rapide had reached full swing. Originally referred to as the &quot;Dragon Six&quot;, the aircraft was first marketed as the &quot;Dragon Rapide&quot;, although the type later came to be popularly referred to as simply the &quot;Rapide&quot;. Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, 205 aircraft were manufactured for airlines and other private owners all around the world. The Rapide is perhaps the most successful British-built short-haul commercial passenger aircraft to be produced during the 1930s.

===Further development===
In response to the issuing of Specification G.18/35 by the British Air Ministry, de Havilland decided to design and produce a single prototype of a modified Rapide for undertaking coastal reconnaissance. Trials using the prototype, &quot;K4772&quot;, were performed between April and June 1935 at RAF Martlesham Heath and RAF Gosport. However, it ultimately lost out to its rival, the Avro Anson. K4772 was later used by the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) in automatic landing trials before being broken down for spares. Work on a militarised version of the Rapide was not wasted as multiple sales were soon completed with other military customers, the first of which being to the Spanish government in December 1935.

Sensing demand for the type, de Havilland continued to modify the Rapide&#x27;s design following its entry to service, creating both refinements and entirely new derivatives as a result. Aiming to produce a faster version of the Rapide, a smaller, lighter and externally cleaner version, designated as the DH.90 Dragonfly, emerged; first flying in August 1935, the DH.90 failed to achieve a similar rate of sales to the Rapide and production was terminated in 1938 after 67 aircraft had been completed. In November 1935, the 60th airframe to be produced, &quot;G-ADWZ&quot;, was modified and used by de Havilland as a trials aircraft. Fitted with elongated rear windows, cabin heating, thickened wing tips, and a strengthened airframe to allow for an elevated gross weight of , G-ADWZ later participated in trials at Martlesham Heath, after which the higher gross weight was cleared for service.

In response to the announcement of an air race between Britain and Johannesburg, South Africa, de Havilland&#x27;s design team produced a specialised variant of the Rapid, designated as the DH.92 Dolphin. This one-off derivative featured a retractable undercarriage, an expanded wingspan of , a modified nose section, and an increased all-up weight of ; however, flight tests in August 1936 revealed there to be no performance improvement over the standard Rapide, leading to the sole Dolphin being scrapped months later.

In November 1936, in response to suggestions that the addition of flaps would aid in landing, a single Rapide was modified in order to explore their functionality. Based on this performance, in February 1937, de Havilland announced that flaps would be fitted to all production aircraft from that year onwards, while other improvements such as a downwards-facing recognition light and metal propellers could be fitted as options. From 1937, to signify the fitting of improved trailing edge flaps, aircraft thus equipped were accordingly re-designated as &quot;DH.89A&quot;; earlier-built Rapides were commonly retrofitted to this standard during their service life as well.

==Operational history==

===Prewar operations===

During July 1934, the first production Rapide, &quot;G-ACPM&quot;, performed the type&#x27;s public debut at Hatfield with its entry into the 1934 King&#x27;s Cup Race. While having achieved an average speed of 158 MPH, G-ACPM had to be withdrawn from the race during Heat 9 of Round 2 when the wing sustained damage caused by hail while flying over Waddington, Lincolnshire. Another purpose-built Rapide, &quot;ZK&#x27;-ACO&quot;, was entered into the 1934 MacRobertson Air Race; fitted with three additional fuel tanks within the fuselage to extend the aircraft&#x27;s range to 1,000 miles, the aircraft, flown by Squadron Leader J.D. Hewett and Mr C.E. Kay, took sixth place in the handicap race and fifth place in the speed race.

In the summer of 1934, the type entered service with UK-based airlines, with Hillman Airways Ltd being first to take delivery in July. 
The Anglo-Persian Oil Company was another early company to purchase the Rapide; used for quick communications purposes between individual oil fields spread out over vast distances, the aircraft quickly became popular in the oil industry, with the Iraq Petroleum Company and the Asiatic Petroleum Company also procuring their own Rapides.

From August 1934, Railway Air Services (RAS) operated a fleet of Dragon Rapides on routes linking London, the north of England and on to Northern Ireland and Scotland. The RAS DH.89s were named after places on the network, for example &quot;Star of Lancashire&quot;. Isle of Man Air Services operated a fleet of Rapides on scheduled services from Ronaldsway Airport near Castletown to airports in north-west England including Blackpool, Liverpool and Manchester. Some of its aircraft had been transferred to it after operation by Railway Air Services.

During late 1935, the first of an initial batch of 16 Rapides were shipped to the manufacturer&#x27;s Canadian branch, de Havilland Canada, for modification and re-sale purposes. Canadian aircraft received various changes, including an extended dorsal fin and a modified undercarriage arrangement, allowing for either wheels, skis, or floats to be interchangeably installed, dependent upon usage and weather conditions. The sole Canadian prototype, &quot;CF-AEO&quot;, was sold onto Quebec Airways in June 1935. Further Rapides were delivered to other customers in Canada, such as Canadian Airways, who used it on their West Coast and maritime routes.

On 30 January 1942, the majority of major Canadian operators were amalgamated into Canadian Pacific Air Lines, who continued to use the type. Further Canadian sales of the Rapide would occur both during and after the end of the Second World War.

During 1938, British operator Airwork Limited placed an initial order for nine Rapides to serve as navigation trainers. The order had been motivated by policy changes within the British Air Ministry, which sought to expand this capability. Repeat orders were placed by Airwork in the lead up to the Second World War, upon which point the firm&#x27;s fleet of Rapides were all taken on by the Royal Air Force (RAF).

Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII), owned a single Dragon Rapide (&quot;G-ADDD&quot;), which he frequently used for carrying out his royal duties. He flew this aircraft to London on his accession as king in 1936, making him the first British monarch to fly.

In July 1936 a pair of British SIS agents, Cecil Bebb and Major Hugh Pollard, flew Francisco Franco in Rapide &quot;G-ACYR&quot; from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco, at the start of the military rebellion which began the Spanish Civil War. The aircraft involved has since been placed on public display in the Museo del Aire, Madrid, Spain.

===Second World War===

At the start of Second World War on 3 September 1939, all British civil transport aircraft were requisitioned by the Ministry of Aircraft Production. A number of Dragon Rapides were used to provide internal flights under the control of National Air Communications (NAC). Perhaps one of the most significant early uses of the Rapide during the war occurred during the crucial weeks of May–June 1940, in which the Battle of France occurred; Rapides of No. 24 Squadron acted as aerial couriers between Britain and France; out of 24 aircraft, 10 Rapides were lost during this intense period of fighting.

Following the closure of the NAC network, Dragon Rapides continued to fly for British airlines during the war as part of the Associated Airways Joint Committee (AAJC). Upon the outbreak of war, all civil services had been halted; however, some routes were progressively returned to operation as and when they were deemed of value to the war effort or found to be in the national interest. The AAJC co-ordinated the majority of UK&#x27;s wartime scheduled services, which were entirely operated on over-water routes.

Other Dragon Rapides were impressed into service with the British armed forces as communications aircraft and training aircraft; Australian Rapides were also impressed by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF).

Furthermore, while the final production Rapide was completed in November 1941, de Havilland instead produced the military-orientated Dominie variant exclusively. Over 500 additional Dominies were manufactured for military use, powered by improved Gipsy Queen engines; by the end of production in July 1946, a total of 727 aircraft (both Rapides and Dominies combined) had been manufactured. During the war, Dominie production was performed by de Havilland and Brush Coachworks Ltd, the latter being responsible for the greater proportion of the work. The Dominies were mainly used by the Royal Air Force (RAF) and Royal Navy for radio and navigation training. Other duties they were used for included passenger and communications missions.

Throughout the course of the war, civilian Rapides were progressively replaced by Dominies as the type became available in greater quantities. Rapides were either dispatched to perform passenger operations or occasionally converted for other purposes, such as Air Ambulances; by the end of the conflict, only a total of nine impressed Rapides were restored to their civilian registrations; however, these were joined by many Dominies which had been deemed to be surplus to requirements.

===Postwar operations===

Postwar, the Dominie continued to be used for some time by Royal Naval air station flights as communications aircraft. By 1960, the Royal Navy still had a fleet of 14 Dominies, although under normal circumstances only three would be actively used at any one point in time, while the others were stored at RAF Lossiemouth, Moray, Scotland. The last of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Dominies had been phased out of service during 1963; thirteen aircraft were subsequently sold on via public tender, a number of which having been converted to civil Rapide configurations.

Many ex-RAF survivors had quickly entered commercial service after the end of the conflict; according to aviation author Peter W. Moss, a typical Dominie-to-Rapide conversion performed by de Havilland involved the repainting of the exterior (replacing the wartime camouflage scheme) and the installation of sound proofing, upholstered seats and a new décor within the cabin area. Additionally, various third party companies offered and performed their own conversion schemes, including Field Aircraft Services, Airwork Limited, Air Enterprises, W.A. Rollason Limited and the Lancashire Aircraft Corporation (LAC). By 1958, 81 examples were recorded as still flying on the British register.

In the Netherlands, airline KLM, keen to restart operations, set about procuring a handful of Rapides even prior to the end of the war, commencing the first of its re-launched services during September 1945. Various British airlines also became prolific users of the type; British European Airways (BEA), formed on 1 January 1946, took order 39 Rapides during February 1947. BEA used many across its fledgling network, later focusing upon services within the Scottish, Scilly, and Channel Islands while gradually selling on displaced and excess aircraft via Airwork. Small independent British airlines that chose to resist pressure from the British government to merge into BEA also commonly operated the Rapide.

In order to better distinguish between the different standards of Rapides available in the post-war environment, de Havilland established a basic mark number system. Mk 1 aircraft were those constructed pre-war, while Mk 2 and Mk 3 Rapides were ex-military conversions to a six-passenger cabin and eight-passenger cabin respectively. Those Rapides that were re-engined with a pair of de Havilland Gipsy Queen engines, were referred to as Mk 4s. These had an improved climb, cruise speed and single engine performance, but an increased all-up weight of .

By 1966, use of the Rapide had gone into decline and several formerly large operators had phased out the type completely. Due to the declining stocks of spare components available, individual Rapides were commonly being broken up in order to scavenge parts to maintain other active aircraft. Regardless, demand for such an aircraft was still relatively strong at this time, according to Moss.

The DH.89 proved an economical and durable aircraft, despite its relatively primitive plywood construction and many were still flying in the early 2000s. Several Dragon Rapides are operational in the UK, while multiple operators, including Classic Wings and Plane Heritage, offer pleasure flights in them to the general public. Shortly after the end of the Second World War, de Havilland introduced a Dragon Rapide replacement, the de Havilland Dove.

<text>Chiroxiphia is one of several genera of manakins, small song birds of South and Central America.

The male plumage is a striking combination of black and bright blue. The crown is red, except in the yellow-crowned &quot;C. pareola regina&quot;. Females are comparably dull olive-greenish overall. Juveniles of both sexes resemble the adult female. As the male plumage takes several years to complete, individuals showing a level of intermediacy between full adult male and female-like juveniles are commonly seen (in particular female-plumaged birds with red, or yellow in &quot;C. pareola regina&quot;, crowns).

Manakins of the genus &quot;Chiroxiphia&quot; have an unusual mating system, based on female mate choice. In order to mate successfully, males have to form partnerships with another male. The two males co-operate in an elaborate courtship dance, and sing a joint song (called a &quot;duet&quot;) at one of many traditionally fixed mating sites; the area where mating takes place can be described as an exploded lek. In some species such as the blue manakin, these partnerships typically consist of three males. Females attend a number of these courtship sites, observing the male displays and eventually allow a male at one of the sites to mate.

The males can typically be designated alpha and beta, since there is a clear dominance relationship between them. There is only ever one alpha male, but, depending on species, there may be one or two beta males. Beta males are sometimes sub-adults - easily recognized, as their plumage retain female-like characters. Only the alpha male is ever seen to mate with the female.

As in other manakins, males play no part in the care of the young.

Another genus, &quot;Antilophia&quot; was introduced in 1850 by the German naturalist Ludwig Reichenbach to accommodate the helmeted manakin. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;antios&quot; meaning &quot;different&quot; with &quot;lophoeis&quot; meaning &quot;crested&quot;. Until the discovery of the Araripe manakin, the helmeted manakin was the only known member of the genus &quot;Antilophia&quot;. In the taxonomic revision to create monotypic genera, all two species of &quot;Antilophia&quot; was reclassified to &quot;Chiroxiphia&quot;. They are the only two species of manakin with dichromatic (two-coloured) male plumage.
== Species==
The genus contains the following seven species:

<doc id="612625" wikidata="Q1357204" url="?curid=612625" title="Jokerit">
<text>Helsingin Jokerit (, English: Jokers or Jesters of Helsinki) is a professional ice hockey team based in Helsinki, Finland, which competes in Mestis. Jokerit plays its home games at the Helsinki Ice Hall in Helsinki.

Founded in 1967, the team has a rich history of success, having secured six league championships as a prominent member of the Finnish SM-liiga in the years 1973, 1992, 1994, 1996, 1997, and 2002. Additionally, Jokerit has three European championships to its name, having triumphed in the IIHF European Cup in 1994 and 1995, as well as the IIHF Continental Cup in 2003.

Starting in the 2014–15 season, Jokerit became part of the Bobrov Division of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) Western Conference, marking Finland as the first Nordic country to have a team competing in this international league. However, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Jokerit made the decision to withdraw from the 2022 KHL playoffs. This move was followed by the termination of several team sponsor and supplier contracts, including the home arena&#x27;s name rights holder Hartwall, as a response to the invasion. As a result, on 5 April 2022, Jokerit officially announced their decision to withdraw from the league entirely.

Jokerit intended to return to Finland and expressed their intentions to join the Liiga. However, before they could submit the formal application, Liiga announced that they would not be accepting any new applications for at least the next two seasons. Nevertheless, Jokerit remained determined to return to ice hockey in Finland.

On 31 March 2023, they submitted their application to join Mestis, the second-tier league in Finland. On 3 May, Mestis announced that they had accepted Jokerit&#x27;s application for the 2023–24 season which began on 21 September, marking the return of Jokerit to Finnish leagues after a decade.

==History==

===Establishment and early years (1967–1969)===

Jokerit, the prominent ice hockey club from Finland, owes its existence to a crucial turning point in the country&#x27;s sporting landscape.

In 1967, the ice hockey branch of Töölön Vesa, an amateur sports club grappling with significant debts, faced the difficult decision of discontinuing their resource-demanding ice hockey activities. Seizing this opportune moment, Aimo Mäkinen, a master-builder with an ardent passion for the sport, saw the potential to establish a new semi-professional sports club.

In a unique arrangement, Jokerit came into being by assuming half of Vesa&#x27;s ice hockey debts and inheriting all their assets, including junior players and a coveted position in the Suomensarja, the second highest tier of Finnish ice hockey.

On 27 October 1967, Jokerit officially took shape during a momentous constitutional meeting, with Mäkinen assuming the role of the club&#x27;s sole owner and wielding sovereign power, effectively acting as the board and managing director. The club adopted an emblem depicting a winking jester, creatively adapted from various jokers found in diverse card decks, designed meticulously by graphic artist Jorma Hinkka. The Helsinki Ice Hall became the revered home venue for the new club.

===Promotion to SM-sarja (1969–1979)===

Promotion to the highest level, SM-sarja, was achieved two years later in 1969, marking a pivotal moment in Jokerit&#x27;s history. Aiming to strengthen the team for the challenges ahead, Aimo Mäkinen, as the club&#x27;s sole owner, embarked on an assertive campaign to acquire star players. Notable additions included national team regulars, such as defenceman Ilpo Koskela, Veli-Pekka Ketola and forwards Henry Leppä and Timo Sutinen, who would go on to establish enduring connections with the club.

Subsequent to these initial reinforcements, Jokerit further bolstered its roster with noteworthy signings, including forward Jouko Öystilä and defenceman Timo Saari. Additionally, the club appointed head coach Matti Lampainen to lead the team. Notably, in 1969, the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) revised its rules, allowing bodychecking anywhere on the ice, thus prompting a tactical transformation in SM-sarja. While physical and aggressive play became a prevailing strategy for many teams, Lampainen steered Jokerit towards a different path, recognizing the unsuitability of such an approach for the current lineup, particularly of the &quot;nallipyssyketju&quot; players. Instead, he emphasized a style of play that hinged on technique and strategic finesse. This unique playing philosophy became Jokerit&#x27;s trademark, enduring until the late 1990s.
Mäkinen also prioritized the development of the club&#x27;s junior organization, introducing the Kanada-sarja competition. This initiative attracted 500 aspiring junior players initially, with the number rapidly increasing over the ensuing years. Although Kanada-sarja did not survive beyond the 1970s, its impact was felt as Jokerit benefited from a consistent influx of emerging talent, including future stars like Jari Kurri. Moreover, the club&#x27;s popularity flourished, especially in the outer urban zones of Helsinki.

Despite their on-ice achievements, notably securing Finnish championship silver in 1971 and a winning their first championship in 1973, financial profitability remained elusive during Mäkinen&#x27;s stewardship. In response, Mäkinen strategically downsized the team&#x27;s budget by prioritizing the integration of junior players to replace departing stars. As a result, Jokerit experienced a gradual decline in its success, narrowly avoiding relegation from the Finnish elite-level league on multiple occasions. These challenges, compounded by Mäkinen&#x27;s controversial management style, which emphasized non-physical play, created an aura of uncertainty and turbulence for the club&#x27;s future. Jokerit stood at a crossroads, facing critical decisions to secure its stability and enduring legacy in Finnish ice hockey.

===Success and financial troubles (1980–1990)===
In 1980, a replacement candidate emerged, leading Aimo Mäkinen to retire from his ownership role. However, he continued to contribute to the club&#x27;s junior organization until the 1990s. Subsequently, the ownership of Jokerit transitioned to new hands, overseen by Jokeriklubin Tuki Ry, a conventional association with a supervisory board.

Under the stewardship of the new management, the club faced initial challenges in shaking off its previous struggles. Nonetheless, there was a remarkable upturn for one season when Jokerit signed players who were considered outcasts from other clubs. The turning point came during the 1982–83 season when Jokerit secured the services of Nikolai Makarov, a defenseman from the Soviet Union&#x27;s national team. This significant addition led to an almost flawless season, propelling the team all the way to the SM-Liiga finals, where they faced local rivals HIFK in a best-of-five series. Jokerit won the first two match-ups and held a 2–0 lead halfway through the decisive fifth game, but HIFK came from behind to take the match and the series 3–2.

Unfortunately, the elation of the successful season was short-lived as unexpected financial problems surfaced for the management. The brief resurgence faded, and within a few years, the club found itself facing the imminent threat of bankruptcy not once but twice. This financial turmoil dealt a blow to the club&#x27;s credibility and resulted in a mass exodus of players. Key players like wing Risto Kerminen departed, and center Jari Lindroos came close to leaving the club after signing elsewhere. Though Lindroos&#x27; contract was illegitimately nullified, the team faced a challenging period. Only a few loyal players, including longtime goaltender Rauli Sohlman, remained steadfast during this trying time.

In 1986–87 season Jokerit were at the bottom of the league and were relegated.

In the darkest hour of their history, when Jokeriklubin Tuki Ry contemplated discontinuing their association with the club, a renewed sense of hope was infused into Jokerit. The year 1988 saw their 20-year-old players claim victory in the Finnish junior championship, showcasing several prospective stars. Notable among them were defenceman Waltteri Immonen, who would later serve as captain from 1991 to 1999, and Mika Strömberg, who became the club&#x27;s all-time leading scoring defenceman. Ari Sulander emerged as the main goaltender from 1993 to 1998, while forward Keijo Säilynoja displayed remarkable goal-scoring abilities and prowess in penalty shots. Most notably, the young phenomenon Teemu Selänne, who would go on to achieve records in the National Hockey League (NHL), stood among the promising talents.

In the 1988–99 season with the infusion of promising junior champions, Jokerit orchestrated a swift return to the top tier, now known as SM-liiga.

Despite the newfound popularity supported by standout scorer Selänne and other young stars, the club&#x27;s owners encountered severe financial difficulties stemming from inadequate management and internal board disagreements. These challenges posed significant hurdles as Jokerit navigated a precarious path toward securing its financial stability and future prosperity.

To fortify the club&#x27;s position, enthusiastic new owners stepped forward to rescue Jokerit. In a groundbreaking move, they established Jokeri-Hockey Oy, becoming the first limited company-based sports club in Finland. Kalervo Kummola played a prominent role in assembling the company and served on its board until 2002.

===The Harkimo ownership era begins (1991–1999)===

In 1991, Jokerit underwent a significant shift when an investor withdrew, leading to board member Harry &quot;Hjallis&quot; Harkimo assuming a double majority of shares. Harkimo took on the role of chairman of the board and implemented changes by dissolving all managerial positions, appointing his wife, Leena Harkimo, as the managing director. This marked a turning point for the club, as the internal disagreements dissipated, and Harry Harkimo&#x27;s proficient business acumen facilitated a swift recovery of the club&#x27;s financial standing. In a short span, Jokerit emerged as the wealthiest sports club in Finland.

With newfound financial strength, the club made strategic signings, securing first-class talent to reinforce the team. Key acquisitions included Otakar Janecký, who became a central figure as the first-line center and the club&#x27;s all-time leading point scorer; Petri Varis, who excelled as the club&#x27;s top goal scorer in the 1990s; and forward Antti Törmänen. Alongside the aforementioned junior champions, these players formed the core of a thriving dynasty. Jokerit celebrated Finnish championships in 1992, 1994, 1996, and 1997, as well as European Cup victories in 1995 and 1996. They also earned a Finnish silver and European bronze during this successful period.

Under Harkimo&#x27;s leadership, the club embraced a shift towards professional sports entertainment, taking inspiration from the NHL model.

In 1997, Jokerit achieved a momentous milestone by becoming the first privately owned European club to have its own home venue, Hartwall Arena. To facilitate this transformation, the ownership structure was reorganized into Jokerit HC Oyj, a public limited company. The club strategically focused on the new European Hockey League, anticipating its potential for increased revenue compared to SM-Liiga. While some expansion plans did not materialize, Hartwall Arena proved to be a lucrative venture for the club&#x27;s business.

Additionally, Harry Harkimo endeavored to create an elite team, the Newcastle Jesters, to participate in the British Ice Hockey Superleague. Though its success did not meet expectations, and the franchise was eventually sold back to the league.

With Hartwall Arena as their new home, Jokerit signed several star players to further strengthen the team. Despite boasting talented line-ups, the team&#x27;s performance experienced fluctuations, with their most notable achievement being a Finnish bronze medal in 1998. In an ironic twist, Jokerit&#x27;s long-standing rival, HIFK, claimed the SM-Liiga title in 1998, the very first year of Jokerit&#x27;s occupancy at Hartwall Arena .

===Into the next millennium (2000–2004)===
As the new millennium dawned, the management shifted their focus back to SM-Liiga, aiming to cultivate a more stable approach. However, there was a notable turnover rate in the line-ups between seasons, and a distinct core of players failed to develop or be retained.

In the 1999–2000 season, Jokerit fielded a strong team, including players like German international Jan Benda, Russian Dmitri Kvartalnov, Czech Miroslav Hlinka, long-time Jokerit alumni Petri Varis, and Finnish top players Antti-Jussi Niemi, Tom Koivisto, and Pasi Nurminen in goal. The team was further bolstered by the addition of former NHL players Tuomas Grönman and five-time Stanley Cup champion Esa Tikkanen. Despite their strength, Jokerit reached the finals but fell short, losing the series to TPS three games to one.

While the club reached the finals in 2000, they experienced repeated disappointments in the European Hockey League, which did not live up to expectations.

In the subsequent season, Jokerit faced challenges despite the presence of players like Jukka Hentunen and Antti Törmänen, who were meant to bolster the team.

The 2001–02 season saw the team welcome players like Pavel Rosa, Frank Banham, and 1995 world champion Ville Peltonen. With stellar performances by goaltender Kari Lehtonen and the acquisition of Vladimir Machulda from SaiPa, Jokerit clinched their sixth Finnish championship in 2002.

However, the following two seasons, 2002–03 and 2003–04, yielded no medals for Jokerit. In 2003, the club acquired forward Glen Metropolit from the Washington Capitals (NHL) organization, and he became a key player for Jokerit in both the regular season and playoffs, as well as the 2004–05 regular season. Another important addition was goaltender Tim Thomas, acquired from the Boston Bruins (NHL) organization. Thomas&#x27;s exceptional performance earned him the prestigious Kultainen kypärä award.

During the 2004–05 NHL lockout, Jokerit brought in Brian Campbell and welcomed Ossi Väänänen back to the team from the Colorado Avalanche. Teemu Selänne also joined the lineup, although he was unable to play due to injury. Jokerit emerged as contenders and looked poised to win the regular season and championship but faltered in the late stages, finishing as silver medalists after losing to Kärpät in the finals.

===Post-2005 NHL lockout (2005–2006)===
Following the conclusion of the NHL lockout in 2005, Jokerit faced significant player departures to both NHL teams and European clubs. Notable departures included Brian Campbell, Ossi Väänänen, Teemu Selänne, Glen Metropolit, Pasi Häkkinen, Valtteri Filppula, and Tomi Mäki. The final blow came just one day before the start of the regular season when goaltender Tim Thomas signed with the Boston Bruins.

In response to the loss of Thomas, Jokerit attempted to fill the void with goalkeeper Karl Goehring. However, Goehring&#x27;s tenure was short-lived, and he was soon replaced by ex-NHL player Steve Passmore. A mid-season pairing with HIFK&#x27;s Tom Askey also failed to adequately replace Tim Thomas. Despite efforts to strengthen the lineup with players like Eric Beaudoin and Justin Mapletoft, the team struggled to find its footing during the early season.

Adding to the challenges, Jokerit entrusted rookie coach Waltteri Immonen with his coaching debut. Immonen, a long-time Jokerit player transitioning into a head coaching role, faced a daunting task. After a discouraging start for the 2005–06 season with a record of 5–11–4 in the first 20 games, Immonen was relieved of his coaching duties in November. Curt Lindström was brought in as a replacement coach in an attempt to salvage the team&#x27;s performance. However, despite the coaching change, Jokerit faced an unprecedented outcome for the first time in 16 years as they failed to qualify for the playoffs. This marked a period of significant challenges for the club as they navigated a transitional phase in their roster and coaching staff.

===The Doug Shedden Era (2006–2008)===
Following a challenging season that resulted in Jokerit&#x27;s lowest ranking in decades, the club underwent significant changes by appointing former NHL player and head coach of HIFK, Doug Shedden, to lead the team. Shedden&#x27;s arrival brought several notable players to Jokerit, including Kim Hirschovits from HIFK, Jyrki Louhi from the 2005–06 champions HPK, and Juuso Riksman from Ässät, the second-place team in 2006. Additionally, the team acquired scoring talent Tim Stapleton and experienced NHL player Clarke Wilm, who had previously worked with Shedden during their time with the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Shedden&#x27;s inaugural season with Jokerit proved to be a success, as the team returned to the playoffs and achieved a memorable victory over the reigning champions HPK in the semi-finals. Although Jokerit ultimately fell to Kärpät in the finals, the 2006–07 season marked a promising start for Shedden&#x27;s tenure with the club.
During the 2007–08 season, Jokerit celebrated their 40th anniversary, commemorating the club&#x27;s rich history. On 27 October, the jersey of former Jokerit alumnus Jari Kurri was retired, honoring his contributions to the team. To strengthen the goaltending department, Jokerit acquired former NHL and Finnish national team goaltender Jussi Markkanen to replace Scott Langkow before the season. They also added more NHL experience by signing former Atlanta Thrashers and Vancouver Canucks center Tommi Santala after the season had commenced.

As the 2007–08 season progressed, it was announced that Doug Shedden had accepted a contract with the Swiss team EV Zug, signaling his departure from Jokerit after the season&#x27;s conclusion. Following Shedden&#x27;s announcement, it was revealed that ex-NHL head coach Glen Hanlon would succeed Shedden as the head coach of Jokerit, taking over the role after Shedden&#x27;s contract expired.

However, Shedden&#x27;s final season with Jokerit did not meet the high expectations set for the team. Despite being considered championship contenders, Jokerit faced a setback, losing a 3–1 lead in the series against the Espoo Blues and ultimately falling in the series 3 games to 4. As a result, the club was relegated to the bronze medal game, where they suffered a defeat against Tappara, concluding the 2007–08 season in fourth place. Alongside Doug Shedden&#x27;s departure, the club bid farewell to assistant coach Waltteri Immonen, who followed Shedden to EV Zug.

===Glen Hanlon&#x27;s appointment and team reinforcements (2008–2009)===

In preparation for the 2008–09 season, Glen Hanlon, former head coach of the Belarus national team and the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals, assumed the position of head coach for Jokerit, succeeding Doug Shedden. Despite coming off a recent appearance in the SM-liiga playoffs, Jokerit made notable signings to strengthen their roster for the upcoming season.

Among the new additions were former Jokerit and Dallas Stars player Juha Lind, along with former American Hockey League (AHL) players Janne Lahti and Tomi Mäki. Pasi Nielikäinen, known for his role as an enforcer, also joined the team. The defensive line was bolstered with the signing of former Jokerit and Frölunda HC defenseman Tom Koivisto, bringing an added offensive dimension to Jokerit&#x27;s defensive play. Additionally, Antti Hulkkonen was recruited for his valuable experience on the ice.

In terms of goaltending, Juuso Riksman returned to Jokerit after a one-year stint in North America and the AHL. Riksman replaced Jussi Markkanen, who moved on to join HC CSKA Moscow in the Russian Superleague (RSL).

Alongside the changes in player personnel, Jokerit&#x27;s team organization underwent some modifications after the 2007–08 season. The team&#x27;s general manager, Matti Virmanen, assumed a new role as the director of sports activities for Jokerit, leading to his replacement as the general manager by Keijo Säilynoja. Keijo Säilynoja, a former Jokerit-alumni and Finnish international player, took on the position of general manager for Jokerit on 15 June 2008.

As part of their preparations, Jokerit engaged in a preseason game against the NHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Penguins, but unfortunately, the team was defeated with a score of 4–1. This encounter marked the second time Jokerit faced an NHL team, the first being a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs during the 2003–04 season.

===2009–10 season===

In the 2009–10 season, Jokerit underwent significant coaching changes. The team initially appointed Hannu Aravirta, a former Jokerit head coach from 1993 to 1996, to lead the team. However, the season started poorly, and the team found themselves at the bottom of the standings. In an effort to improve their performance, Jokerit made key player acquisitions at the start of the season, bringing in Fredrik Bremberg, Alex Brooks, Michael Nylander, and Bates Battaglia.

On 25 November, due to the team&#x27;s struggles, Aravirta was dismissed from his coaching position, and Hannu Jortikka, who had previously coached the team in 2003–2005, was brought in as a replacement. Despite the coaching change, Jokerit&#x27;s season remained challenging, and they barely qualified for the playoffs&#x27; wild-card round. Unfortunately, their playoff run was short-lived as they were eliminated by Tappara in a 2–1 wild card series defeat.

===The Kekäläinen Era (2010–2012)===
Following the 2009–2010 season, Jokerit announced the retirement of their long-serving team CEO and sports director, Matti Virmanen. Jarmo Kekäläinen, previously a deputy CEO and player scout for the NHL&#x27;s St. Louis Blues, was appointed as the new CEO. Kekäläinen&#x27;s responsibilities included developing the team, making player and coach selections, and improving the junior development program significantly. The contract was set for five years, and Kekäläinen aimed to elevate the team&#x27;s junior operations while establishing a stable core for the roster.

The 2010–11 season began with lower-than-expected performance. Head coach Jortikka was relieved of his duties on 24 November 2010, and Erkka Westerlund, who had previously coached Jokerit from 1999 to 2001, was brought in as the new head coach. Tomi Lämsä, the coach for Lahden Pelicans&#x27; U20-juniors, replaced Sami Ranta as an assistant coach. During the season, Jokerit and HIFK played the so-called &quot;Talviklassikko,&quot; or &quot;Winter Classic&quot; an outdoor match held at Helsinki Olympic Stadium in February 2011, where HIFK won 4–3. The game drew over 36,000 spectators, setting a record for attendance in European club ice hockey. Janne Lahti topped the regular-season goal-scoring chart with 37 goals, while Teemu Pulkkinen was named Rookie of the Year after breaking the rookie single-season assist record with 36 assists. Jokerit finished the regular season in sixth place but was eliminated in the quarterfinals by HIFK with a 4–3 series defeat.
Before the start of the 2011–12 season, Jokerit qualified for the European Trophy finals after the preseason games.Jokerit lost the final to Red Bull Salzburg in December. Additionally, Jokerit played a home exhibition match against Teemu Selänne&#x27;s Anaheim Ducks in early October, losing 4–3 in overtime. The 2012 Talviklassikko was hosted by HIFK, and the game ended in a 2–2 tie after regular time, with HIFK winning the shootout. In the playoffs, Jokerit faced HIFK again, and this time, the team advanced with a 4–0 series victory. However, in the semi-finals, JYP proved stronger, defeating Jokerit with a 4–1 series result. Nonetheless, Jokerit secured a medal for the first time in years by defeating Blues 4–3 in overtime in the bronze medal game.

In December 2011, Jokerit announced that assistant coach Tomi Lämsä would take over as the head coach for the 2012–13 season on a two-year contract. Former Jokerit player Tomek Valtonen, who had coached the team&#x27;s U20-juniors, was appointed as the new assistant coach. Due to the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Jokerit welcomed Swedish defenseman Erik Karlsson, who had been named the NHL&#x27;s best defenseman, for the 2012–13 NHL season. The team also signed forward Valtteri Filppula from the NHL. Jokerit finished atop the regular-season standings, but they were eliminated in the playoffs, losing 4–2 in the quarterfinals to Rauman Lukko.

During Jarmo Kekäläinen&#x27;s tenure as CEO, the club focused on developing its junior operations, resulting in the drafting of four Jokerit players in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. In the 2012–13 season, Jokerit faced injury issues at the start, but instead of acquiring external players, the team relied on its young players. This was facilitated by Jokerit&#x27;s collaboration with Mestis team Kiekko-Vantaa, initiated during Kekäläinen&#x27;s era.

===The final SM-liiga season (2013–2014)===
On 28 June 2013, Hjallis Harkimo announced that he had sold Hartwall Areena to Finnish-Russian businessmen Gennady Timchenko and Arkady, Boris, and Roman Rotenberg, with an option to buy a share of Jokerit after the 2013–14 season. Harkimo himself was named the new CEO. At the same time, it was announced that Jokerit would transition to the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the 2014–15 KHL season, becoming the first Finnish and Nordic team to join the league.

Although the Finnish Ice Hockey Association granted Jokerit permission for the move, the SM-liiga stated that the club had not consulted the league according to IIHF regulations. Other SM-liiga teams claimed that Jokerit had violated the shareholders&#x27; agreement and demanded the team&#x27;s suspension from the 2013–14 season. Ultimately, an agreement was reached during a SM-liiga shareholders&#x27; meeting on 30 July, allowing Jokerit to compete in the following season&#x27;s SM-liiga under certain conditions. The secret terms of the agreement also allowed the club to switch to the KHL later on. Harkimo mentioned that the decision to join the KHL would likely be made in the autumn, as there was no official contract with the league at that time.

The transfer of Jokerit to the KHL for the 2014–2015 season was confirmed on 30 October. At the same time, it was announced that Arena Events had acquired 49% of Jokerit Hockey Club Oy&#x27;s shares, while Harry Harkimo retained 51% ownership. On 4 December, the club named Erkka Westerlund as their head coach for the first KHL season, signing a two-year contract.

During the 2013–14 SM-Liiga season&#x27;s Christmas break, Jokerit, sitting in seventh place in the regular-season standings, dismissed Tomi Lämsä and promoted Tomek Valtonen as the head coach. Former goaltender Pasi Nurminen also joined the coaching staff. Jokerit finished the regular season in seventh place, qualifying for the first round of the playoffs. However, they were defeated by HPK in a straight 0–2 series result.

The team&#x27;s final placement in the league was ninth. Markus Hännikäinen scored Jokerit&#x27;s last goal in the SM-liiga.

===Transition to the KHL: successes and challenges (2014–2020)===
The move to the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) marked a significant increase in Jokerit&#x27;s player budget.

During their inaugural 2014–15 KHL season, Jokerit secured the sixth position among 28 teams in the league. In the regular season, they accumulated 119 points, earning them the fourth place in the Western Conference. This was a remarkable achievement, surpassing any previous record by an expansion team in the KHL. In the playoffs, Jokerit advanced by eliminating Dinamo Minsk, becoming the first expansion team in history to reach the conference semi-finals. Unfortunately, they were eventually eliminated by CSKA Moscow in the conference finals.The team&#x27;s home games attracted a total of 327,972 spectators during the regular season, setting a new record for attendance in Finland. Additionally, American forward Steve Moses set a new KHL single-season goal-scoring record with 36 goals.

The first KHL season was widely regarded as a success within the organization and the media. Besides the team&#x27;s strong performance and significant fan interest, Jokerit made headlines due to various reasons, including a partnership deal with an international betting company, NordicBet, and the influence of the political situation in Russia. The club had faced challenges in paying salaries due to economic sanctions imposed as a result of the War in Ukraine that had started in February 2014, affecting Jokerit&#x27;s background figures Gennady Timchenko and Arkady Rotenberg.

In the 2015–16 season, Jokerit made history by becoming the first team outside Russia to win their division in the Western Conference, finishing second overall in the conference and third overall in the league, based on points earned. Despite their regular-season success, Jokerit was eliminated in the conference quarterfinals by Torpedo Nizhny Novgorod with a 2–4 series loss in the playoffs.

For the 2016–17 season, Jukka Jalonen became the new head coach. However, the team once again faced a playoff exit in the conference quarterfinals, being defeated 0–4 by the regular-season champion, CSKA Moscow.

In March 2017, Jokerit announced their commitment to continue playing in the KHL for at least the next five years.

The 2017–18 season marked the club&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebration. The team set a new club record at the beginning of the season by winning 16 consecutive games. In the playoffs, Jokerit advanced to the conference semi-finals by defeating HC Sochi 4–1 in the quarterfinals but were eliminated by CSKA Moscow in a closely contested series with a 2–4 loss. Nonetheless, the team&#x27;s fifth-place finish in the KHL and third-place finish in the Western Conference were their best achievements during their KHL era. The season also featured a historic outdoor game against SKA St. Petersburg held at Kaisaniemi Park in Helsinki on 2 December 2017. The game attracted a record attendance of 17,645 spectators, becoming the largest crowd ever in a KHL game.

In preparation for the 2018–19 season, Jokerit appointed Lauri Marjamäki as head coach on a four-year contract. The opening game of the season made Finnish sports history as Jokerit featured more foreign players than Finnish players on their roster, a significant milestone for the club. However, the team once again faced elimination in the conference quarterfinals, this time against Dynamo Moscow, losing the series 2–4.

During the 2019–20 season, Jokerit advanced to the conference semi-finals by defeating Lokomotiv Yaroslavl with a 4–2 series win in the first round of the playoffs. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Jokerit withdrew from the playoffs before facing SKA St. Petersburg in the conference semi-finals. The team had already announced that the series would be played without spectators in Helsinki due to restrictions in Finland that prevented events with more than 500 people.

In February 2020, Jokerit declared that their previous five-year agreement to play in the KHL was now an open-ended arrangement.

===End of the KHL era (2021–2022)===
The 2020–21 season was set to begin with Jokerit playing against Dinamo Minsk in Belarus, which raised widespread criticism due to the political situation in the country. Belarus had been facing significant protests following disputed presidential elections. However, the departure to Belarus was canceled at the last moment, with the team&#x27;s plane waiting on the runway.

In the 2021 playoffs, Jokerit once again confronted Lokomotiv Yaroslavl but suffered a 4–0 series defeat. All the playoff games took place in Russia due to the COVID-19 restrictions in Finland, which had forced Jokerit to play the home matches without spectators since November 2020.

Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Jokerit made an announcement on 25 February 2022, declaring their withdrawal from the 2021–22 season before the start of the playoffs. Jokerit was scheduled to face Moscow Spartak in the first round of the playoffs.

In the aftermath of the invasion, numerous sponsors severed ties with the club&#x27;s parent company. The Jokerit Supporters&#x27; Association, Eteläpääty ry, demanded the team&#x27;s withdrawal from the KHL. Additionally, the team&#x27;s Russian-owned home arena, Hartwall Arena, faced sanctions, and its marketing partner, Hartwall, terminated its contract with the arena company.

Lauri Marjamäki assumed the head coaching position at Oulun Kärpät for the remainder of the season, while several players transferred to other teams. The long-standing partnership with the Mestis team Kiekko-Vantaa also ended that spring.

On 5 April 2022, Jokerit made an announcement of the decision to completely withdraw from the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).

Over the course of its seven full KHL seasons, Jokerit advanced to the second round of the playoffs three times and the first round four times.

===Return to Finland (2022–2023)===
In April 2022, the club revealed its intention to make a comeback to the Finnish Liiga for the 2023–24 Liiga season. According to the announcement, the privately held representation team would not participate in any leagues during the 2022–2023 season, but the junior teams under the association would continue their operations as usual. Before the return would be possible, Liiga demanded Jokerit to sever all financial and ownership ties related to the previous KHL team.

Initially, the return to the Finnish leagues was being orchestrated by a new background company named Team Jokerit Oy and led by the son of Harry &quot;Hjallis&quot; Harkimo, Joel Harkimo.

However, on 1 September, Liiga stated that it would not accept any license applications from outside the league for the 2023–24 season. Heikki Hiltunen, the chairman of the Liiga board, explained that the league had not received any concrete information from Jokerit regarding the application for a Liiga license. Additionally, Harkimo&#x27;s previous involvement with the club&#x27;s KHL team posed an obstacle to the club&#x27;s return to the Liiga.

In February 2023, Joel Harkimo withdrew and pulled Team Jokerit Oy from the project. A few days later a new ownership group under Jokerit Helsinki Oy, led by Mikko Saarni and including such former Jokerit names as Ossi Väänänen, Teuvo Teräväinen and Esa Lindell, stepped in to continue with the project. On 31 March, Jokerit Helsinki Oy left the license application to Mestis. On 3 May, the Finnish Ice Hockey Association granted Jokerit a license to compete in Mestis for the 2023–2024 season.

===Return to Finnish leagues (2023–present)===
In August 2023, Jokerit played their first game since 11 January 2022, in the Pitsiturnaus tournament. Jokerit faced Porin Ässät and lost the game 4–1. One week prior to the start of the 2023–24 season, Jokerit unveiled their leadership lineup. Saku Forsblom was appointed as the new captain, with Otto Karvinen, Emil Oksanen, Erkka Seppälä, and Onni Lind assuming the roles of assistant captains. On 21 September, Jokerit played their first official league game in Finland since 16 March 2014. The game was an away game against Kiekko-Espoo and Jokerit won 3–2 in overtime with a goal from Leevi Lemberg.

On 6 October, Jokerit broke the one-game attendance record for Mestis in a game against Kiekko-Vantaa with 8,200 spectators (the previous record was 6,982). Jokerit won the game 3–2. Jokerit finished their first season in third place of the regular season but were ultimately defeated 2–4 by Kokkolan Hermes in the semi-finals.

Before the 2024–25 Mestis season, the Jokerit organization underwent several changes. Antti-Jussi Niemi announced his decision to step down as general manager. Additionally, the club welcomed back former Jokerit player Valtteri Filppula, a member of the prestigious &quot;Triple Gold Club,&quot; who joined as a player-owner. Jokerit also made significant changes to their coaching staff, appointing Risto Dufva as the new head coach to replace Tero Määttä, who continued as an assistant coach. After the start of the season Jokerit also welcomed back two of their former stars Juhamatti Aaltonen and Antti Pihlström.

==Logo and jerseys==
Jokerit originally had a logo designed by artist Jorma Hinkka, based on various joker cards. As compensation Hinkka received free tickets to Jokerit games but he never used them as he was not interested in ice hockey.

A new logo with Canadian-style speed lines was introduced in 1983 but Jokerit later reverted to the original in 1988. Notably, Nike designed a logo that was in use from 1998 to 2000. In 1997, The Hockey News ranked Jokerit&#x27;s logo as the world&#x27;s best among team insignias.

The team&#x27;s jerseys evolved over time. They began with blue and white, switched to red in 1973, and then back to blue in 1981. Different color combinations were used, including green and blue, and green and white, followed by green and purple. Eventually, the team returned to the original blue and white in 1997–98. In recent years, Jokerit shifted to yellow and black jerseys in 2019–2020, aiming to highlight the traditional logo and team colors. In 2023–2024 season all home games played in the Helsinki Ice Hall, Jokerit will play in green and purple retro jerseys and silver helmets.

==Home arena==
Jokerit had its home games at the Helsinki Ice Hall from 1967 until 1997. In 1995, Hjallis Harkimo initiated the construction of a new arena for Jokerit, which was completed in 1997. Subsequently, Jokerit began its 1997–98 SM-Liiga season at the newly built venue, known as Hartwall areena (later shortened to Hartwall Arena).

The Hartwall Arena served as the home for Jokerit from 1997 until 2022. In 2014, when Jokerit transitioned to the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), Hjallis Harkimo sold the arena to Arena Events, a company owned by Gennady Timchenko and Arkady and Boris Rotenbergs.

In March 2022, after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent sanctions imposed on Gennady Timchenko, and Arkady and Boris Rotenberg, Hartwall, the former naming rights holder, made an official announcement regarding the termination of its naming rights contracts. As a result, Hartwall Arena was renamed Helsinki Halli. Due to the impact of the imposed sanctions, beyond the loss of its original name, the arena faced financial difficulties, and any further use of the venue became impossible during this period.

In the 2023–24 Mestis season, Jokerit played their home games in two venues. Thirteen games were played at the Kerava ice rink, while for the remaining eleven games of the regular season and all playoff games, Jokerit played in the Helsinki Ice Hall.

For the 2024–25 season Jokerit returns fully to the Helsinki Ice Hall and will play all home games there.

With Helsinki Halli reopening at some point in 2025, it is possible that Jokerit may return to the arena for the first time since 2022.

==Supporters==

Jokerit boasts a fervent fanbase supported by three notable supporters organizations: the Jokerit Fan Club, Old Chiefs, and Eteläpääty.

Established in the 1970s and officially registered as an association in 1989, the Jokerit Fan Club has been a long-standing pillar of support for the club. It played a significant role in uniting fans during the successful 1990s era. After a long period of reduced activity, the Fan Club resumed its operations in 2019.

Formed in 2008, the Old Chiefs fan group is dedicated to passionate, long-time supporters who have been faithfully following the club for many years, even decades. The group serves as a gathering point for fans who may not actively participate in the livelier atmosphere of Eteläpääty.

Eteläpääty, meaning &quot;South End&quot; in English, stands as the largest and most visually impressive fan group. Established in 2008, they draw inspiration from the passionate ultras of Southern-European football and basketball leagues. Their visually appealing tifos, loud chants and unwavering dedication contribute to the vibrant atmosphere at Jokerit matches.

Jokerit supporters have extended their enthusiasm to other sports as well. In 2012, they founded the phoenix football club Jokerit FC, carrying on the legacy of FC Jokerit, and which currently competes in lower leagues. Additionally, in 2008, the fans established the floorball club Jokerit Salibandy, further showcasing their dedication and involvement in various sporting endeavors.

==Ownership==
The management and ownership of the hockey team are overseen by Jokerit Helsinki Oy. The ownership structure of the company is distributed as follows:

Class A shares are held by notable individuals within the organization, including Viima Hockey founder and owner Mikko Saarni, who serves as the chairman of the board, along with former Jokerit players Ossi Väänänen, Teuvo Teräväinen, Esa Lindell, movie producer Markus Selin, Timo Mäkelä, writer and movie director Max Seeck, and Helsingin Jokerit Ry, which is the junior organization vested with the rights to the team&#x27;s name and logo.

Class B shares are fully owned (100%) by Jokerikannattajat Oy (translated as &quot;Supporters of Jokerit&quot; in English), an entity owned by supporters of the team. Holding Class B shares entitles the supporters to a board seat within the club&#x27;s governance structure, as well as a 3% share of any player transfers to the NHL.

<text>The de Havilland Express, also known as the de Havilland D.H.86, was a four-engined passenger aircraft manufactured by the de Havilland Aircraft Company between 1934 and 1937.

==Development==

During 1933, talks between the governments of United Kingdom, India, Malaya, the Straits Settlements and Australia resulted in an agreement to establish an Empire Air Mail Service. The Australian Government called for tenders on 22 September 1933 for the Singapore-Australia legs of the route, continuing as far south as Tasmania. On the following day Qantas, anticipating success in contracting for the Singapore-Brisbane leg, placed an order with de Havilland for an as-yet non-existent aircraft to be designated the &quot;de Havilland 86&quot;, the prototype to fly by the end of January 1934. This order was soon followed by one from Holyman&#x27;s Airways of Launceston, Tasmania to operate the Bass Strait leg of the service. The D.H.86 was initially styled the &quot;Express&quot; or &quot;Express Air Liner&quot;, although the name was soon discontinued.

The D.H.86 was conceptually a four-engined enlargement of the successful de Havilland Dragon, but of more streamlined appearance with tapered wings and extensive use of metal fairings around struts and undercarriage. The most powerful engine made by de Havilland, the new 200 hp (149 kW) Gipsy Six, was selected. For long-range work the aircraft was to carry a single pilot in the streamlined nose, with a wireless operator behind. Maximum seating for ten passengers was provided in the long-range type; however, the short-range Holyman aircraft were fitted with twelve seats.

The prototype D.H.86 first flew on 14 January 1934, but the Qantas representative Lester Brain immediately rejected the single-pilot layout because he anticipated pilot fatigue over long stretches, and the fuselage was promptly redesigned with a dual-pilot nose. Only four examples of the single-pilot D.H.86 were built, and of these the prototype was rebuilt as the dual-pilot prototype. When she entered service in October 1934 the first production aircraft, Holymans&#x27; single-pilot D.H.86 &quot;Miss Hobart&quot;, was the fastest British-built passenger aircraft operating anywhere in the world. Despite de Havilland&#x27;s predictions to the contrary, the dual pilot type with its lengthened nose proved to be even faster.

Investigations in 1936 following a series of fatal crashes resulted in late production aircraft being built with additional fin area in the shape of vertical &quot;Zulu Shield&quot; extensions to the tail planes to improve lateral stability – these aircraft were designated D.H.86B.

==Operational history==

Early proving flights were flown in 1934 by Railway Air Services which had three of the first four single-pilot aircraft built. The third aircraft built, G-ACVY &quot;Mercury&quot;, started flying between Croydon Airport, Castle Bromwich, Barton, Belfast and Renfrew on 20 August 1934. The third aircraft built was shipped to Australia for Holyman&#x27;s Airways to operate the Empire air route between Melbourne and Hobart in Tasmania.

Dual-pilot D.H.86s were built for Imperial Airways and given the class name &quot;Diana&quot;. They were used on European and Empire air routes including the run from Khartoum to Lagos.

Railway Air Services (RAS) operated a fleet of seven Expresses between 1934 and 1946. RAS used the aircraft on their UK scheduled flight network including their trunk route from London Croydon via Birmingham, Manchester/Liverpool to Glasgow.

D.H.86s were also built for New Zealand&#x27;s Union Airways, flying between Auckland, Palmerston North and Wellington. During World War II, the New Zealand aircraft were fitted with bomb racks and used by the Royal New Zealand Air Force to hunt German raiders and Japanese shipping. The survivors served with New Zealand National Airways Corporation (NAC) post war.

A total of 15 D.H.86s, D.H.86As and D.H.86Bs operated commercially within Australia and New Guinea up to the outbreak of World War II. Eight D.H.86A and D.H.86B aircraft were impressed into the Royal Australian Air Force and served as A31-1 to A31-8 during the War. Some served as air ambulances in the Middle East, while others did sterling work as transport aircraft and air ambulances in Australia and New Guinea.

A total of 62 D.H.86s of all types were built. Most of those still flying in Europe at the start of World War II, except for the Railway Air Services aircraft, were taken into military service, mostly for communications and radio navigational training. A few Expresses survived the war and were used by UK air charter operators until the last example was burnt out in 1958.

==Technical deficiencies==

Seriously lacking in directional stability, the D.H.86s were frequently in trouble. On 19 October 1934 Holyman&#x27;s VH-URN &quot;Miss Hobart&quot; was lost in the Bass Strait with no survivors. Flotsam that may have been wreckage from the aircraft was seen from the air three days later but surface ships failed to locate it in rough seas; the aircraft had effectively vanished. At the time &quot;Miss Hobart&quot; disappeared it was thought that an accident may have occurred when Captain Jenkins and the wireless operator/assistant pilot Victor Holyman (one of the proprietors of Holyman Airways) were swapping seats midflight. However, following the loss of Qantas&#x27; VH-USG near Longreach four weeks later while on its delivery flight, it was found that the fin bias mechanisms of the crashed aircraft and at least one other were faulty, although it is doubtful that this had any direct bearing on the accidents other than perhaps adding to the aircraft&#x27;s lack of inherent stability. Further investigation revealed that VH-USG had been loaded with a spare engine in the rear of the cabin, and that one of the crew members was in the lavatory in the extreme aft of the cabin when control was lost. It was theorised that the centre of gravity was so far aft that it resulted in loss of control at an altitude too low for the pilot to recover (the aircraft was at an estimated height of prior to the crash).

On 2 October 1935 Holyman&#x27;s VH-URT &quot;Loina&quot; was also lost in Bass Strait, again with no survivors. This time a significant amount of wreckage was recovered from the sea and from beaches on Flinders Island. Investigation of the wreckage revealed a section of charred carpet on a piece of cabin flooring from just ahead of the lavatory door. It was thought possible that a small fire from a dropped cigarette had led to someone running aft suddenly to stamp it out – a sudden change in weight distribution that could lead to fatal loss of directional control while the aircraft was on a low-speed landing approach.

On 13 December 1935, another Holyman DH86, &quot;Lepina&quot;, forced-landed on Hunter Island off northern Tasmania with the lower port interplane strut having &quot;vibrated loose&quot;. An investigation by the Australian Civil Aviation Board using stop-motion film of the wing in flight resulted in identification of wing distortion and failure under certain flight conditions. Australian authorities in December 1935 required the installation on all Australian DH86 aircraft of a complete set of lift bracing in the wing rear spar and redesign of the bracing on the tail unit to provide greater redundancy.

The Royal Air Force&#x27;s Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment tested the D.H.86A design in 1936 following three fatal crashes in Europe. It would be forty years before the report was published. The D.H.86 had been rushed from design concept to test flight in a record four months to meet the deadlines set by the Australian airmail contracts, and a lot of attention to detail had been ignored. It was a big aircraft for its power, and as a result very lightly built. There was poor response to control movements in certain speed ranges, the wings were inclined to twist badly if the ailerons were used coarsely and, most seriously, the vertical tail surface was of inadequate area. The result was an aircraft that, although quite safe under normal conditions, could rapidly get out of control under certain flight regimes.
Although the control problems were overcome on later-manufactured D.H.86Bs by the fitting of a new spring in the elevator control and the fitting of auxiliary fins, the results of these tests do not appear to have been communicated to Australia and the D.H.86s already in use were never modified in this way to improve their safety. This lack of communication may have caused a number of later accidents, including at least one of two further fatal disasters in commercial service. The mid-air break-up of Qantas&#x27; VH-USE &quot;Sydney&quot; in a thunderstorm near Brisbane on 20 February 1942 with the loss of nine lives, was possibly unavoidable; however, the fin was found almost a mile away from the main wreckage which had been burnt. The accident involving MacRobertson Miller Airlines’ ex-Qantas aircraft VH-USF at Geraldton on 24 June 1945 most likely was entirely avoidable had the AaAEE report been communicated to Australia. On its first commercial flight for its new owners after military service, the pilot and a passenger were killed in a classic loss-of-control accident while taking off with a heavy load in gusty conditions.

Another D.H.86, VH-USW (the former Holyman&#x27;s Airways &quot;Lepena&quot;), was bought by MacRobertson Miller Airlines at much the same time as VH-USF and was the last of the type to fly in Australia. MMA sold the eleven-year-old aircraft to an English company late in 1946; it was abandoned in India in an &quot;unsafe state&quot; while on its delivery flight. Edgar Johnston, the Assistant Director General of the Australian Department of Civil Aviation, then had it scrapped at Australian Government expense to make sure that it never flew again.

==Political and commercial consequences==
Following the first three fatal Australian D.H.86 accidents, and a forced landing by VH-USW &quot;Lepena&quot; on 13 December 1935 when the pilot believed his aircraft was about to break up in mid-air, the Australian Government temporarily suspended the type&#x27;s Certificate of Airworthiness. This caused outrage in Britain as it reflected on the whole British aircraft industry. The D.H.86 had approached the limits to which traditional &quot;plywood and canvas&quot; aircraft construction could be taken, and was obsolete compared to all-aluminium stressed-skin aircraft like the Boeing 247 and the Douglas DC-1 that were already flying before it was even designed, and the Douglas DC-3 that had its first flight just four days after the forced-landing of VH-USW. Under pressure from Holymans and other companies, in 1936 the Australian Government rescinded its ban on the import of American aircraft, and from then on, with the exception of the Vickers Viscount and British Aerospace 146, large airliners used in Australia were of American or Dutch manufacture.

==Other accidents and incidents==

<doc id="612637" wikidata="Q6006885" url="?curid=612637" title="Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing">
<text>The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) is an international dance teaching and examination board based in London, England. The registered educational charity, which was established on 25 July 1904 as the &quot;Imperial Society of Dance Teachers&quot;, provides training and examinations in a range of dance styles and certified dance teacher courses. The ISTD is recognised by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Council for Dance Education and Training and is also a member of the British Dance Council. It hosts various competitions in many different formats including Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Classical Ballet and Tap Dance as well as contemporary styles like Disco Freestyle.

The ISTD is organised into two main faculty boards. Dancesport coordinates dance techniques that are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall. Theatre is concerned with stage and film performance. The Cecchetti Society is also part of the ISTD. It exists to preserve the Cecchetti method of classical ballet training. The ISTD is also represented on the committees of numerous other arts, dance and culture related organisations.

== History ==
The Imperial Society of Dance Teachers was formed on 25 July 1904 at the Hotel Cecil in Covent Garden, London. Robert Morris Crompton was its first President. The first ISTD congress was held in 1906 and a congress has subsequently been held every year, with the exception of a brief period during the war years. Its in-house publication &quot;Dance Journal&quot; (now titled &quot;DANCE&quot;) was first published in September 1907.

In 1924 the separate branches, which later became faculties, were formed, and in 1925 the society became the &quot;Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance&quot;. In 1945, the ISTD became incorporated with Victor Silvester in the new role of chairman.

In 1953 the Grand Council of the ISTD was formed. Notable persons from many areas of British society joined the council. It serves to improve communication with key people in British arts and society.

The ISTD is most noted for the use of medal tests, and the ISTD format has been used as a model for similar award systems by many other dance organisations. The idea of medal tests first came from another dance teaching organisation, but it was the ISTD, which first developed the widespread use of the medal test system throughout the UK and internationally.

==Current structure==
The ISTD is a government recognised dance teaching organisation and examination board, which trains and certifies teachers to deliver its syllabus to students in both private and mainstream dance education. The ISTD offers syllabi in a range of dance styles, which are typically delivered in the form of medal tests or graded examinations. An accredited awarding body, the ISTD offers qualifications that can be submitted for credit on the National Qualifications Framework. The organisation structure of the ISTD is divided into three levels, the Administrative Council, Faculty Boards and Faculty Committees.

===Board of Trustees (The council)===
The board of trustees is responsible for the overall governance of the ISTD and consists of executives and elected members, headed by ISTD Chair, Michael Elliott. The board of trustees is the principal policy making body of the organisation and rules on recommendations made by the faculty boards and committees, which are represented on the Board. Key administrative duties are performed by executive members, the Finance, Audit &amp; General Purposes Committee and the Nomination &amp; Remuneration Committee. The Board of Trustees also includes the Grand Council, a group of eminent dance professionals.

===Faculty Boards===
The work of the ISTD is divided into two main branches; the Dancesport Faculties Board and the Theatre Faculties Board. These two faculty boards coordinate the work of the faculty committees, which are grouped to reflect the similarities between them. For example, the Dancesport board consists of dance techniques which are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall setting, both socially and competitively, whereas the Theatre board, as the name suggests, consists of dance techniques which usually have a connection to stage or film.

===Faculty committees===
The ISTD consists of twelve faculty committees, which are divided between the two Faculty Boards. Each faculty committee is responsible for the technical and artistic development of a specific dance technique within the ISTD. The work of a faculty committee includes the continued development of the syllabi for the relevant dance technique, the regulation and control of examinations and the organisation of lectures, teacher training courses, seminars and other events.

== Examinations ==
The ISTD is primarily a dance examination board, with teacher members delivering its syllabi to students in both private and mainstream education. The majority of people who study the ISTD syllabus are people pursuing dance as a leisure activity and the organisation provides a structured examinations system that caters for pupils from beginner to professional level. At the higher levels, ISTD teachers can provide training for people wishing to pursue dance as a profession, either as a performer or dance teacher. Typically, most subjects have a series of graded examinations. These progress from Pre-Primary &amp; Primary and up through numbers Grades (Grade 1, Grade 2, etc.), with Vocational graded examinations at Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2 levels. Some subjects have differing examination systems, some offering medal tests and other awards.

=== Grade exams ===
The grade system is especially adapted to different ages of pupils, and as a basis for dance as an activity in schools or other similar institutions. Grade Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Modern Theatre, Tap, National Dance, Classical Greek, Classical Indian, Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Disco Freestyle, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll, Contemporary Dance, Sequence and Street Dance. Grades 1-6 are accredited by Ofqual, but some Faculties have additional Grades prior to Grade 1, that is, Pre-Primary and Primary.

=== Class exams ===
Class Examinations may be taken in Classical Ballet (Cecchetti and Imperial methods), Classical Greek, Tap and Modern Theatre.

=== Medal tests ===
Medal tests may be taken in Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Sequence, Disco Freestyle, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll, Country &amp; Western, Classical Greek, Tap, Modern Theatre and National. The levels progress from Under 6, Under 8, Social Dance Test, Pre-Bronze Dance Test, to Bronze, Silver, Gold, Gold Star and higher awards for Dancesport medals.

=== Vocational grades ===
The Vocational Grades are accredited by Ofqual and include Intermediate Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced 1 and Advanced 2. These examinations form a cohesive bridge between the work covered in the Grades and the work of the professional examinations.

=== Professional qualifications ===
Dancers who have achieved a high level examination pass in an ISTD dance subject can progress into teacher training with the organisation. The teacher training is provided through approved dance centres and consists of both theory and practical examinations designed to demonstrate the candidates ability and knowledge to teach dance. People who successfully complete the training become registered teachers of the ISTD and may enter students for examinations in the dance subject for which they have qualified. Some ISTD teacher may progress to further their qualifications further and gain qualifications in other branches of the society. There are various professional examinations, depending on where candidates live.

*European Union Theatre Examinations: Teachers entering candidates for ISTD examinations need to gain the &quot;Diploma in Dance Instruction&quot;, followed by the &quot;Diploma in Dance Education&quot; and then may choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.
*Rest of the World Theatre Examinations: For the rest of the world the qualifications are the &quot;Associate&quot; and the &quot;Associate Diploma&quot;. Teachers can enter students for examinations following their Associate examination and once they have obtained their &quot;Associate Diploma&quot; can then choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.
*Global Dancesport Examinations: For all Dancesport examinations, regardless of country, the &quot;Student Teacher&quot; and &quot;Associate&quot; qualifications can be taken. Candidates within the European Union can also take &quot;Foundation in Dance Instruction&quot; and &quot;Certificate in Dance Education&quot; in some dance genres if they wish. Following Associate, candidates may choose to progress to Licentiate and Fellowship.

==Notable people==

<doc id="612642" wikidata="Q7735458" url="?curid=612642" title="The Funeral (1984 film)">
<text>is a 1984 Japanese comedy film written and directed by Juzo Itami.

The film shows the preparations for a traditional Japanese funeral. It mixes grief at the loss of a husband and father with wry observations of the various characters as they interact during the three days of preparation.

&quot;The Funeral&quot; was Itami&#x27;s feature film debut and was an enormous success in Japan. It won five Japanese Academy Awards in 1985 including Best Film, Best Director, and Best Actor for Tsutomu Yamazaki. It was nominated in a further five categories and also came first in the annual &quot;Kinema Junpo&quot; critics&#x27; poll. In May 2022, the Criterion Collection released a restoration of the film on Blu-ray.

Itami took inspiration for the film from his experience with the funeral of his father-in-law (Nobuko Miyamoto&#x27;s father).

In 1992, it was screened on the United Kingdom&#x27;s Channel 4 under the title &quot;Death, Japanese Style&quot;.

==Plot==
Shinkichi Amamiya (Hideji Otaki) is a difficult 69-year-old man, married to Kikue (Kin Sugai). He dies suddenly of a heart attack, and it falls to his daughter Chizuko (Nobuko Miyamoto) and son-in-law Wabisuke Inoue (Tsutomu Yamazaki) to organize the funeral at their house.

Among other things, the family have to choose a coffin, hire a priest, hold a wake, learn formal funeral etiquette and hold the service itself.

During the three days of preparation, various tensions within the family are hinted at, such as resentment of a rich but stingy uncle, Inoue&#x27;s affair with a younger woman, and possibly an affair the dead man himself had with a female gateball player.

After the service, the long-suffering wife delivers a dignified speech to the family regretting that the hospital would not let her be with her husband as he died.

<doc id="612645" wikidata="Q469352" url="?curid=612645" title="Louis Michel">
<text>Louis Michel (; born 2 September 1947) is a Belgian politician. He served in the government of Belgium as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2004 and was European Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid from 2004 to 2009. From 2009 to 2019, he was a Member of the European Parliament. Michel is a prominent member of the French-speaking liberal party, the &quot;Mouvement Réformateur&quot;. He is the father of Charles Michel, the previous Prime Minister of Belgium and previous President of the European Council.

==Family roots==
The Michel family comes from the Flemish town Hoegaarden, just across the 1963 official linguistic border and the frontier between the present (since 1994) provinces of Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant. There, it has been nicknamed from the XIXth century onward as the ‘Sellekes’. Louis Michel &quot;went to school in Hoegaarden and still speaks perfectly the local dialect&quot;. His family moved from Hoegaarden to Zétrud-Lumay in 1955.

==Early professional career==
From 1968 to 1978, before dedicating his life to his political career, Michel taught English, Dutch and German in the Provincial School of Jodoigne, a rural town 25 miles from Brussels.

==Political career==
From 1967 to 1977, Michel was chairman of the &quot;Young Liberals&quot; in the district of Nivelles. Then he became alderman in Jodoigne from 1977 to 1983, &quot;secretary-general&quot; of the Parti Réformateur Libéral (PRL) political party from 1980 to 1982 and chairman of the PRL from 1982 to 1990 and from 1995 to 1999.

He was a member of the Belgian federal parliament as a representative (1978–1999).

===Minister of Foreign Affairs, 1999–2004===
Michel was the Belgian foreign minister and Vice Prime Minister from 1999 to 2004. During his time in office, he pursued former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet for crimes against humanity and played an active role in trying to bring peace to the war-weary Great Lakes region of central Africa.

In July 2004, the Verhofstadt government appointed Michel as its candidate for the Belgian seat on the European Commission led by José Manuel Durão Barroso, to replace former commissioner Philippe Busquin. He was nominated on 12 August 2004 to become EU commissioner starting in November 2004.

As part of a political agreement, Busquin resigned early in September 2004 to give Louis Michel an early opportunity to serve on the European Commission. Michel completed Busquin&#x27;s term as the European Commissioner for Science and Research and then served as the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Development.

He is also the mayor of the municipality of Jodoigne in Walloon Brabant and has been since 1983.

In 2006, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed him to a High-level Panel on United Nations Systemwide Coherence, which was set up to explore how the United Nations system could work more coherently and effectively across the world in the areas of development, humanitarian assistance and the environment.

Michel withdrew himself from the Commission between the 12 May and the 10 June 2007 to take care of his political party because of the elections of 10 June 2007. He resigned as Commissioner in July 2009 to become a Member of the European Parliament.

===Member of the European Parliament, 2009–2019===
Throughout his time as Member of the European Parliament, Michel served on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. From 2016 until 2017, he was part of the Committee of Inquiry into Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion (PANA) that investigated the Panama Papers revelations and tax avoidance schemes more broadly.

In addition to his committee assignments, Michel co-presided over the ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly which advises on the orientations of co-operation policies between the EU and its partners in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. He was also a member of the European Parliament Intergroup on LGBT Rights; the European Parliament Intergroup on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights; and the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. He supported the MEP Heart Group, a group of parliamentarians who have an interest in promoting measures that will help reduce the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD).

Michel is also a member of the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee, ever since the foundation was launched in 2008 by former French president Jacques Chirac to promote world peace.

==Political issues==
===The Democratic Republic of the Congo dossier===

Michel has been interested in the Central Africa situation and busy with the Democratic Republic of the Congo dossier since he became Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs (1999–2004) and European Commissioner in charge of the Development &amp; Humanitarian Aid in the Barroso Commission.

Congo was a Belgian colony between 1908 and 1960. Since then, the relations between Brussels and Kinshasa have been tumultuous. They have included such events as the secession of Katanga backed by Belgium, the murder of the Prime Minister Lumumba by the Belgian secret services, the expulsion of the Belgian ambassador in the 1960s, the banning of the Sabena company from landing in Kinshasa, and &quot;authentic Zaïrian&quot; policy. The father of Joseph Kabila, Laurent-Désiré Kabila had very bad relations with Brussels. Many rumours accuse Louis Michel of having used Joseph Kabila as a puppet since his father was murdered in 2001. Therefore, the media has described in a very suspicious way the good relations between Louis Michel and Joseph Kabila.

Since 2001, Michel has encouraged the peace process for the Democratic Republic of the Congo that officially put an end to the Second Congo War by establishing a Transitional government (June 2003 – June 2006). The two main missions of this government were to maintain the peace by integrating all the militias into the unified army and to bring the country to elections on 30 June 2006 having ratified the new constitution by referendum.

In a lecture on 17 January 2008 (entitled Africa-Europe: the indispensable partnership) at the London School of Economics, Michel faced Congolese protestors who accused him of being complicit in Kabila&#x27;s assassination and installing a puppet government in the Congo. The meeting was abandoned shortly before its scheduled end as the chair found it impossible to continue with the interruptions.

In a 2010 magazine interview Michel stated, &quot;Leopold II was a true visionary for his time, a hero.&quot; The comment was negatively received in the Congo.

===Lebanon===
After the Israeli-Lebanese conflict in 2006 the Commissioner visited Lebanon and called for €30 million to repair the damage there. The Parliament&#x27;s development committee was cautious though about the expenditure and he was also criticised for his slow response with one MEP comparing him to &quot;a fireman who arrives at the scene after the fire has gone out&quot;. In the same debate MEPs attacked the Commissioner for &quot;appearing partial in the Congolese elections&quot; in describing Joseph Kabila as &quot;the hope of Congo&quot;. Michel responded by saying he would have said the same about any candidate in the democratic elections.

==Controversy==
Michel caused some mild controversy in 2007 among MEPs when it became known that he is to take leave from his work to compete in Belgian elections. Generally Commissioners are meant to remain above national politics and the European Parliament&#x27;s development committee asked the Parliament&#x27;s legal service to assess if his participation violates the treaties. During his absence (12 May 2007 onwards), Commissioner Rehn took over his duties.

In 2010, Michel called King Leopold II of Belgium, the Congo Free State&#x27;s colonial master responsible for the deaths of between 3 million and 10 million Congolese Africans, a &quot;visionary hero.&quot; Guy Verhofstadt, then leader of the Liberals in the European Parliament, refused to comment on Michel&#x27;s controversial remarks.

In November 2010, Michel led a delegation of 50 MEPs on an eight-day trip to an ACP–EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly meeting in Kinshasa, whose total cost to the Parliament&#x27;s administrative budget was €1.03 million, an average cost per MEP of €20,511. It was the costliest parliamentary delegation trip outside the EU in 2010.

In 2013, Michel was accused of submitting 229 amendments to an EU data protection bill of which 158 were strongly anti-privacy. First he denied, then he argued his assistant did it. The assistant resigned. In 2020 Michel&#x27;s son Mathieu Michel became Belgian State Secretary for Digitization, in charge of Administrative Simplification, Privacy and the Buildings Administration.

<doc id="612650" wikidata="Q28918" url="?curid=612650" title="Luce Irigaray">
<text>Luce Irigaray (; born 3 May 1930) is a Belgian-born French feminist, philosopher, linguist, psycholinguist, psychoanalyst, and cultural theorist who examines the uses and misuses of language in relation to women.

Irigaray&#x27;s first and most well known book, published in 1974, was &quot;Speculum of the Other Woman&quot; (1974), which analyzes the texts of Freud, Hegel, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant through the lens of phallocentrism. Irigaray is the author of works analyzing many thinkers, including &quot;This Sex Which Is Not One&quot; (1977), which discusses Lacan&#x27;s work as well as political economy; &quot;Elemental Passions&quot; (1982) can be read as a response to Merleau‐Ponty&#x27;s article “The Intertwining—The Chiasm” in &quot;The Visible and the Invisible&quot;, and in &quot;The Forgetting of Air in Martin Heidegger&quot; (1999), Irigaray critiques Heidegger&#x27;s emphasis on the element of earth as the ground of life and speech and his &quot;oblivion&quot; or forgetting of air.

Irigaray employs three different modes in her investigations into the nature of gender, language, and identity: the analytic, the essayistic, and the lyrical poetic. As of October 2021, she is active in the Women&#x27;s Movements in both France and Italy.

==Education==
Luce Irigaray received a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Louvain in 1954, a master&#x27;s degree from the same university in 1956, and taught at a high school in Brussels from 1956 to 1959.

In 1960, she moved to Paris to pursue a master&#x27;s degree in Psychology from the University of Paris, which she earned in 1961. She also received a specialist diploma in Psychopathology from the school in 1962. In 1968, she received a doctorate in Linguistics from Paris X Nanterre. Her thesis was titled .

She completed a PhD in linguistics in 1968 from the University of Vincennes in Saint-Denis (University of Paris VIII). Her dissertation on speech patterns of subjects suffering from dementia became her first book, , published in 1973. In 1974, she earned a second PhD in Philosophy.

In the 1960s, Irigaray started attending the psychoanalytic seminars of Jacques Lacan and joined the École Freudienne de Paris (Freudian School of Paris), directed by Lacan. She was expelled from this school in 1974, after the publication of her second doctoral thesis (doctorat d&#x27;État), &quot;Speculum of the Other Woman&quot; (, later retitled as ), which received much criticism from both the Lacanian and Freudian schools of psychoanalysis. This criticism brought her recognition, but she was removed from her position as an instructor at the University of Vincennes as well as ostracized from the Lacanian community.

She held a research post at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique since 1964, where she is now a Director of Research in Philosophy. Her initial research focused on dementia patients, about whom she produced a study of the differences between the language of male and female patients.

It has also been noted that in her writings, Irigaray has stated a concern that an interest in her biography would affect the interpretation of her ideas, as the entrance of women into intellectual discussions has often also included the challenging of women&#x27;s point of view based on biographical material. Her most extensive autobiographical statements thus far are gathered in &quot;Through Vegetal Being&quot; (co-authored with Michael Marder). Overall, she maintains the belief that biographical details pertaining to her personal life hold the possibility to be used against her within the male dominated educational establishment as a tool to discredit her work. However, at age 91, she published &quot;A New Culture of Energy: Beyond East and West&quot; (2021) in which she discusses her decades-long practices of yoga asanas (postures) and pranayama (breathing) and maintains that yoga builds a bridge between body and spirit.

==Major works==

=== &quot;Speculum of the Other Woman (Speculum de l&#x27;autre femme)&quot; ===
Her first major book, &quot;Speculum of the Other Woman,&quot; based on her second dissertation, was published in 1974. In &quot;Speculum,&quot; Irigaray engages in close analyses of phallocentrism in Western philosophy and psychoanalytic theory, analyzing texts by Freud, Hegel, Plato, Aristotle, Descartes, and Kant. The book&#x27;s most cited essay, &quot;The Blind Spot of an Old Dream,&quot; critiques Freud&#x27;s lecture on femininity.

=== &quot;This Sex Which is Not One&quot; (&quot;Ce sexe qui n&#x27;en est pas un&quot;) ===
In 1977, Irigaray published &quot;This Sex Which is Not One&quot; () which was subsequently translated into English with that title and published in 1985, along with &quot;Speculum&quot;. In addition to more commentary on psychoanalysis, including discussions of Lacan&#x27;s work, &quot;This Sex Which is Not One&quot; also comments on political economy, drawing on structuralist writers such as Lévi-Strauss. For example, Irigaray argues that the phallic economy places women alongside signs and currency, since all forms of exchange are conducted exclusively between men.

==== &quot;Women on the Market&quot; (Chapter Eight of &quot;This Sex Which is Not One)&quot; ====
Irigaray draws upon Karl Marx’s theory of capital and commodities to claim that women are exchanged between men in the same way as any other commodity is. She argues that our entire society is predicated on this exchange of women. Her exchange value is determined by society, while her use value is her natural qualities. Thus, a woman’s self is divided between her use and exchange values, and she is only desired for the exchange value. This system creates three types of women: the mother, who is all use value; the virgin, who is all exchange value; and the prostitute, who embodies both use and exchange value.

She further uses additional Marxist foundations to argue that women are in demand due to their perceived shortage and as a result, males seek &quot;to have them all,&quot; or seek a surplus like the excess of commodity buying power, capital, that capitalists seek constantly. Irigaray speculates thus that perhaps, &quot;the way women are used matters less than their number.&quot; In this further analogy of women &quot;on the market,&quot; understood through Marxist terms, Irigaray points out that women, like commodities, are moved between men based on their exchange value rather than just their use value, and the desire will always be surplus – making women almost seem like capital, in this case, to be accumulated. &quot;As commodities, women are thus two things at once: utilitarian objects and bearers of value.&quot;

=== &quot;Elemental Passions&quot; ===
Luce Irigaray&#x27;s &quot;Elemental Passions&quot; (1982) could be read as a response to Merleau‐Ponty&#x27;s article “The Intertwining—The Chiasm” in &quot;The Visible and the Invisible&quot;. Like Merleau‐Ponty, Irigaray describes corporeal intertwining or vision and touch. Counteracting the narcissistic strain in Merleau‐Ponty&#x27;s chiasm, she assumes that sexual difference must precede the intertwining. The subject is marked by the alterity or the “more than one” and encoded as a historically contingent gendered conflict.

==Themes==

=== Philosophy ===
Some of Irigaray&#x27;s books written in her lyrical mode are imaginary dialogues with significant contributors to Western philosophy, such as Nietzsche and Heidegger. However, Irigaray also writes a significant body of work on Hegel, Descartes, Plato, Aristotle and Levinas, Spinoza, as well as Merleau-Ponty. Her academic work is largely influenced by a wide range of philosophers and cannot be limited to one approach.

=== Language ===
She continued to conduct empirical studies about language in a variety of settings, researching the differences between the way men and women speak. This focus on sexual difference is the key characteristic of Irigaray&#x27;s oeuvre, since she is seeking to provide a site from which a feminine language can eventuate. Through her research, Irigaray discovered a correlation between the suppression of female thought in the Western world and language of men and women. She concluded that there are gendered language patterns that denote dominance in men and subjectivity in women.

=== Gender identity ===
Since 1990, Irigaray&#x27;s work has turned increasingly toward women and men together. In &quot;Between East and West, From Singularity to Community&quot; (1999) and in &quot;The Way of Love&quot; (2002), she imagines new forms of love for a global democratic community. In &quot;An Ethics of Sexual Difference&quot;, she introduces the idea of relationships between men and women centered around a bond other than reproduction. She acknowledges themes including finiteness and intersubjectivity, embodied divinity, and the emotional distinction between the two sexes. She concludes that Western culture is unethical due to gender discrimination.

=== Politics ===
Irigaray is active in a feminist movement in Italy, but she refused to belong to any one movement because she does not like the competitive dynamic between the feminist movements.

==Criticism==
Some feminists criticize Irigaray&#x27;s perceived essentialist positions. However, there is much debate among scholars as to whether or not Irigaray&#x27;s theory of sexual difference is, indeed, an essentialist one. The perception that her work is essentialist concentrates on her attention to sexual difference, taking this to constitute a rehearsal of heteronormative sexuality. As Helen Fielding states, the uneasiness among feminists about Irigaray&#x27;s discussion of masculinity and femininity does not so much reveal Irigaray&#x27;s heteronormative bias as much as it &quot;arises out of an inherited cultural understanding [on the part of her critics] that posits nature as either unchanging organism or as matter that can be ordered, manipulated and inscribed upon. Hence the concern over essentialism is itself grounded in the binary thinking that preserves a hierarchy of...culture over nature.&quot;

W. A. Borody has criticised Irigaray&#x27;s phallogocentric argument as misrepresenting the history of philosophies of &quot;indeterminateness&quot; in the West. Irigaray&#x27;s &quot;black and white&quot; claims that the masculine equates to determinateness and that the feminine equates to indeterminateness which contain a degree of cultural and historical validity, but not when they are deployed to self-replicate a similar form of the gender-othering they originally sought to overcome.

In &quot;Fashionable Nonsense&quot;, Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont criticized Irigaray&#x27;s use of hard-science terminology in her writings. Among the criticisms, they question the purported interest Einstein had in &quot;accelerations without electromagnetic reequilibrations&quot;; confusing special relativity and general relativity; and her claim that is a &quot;sexed equation&quot; because &quot;it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us&quot;. In reviewing Sokal and Bricmont&#x27;s book, Richard Dawkins wrote that Irigaray&#x27;s assertion that fluid mechanics was unfairly neglected in physics due to its association with &quot;feminine&quot; fluids (in contrast to &quot;masculine&quot; solids) was &quot;daffy absurdity&quot;.

<doc id="612652" wikidata="Q931481" url="?curid=612652" title="Johnny B. Goode">
<text>&quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is a song by American musician Chuck Berry, written and sung by Berry in 1958. Released as a single in 1958, it peaked at number two on the Hot R&amp;B Sides chart and number eight on its pre-&quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song remains a staple of rock n&#x27; roll music.

&quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; is considered one of the most recognizable songs in the history of popular music. Credited as &quot;the first rock &amp; roll hit about rock &amp; roll stardom&quot;, it has been covered by various other artists and has received several honors and accolades. These include being ranked 33rd and 7th, respectively on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;’s 2021 and 2004 versions of 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; It was also included as one of the 27 songs on the Voyager Golden Record, a collection of music, images, and sounds designed to serve as an introduction and record of global humanity’s achievements, innovations and culture, to alien/otherworldly inhabitants.

== Composition and recording ==
Written by Chuck Berry in 1955, the song is about an illiterate &quot;country boy&quot; from the New Orleans area, who plays a guitar &quot;just like ringing a bell&quot;, and who might one day have his &quot;name in lights&quot;. Berry acknowledged that the song is partly autobiographical and that the original lyrics referred to Johnny as a &quot;colored boy&quot;, but he changed it to &quot;country boy&quot; to ensure radio play. As well as suggesting that the guitar player is good, the title hints at autobiographic elements, because Berry was born at 2520 Goode Avenue, in St. Louis.

The song was initially inspired by Johnnie Johnson, the regular piano player in Berry&#x27;s band, but developed into a song mainly about Berry himself. Johnson played on many recordings by Berry, but for the Chess recording session Lafayette Leake played the piano, along with Willie Dixon on bass and Fred Below on drums. The session was produced by Leonard and Phil Chess. The guitarist Keith Richards later suggested that the song&#x27;s chords are more typical of compositions written for piano than for guitar.

The opening guitar riff of &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; borrows from the opening single-note solo on Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Just Like a Woman&quot; (1946), played by guitarist Carl Hogan.

One notable feature of Berry&#x27;s recording is the contrast between the swing of the drums and piano backing, and the &quot;straight&quot; (non-swinging) rhythm and lead guitar. 

==Legacy==

In &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Joe Queenan argued that &quot;no song in the history of rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll more jubilantly celebrates the downmarket socioeconomic roots of the genre&quot; than &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;. In &quot;Billboard&quot;, Jason Lipshutz stated that the song was &quot;the first rock-star origin story&quot;, and that it featured &quot;a swagger and showmanship that had not yet invaded radio.&quot;

When Chuck Berry was honored in the first Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on January 23, 1986, he performed &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, backed by Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. The Hall of Fame included both songs as well as &quot;Maybellene&quot; in their list of the 500 songs that shaped rock and roll. The song was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, for its influence as a rock and roll single.

The song appears on the 1973 &quot;American Graffiti&quot; soundtrack album. 

&quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; has been recorded in cover versions by a wide variety of artists in different genres. In 1969, country musician Buck Owens&#x27;s version from his album &quot;Buck Owens in London &quot;Live&quot;&quot; topped &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Hot Country Sides chart. In 1972, Jimi Hendrix had a posthumous hit with a live version from the live album &quot;Hendrix in the West&quot; peaking at number 35 on the UK Singles Chart and later reaching number 13 on the New Zealand Top 50 in 1986. Peter Tosh&#x27;s 1983 rendition from his album &quot;Mama Africa&quot; peaked at number 84 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, number 48 on the UK Singles Chart, number 10 in the Netherlands, and number 29 in New Zealand. In 1988, Judas Priest&#x27;s version from their album &quot;Ram It Down&quot; reached number 64 on the UK Singles Chart. The Sex Pistols also covered it for their soundtrack &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; in 1979. Elton John&#x27;s cover of the song is the opening track of his 1979 album &quot;Victim of Love&quot;.

Devo paid homage to Berry&#x27;s song in their song &quot;Come Back Jonee&quot; on the group&#x27;s 1978 debut album &quot;Q. Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!&quot;.

Berry&#x27;s recording is included (as the eleventh track of disc 1) among the musical samples and sounds on the Voyager Golden Record, sent to travel into deep space beyond the solar system on both Voyager spacecraft, launched in 1977.

A cover version is featured in the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot; (1985) when lead character Marty McFly, played by actor Michael J. Fox, performs it at a high school dance. Impressed, fictional bandleader Marvin Berry (Harry Waters Jr.) calls up his cousin Chuck and makes him listen to the song, telling him it&#x27;s &quot;that new sound you&#x27;re looking for&quot;, thus making it a bootstrap paradox. Fox explained his approach was to &quot;incorporate all the characteristics and mannerisms and quirks of my favourite guitarists, so a Pete Townshend windmill, and Jimi Hendrix behind the back, and a Chuck Berry duckwalk. And we worked all that in.&quot;

The Grateful Dead often performed the song live, purportedly playing it at least 287 times.

The animated TV series &quot;Ninjago&quot; pays homage to &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; several times throughout the show with a track titled &quot;Dareth the Guitar Man&quot; (also known as &quot;Dareth The Man&quot; or &quot;Dareth&#x27;s Blues&quot;), which features similar musical themes to the song.

<text>Cheating at Solitaire is the first solo album from Social Distortion frontman Mike Ness. Released in 1999, it bypasses much of Social Distortion&#x27;s punk muscle in favor of a more roots-oriented approach to rock and roll. It features cameos by Bruce Springsteen, Brian Setzer, and members of Royal Crown Revue. Johnny Cash was invited to perform on the song &quot;Ballad of a Lonely Man&quot;, but was too ill to record at the time.

&quot;Dope Fiend Blues&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m In Love w/My Car&quot; were originally written/recorded in 1994 as a demo of Social Distortion&#x27;s fifth album &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;. Ness also originally wrote some of the songs on this album around 1997 while Social Distortion was planning their sixth album.

<text>The Funeral is a 1996 American crime-drama film directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken, Chris Penn, Annabella Sciorra, Isabella Rossellini, Vincent Gallo, Benicio del Toro and Gretchen Mol.

The story concerns the funeral of one of three brothers in a family of gangsters that lived in New York City in 1930s. It details, through a series of flashbacks, the past of the brothers and their families.

Chris Penn won the Volpi Cup for Best Supporting Actor at the 1996 Venice Film Festival for his performance. The film received five Independent Spirit Awards nominations, including Best Film, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Screenplay and Best Cinematography.

==Plot==
The film begins with the funeral of one of the three Tempio brothers, a set of violent criminals. Mourning the passage of their beloved brother Johnny are Chez and Ray. Ray is cold and calculating, while Chez is hot tempered. Flashbacks demonstrate Johnny to be more sensitive. Exposure to communist meetings as a spy sways Johnny&#x27;s opinions. The chief suspect in Johnny&#x27;s murder is rival gangster Gaspare Spoglia.

Ray and Chez swear revenge. Ray&#x27;s wife, Jeanette, opposes the campaign of retribution and the violence it will bring, while Chez&#x27; wife, Clara, struggles to deal with her husband&#x27;s obsessive nature.

Ray has Gaspare abducted for interrogation and they go to see Johnny&#x27;s body. He is satisfied by Gaspare&#x27;s claim of innocence, in part because he says that gangsters are superstitious, believing that the wounds of the corpse will start bleeding in the presence of the killer. Therefore the killer will not willingly enter the dead victim&#x27;s presence. Gaspare is comfortable to be in the presence of the victim, so is not the killer. Ray releases Gaspare but instructs his men to murder him later.

As it turns out, Johnny was not murdered by rival gangsters, but by a man who claimed Johnny had raped his girlfriend. Ray&#x27;s men identify him by tracking the car he had driven to commit the crime. Pressed by Ray, the killer confesses that he had wanted revenge because Johnny had beaten him up in front of his girlfriend and friends. Ray kills him.

As he buries the dead murderer, Chez reflects on his brothers&#x27; lives before the tragedy. He then returns to Ray&#x27;s house and shoots and kills Ray and his two bodyguards. Chez then shoots Johnny, lying dead in the casket, before putting the gun in his own mouth and committing suicide as the family women wail over Ray&#x27;s dying body.

==Cast==
==Production==
Vincent Gallo alleged that Ferrara was &quot;high on crack&quot; while directing this film.

==Reception==
Reception from critics was positive, as &quot;The Funeral&quot; holds a 79% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 34 reviews. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Abel Ferrara reunites with Christopher Walken to forge another haunting gangster saga, delivering a bruising exploration of vengeance.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave &quot;The Funeral&quot; three stars out of four, praising the acting especially. Janet Maslin of &quot;New York Times&quot; also gave a positive review, calling it &quot;hotblooded&quot; and &quot;well-acted&quot;. In &quot;Entertainment Weekly,&quot; Ken Tucker described the film as &quot;fine, thoughtful, and jolting&quot;. David Parkinson of &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, praising the &quot;complex characters&quot; and &quot;impressive cast&quot;.

In November 2017, RBC was added to the Financial Stability Board&#x27;s list of global systemically important banks.

In Canada, the bank&#x27;s personal and commercial banking operations are branded as &quot;RBC Royal Bank&quot; in English and &quot;RBC Banque Royale&quot; in French and serves approximately 11 million clients through its network of 1,284 branches. RBC Bank is a US banking subsidiary which formerly operated 439 branches across six states in the Southeastern United States, but now only offers cross-border banking services to Canadian travellers and expats. RBC&#x27;s other Los Angeles-based US subsidiary City National Bank operates 79 branches across 11 US states. RBC also has 127 branches across seventeen countries in the Caribbean, which serve more than 16 million clients.

==History==
In 1864, the Merchants Bank of Halifax was founded in Halifax, Nova Scotia, as a commercial bank that financed the fishing and timber industries and the European and Caribbean import/export businesses. By 1869 the Merchants&#x27; Bank was officially incorporated and received its federal charter in the same year. During the 1870s and 1880s, the bank expanded into the other Maritime Provinces. When both the Newfoundland Commercial Bank and Union Bank of Newfoundland collapsed on December 10, 1894, the Merchants Bank expanded to Newfoundland on January 31, 1895.

As the bank grew, executives changed its name to reflect its growth and western expansion. In 1901, the Merchants Bank of Halifax changed its name to the Royal Bank of Canada (RBC). The centre of the Canadian financial industry had moved from Halifax to Montreal, so the Merchants Bank relocated its head office there. In 1910, RBC merged with the Union Bank of Halifax. In the same year it built a bank branch in Winnipeg, Manitoba, designed by Carrère and Hastings, in beaux-arts classicism proclaiming the financial dominance of Winnipeg in the prairies. To improve its position in Ontario, RBC merged with Traders Bank of Canada in 1912 and in 1917 RBC merged with Quebec Bank, which was founded in 1818 and chartered in 1822 in Quebec City.

RBC&#x27;s presence in Manitoba and Saskatchewan was strengthened through a 1918 merger with Northern Crown Bank, the product of the 1908 merger of Northern Bank (established in 1905 in Winnipeg) and Crown Bank of Canada (1904), based in Ontario. RBC&#x27;s presence in the Canadian Prairie was further expanded by the 1925 merger with the Union Bank of Canada, which had begun in Quebec City in 1865 as the Union Bank of Lower Canada, but changed its name in 1886. The Union Bank of Canada had moved its headquarters to Winnipeg in 1912, and had built a strong presence in the Prairies and opened the first bank in the Northwest Territories at Fort Smith in 1921.

In 1935, RBC merged with Crown Savings and Loan Co. merged with Industrial Mortgage &amp; Trust Co.

RoyWest Banking Corporation was formed in Nassau, Bahamas in 1965, to undertake medium-term lending and trustee business in the British West Indies. Majority owned by seven firms, including RBC and Westminster Bank, sole ownership transferred to National Westminster Bank in 1987.

RBC installed its first computer in 1961, the IBM 1401, the first to do so in Canadian banking. In the 1960s, RBC Insurance was created. In 1968, it merged with Ontario Loan and Debenture Company (formerly Ontario Savings and Investment Society). RBC Insurance is the largest Canadian bank-owned insurance organization, with services to over five million people. It provides life, health, travel, home and auto and reinsurance products as well as creditor and business insurance services. The completion of Royal Bank Plaza in Toronto in 1976 saw the relocation of many critical head-office functions from Montreal, with Toronto serving as RBC&#x27;s corporate headquarters ever since. In 1993, RBC merged with Royal Trust.

In 1998, RBC acquired Security First Network Bank in Atlanta—the first pure Internet bank. In the same year, the Royal Bank of Canada proposed to merge with the Bank of Montreal, at the same time as the Toronto-Dominion Bank proposed to merge with the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. Both mergers were examined by the Competition Bureau of Canada, and ultimately rejected by Paul Martin, at the time the Finance Minister of Canada, and future Prime Minister.

In 2000, RBC merged merchant credit/debit card acquiring business with the Bank of Montreal&#x27;s to form Moneris Solutions. In 2013, RBC completed the acquisition of the Canadian subsidiary of Ally Financial.

An RBC branch in The Glebe neighbourhood of Ottawa was firebombed in May 2010. The party responsible later identified themselves on Independent Media Center and threatened to make their presence at the upcoming 2010 G20 Toronto summit.

In November 2022, RBC and HSBC Canada announced a deal which would see RBC acquiring 100% of the common shares of HSBC Canada for an all-cash purchase price of $13.5 billion, a multiple of 9.4 times HSBC Canada&#x27;s estimated 2024 earnings. Completion of the transaction is expected by late 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. In December 2023, RBC received approval from Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland to take over HSBC Bank in a deal. Conditions for the deal include that none of HSBC Canada&#x27;s 4,000 employees will be laid off within six months of the closing date or two years for direct staff, and banking services will be provided at 33 HSBC branches for at least another four years. RBC will also provide $7 billion in financing for affordable housing developments in Canada.

The bank&#x27;s first modern identity was designed by firm Lippincott &amp; Margulies, and was introduced in January 1962. From this point forward the bank&#x27;s logo has contained the same basic element of a stylized lion clutching a globe, becoming more simplified with each iteration. Alongside promotion of the Royal Bank Plaza, a tweaked version of the mark by Montreal design consultancy Gottschalk + Ash silently debuted in June 1979. The same basic form was retained, however many lines were thickened and details simplified to facilitate printing at small sizes. The total brand overhaul and shortening of the Royal Bank name to RBC in August 2001 coincided with their expansion into the United States market. The direction of the lion, now further simplified, was reversed, the crown above omitted, and both the symbol and wordmark were placed within a blue shield.

===Sponsorship===
RBC sponsors cultural events including the Toronto International Film Festival. It also sponsors the RBC Taylor Prize, a literary award for non-fiction writing in Canada, and hosts a yearly Canadian Women Entrepreneur Award. In July 2013, the RBC Foundation partnered with the University of Toronto to revive the Siminovitch Prize in Theatre, given to recognize achievement in Canadian theatre.

RBC is one of Canada&#x27;s largest sponsors of amateur sports and is the longest-running Canadian sponsor of the Olympic Games. It employs dozens of top-tier amateur athletes as part-time spokespeople through the RBC Olympians program. RBC is a former premier sponsor of Hockey Canada and previously owned the naming rights to the National Junior A Championship, then called the Royal Bank Cup (later the RBC Cup). In addition, it supports Canadian hockey at the grassroots level through the RBC Play Hockey program.

RBC owns naming rights to the RBC Centre, RBC Convention Centre Winnipeg, RBC Canadian Open, and RBC Heritage (formerly the Heritage Classic). From 2002 to 2012, RBC previously held the naming rights to what is now the PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina.

RBC has owned naming rights for the Top 25 Canadian Immigrants Award, presented annually by &quot;Canadian Immigrant&quot;, since 2013.

RBC has also sponsored Major League Soccer in the United States since 2023. In 2025, RBC and its Los Angeles-based subsidiary City National Bank signed with the LA Galaxy to have its logo placed on the team&#x27;s jersey sleeve and throughout the stadium.

== Head offices ==

The head office for the institution was initially located at the Merchants&#x27; Bank of Halifax Building, on Bedford Row, Halifax, Nova Scotia. The building served as the head office for the bank from 1864 to 1907. In 1907, the RBC relocated its head office to the Four Pillars Building, at 147 Saint Jacques Street (renumbered 221 in 1928), Montreal. The building was used as RBC&#x27;s head office until 1928. The Four Pillars Building was later demolished, with only its facade remaining. In 1928, RBC moved its head office to the Old Royal Bank Building, at 360 Saint Jacques Street, Montreal.

In 1962, RBC moved its head office to Place Ville-Marie, at University Street and René-Lévesque Boulevard in Montreal. In 1976, RBC completed Royal Bank Plaza, at 200 Bay Street, Toronto, and shifted the majority of its critical head-office functions from Montreal to Toronto. The Royal Bank of Canada presently operates two headquarters, with its corporate headquarters at Royal Bank Plaza and its head office based at Place Ville-Marie. Most of its management operations are based in Toronto.

==Controversies==
===Discrimination===
On January 15, 2007, CBC Radio reported RBC was &quot;refusing&quot; to open US dollar accounts for people of certain nationalities. Canadian citizens with dual citizenship in Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Myanmar, North Korea or Sudan (mostly countries with US sanctions) were affected. The US Treasury Department restricts certain foreign nationals from using the US dollar payment system to limit terrorism and money laundering after the September 11, 2001, attacks. RBC replied that compliance with such laws does not represent an endorsement by the bank and on January 17, clarified its position on the application of the US laws, specifying that &quot;with some exceptions&quot; it does open accounts for dual citizens of the sanctioned countries. There have also been reports that the bank had closed the accounts of some Iranian-Canadian citizens.

===Environment===
According to a report by Rainforest Action Network, RBC&#x27;s financing of oil sands bitumen extraction and expansion amounted to &quot;more than $2.3 billion in loans and financing [of] more than $6.9 billion in [corporate] debt between 2003 and 2007 for 13 companies including: Encana, Husky Energy, OPTI Canada, Delphi Energy, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Northwest Upgrading, Suncor, TotalEnergies, Connacher Oil and Gas, InterPipeline and Enbridge&quot;.

A 2020 report on fossil fuel finance by the Sierra Club and Rainforest Action Network found that RBC was the fifth largest funder of fossil fuels in the world, and largest in Canada, investing over US$160 billion on fossil fuel projects since the Paris Agreement in 2015. This sparked criticism from environmental groups and climate activists.

A more recent 2023 report from a coalition of environmental group places RBC as the largest financier of fossil fuel in the world in 2022, investing US$42 billion in fossil fuel projects in that year alone.

=== Funding of SCO litigation on Linux ===
RBC invested in SCO Group during the series of court cases seeking to collect royalties from the users of Linux.

=== Investor protection ===
In 2014, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fined RBC $35,000,000 for engaging in more than 1,000 wash sales, fictitious sales, and other non-competitive practices over a three-year period.

===Mismarking===
In 2007, the Royal Bank of Canada fired several traders in its corporate bond business, after another trader accused them of mismarking bonds the bank held by overpricing them, and marked down the values of the bonds and recognized $13 million of trading losses relating to the bonds. The bank said it investigated the accusations, and took remedial action. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; noted: &quot;traders might have an incentive to boost [the bonds&#x27;] prices because it could have an impact on their bonuses.&quot;

===Temporary foreign workers and Canadian layoffs===
In April 2013, the CBC reported that the Royal Bank of Canada was indirectly hiring temporary foreign workers to replace 45 Canadian information technology workers.

The CBC reported on May 7, 2013, that, during Question Period in Parliament, the NDP leveled accusations against the government and then Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper responded that the government has been working on problems with the Temporary Foreign Worker Program for more than a year.

=== Vacation pay class action lawsuit ===

On December 29, 2022, the Supreme Court of Ontario certified a class action lawsuit permitting employees of RBC Dominion Securities to seek $800 million in damages, over alleged unpaid wages for holidays and other vacation days.

==Memberships==
RBC is a member of the Canadian Bankers Association which includes Canada&#x27;s Big Five banks, and is a registered member with the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, a federal agency insuring deposits at all of Canada&#x27;s chartered banks.

It is also a member of:

<text>Tindersticks are an English alternative rock band formed in Nottingham in 1991. They released six albums before singer Stuart A. Staples embarked on a solo career. The band reunited briefly in 2006 and more permanently the following year. The band recorded several film soundtracks, and have a long-standing collaboration with French director Claire Denis.

==History==
Staples, Boulter, Fraser, Macauley and Hinchliffe, all former members of Asphalt Ribbons, formed the band in 1991. The final line-up for the &quot;Old Horse&quot; mini-LP (1991) was: Stuart Staples (vocals), Dave Boulter (organ and accordion), Neil Fraser (guitar), Dickon Hinchliffe (guitar and strings), Al Macauley (percussion and drums), and John Thompson (bass). Mark Colwill was recruited when Thompson left the Asphalt Ribbons, but it is not known if he played any gigs under the Asphalt Ribbons name. They then changed their name to Tindersticks after Staples discovered a box of German matches on a Greek beach.

Tindersticks started recording demo tapes in 1992, and formed their own label Tippy Toe Records to release their first single, &quot;Patchwork&quot;, in the same year.

Their self-titled first and second albums established their signature sound and received widespread critical acclaim. Their live performances, often augmented by large string sections and even, on occasion, a full orchestra, were well received. The live album &quot;The Bloomsbury Theatre 12.3.95&quot; is a recording of one such concert. By the time of the third album, &quot;Curtains&quot;, however, it was clear that a change of direction was called for.

The fourth album, &quot;Simple Pleasure&quot;, lived up to its title with a series of snappy, direct songs influenced by soul music. The female backing vocals on several tracks, and the respectful cover of Odyssey&#x27;s &quot;If You&#x27;re Looking for a Way Out&quot;, signalled the band&#x27;s wish to move towards lighter, more soulful material. However, the inner sleeve&#x27;s documentation of the number of takes each track went through was evidence that the band continued to adopt a painstaking approach to recording.

The fifth album, &quot;Can Our Love...&quot;, continued the band&#x27;s soulful direction, in particular evidence on the tender &quot;Sweet Release&quot; and in the nod to The Chi-Lites in the title of &quot;Chilitetime&quot;.

The sixth album, &quot;Waiting for the Moon&quot;, was more stripped down and introspective in nature, particularly on the harrowing &quot;4.48 Psychosis&quot; (based on the play of the same name by the British playwright Sarah Kane) and &quot;Sometimes It Hurts&quot;. Only the bouncy &quot;Just a Dog&quot; lightened the otherwise melancholy mood of the album.

In 2005, Staples embarked on a solo career and there was resultant speculation that the band had split. During this period, Staples produced two solo albums, &quot;Lucky Dog Recordings 03-04&quot; and &quot;Leaving Songs&quot;. The title of the second album, and Staples&#x27; notes on it, indicated that change was in the air: &quot;These are songs written on the verge of leaving the things I loved and stepping into a new unknown life, both musically and personally. I was always aware that these songs were the end of something, a kind of closing a circle of a way of writing that I started so long ago and I knew I had to move on from.&quot;

In September 2006, the band played a one-off concert at London&#x27;s Barbican Centre, performing their second album in full with a nine-member string section and two brass players, including former collaborator Terry Edwards on trumpet.

Staples later acknowledged that this show, while being a happy triumph, was also &quot;tinged with sadness of the knowledge that the six of us had made all the new music we were going to make together.&quot; However, it also rekindled his determination to make a new album.

In 2007, a stripped-down line-up of three of the original band, Staples, Boulter and Fraser, spent time writing and recording in a newly equipped studio in Limousin, France. They were joined by Thomas Belhom on drums and Dan McKinna on bass, with Ian Caple engineering. The resulting album, &quot;The Hungry Saw&quot;, was released on Beggars Banquet in April 2008. Tindersticks played a number of other European dates during the summer festival season and also announced a winter 2008 European tour.

In 2010, the eighth studio album &quot;Falling Down a Mountain&quot; was released on 4AD/Constellation Records with a changed band line-up, with Earl Harvin replacing Belhom on drums and David Kitt, a solo artist in his own right, joining the band on guitar and vocals.

The group&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;The Something Rain&quot; was released in February 2012. The following tours in spring, summer (festival concerts) and autumn, showed the band now touring in their again reduced 5-member core line-up (Stuart Staples, David Boulter, Neil Fraser, Dan McKinna and Earl Harvin), supported at selected gigs by Terry Edwards on horns.

In October 2013, after missing the band&#x27;s 20th anniversary the years before, the band released their tenth studio album, the retrospective &quot;Across Six Leap Years&quot;, containing ten re-recorded songs from their back-catalog and from Stuart A. Staples solo album period. In the autumn of 2013 they toured several European capital cities in their &quot;Across Six Leap Years&quot; anniversary tour, supported by Terry Edwards on saxophone and horns and Gina Foster on backing vocals.

In 2016 they released their eleventh studio album &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;, followed by an extensive tour in February to May 2016.

Their 12th studio album, &quot;No Treasure But Hope&quot;, was released in later 2019 to positive reviews, with a tour planned for 2020. Ahead of these tour dates, the band released the four-song &quot;See My Girls&quot; EP along with a video for the title track.

U.S. and European tour dates were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why the core band focused on working on a new album during 2020. In January 2021, the band announced their thirteenth regular album &quot;Distractions&quot;, which was released on February 19 and charted at number 15 in the Offizielle Deutsche Charts&#x27; Album Top 100 in Germany. Their fourteenth album, &quot;Soft Tissue&quot;, was released on 10 September 2024.

==Soundtrack work==
* As well as their thirteen regular studio albums, the band has composed and recorded the music for seven films by the French director Claire Denis: &quot;Nénette et Boni&quot;, &quot;Trouble Every Day&quot;, &quot;35 Shots of Rum&quot;, &quot;White Material&quot;, &quot;Les Salauds&quot;, &quot;Both Sides of the Blade&quot;, and &quot;Stars at Noon&quot;. Band members Stuart A. Staples and Dickon Hinchliffe have also composed soundtracks for other Denis films (&quot;The Intruder&quot; and &quot;&quot;High Life&quot;&quot; by Staples, and &quot;Friday Night&quot; by Hinchliffe).
* Band members Stuart Staples and Dan McKinna composed the accompanying orchestral soundscape to the Belgian In Flanders Fields Museum. The six-part work, played on a continuous loop in varying sections of the museum was released as the Tindersticks album &quot;Ypres&quot; in 2014. 
* Tindersticks recorded a cover version of the Four Tops song, &quot;What Is a Man&quot;, for the theme to the British TV series &quot;The Sins&quot;. This was released as a non-album single
* The Tindersticks song &quot;Tiny Tears&quot; was featured prominently in the Season 1 episode &quot;Isabella&quot; of HBO&#x27;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot;. Sections from a 14-minute instrumental mix of &quot;Running Wild&quot; served as the end credits music for the penultimate episode of the series, &quot;The Blue Comet.&quot; The same track was used repeatedly in Alex Gibney&#x27;s 2024 documentary on series creator David Chase.
* In the season one finale of &quot;Brotherhood&quot;, &quot;El Diablo En El Ojo&quot; is used twice.
* In 2009, Tindersticks&#x27; &quot;The Organist Entertains&quot; was featured in the closing credits of an episode of the HBO series &quot;Eastbound &amp; Down&quot;. &quot;Hubbards Hill&quot; was used in the closing credits of another episode, &quot;Chapter 9&quot;, in 2010.
* The Tindersticks song &quot;Cherry Blossoms&quot; was featured in the 2009 film &quot;Unmade Beds&quot;.
* Dickon Hinchliffe has composed film music since 2002, and has been active as a full-time composer in this field since his departure from Tindersticks. Among his work are the soundtracks to Niall Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Keeping Mum&quot; (2005), Joel Hopkins&#x27; &quot;Last Chance Harvey&quot; (2008), Sophie Barthes&#x27; &quot;Cold Souls&quot; (2009), James Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Red Riding: In the Year of Our Lord 1980&quot; (2009), &quot;Project Nim&quot; (2011), and &quot;Shadow Dancer&quot;; and Debra Granik&#x27;s Oscar-nominated film &quot;Winter&#x27;s Bone&quot; (2010), &quot;Lennon Naked&quot; (2010), &quot;Passion Play&quot; (2011), &quot;The Fields&quot; (2011), &quot;Rampart&quot; (2011), and &quot;Hit &amp; Miss&quot; (2012), and more recently &quot;Locke&quot; (2013), &quot;Out of the Furnace&quot; (2013), series 3 of &quot;Peaky Blinders&quot; (2016), and &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; (2018).

==Musical style==
Their sound is characterised by orchestral backing, lounge jazz, and soul; the orchestrations of multi-instrumentalist Dickon Hinchliffe (who left the band in 2006) and the baritone of lead vocalist Stuart A. Staples are the band&#x27;s hallmarks. Tindersticks augment their instrumentation with Rhodes piano, glockenspiel, vibraphone, violin, trumpet, trombone, clarinet, bassoon and Hammond organ.

<text>&#x27; (Italian for &quot;Idomeneus, King of Crete, or, Ilia and Idamante&quot;; usually referred to simply as Idomeneo&quot;&quot;&#x27;, K. 366) is an Italian-language opera seria by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The libretto was adapted by Giambattista Varesco from a French text by Antoine Danchet, based on a 1705 play by Crébillion père, which had been set to music by André Campra as &quot;Idoménée&quot; in 1712. Mozart and Varesco were commissioned in 1780 by Karl Theodor, Elector of Bavaria for a court carnival. He probably chose the subject, though it may have been Mozart. The work premiered on 29 January 1781 at the Cuvilliés Theatre in Munich, Germany.

==Composition==

The libretto clearly draws inspiration from Metastasio in its overall layout, the type of character development, and the highly poetic language used in the various numbers and the &quot;secco&quot; and &quot;stromentato&quot; recitatives. The style of the choruses, marches, and ballets is very French, and the shipwreck scene towards the end of act 1 is almost identical to the structure and dramatic working-out of a similar scene in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot;. The sacrifice and oracle scenes are similar to Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot; and &quot;Alceste&quot;.

Kurt Kramer has suggested that Varesco was familiar with Calzabigi and therefore the work of Gluck, especially the latter&#x27;s &quot;Alceste&quot;; much of what we see in Varesco&#x27;s most dramatic passages is the latest French style, mediated by Calzabigi. It is thanks to Mozart, though, that this mixture of French styles (apart from a few choruses) moves away from Gluck and France and returns to its more Italian (&quot;opera seria&quot;) roots; the singers were all trained in the classical Italian style, after all, and the recitatives are all classically Italian.

==Ballet music, K. 367==
As per French tradition, the opera uses ballet to its advantage. Mozart wrote one to be performed in the opera (K. 367) which he considered more of a Lullian divertissement. It is in several parts and lasts around fifteen minutes.

The structure is as follows. The first four dances transition into each other, while the last three are separate.

#Chaconne (Allegro) in D major, 
#Annonce (Larghetto) in B-flat major, 
#Chaconne &quot;qui reprenda&quot; (Allegro, starts in D minor, then goes to D major), 
#Pas seul (Largo) in D major — Allegretto (attacca), — Piu Allegro (attacca), — Piu allegro (attacca), 
#Passepied in B-flat, 
#Gavotte in G, 
#Passacaille in E-flat major, (unfinished)

The ballet is scored for the opera&#x27;s full orchestra of flutes, oboes, clarinets (only present in the passacaille), bassoons, horns, trumpets, timpani, and strings. It showcases the many famous techniques of the Mannheim orchestra, including stupefying crescendos and &quot;tutti&quot; passages. Throughout the manuscript, Mozart wrote the dancers who would be partaking in a specific section of the ballet; id est, &quot;Pas seul de Mad. Falgera&quot;, or &quot;Pas seul de Mr. [Jean-Pierre] Le Grand&quot;, who was the main choreographer for the opera&#x27;s Munich premiere.

It is unclear exactly where Mozart had intended the divertissement to occur in the opera. In the &quot;Neue Mozart-Ausgabe&quot;, Harald Heckmann suggests that it was performed after the first act, but Daniel Heartz states that it must have been performed after the final chorus of the third and last act, citing the majesty and pomposity of the D major &quot;Pas seul&quot;, perfect for concluding an opera.

Along with the Chaconne up to the &quot;Pas seul&quot;, which form a consistent whole via &quot;attacca&quot; transitions, the manuscript is bound with three other dances; a passepied in B-flat, a gavotte in G (which is rather famous; Tchaikovsky conducted it at one of his Russian Musical Society concerts), and an unfinished &quot;passacaille&quot; in E-flat. Due to the separation from the first half of the ballet, as well as the incomplete status of them, Daniel Heartz speculates that they were simply never performed.

Gluck&#x27;s influence on Mozart is demonstrated as the Chaconne begins with a musical quotation from Gluck&#x27;s ballet from &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot;.

==Performance history==

It was first performed at the Cuvilliés Theatre of the Munich Residenz on 29 January 1781, under the musical direction of Christian Cannabich. The opera apparently owed much of its success at its first performance to the set designs: a notice in the Munich press did not mention Mozart by name but said (translation): &quot;The author, composer and translator are all natives of Salzburg; the decors, among which the view of the port and Neptune&#x27;s temple were outstanding, were masterpieces by our renowned theatre designer, court Councillor Lorenzo Quaglio, and everyone admired them tremendously.&quot; &quot;Idomeneo&quot; was Mozart&#x27;s first mature opera, in which he – unique among composers – for the first time and continuing this for all his subsequent operas, ended the work in the key of the overture. With &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, he demonstrated a mastery of orchestral color, accompanied recitatives, and melodic line. Mozart fought with the librettist, the court chaplain Varesco, making large cuts and changes, even down to specific words and vowels disliked by the singers (too many &quot;i&quot;s in &quot;rinvigorir&quot;, which in Italian are pronounced as in bee).

&quot;Idomeneo&quot; was performed three times in Munich. Later in 1781 Mozart considered (but did not put into effect) revisions that would have brought the work closer into line with Gluck&#x27;s style; this would have meant a bass Idomeneo and a tenor Idamante.

A concert performance was given in 1786 at the Palais Auersperg in Vienna. For this, Mozart wrote some new music, made some cuts, and changed Idamante from a castrato to a tenor.

The British premiere was given by the amateur Glasgow Grand Opera Society in 1934. The first performance in the United States was produced by Boris Goldovsky at the Berkshire Music Festival at Tanglewood during the summer of 1947.

Today &quot;Idomeneo&quot; is part of the standard operatic repertoire. There are several recordings of it (see below), and it is regularly performed.

In 2006 there was a controversy over the cancelling of a 2003 production directed by Hans Neuenfels at the Deutsche Oper Berlin (see 2006 Idomeneo controversy).

===Richard Strauss version===
The approach of the 150th anniversary of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;&#x27;s premiere placed some major European opera houses in a quandary: commemorative performances of so magnificent and historically important a score seemed obligatory, but, at the same time, how dared they mount an opera that 1930/31 audiences were bound to reject as hopelessly unstageworthy? The solution hit on in Munich and Vienna was to have &quot;Idomeneo&quot; adapted for modern tastes, but to show due reverence to Mozart&#x27;s genius by entrusting the adaptations to famous twentieth-century opera composers with impeccable credentials as Mozarteans. Thus Munich commissioned an &quot;Idomeneo&quot; revision from Ermanno Wolf-Ferrari, performed in 1931, and the same year the Vienna State Opera presented a distinctively interventionist version of the score by Richard Strauss.

For his adaptation of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, Strauss employed a German libretto by Lothar Wallerstein that was partially a translation of the original Italian libretto, but with some changes to reflect the rearranging of the music. Strauss replaced about 1/3 of Mozart&#x27;s score with some of his own music (even introducing the &quot;Fall of Troy&quot; motif from his own 1928 opera &quot;Die ägyptische Helena&quot;), and rearranged much of the music left behind. For example, Ilia&#x27;s opening aria &quot;&quot; is mostly intact with a few changes to the long introductory recitative, but when Idamante (specifically written to be sung by a tenor in this version) enters, he sings Mozart&#x27;s Non piu, tutto ascoltai, K490 (which was added to Mozart&#x27;s original revision of &quot;Idomeneo&quot;) instead of &quot;&quot;. A few major changes to the plot were made as well, such as changing princess Elettra to priestess Ismene. Critics have noted that Strauss&#x27;s additions contain an interesting blend of the classical style of composition and Strauss&#x27;s own characteristic sound. In 1984, New York&#x27;s Mostly Mozart Festival presented Strauss&#x27;s version with Jerry Hadley in the title role, Delores Ziegler as Idamante, and Alessandra Marc as Ismene.

==Synopsis==
===Overture===
The overture, in D major and common time, is in a modified sonata form in which the development is but a very short transition section connecting the exposition with the recapitulation. Other conventional hallmarks of the sonata form are apparent: the exposition modulates from the tonic (D major) to the dominant (A major), while the recapitulation is centred on the tonic. The overture concludes with a coda ending in D major chords. These chords, soft and tentative, turn out not to be a resolution of the overture in the tonic but chords in the dominant of G minor, which is the home key of the scene that immediately follows.

===Act 1===
Island of Crete, shortly after the Trojan War. Ilia, daughter of the defeated Trojan King Priam, has been taken to Crete after the war. She loves Prince Idamante, son of the Cretan King Idomeneo, but hesitates to acknowledge her love. Idamante frees the Trojan prisoners in a gesture of good will. He tells Ilia, who is rejecting his love, that it is not his fault that their fathers were enemies. Trojans and Cretans together welcome the return of peace, but Electra, daughter of the Greek King Agamemnon, is jealous of Ilia and does not approve of Idamante&#x27;s clemency toward the enemy prisoners. Arbace, the king&#x27;s confidant, brings news that Idomeneo has been lost at sea while returning to Crete from Troy. Electra, fearing that Ilia, a Trojan, will soon become Queen of Crete, feels the furies of the underworld rise up in her heart (aria: &quot;Tutte nel cor vi sento, furie del crudo averno&quot; – &quot;I feel you all in my heart, furies of the cruel underworld&quot;).

Idomeneo is saved by Neptune (god of the sea) and is washed up on a Cretan beach. There he recalls the vow he made to Neptune: to sacrifice, if he should arrive safely on land, the first living creature he should meet. Idamante approaches him, but because the two have not seen each other for a long time, recognition is difficult. When Idomeneo finally realizes the youth that he must sacrifice for the sake of his vow is his own child, he orders Idamante never to seek him out again. Grief-stricken by his father&#x27;s rejection, Idamante runs off. Cretan troops disembarking from Idomeneo&#x27;s ship are met by their wives, and all praise Neptune.

===Act 2===
At the king&#x27;s palace, Idomeneo seeks counsel from Arbace, who says another victim could be sacrificed if Idamante were sent into exile. Idomeneo orders his son to escort Electra to her home, Argos. Idomeneo&#x27;s kind words to Ilia move her to declare that since she has lost everything, he will be her father and Crete her country. As she leaves, Idomeneo realizes that sending Idamante into exile has cost Ilia her happiness as well as his own. Electra welcomes the idea of going to Argos with Idamante.

At the port of Sidon (a fictional city of Crete), Idomeneo bids his son farewell and urges him to learn the art of ruling while he is away. Before the ship can sail, however, a storm breaks out, and a sea serpent appears. Recognizing it as a messenger from Neptune, the king offers himself as atonement for having violated his vow to the god.

===Act 3===
In the royal garden, Ilia asks the breezes to carry her love to Idamante, who appears, explaining that he must go to fight the serpent. When he says he would rather die than suffer the torments of his rejected love, Ilia confesses her love. They are surprised by Electra and Idomeneo. When Idamante asks his father why he sends him away, Idomeneo can only reply that the youth must leave. Ilia asks for consolation from Electra, who is preoccupied with revenge. Arbace comes with news that the people, led by the High Priest of Neptune, are clamoring for Idomeneo. The High Priest tells the king of the destruction caused by Neptune&#x27;s monster, urging Idomeneo to reveal the name of the person whose sacrifice is demanded by the god. When the king confesses that his own son is the victim, the populace is horrified.

Outside the temple, the king and High Priest join Neptune&#x27;s priests in prayer that the god may be appeased. Arbace brings news that Idamante has killed the monster. As Idomeneo fears new reprisals from Neptune, Idamante enters in sacrificial robes, saying he understands his father&#x27;s torment and is ready to die. After an agonizing farewell, Idomeneo is about to sacrifice his son when Ilia intervenes, offering her own life instead. The Voice of Neptune is heard. Idomeneo must yield the throne to Ilia and Idamante. Everyone is relieved except Electra, who longs for her own death. Idomeneo presents Idamante and his bride as the new rulers. The people call upon the god of love and marriage to bless the royal pair and bring peace.

<text>The Annan Plan (), also known as the Cyprus reunification plan, was a United Nations proposal to resolve the Cyprus dispute. The different parts of the proposal were based on the argumentation put forward by each party (Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots) in meetings held under the auspices of the UN. The proposal was to restructure the Republic of Cyprus to become the &quot;United Republic of Cyprus&quot; (; ), a federation of two states. It was revised a number of times before it was put to the people of Cyprus in a 2004 referendum, and was supported by 65% of Turkish Cypriots, but only 24% of Greek Cypriots.
==Proposal==
The Annan Plan (named after UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan) underwent five revisions before it reached its final version. The fifth revision proposed the creation of the United Republic of Cyprus, covering the island of Cyprus entirely except for the UK&#x27;s Sovereign Base Areas. This new country was to be a federation of two constituent states – the Greek Cypriot State and the Turkish Cypriot State – joined by a federal government apparatus.

This federal level, purported to be loosely based on the Swiss federal model, would incorporate the following elements:
* A collective Presidential Council, made up of six voting members, was allocated according to population (per present levels, four Greek Cypriots and two Turkish Cypriots), and selected and voted in by parliament. An additional three non-voting members would be assigned 2:1.
* A president and vice president, chosen by the Presidential Council from among its members, one from each community, to alternate in their functions every 10 months during the council&#x27;s five-year term of office.
* A bicameral legislature:
** A Senate (upper house), with 48 members, divided 24:24 between the two communities.
** A Chamber of Deputies (lower house), with 48 members, divided proportionately to the two communities&#x27; populations (with no fewer than 12 for the smaller community).
* A Supreme Court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot judges, plus three foreign judges; to be appointed by the Presidential Council.

The plan included a federal constitution, constitutions for each constituent state, a string of constitutional and federal laws, and a proposal for a United Cyprus Republic flag and a national anthem. It also provided for a Reconciliation Commission to bring the two communities closer together and resolve outstanding disputes from the past.

It would also have established a limited right to return between the territories of the two communities, and it would have allowed both Greece and Turkey to maintain a permanent military presence on the island, albeit with large, phased reductions in troop numbers.

==Negotiations==

===Annan Plans I &amp; II===
Following the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1250 of 29 June 1999, which requested the Secretary-General to invite the two leaders of the communities on Cyprus to negotiations, Álvaro de Soto was appointed as Special Advisor to the Secretary-General on Cyprus (1 November), the Secretary-General visited Turkey and U.S. President Bill Clinton visited Turkey and Greece (November), and proximity talks in New York were arranged beginning 3 December. The motivation for this renewed attempt at a Cyprus settlement was Cyprus&#x27; impending membership of the EU, and the fear that this development would create an obstacle to Turkey&#x27;s hopes of joining. This prospect was of particular concern not only to Turkey, but also to the US and the UK, which were both keen to promote Turkey&#x27;s membership of the EU. A further concern was the future of the British military bases and installations on Cyprus which were regarded as essential by both the UK and USA.

On 10–11 December, the Helsinki EU summit&#x27;s conclusions welcomed the launch of the talks in New York and declared that &quot;a political settlement will facilitate the accession of Cyprus to the European Union.&quot; This was followed by the observation that &quot;If no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations, the Council&#x27;s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition.&quot; The EU kept its options open, however, by adding: &quot;In this the Council will take account of all relevant factors.&quot;

Following the talks in New York, four more rounds of proximity talks were held in Geneva: 31 January – 8 February 24 July – 4 August, 12–26 September, and 1–10 November 2000. On 24 November, in response to the Secretary-General&#x27;s assessment of the talks (8 November 2000), which the leader of the Turkish Cypriots Rauf Denktaş rejected, Denktaş announced his withdrawal from the talks &quot;because no progress could be made until two separate states are recognized&quot;. He was supported in his decision by Turkey.

After almost a year of no talks and therefore little progress, Álvaro de Soto announced on 5 September 2001 that &quot;on behalf of the Secretary-General I have conveyed to his Excellency The Greek Cypriot Leader Glafcos Clerides and Rauf Denktaş, the Turkish Cypriot leader, an invitation to resume the search for a comprehensive settlement to the Cyprus problem under the Secretary-General&#x27;s auspices... with separate meetings of the Secretary-General with each of the two leaders on 12 September 2001 in New York.&quot; Denktaş rejected Annan&#x27;s invitation on the same day, but the visit to Cyprus in October 2001 of the President of the European Commission Romano Prodi prompted him to think again. During his visit Prodi stated that Cyprus would become an EU member with or without a settlement. Shortly thereafter Denktaş entered into correspondence with Clerides, and a meeting in the presence of Álvaro de Soto was organised in Nicosia on 4 December 2001. After the meeting, de Soto announced that the two leaders had agreed the following:

* That the United Nations Secretary-General, in the exercise of his mission of good offices, would invite the two leaders to direct talks;
* That these talks would be held in Cyprus starting in mid January 2002 on UN premises;
* That there would be no preconditions;
* That all issues would be on the table;
* That they would continue to negotiate in good faith until a comprehensive settlement was achieved;
* That nothing would be agreed until everything was agreed.

The new round of talks was held in Nicosia and ran from 16 January. In September the venue was moved to Paris, and then, in October, meetings were held in New York. After the New York meetings, Álvaro de Soto read a message from the Secretary-General to the effect that &quot;a comprehensive settlement has to be a complex, integrated, legally binding and self-executing agreement, where the rights and obligations of all concerned are clear, unambiguous, and not subject to further negotiations.&quot;

On 11 November 2002, Álvaro de Soto presented a comprehensive plan for the resolution of the Cyprus issue (Annan Plan I). Following feedback, but no negotiations between the two sides, a revised version was published on 10 December (Annan Plan II), two days before the EU Copenhagen summit. In his report to the Security Council of 1 April 2003, Kofi Annan revealed that the Copenhagen European Council Summit of 12 and 13 December 2002 was seen as a deadline:

My Special Adviser helped to guide the discussions and by mid-2002 he was making concrete suggestions to assist the parties to build bridges. I refrained however from making a written substantive input until 11 November 2002, when, no breakthrough having been achieved, and believing that no other course of action remained open if the opportunity was to be seized, I put forward a document which I believed constituted a sound basis for agreement on a comprehensive settlement. Following intensive consultations, I put forward a revised proposal on 10 December 2002, hoping to assist the parties to reach agreement in time for the Copenhagen European Council on 12 and 13 December 2002. 

According to Claire Palley, the revisions to Annan Plan I &quot;were not even-handed&quot;.
&quot;... seen overall, the changes to Annan I, made before the Copenhagen summit, began to tilt the balance further than the existing &#x27;compromises&#x27; in the &#x27;bridging proposals&#x27; even though, for the sake of &#x27;face&#x27;, some relatively minor changes were made in response to Greek-Cypriot representations.&quot; 

Intense pressure was exerted on both sides to agree to Annan Plan II before the Copenhagen Summit decision regarding Cyprus&#x27; membership application but to no avail. Nevertheless, the summit confirmed that all of Cyprus would become a member on 1 May 2004, but &quot;in the absence of a settlement, the application of the acquis to the northern part of the island shall be suspended&quot;.

Cyprus will be admitted as a new Member State to the European Union. Nevertheless, the European Council confirms its strong preference for accession to the European Union by a united Cyprus. In this context it welcomes the commitment of the Greek Cypriots and the Turkish Cypriots to continue to negotiate with the objective of concluding a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem by 28 February 2003 on the basis of the UNSG&#x27;s proposals. The European Council believes that those proposals offer a unique opportunity to reach a settlement in the coming weeks and urges the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities to seize this opportunity...

The European Council has decided that, in the absence of a settlement, the application of the acquis to the northern part of the island shall be suspended, until the Council decides unanimously otherwise, on the basis of a proposal by the Commission. Meanwhile, the Council invites the Commission, in consultation with the government of Cyprus, to consider ways of promoting economic development of the northern part of Cyprus and bringing it closer to the Union.

At the same time Turkey was told that a decision on a start date for accession negotiations would be delayed until after Cyprus had joined.

If the European Council in December 2004, on the basis of a report and a recommendation from the Commission, decides that Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria, the European Union will open accession negotiations with Turkey without delay.

===Annan Plan III===
There now followed a hasty attempt on the part of Álvaro de Soto and his team to come up with a version of the Plan which both sides could accept before 28 February 2003, a deadline which had been set by the EU so that the whole process could be completed before Cyprus&#x27;s signature of the EU accession treaty, which took place on 16 April 2003.

In his Report of 1 April 2003, Kofi Annan wrote that he believed Annan III, which was submitted to the two sides two days before the deadline, should be the final version of the plan.
During the last week in February, I visited Turkey, Greece and Cyprus, and on 26 February I formally presented a third, and what I believed should be final, version of my plan, entitled Basis for a Comprehensive Settlement of the Cyprus Problem. Prior to my visit my Special Adviser had contributed to writing the important changes I had in mind. This version contained further refinements, particularly addressing the basic requirements of the Turkish side at the same time as meeting a number of Greek Cypriot concerns in order to maintain the overall balance. I also filled in all remaining gaps in the core parts of the plan, particularly those relating to security on which Greece and Turkey had not been able to agree.

According to Claire Palley, the UN team had &quot;again made changes meeting Turkish concerns&quot;, and she cites the phrase &quot;particularly addressing the basic requirements of the Turkish side&quot; from the paragraph above as confirmation.

Having presented the &quot;final&quot; version of the Plan, Kofi Annan invited the Greek and Turkish Cypriot leaders to The Hague on 10 March, where they were to inform him whether they were prepared &quot;to sign a commitment to submit the plan for approval at separate simultaneous referendums on 30 March 2003&quot;. In the meantime the Plan had been altered with the addition of extensive &quot;Corrigenda and clarifications&quot;, and in this new form was presented to the leaders on 7 March 2003. On the Greek Cypriot side there had been a change of leadership following elections on 16 February in which Tassos Papadopoulos was elected President of the Republic of Cyprus. He received the altered Plan when he was on his way to The Hague to meet the Secretary-General.

On 10 March 2003 in The Hague, Netherlands, the UN effort collapsed when Denktaş told the Secretary-General he would not put the Annan Plan to referendum. According to the BBC, &quot;ultimately it was the Turkish Cypriot side which refused to even talk further, and which was blamed for the failure of the peace process.&quot; In the same news article Denktaş is quoted as saying: &quot;The plan was unacceptable for us. This was not a plan we would ask our people to vote for.&quot;

In his report, Kofi Annan saw this as the end of the road:
On 11 March, at 0530 hours and following negotiations with the two leaders and the guarantor Powers lasting more than 19 hours, I announced that there had been no such agreement, and at that point the process which had begun in December 1999 reached the end of the road. The office in Cyprus of my Special Adviser, which opened in advance of the direct talks, is to close during April.

===Annan Plans IV &amp; V===
As 2003 came to a close and the date for Cyprus&#x27;s accession to the EU approached, a flurry of diplomatic activity got under way to revive the negotiations. US State Department Special Cyprus Coordinator Thomas Weston met with Foreign Minister George Papandreou in Washington on 17 September 2003 and told him the USA wanted &quot;an immediate restart of talks by the two sides on the island&quot;.

At the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 12 December 2003, the Council reiterated its preference &quot;for a reunited Cyprus to join the Union on 1 May 2004&quot; and urged &quot;all parties concerned, and in particular Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot leadership, to strongly support the UN Secretary General&#x27;s efforts&quot; in an &quot;immediate resumption of the talks on the basis of his proposals&quot;.

In December Thomas Weston visited Greece, Cyprus, and Turkey; and the US President George Bush wrote to the Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis on 26 December urging him to push for a Cyprus settlement: &quot;We now have a window of opportunity to reach a settlement so that a united Cyprus joins the European Union. We must not let that window close.&quot;

Simitis responded by praising the Greek Cypriot side and pointing out that &quot;time is running out due to the Turkish side&#x27;s unwillingness to cooperate&quot;.

In the meantime parliamentary elections in Northern Cyprus (14 December 2003) had changed the political landscape. Mehmet Ali Talat leading a coalition of pro-Annan-Plan parties had narrowly defeated the incumbent Prime Minister Derviş Eroğlu. Elections had recently brought about a change of leadership in Turkey too, and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan had become prime minister on 14 March 2003. The Justice and Development Party implemented a major policy shift by supporting the peace process in the island. Erdoğan, keen to make progress on the issue of EU membership for Turkey, was &quot;not in favor of following the Cyprus policy that has been followed for the last 30 or 40 years&quot;. He criticised Denktaş, saying, &quot;This is not Mr. Denktaş&#x27;s personal business,&quot; and adding that Denktaş &quot;should pay more attention to what Turkish Cypriots think and the growing protest against his rule&quot;. However analysts have suggested that he and Denktaş were not so far apart in what they wanted from a settlement—they merely disagreed on tactics, with Erdoğan preferring that: &quot;Neither Turkey nor Turkish Cyprus should give an uncompromising impression. We should not be the side keeping away from the negotiating table.&quot;

Following intervention by Erdoğan, the outcome of post-election manoeuvring in Northern Cyprus was that Talat formed a government in alliance with the Democratic Party led by Rauf Denktaş&#x27;s son Serdar Denktaş. However Rauf Denktaş remained president, since the president is elected at separate elections.

On 4 February 2004, after having discussed matters with President Bush, Kofi Annan sent a letter to both sides in which he invited them to New York on 10 February 2004. In his letter, Annan proposed that talks resume with the aim of finalizing the plan by 31 March, and holding the referendum on 21 April. He also reserved for himself the task of completing the text of the plan if necessary:

&quot;It is clearly desirable that the text should emerge completed from the negotiations... However, should that not happen, I would, by 31 March, make any indispensable suggestions to complete the text. Naturally I would only do this with the greatest of reluctance...&quot;

At New York pressure was exerted on the two sides to grant the Secretary-General the powers of an arbitrator or mediator, but the Greek-Cypriot side would not agree. The Security Council had asked the Secretary-General to facilitate negotiations within the framework of his &quot;good offices&quot;, and any extension to that mandate should have been sought from the Security Council, where, however, any one of its members could have used a veto to deny the request.

After intense negotiations the procedure outlined in Annan&#x27;s letter was organised into phases. In Phase 1 the Cypriot parties would negotiate &quot;within the framework of my [Annan&#x27;s] mission of good offices&quot; in Nicosia from 19 February in order to produce a final text by 22 March. Negotiations were to be restricted to matters that fell &quot;within the parameters of the Plan&quot;.

In the absence of agreement, Phase 2 would involve the Secretary-General convening a meeting of the two sides, &quot;with the participation of Greece and Turkey in order to lend their collaboration, in a concentrated effort to agree on a finalized text by 29 March.&quot;

In Phase 3 the Secretary-General would use his &quot;discretion to finalize the text to be submitted to referenda on the basis of my plan&quot;.

The procedure enlarged the role foreseen for me, from completing any unfinished parts of the plan (filling in the blanks) to resolving any continuing and persistent deadlocks in the negotiations...

When Phase 1 got under way, the two Cypriot leaders, Rauf Denktaş and Tassos Papadopoulos, met nearly every day for negotiations facilitated by Álvaro de Soto. In addition, numerous technical committees and subcommittees met in parallel to work on the details. In his report the UNSG noted that Phase 1 of the effort &quot;did not produce significant progress at the political level. However, positive results were achieved at the technical level by experts from the two sides assisted by United Nations experts.&quot;

According to Claire Palley, problems and delays were created in this phase by Denktaş&#x27;s insistence on &quot;producing proposals well beyond the Plan&#x27;s parameters&quot;. For example, the Turkish side &quot;demanded massive EU derogations&quot;, and &quot;insisted on a right for all Turkish settlers to remain&quot;. James Ker-Lindsay notes that: &quot;The situation was also hindered by the bad atmosphere generated by Rauf Denktaş, who appeared determined to scupper the process by holding frequent press conferences at which he revealed as much as he could to the media.&quot;

In addition Denktaş caused a &quot;mini-crisis&quot; (so described in Annan&#x27;s Report) by declaring that he would not be attending the Phase 2 talks. In fact it was a major crisis. Technically the Phase 2 talks could not take place without the Turkish Cypriot leader there to negotiate with the Greek Cypriot leader, and Tassos Papadopoulos would have been within his rights to refuse to participate in the absence of the leader of the Turkish Cypriots. As it was he merely &quot;stressed the need for a credible interlocutor who would represent the Turkish Cypriot side&quot; and pointed out at the last Phase 1 meeting that no progress had been achieved on substantial issues.

Phase 2 was scheduled to take place on the Swiss Bürgenstock on 24 March 2004. After consultation with the Turkish government, Denktaş agreed to confer full negotiating authority on Talat the Prime Minister, and his son Serdar Denktaş, the Foreign Minister. According to Claire Palley, the Greek Cypriot side was pressured by &quot;the UN and various Powers&quot; to treat Talat and Serdar Denktaş as leaders, but in reality Rauf Denktaş remained leader of the Turkish Cypriots &quot;able at any time to withdraw his negotiating authority or to veto decisions.&quot;

At the Bürgenstock, the Turkish side wanted quadrilateral meetings (the two Cypriot delegations plus Greece and Turkey), but the Greek Cypriots objected that this had been discussed and rejected at the New York meetings. The role of the Greek and Turkish representatives was not supposed to include participating directly in the negotiations.

The first meeting for negotiations between the Cypriot sides was arranged for 24 March, but it was cancelled by de Soto at the request of Talat, two hours before it was to take place. No further formal meetings were arranged. Instead de Soto tried to get Tassos Papadopoulos to give him a prioritised wish list. The Greek Cypriots feared that if they gave such a list it would be used to justify &quot;trade-offs&quot; and thus allow for drastic changes to the plan in Phase 3 outside of already agreed parameters.

On 25 March de Soto tried to get the Cypriot parties to sign a commitment document, but it was pointed out to him that this was not part of the agreed procedure.

On 26 March Ambassador Uğur Ziyal of Turkey&#x27;s Foreign Ministry gave a list of &quot;Final Points&quot; to de Soto with the demand that the changes requested therein be made by the UN team. When the Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan arrived in Bürgenstock on 29 March, he was informed by Annan that nine of his eleven &quot;points&quot; had been agreed to by the UN team, and that the other two were virtually met. That this was the case became clear when Annan Plan IV was presented to the two sides on 29 March, and the Turkish side leaked Ziyal&#x27;s document.

The delegations were asked by Annan to provide him with their comments on Annan IV, which contained &quot;numerous amendments, including changes on core issues and reopening substantial trade-offs, previously agreed&quot; within less than 24 hours so that he could finalise the Plan. The final plan, Annan Plan V, was tabled on 31 March. It met all of Turkey&#x27;s demands. In presenting it Kofi Annan said:

Let me be clear. The choice is not between this settlement plan and some other magical or mythical solution. In reality, at this stage, the choice is between this settlement and no settlement...
This plan is fair. It is designed to work. And I believe it provides Cypriots with a secure framework for a common future. At the end of the day, of course, it does not matter what I think. It is what the people think that counts. They decide—and rightly so.

==Position of political parties==
==Referendum==
The separate simultaneous referendums held in Cyprus on 24 April 2004 resulted in the majority Greek Cypriot population voting down the UN Plan (75.38% against), whereas the minority Turkish Cypriot population voted for the Plan (64.91% in favour). The turn-out was high: 89.18% for the Greek Cypriots and 87% for the Turkish Cypriots.

The political leaders of both sides (Tassos Papadopoulos and Rauf Denktaş) had campaigned for a &#x27;no&#x27; vote, but Talat had campaigned for a &#x27;yes&#x27; vote, strongly supported by Turkey.

In exit polls 75% of the Greek Cypriots who voted &#x27;No&#x27; cited &#x27;security concerns&#x27; as the main reason for their choice. Opponents pointed to Turkey being allowed to keep a large number of troops in Cyprus after a settlement, something Greece was also allowed to do, whereas the National Guard was to be dissolved and the new Cypriot Republic demilitarised.

An academic study of the electorate&#x27;s response to the Annan Plan states that it was doomed to rejection at the polls, because it was developed through an &quot;ill-designed process of secret diplomacy&quot; which disregarded the views of the Cypriot public. The study recommends that future efforts should incorporate consultation with the public into the negotiation process.

===Results===
==After the referendum==
After the referendums, the UN welcomed the Turkish Cypriot people&#x27;s vote, and in response renewed calls to lift the embargo and restore direct economic, political and social engagement with Northern Cyprus, effective-immediately. The UN Secretary-General&#x27;s 28 May 2004 report (S/2004/437) specifically outlined Annan&#x27;s call to &quot;... eliminate unnecessary restrictions and barriers that have the effect of isolating the Turkish Cypriots and impeding their development&quot;., and urged that &quot;if the Greek Cypriots are ready to share power and prosperity with the Turkish Cypriots in a federal structure based on political equality, this needs to be demonstrated, not just by word, but by action&quot;, in response to the vast contrast between votes.

==International opinions==

===Support for the plan===

====United Nations====
*The Security Council... respects the outcome of both referenda... shares the Secretary-General&#x27;s disappointment that efforts since 1999 to reunify the island have not succeeded and regrets that an extraordinary and historic opportunity to resolve the Cyprus issue has been missed. The Security Council reiterates its strong support for an overall political settlement in Cyprus.
**Security Council Statement on Cyprus, 30 April 2004.
*I remain convinced that the plan I put forward is the only realistic basis for reunifying the island, which I believe is the sincere desire of the majority of Cypriots in both communities. I hope that before too long the Greek Cypriots will have an opportunity to consider the plan more calmly, and to judge it on its true merits.
** Kofi Annan, UN Secretary-General, Press Conference, UN Headquarters, New York, 28 April 2004.
*Together with a broad cross-section of the international community, the Secretary-General remains convinced that the settlement plan put to the two sides in today&#x27;s referenda represents a fair, viable and carefully balanced compromise—one that conforms with the long-agreed parameters for a solution and with the Security Council&#x27;s vision for a settlement, and meets the minimum requirements of all concerned.
**Statement attributable to the Spokesman of the Secretary-General Álvaro de Soto, 24 April 2004.

====European Union====
A few days before the referendum, the European Parliament passed a resolution on Cyprus on 21 April 2004 which included the following statements:
The European Parliament 
* 2. Expresses its support, and welcomes the initiative of the United Nations Secretary-General...
*3. Acknowledges – although it would unreservedly welcome a united Cyprus as a member of the European Union – the right of Cypriots to decide for themselves on the plan in a referendum without pressure from the outside and will respect such a decision, but points out that a broad, fact-based information campaign is still necessary;
*4. Considers that this final document constitutes a historic compromise which would end one of the longest-running conflicts in Europe and could serve as a shining example for handling equally difficult international issues;
*5. Considers that the final revised plan institutionalises a functional federal system of government which is able to ensure that a reunited Cyprus can speak with one voice and fully play its role in the framework of the European institutions, and calls on all parties to fulfil their obligations with honesty and openness;

Following the referendum the European Commission issued the following statement to the press:

The European Commission deeply regrets that the Greek Cypriot community did not approve the comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem, but it respects the democratic decision of the people. A unique opportunity to bring about a solution to the long-lasting Cyprus issue has been missed. The European Commission would like to warmly congratulate Turkish Cypriots for their &quot;Yes&quot; vote. This signals a clear desire of the community to resolve the island&#x27;s problem. The Commission is ready to consider ways of further promoting economic development of the northern part of Cyprus... 

====United Kingdom====
*We must now act to end the isolation of northern Cyprus. That means lifting the sanctions on trade and travel. That means also ensuring that EU funds currently available for dispersal are actually dispersed.
** Press statement of the UK Prime Minister Tony Blair 2004. 
*The UK Government believes steps should be taken as quickly as possible to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
**Deputy Foreign Minister of UK Baroness Symons 2004. 
*The Turkish Cypriots can reasonably ask that they should not be the victims of this setback; and yet it is they who are left in limbo outside the European Union. But what is now needed, surely, is to remove all discrimination against people who are, after all, citizens of the European Union and to prepare the Turkish Cypriots and their legislation and administrative practices for eventual European membership.
**Speech of UK Special Representative for Cyprus David Hannay, Baron Hannay of Chiswick, 2004. 
*I believe that it was a great shame that the Greek Cypriots voted no, and that it was a mistake to reject the Annan plan. We strongly believe that the Turkish Cypriots, who voted for a peaceful resolution of the Cyprus problem, should not be penalised because the Greek Cypriots rejected the UN settlement plans. Turkish Cypriots demonstrated their desire to be in the EU, as part of a united island... The clear majority vote by the Turkish Cypriot community at the referendum on 24 April to accept the UN Secretary General&#x27;s plan for a settlement of the Cyprus problem has not gone unnoticed. The Government of UK believes steps should be taken as quickly as possible to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.
**Speech of UK Minister for European Affairs Denis MacShane 2004.

====United States====
&quot;We have certainly been looking at steps to ease the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot side. Our ambassador in Cyprus last week announced a step with regard to extending the validity of visas for Turkish Cypriots that makes it easier for them to travel, particularly for the students who might come to the United States. So that&#x27;s one thing that we&#x27;ve announced already. We&#x27;ll be looking at other steps that we can take and making those known at the appropriate time.&quot;
* US State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher, 2004. 

&quot;We are disappointed that a majority of Greek Cypriots voted against the settlement plan. Failure of the referendums in the Greek Cypriot community is a setback to the hopes of those on the island who voted for the settlement and to the international community.&quot;
* Spokesman of the US State Department Richard Boucher in 2004 

&quot;We think that a Greek Cypriot vote against the settlement means that a unique and historic opportunity was lost. We believe the settlement was fair. It has been accepted by the Turkish Cypriot side. There will not be a better settlement. There is no other deal. There is no better deal available. And we hope that the Greek Cypriots will come to comprehend this in due time.

We have nothing but praise for the courageous Turkish Cypriots who voted for this settlement... There&#x27;s not a new negotiation plan, there&#x27;s not a renegotiation plan. This is the deal.

We do think that there was a lot of manipulation by the Greek Cypriot leaders in the run-up to the election; that the outcome was regrettable but not surprising, given those actions. I think the Europeans as well have made clear—statements by External Relations Commissioner Chris Patten, European Parliamentary President Pat Cox, Enlargement Commissioner Verheugen—that they have strong concerns in that regard as well.&quot;
* US Secretary of State Colin Powell 2004 

====Other====

 &quot;The German Government regrets that a &quot;yes&quot; vote was achieved only in the northern part of the island in today&#x27;s referenda in Cyprus. It is disappointing that the citizens in the south of the island did not seize the great opportunity for reunification which the Annan Plan offered. Unfortunately, a reunited Cyprus will not now be joining the European Union on 1 May.&quot;
* German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer&#x27;s statement of 24 April 2004 (unofficial translation) 

 &quot;France hopes that the Commission, in accordance with the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of December 2002, proposes that proper measures be taken to promote the economic development of the northern part of the island and bring it closer to the Union.&quot;
* French Foreign Ministry&#x27;s statement of 25 April 2004 

 &quot;Bangladesh expresses its deep disappointment at the rejection of the UN Plan for the reunification of Cyprus, by one community in Cyprus... Bangladesh believes that those who voted for the UN plan in Cyprus should now be given the opportunity to restore immediately their economic and trade activities internationally without any restriction.&quot;
* Bangladesh Foreign Ministry&#x27;s Press Release of 25 April 2004 

 &quot;On 1st May 2004, Cyprus will become EU member. The Turkish inhabitants of Cyprus have expressed in the referendum their will for the unification of Cyprus. They should not become hostages of the situation they will face after 1st May resulting from the refusal of the Annan plan in the south part of the island. The Czech MFA believes that the EU and the international community will find a way to help the north part of Cyprus to overcome economic and social consequences of the decades of international isolation.&quot;
* Statement by the Czech Foreign Ministry, 24 April 2004 

 &quot;We appreciate the initiative of Prime Minister Erdoğan and of the Turkish Government in order to re-unite Cyprus. Now, the EU must evaluate how it can contribute and facilitate the trade in the island and the border crossings between the two parts.&quot;
* Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, 2004 

 &quot;The Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-Waldner expressed her regret at the negative outcome of the referendum on the Greek side of Cyprus.

The fact that the referendum resulted in a positive vote on the Turkish side of Cyprus should be appropriately honored by the international community.&quot;
* Austrian Foreign Minister Ferrero-Waldner 2004 

 &quot;It is our duty to put an end to the isolation of Turkish Cypriots.&quot;
* Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC) Mr. Belkeziz 2004. 

&quot;What happened in Cyprus with the Annan plan in reality has nothing to do with the Turkish Cypriots, but the main issue was Turkey&#x27;s accession into the European Union and the pseudo-state was used as pawn.&quot;
* Eser Karakas, Professor at the Bahcesehir University in Turkey, as quoted in &quot;Haravgi&quot; (Greek Cypriot) newspaper, 27 October 2004 

&quot;If the Greek-Cypriots say &#x27;no&#x27; to the Annan plan, we will take them to a new referendum, until they say yes.&quot;
* David Hannay, Baron Hannay of Chiswick, the British architect of the Annan plan 

===Against the plan===
&quot;I consider the Annan plan to be fundamentally flawed. To put it in common language I consider that plan to be a non-starter. It is so incompatible with international law and international human rights norms that it is nothing less than shocking that the organisation would bend to political pressure and political interest on the part of my country of nationality [the USA] and Great Britain, in order to cater for the interests of a NATO partner... I think it is not salvageable, quite honestly. I think it cannot be saved, and if it were saved I think it would be a major disservice not only to the Cypriot people but a disservice to international law; because everything that we at the UN have tried to build over 60 years, the norms of international law that have emerged in international treaties, in resolutions of the Security Council, would be weakened if not made ridiculous by an arrangement that essentially ignores them, makes them irrelevant or acts completely against the letter and spirit of those treaties and resolutions.&quot;

* Alfred de Zayas, a leading expert in the field of human rights, as well as a former high-ranking United Nations official.

&quot;It appeared that the UN and the EU were bent on legitimising at least some of the consequences of the Turkish invasion of 1974, because the EU wanted to take the Cyprus issue off the table in order to facilitate negotiations on Turkey&#x27;s accession to the EU... Greek Cypriots would not have freedom of movement in their own country. In a way, the Greek Cypriots would have been ghettoised.&quot;

* Shlomo Avineri, Professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and former Director-General of Israel&#x27;s foreign ministry.

&quot;... had he [Annan] been more closely involved in the details, [he] would not have wished his name to be historically associated with such departures from international law and human rights standards. ...a significant opportunity to reach an agreed settlement was lost as a result of the conduct of the UN Secretariat, advised by the USA and the UK... The Secretariat sought to mislead the international community through the Secretary-General&#x27;s Reports and briefings it prepared, so as to pressure a small state effectively to accept the consequences of aggression by a large neighbouring state allied to two permanent members of the Security Council.&quot;

* Claire Palley, Constitutional Law adviser to Cypriot governments since 1980, in &#x27;An International Relations Debacle&#x27;, 2005

&quot;The terms of the Annan Plan would in fact have embedded instability into the heart of a Cyprus settlement and would inevitably have led to increasing friction and destabilisation. This is underlined by the provisions concerning the position of foreign nationals with effective control over key areas of governmental activities in Cyprus. Examples where non-Cypriots would (in the event of disagreement between the equal numbers of Greek and Turkish Cypriots) have effective control appeared to include the Reconciliation Commission; the Supreme Court invested with legislative and executive powers; the Central Bank; the Relocation Board; the Property Court and the organs of the Property Board. Bearing in mind the experience of the period 1960–63, the need for stability in the ordering of governmental activities is critical. Further, the foreign nationals concerned would not be democratically accountable to the people of Cyprus.&quot;

Shaw QC, UK, The Sir Robert Jennings Professor of International Law, University of Leicester.)

&quot;With regard to the referendums in Cyprus, Parliament&#x27;s primary objective should be to apply to itself the principles which it is shouting from the rooftops: observance of human rights and respect for democracy. On the first point, the Annan plan raises fundamental objections. How could the European Parliament endorse a proposed settlement which denies refugees the right to recover the property taken from them, which constitutes a permanent restriction on people&#x27;s freedom of movement and establishment, which perpetuates the presence of occupying troops and which does not provide any recourse against violations of human rights before the Strasbourg Court? On the second point, Parliament must not go along with the scandalous pressure being piled onto the Greek Cypriots by both the United States and the European Commission – and in particular by Commissioner Verheugen, one of the keenest advocates of Turkey&#x27;s accession to the European Union. The rule of democracy means that the decision of the people must be respected, especially if expressed in the most undeniable way in this respect: a referendum.&quot;

* Dominique Souchet, Member European Parliament, France.

&quot;The parties to the UN negotiations, Greece, Turkey, the (Greek) Cypriot government and the (still internationally unrecognized) Turkish Cypriot administration met in April at Bürgenstock in Switzerland, having allowed Kofi Annan in advance to make his own arbitration decisions on any unresolved issues when the negotiations ended; in their final stages a last minute tranche of extra demands were made by the Turkish military—which the Turkish Cypriots had not asked for and did not want. Urged on by the EU and the US, Annan accepted them all—including the proposal that Turkish troops remain in the island in perpetuity. This concession was calculated to smooth the path of Turkey towards EU membership (the deadline for negotiation on which has been set for the end of 2004) and to demonise the Greek Cypriots as scapegoats if a political solution did not materialise. In the short term this part of the plot has worked. The Turkish Cypriot &quot;yes&quot; and the Greek Cypriot &quot;no&quot; in the subsequent referenda generated carefully choreographed accusations against the Greek Cypriots of &quot;democratic irresponsibility&quot;, not wanting the island&#x27;s reunification and jeopardising Turkey&#x27;s EU membership.&quot;

* Christopher Price, former Labour politician in the United Kingdom.

&quot;The final version of the plan isn&#x27;t a package on which the parties ever agreed. It is a mass of coercions written by aides to the UN secretary-general saying, &#x27;this meets you halfway&#x27; and then communicated to the parties. Secondly, there&#x27;s no precedent in international law of bringing such a blueprint to a referendum. A referendum should be based on a definite text prepared by an authority, or it should be a text on which the parties are agreed so that the people know that the agreement will be accepted if they vote in its favor. None of these conditions now exists. The UN General Secretariat, whose authority is controversial, exercised its &#x27;goodwill mission&#x27; [good offices mission] granted by the Security Council and made the parties accept it through threats and deception. The text is devoid of compromise. Thirdly, setting aside judicial disagreements on various issues, this &#x27;map of zones&#x27; is a map being presented to those who&#x27;ll live there without any discussion.&quot;

== Causes of the outcome ==
===Reasons for rejection as explained by the Greek Cypriots===

&quot;As summarised by &quot;The Case Against the Annan Plan&quot;, from Coufoudakis and Kyriakides and the Letter by the President of the Republic, Mr Tassos Papadopoulos, to the U.N. Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan dated 7 June 2004&quot;
* The Turkish Cypriot constituent state would have been integrated to Turkey, making the United Cyprus Republic answerable to Turkey.
* Turkey was granted rights to interfere with the Treaty between Egypt and the Republic of Cyprus on the Delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone. Cyprus&#x27; rights to its Continental Shelf in the south would have also been answerable to Turkey.
* Turkey was granted the right of stationing Turkish troops on the island of Cyprus perpetually.
* Cyprus is 77% Greek and 18% Turkish. 5% of the population are other ethnic group. (2001) The Annan Plan mandates equal representation of Greeks and Turks in the proposed Senate and in the Supreme court, giving 50–50 representation to the two communities and therefore disproportionate representation to the Turks.
* The plan created a confederation even though it utilised the term &quot;federation&quot; because there was no hierarchy of laws, while central authority emanated from the so-called component states. The Supreme court composed of equal numbers of Greek Cypriot (77% of population) and Turkish Cypriot judges (18% of population), plus three foreign judges; thus foreigners would cast deciding votes.
* The Plan did not include a settlement regarding the repatriation of Turkish settlers living on Greek Cypriot owned land in Northern Cyprus, while after 19 years, the possibility of abolishing the derogation of 5% of Greeks and Turkish citizens who could settle in Cyprus, is obvious, and the danger of a permanent mass settling of Cyprus by Turkey is visible.
* Nearly all the Turkish settlers would be granted citizenship or residence rights leading to citizenship. The central government would have limited control towards future Turkish immigration. Those settlers opting to return to Turkey would be compensated by Cyprus and Greek Cypriots. Even though Turkey systematically brought in the settlers to alter the demography of the island, it had no responsibility for their Repatriation.
* The Plan simply disregarded the plain language and clear meaning of the Geneva Convention of 1949, section III, article 49, which prohibits colonisation by an occupying power. Article 49 states in its last paragraph: &quot;The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies.&quot;
* The Plan did not deal in full with the issue of demilitarisation of the legally invalid &#x27;TRNC&#x27;, and Greek Cypriots felt they had no reason to believe Turkish promises concerning the withdrawal of troops.
* Cyprus would be excluded from the European Common Defense and Foreign Policy, while Turkish troops would remain in Cyprus even after the accession of Turkey to the EU with intervention rights, (a military invasion – occasionally used euphemistically), in the future Greek Cypriot component state.
* Many Greek Cypriots interpreted the Right of Return policy as seriously flawed, meaning only 20% of Greek Cypriot refugees would be able to return over a time frame of 25 years, whereas Turkish Cypriots would have had full right of return. The plan denied to all Cypriots rights enjoyed by all other EU citizens (right of free movement and residence, the right to apply to work in any position, including national civil services, the right to vote).
* Turkish Cypriots would have gained all their requested demands in the 24 hours following the referendum, had the plan been accepted. Greek Cypriot demands, however, were relegated to the long term – as well as being dependent on the good will of Turkey to fulfill its obligations.
* The return of the Turkish occupied land will take place in the period between three and a half months and three and a half years from the moment the solution is signed with no guarantees whatsoever that this shall be implemented. The Cypriot-Greek proposal of placing these areas under the control of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus and not the Turkish Army has been rejected.
* The Plan did not address the issue of the British Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) on the island, although parts of the SBAs would be transferred to the governments of the two constituent states.
* The British were granted rights to unilaterally define the continental shelf and territorial waters along two base areas and to claim potential mineral rights. Under the 1959–1960 Zürich and London Agreements, Britain did not have such rights (see the 2nd annex to the Additional Protocol to the 1959 Treaty of Establishment).
* The plan absolved Turkey of all responsibility for its invasion of Cyprus and its murders, rapes, destruction of property and churches, looting and forcing approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots from their homes and property. The Cyprus government filed applications to the European Commission on Human rights on 17 September 1974 and on 21 March 1975. The Commission issued its report on the charges made in the two applications on 10 July 1976. In it the Commission found Turkey guilty of violating the following articles of the European Convention on Human Rights:

# Article 2 – by the killing of innocent civilians committed on a substantial scale;
# Article 3 – by the rape of women of all ages from 12 to 71;
# Article 3 – by inhuman treatment of prisoners and persons detained;
# Article 5 – by deprivation of liberty with regard to detainees and missing persons – a continuing violation;
# Article 8 – by displacement of persons creating more than 180,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, and be refusing to allow the refugees to return to their homes.

* The plan failed to provide payment by Turkey:

# for the lives of innocent civilians killed by the Turkish army;
# for the victims of rape by the Turkish army;
# for the vast destruction of property and churches by the Turkish army; and
# for the substantial looting by the Turkish army.

* The Plan subverted the property rights of the Greek Cypriots and other legal owners of property in the occupied area:
** by prohibiting recourse to European courts on property issues;
** by withdrawing all pending cases at the European Court of Human Rights and transferring them to local courts;
** by allowing Turkish Cypriots and illegal mainland Turk settlers/colonists to keep Greek Cypriot homes and property they were illegally given following Turkey&#x27;s invasion of Cyprus and not having to reimburse the rightful owners of the property for 30 years of illegal use;
** by a highly complicated, ambiguous and uncertain regime for resolving property issues and which is based on the principle that real property owners can ultimately be forced to give up their property rights which would violate the European Convention on Human Rights and international law. The Greek Cypriot property owners would have to be reimbursed by the federal treasury which would be funded overwhelmingly by the Greek Cypriots, meaning that Greek Cypriots would be reimbursing themselves.
* The Plan would have the effect of protecting those British citizens who illegally bought Greek Cypriot property from settlers or persons who are not owners; in the occupied north of Cyprus. They would, in effect, not be held responsible for their illegal action.
* The cost of economic reunification would be borne by the Greek Cypriots. The reunification cost has been estimated to be close to $20b.
* Following the Annan 5 plan, the Greek Cypriots would not have been allowed to make up more than 6% of the population in any single village in the Turkish-controlled areas in the north thus they would have been prevented from setting up their own schools for their children and would not have even been able to give birth once this quota was reached.
* The agreement places time restrictions in the right of free, permanent installation of Greek Cypriots back to their homes and properties in them to be Turkish Cypriot State, which constitutes a deviation from the European Union practices. Those Greek Cypriot refugees that would return to their homes in regions under Turkish Cypriot administration would have no local civil rights, because the political representatives of Turkish Cypriot State would be elected only from Turkish Cypriots.
* The functional weaknesses of the Plan endanger, inter alia, the smooth activity and participation of Cyprus, with one voice, in the European Union. While the Greek Cypriots have with many sacrifices achieved Cyprus accession to the European Union, the Greek Cypriots could very easily be led to the &quot;neutralization&quot; of the accession until the adoption of all necessary federal and regional legal measures or the loss of the benefits of the accession or the facing of obstacles in Cyprus participation in the Economic and Monetary Union and other European institutions.
* The economy of Cyprus would have been separate with the plan. There will be no common monetary policy, fiscal policy and no investments by Greek Cypriot businesses shall be allowed in the Turkish Cypriot constituent state.
* Many Greek-Cypriots felt that the demand that the Cyprus issue be resolved before Cyprus&#x27; entry to the EU was so that the reunification would not have to contain elements of European law which were incompatible with certain provisions in the Annan Plan. This was further backed up by many who demanded the EU accept all derogations even if they violate European Court Decisions, European law and UN Security Council Resolutions. Both Romano Prodi and Günter Verheugen repeatedly indicated that any such derogations should only be for a short period of time and should not violate any European regulations.

<doc id="612672" wikidata="Q6607947" url="?curid=612672" title="List of bishops in the Church of England">
<text>The active bishops of the Church of England are usually either diocesan bishops or suffragan bishops. Several also hold portfolios of national responsibility, either as spokesperson bishops for the Church of England or as Lords Spiritual in the House of Lords.

==Diocesan bishops==
As there are 42 dioceses of the Church of England, there are 42 bishops diocesan (including vacancies). Of the 42: both archbishops and the Bishops of London, of Durham and of Winchester, sit in the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual &quot;ex officio&quot;; a further 21 sit there by seniority (of whom five had their seniority accelerated); the Bishop of Sodor and Man sits &quot;ex officio&quot; in the Legislative Council of the Isle of Man and also in Tynwald Court; fourteen diocesans are not currently Lords Spiritual; and the Bishop in Europe is ineligible to be a Lord Spiritual.
===Lords Spiritual &quot;ex officio&quot;===
===Lords Spiritual by virtue of seniority of service===
Until 2015, the 21 longest-serving among the remaining diocesan bishops were eligible to sit in the House of Lords as Lords Spiritual. Since women became eligible as bishops in 2015, female diocesan bishops take precedence over male ones whenever a new vacancy in the Lords arises, in accordance with the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015 (originally in force until 17 May 2025, extended in 2025 by five more years until 18 May 2030).

===Other diocesan bishops===
===Acting diocesan bishops===
:&quot;Acting diocesan bishops, properly called episcopal commissaries, are referred to by a wide variety of informal titles. For simplicity, this article refers only to the Acting Bishop of Somewhere.&quot;
:&quot;There is no acting diocesan bishop during the Canterbury vacancy because the Bishop of Dover is &quot;de facto&quot; diocesan anyway.&quot;
==Suffragan bishops==
, there are 73 bishops suffragan. Of the 73: one, the Bishop of Dover, acts as a diocesan bishop; one, the Bishop of Islington, has a national role (though often focused in London); five bishops provide &quot;Alternative Episcopal Oversight&quot; (to parishes who reject the presbyteral and/or episcopal ministry of women); 20 are area bishops; and the remaining 46 are deployed in suffragan roles across their diocese (or have informal portfolios or geographical responsibility).
==Other bishops==
, there are sixteen people in active ministry (i.e. not retired) in the Church of England who are in episcopal orders but not in episcopal posts in the Church of England.

<doc id="612674" wikidata="Q7786442" url="?curid=612674" title="This Is SportsCenter">
<text>This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot; was a series of comical television commercials that debuted in 1995 and was run by ESPN to promote their &quot;SportsCenter&quot; sports news show, based on the show&#x27;s opening tagline. The ads were presented in a deadpan, mockumentary style, lampooning various aspects of sports, and sports broadcasting.

The New York office of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, of Portland, Oregon, wrote and produced the commercials until 2017, with ESPN taking production in-house since 2018. In 2022, ESPN&#x27;s new creative partner, Arts &amp; Letters, announced that it would revive the campaign in the beginning of 2023. On December 2, 2024, ESPN announced that it would be discontinuing the &quot;This is SportsCenter&quot; campaign after 30 years. The new campaign, entitled &quot;My Life, My Team&quot; will debut on ESPN&#x27;s family of networks on December 30, 2024.

A few of the ads are available for free on iTunes while many ads are available for viewing through the official ESPN YouTube channel.

==Guest appearances by sports figures==
A notable feature of the commercials is the seeming ubiquity of famous athletes on the ESPN campus. Some are even depicted doing menial, everyday tasks, usually while wearing their game uniforms. Athletes often have their idiosyncrasies parodied—for example, gymnast Kerri Strug being carried around ESPN headquarters because of her famous ankle injury.

==List of This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot; spots==

===1994===
* In one of the earliest &quot;This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; commercials, Roger Clemens and Cam Neely drive around asking people, to no avail, where they can locate &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. After a very long search they finally arrive only to find out it has been closed for Chris Berman&#x27;s birthday.

===1995===
* In a 1995 commercial Dan Patrick interviews Keith Olbermann, who is performing surgery on Colts quarterback Jim Harbaugh, even though he is still awake; Harbaugh pointedly asks, &quot;Aren&#x27;t I supposed to be asleep?&quot; just before the surgery appears to go south. Bob Ley suggests this incident may have violated journalistic ethics.
* In a 1995 commercial, WWF wrestlers King Kong Bundy, Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash, and The Undertaker invade the studio, demanding reasons as to why professional wrestling highlights are not being shown on ESPN.

===1996===
* In a 1996 commercial, an ESPN producer discusses a fictional trade between &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and the soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, wherein Andrew Shue and Charley Steiner switch jobs; the ad features Shue at the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; desk discussing a working interview with NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, then cuts to the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; set where Steiner is cleaning the pool and enthusiastically asks one of the female characters, Sydney Andrews played by actress Laura Leighton, if she wants to rub suntan lotion on his back.
* In a 1996 commercial, Detroit Red Wings legend Gordie Howe is reminiscing with Keith Olbermann and demonstrating stick and body checks while Olbermann is trying to work.
* Olympic gymnast Kerri Strug was featured in two commercials. In the first, she is carried around the ESPN offices, being handed off from person to person, finally being carried off by Michigan State mascot Sparty. In the second, Strug is talking incessantly while still being carried around, and no one is interested in holding her anymore.
* Former U.S. Senator and basketball player with the Princeton Tigers, New York Knicks, and the U.S. Olympic Team Bill Bradley is interviewed for a job by Keith Olbermann and Bob Ley, who skeptically question his qualifications to work at &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

===1997===
* In a 1997 commercial Kenny Mayne and Stuart Scott run a training camp for rookies to teach them about having (what turns out to be) an arrogant attitude, yelling at a young Kobe Bryant and Keyshawn Johnson to yell out &quot;I&#x27;m the man.&quot; Both turn in poor efforts.

===1999===
* In a 1999 commercial aired in the midst of the Y2K fears, when the studio&#x27;s electricity goes out (due to Y2K tests), amidst the ensuing mayhemwhich includes Mark McGwire smashing a computer with his batCharley Steiner walks away, wearing face paint and a necktie as a headband, holding a lantern and screaming, “Follow me! Follow me to freedom!”
* In the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; studios, Rich Eisen is chatting with Bobby Labonte about his hair, when Labonte notices someone doing donuts in his #18 Interstate Batteries Pontiac in the parking lot. Labonte runs down to the lot to find the Georgetown Hoyas mascot, Jack the Bulldog, driving the car and screams at him. Eisen then pays off the mascot for the prank.

===2000===
* At the ESPN offices, Stuart Scott bumps into Tiger Woods, who asks if they&#x27;re still on for lunch; Scott tells Tiger to meet him in the lobby at 12:30. Tiger walks away then followed by the huge crowd which usually follows him at any golf tournament he plays at. A shorter version of this ad sees Woods decline an invitation to sponsor Scott in a race, minus the crowd.
* The power goes out late at night at the ESPN studios; Dan Patrick goes backstage to find the cause of the power outage: apparently Lance Armstrong has taken a break from riding his bicycle connected to a generator.

===2002===
* A 2002 ad shows Dan Patrick and Stone Cold Steve Austin in the break room late at night, with Austin studying and being unable to stay awake. Patrick helps to wake Austin up with a chair shot to the back. Austin asks for one more, which Patrick obliges to do, and Austin thanks him and resumes his studying.

===2005===
* A 2005 ad included Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger saving people from the ESPN building while the fire alarm is ringing. Stuart Scott is talking outside the building with Scott Van Pelt asking &quot;Does he know this is a drill?&quot;

===2006===
* In 2006, a commercial aired which showed Danica Patrick&#x27;s race car being towed from a parking spot, presumably outside &quot;SportsCenter&quot; studios, which was reserved for &quot;D. Patrick&quot;. Danica runs outside after her car, only to run into Dan Patrick, one of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;″s anchors. Some humorous debate over whose parking spot it really was follows.
* A 2006 ad features the Manning family taking a tour of the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; studio.

In the commercial, a confused Van Pelt looks to Rollins for guidance in his &quot;poor performances&quot; which include talking to the camera with his head down on his desk, spinning on his chair, randomly flapping his arm, and elevating his head above the camera. The commercial ends with the phrase &quot;The great ones always figure it out&quot; with Jimmy Rollins clearly frustrated at Van Pelt&#x27;s videos.

===2024===
* A 2024 ad features golfer Jon Rahm telling the cafeteria cashier that he and his caddy get a seat in the back much to anchors John Buccigross and Kevin Connors&#x27; dismay. Rahm also appears in another spot where he and Steve Levy encounter Florida Gators mascot Albert in the break room; there is also a Spanish version of the latter ad in which Rahm discusses with Mexican anchor John Sutcliffe how to play a ball near Albert the Gator before coming to the agreement that Rahm should take a drop. 
* A 2024 ad features Houston Astros shortstop Jeremy Pena being late for his meeting.
* A 2024 ad features Indiana Fever center Aliyah Boston, Las Vegas Aces center A&#x27;ja Wilson and Texas Rangers mascot the Rangers Captain dribbling in the lobby when they invite anchor Kevin Negandhi to play with them.
* A 2024 ad features swimmer Katie Ledecky and anchor Nicole Briscoe about to get some lunch in the cafeteria when they see that Miami Marlins mascot Billy the Marlin is guarding the buffet area. Ledecky also appears in another spot where she and anchor Kevin Connors are in the storage room looking for Ledecky&#x27;s lost swim goggles.
* A 2024 spot features gymnast Simone Biles giving anchor Jay Harris some motivation tips on the set.
* A 2024 spot features Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Miami Dolphins mascot T.D., Miami Marlins mascot Billy the Marlin, Vancouver Canucks mascot Fin and San Jose Sharks mascot S.J. Sharkie invading a typical SportsCenter preshow meeting that Norby Williamson is conducting which also includes anchors Kevin Connors, Molly Qerim, Sage Steele and Gary Striewski. After Tagovailoa and the mascots take the water bottles, Striewski asks Connors, &quot;What are we gonna do for water?&quot; Connors responds, &quot;The drinking fountain after the meeting, I guess.&quot;
* A 2024 ad features South Carolina Gamecocks women&#x27;s basketball coach Dawn Staley and anchor Jay Harris having a conversation about the differences between men&#x27;s basketball and women&#x27;s basketball. Staley then manages to slap Harris on the backside as Harris groans, &quot;Oh, women.&quot;
* A 2024 ad features anchors Jay Harris and David Lloyd checking out Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts and New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone&#x27;s empty cubicles while the managers are in Los Angeles for the World Series. Harris then picks up a seemingly innocent baseball but is doused with chocolate syrup coming out of the baseball, embarrassing himself in the process.

==Sports practices==
Many commercials in the series have derived their humor from parodying conventional professional sports practices, by applying them to working for &quot;SportsCenter&quot;:

* A spot from the early 2000s had Michelle Kwan sitting on a couch just off-set with Dan Patrick and Rich Eisen seeing their ratings, and finding out they&#x27;re not popular in Texas. The ad was a parody of figure skaters receiving their scores from the kiss and cry area.
* One ad has former anchor Rich Eisen being &quot;sent down to the minors&quot; (in his case, working for a high-school TV service, where two students asked him to buy them some beer, a request he declined to honor).
* San Diego Padres closer Trevor Hoffman replaces anchor Kenny Mayne for the show&#x27;s &quot;Did You Know?&quot; segment, similar to relieving the starting pitcher in a baseball game.
* The network drafting a &quot;can&#x27;t-miss&quot; anchor prospect out of high school, only to see him flame out on the job (&quot;Jimmy Key, what is he 45? &quot;I&quot; could hit him!&quot;) and ESPN discovering that &quot;he just came out too soon&quot;, alluding to how some basketball players leave school early and &quot;flame out&quot;.
* John Buccigross wearing the &quot;anchor-cam&quot;, a parody of MLB catchers wearing a &quot;catcher-cam&quot; during ESPN and FOX&#x27;s MLB telecasts.
* Charley Steiner being &quot;traded&quot; to &quot;Melrose Place&quot; in exchange for Andrew Shue.
* One rather infamous spot is the making of the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; swimsuit calendar, featuring Bill Pidto, Stuart Scott and Linda Cohn in various states of revealing swimwear.
* One ad featured Stuart Scott recalling various anchors&#x27; &quot;Perfect Shows&quot; (&quot;Bob Ley had his in &#x27;89, Steiner in &#x27;91&quot;), and how Dan Patrick &quot;had one going last season&quot;. It then cuts to the set to show the various crew members and co-anchor Kenny Mayne refusing to speak or even make eye-contact with Patrick during commercial breaks, similar to how in baseball it is considered bad luck to talk in the dugout to a pitcher who takes a no-hitter or perfect game into the late innings. Patrick ultimately slips up though, declaring on air &quot;That of course is the kind of thing that can&#x27;t never happen in a playoff race&quot;, and he is crushed as an &quot;umpire&quot; in the control booth declares he has used a double negative. Scott wraps up the spot by saying &quot;In the end, he just let it get away from him.&quot;
* A parody of post-game interviewing finds a dejected Kenny Mayne and an upbeat Dan Patrick asked about their performances in that evening&#x27;s broadcast in &quot;locker room&quot; interviews.
* The carpet in the ESPN headquarters is replaced with grass to prevent injuries, a parody of the controversy over injuries sustained by football players competing on AstroTurf (in the ad, ESPN workers are shown tripping on the carpet). The anchors have to yell over the sound of the lawn mower cutting the grass in the studio.
* One spot from the mid-90s had &quot;SportsCenter&quot; being &#x27;relocated&#x27;, lampooning the trend of team owners threatening city (and in some cases state) governments with relocation to get what they want. In the ad, Hair Club for Men founder Sy Sperling is depicted as the owner of &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, announcing at a press conference he is relocating to &quot;the city of the future - Bristol, CT.&quot; He raves about free parking, more luxury boxes, and the availability of high-quality fruits and vegetables. Sperling wraps up the ad by saying, &quot;I&#x27;d have loved to stay in California, but those bastards in Sacramento low-balled me&quot;, seeming to spoof the recent departure of both the Raiders and Rams from Los Angeles, both because of their unsatisfactory stadiums. In reality, &quot;SportsCenter&quot; was always based in Bristol since the show&#x27;s inception in 1979.
* In a 1997 ad, Dan Patrick and Kenny Mayne are shown signing off a typical &quot;SportsCenter&quot; broadcast, and are then given sombreros, and they begin broadcasting the Spanish version of &quot;SportsCenter&quot; (with a mariachi version of the show&#x27;s theme). While Bob Ley explains that they redo the show for overseas markets (&quot;Same highlights, same anchors, different dialects&quot;), they are also shown giving Russian and German versions a try, replete with national costumes, and the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; theme redone for those cultures.
* In a recent ad, Scott Van Pelt asks spelling bee champion David Tidmarsh to help him by spelling &quot;Pujols&quot;. In true spelling bee tradition, Tidmarsh asks for the team (St. Louis Cardinals), country of origin (Dominican Republic), and for the word to be used in a sentence (&quot;Pujols homered to win the game.&quot;), then slowly spells the word while Van Pelt cuts him off, saying &quot;I found it online, got it.&quot;
* A 2005 ad begins with John Anderson commenting that Scott Van Pelt had been on a run of unbelievable shows, accompanied by footage of Van Pelt using numerous &quot;big-syllable&quot; words (&quot;A-Rod exhibits inordinate aptitude in spheroidical aviation!&quot;); Anderson then sadly reveals that Scott had been using &quot;performance enhancers&quot;, showing Van Pelt&#x27;s cubicle being raided by FBI agents who discover a thesaurus. Van Pelt attempts to flee and is wrestled to the ground by the agents, shouting out, &quot;Unhand me, you rapscallion!&quot; The ad spoofed the recent steroid controversy in baseball surrounding players such as Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi, with a dejected Anderson concluding, &quot;We gotta win back a lot of trust.&quot;
* A 2006 ad shows Scott Van Pelt and Stuart Scott jumping and stretching before a show, similar to what NBA players do before games. The ad ends with both men easily taking off their &quot;warm-up suits&quot; revealing their show suits underneath.
* In one ad Stuart Scott discusses &quot;rain delays&quot; and says that every so often there is one. Then they cut to a show where a leak from a pipe above the stage causes a grounds crew to come out and lay a tarp on the set. The anchors and grounds crew members are seen calling loved ones and chewing gum similarly to baseball players and fans. Scott says &quot;You just hope it lets up.&quot;
* A 2007 ad features how a &quot;SportsCenter&quot; video game is made (this ad is a take on the sports video game craze).
* A 2008 ad features a coin toss between anchors Jay Harris and Brian Kenny to determine who will start the show.
* A 2008 ad features how &quot;SportsCenter&quot; viewers can decide which highlights to air via text messaging. They can choose one of the three options: have John Anderson read the highlights, have Jay Harris read the highlights or have a roller-skating cockatoo dunk a basketball. In the end, they chose the latter.
* A 2008 ad has anchors Steve Levy and John Anderson answering phone calls from viewers in a parody of sports call-in shows (including ESPN Radio).
* A 2008 ad has Scott Van Pelt and Neil Everett being &quot;represented&quot; by Drew Rosenhaus at the cafeteria. Rosenhaus negotiates the cost of their lunches from $23.50 down to $15, using many familiar tactics of player contract negotiation (For example: &quot;What if I guarantee we&#x27;ll be back tomorrow and give you an option for Friday?&quot;) Rosenhaus also offers to throw in incentives for extra chocolate pudding, with Van Pelt quickly piping up, &quot;I want sprinkles.&quot;
* Van Pelt appeared in another sports agent spoof alongside &quot;megaagent&quot; Scott Boras. In the ad, Boras (known throughout baseball for his hardline negotiating tactics) represents Van Pelt, demanding (among other things) that the company name a sandwich after him in the cafeteria since Scott &quot;uses more five-syllable words than any other anchor&quot;. When Boras demands an incentive clause allowing Scott to wear a Snuggie on-air for a year should he win an Emmy Award, the ESPN execs agree to &quot;everything but the Snuggie&quot;, to which a stone-faced Boras replies, &quot;We&#x27;re gonna need the Snuggie.&quot;
* A recent ad features John Anderson being taken in a company expansion draft by ESPN Deportes. On a show, all he manages is &quot;Hola!&quot;
* A 2008 ad features the pit crews of Jeff Gordon and Jimmie Johnson helping anchors Scott Van Pelt and Neil Everett getting ready for the next segment during the commercial.
* A 2008 ad has anchor John Buccigross getting the ax and rallying for his job in a shopping center in a parody of coaches and managers getting fired.
* A 2007 ad has Jimmie Johnson using a pickaxe to slowly destroy a speed bump in the ESPN parking lot, as you see his race car near him, obviously too low to pass the bumps.
* A 2009 ad featured anchor John Anderson discussing that &quot;SportsCenter&quot; does do halftime shows, but unfortunately when the announcer introduces the hip-hop group the Jabbawockeez, many ESPN employees including anchors Brian Kenny and John Buccigross get out of the studio believing that the dance team looked like ghosts.
* A 2009 ad has anchor Jay Harris giving fellow anchor Brian Kenny a pep talk in the digital center, telling him &quot;to concentrate&quot;.
* A 2010 ad has anchor Stuart Scott discussing how &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors get along despite having &quot;different&quot; personalities.
* A 2010 ad features various anchors doing charitable work throughout Bristol, Connecticut.
* A 2011 ad features various &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors capitalizing on the Twitter craze.

==Sports mascots==
Sports mascots and cheerleaders are usually present in most ads, implying they work behind the scenes at ESPN. They are often seen casually milling around in the background, but occasionally they take on an active role:

* In a 2003 ad, when the show ends, everyone rushes out of the studio, creating a massive traffic jam. It then shows Mr. Met and Lady Met driving home on the freeway (with the Met children in the back), with Lady Met subtitled as saying they were glad to get out early. The New York Mets theme song, &quot;Meet the Mets&quot;, is on their car radio. (A shorter version with just the Mets family has Lady Met accusing Mr. Met of making eyes at one of the female ESPN sportscasters.)
** Mr. Met subsequently would take a lead role in a 2009 ad in which he is talking with Stuart Scott at a microwave. When Josh Hamilton shows up to use the microwave, Mr. Met angrily gestures at him and walks away. Hamilton is confused until Scott reveals that some of the balls Hamilton hit in the 2008 Home Run Derby were his cousins.
* Boston University&#x27;s mascot, Rhett, appears in two &quot;on-campus&quot; spots in 2001. In one, he frustrates ESPN&#x27;s doctor, who is trying to find his pulse. In the other, he joins Curt Schilling, Jesper Parnevik, Kenny Mayne, Stuart Scott, Linda Cohn, and others in spreading &quot;the wave&quot; around Bristol.
* Wake Forest University&#x27;s mascot, the Demon Deacon, appears in a commercial featuring David Wright of the New York Mets, wherein Wright, John Anderson, and Neil Everett lampoon the baseball practice of covering the mouth with the glove while speaking on the field so that the opposing team cannot read the speaker&#x27;s lips — they discuss where they are to meet for a party later that evening while covering their mouths, Wright with his glove, the anchors with folders.
* Billy the Marlin, the Florida Marlins&#x27; mascot, which always has an open mouth, is startled to find his &quot;girlfriend,&quot; Andrea Kremer, kissing another &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchor.
* The San Diego Chicken, who is seen pulling practical jokes all over the ESPN building; it is revealed at the end of the commercial that inside the costume was Pete Sampras, playing against his image as being and .
* Syracuse University&#x27;s Otto the Orange, who gets punched by Charley Steiner after Steiner is described as being a boxing enthusiast.
* Sparty, the Michigan State Spartans&#x27; mascot, receives the final handoff of gymnast Kerri Strug as she is carried around the studio. The image is an allusion to US gymnastics coach Béla Károlyi carrying the injured Strug to accept her team gold medal at the 1996 Olympics.
* Steve Irwin (&quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot;) wrestled with Albert E. Gator when he spotted the Florida Gators mascot stepping out of an elevator.
* Big Red, the mascot of Western Kentucky University, is confused over which restroom to use until Rich Eisen instructs it to &quot;use the woods out back.&quot;
* Stuart Scott gets food for the Milwaukee Brewers Racing Sausages. The Hot Dog chooses a hot dog, which causes Scott to remark &quot;That&#x27;s sick&quot;, then the Italian Sausage asks for pizza; the Sausages also appear in a 2007 spot where they chase the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; anchors down the halls of the ESPN studios, parodying Pamplona&#x27;s Running of the Bulls.
* Sam the Minuteman, the mascot for the UMass Minutemen, knocks a tennis ball away from Andy Roddick as Roddick bounces it off his racket into the air in a waiting room.
* The Stanford Tree stares at anchor John Anderson after he throws a crumpled up piece of paper in the garbage can. Anderson is guilted into taking the paper out of the garbage and puts it into the recycling bin. The Tree makes another appearance in another ad where Jason Heyward describes to several anchors, in grisly detail, how a tree is cut into making his bat, which causes the Tree to faint.
* The Boston Red Sox mascot, Wally the Green Monster, reacts in shock after seeing Red Sox star David Ortiz wearing a New York Yankees hat. Ortiz was really just trying to break in the hat for Yankees catcher Jorge Posada.
* Rutgers University&#x27;s Scarlet Knight appears in the Y2K episode chasing and then stomping on the University of Connecticut Husky, who was attempting to steal trophies in the chaos.
* In a 2002 ad, anchors Scott Van Pelt and Rich Eisen are saying some nonsensical words; as it turns out, it is none other than Boston Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster controlling the teleprompter until he is stopped by a producer. It is also the only &quot;SportsCenter&quot; commercial where the closing graphic &quot;This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; does not appear at the end of the commercial. Instead it is replaced by &quot;This is Spilifantrr&quot;, a take on the spot.
* The Blue Blob, a mascot of Xavier University, is shown eating Jim Kelly&#x27;s NFL Hall of Fame jacket after beating him in rock paper scissors. Kelly then asks for best 2 out of 3, the Blue Blob declines.
* Brutus Buckeye, mascot for the Ohio State University, appears in the background performing Richard Simmons&#x27; conditioning exercises. He falls down in the end.
* A 2008 ad features the New York Jets Flight Crew asking anchor Chris McKendry advice on romantic relationships with players.
* A 2008 ad features former NASCAR driver and ESPN NASCAR analyst Rusty Wallace eating lunch with the University of Delaware mascot YoUDee, but when Wallace cannot eat his entire lunch, he gives the rest of his lunch to YoUDee and the mascot is able to swallow the food in one gulp.
* A 2008 ad has the University of Kansas mascot Big Jay working at the answering service when John Anderson&#x27;s voice is heard on the answering machine.
* A 2008 ad has the New Jersey Devils mascot NJ Devil on an elevator when Jay Harris asks: &quot;Goin&#x27; up?&quot; and the Devil shakes his head, implying the Devil is using the elevator to descend to Hell. Harris then steps out of the elevator.
* A 2009 ad shows the thermostat in the office with a sign saying &quot;Do Not Touch&quot;. The Pittsburgh Penguins&#x27; mascot, Iceburgh comes over and turns the temperature down. As the &quot;This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; title is shown, NJ Devil comes over to turn the temperature back up.
* A 2009 ad features the UMass mascot, Sam the Minuteman, in a commercial about Brett Favre&#x27;s comeback. The segment begins with Josh Elliot finding out Favre is coming back and words spreads from the copy room to the mail room to Brian Kenny and finally to Jay Harris, who alerts Sam the Minuteman of the comeback. Sam puts two lanterns in the window as Scott Van Pelt and Stuart Scott walk by, trying to figure out if it was one lantern or two to signify a comeback.
* A 2009 ad features the Oregon Duck in the office typing on the computer, the duck stops typing as he hears real ducks quacking from a pond outside the office. The mascot then leans back in his chair and lets out a sigh as the &quot;This is &quot;SportsCenter&quot;&quot; title is shown.
* In a 2010 ad, anchor Hannah Storm is seen washing her hands when the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; mascot, Bernie Brewer enters the ladies&#x27; room. Storm tells the mascot to use the men&#x27;s restroom.
* A 2010 ad features the Tennessee Volunteers mascot Smokey being told by Vince Doria not to bring animals to the studio. A dejected costumed Smokey then walks away in disgust.
* A 2010 ad features Josh Elliott coming out of the studio. While on his way to his car, he sees the Chicago White Sox mascot Southpaw and asks him if he wants a ride. Southpaw declines the offer.
* A 2010 ad features Steve Levy drinking water out of a fountain. Boxer Floyd Mayweather then splashes himself with the water before the Michigan State mascot Sparty attempts to drink the water as the &quot;This is Sportscenter&quot; graphic is shown.
* A 2010 ad features Derek Jeter in the ESPN men&#x27;s locker room about to shave when he notices green hair in his razor. He asks ESPN employees Stuart Scott, Karl Ravech and Josh Elliot if they used his razor to which all answer in the negative. The color of the hair in the razor is not acknowledged by any party, as the Phillie Phanatic walks by with a towel around his waist, seemingly exiting from a shower. Jeter greets the Phanatic, still baffled by who used his razor.
* A 2010 ad features anchors John Buccigross and Dari Nowkhah coming out of the men&#x27;s room complaining how bad it smells and then the Colorado Rockies mascot Dinger comes out with toilet paper popping out of his butt.
* A 2010 ad features the Georgia Bulldogs mascot who runs through the cupboards of the ESPN kitchen until he finally finds some animal crackers.
* A 2011 ad features the Maryland Terrapins mascot Testudo arriving late at a pre-show meeting.
* A 2011 ad features the Pittsburgh Pirates mascot Pirate Parrot finding some crackers in the garbage after anchor Dari Nowkhah throws them away.
* A 2011 ad starts with Joey Votto and Karl Ravech washing their hands in the bathroom while Ravech raves about how he will win a mustache contest, as Cincinnati Reds mascot Mr. Redlegs emerges from a stall. Votto tells Ravech &quot;good luck with that&quot; while Ravech tells Mr. Redlegs he will win the contest.
* A 2012 ad features Bucky Badger, mascot for University of Wisconsin, looking at online pictures of Wilma Wildcat, mascot for University of Arizona, on his computer, then quickly minimizes it when Hannah Storm stops by, asking Bucky if a story he&#x27;s working on will be ready. When Hannah leaves, Bucky promptly returns to looking at pictures of Wilma.
* A 2012 ad featuring anchor Jay Harris and Chicago Bulls mascot Benny the Bull playing darts.
* A 2013 ad features Michigan State University&#x27;s Sparty and Rutgers&#x27; Scarlet Knight. The mascots are in the &quot;SportsCenter&quot; break room, making protein shakes. Sparty is putting protein shake powder in a blender container when anchor Jay Harris comes in with banana, yogurt and strawberries and asks &quot;hey fellas, you using both blenders?&quot;. Both mascots stare at Harris awkwardly and Sparty deliberately turns on the blender. Harris leaves in frustration.
* A 2013 ad features the Western Kentucky mascot, Big Red, trying and failing to climb into Brad Keselowski&#x27;s race car trying to get a ride home. Keselowski suggests that Red ride with Kevin Negandhi, who is leaving for the night, but Red continues to try to get in despite the fact he cannot fit.
* A 2014 ad has U.S. women&#x27;s soccer players Hope Solo and Alex Morgan playing keepie uppie with T.D., mascot for the Miami Dolphins. Jay Harris asks to join in, and promptly loses control of the ball, much to the frustration of the others.
* As part of the buildup toward Super Bowl XLVIII, Jay Crawford and Steve Levy are in an elevator which is boarded by Miles, the Denver Broncos mascot. Shortly before the elevator door closes the Seattle Seahawks&#x27; mascot, Blitz, who promptly knocks a clipboard out of Miles&#x27; hands. Miles responds by touching all of the floor buttons on the elevator and leaving, with Blitz chasing him. Crawford and Levy lament that this was only the beginning of Super Bowl week and there is still more to come. The Super Bowl was in New York that year, which is just over 100 miles southwest of ESPN&#x27;s home base.
* In a follow-up ad, Miles is in the men&#x27;s restroom as he tries to put on a Seahawks jersey while being mocked by Stuart Scott following a lost bet.
* A 2015 ad has the Stanford Tree shredding some papers while being mocked by anchor Kevin Connors since paper is made from trees.
* A 2016 ad features anchor John Anderson holding a post-show press conference in a parody of pre-game and post-game news conferences. However, the &quot;reporters&quot; turned out to be mascots Wally, Mr. Met, Slugggrrr, Billy the Marlin, Clark the Cub and the Phillie Phanatic.
* A 2016 ad features Miami Marlins mascot Billy the Marlin allegedly pulling a prank on Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte by tossing some tuna fish on Lochte&#x27;s keyboard.
* A 2017 ad features a collection of mascots attempting to hold a conference call. Because all of them are mute, and respond only by nodding or shaking their heads, the person on the other end of the line mistakenly believes the phone line is dead.
* A 2017 ad features Boston Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster working as a meteorologist but he gets in the way of the forecast and ends up getting replaced by Seattle Mariners mascot the Mariner Moose.
* A 2019 ad features ESPN MLB insider Buster Olney grabbing some honey only to be confronted by Chicago Cubs mascot Clark the Cub.

<text>Laura Mulvey (born 15 August 1941) is a British feminist film theorist and filmmaker. She was educated at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford. She is currently professor of film and media studies at Birkbeck, University of London. She previously taught at Bulmershe College, the London College of Printing, the University of East Anglia, and the British Film Institute.

During the 2008–09 academic year, Mulvey was the Mary Cornille Distinguished Visiting Professor in the Humanities at Wellesley College. Mulvey has been awarded three honorary degrees: in 2006 a Doctor of Letters from the University of East Anglia; in 2009 a Doctor of Law from Concordia University; and in 2012 a Bloomsday Doctor of Literature from University College Dublin.

==Film theory==
Mulvey is best known for her essay, &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot;, written in 1973 and published in 1975 in the influential British film theory journal &quot;Screen&quot;. It later appeared in a collection of her essays entitled &quot;Visual and Other Pleasures&quot;, as well as in numerous other anthologies. Her article, which was influenced by the theories of Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan, is one of the first major essays that helped shift the orientation of film theory towards a psychoanalytic framework. According to film scholar Robert Kolker, it &quot;remains a touchstone not only for film studies, but for art and literary analysis as well&quot;. Prior to Mulvey, film theorists such as Jean-Louis Baudry and Christian Metz used psychoanalytic ideas in their theoretical accounts of the cinema. Mulvey&#x27;s contribution, however, inaugurated the intersection of film theory, psychoanalysis and feminism. &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot; helped to bring the term &quot;male gaze&quot; into film criticism and eventually into common parlance. It was first used by the English art critic John Berger in his seminal &quot;Ways of Seeing&quot;, a series of films for the BBC aired in January 1972, and later a book, as part of his analysis of the treatment of the nude in European painting.

Mulvey states that she intends to use Freud and Lacan&#x27;s concepts as a &quot;political weapon&quot;. She employs some of their concepts to argue that the cinematic apparatus of classical Hollywood cinema inevitably put the spectator in a masculine subject position, with the figure of the woman on screen as the object of desire and &quot;the male gaze&quot;. In the era of classical Hollywood cinema, viewers were encouraged to identify with the protagonists, who were and still are overwhelmingly male. Meanwhile, Hollywood women characters of the 1950s and 1960s were, according to Mulvey, coded with &quot;to-be-looked-at-ness&quot; while the camera positioning and the male viewer constituted the &quot;bearer of the look&quot;. Mulvey suggests two distinct modes of the male gaze of this era: &quot;voyeuristic&quot; (i.e., seeing woman as image &quot;to be looked at&quot;) and &quot;fetishistic&quot; (i.e., seeing woman as a substitute for &quot;the lack&quot;, the underlying psychoanalytic fear of castration).

To account for the fascination of Hollywood cinema, Mulvey employs the concept of &quot;scopophilia&quot;. This concept was first introduced by Sigmund Freud in &quot;Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality&quot; (1905) and it refers to the pleasure gained from looking as well as to the pleasure gained from being looked at, two fundamental human drives in Freud’s view. Sexual in origin, the concept of scopophilia has voyeuristic, exhibitionistic and narcissistic overtones and it is what keeps the male audience’s attention on the screen. According to Anneke Smelik, Professor of the Department of Modern Languages and Cultures at Radboud University, classic cinema encourages the deep desire to look through the incorporation of structures of voyeurism and narcissism into the narrative and image of the film. As regards the narcissistic overtone of scopophilia, narcissistic visual pleasure can arise from self-identification with the image. In Mulvey’s view, male spectators project their look, and thus themselves, onto the male protagonists. In this manner, male spectators come to indirectly possess the woman on screen as well. Furthermore, Mulvey explores the concept of scopophilia in relation to two axes: one of activity and one of passivity. This “binary opposition is gendered.” The male characters are seen as active and powerful: they are endowed with agentivity and the narrative unfolds around them. On the other hand, females are presented as passive and powerless: they are objects of desire that exist solely for male pleasure, and thus females are placed in an exhibitionist role. This perspective is further perpetuated in &quot;unconscious patriarchal society&quot;.

Furthermore, as regards the fetishistic mode of the male gaze as suggested by Mulvey, this is one way in which the threat of castration is solved. According to Mulvey, the paradox of the image of ‘woman’ is that although they stand for attraction and seduction, they also stand for the lack of the phallus, which results in &quot;castration anxiety&quot;. As previously stated, the fear of castration is solved through fetishism, but also through the narrative structure. To alleviate said fear on the level of narrative, the female character must be found guilty. To exemplify this kind of narrative plot, Mulvey analyzes the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Josef von Sternberg, such as &quot;Vertigo&quot; (1958) and &quot;Morocco&quot; (1930), respectively. This tension is resolved through the death of the female character (as in Vertigo, 1958) or through her marriage with the male protagonist (as in Hitchcock’s &quot;Marnie&quot;, 1964). Through fetishization of the female form, attention to the female “lack” is diverted, and thus, renders women a safe object of pure beauty, not a threatening object.

Mulvey also explores Jacques Lacan’s concepts of &quot;ego formation&quot; and &quot;the mirror stage&quot;. In Lacan’s view, children gain pleasure through the identification with a perfect image reflected in the mirror, which shapes children’s ego ideal. For Mulvey, this notion is analogous to the manner in which the spectator obtains narcissistic pleasure from the identification with a human figure on the screen, that of the male characters. Both identifications are based on Lacan’s concept of &quot;méconnaissance&quot; (misrecognition), which means that such identifications are “blinded by narcissistic forces that structure them rather than being acknowledged.”

Different filming techniques are at the service of making voyeurism into an essentially male prerogative, that is, voyeuristic pleasure is exclusively male. As regards camera work, the camera films from the optical as well as libidinal point of view of the male character, contributing to the spectator’s identification with the male look. Furthermore, Mulvey argues that cinematic identifications are gendered, structured along sexual difference. The representation of powerful male characters is opposite to the representation of powerless female characters. Hence, the spectator readily identifies with the male characters. The representation of powerless female characters can be achieved through camera angle. The camera films women from above, at a high camera angle, thus portraying women as defenseless. Camera movement, editing and lighting are used in this respect as well. A case in point here is the film &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; (1990). Here, it is possible to appreciate the portrayal of the female protagonist, Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster), as an object of stare. In the opening sequence, the elevator scene shows Clarice surrounded by several tall FBI agents, all dressed identically, all towering above her, “all subjecting her to their (male) gaze.”

Mulvey argues that the only way to annihilate the patriarchal Hollywood system is to radically challenge and re-shape the filmic strategies of classical Hollywood with alternative feminist methods. She calls for a new feminist avant-garde filmmaking that would rupture the narrative pleasure of classical Hollywood filmmaking. She writes, &quot;It is said that analyzing pleasure or beauty annihilates it. That is the intention of this article.&quot;

&quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot; was the subject of much interdisciplinary discussion among film theorists, which continued into the mid-1980s. Critics of the article pointed out that Mulvey&#x27;s argument implies the impossibility of the enjoyment of classical Hollywood cinema by women, and that her argument did not seem to take into account spectatorship not organized along normative gender lines. Mulvey addresses these issues in her later (1981) article, &quot;Afterthoughts on &#x27;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&#x27; inspired by King Vidor&#x27;s &quot;Duel in the Sun&quot; (1946),&quot; in which she argues a metaphoric &#x27;transvestism&#x27; in which a female viewer might oscillate between a male-coded and a female-coded analytic viewing position. These ideas led to theories of how gay, lesbian, and bisexual spectatorship might also be negotiated. Her article was written before the findings of the later wave of media audience studies on the complex nature of fan cultures and their interaction with stars. Queer theory, such as that developed by Richard Dyer, has grounded its work in Mulvey to explore the complex projections that many gay men and women fix onto certain female stars (e.g., Doris Day, Liza Minnelli, Greta Garbo, Marlene Dietrich, Judy Garland).

Another point of criticism over Mulvey&#x27;s essay is the presence of gender essentialism in her work; that is, the idea that the female body has a set of attributes that are necessary to its identity and function and that is essentially other to masculinity. Then, the question of sexual identity suggests opposed ontological categories based on a biological experience of genital sex. As a result, affirming that there is an essence to being a woman contradicts the idea that being a woman is a construction of the patriarchal system.

Regarding Mulvey&#x27;s view of the identity of the gaze, some authors questioned &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot; on the matter of whether the gaze is really always male. Mulvey does not acknowledge a protagonist and a spectator other than a heterosexual male, failing to consider a woman or homosexual as the gaze. Other critics pointed out that there is an oversimplification of gender relations in &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot;. According to them, Mulvey&#x27;s essay shows a binary and categorical division of genders into male and female. This view does not acknowledge theoretical postulates put forward by LGBTQ+ theorists—and the community itself—that understand gender as something flexible.

Additionally, Mulvey is criticized for not acknowledging other than white spectators. From this viewpoint, by not recognizing racial differences, when Mulvey refers to &quot;women&quot;, she is only speaking about white women. For some authors, Mulvey does not consider the black female spectators who choose not to identify with white womanhood and who would not take on the phallocentric gaze of desire and possession. Thus, Mulvey fails to consider that these women create a critical space outside of the active/male passive/female dichotomy.

Feminist critic Gaylyn Studlar wrote extensively to problematize Mulvey&#x27;s central thesis that the spectator is male and derives visual pleasure from a dominant and controlling perspective. Studlar suggested rather that visual pleasure for all audiences is derived from a passive, masochistic perspective, where the audience seeks to be powerless and overwhelmed by the cinematic image.

Mulvey later wrote that her article was meant to be a provocation or a manifesto, rather than a reasoned academic article that took all objections into account. She addressed many of her critics, and clarified many of her points, in &quot;Afterthoughts&quot; (which also appears in the &quot;Visual and Other Pleasures&quot; collection).

Mulvey&#x27;s most recent book is titled &quot;Death 24x a Second: Stillness and the Moving Image&quot; (2006). In this work, Mulvey responds to the ways in which video and DVD technologies have altered the relationship between film and viewer. No longer are audience members forced to watch a film in its entirety in a linear fashion from beginning to ending. Instead, viewers today exhibit much more control over the films they consume. In the preface to her book, therefore, Mulvey begins by explicating the changes that film has undergone between the 1970s and the 2000s. Whereas Mulvey notes that, when she first began writing about films, she had been &quot;preoccupied by Hollywood&#x27;s ability to construct the female star as ultimate spectacle, the emblem and guarantee of its fascination and power,&quot; she is now &quot;more interested in the way that those moments of spectacle were also moments of narrative halt, hinting at the stillness of the single celluloid frame.&quot; With the evolution of film-viewing technologies, Mulvey redefines the relationship between viewer and film. Before the emergence of VHS and DVD players, spectators could only gaze; they could not possess the cinema&#x27;s &quot;precious moments, images and, most particularly, its idols,&quot; and so, &quot;in response to this problem, the film industry produced, from the very earliest moments of fandom, a panoply of still images that could supplement the movie itself,&quot; which were &quot;designed to give the film fan the illusion of possession, making a bridge between the irretrievable spectacle and the individual&#x27;s imagination.&quot; These stills, larger reproductions of celluloid still-frames from the original reels of movies, became the basis for Mulvey&#x27;s assertion that even the linear experience of a cinematic viewing has always exhibited a modicum of stillness. Thus, until a fan could adequately control a film to fulfill his or her own viewing desires, Mulvey notes that &quot;the desire to possess and hold the elusive image led to repeated viewing, a return to the cinema to watch the same film over and over again.&quot; However, with digital technology, spectators can now pause films at any given moment, replay their favourite scenes, and even skip the scenes they do not desire to watch. According to Mulvey, this power has led to the emergence of her &quot;possessive spectator.&quot; Films, then, can now be &quot;delayed and thus fragmented from linear narrative into favorite moments or scenes&quot; in which &quot;the spectator finds a heightened relation to the human body, particularly that of the star.&quot; It is within the confines of this redefined relationship that Mulvey asserts that spectators can now engage in a sexual form of possession of the bodies they see on screen.

Mulvey believes that avant-garde film &quot;poses certain questions which consciously confront traditional practice, often with a political motivation&quot; that work towards changing &quot;modes of representation&quot; as well as &quot;expectations in consumption.&quot; Mulvey has stated that feminists recognise modernist avant-garde &quot;as relevant to their own struggle to develop a radical approach to art.&quot;

==Phallocentrism and patriarchy==

Mulvey incorporates the Freudian idea of phallocentrism into &quot;Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema&quot;. Using Freud&#x27;s thoughts, Mulvey insists on the idea that the images, characters, plots and stories, and dialogues in films are inadvertently built on the ideals of patriarchies, both within and beyond sexual contexts. She also incorporates the works of thinkers including Jacques Lacan and meditates on the works of directors Josef von Sternberg and Alfred Hitchcock.

Within her essay, Mulvey discusses several different types of spectatorship that occur while viewing a film. Viewing a film involves unconsciously or semi-consciously engaging the typical societal roles of men and women. The &quot;three different looks&quot;, as they are referred to, explain just exactly how films are viewed in relation to phallocentrism. The first &quot;look&quot; refers to the camera as it records the actual events of the film. The second &quot;look&quot; describes the nearly voyeuristic act of the audience as one engages in watching the film itself. Lastly, the third &quot;look&quot; refers to the characters that interact with one another throughout the film.

The main idea that seems to bring these actions together is that &quot;looking&quot; is generally seen as an active male role while the passive role of being looked at is immediately adopted as a female characteristic. It is under the construction of patriarchy that Mulvey argues that women in film are tied to desire and that female characters hold an &quot;appearance coded for strong visual and erotic impact&quot;. The female actor is never meant to represent a character that directly affects the outcome of a plot or keep the story line going, but is inserted into the film as a way of supporting the male role and &quot;bearing the burden of sexual objectification&quot; that he cannot.

==As a filmmaker==
Mulvey was prominent as an avant-garde filmmaker in the 1970s and 1980s. With Peter Wollen, her husband, she co-wrote and co-directed &quot;Penthesilea: Queen of the Amazons&quot; (1974), &quot;Riddles of the Sphinx&quot; (1977 – perhaps their most influential film), &quot;AMY!&quot; (1980), &quot;Crystal Gazing&quot; (1982), &quot;Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti&quot; (1982), and &quot;The Bad Sister&quot; (1982).

&quot;Penthesilea: Queen of the Amazons&quot; was the first of Mulvey and Wollen&#x27;s films. In this film, Mulvey attempted to link her own feminist writings on the Amazon myth with the paintings of Allen Jones. These writings concerned themes such as male fantasy, symbolic language, women in relation to men and the patriarchal myth. Both filmmakers were interested in exploring ideology as well as the &quot;structure of mythologizing, its position in mainstream culture and notions of modernism.&quot;

With &quot;Riddles of the Sphinx,&quot; Mulvey and Wollen connected &quot;modernist forms&quot; with a narrative that explored feminism and psychoanalytical theory. This film was fundamental in presenting film as a space &quot;in which the female experience could be expressed.&quot;

&quot;AMY!&quot; was a film tribute to Amy Johnson and explores the previous themes of Mulvey and Wollen&#x27;s past films. One of the main themes of the film is that women &quot;struggling towards achievement in the public sphere&quot; must transition between the male and female worlds.

&quot;Crystal Gazing&quot; exemplified more spontaneous filmmaking than their past films. Many of the elements of the film were decided once production began. The film was well received but lacked a &quot;feminist underpinning&quot; that had been the core of many of their past films.

The last films of Mulvey and Wollen as a team, &quot;Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti&quot; and &quot;The Bad Sister&quot; revisited feminist issues previously explored by the filmmakers.

In 1991, Mulvey returned to filmmaking with &quot;Disgraced Monuments&quot;, which she co-directed with Mark Lewis. This film examines &quot;the fate of revolutionary monuments in the Soviet Union after the fall of communism.&quot;

<text>Under the Influences is the second album by the American musician Mike Ness, released in 1999. It is a compilation of country, rock, and folk covers, issued the same year as his first solo effort, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot;.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic wrote: &quot;With repeated listens, Ness&#x27; voice seems monotonous compared to the pure country croon of the original artists. But covers are all about interpretation, and what Ness lacks in vocal finesse he makes up for with feeling.&quot;

<doc id="612681" wikidata="Q1425561" url="?curid=612681" title="Kawai Musical Instruments">
<text>is a musical instrument manufacturing company headquartered in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan. It is best known for its grand pianos, upright pianos, digital pianos, electronic keyboards and electronic synthesizers. The company was founded in August 1927.

==History==

Koichi Kawai, the company founder, was born in Hamamatsu, Japan in 1886. His neighbor, Torakusu Yamaha, a watchmaker and reed organ builder, took him in as an apprentice. Kawai became a member of the research and development team that introduced pianos to Japan. Yamaha died in 1916, and in the 1920s the piano industry faltered in Japan. New management took over control of Yamaha&#x27;s company, Nippon Gakki Co. (later renamed the Yamaha Corporation), and began to diversify its production line. This led Kawai to leave Nippon Gakki in 1927 and found the Kawai Musical Instrument Research Laboratory.

After Koichi Kawai&#x27;s death in 1955, his son, Shigeru Kawai became company president at 33 and expanded production facilities. In 1980, he opened the Ryuyo Grand Piano Factory. Shigeru Kawai was president of the Kawai company from 1955 to 1989, chairman from 1990 until 2002, and a company consultant until his death in 2006 at 84.

Shigeru Kawai&#x27;s son, Hirotaka Kawai, was appointed president in 1989. He integrated advanced robotics into the manufacturing process, established Kawai manufacturing facilities around the globe, and oversaw the introduction of several new series of grand, upright and digital pianos.

The Kawai Musical Instrument Manufacturing Company distributes acoustic and digital pianos to over 80 countries.

==Products==

===Pianos===
Since the 1970s, Kawai has pioneered the use of alternative materials to improve the consistency and stability of piano performance. In 1971, the company began to use acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), a composite material, for parts of its piano actions to overcome the problems associated with the use of wood. Kawai design engineers reasoned that the tendency of wood to shrink and swell significantly with changes in humidity made it less than ideal for use in a piano action, where exacting tolerances must be maintained to ensure stable piano touch. So they gradually replaced selected wooden action parts with ABS parts that they believed would remain more stable, particularly over time as their pianos age.

According to Kawai, scientific tests conducted by Professor Abdul Sadat at California Polytechnic University in 1998 found Kawai&#x27;s ABS action parts to be stronger than comparable wooden parts and far less susceptible to shrinking and swelling due to humidity. Kawai advertises that its use of composite parts makes its piano actions more stable and consistent than those made by other manufacturers.

In 2002, Kawai introduced its Millennium III grand piano action with ABS-Carbon, a new composite material that combined ABS with carbon fiber. The new material (dubbed ABS-Carbon) increased the strength of Kawai action parts, reducing their weight, which made the overall action operate faster (very important for control when playing repeated notes or trills). The addition of carbon fiber also increased the stiffness of ABS-Carbon action parts, allowing the action to produce more power for the player with less effort. Kawai contends that these advances in materials and design help its Millennium III action respond more accurately to the player&#x27;s intentions with greater consistency over time.

===Grand pianos===
Kawai grand pianos have evolved steadily over the decades from the Model 500/600 built in the 1960s and 1970s, to the KG Series in the 1980s and early 1990s that became popular among teachers and institutions. During these years, Kawai grand pianos earned a reputation for long-term, stable performance even in heavy use. In 1996, Kawai introduced the RX Series grand pianos featuring the Ultra-Responsive ABS Action. The RX Series continued to evolve with the introduction of the Millennium III Action with ABS-Carbon in 2004. In 2009, the RX BLAK Series debuted with a new Acoustic Resonant Solid Spruce soundboard and the addition of Phenolic Stabilizers on the hammers that further enhanced the precision of the hammer strike for improved tone and consistency. The RX BLAK Series pianos also incorporated many cosmetic changes.

In 1999, Kawai introduced the Shigeru Kawai grand piano series. These pianos are handmade by highly skilled technicians in a separate facility of Ryuyo Grand Piano Factory in Hamamatsu. Shigeru Kawai pianos are recognized as one of the best pianos in the world and are used in concerts and piano competitions all over the world alongside pianos manufactured by companies like Bösendorfer, Steinway, Yamaha and Fazioli. The Shigeru Kawai SK-EX full concert grand piano was introduced in 2001, and chosen as the official piano of the 2002 International Tchaikovsky Competition.

In 2013, Kawai introduced the GX BLAK Performance Series line of grand pianos. In Japanese, the word &quot;kuro&quot; (black) suggests wisdom, experience and nobility. Improvements include a stretcher-overlap integrated design (SOLID) and Konsei Katagi blended rim design for improved tone projection.

In 2015, Kawai introduced the GL Series line of grand pianos.

===Synthesizers===
Kawai started manufacturing synthesizers at the start of the 1980s under the brand name Teisco. These instruments were all analog and included the models: 60P, 60F, 110F, 100F, 100P, SX-210, SX-240, and SX-400. At some point, Kawai stopped using the &quot;Teisco&quot; brand, so some of these products can be found labelled either Teisco or Kawai.

During the second half of the 1980s, Kawai developed and released a number of digital synthesizers. The most known of these are the K series: Kawai K1, K1m, K1mkII, K3 (SSM2044-based filters), K4 and K5. These machines follow different synthesis approaches. The K4 use subtractive synthesis based on sampled waveforms, the K1 and K5 are additive synthesizers. The K1 is one of the first popular synthesizers that has no filter whatsoever; all sounds are made by stacking wave samples and applying frequency modulation. The K3 is hybrid in the sense that it does employ additive synthesis for waveform generation, but these waveforms are static and cannot be modulated as in a true additive synthesizer; instead, waveshaping is done using a low-pass filter, therefore characterizing this machine as a subtractive synthesizer. Uniquely for their price range, all instruments feature aftertouch. Kawai also manufactured rack versions of most of these instruments, Kawai Q-80 MIDI sequencer (1988), and an external MIDI programming device, MM-16 MIDI Mixer (MIDI processor with slider controllers).

Later developments resulted in Kawai Spectra KC10 (1990) based on the K4 engine, along with a group of original multitimbral instruments, including Kawai PH-50 Pop Keyboard and its half-rack version PHm, and XS-1 sound module (1989), and a group of General MIDI (GM) compatible instruments including Kawai KC20 GM Sound Keyboard (early 1990s), GMega sound module (early 1990s) as an update of previous XS-1, and K11 (1993) based on GMega and K1, etc.

In 1996 Kawai released the K5000, an advanced additive synthesizer that greatly improved on the K5 and is now regarded as one of Kawai&#x27;s very best instruments. It was manufactured in three versions: K5000S, which had 16 knobs for real-time control and an arpeggiator, K5000W which added a sequencer but lacked both the knobs and the arpeggiator, and the K5000R, a rack version with an arpeggiator, but no sequencer and no knobs. A Knobs Macro Box was sold separately for use with the W and R models. Kawai originally planned to release K5000X, which would combine the features of the S and W models with a 76-key keyboard and enhanced memory, but this was cancelled in the late &#x27;90s due to bad sales. Shortly thereafter the company stopped producing synthesizers.

===Drum machines===
The Kawai R-100 and R50 drum machines were both manufactured from around 1987. The Kawai XD-5, a drum synthesizer based on the K4 engine, was produced in 1989-1990.

===Organs===
Kawai produces a line of electronic organs under the name &quot;Dreamatone&quot;. Kawai also owns Lowrey organs. Kawai previously offered the &quot;MORE&quot; series, a home organ product line applying the high-end technology of their theater models, &quot;T-50&quot; and &quot;T-30&quot;. The &quot;MORE&quot; series was merged into &quot;Dreamatone&quot; family in fall 1979.

===Other products===
The company also manufactures MIDI controllers.

The company has built guitars and basses in the past. The F-series from approximately late 1970 to 1990 have a neck thru guitar design.

<text>Sputnik 3 (, Satellite 3) was a Soviet satellite launched on 15 May 1958 from Baikonur Cosmodrome by a modified R-7/SS-6 ICBM. The scientific satellite carried a large array of instruments for geophysical research of the upper atmosphere and near space. 
Sputnik 3 was the only Soviet satellite launched in 1958. Like its American counterpart, Vanguard 1, Sputnik 3 reached orbit during the International Geophysical Year.

== History ==
On 30 January 1956, the USSR Council of Ministers approved a project to launch an artificial Earth satellite using the R-7 rocket. Nicknamed &quot;Object D&quot;, it would be the fifth type of payload built for the R-7 intercontinental ballistic missile, also known by its GURVO designation as 8K71. The original plan envisioned a sophisticated laboratory limited to 1,000 to 1,400 kg, of which 200 to 300 kg would be scientific instruments. It was intended to be launched during the International Geophysical Year as the first satellite by the Soviet Union but ended up being the third due to problems developing the extensive scientific experiments and their telemetry system. Despite earlier work done by Mikhail Tikhonravov, much of the satellite&#x27;s design had little precedent. The creation and use of pressurized equipment, long-range communications systems, automated switches, and a metal construct to work in Earth orbit were all uncharted territories. By July 1956, OKB-1 had completed the preliminary design, but modifications to the R-7 for a satellite launch was ready before Object D could be finished. Worried at the prospect of the United States launching a satellite before he could, Sergei Korolev decided that the relatively simple &quot;Prosteyshiy Sputnik-1&quot; (&quot;Simplest Satellite 1&quot;, or &quot;PS-1)&quot;, also known as Sputnik 1, would be the first satellite to be launched instead. Sputnik 2 (PS-2) was also ready and therefore launched earlier than Object D.

== Launch ==
Sputnik 3 was launched by a modified R-7 Semyorka missile developed for satellite launches, the Sputnik 8A91.

The 8A91 was a transitional design between the initial 8K71 test model R-7 and the operational 8K74, which had yet to fly. Improvements in manufacturing processes were used to reduce the gauge of the slosh baffles in the propellant tanks and cut down on weight. The engines were slightly more powerful and the changes in mass resulted in modifications to the flight plan--the core stage would be throttled down and the strap-ons throttled up 25% prior to their jettison. An interstage section replaced the radio equipment bay at the top of the booster, and the telemetry package was also moved here.

The launch was planned for 20 April, but technical delays meant that several more days were needed. On 27 April, the 8A91 booster lifted from LC-1 and all appeared normal for over a minute into the launch. Around minutes, things went awry. The strap-on boosters broke away from the core and the entire launch vehicle tumbled to earth downrange. Ground crews monitoring radar tracking data from the booster noticed the trajectory angle change to negative numbers, followed by a complete loss of signal. The last data packet received indicated that the booster had flown only 227 kilometers at signal loss.

Telemetry data indicated that abnormal vibrations began affecting the booster at T+90 seconds and vehicle breakup occurred seven seconds later. A search plane located the impact site. It was not clear what had caused the vibrations, but the decision was made to go ahead with the backup booster and satellite. The engines would be throttled down at T+85 seconds in the hope of reducing structural loads. Since the booster did not carry sufficient instrumentation to determine the source of the vibrations, which ultimately proved to be a phenomenon resulting from the propellant tanks emptying, it would end up being a recurring problem on lunar probe launches later in the year.

The satellite had separated from the launch vehicle and was recovered near the crash site largely intact. It was taken back to the Baikonur Cosmodrome for refurbishment, but an electrical short started a fire inside the electronics compartment and it could not be reused.

The backup booster and satellite were launched successfully on the morning of 15 May, specifically chosen as it was the anniversary of the R-7&#x27;s maiden flight. On the downside, telemetry data indicated that vibration affected the launch vehicle again and it came close to meeting the same fate as its predecessor. 

==Spacecraft==
While no Soviet satellite had been in orbit since the end of Sputnik 2 in April 1958, Sputnik 3 weighed about 100 times as much as the heaviest of the three active American satellites, and exceeded their combined scientific-data abilities. It was an automatic scientific laboratory spacecraft. It was conically shaped and was 3.57 m (11.7 ft) long and 1.73 m (5.68 ft) wide at its base. The satellite weighed 1,327 kg (1.46 tons) and carried twelve scientific instruments. After 692 days in orbit and completing thousands of orbits, Sputnik 3 reentered the atmosphere and burned up on 6 April 1960. It was powered by silver-zinc batteries and silicon solar cells.

== Mission ==
Sputnik 3 included twelve scientific instruments that provided data on pressure and composition of the upper atmosphere, concentration of charged particles, photons in cosmic rays, heavy nuclei in cosmic rays, magnetic and electrostatic fields, and meteoric particles. The onboard Tral-D tape recorder, intended to store data for later transmission to Earth failed, limiting data to what could be gathered while the satellite was directly visible from ground stations. Because of this failure, Sputnik 3 was unable to map the Van Allen radiation belt.

<text>Ivor Darreg (May 5, 1917 – February 12, 1994) was an American composer and leading proponent of microtonal or &quot;xenharmonic&quot; music. He also created a series of experimental musical instruments.

==Biography==
Darreg, a contemporary of Harry Partch and a close colleague of John H. Chalmers, Erv Wilson, and Joel Mandelbaum, was one of America&#x27;s leading theorists and practitioners of experimental intonation and experimental instrument building. Frequently he published his writings in his own Xenharmonic Bulletin.

Darreg was born Kenneth Vincent Gerard O&#x27;Hara in Portland, Oregon. His father John O&#x27;Hara was editor of the (Portland) Catholic Sentinel newspaper and his mother was an artist. (His Uncle, Edwin Vincent O&#x27;Hara, was a Roman Catholic Bishop.) He dropped out of school as a teenager, but he had both self-taught facility in at least ten languages and a basic understanding of all the sciences. His real love was music and electronics. Because of his choice of music, his father cast him out, and he and his mother set out on their own with little help from anyone. At that point he took on the name &quot;Ivor,&quot; which means &quot;man with bow&quot; (from his cello-playing talents) and &quot;Drareg&quot; (the retrograde of &quot;Gerard&quot;), which he soon changed to &quot;Darreg&quot;.

In the forties, Ivor built an Amplified Cello, Amplified Clavichord, and Electric Organ, the Electric Keyboard Oboe and the Electric Keyboard Drum. The Amplified Clavichord and Electric Organ no longer exist, but the Electric Keyboard Oboe - like the organ, based on blocking oscillator circuits and capable of microtonality -, the Electric Keyboard Drum, which uses buzzer-like relays, and the Amplified Cello are still working. In the 1970s Darreg built a series of instruments he called Megalyras. Part of his concept was that the several strings were to be tuned like the several pipes that comprise a single &quot;note&quot; in an organ stop—multiple pipes at sounding together at selected, closely related pitches to create the sense not of several tones but of one grand composite tone.

Darreg lived for much of his adult life in or near Los Angeles, California, then spent his final nine years in San Diego. He devoted his entire life to his music and microtonality. Ivor sported a long beard to cover the fact that due to both an illness and confrontation from a violent break-in to his home in the 1950s, he had lost his teeth. He consequently taught himself to pronounce words and sing without them. He would often accompany his music with singing. He would sing the high notes in the morning when his vocal cords were tighter and the low notes in the evenings when they were more relaxed. His songs were often in Esperanto, a language in which he was fluent. He coined the term &quot;xenharmonic&quot;, designed and built many original microtonal musical instruments, and wrote voluminous amounts of material about various musical tunings. Perhaps his most important contribution to music theory was his idea that different tunings exhibit different &quot;moods&quot;.

Darreg&#x27;s informal network of microtonal musicians writing letters to each other later morphed into the more formal &quot;Xenharmonic Alliance&quot;.

<text>Dominion Chalmers United Church is a large United church, located in downtown Ottawa, at the corner of Cooper and O&#x27;Connor Streets (with access from Lisgar Street). It is a 1962 merger of two key congregations from both the Methodist and Presbyterian traditions, each possessing lengthy histories.

==History==
Chalmers Presbyterian/United Church, was originally Bank Street Canada Presbyterian Church, located on nearby Bank Street at Slater Street from 1866 to 1914. Alexander Cowper Hutchison (architect) designed the Bank Street Presbyterian Church at Bank Street at Slater Street in 1868.

The Bank Street Presbyterian Church building was reconstructed by the architect William Hodgson in 1881 after a fire. Alexander Cowper Hutchison designed the Bank Street Presbyterian Sunday School in 1890.

The Bank Street Presbyterian Church was renamed after Thomas Chalmers, a leader of the 1843 disruption in the Church of Scotland that led to the formation of the Free Church, and in Ottawa, their &quot;parent&quot; congregation of Knox Presbyterian, is now located just two blocks east on Lisgar at Elgin Street. Alexander Cowper Hutchison designed the Chalmers Presbyterian Church on O&#x27;Connor Street at Cooper Street, 1912–1914.

The Metcalfe Street building was built in 1830 as Metcalfe Street Methodist. In 1852 this group merged with those from Rideau Street, and the building was enlarged and renamed The Dominion in 1876. The Dominion Methodist Church, which was located on Metcalfe Street at Queen Street, was designed by the architect Henry Hodge Horsey and built between 1875 and 1876. The Dominion Methodist plaque lists Alexis Helmer, whose death was the inspiration for John McCrae&#x27;s poem, &quot;In Flanders Fields&quot;.

The building was destroyed in a fire in February 1961.

The Dominion Methodist/United Church&#x27;s roots go back to Methodist circuit riders visitations in Hull, Lower Canada from 1816, and a wooden structure built on Rideau Street in the Lower Town in 1827.

The Dominion-Chalmers (or DC Church) buildings have recently undergone major renovations to their large sanctuary (damaged by a fire in 1955), and is used for concerts; and for other special events, sometimes of a national nature.

==The Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre==
In 2018, Carleton University purchased the church building as a performance space, though the congregation will continue to use the building for religious services as well. After its repossession, it was officially renamed the Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre, although it is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the amalgamated Carleton Dominion-Chalmers &quot;United&quot; Centre. Mara Brown was announced as this extension&#x27;s first director on 1 April 2019, effective 15 April 2019. Prior to this appointment, on 26 March 2019, the university held a festival of life celebration for Professor Pius Adesanmi, Director of Carleton&#x27;s Institute of African Studies; one of 18 Canadian persons to have died in a tragic plane crash on 10 March 2019.

==State funerals==
Several Canadian state funerals have been held in the building: of George Eulas Foster in 1932, Sidney Earle Smith in 1959, and Ed Broadbent in 2024.

<text>New Rose Hotel is a 1998 American science fiction erotic thriller film co-written and directed by Abel Ferrara and starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. It is based on William Gibson&#x27;s 1984 short story of the same name.

==Plot==
Fox and X are Tokyo-based freelance industrial spies who specialize in helping R&amp;D scientists defect from corporations who would rather see them dead than working for competitors. Fox is obsessed with Dr. Hiroshi, a paradigm-shattering super-genius who works for Maas, the corporation that crippled Fox. Japanese firm Hosaka hires Fox and X to help Hiroshi defect, offering a fee of $50 million. Fox and X hire Sandii, a small-time nightclub singer and call girl in Shinjuku, to help persuade Hiroshi to defect to a newly outfitted Hosaka lab in Marrakech.

While training her for the extraction, X falls in love with Sandii, who offers conflicting accounts of her past. Fox and X meet with representatives from Hosaka and negotiate their fee up to $100 million. Sandii meets Hiroshi in Vienna and persuades him to leave his wife and defect to Hosaka. Fox then travels to Marrakech to await Hiroshi&#x27;s arrival, and X arranges to spend a night with Sandii in Berlin before her rendezvous in Marrakech.

Sandii proposes that she and X leave Fox, marry, and live together. X offers to discuss it after Sandii visits Marrakech. That night, while Sandii sleeps, X rummages through her personal effects, finding cash, information about her aliases, and an unmarked computer chip.

Hosaka transfers the agreed-upon $100 million fee. Fox returns from Marrakech, and X informs him that he will be meeting Sandii in Shinjuku to start a new life with her, a plan that Fox begrudgingly accepts. Later, Fox and X celebrate the success of the operation and their newfound wealth with a group of prostitutes. The next day, X&#x27;s contact in Marrakech informs him that Hosaka has relocated many of their top scientists to the new lab in Marrakech, a move that Fox decries as unsafe but potentially lucrative for him and X, despite X&#x27;s insistence that he is finished with the case.

During the night, X&#x27;s Marrakech contact informs him that somebody discreetly reprogrammed the lab&#x27;s DNA synthesizer to spread a virus that killed everyone, including Hiroshi, and that Sandii has vanished. X also discovers that the bank account holding the $100 million has been wiped out. Fox tells him that Maas must have recruited Sandii in Vienna and ordered her to kill Hosaka&#x27;s scientists in Marrakech, and that Hosaka, presuming that Fox and X were part of the conspiracy, has wiped their account and will send agents to eliminate them. After being surrounded by Hosaka agents in a department store, Fox leaps to his death. X flees to a run-down capsule hotel called the New Rose Hotel. There, he reflects on his time with Fox and Sandii and views footage of Sandii using the unmarked computer chip in the DNA synthesizer in Marrakech to kill Hosaka&#x27;s scientists. Knowing that Hosaka agents will hunt him wherever he goes, X contemplates suicide before masturbating to the memory of his last night with Sandii.

Edward R. Pressman had owned the film rights to &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; since the late 1980s. Before Ferrara became involved, Kathryn Bigelow was originally set to direct. Zoë Tamerlis Lund wrote the first draft of the script in 1996.

According to Ferrara, both Virginie Ledoyen and Chloë Sevigny were considered for the role of Sandii. Ferrara also claims that Arnold Schwarzenegger was considered for the role of Fox.

Asia Argento made a documentary about Ferrara, titled &quot;Abel/Asia&quot; (1998), during the making of the film.

Ferrara said he fired a lot of the crew members of the film; some of them were longtime collaborators of Ferrara&#x27;s, such as film composer Joe Delia.

<text>Anton &quot;Toni&quot; Burger (19 November 1911 – 25 December 1991) was a (Captain) in the German Nazi SS, in Greece (1944) and of Theresienstadt concentration camp.

==Military career==
Anton Burger was born in Neunkirchen, Austria, the son of a stationery dealer. He joined the Austrian Army in 1930 and the Austrian Nazi Party in 1932. In June 1933 the Nazi Party was officially banned in Austria by the government of Engelbert Dollfuss and Burger was dishonorably discharged from the army in July. He moved illegally to Lechfeld near Augsburg in Germany, where he became a member of the Austrian Legion, a paramilitary group composed of pro-Nazi Austrian expatriates. Shortly afterward he joined the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; (SA). In 1935 he received German citizenship and moved into the SA barracks.

Burger went to Vienna to participate with the Austrian Legion in the &quot;Anschluss&quot; on 12 March 1938. He was inducted into the SS and assigned to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Vienna, where he was a member of the Reich Security Main Office Special Action Command &quot;Eichmann&quot; (RSHA Sondereinsatzkommando under Adolf Eichmann).

In the summer of 1939, he was transferred to the Central Agency for Jewish Emigration in Prague, where he participated in the expropriation of about 1,400 Jewish households. In April 1941 he was promoted to &quot;Obersturmführer&quot; (Second Lieutenant). In the spring of 1941 he was promoted to head of the RSHA branch office in Brno.

In 1942 Burger was ordered to Brussels by Eichmann to coordinate efforts to deport Belgian, Dutch and French Jews. Burger served at Auschwitz concentration camp in 1943 before becoming the Commandant of Theresienstadt concentration camp from July 3, 1943, to February 7, 1944. He was known for his cruelty as a camp commander; on 11 November 1943 he ordered the entire camp population of approximately 40,000 people to stand in freezing weather during a camp census. About 300 prisoners died of hypothermia as a result.

In February 1944 he was sent to Greece by Eichmann to replace Dieter Wisliceny, with whom Eichmann was dissatisfied. As head of the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; in Athens under Colonel Walter Blume, Burger organized the deportations of Romaniote and Sephardi Jews from Rhodes, Kos, Athens Ioannina, and Corfu (a total of over 3,000 people), earning a promotion to SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; (Captain) by June 1944.

==Capture and escapes==
After the war, Burger was arrested in Altaussee, Austria and held in an internment camp near Salzburg. He was then convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by the People&#x27;s Court in the Czech Litoměřice and sentenced to death. In June 1947, shortly before he could be extradited to Austria so he could be executed, Burger escaped from the detention center. He lived under an assumed name in his hometown of Neunkirchen until his second arrest in March 1951 after which he was held in Austrian custody in Vienna. On 9 April 1951, Burger managed to escape and disappeared without a trace.

Following his second escape he lived on the border of Germany and Austria under eight different aliases. From 1960 to 1961 he worked as a warden on a mountain near the river Alm. After 1961, despite poorly forged documents, Burger moved with his wife Elfriede to the city of Essen and began working as a salesman under the name Wilhelm Bauer. After being laid off in 1974 and suffering a heart attack he lived out his days in Essen until his death from natural causes on Christmas Day 1991. His identity was not uncovered until March 1994, more than two years after his death. This was confirmed to the Vienna Simon Wiesenthal Center by the Bavarian &quot;Landeskriminalamt&quot;.

In 2011, it was revealed that Burger had in fact not made up the name &quot;Wilhelm Bauer&quot;. Wilhelm Bauer was a Jewish prisoner at Theresienstadt whom Burger had personally murdered in 1944. Bauer at the time had been collaborating with the Nazis and making a propaganda film, believing that collaboration meant survival. Burger strongly disliked Bauer because he wore glasses, and to Burger, that meant Jewish intellectualism and weakness.

<doc id="612718" wikidata="Q7011334" url="?curid=612718" title="New Rose Hotel">
<text>&quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; is a short story by William Gibson, first published in &quot;Omni&quot; in July 1984 and later included in his 1986 collection &quot;Burning Chrome&quot;.

&quot;New Rose Hotel&quot; presents a bleak future as extrapolated from contemporary economic and social trends. Set in the same period and universe as Gibson&#x27;s Sprawl trilogy, it is solidly cyberpunk in its style and vision.

==Plot==
The story is set in a future time when huge megacorporations have gained enough influence to control the economies of entire countries. Their wealth and competitive advantage stem from the human capital of their employees and the intellectual property they produce. Corporations jealously guard their most valuable employees and go to great expense to keep them safe and happily productive. There is little point in traditional corporate espionage, as new technologies are developed so quickly that stolen secrets soon become obsolete. Instead, the field has now evolved to the point of enticing valuable employees to switch their loyalty from one company to another and arranging for their escape ― a highly dangerous endeavor, given the tight security in place around such individuals.

Two male free-lance agents, Fox and the unnamed narrator, have been hired by the Japanese firm Hosaka to bring genetic researcher Hiroshi Yomiuri over from Maas Biolabs GmbH, a German rival. They bring in a third associate, a woman named Sandii, to seduce Hiroshi and persuade him to defect. The narrator begins a relationship with Sandii as the three arrange for Hiroshi&#x27;s move to a secret laboratory in Marrakech, purchased by the narrator with Hosaka funds. On the night before the transfer is to take place, the narrator spends time with Sandii and finds an unlabeled computer disk in her purse, but disregards it.

Fox, Sandii, and the narrator orchestrate Hiroshi&#x27;s disappearance from a street in Vienna and spirit him away to the Marrakech lab. Hosaka pays the three and erases all evidence of having done business with them; the two men fly to Japan and part ways with Sandii. The company sends its top researchers to the lab to meet with Hiroshi, only for everyone there to die or suffer permanent brain damage in a sudden outbreak of disease. Hosaka wipes out the bank accounts of Fox and the narrator, cuts off their business connections, and sends assassins to kill them, blaming them for the deaths. The two men flee, realizing that Sandii had secretly defected to Maas and reprogrammed Hiroshi&#x27;s equipment to release the virus. Fox falls to his death after being pushed off a mezzanine railing, while the narrator goes into hiding at the titular New Rose Hotel, a run-down capsule hotel.

One week later, the narrator is still there, contemplating suicide, pining for Sandii while berating himself for overlooking the disk and her treachery, and waiting for Hosaka forces to arrive. 

==Film==
Director Abel Ferrara adapted the short story as a feature film, &quot;New Rose Hotel&quot;, released in 1998; the film scrupulously followed the plot of the short story. Fox is portrayed by Christopher Walken, Hiroshi is portrayed by Yoshitaka Amano, Sandii is portrayed by Asia Argento, and X is portrayed by Willem Dafoe.

<text>Irmfried Eberl (8 September 1910 – 16 February 1948) was an Austrian psychiatrist and medical director of the euthanasia institutes in Brandenburg and Bernburg, who helped set up and was the first commandant of the Treblinka extermination camp where he worked as SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; from 11 July 1942 until his dismissal on 26 August 1942. He was arrested after the end of the war in January 1948. Eberl hanged himself the following month to avoid trial.

==Early life==
Irmfried Eberl was born in Bregenz, Austria on 8 September 1910. He joined the Nazi Party on 8 December 1931 while still a medical student at the University of Innsbruck. Eberl graduated from the medical program in 1933 and gained his doctorate a year later. After February 1935 he served as an assistant physician. Trained and practising as a psychiatrist, he was a firm supporter of the mass murder of people with mental disorders.

== Killing of disabled persons ==
When the T-4 Euthanasia Program commenced, Eberl was a willing participant. On 1 February 1940, at 29 years old, Eberl became the medical director of the killing facility at Brandenburg. In autumn 1941 he assumed the same position at Bernburg Euthanasia Centre. Despite not being formally ordered to take part, psychiatrists such as Eberl were at the center of each stage of justifying, planning and carrying out the mass murder of those with mental disorders, and constituted the connection to the later annihilation of Jews and other &quot;undesirables&quot; in the Holocaust.

==Treblinka death camp==
When public outcry against Action T-4 forced its abandonment in Germany, Eberl found himself out of work. This did not last long, as the Nazi leadership made the decision to use the Action T-4 personnel to murder much larger numbers of people in Poland, using variations of the methods used in the T-4 killings. Eberl was first transferred to Chełmno extermination camp for a brief stint. On 11 July 1942, Eberl was transferred to the command of Treblinka as part of Operation Reinhard. Eberl&#x27;s poor management of the camp soon proved to be disastrous in the opinion of his colleague Willi Mentz; although historians point out that the number of transports that were coming in also reflected the high command&#x27;s wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka&#x27;s ability to &quot;process&quot; these prisoners.

SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Willi Mentz, an SS officer at Treblinka, testified of Eberl&#x27;s leadership:

According to SS-&quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Hans Hingst:

Eberl was dismissed from Treblinka on 26 August 1942, for incompetence in disposing of the bodies of the thousands of people who had been killed, and was replaced by Franz Stangl, who was previously the commandant of Sobibor extermination camp. Eberl was also relieved of his duty because he was not killing people in an efficient and timely enough manner, and because he was not properly concealing the mass murder from locals. For instance, the stench from decomposition of unburied bodies was such that it could be smelled from the camp, such as at the nearby village of Treblinka, Masovian Voivodeship, which in turn would make it self-evident that unnatural numbers of deaths were happening nearby, causing concern among locals. The Nazi leadership wished to avoid any inconveniences to their operations that would result from local outcries. Eberl was apparently part of a ring at the camp that was stealing the possessions of the people whom they had murdered and sending them back to cohorts at Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery in Berlin. This last activity had been expressly forbidden by Himmler, as he wanted this property to be contributed to the German war effort.

In 1970, Stangl, then in prison for his own crimes, described Treblinka when he first came to the death camp while it was still under Eberl&#x27;s command:

Eberl was sent back to Bernburg Euthanasia Centre for a short spell afterwards.

== Apprehension and suicide ==
In 1944 he joined the Wehrmacht for the remainder of the war. After the war ended, Eberl continued to practice medicine in Blaubeuren. He found himself a widower when his first wife died in July 1944. In October 1946 he married a second time.

Eberl was arrested in January 1948. He hanged himself in his cell the following month to avoid trial.

<doc id="612723" wikidata="Q6050069" url="?curid=612723" title="International Dance Teachers Association">
<text>The International Dance Teachers Association (IDTA) is a dance teaching and examination board based in Brighton, England. Operating internationally, the IDTA currently has over 7,000 members in 55 countries. The IDTA is recognised by the national qualifications regulators in England and Wales, Ofqual and the Council for Dance Education and Training, and is also affiliated to the British Dance Council, the Central Council of Physical Recreation and the Theatre Dance Council International. The IDTA works in partnership with the Royal Academy of Dance. The IDTA publishes a print and online magazine for members titled &quot;Dance International&quot; four times a year.

==History==
The International Dance Teachers Association was formed in 1967 as the result of a merger between the Dance Teachers&#x27; Association (DTA), and the International Dancing Masters Association (IDMA). Both of these organisations were formed from the merging of older dance teaching associations, with the earliest being established in 1903. The IDTA subsequently celebrated its centenary in 2003.

The earliest predecessor of IDTA was the Manchester and Salford Association of Teachers of Dancing, founded in 1903. This later became known as the Empire Society, (ESTD), in 1938. In 1920, another group of teachers in Birmingham formed the Midland Association of Teachers of Dancing (MATD), which eventually merged with the Empire Society in 1961 to form the Dance Teachers&#x27; Association.

In the early post-World War I years, a number of other small dance organisations were formed: the English Dancing Masters Association (EDMA), the Premier Association of Teachers of Dancing (PATD), the Universal Association of Dane Teachers (UADT), and the Yorkshire Association of Dancing Masters (YADM). These four organisations merged in 1930 to form the International Dancing Masters&#x27; Association.

After their merger in 1967, the organization was renamed the International Dance Teachers&#x27; Association.

<text>Number 1 Squadron, also known as No. 1 (Fighter) Squadron, is a squadron of the Royal Air Force. It was the first squadron to fly a VTOL aircraft. It currently operates Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth.

The squadron motto, &quot;In omnibus princeps&quot; (&quot;First in all things&quot;) reflects the squadron&#x27;s status as the RAF&#x27;s oldest unit, having been involved in almost every major British military operation from the First World War to the present time. These include the Second World War, Suez Crisis, Falklands War, Gulf War, Kosovo War, and Operation Telic (Iraq).

==History==
===Early years (1878–1918)===
No. 1 Squadron&#x27;s origins go back to 1878 when its predecessor, No. 1 Balloon Company, was formed at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich as part of the Balloon Section. On 1 April 1911 the Air Battalion of the Royal Engineers was created. The battalion initially consisted of two companies, with No. 1 Company, Air Battalion taking responsibility for lighter than air flying. The first Officer Commanding was Captain E. M. Maitland.

On 13 May 1912, with the establishment of the Royal Flying Corps, No. 1 Company of the Air Battalion was redesignated No. 1 Squadron, Royal Flying Corps. No. 1 Squadron was one of the original three Royal Flying Corps squadrons. Maitland continued as the new squadron&#x27;s Officer Commanding and he was promoted to major several days after the establishment of the squadron. It retained the airships &quot;Beta&quot; and &quot;Gamma&quot;, adding &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;Eta&quot;, as well as kites and a few spherical balloons. However, in October 1913 a sudden decision was made to transfer all the airships to the Naval Wing of the RFC (which became the Royal Naval Air Service by Admiralty dictat, not Cabinet decision, on 1 July 1914). While retaining kites 1 Squadron was reorganised as an &#x27;aircraft park&#x27; for the British Expeditionary Force.

On 1 May 1914, Major Charles Longcroft was appointed as the new squadron commander. Apart from a few weeks as a supernumerary in August and September 1914, Longcroft continued as the squadron commander until January 1915.

The squadron was reformed as an aircraft squadron in August 1914, and equipped with a mixture of Avro 504s and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.8s, crossed over to France on 7 March 1915, under the command of Major Geoffrey Salmond, later Chief of the Air Staff. It operated mainly in the reconnaissance role, with a few single seat fighters for escort purposes. The squadron was soon thrown into action, taking part in the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in March 1915, and moved to Balleul at the end of the month, remaining there until March 1918, operating from an airfield next to the town&#x27;s Asylum. In April–May 1915, the squadron flew reconnaissance missions during the Second Battle of Ypres. On 19 August, Salmond was replaced as commander of the squadron by Major Philip Joubert de la Ferté, later an Air Chief Marshal. By October 1915, the squadron had re-equipped with a mixture of various Morane-Saulnier types, with Morane Parasols (Types L and LA) in the Corps Reconnaissance role and Morane-Saulnier N single-seat fighters. The squadron supplemented its Parasols with more modern Morane-Saulnier P parasols and Morane-Saulnier BB biplanes in 1916, although the last LA remained with the squadron until 1917. The squadron became a dedicated fighter squadron on 1 January 1917, flying Nieuport 17s and Nieuport 27.The obsolete Nieuports were replaced by more modern S.E.5as in January 1918. On incorporation into the RAF on 1 April 1918 the squadron kept its numeral; No 1 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was displaced to become No. 201 Squadron RAF.

No. 1 Squadron had among its ranks no fewer than 31 flying aces. They include Robert A. Birkbeck, Quintin Brand (later Air Vice Marshal), Douglas Cameron, William Charles Campbell, Percy Jack Clayson, Edwin Cole, Philip Fullard (later Air Commodore), Eustace Grenfell, Louis Fleeming Jenkin, Tom Hazell, Harold Albert Kullberg, Charles Lavers, Francis Magoun, Guy Borthwick Moore, Gordon Olley, Harry Rigby, William Wendell Rogers and William Rooper.

===Interwar period (1919–1938)===
The squadron returned to the UK from France in March 1919, being formally disbanded on 20 January 1920. On the next day it reformed at Risalpur in the North West Frontier of India (now part of Pakistan), flying the Sopwith Snipe and from January 1920. It moved to Hinaidi near Baghdad in Iraq in May 1921, to carry out policing duties, retaining its Snipes, although it also received one Bristol Jupiter engined Nieuport Nighthawk for evaluation. It remained in Iraq, carrying out strafing and bombing against hostile tribal forces until November 1926 when it was disbanded.

In early 1927 it was reformed at RAF Tangmere, Sussex as a Home Defence Fighter Squadron, equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Siskin. After receiving the Hawker Fury Mk.1 in February 1932, the squadron gained a reputation for aerobatics, giving displays throughout the United Kingdom and at the Zürich International Air Meeting in July 1937, where its display impressed but it was clear that it was outclassed by the German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Dornier Do 17 also displayed at Zurich. The squadron re-equipped with the Hawker Hurricane Mk.I in October 1938.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===

On the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939 the squadron was deployed to France as part of the RAF Advanced Air Striking Force. In October it flew over enemy territory for the first time and soon claimed its first victory, shooting down a Dornier Do 17 on 31 October. Further successes were made during the Phoney War, until the Battle of France erupted in May 1940. Within a week the squadron was bombed out of its base at Berry-au-Bac, north-west of Paris. A series of retreats followed, ending only when the squadron evacuated from France on 18 June, with a return to Tangmere on 23 June.

In August 1940 the squadron entered the Battle of Britain and was heavily engaged until 9 September, when the squadron was transferred to No. 12 Group and sent to RAF Wittering to refit, rest and recuperate.

It returned to No. 11 Group in early 1941 and was employed in fighter sweeps and bomber escort duties. In February, it began &quot;Rhubarb&quot; (low-level sweeps over occupied territory) and night flying missions, and was re-equipped with the Hurricane IIA. In this period its pilots included Karel Kuttelwascher DFC, who was the RAF&#x27;s highest-scoring night intruder pilot and highest-scoring Free Czechoslovak pilot.

The squadron carried out night intruder patrols until July 1942, when it was re-equipped with the Hawker Typhoon fighter-bomber and relocated to RAF Acklington, Northumberland where it reverted to daytime operations.

The squadron was equipped with the Supermarine Spitfire Mk.IX in April 1944, and in June began anti-V1 patrols, shooting down 39 flying bombs. Missions were also flown over the Falaise Gap, strafing targets of opportunity. Later in the year it reverted to bomber escort duties, based at Maldegem. It was involved in supporting Operation Market Garden : the parachute drops into the Netherlands, and later in support of the Allied counter-offensive in the Ardennes. The squadron dropped 250 lb bombs on to &#x27;Key Points&#x27; (KPs), directed by radar to counter the adverse weather conditions. In May 1945 it converted to the Spitfire Mk.XXI, but these were only used operationally to cover landings on the Channel Islands.

===Post-war (1946–1968)===
In 1946, the Squadron returned to Tangmere and took delivery of its first jet aircraft, the Gloster Meteor. In October 1948, Major Robin Olds, USAF, under the U.S. Air Force/Royal Air Force exchange program, was posted in and flying the Gloster Meteor jet fighter. He eventually served as commander of the Squadron at RAF Station Tangmere, an unusual posting for a non-commonwealth foreigner in peacetime.

The Squadron was then equipped with the Hawker Hunter F.5, which were flown from RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus during the 1956 Suez Crisis. The squadron disbanded on 23 June 1958. However, on 1 July 1958 the squadron was reformed by re-numbering No. 263 Squadron at RAF Stradishall. It then moved to RAF Waterbeach from where, flying the Hunter FGA.9, it operated in the ground attack role as part of No. 38 Group. The Squadron continued in this role for the next eight years, operating out of Waterbeach and then RAF West Raynham. Flight Lieutenant Alan Pollock of No. 1 Squadron was responsible for the infamous and very unofficial flying display on the 50th anniversary of the RAF in 1968.

===Harrier (1969–2011)===

Under the command of Squadron Leader Bryan Baker, the squadron became the world&#x27;s first operator of a V/STOL aircraft with the arrival of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier in 1969, declared operational the following year. A detachment from No. 1 Squadron was deployed aboard the Carrier Battle Group (TG 317.8) of the Falklands Task Force during the Falklands War, operating from HMS &quot;Hermes&quot; and flying ground attack missions against Argentine forces. It replaced its first generation Harriers with Harrier IIs from 23 November 1988, being declared fully operational on the Harrier GR.5 on 2 November 1989. The squadron was the subject of an episode of the BBC documentary series &quot;Defence of the Realm&quot; before and during its participation in the Bosnian War as part of NATO&#x27;s &quot;Operation Deny Flight&quot;. During the Kosovo war the Squadron flew sorties as part of NATO&#x27;s Operation Allied Force.

No. 1 Squadron left the &quot;home of the Harrier&quot; at RAF Wittering for RAF Cottesmore on 28 July 2000. Cottesmore became home to all operational RAF Harrier squadrons – No. 20 (Reserve) Squadron, later renumbered as No. 4 (R) Squadron, the Harrier Operational Conversion Unit remained at Wittering. The squadrons both flew missions during the Iraq War and were awarded the &quot;Iraq 2003&quot; battle honour.

The squadron was awarded a battle honour in March 2020, recognising its role in the War in Afghanistan.

One outcome of the Strategic Defence and Security Review by the coalition government in 2010 was the decision to take the RAF&#x27;s Harriers out of service almost immediately. All Harrier units, including No. 1 (F) Squadron, ceased Harrier flying on 15 December 2010, with No. 1 (F) Squadron formally disbanding on 28 January 2011.

===Typhoon (2012–present)===

On 15 September 2012, the squadron reformed on the Eurofighter Typhoon at RAF Leuchars. The squadron participated in multiple exercises in foreign countries including Exercise Shaheen Star in the United Arab Emirates during January 2013 and Exercise Bersama Shield in Malaysia during March 2013.

On 8 September 2014, No. 1 (F) Squadron relocated to RAF Lossiemouth, to operate alongside No. 6 and XV (R) squadrons, as well as &quot;D&quot; Flight, No. 202 Squadron (SAR) and No. 5 Force Protection Wing.

On 14 November 2019 the squadron deployed 4 fighters to Keflavik Air Base as part of the NATO Air Policing, Iceland. The squadron also deployed an additional 100 personnel to support the squadron and forces based in Iceland.
