<text>Thirlmere is a reservoir in the Cumberland district in Cumbria and the English Lake District. The Helvellyn ridge lies to the east of Thirlmere. To the west of Thirlmere are a number of fells; for instance, Armboth Fell and Raven Crag both of which give views of the lake and of Helvellyn beyond.

The reservoir runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side for much of its length by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of a former natural lake: this had a fordable waist so narrow that it was (and is) sometimes regarded as two lakes. In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating a reservoir to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct.

The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area, but under the Water Act 1973 ownership passed to the North West Water Authority; as a result of subsequent privatisation and amalgamation they (and the catchment area surrounding the reservoir) are now owned and managed by United Utilities, a private sector water and wastewater company.

==The natural lake==
We now approached the lake of Wyburn, or Thirlmer, as it is sometimes called; an object every way suited to the ideas of desolation which surround it, No tufted verdure graces banks, nor hanging woods throw rich reflections on surface: but every form which it suggests, is savage, and desolate. 
Before the construction of the reservoir there was a smaller natural lake, known by various names including Leathes Water, Wythburn Water Thirle Water, and Thirlmere. (The Leathes were the lords of the manor, the valley in which the lake sat was Wythburndale (after the hamlet of Wythburn at its head), &#x27;Thirlmere&#x27; probably is derived from &quot; &#x27;the lake with/at the narrowing&#x27; from OE &quot;þyrel&quot; &#x27;aperture&#x27;, pierced hole&#x27; plus OE &quot;mere&quot; &#x27;lake&#x27;&quot;) The Ordnance Survey six-inch map of 1867 shows a single lake (Thirlmere) with its narrowest point at Wath Bridge roughly level with Armboth; at this point &quot;The water is shallow and crossed by a bridge, so that piers are easily built and connected with little wooden bridges, and that difficult problem in engineering - crossing a lake - accomplished&quot; and the map shows both a bridge and a ford between the west and east banks. (&#x27;Wath&#x27; = &#x27;ford&#x27; in Cumbrian placenames: the &#x27;Bridge&#x27; itself can be seen in a photograph of the pre-reservoir valley: it was repeatedly carried away by floods (e.g. in November 1861.))

Because of this constriction there were &quot;practically at low water two lakes, the river connecting them being crossed at the Narrows by a little wood and stone bridge&quot;, and the natural lake is sometimes characterised as two lakes. The stream exiting the lake (St John&#x27;s Beck) flowed north to the River Greta, which flowed west through Keswick to join the Cumbrian Derwent.

==The &#x27;Thirlmere scheme&#x27;==
===Use as a reservoir suggested===

In 1863, a pamphlet urged that Thirlmere and Haweswater should be made reservoirs, and their water conveyed (via Ullswater (used as a distributing reservoir)) 240 miles to London to supply it with two hundred million gallons a day of clean water; the cost of the project was put at ten million pounds. The scheme was considered by a Royal Commission on Water Supply chaired by the Duke of Richmond, but its report of 1869 dismissed such long-distance schemes, preferring to supply London by pumping from aquifers and abstraction from the Thames. The scheme continued to be proposed; by 1876, it had grown to include a branch feeder from Bala Lake and the cost had risen accordingly to £m 13.5; however nothing ever came of it.

The original scope specified for the Duke of Richmond&#x27;s royal commission had been the water supply of London &quot;and other large cities&quot;, but the commission had found itself fully occupied by consideration of the metropolitan water supply. For water supply elsewhere, its report had merely made general recommendations: ... that no town or district should be allowed to appropriate a source of supply which naturally and geographically belongs to a town or district nearer to such source, unless under special circumstances which justify the appropriation. 
That when any town or district is supplied by a line or conduit from a distance, provision ought to be made for the supply of all places along such lines. 
That on the introduction of any provincial water bill into Parliament, attention should be drawn to the practicability of making the measure applicable to as extensive a district as possible, and not merely to the particular town.

===Manchester looks to Thirlmere===
The corporations of both Manchester and Liverpool had already constructed a series of reservoirs to support their growth (Liverpool at Rivington, Manchester at Longdendale) but saw no possibility of further reservoirs there. Concerned that their existing water supplies would be rendered inadequate by their growth, they were now seeking further supplies: to comply with the royal commission&#x27;s &quot;no poaching&quot; recommendation any further reservoirs would have to be much further afield. In 1875 John Frederick Bateman suggested that Manchester and Liverpool should supply themselves with water from Haweswater and Ullswater (made reservoirs) as a joint undertaking. Both Liverpool and Manchester corporations rejected this, feeling that the interests of their cities required their water supplies to be independent of any other city. Instead in 1877, Liverpool initiated a scheme for a reservoir on the headwaters of the Vyrnwy in North Wales; at the instigation of their chairman (a native of Cumberland with a second home at Portinscale on Derwentwater), the Waterworks Committee of Manchester Corporation proposed to supply Manchester with water from a Thirlmere reservoir. 
In their report to the full council, it was noted that water consumption had been 8 million gallons a day in 1855, 11 million gallons a day in 1865, in 1874 18 million gallons a day on average with peak demand 21 million gallons a day. The reliable supply from the Longdendale reservoirs in periods of drought was only 25 million gallons per day, but in the last two years, demand had increased by 2.4 million gallons a day. Demand therefore was predicted to exceed the reliable supply in about seven years; it would take at least that to bring any major additional water supply on stream. Any major new works should aim to secure adequate supplies for the next thirty or fifty years; these could only be found in the mountains and lakes of northern Lancashire, Westmorland or Cumberland. Only Ullswater, Haweswater and Thirlmere were high enough to supply Manchester by gravity flow; the natural drainage of all three was to the north, but Thirlmere lay immediately below the pass of Dunmail Raise and the engineering to bring its waters south of the watershed would be significantly easier than for (for example) Ullswater. Thirlmere water had been analysed by Professor Roscoe who pronounced it superior even to that of Loch Katrine and thus one of the best waters known.

Speaking to the report, the chairman of the Waterworks Committee noted that the catchment area was over 11,000 acres (in which there were not more than 200 inhabitants) and the annual rainfall about 110 inches; fifty million gallons a day could be collected and sent to Manchester; unlike the massive dams in Longdendale, all that was needed was a wall fifty-foot high across a gorge he could throw a stone across. As regards aesthetic objections:

The report had predicted little opposition to the scheme, by which it asserted the &quot;beauty of the lake will be rather enhanced than otherwise&quot;. Other councillors were less sure of this, one noting that:

===The Thirlmere Defence Association===

To protect the purity of Thirlmere water, Manchester Corporation set about buying up all the land in its catchment area; the price it offered was such that there was little truly local opposition to the scheme. In Keswick, the nearest town, over 90% of ratepayers signed a petition in favour (Keswick had suffered repeatedly from flooding after heavy rainfall in the Thirlmere area). To the south, the only town council in Westmorland (Kendal) voted to support the scheme (hoping that a supply from the aqueduct would be a cheaper solution to their water supply problems than the new waterworks which would otherwise be needed): a local paper noted that &quot;the inhabitants of Westmorland are not much alarmed at it …so far they have stolidly refused to lose their tempers, or even waste many words over it&quot;. At a meeting to form a Lake District Association to promote tourism in the region, it was quickly agreed not to take a view on the Thirlmere scheme; otherwise the association would break up before it was fairly started.

The aqueduct, however, was objected to by owners of land through which it would pass: under normal procedure, they would be the only objectors with sufficient &quot;locus standi&quot; to be heard against the private bill necessary to authorise the scheme. Those who objected to the change in the appearance (as they saw it, destruction of the beauty) of the lake would be unable to demonstrate any financial interest in the matter. They therefore needed to stop the project by mobilising opinion against the scheme; in 1876 this – together with economic hard times – had seen off a scheme to link the existing railheads at Keswick and Windermere by a railway running alongside Thirlmere.

&quot;If every person who has visited the Lake District, in a true nature-loving spirit would be ready, when the right time comes, to sign an indignant protest against the scheme, surely there might be some hope...&quot; that Parliament would reject the bill, urged one correspondent, who went on to urge legal protection for natural beauty, along the lines of that proposed for ancient monuments by Sir John Lubbock or for the Yellowstone area in the United States. Octavia Hill called for a committee to organise (and collect funds for) an effective opposition. A meeting at Grasmere in September 1877, considered a report on the Thirlmere scheme from H J Marten CE and formed a Thirlmere Defence Association (TDA) with over £1,000 of subscriptions pledged. By February 1878, members of the TDA included Thomas Carlyle, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, Thomas Woolner R.A., John Gilbert R.A. and Derwent Coleridge.

Aesthetic opposition to the scheme was aggravated by the suggestion that Manchester Corporation would improve on nature and varied in tone and thoughtfulness: the Carlisle Patriot thought Manchester welcome to take all the water it needed, provided only that it must not &quot;destroy or deface those natural features which constitute the glory of the Lake District&quot; and advised against any attempt to mitigate the offence by tree-planting; Thirlmere had &quot;..a character of its own which makes the suggested artificiality intolerable. The rocky walls that hem it in boast no verdure: wild precipices, grand in the austerity of their barrenness cast their reflections on the mere, and by their wildness scout the municipal device of decoration..&quot; 
John Ruskin denounced Manchester in general I am quite aware that there are many amiable persons in Manchester - and much general intelligence. But, taken as a whole, I perceive that Manchester can produce no good art, and no good literature; it is falling off even in the quality of its cotton; it has reversed, and vilified in loud lies, every essential principle of political economy; it is cowardly in war, predatory in peace... and thought it would be more just if instead of Manchester Corporation being allowed to &quot;steal and sell for a profit the water of Thirlmere and clouds of Hevellyn&quot; it should be drowned in Thirlmere. The Mancunian press thought it detected a similar (if less blatant) prejudice and an &#x27;essentially Cockney agitation&#x27; when papers such as the Pall Mall Gazette editorialised &quot;The visible universe was not created merely to supply materials towards the manufacture of shoddy&quot; 

Speaking at the opening of the new Town Hall in Manchester, the Bishop of Manchester declared himself surprised at the language of the scheme&#x27;s opponents, many of whom, he thought, had no idea where Thirlmere was but although he thought their aesthetic judgement wrong his counter-argument was not aesthetic, but political ..one man in eight was interested more or less in the vital interests of Manchester, and he thought when some of the carpings which dainty clubmen in London indulged in at their expense - that they had no right to take water from a Cumberland or Westmorland lake - he thought they had a right to stand up and claim their inheritance, and to claim that two millions of people had a right to the necessaries of life from any portion of England.

===Private bill of 1878===

Manchester gave the required notice of its forthcoming bill in November 1877. It sought powers to dam the outflow from Thirlmere and to divert into it a number of neighbouring gills which did not already drain into it, to build an aqueduct from Thirlmere to Manchester, and to extract water from Thirlmere. In addition, a section of the existing Keswick-Ambleside turnpike north of Wythburn was to be diverted to run at a higher level, and a new carriage road was to be built on the western side of Thirlmere. Compulsory purchase powers were sought to allow these works to be carried out and to allow Manchester Corporation to buy and keep land in the Thirlmere catchment area.

In response, the TDA issued a statement of its case. The scheme would destroy the distinctive charm of Thirlmere which was &#x27;entirely free from modern erections out of harmony with the surroundings&#x27;; raising the level would destroy the many small bays that gave the west shore its character, the &#x27;picturesque windings&#x27; of the existing road on the east side were to be replaced by a dead level road, at the northern end, &#x27;one of the sweetest glens in Cumberland&#x27; was to be the site of an enormous embankment. Worst of all, in a dry season, the lake would be drawn down to its old level, exposing over three hundred acres of &#x27;oozy mud and rotting vegetation&#x27;. &quot;Few persons, whose taste is not utterly uneducated, are likely to share the confidence of the water committee in their power to enhance the loveliness of such a scene, or will think that the boldest devices of engineering skill will be other than a miserable substitute for the natural beauties they displace.&quot; 
Furthermore, the scheme was unnecessary: Manchester already had an ample supply of water; its apparent consumption was so high because it was selling water to industrial users, and to areas outside Manchester and Manchester sought to increase such sales because they were profitable. Manchester could easily get more (and of superior quality) from wells tapping the New Red Sandstone aquifer; if they were still unsatisfied there were vast untouched collecting grounds in the moorlands of Lancashire. There was also a more general point; the Thirlmere scheme, if approved, would set a precedent for municipalities to buy up whole valleys in the Lake District, leaving them at the mercy of &quot;bodies of men, skilful and diligent enough in managing local affairs, but having little capacity to appreciate the importance of subjects beyond their daily sphere of action&quot; with painful consequences for their natural beauty.

====Second Reading debate====
In January 1878, Edward Howard, the MP for East Cumberland who had given notice of a motion calling for a select committee looking at the problems of water supply to Lancashire and Yorkshire (which would have prevented progress of the Thirlmere Bill until the select committee had reported), announced that he would delay introducing the motion until the Thirlmere Bill had been defeated at second reading. Normally, private bills were not opposed at Second Reading; their success or failure was determined by the committee stage which followed. However, when the Second Reading of the Thirlmere Bill was moved, Howard spoke against it, and was supported by William Lowther, MP for Westmorland. Two Manchester MPs spoke for the bill, as did the MP for Cockermouth, Isaac Fletcher, a West Cumberland mine-owner and industrialist. The Chairman of Ways and Means said it was impossible that the bill could be considered by an ordinary private bill committee, and suggested that it should be referred to a Hybrid Committee, where &quot;persons might be examined who have not those sharply-defined interests which are usually represented before a private committee. Such a Committee might consider this question through all its bearings, public as well as private; and they might, at all events, lay down a principle for the guidance of the House in dealing with future questions connected with the water supply of populous districts.&quot; Only if this was promised could he vote for the Second Reading; other speakers followed his lead, and it was on this basis that the bill then passed its Second Reading.

====Committee stage====
The bill was considered by a committee chaired by Lyon Playfair: its terms of reference were (bulleting added for clarity) 
* to inquire into, and report upon the present sufficiency of the water supply of Manchester and its neighbourhood, and of any other sources available for such supply; 
* to consider whether permission should be given to make use of any of the Westmoreland and Cumberland lakes for the purpose, and if so, how far and under what conditions, to consider the prospective requirements of the populations situated between the lake district and Manchester;
* to inquire, and report, whether any, and, if so, what, provisions should be made in limitation of proposals for the exclusive use of the water of any of the said lakes

=====Manchester&#x27;s case=====
Manchester fielded a legal team headed by Sir Edmund Beckett QC, a leading practitioner at the parliamentary bar: they called witnesses to make the case for the scheme. Manchester waterworks supplied an area containing 800,000 inhabitants, about 380,000 of whom lived within the city boundary. In dry summers, the water supply had to be cut off at night to conserve stocks. In 1868, admittedly before the works in Longdendale were complete, this had happened for 75 days. Water consumption was about 22 gallons a day per person, but it was that low because Manchester had discouraged water-closets and baths in working-class housing The waterworks did not make a profit; by an act of Parliament the total water rate could not exceed 10d per pound rental within the city; 12d in the supplied area outside the city (to have equal rates would be unfair to the rate payers who stood as guarantors for very large capital expenditure) Manchester was not profiteering from its present water supply, nor was it out to profit from the scheme: it would accept whatever obligation to supply areas along the aqueduct route (and/or price cap on sales outside the city) the committee saw fit to impose.
There was no possibility of adding further reservoirs in Longdendale and no suitable unclaimed sites south of the Lune; the headwaters of the Lune were in limestone country, making both water quality (soft water was preferred by domestic customers and needed for textile processing) and reservoir construction problematical. Thirlmere water was exceptionally pure whereas water pumped from the sandstone even when drinkable generally had considerable permanent hardness
Taking water from Ullswater rather than Thirlmere would cost about £370,000 more. Thirlmere had higher rainfall than Longdendale (even in the driest year, 72 inches should be expected) and (by raising the water level) storage sufficient to allow the supply of fifty million gallons a day through any reasonably sustained drought: the reliable supply from Longdendale was only half that. The aqueduct to Manchester would (at different points on its route) be a tunnel through rock, a buried culvert constructed by cut-and-cover, or cast-iron pipes (for example where the aqueduct crossed a river, it would normally do so by an inverted syphon in pipes). Five 40-inch diameter pipes would be provided to take the full fifty million gallons per day, but initially only one pipe would be laid – others would be added as demand increased.

The former secretary of the Duke of Richmond&#x27;s Royal Commission gave evidence of the scheme they had considered, which involved raising the level of Thirlmere 64 feet. Examination of the area around the outlet showed that Thirlmere had previously overflowed at a level 65 feet higher than at present.
 Hence &quot;it would only be necessary to dam up the present outlet ... to raise the lake to its original level&quot;; were this done &quot;the lake when filled will be more in keeping with the grandeur of the hills around&quot; Variations in reservoir water level would only expose a gravel or shingle shore (as happened now with natural fluctuations in level): there was nothing in the water to support the formation of mudbanks. The commission had thought it would be unreasonable for London to take water from the Lakes without considering the needs of the industrial North; it had remarked favourably on Manchester supplying nearby towns as an instance of how by combination small towns might secure a better supply than they could by their own efforts. The same principle applied to supplying towns on the route of the aqueduct.

=====Independent witnesses=====
A number of independent witnesses were then called by the committee. Professor Ramsay, Director-General of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, confirmed the previous higher level of the lake: Playfair said he considered the evidence of the &#x27;degradation of the lake by the gorge being opened&#x27; most important. Robert Rawlinson, chief engineering inspector to the Local Government Board favoured the Thirlmere scheme (thirty years earlier he had proposed a similar scheme to supply Liverpool from Bala Lake) and vouched for the competence of Bateman.

=====Opposition on aesthetic grounds=====
After calling witnesses with a straightforward &quot;locus standi&quot; under Private Bill standing orders and hearing their objections (detriment to salmon fishing in the Greta if floods and spates were eliminated, the dangers to gentlemen&#x27;s residences from aqueduct bursts, interference of the aqueduct with natural drainage, and the undesirable disturbance from constructing the aqueduct through gentlemen&#x27;s private pleasure grounds (and doing so on five occasions where pipes were used).) witnesses with aesthetic objections were heard. A Stourbridge solicitor owning a house and 160 acres in Grasmere objected to the trace of the aqueduct as &#x27;a great scar on the landscape&#x27;; he had laid out £1000 on building roads on his land in hopes of selling plots for the construction of houses: &#x27;you may build houses without disfiguring the district&#x27;, but the aqueduct would destroy the essential local feature of the district.

A Keswick bank manager objected because the dam would be vulnerable to a waterspout, experienced in St John&#x27;s Vale many times. He was supported by William Wordsworth (the only surviving son of the poet) who spoke of waterspouts at Rydal, and went on to object that raising the level of Thirlmere would remove its natural indentations: repeated attempts by him to dilate on the lake&#x27;s associations with the Lake Poets were treated unsympathetically by counsel for Manchester and eventually ended by the committee chairman. Witnesses then testified to Thirlmere having a muddy bottom (but one said it was only found at more than twelve feet down.) The brother (and heir) of the lord of the manor gave evidence that the beauty of Thirlmere lay in it being more secluded than other lakes: his counsel used his examination to suggest that Manchester Corporation was buying excessive amounts of land with a view to selling off building plots should the waterworks scheme be defeated.

A Grasmere villa-owner likened the scheme to &#x27;some modern Cockney&#x27; daubing paint on a picture in the National Gallery and claiming it to be an improvement; he predicted stinking mud around the edges of Thirlmere because that was what found around Grasmere. W E Forster held both that if Manchester needed water and could get it nowhere other than Thirlmere, the scheme should go ahead; but that - if it did - beauty more valuable than any picture that was or was to come would be lost to the people of England, who would not be recompensed by any amount of compensation to landed proprietors: Parliament should ensure that beauty was not lost unnecessarily. (Forster was not only a prominent politician with a house near Ambleside, but also a partner in a West Riding worsted manufacturer, and Beckett pressed him on why the generation of dust and smoke and &#x27;turning rivers into ink&#x27; in the valleys of the West Riding was not in greater need of Parliamentary scrutiny than raising the level of Thirlmere was.)

=====Need for the Thirlmere scheme questioned=====
Manchester&#x27;s current and future needs for water were then disputed, the adequacy of the Thirlmere scheme queried, and alternative schemes for increasing the supply of water to Manchester suggested. Edward Hull, director of the Irish section of the Geological Survey, gave evidence on the ready availability of water from the New Red Sandstone aquifer around Manchester. He estimated that one square mile could yield 139,000 gallons a day; a single well would give up to two million gallons a day. The Delamere Forest region, 25 miles from Manchester, had 126 square miles of the sandstone and was untapped: it should be possible to extract 16,500,000 gallons a day from it. George Symons gave evidence on rainfall. He predicted that in the driest year, the rainfall at Thirlmere would be no more than 60 inches; about ten inches of this would be lost in evaporation, and Manchester were promising to maintain flows down St John&#x27;s Beck equivalent to another nine inches. In cross-examination he conceded that he had had a rain gauge at Thirlmere since 1866 and the lowest annual rainfall it had recorded was 82 inches; re-examined he thought Manchester could not get 50 million gallons a day from Thirlmere; the most they could rely upon was 25 million gallons a day. Alderman King, the only Manchester alderman to have voted against the scheme, reported that since 1874 the water consumption had decreased and in his opinion Manchester&#x27;s present supply was adequate for the next ten years. He pointed out that Bateman had originally suggested using Ullswater, rather than Thirlmere, as a reservoir, and had at the start of the Longdendale scheme been over-optimistic in his estimate of its cost and yield; he therefore thought the Thirlmere scheme imprudent from the point of view of Manchester ratepayers.

Henry Marten MICE thought that Manchester&#x27;s high consumption in the early 1870s had been due to wastage; his calculations were that it would be fifteen years before Manchester needed more water. When it did, it could increase reservoir capacity in Longdendale; much of the rain falling there currently ran to waste. It might also be prudent to reduce the amount of &#x27;compensation water&#x27; released from the Longdendale reservoirs to feed mills downstream, and to have contingency arrangements to pump water from the sandstone aquifer in time of drought He also objected to Manchester claiming so productive a source of water for itself, and doubted if it would deal fairly with other towns wanting Thirlmere water; if it did, the scheme would be of general public benefit. Playfair &#x27;perhaps speaking more as a sanitarian&#x27; queried whether Liverpool was so sanitary a town as to be a good example of how Manchester might reduce consumption, and whether the existing restrictions on consumption in Manchester should not eased by increasing the water supply: Marten disagreed (if Liverpool was insanitary, it was because of the presence of foreigners, it being a seaport.)

=====Alternative sources suggested=====
Edward Easton agreed with Marten that the restrictions on consumption in Manchester were not too stringent and was astonished at Bateman&#x27;s claim that there were no further suitable reservoir sites in Longdendale; in one weekend he had identified four or five suitable sites. After Longdendale there were other possible sites, amongst many others those on the headwaters of the Derbyshire Derwent Thomas Fenwick gave evidence on the practicality of using reservoirs on the Derwent, but had to admit that he did so based on the work of a one-weekend visit to the area, that the Derwent catchment area did not naturally belong to Manchester, and that the Derwent flowed past Chatsworth so any interference with its natural flow would have to be agreeable to the Duke of Devonshire. The Derwent valley was almost as beautiful as the lakes, but lacked a lake; its beauty would be improved by a reservoir. Aqueducts (like one he had built for Dewsbury) were scarcely visible once built, and much more care was now taken in the construction of dams; dam failure was a thing of the past.

Playfair declined the offer of further evidence from Manchester on getting water from the Derwent catchment area, as its proponents had given no real detail, nor any notice to potential objectors: a brief comment by Bateman would suffice.
Bateman was then re-examined on the possibility of increasing storage at Longdendale. Easton&#x27;s suggestion of additional sites was &#x27;utterly absurd&#x27;; all practicable sites were already taken: &quot;He had been working in these valleys for nearly thirty years, and he thought he knew something more about them than a man who made a galloping journey over them in one day&quot;. Taking water from the Derwent catchment area would require a nine-mile-long tunnel, and cost nearly as much as Thirlmere for half the yield.

=====Closing submissions=====
Counsel for the TDA conceded that if Manchester needed the water, then it must have it; but it had been shown the beauty of the lake would be greatly damaged, and therefore Manchester needed to show that there was no other way to meet its needs: it was not for the objectors to provide a worked-up alternative scheme. It had been shown there was no necessity; Manchester would not need more water for many years to come. The scheme had been brought forward to gratify the ambition of Manchester Corporation and Mr Bateman, its engineer. In purchasing land around Thirlmere they had exceeded their powers, as they had done for many years by supplying water outside their district, as though they were a commercial water company, not a municipal undertaking. Bateman&#x27;s calculations were based upon aiming to fully meet demand in a dry year, but failure to do so would cause only temporary inconvenience: one might as well build a railway entirely in a tunnel to ensure the line would not be blocked by snow. In any case, more storage could be provided in Longdendale and the Derwent headwaters, and more water could be extracted from the sandstone.

He was followed by counsel for various local authorities, arguing against the Bill being passed without it laying any obligation on Manchester to supply water at a reasonable price to neighbouring authorities and to districts through which the aqueduct passed. As counsel for the TDA objected, these &#x27;objectors&#x27; were - in everything but name - supporters of the scheme speaking in favour of it.

Beckett began by attacking the aesthetic issue head-on. He objected to the false sentimentality of &quot;people calling themselves learned, refined, and aesthetical, and thinking nobody had a right to an opinion but themselves&quot;, and in particular to Forster who thought himself entitled to talk about national sentiment and British interests as though there were no two views of the case. The lake had been higher in the past, and there was no good reason to think it would not look better covering 800 acres than covering 350. Forster talked of Parliament interfering to protect natural beauty, just as it interfered to protect the commons, but the analogy failed: Forster wanted to interfere (on the basis of &#x27;national sentiment&#x27;) with the right of people to do they saw fit with their own property; this was communism. Forster was not even consistent: he saw no need for Parliament to have powers to prevent woollen mills being built at Thirlmere, and turning its waters as inky as the Wharfe. Aesthetics disposed of, the case became a simple one. Manchester was not undertaking the project because it loved power: nothing in the Bill increased its supply area by a single acre; it sold water to other authorities because Parliament expected it to; it was nonsense to suggest that the town clerk of Manchester needed instruction on the legality of doing so. It was clear that the population of South Lancashire would continue to increase; it was absurd for counsel for the TDA to object to this as an unwarranted assumption upon which the argument that Manchester would need more water in the foreseeable future rested. As for the suggestion that more water might be got in Longdendale, this rested on overturning the settled views of an engineer with thirty years experience in the valley by a last-minute survey lasting under thirty hours by Mr Easton, whose conduct was shameful and scandalous. Other schemes had been floated; the Derwent, the Cheshire sandstone, but they were too hypothetical to be relied upon. The Thirlmere scheme, which by its boldness ensured cheap and plentiful water to South Lancashire for years to come, was the right solution. If it was rejected, Manchester would not pursue &#x27;little schemes here and there, giving little sups of water&#x27;; they would wait until Parliament was of their turn of mind.

====Committee findings and loss of Bill====
The committee agreed unanimously to pass the bill in principle, provided introduction of a clause allowing for arbitration on aesthetic issues on the line of the aqueduct, and of one requiring bulk supply of water (at a fair price) to towns and local authorities demanding it, if they were near the aqueduct (with Manchester and its supply area having first call on up to 25 gallons per head of population from Thirlmere and Longdendale combined.) Suitable clauses having been inserted, the committee stage of the bill was successfully completed 4 April 1878. The report of the committee said that
* Manchester was justified in seeking additional sources of supply; there were already nearly a million inhabitants of its statutory supply area and a shortfall could arise within ten years. It would be unwise to expect any increase in the supply from Longdendale. The Derwent scheme was too costly (and given in insufficient detail) to require consideration, and it would be unjust to other Lancashire towns to allow Manchester to appropriate catchment areas closer than the Lakes.
* Thirlmere was of great natural beauty. Formation of the reservoir would restore the lake to a former level; characteristic features would be lost, but new ones would be formed. The purchase of the land in the catchment area (with a view to preventing mines and villas) would preserve its natural state for generations to come; the construction of roads would make its beauty more accessible to the public. Fluctuations in level (except in prolonged drought) would not be significantly greater than the current natural variation, and (the margin of the lake being shingle, not mud) would be unimportant. Hence, &quot;the water of Lake Thirlmere could be used without detriment to the public enjoyment of the lake&quot;. As for the aqueduct, beyond temporary inconvenience and unsightliness during construction, there would be little or no permanent injury to the scenery.
* the interest of water authorities on or near the line of the aqueduct in securing a supply of water from it had been considered. In accordance with the recommendation of the Richmond Commission, an appropriate clause had been inserted, and the preamble of the bill adjusted accordingly.
The Bill received its Third Reading in the Commons 10 May 1878 (the TDA, however, appealing to its supporters for £2,000 to fund further opposition in the Lords.) The TDA then objected that the Bill, as it left the Commons, did not meeting the standing orders of the House of Lords, as the required notice had not been given of the new clauses. This objection was upheld, and the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Lords therefore rejected the Bill.

===Bill of 1879===
Manchester returned with another Thirlmere Bill in the next session: the council&#x27;s decision to do so was endorsed by a town meeting and, when called for by opponents, a vote of ratepayers (43,362 votes for; 3524 against) The 1879 bill as first advertised was essentially the 1878 bill as it had left the Commons, with some additional concessions to the TDA (most notably that Thirlmere was never to be drawn down below its natural pre-reservoir level) being made later. In February 1879, Edward Howard introduced a motion calling for a select committee looking at the problems of water supply to Lancashire and Yorkshire (which would have prevented progress of the Thirlmere Bill until the select C
committee had reported). In doing so, he criticised (without prior notice) the conduct of the hybrid committee of 1878.

The President of the Local Government Board thought a royal commission unnecessary (much information had already been gathered and was freely available), and Howard&#x27;s motion was too transparently an attempt to block the Thirlmere Bill. Forster regretted the decision of the hybrid committee, but it had been an able committee, and its conclusions should be respected. Playfair also defended the committee; it had (as required by the Commons) carefully examined the regional and public interest issues which a royal commission was now supposedly needed to re-examine properly. As a result of this, a clause had been introduced which made the bill effectively a public one; the Lords had then refused to consider the bill because the additional clauses fell foul of requirements for a purely private bill. Howard withdrew his motion. At committee stage, the preamble was unopposed and the only objector against the clauses was unsuccessful. Committee stage was completed 25 March 1879; the same objection was made at the Lords select committee, and was again unsuccessful; the bill received royal assent in May 1879.; it became Manchester Corporation Waterworks Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. xxxvi).

==Conversion to Manchester&#x27;s reservoir==
===The scheme on pause===
The act set no time limit for completion of the work, but the compulsory purchase powers it gave were to expire at the end of 1886. There was no immediate shortage of water, and it was decided to undertake no engineering until purchasing of property and way-leaves was essentially complete. However, these were not pursued with any great urgency (especially after the replacement of the chairman of the waterworks committee, Alderman Grave), and 1884 Grave began a series of letters to the press calling for greater urgency. He was answered by Alderman King, long opposed to the scheme, who urged that it be dropped, pointing out that in 1881 the average daily consumption of water had been under 19 million gallons a day, less than 2 million gallons a day more than in 1875; on that basis not until 1901 would average daily consumption reach the limits of supply from Longdendale. In turn, Bateman (complaining &quot;Where almost every statement is incorrect, and the conclusions, therefore, fallacious, it is difficult within any reasonable compass to deal with all&quot;) responded: the reassuring calculation reflected a recent period of trade depression and wet summers; the question was not of the average consumption over the year, but of the ability of supply and storage to meet demand in a hot and dry summer; as professional adviser to the water committee he would not have dared incurred the risk of failing to do so by delaying the start of work for so long. The waterworks committee steered a middle course; the Thirlmere scheme was not to be lost sight of, they argued in July 1884, but – in view of the current trade depression – it should not be unduly hastened.

The summer of 1884 was, however, one of prolonged drought. At the start of July, after three months with little rain, there was still 107 days supply in the reservoirs; by the start of October there was no more than 21 days: &quot;The great reservoirs… are, with one or two exceptions, empty - literally dry. The banks are parched, the beds of the huge basins are in many places sufficiently hard owing to the long continued absence of water to enable one to walk from one side to the other, or from end to end, almost without soiling one&#x27;s boots.&quot;
Furthermore, the water drawn down from the reservoirs had had &#x27;a disagreeable and most offensive odour&#x27; The drought broke in October; it had lasted a month longer than that of 1868, but the water supply had not had to be turned off at night; the waterworks committee thought the council could congratulate itself on this but in January 1885 the committee sought, and the council (despite further argument by Alderman King) gave permission to commence the Thirlmere works.

===Construction work===

The first phase was to construct the aqueduct with a capacity of ten thousand gallons a day, and to raise the level of Thirlmere by damming up its natural exit to the north. The engineer for the project was George Hill (formerly an assistant, and then partner of Bateman). Contracts for the aqueduct went out for tender in autumn 1885; by April 1886 excavation of the tunnels had begun and hutted camps had sprung up (at White Moss, and elsewhere) to house the army of navvies (who were paid 4d an hour): The original contractor suspended work in February 1887, and the contract had to be re-let. A further bill (supported by the Lake District Defence Society and Canon Rawnsley) was contemplated for 1889 to allow Thirlmere to be raised only 20 ft in the first instance, and defer improvement of the road on the west side of the lake but was not proceeded with. Boring of the tunnel under Dunmail Raise was completed in July 1890, and work then began on the dam at the north end of Thirlmere. There were then between five and six thousand men working on the Thirlmere project.

Before any supply from Thirlmere became available, there were two dry summers during which Manchester experienced a &#x27;water famine&#x27;. The summer of 1887 was the driest for years, with stocks falling to 14 days&#x27; supply in early August, and the water supply consequently being cut off from 6 pm to 6 am. Stocks at the start of 1888 were markedly lower than in previous years, and as early as March 1888 the water supply was again cut off overnight (8pm-5am), but spring rain soon allowed a resumption of the constant supply. 1893 saw another dry summer, with stocks falling to twenty-four days&#x27; supply by the start of September and that – a councillor complained – of inferior quality with &#x27;an abundance of animal life visible to the naked eye&#x27; in tap water. By now, the aqueduct and dam were complete, but under the 1879 Act the roads around Thirlmere had to be completed before any water could be taken from it. The summer of 1894 was wet, and starting to use Thirlmere water would mean charges of £10,000 a year; the opening was therefore delayed until October 1894. There were two opening ceremonies; one at Thirlmere followed next day in Manchester by the turning-on of water to a fountain in Albert Square.

==Thirlmere as Manchester&#x27;s reservoir==
===First phase: 10 million gallons a day, lake 20 ft above natural===
For the next ten years, the level of Thirlmere was twenty feet above that of the old lake: lowland pasturage was lost, but little housing. The straight level road on the east bank was favourably commented upon in accounts of cycling tours of the lakes, and it was widely thought – as James Lowther (MP for Penrith and the son of the Westmorland MP who had spoken against the 1878 bill at its Second Reading) said at the Third Reading of a Welsh private bill – &quot;the beauty of Thirlmere had been improved&quot; by the scheme.
Thirlmere water reached Manchester through a single 40-inch diameter cast iron pipe; due to leakage, only about 80% of the intended 10 million gallons a day supply reached Manchester. and, as early as May 1895 more than half the additional supply was accounted for by increased consumption. The Manchester Corporation Act 1891 (54 &amp; 55 Vict. c. ccvii) had allowed Manchester to specify water closets for all new buildings and modification of existing houses; Manchester now encouraged back-fitting of water closets and reduced the additional charge for baths.
The average daily consumption in 1899 was 32.5 million gallons a day, with 41 million gallons being consumed in a single day at the end of August In June 1900, Manchester Corporation accepted the recommendation of its Waterworks Committee that a second pipe be laid from Thirlmere; it insisted that despite any potential shortfall in water supply a &#x27;water-closet&#x27; policy should be continued. The first section of the second pipe was laid at Troutbeck in October 1900. Hill noted that it would take three or four years to complete the second pipe, at the current rate of increase of consumption as soon as the second pipe was completed it would be time to start on the third.

In April 1901, the Longdendale reservoirs were &#x27;practically full&#x27;; by mid-July they held only 49 days&#x27; supply, and it was thought prudent to cut off the water supply at night; by October stocks were down to 23 days&#x27;, even though water was running to waste at Thirlmere In 1902, the constant supply was maintained throughout the summer and the Longdendale stocks never dropped below 55 days&#x27; consumption, but 1904 again saw the suspension of supply at night, with stocks falling as low as 17 day&#x27;s supply at the start of November just before the second pipe came into use.

===Subsequent phases and consequent criticism===
The second pipe could deliver 12 million gallons a day, giving a total capacity of the aqueduct of twenty million gallons a day. The water level was raised to 35 ft above natural; the area of the lake now increasing to 690 acres. Seventy-nine acres of Shoulthwaite Moss (north of Thirlmere) were reclaimed as winter pasture to compensate for the loss of acreage around Thirlmere. A third pipe was authorised in 1906, construction began in October 1908, and was completed in 1915: this increased the potential supply from Thirlmere to thirty million gallons a day against an average daily demand which had now reached forty-five million gallons: in the summer of 1911 it had again been necessary to suspend the water supply at night. The lake was then raised to fifty feet above natural; a fourth and final pipeline was completed in 1927, its authorisation having been delayed by the First World War until 1921; as early as 1918 Manchester Corporation had identified the need for a further source of water, and identified Haweswater as that source.

At the committee stage of Manchester&#x27;s 1919 bill to tap Haweswater, the average daily demand on Manchester&#x27;s water supply in 1917 was said to have been 51.2 million gallons a day, with the reliable supply from Longdendale being no more than 20 million gallons a day and Thirlmere being able to supply 30 million gallons a day, which would rise to 40 million gallons a day when the fourth pipe was laid. The aqueduct capacity could be increased to fifty million gallons a day by laying a fifth pipe, but could not be increased beyond that whilst the aqueduct was still being used to deliver water to Manchester.

At the committee stage of the Haweswater bill, objectors made no mention of the aesthetic concerns raised against the Thirlmere bills: &quot;The world now knows that many of the fears then expressed were very foolish ones, and would never be realised under any circumstances, or at any place&quot; said the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; although Manchester countered the suggestion that it should not annex Haweswater, but instead further raise the level of Thirlmere because &quot;it would mean such injury to the Lake District that they would have the whole country up against them&quot;

When the Lords defeated Manchester&#x27;s Bill for abstraction of water from Ullswater in 1962, however, many speakers pointed to Manchester&#x27;s stewardship of Thirlmere to show why the bill should be defeated:
* To improve the retention of water in the catchment area, from 1907 onwards Manchester had planted extensive stands of conifers on both banks of the reservoir; as they grew, they had radically altered the appearance of the area, and (as James Lowther - now Lord Ullswater - complained) destroyed the views from the road on the west bank provided to give the public views of Helvellyn
* As Thirlmere water became more essential as a supply to Manchester, the draw-down of the reservoir in dry weather increased to double the 8–9 foot promised in the 1870s. 
* &quot;Large flooding of a valley bottom means an end to farming, and Thirlmere and Mardale are farmless and depopulated&quot; but this was not just because of the higher water level. There was no provision for water treatment downstream of Thirlmere (or Longdendale), and Manchester therefore relied on minimising pollution at source. To achieve this, it minimised human activity in the catchment area. Much of the settlement around Wythburn church (including the Nag&#x27;s Head, a coaching inn with Wordsworthian associations) remained above water level but it was suppressed, accommodation for necessary waterworks employees being provided at Fisher End and Stanah east of the northern end of the reservoir. Eventually Manchester Corporation closed Wythburn churchyard, St John&#x27;s in the Vale being now more convenient for its future customers.
* To protect the water from contamination by tourists and visitors, bathing boating and fishing were prohibited, and access to the lake effectively banned. This policy was supported by &quot;...barbed wire, wire netting, regimented rows of conifers and trespass warning notices, as common as &#x27;Verboten&#x27; notices in Nazi Germany…&quot; said the &quot;Yorkshire Post&quot; in 1946.

==Thirlmere after Manchester==
Under the Water Act 1973 (c. 37) ownership passed from Manchester to the North West Water Authority; this was privatised (as North West Water) in 1990 and a subsequent merger created United Utilities, a private water and wastewater company, which now owns and manages the reservoir and its catchment area. Keswick is now supplied with Thirlmere water (via a water treatment works at Bridge End to the north of the dam), and () it is intended to also supply West Cumbria from Thirlmere by 2022, thus allowing cessation of water abstraction from Ennerdale Water. The crenelated building housing the original &#x27;straining well&#x27; at the northern end of the tunnel under Dunmail Raise (made redundant by a water treatment plant at the southern exit of the tunnel under the Raise) which began operation in 1980) is now a Grade II listed building.

The new water treatment plant has permitted greater public access to the lake, and the views across the lake from the roads on either side have been restored by the selective felling of non-native trees between them and the lake shore. A permissive path allows access to the summit of Great How (), which lies between the northern end of the reservoir and the A591 road. The landscape remains heavily influenced by land management policies intended to protect water quality; in April–May 1999 there were 282 cases of cryptosporidiosis in Liverpool and Greater Manchester and the outbreak was thought to be due to the presence of the Cryptosporidium parasite in livestock grazing in the Thirlmere catchment area.

South of the lake, the only habitation is the occasional hill farm around Steel End. From the south end of the lake to the dam, the reservoir completely covers the floor of a narrow steep-sided valley whose sides have extensive and predominantly coniferous forestry plantations, without dwellings or settlements. During periods of dry weather, the water level drops revealing a wide band of bare exposed rock. According to the Lake District National Park Authority:
If the damming of the valley and the enlargement of two small lakes to form a large reservoir was landscape change on a large scale, so was the afforestation of nearly 800 hectares of land to prevent erosion, protect water quality and to profit from harvested timber. It is regarded by many as the greater crime. The large blocks of non-indigenous conifers and the scar left by draw-down of the reservoir in dry periods are undoubtedly elements which detract from Thirlmere’s natural beauty. However, the valley still has the drama of its soaring fellsides, a large body of water and north of the reservoir the rural charm of St John’s in the Vale. It is stunning scenery.

<text>The Basilica of Our Lady of Peace (, ) is a Catholic minor basilica dedicated to Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro, the administrative capital of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (Ivory Coast). Guinness World Records lists it as the largest church in the world, having surpassed the previous record holder, Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, upon completion. It has an area of and is tall. However, it also includes a rectory and a villa (counted in the overall area), which are not strictly part of the church. It can accommodate 18,000 worshippers, compared to 60,000 for St. Peter&#x27;s. Ordinary liturgies conducted at the basilica are usually attended by only a few hundred people. The basilica is administered by Polish Pallottines at a cost of US$1.5 million annually.

The basilica was constructed between 1985 and 1989 with different cost estimates given by various groups. Some stated that it cost US$175 million, US$300 million, or as high as US$600 million. The designs of the dome and encircled plaza are clearly inspired by the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City, although it is not an outright replica. The cornerstone was laid on 10 August 1985, and it was consecrated on 10 September 1990 by Pope John Paul II, who had just formally accepted the basilica as a gift from Félix Houphouët-Boigny on behalf of the Catholic Church.

The basilica is not to be confused with a cathedral. Our Lady of Peace is located in the Diocese of Yamoussoukro; the Cathedral of Saint Augustine—less than away—is smaller in size than the basilica but the principal place of worship and seat of the bishop of the diocese.

== Architecture ==

While designing it after the Vatican basilica, the Lebanese architect Pierre Fakhoury constructed the dome to be slightly lower than the Basilica of Saint Peter, but topped with a larger cross. The finished height is . The dome is more than twice the diameter of St. Peter&#x27;s in Rome, versus . The base of the dome is much lower than Saint Peter&#x27;s, so the overall height is slightly less. The basilica is constructed with marble imported from Italy and is furnished with of contemporary stained glass from France. France Vitrail International near Paris handmade the stained glass for the Basilica which was the largest such order ever placed and comprised of material assembled in 18,500 panels.

Columns are plentiful throughout the basilica but are not uniform in style; the smaller columns are structural, while the larger ones are decorative and contain elevators, rainwater conduits from the roof and other building mechanical devices. The nave contains enough space to seat 7,000 people, with standing room for an additional 11,000 people. Apart from the basilica are two identical villas. One of the villas accommodates the clergy who operate the basilica. A room in the other villa is reserved for papal visits, of which only one has occurred, when the basilica was consecrated.

The wood chosen for the pews in the Basilica was iroko wood.

== Construction ==
The basilica was built by the French company Dumez.

The cost of the basilica was met with some controversy globally when construction began, especially as the Côte d&#x27;Ivoire was going through an economic and fiscal crisis at the time. Pope John Paul II agreed to consecrate the basilica on the condition that a hospital also be built nearby. This hospital, whose construction was frozen during the First Ivorian Civil War, was finally completed in 2014 and opened in January 2015, at a cost of €21.3 million.

== Memorial ==

Côte d&#x27;Ivoire President Houphouët-Boigny chose his birthplace of Yamoussoukro to be the site of the new capital city of his country in 1983. As part of the plan of the city, the president wanted to memorialize himself with the construction of the basilica. Houphouët-Boigny is even pictured kneeling beside Jesus at his triumphal entry into Jerusalem in one stained glass panel. Due to the location of the Basilica, it was dubbed by the media as &quot;basilica in the bush&quot;. Houphouët-Boigny believed it would become a pilgrimage site for African Catholics.

<text>Robert Burnham Jr. (June 16, 1931 – March 20, 1993) was an American astronomer, best known for writing the classic three-volume &quot;Burnham&#x27;s Celestial Handbook&quot;. He discovered numerous asteroids, including the Mars crossing asteroid 3397 Leyla, and six comets.

Burnham&#x27;s late years were tragic; he died destitute and alone. However, he is remembered by a generation of deep sky observers for his unique contribution to astronomy, the &quot;Celestial Handbook.&quot; The main-belt asteroid 3467 Bernheim was named in his honor.
 

==Early life and career==
Burnham was born in Chicago, Illinois, in 1931, the son of Robert Sr. and Lydia. His family moved to Prescott, Arizona, in 1940, and he graduated from high school there in 1949. That was the culmination of his formal education. Always a shy person, he had few friends, never married, and spent most of his time observing with his home-built telescope.

In the fall of 1957 he received considerable local publicity when he discovered his first comet. This led to his being hired by Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1958 to work on a survey of stellar proper motion using a blink comparator. While Burnham was working at Lowell, he and his co-worker, Norman G. Thomas, discovered five more comets (including 56P/Slaughter-Burnham), and in excess of 1500 asteroids.

==&quot;Burnham&#x27;s Celestial Handbook&quot;==

In addition to his regular duties at the observatory, Burnham spent almost all of his free time working on the &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot;. His writing and his book were never officially supported by Lowell Observatory.

Subtitled &quot;An Observer&#x27;s Guide to the Universe Beyond the Solar System,&quot; the &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; combines a lengthy introduction to astronomy with catalog information for every constellation in the sky. Thousands of stars and deep sky objects visible in small telescopes are covered in meticulous detail.

Originally self-published in a loose-leaf serial format beginning in 1966, and with a revised edition by Dover Publications in 1978, the &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; was well reviewed in amateur astronomy magazines and became a best seller in this specialized field. It is still in-print and is considered to be a classic in the literature of amateur astronomy.

Due to the popularity of &quot;Celestial Handbook,&quot; Tony Ortega writing in the Phoenix New Times in 1997 described Burnham as an author &quot;whose name has become so familiar to some readers it has become a sort of shorthand, like Audubon to birders, Hoyle to card players, Webster to poor spellers, Robert to parliamentarians.&quot; Ortega then described the book series as:

Burnham and spectra of planetary nebulae:
:For the modern observer, a considerable number of interesting planetary nebulae are within range of a good amateur instrument, ranging from tiny stellar-appearing objects up to great phantom rings such as NGC 7293 in Aquarius. To identify the more stellar planetaries, the interested observer may experiment with a simple technique that impressively demonstrates their peculiar radiation: merely obtain a small piece of replica diffraction grating and place this between the eyepiece and the observer&#x27;s eye. Seen in this way, all the images of stars will be drawn out into narrow colored streaks, but a planetary nebula will appear as a series of discrete individual images, each one indicating a definite wavelength in which the object is radiating. The observer should try this unusual technique on some of the smaller and brighter planetaries, such as NGC 6572 in Ophiuchus or NGC 6210 in Hercules, before attempting to identify more distant nearly stellar examples.

The color contrast of Albireo (β Cygni):
:Albireo is one of the most beautiful double stars in the sky, considered by many observers to be the finest in the heavens for the small telescope. The brighter star is a golden yellow or &quot;topaz&quot;, magnitude 3.09, spectrum K3; the &quot;sapphire&quot; companion is magnitude 5.11, spectrum B8 V. The separation is 34.3&quot;, an easy object for the low power telescope. Even a pair of good binoculars, if steadily held will split the pair. Albireo is noted for its superb color contrast, best seen with the eyepiece slightly displaced from the sharpest focus. Miss Agnes Clerke (1905) called the tints &quot;golden and azure&quot;, giving perhaps &quot;the most lovely effect of color in the heavens&quot;. For the average amateur telescope there is probably no pair so attractive, though the color effect seems to diminish in either very small or very large telescopes, or with too high a magnification. No more than 30X is required on a good 6-inch to show this superb pair as two contrasting jewels suspended against a background of glittering star-dust. The surrounding region is wonderfully rich, and for wide-angle telescopes the star clouds to the northeast are probably unequalled in splendor in the entire heavens.

Messier 22:
:Messier 22 is one of the closest globulars to the galactic plane. It also lies less than a degree from the ecliptic, so astrophotographers will occasionally have an opportunity to record a bright planet in the field with the cluster; the planet Mercury, for example, passed through the field on december 12, 1977; Venus was in nearly the same position in early january, 1978. Such events are not always mentioned in astronomical publications, so the observer must make his own predictions by periodically checking planetary positions in the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot;.

Burnham and &quot;sabi&quot;:
:The indefinable mood which the Japanese call &quot;sabi&quot;, for which there is no exact English equivalent, but which might be roughly defined as that direct inward perception by which we find deep significance or great artistic quality in some outwardly simple and unpretentious object. A diamond bracelet from Tiffany&#x27;s for example, might contain no &quot;sabi&quot;, while a woodcarving by a simple uneducated fisherman might be packed to the (ahem) gills with it.

Burnham, the Pleiades, and Devil&#x27;s Tower:
:In American Indian legend the Pleiades are connected with the &quot;Mateo Tepe&quot; or Devil&#x27;s Tower, that curious and wonderfully impressive rock formation which rises like a colossal petrified tree-stump to a height of 1300 feet above the plains of northeastern Wyoming. According to the lore of the Kiowa, the Tower was raised up by the Great Spirit to protect seven Indian maidens who were pursued by giant bears; the maidens were afterwards placed in the sky as the Pleiades cluster, and the marks of the bears&#x27; claws may be seen in the vertical striations on the sides of the Tower unto this day. The Cheyenne had a similar legend.

==Life after Lowell==

In April 1979, the year after &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; was published by Dover, Burnham received notice that the proper motion survey would soon be completed and that the observatory could not afford to keep him on in the position he had long held. Despite months of warning, he failed to make other arrangements and, after twenty-one years at Lowell, his job ended in December of that year. Unwilling to take the only position that was offered to him, that of janitor at the observatory, he left.

Burnham was never able to recover personally, professionally, or financially after he lost the job at Lowell. Over the next few years, while sales of the &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; were rapidly growing, Burnham&#x27;s personal circumstances were steadily worsening. His shyness increased and he shunned all publicity, becoming even more reclusive. He bickered often with Dover about royalties and about the creation of possible new editions or translations of his book. He also worked sporadically on a fantasy novel – which he never completed.

Writing for the &quot;Frosty Drew Observatory&quot; in 2000, Doug Stewart said:

As his situation worsened, Burnham, who was never married, became bitter and depressed, and isolated himself from his few friends and family. He had lived for a time in Phoenix, Arizona, but in May 1986 he left Phoenix and dropped out of sight completely, informing no one but his publisher of his whereabouts. Despite being the author of a successful book, Burnham spent the last years of his life in poverty and obscurity in San Diego, California, selling his paintings of cats at Balboa Park. The fans of &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot; were likely unaware of his personal circumstances; possibly assuming that a different and unrelated Robert Burnham, an editor at &quot;Astronomy&quot; magazine, was the author.

==Naming of 3467 Bernheim==
Norm Thomas, Burnham&#x27;s former co-worker at Lowell Observatory, had told Burnham that he planned to name an asteroid after him. On September 26, 1981, Thomas discovered a main belt asteroid, but since asteroid 834 Burnhamia, named after the unrelated 19th century astronomer Sherburne Wesley Burnham, already carried the name, a different spelling was needed. Thomas chose the spelling &quot;Bernheim&quot;, for the Burnham family&#x27;s ancestral Bohemian surname. Thus the asteroid named to honor Robert Burnham Jr. was named 3467 Bernheim.

==Death and posthumous &quot;interview&quot;==

Burnham died destitute and alone at the age of sixty-one in 1993. His family did not learn about his death (apparently by his choice) until two years later, and didn&#x27;t report it to the press even then because they were unaware of his stature in the amateur astronomy community.

After his death, it was realized that he had often attended programs presented by the San Diego Astronomy Association (at the Ruben H. Fleet Space Theater in Balboa Park) without anyone recognizing him. In spite of the tragedy of his later years, Burnham continues to be remembered by a generation of deep sky observers for his unique &quot;Celestial Handbook&quot;. His cremated remains are interred at the Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California.

In 2009 a memorial consisting of a small bronze plaque resembling a page in &quot;Burnham&#x27;s Celestial Handbook&quot; was installed on the Pluto Walk at Lowell Observatory.

Burnham rarely gave interviews, but at the height of the popularity of &quot;Handbook&quot; in 1982, he wrote a piece where he playfully interviewed himself for the magazine &quot;Astronomy&quot;. A much longer version of this essay, &quot;An Interview with the author of The Celestial Handbook,&quot; dated April 1983, was discovered among Burnham&#x27;s papers and it was first published in its entirety by The Village Voice in June 2011, 18 years after his death. It was introduced as follows:
==Bibliography==
&quot;Burnham&#x27;s Celestial Handbook&quot; was originally self-published in a loose-leaf serial format beginning in 1966; it was issued in hardcover and later as a paperback in a three-volume, revised and enlarged edition by Dover Publications beginning in 1978.

<text>Pontefract (or Pomfret) Castle is a castle ruin in the town of Pontefract, in West Yorkshire, England. King Richard II is thought to have died there. It was the site of a series of famous sieges during the 17th-century English Civil War.

==History==

The castle, on a rock to the east of the town above All Saints&#x27; Church, was constructed in approximately 1070 by Ilbert de Lacy on land which had been granted to him by William the Conqueror as a reward for his support during the Norman Conquest. There is, however, evidence of earlier occupation of the site. Initially the castle was a wooden structure which was replaced with stone over time. The Domesday Survey of 1086 recorded &quot;Ilbert&#x27;s Castle&quot; which probably referred to Pontefract Castle.

Robert de Lacy failed to support King Henry I during his power struggle with his brother, and the King confiscated the castle from the family during the 12th century. Roger de Lacy paid King Richard I 3,000 marks for the Honour of Pontefract, but the King retained possession of the castle. His successor King John gave de Lacy the castle in 1199, the year John ascended the throne. Roger died in 1213 and was succeeded by his eldest son, John. However, the King took possession of Castle Donington and Pontefract Castle. The de Lacys lived in the castle until the early 14th century. It was under the tenure of the de Lacys that the magnificent multilobate donjon was built.

In 1311 the castle passed by marriage to the estates of the House of Lancaster. Thomas, Earl of Lancaster (circa 1278–1322) was beheaded outside the castle walls six days after his defeat at the Battle of Boroughbridge, a sentence placed on him by King Edward II himself in the great hall. This resulted in the earl becoming a martyr with his tomb at Pontefract Priory becoming a shrine. It next went to Henry, Duke of Lancaster and subsequently to John of Gaunt, third son of King Edward III. He made the castle his personal residence, spending vast amounts of money improving it.

===Richard II===

In the closing years of the 14th century, Richard II banished John of Gaunt&#x27;s son Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Hereford, from England. Following the death of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, in 1399, Richard II seized much of the property due to Bolingbroke. Richard then shared some of the seized property around among his favourites. The castle at Pontefract was among such properties which was under threat. These events aroused Bolingbroke to return to England to claim his rights to the Duchy of Lancaster and the properties of his father. Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard II&quot; (Act 2, scene 1, 277) relates Bolingbroke&#x27;s homecoming in the words of Northumberland in the speech of the eight tall ships:-


When Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur on the Humber, he made straight way for his castle at Pontefract. King Richard II, being in Ireland at the time, was in no position to oppose Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke soon deposed Richard and took the crown for himself as Henry IV.
Richard II was captured by Henry Bolingbroke&#x27;s supporters in August 1399 and was initially imprisoned in the Tower of London. Sometime before Christmas that year he was moved to Pontefract Castle (via Knaresborough) where he remained under guard until his death, perhaps on 14 February 1400. William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard III&quot; mentions this incident:

Various chroniclers suggest that Richard was starved to death by his captors, and others suggest he starved himself. A contemporary French chronicler suggested that Richard II had been hacked to death, but this is, according to the ODNB, &quot;almost certainly fictitious&quot;.

===Richard III===
Richard III had two relatives of Elizabeth Woodville beheaded at Pontefract Castle on 25 June 1483 – her son, Sir Richard Grey, and her brother, Anthony Woodville, 2nd Earl Rivers.

===Tudor Era===

In 1536, the castle&#x27;s guardian, Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy handed over the castle to the leaders of the Pilgrimage of Grace, a Catholic rebellion from northern England against the rule of King Henry VIII. Lord Darcy was executed for this alleged &quot;surrender&quot;, which the king viewed as an act of treason.

King Henry VIII of England stayed at the castle arriving on 23 August 1541 during his summer royal progress of the North. It was alleged during his visit that Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth wife, Catherine Howard, committed her first act of adultery with Sir Thomas Culpeper at Pontefract Castle, for which she was later apprehended and beheaded at the Tower of London without trial. Mary, Queen of Scots was lodged at the castle on 28 January 1569, travelling between Wetherby and Rotherham.

===Royalist stronghold===

On his way south to London, King James rode from Grimston Park to view Pontefract Castle on 19 April 1603 and stayed the night at the Bear Inn at Doncaster. The castle was included in English jointure property of his wife, Anne of Denmark.

Royalists controlled Pontefract Castle at the start of the English Civil War. The first of three sieges began in December 1644 and continued until the following March when Marmaduke Langdale, 1st Baron Langdale of Holme arrived with Royalist reinforcements and the Parliamentarian army retreated. During the siege, mining and artillery caused damage and the Piper Tower collapsed as a result. The second siege began on 21 March 1645, shortly after the end of the first siege, and the garrison surrendered in July after hearing the news of Charles I&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Naseby. Parliament garrisoned the castle until June 1648 when Royalists sneaked into the castle and took control. Pontefract Castle was an important base for the Royalists, and raiding parties harried Parliamentarians in the area.

Oliver Cromwell led the final siege of Pontefract Castle in November 1648. Charles I was executed in January, and Pontefract&#x27;s garrison came to an agreement and Colonel Morrice handed over the castle to Major General John Lambert on 24 March 1649. Following requests from the townspeople, the grand jury at York, and Major General Lambert, on 27 March Parliament gave orders that Pontefract Castle should be &quot;totally demolished &amp; levelled to the ground&quot; and materials from the castle would be sold off. Piecemeal dismantling after the main organised activity of slighting may have further contributed to the castle&#x27;s ruined state.

It is still possible to visit the castle&#x27;s 11th-century cellars, which were used to store military equipment during the civil war.

==Preservation==

Little survives of what &quot;must have been one of the most impressive castles in Yorkshire&quot; other than parts of the curtain wall and excavated and tidied inner walls. It had inner and outer baileys. Parts of a 12th-century wall and the Piper Tower&#x27;s postern gate and the foundations of a chapel are the oldest remains. The ruins of the Round Tower or keep are on the 11th-century mound. The Great Gate flanked by 14th-century semi-circular towers had inner and outer barbicans. Chambers excavated into the rock in the inner bailey possibly indicate the site of the old hall and the North Bailey gate is marked by the remains of a rectangular tower.

The castle has several unusual features. The donjon has a rare Quatrefoil design. Other examples of this type of Keep are Clifford&#x27;s Tower, York and at the Château d&#x27;Étampes in France.
Pontefract also has an &quot;torre albarrana&quot;, a fortification almost unknown outside the Iberian Peninsula. Known as the Swillington Tower, the detached tower was attached to the north wall by a bridge. Its purpose was to increase the defender&#x27;s range of flanking fire.

Wakefield Council, who manage the site, commissioned William Anelay Ltd to begin repairs on the castle in September 2015, but work stopped in November 2016 when Anelay went into administration. The Council then engaged Heritage Building &amp; Conservation (North) Ltd, who began work on the site in March 2017. A new visitor centre and cafe were opened in July 2017; but in April 2018 the council announced that they had terminated the contract with HB&amp;C (North) Ltd, as no work had been done since mid-March, and they had not had any reassurances that the work would restart. On Yorkshire Day 2019, the restoration was completed, and the castle was removed from Historic England&#x27;s &quot;Heritage At Risk&quot; list.

Excavations led by DigVentures in 2019–20 in the castle&#x27;s drawbridge pit uncovered numerous mason&#x27;s marks on the structure, as well as lead shot dating to the Civil War.

<doc id="624762" wikidata="Q2739613" url="?curid=624762" title="Colin Gubbins">
<text>Major-General Sir Colin McVean Gubbins, (2 July 1896 – 11 February 1976) was the prime mover of the Special Operations Executive (SOE) in the Second World War.

Gubbins was also responsible for setting up the secret Auxiliary Units, a commando force based around the Home Guard, to operate on the flanks and to the rear of German lines if the United Kingdom were invaded during Operation Sea Lion, Germany&#x27;s planned invasion.

==Early life==
Gubbins was born in Japan on 2 July 1896, the younger son and third child of John Harington Gubbins (1852–1929), Oriental Secretary at the British Legation. In the 1901 census he is shown living with his grandparents, Colin Alexander McVean and four siblings at Killiemore House on the Isle of Mull. He was educated at Cheltenham College and at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich where he graduated 56th out of 70 cadets.

==Military career==
===First World War===
Gubbins was commissioned into the Royal Field Artillery in 1914. On the outbreak of war he was visiting the German city of Heidelberg in order to improve his German language skills and had to make a perilous journey back to Britain via Belgium, arriving in Dover the day before Britain entered the conflict. Gubbins served as a battery officer on the Western Front – initially with the 126th Battery as part of the British Army&#x27;s 3rd Corps. He first saw action on 22 May 1915 in the Second Battle of Ypres and on 9 June was promoted to lieutenant.

In July 1916 he participated in the Battle of the Somme and received the Military Cross, the citation for which, appearing in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; in September 1916, reads as follows:

On 7 October he was wounded in the neck by a gunshot but recovered fully. In the spring of 1917 Gubbins participated in the Battle of Arras and in the winter suffered the effects of mustard gas. In early 1918 Gubbins was promoted to captain and took part in the Battle of St Quentin. Shortly afterwards he was evacuated from the front with a case of trench fever (17 April 1918).

===Interwar period===
In 1919 he joined the staff of General Sir Edmund Ironside in the North Russia Campaign serving as his ADC in Murmansk from 13 April to 27 September 1919. His service in the Russian Civil War left Gubbins with a life-long hatred of Communism.

On 2 December 1919 Gubbins was posted to the 47th Battery of the 5th Division in Kildare during the Irish War of Independence. He served as a military intelligence officer and in 1920 attended a three-day course in guerrilla warfare organized by the HQ 5th Division. Gubbins characterised his service in the conflict as &quot;being shot at from behind hedges by men in trilbys and mackintoshes and not allowed to shoot back&quot;. 

Promoted to Brigade Major, after the war was ended by the Anglo-Irish Treaty, Gubbins provided 18-pounder artillery pieces to the Provisional Government of Ireland. The Irish Army used the artillery pieces in their attack against the Anti-Treaty IRA-held Four Courts, which began both the Battle of Dublin and the Irish Civil War. In August 1922, Gubbins reluctantly provided a gun carriage and six black horses for the military funeral of his former enemy: ex-IRA Director of Intelligence and Irish Army commander-in-chief Michael Collins, who had been ambushed and shot in the head by the anti-Treaty IRA. According to Stephen Dorril, however, Gubbins often expressed admiration in his later years for Michael Collins, whom he regarded as, &quot;the guerrilla soldier &quot;par excellence&quot;. Eventually he was posted back to England, that October.

His experiences in the Russian Civil War and the Irish War of Independence stimulated his lifelong interest in irregular warfare. One of the lessons drawn from the latter war was the importance of captured enemy documents which had provided the security forces with a wealth of invaluable intelligence on the IRA. Upon later establishing SOE, one of the key security features introduced was &quot;Commit as little as possible to writing. Memorise if you can. If you must carry documents, select what you must carry. Burn all secret waste and carbons&quot;.

After a period with signals intelligence at GHQ India, Gubbins graduated from the Staff College at Quetta in 1928, and in 1931 was appointed GSO3 in the Russian section of the War Office. Having been promoted to brevet major, in 1935 he joined MT1, the policy-making branch of the Military Training Directorate.

In October 1938, in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement, he was sent to the Sudetenland as a military member of the International Commission. Promoted to brevet lieutenant-colonel, he joined GS(R) — later to become MI(R) — in April 1939 he co-wrote training manuals on irregular warfare tactics for resistance movements, later translated and dropped into occupied Europe. He also made a visit to Warsaw to discuss sabotage and subversion with the Polish General Staff.

===Second World War===
When British forces were mobilized in August 1939, Gubbins was appointed Chief of Staff to the military mission to Poland led by Adrian Carton de Wiart. Gubbins and some of a contingent from MI(R) arrived in Warsaw on 3 September, within hours of the British declaration of war, but after only a few days the mission was forced by the rapidly deteriorating situation to abandon Warsaw. They finally crossed into Roumania in late September. Gubbins and Carton de Wiart were among the first people to report on the effectiveness of the German Panzer tactics.

In October 1939, following his return to Britain, Gubbins was sent to Paris as the head of a military mission to the Czech and Polish forces under French command. He was summoned from France in March 1940 to raise the Independent Companies, forerunners of the British Commandos, which he later commanded in several actions in Nordland during the Norwegian campaign (9 April – 10 June 1940). Although he was criticized in some quarters for having asked too much of untried troops, he proved to be a bold and resourceful commander. During the operations around Bodø, he assumed command of 24th (Guards) Brigade, and was ruthless in dismissing a Guards battalion commander whose nerve had apparently failed. Gubbins was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his service in the campaign.

Although he was recommended for command of a division by Lieutenant General Claude Auchinleck, the commander of all troops in the Norwegian campaign, on his return to Britain he nevertheless rejoined MI(R) and was directed by General Headquarters Home Forces to form the secret Auxiliary Units, a commando force based around the Home Guard together with regular army sabotage teams, to operate on the flanks and to the rear of German lines if Britain were ever invaded.

In November 1940 Gubbins became acting Brigadier and, at the request of Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, was seconded to the Special Operations Executive (SOE), which had recently been established to &quot;coordinate all action by way of sabotage and subversion against the enemy overseas&quot;. Besides maintaining his existing connections with the Poles and Czechs, Gubbins was given three tasks: to set up training facilities; to devise operating procedures acceptable to the Admiralty and Air Ministry; and to establish close working relations with the Joint Planning Staff.

Despite many frustrations and disappointments, mainly due to shortage of aircraft, he persevered with training organizers and dispatching them into the field. The first liaison flight to Poland took place in February 1941, and during 1942 and 1943 European resistance movements aided by SOE scored notable successes, including a raid on a heavy water production plant in Norway. Gubbins was also responsible for establishing the so-called Shetland Bus, a regular link between the Shetland Islands and Norway, which, by the spring of 1942, had infiltrated almost 100 saboteurs and 150 tons of explosive into the country.
In September 1943 GHQ Middle East, the Foreign Office, and the Joint Intelligence Committee sought to remove SOE&#x27;s autonomy. Despite having the firm support of Dalton&#x27;s successor, Lord Selborne, the resulting modus vivendi placed SOE&#x27;s field operations under the direction of theatre commanders. Sir Charles Hambro, the executive head of SOE, resigned in protest. Gubbins was appointed as his replacement. SOE&#x27;s position nevertheless remained precarious, and in January 1944 there was a further attempt to dismantle SOE, following the revelation that SOE&#x27;s operations in the Netherlands had been penetrated by Nazi intelligence.

As head of SOE, Gubbins co-ordinated the activities of resistance movements worldwide. Gubbins&#x27; role involved consultation at the highest level with the Foreign Office, the Chiefs of Staff, representatives of the resistance organizations, governments-in-exile, and other Allied agencies including particularly the US Office of Strategic Services (OSS). It turned out that the organized resistance was more effective than Whitehall had expected; in northwest Europe, where SOE&#x27;s activities were under Gubbins&#x27;s personal control, General Dwight D. Eisenhower later estimated that the contribution of the French Resistance alone had been worth six divisions.

==Later life==
When SOE was shut down in 1946 the War Office could offer Gubbins no suitable position, and when he retired from the army he became the managing director of a carpet and textile manufacturer. He remained in touch with people in many of the countries he had helped to liberate, and was invited by Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands to join the Bilderberg group. He was also a supporter of the Special Forces Club, which he had co-founded.

==Personal life==
Gubbins&#x27;s first marriage was to Norah Creina (b. 1894) on 22 October 1919. The couple had two sons, the elder, Michael, served in the SOE and was killed at Anzio in 1944. The couple were divorced in 1944 and on 25 September 1950 he married the Norwegian-born Anna Elise Tradin, née Jensen (b. 1914, d. 2007). His niece was the journalist and writer Una-Mary Parker.

==Death==
A shooter and fisherman, Gubbins spent his last years at his home in the Hebrides, on the Isle of Harris. He was appointed Deputy Lieutenant of the islands area of the Western Isles in 1976. Gubbins died at Stornoway in the Hebrides on 11 February 1976.

==Testimonials==
His star cryptographer at SOE was Leo Marks, whose book &quot;Between Silk and Cyanide&quot; (1998) contains a detailed portrait of Gubbins and his work as Marks knew it. At one point (p. 222), Marks describes Gubbins:

In the book &quot;Virtual History&quot; (1997), Andrew Roberts and Niall Ferguson call Gubbins &quot;one of the war&#x27;s unsung heroes&quot;.

There is a very detailed account of Gubbins&#x27; wartime career in Churchill&#x27;s Ministry Of Ungentlemanly Warfare, by Giles Milton (John Murray, 2016)

<doc id="624764" wikidata="Q157137" url="?curid=624764" title="Kryvyi Rih">
<text>Kryvyi Rih (; , ), also known as Krivoy Rog ( ), is a city in central Ukraine. It hosts the administration of Kryvyi Rih Raion and its subordinate Kryvyi Rih urban hromada in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The city is part of the Kryvyi Rih Metropolitan Region. Its population is estimated at making it the seventh-most populous city in Ukraine and the second largest by area. Kryvyi Rih is claimed to be the longest city in Europe.

Located at the confluence of the Saksahan and Inhulets rivers, Kryvyi Rih was founded as a military staging post in 1775. Urban-industrial growth followed Belgian, French and British investment in the exploitation of the area&#x27;s rich iron-ore deposits, generally called Kryvbas, in the 1880s. Kryvyi Rih gained city status after the October Revolution in 1919.

Stalin-era industrialisation built Kryvorizhstal in 1934, the largest integrated metallurgical works in the Soviet Union. After a brutal German occupation in World War II, Kryvyi Rih experienced renewed growth through to the 1970s. The economic dislocation associated with the break-up of the Soviet Union contributed to high unemployment and a large-scale exodus from the city in the 1990s. The privatization of Kryvorizhstal in 2005 was followed by increased foreign and private investment which helped finance urban regeneration. Beginning in 2017, there were major labour protests and strikes.

Since the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Kryvyi Rih has been the target of frequent Russian missile strikes. It was a focus of the southern Ukraine campaign, but the closest ground advance by Russia stalled some to the south of the city before it was turned back in March 2022.

==Etymology==
Kryvyi Rih, which in Ukrainian literally means &#x27;crooked horn&#x27; or &#x27;curved cape&#x27;, was the name originally given in the 18th century to the general area of the present city by Zaporozhian Cossacks. According to local legend, the first village in the area was founded by a &quot;crooked&quot; (Ukrainian slang for &#x27;one-eyed&#x27;) Cossack named &quot;Rih&quot; (literally, &#x27;horn&#x27;). The name likely derives from the shape of the landmass formed by the confluence of the river Saksahan with the Inhulets.

==History==
===Early history===

In 1734 the Cossack Zaporizhian Sich (or Host) incorporated the area within the Inhul Palanka division of their &quot;de-facto&quot; republic. A list of villages and winter camps (zymivnyki) from that time mentions Kryvyi Rih. In 1770, Kryvyi Rih was again recorded as the camp of the Zaporizhian Sich.

In May 1775, after the end of the Russian-Turkish War, Russian authorities established Kryvyi Rih as a staging post, in the tradition of the Mongol yam, on the roads to the Russian garrisons of Kremenchuk, Kinburn foreland and Ochakov. In August 1775, on the direct order of Catherine the Great, the Sich was forcibly dissolved. The cossack lands were annexed to the Russian province of Novorossiya and distributed among the Russian and Ukrainian gentry.

The early 19th century saw the construction of the first stone houses (1828), and three water mills. In 1860, the village was designated a township.

===Industrial growth===
Alexander Pol discovered and initiated iron ore investigation and production in this area. He is credited with discovering the Kryvbas. This stimulated the formation of a mining district. In 1884, Alexander III started the Catherine Railway, first to Dnipro and then 505 km to the coal-mining region of Donbas.

In 1880, with 5 million francs of capital, Pol founded the &quot;French Society of Kryvyi Rih Ores&quot;. In 1882 16.4 thousand tons of ore were extracted from surface mines on the outskirts of town by 150 workers. The first underground mine of the basin began operations in 1886. In 1892, the &quot;Hdantsivka&quot; ironworks was started. Ore began to be processed locally, spawning new metallurgical enterprises spurred by substantial western, and in particular Belgian, investment. At the same time Kryvyi Rih ore began to feed the German metallurgical industry in Silesia. In 1902, the Catherine Railroad linked Kryvyi Rih to the coal mines of the Donbas.

At the end of the 19th century the tallest building was the Central Synagogue, built by a thriving Jewish community of artisans, merchants and traders. In 1905, the community was subject to pogroms, in which the authorities were complicit. Many Jewish people left the area, emigrating to Germany, Austria-Hungary and the United States.

The surrounding mines attracted prospectors looking to turn a quick profit. The supply of mined ore soon exceeded demand. Many mines had to cut employment or temporarily suspend operations. Workers, many drawn from the Russian-speaking north (from Great Russia), laboured in harsh conditions with no security. Work in the mines induced lung cancer, tuberculosis and asthma. In protest, workers began to develop ideas about socialism and democracy. Labour unrest resulted in several terrorist attacks and in widespread strikes.

The First World War interrupted access to the export markets, and many workers were drafted into the military. A council of &quot;soviet&quot; of Soldiers and Worker&#x27;s Deputies was formed in 1917. January 1918 saw the first attempt by the Bolsheviks to establish the authority in the town of the new Soviet government in Moscow.

=== Russian Civil War ===
In the civil war that followed the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, Kryvyi Rih changed hands several times. In February 1918, the Bolsheviks proclaimed the Donetsk-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic, but then in March conceded the territory under the terms of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk to the German-controlled Ukrainian State. After the Germans and their Austro-Hungarian allies withdrew in November 1918, the town was successively occupied by the nationalists of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the counter-revolutionary Volunteer Army of General Denikin (the &quot;Whites&quot;), the anarchist Revolutionary Insurgent Army of Ukraine (the &quot;Makhnovshchina)&quot; and, from 17 January 1920, by the Bolshevik Red Army. In 1922 the region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR, a constituent republic of the Soviet Union.

The town, with a population of 22,571, was now designated a city. Mine operations were revived, and in 1924 a 55.3 km (34.4 mi) water-supply system was laid underground. In the summer of 1927, 10,000 people began to work on the Dnieprostroi, a huge dam on the Dnieper River in Zaporizhzhia, whose hydro-electric power drove Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s industrialisation. The first Mining Institute opened in 1929. The Medical and Pedagogical Institutes were founded.

In line with Stalin&#x27;s plans for break-neck industrialisation, in 1931 the foundation of the Kryvyi Rih Metallurgical Plant, the future Kryvorizhstal, was laid. The first blast furnace of the metallurgical works produced steel three years later. The city grew rapidly. In the surrounding countryside, industrialisation was accompanied by the collectivisation of agriculture. The dispossession of the peasants and the confiscation of their harvests induced the &quot;Holodomor&quot; or Great Famine of 1932–33.

By 1941, at over 200,000, the population of the industrial city had increased almost tenfold.

====Nazi occupation====
During World War II, Kryvyi Rih was occupied by the German Army from 15 August 1941 to 22 February 1944. It was administered for most of that period as part of the Reichskommissariat Ukraine. In advance of the Germans, industrial plant and machine operators were evacuated to Nizhny Tagil in the Urals. An initial toleration of Ukrainian cultural activity and propaganda by the pro-German Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in the town ended in January and February 1942 with the arrest and execution of the leading Ukrainian activists.

In 1939, 12,745 Jews had lived in Krivoy Rog, comprising about 6% of the total population. Those who did not leave the city during the organized evacuation were systematically concentrated and murdered by the Nazi occupiers during the Holocaust. The first mass killing of two to three hundred by an Einsatzkommando occurred at the end of August 1941 at a brick works. On 14–15 October a combination of SS, German police and Ukrainian auxiliaries murdered 7,000 more at an iron ore mine. Children were thrown into the pits alive.

Hitler had repeatedly stressed the crucial importance of this area: &quot;The Nikopol manganese is of such importance, it cannot be expressed in words. Loss of Nikopol (on the Dnieper River, today&#x27;s southwest of Zaporizhzhia) would mean the end of war.&quot; The German bridgehead on the left bank of the Dnieper gave the German command a base in order to restore the land connection with their forces locked in the Crimea. During the first half of January 1944, Soviet troops made repeated attempts to eliminate the Nikopol-Krivoy Rog enemy group. The Nikopol–Krivoy Rog Offensive did not succeed in breaking into the city until the end of February. Although the greater part of city was destroyed, a special 37th Red Army detachment prevented the German demolition of the power stations in the city and the Saksahan dams.
==== Post-war ====
After the war, people lived among the ruins while rebuilding the housing stock. The housing shortage was met by innovative technological solutions, and temporary barracks and houses were quickly built.

In the late 1940s, re-construction was accompanied by Stakhanovite propaganda: Pre-war iron ore production was restored by 1950. In 1961 this was supplemented by new mines and by the Central and, Northern Iron Ore Enrichment Works. By the end of the Soviet era, Kryvbas was producing 42% of the USSR&#x27;s and 80% of Ukrainian ore.

At the beginning of the 1960s, the city received a signature 185m-tall, guyed tubular steel TV mast. Housing stock was replaced and expanded with several large Khrushchyovkas apartment complexes. Urban planning incorporated broad tree-lined avenues with trams lines running down their center.

On June 16–18, 1963, increased food prices triggered protests in the city, estimated to involve between 1,000 and 6,000 people. After an ex-serviceman who had interacted with the police was severely beaten, there was rioting. Moscow sent in troops. While the authorities admitted to 4 dead and 15 wounded, witnesses report that soldiers killed at least 7, and that over 200 people were hospitalised with injuries. Fifteen hundred people received prison sentences.

In 1975, the city&#x27;s two-hundredth anniversary was marked by the development of the Jubilee mine and adjacent residential area, and by the construction of a new city administration building and park. In September 1976, the Krivorozh wool spinning factory was commissioned.

In last years of the Soviet Union, and following a sharp reduction in spending on cultural, sports and youth service, the city witnessed neighbourhood-based gang violence—the so-called &quot;war of Runners&quot;. The era of &quot;Perestrioka&quot; was also marked by the emergence of independent trade unions, and of new civic and political organisations.

The former Krivoi Rog Air Base is located nearby.

=== In independent Ukraine ===

==== Redevelopment and politics ====
In a national referendum on 1 December 1991, Ukrainian independence was approved by 90% of the votes cast in Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. The first 25 years of independence was a period of economic dislocation and adjustment. The population of the city decreased by almost 100,000, from a peak of 780,000 in the late 1980s.

Assisted by Metinvest, investment followed the 2005 privatization of Kryvorizhstal. There was extensive redevelopment including new shopping and entertainment centers. In July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, Kryvyi Rih Municipality and the Kryvyi Rih Raion came under a common city authority. The city remains the second most important in the Dnipropetrovsk region after Dnipro. Krivyi Rih has two independent universities, and several institutes and technical schools.

Until the events of Euromaidan in 2014 and their aftermath, in local and national elections Kryvyi Rih favored Russian-friendly candidates belonging first, in the 1990s, to the Communist Party of Ukraine and then, in the new century, the Party of Regions. In 2010 the city elected Party of Regions Yuriy Vilkul mayor, and helped Viktor Yanukovych to victory in the presidential election. After the Euromaidan events, which were accompanied by demonstrations and clashes in the city centre, support began to ebb from the Party of Regions. Petro Poroshenko, who insisted that Russian separatists in the Donbas &quot;don&#x27;t represent anybody&quot;, was supported in the presidential election of 2014. Vilkul was re-elected mayor in 2015, but amidst large-scale protests alleging electoral fraud.

In the 2019 Ukrainian presidential election the city supported its native son Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who defeated Poroshenko in the second round in April. In the July 2019 elections for the Ukrainian Rada, candidates for Zelenskyy&#x27;s Servant of the People Party won the city&#x27;s three parliamentary seats. However, in December 2020, the Servant of the People candidate for mayor, Dmytr Shevchuk, lost to Kostantin Pavlov of the pro-Russian Opposition Platform — For Life.

On 15 August 2021, Pavlov was found dead in the entrance to his home, a gun lying next to his body. In September, reporting on an investigation that included a search of the home of the former, and now acting, mayor, Yyriy Vilkul, the Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky suggested that Pavlov may have committed suicide against the backdrop of a large-scale audit of the city&#x27;s budget.

==== Labour protests ====
Beginning in 2017, Kryvyi Rih had major labour unrest. In May 2017, coordinated protest actions began at the city&#x27;s main plants, Kryvyi Rih Iron Ore Plant, Evraz-Sukha Balka and AMKR. Employees stopped work, held public meetings and occupied administration offices. Conscious that they were receiving one of the lowest wages across the global industry, the metalworkers raised the demand for a monthly wage of US$1,000/Euros. The conflict stopped after an agreement was reached to gradually raise wages, on average by 50%. In 2018, protest erupted again triggered by the fatal result of underinvestment in plant and safety. On the night of 3–4 March 2018, the roof collapsed at AMKR&#x27;s converter shop, killing a 25-year-old worker.

In May, the ArcelorMittal steel plant ground to a halt as workers refused to guide trains along the factory&#x27;s self-enclosed supply chain until they received monthly pay of 1,000 euros. Management brought in employees from state-owned railway company Ukrzaliznytsia to run the factory, breaking the strike but leaving the central dispute in place. An underlying problem, according to ArcelorMittal&#x27;s chief procurement officer, is a labour shortage. Skilled workers are emigrating to Poland, Czechia, and to other countries. But the plant&#x27;s upper management sees costs associated with the higher salaries that might retain workers as an unacceptable threat to an ambitious, multibillion-dollar factory modernization project.

Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine&#x27;s largest integrated steel company, had been privatised in 2005 in publicly televised auction. This was after the incoming government of President Viktor Yushchenko cancelled a 2004 auction that had seen the company sold at a much lower price, to a consortium that included the son-in-law of ex-President Leonid Kuchma. The Indian-owned international steel conglomerate Mittal Steel proved successful with a bid of $4.8 billion, equivalent to a fifth of Ukraine&#x27;s national budget. In 2006, Mittal took over its international rival, Arcelor, to form ArcelorMittal headquartered in Luxembourg City. Over the next five years, the company said it invested more than $5 billion in its Kryvyi Rih operations.

On 15 October 2020, in an action that began with 393 miners occupying mine-shafts, 18 iron-ore miners came to the surface after spending a total of 43 days underground to protest pay and conditions. The mine administration had introduced piecework wages for most jobs underground, linking people&#x27;s daily income to the amount of ore mined. In response to this, and to above-ground worker blockades, plant management made concessions on wages, benefits and health and safety.

==== Russian invasion ====

On the first day of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, 24 February 2022, there were air strikes against military targets in the city, causing evacuations of residents in the district of Makulan.

On 27 February, city mayor Oleksandr Vilkul was appointed the head of the military administration of Kryvyi Rih. According to Vilkul, the day previously — the second day the war — the Russian military had attempted an air assault. An Ilyushin Il 76 transport had approached an abandoned Soviet-era air base just east of the city. Carrying more than 100 paratroopers with orders to capture the airfield as an “air bridge”, it was forced to abort its mission, 300 metres from landing. As soon as the city had been hit with missiles, local defenders had blocked the runway with mechanical equipment. On the same day, Vilkul said that he had received a phone call from a former colleague who invited him to &quot;sign an agreement of friendship, cooperation and defense with Russia&quot;; he said that he &quot;responded with profanity.&quot;

On the third day of the war, 27 February, the Russian forces, according to Vilkul, sent a column of 300 military vehicles from their advancing position to the south, and that after ten days of intense fighting they were turned back. As an industrial center that accounted for fully 10% of Ukraine&#x27;s GDP, Vilkul was convinced that Kryvyi Rih was a prime target for Russian forces.

In the third week of the war, Russian troops broadened their offensive across Ukraine and were again advancing toward Kryvyi Rih from the south. On 10 March, two rockets struck the Kryvyi Rih International Airport in . On 12 March, Metinvest shuttered an open pit iron ore mine in the city, and sent the huge trucks used at the mine to block key roads to slow the Russian advance. In its 15 March briefing, the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence stated that the movement by &quot;occupation troops&quot; toward Kryvyi Rih had been stopped.

According to Russian sources, the invaders faced extensive improvised fortifications and minefields. On 29 March 2022, Vilkul said that the line of contact was no longer on the border with Dnipropetrovsk region, but 40-60 kilometers south in the Kherson Oblast. He was confident that running 120 km north to south, the longest city in Europe could not be surrounded.
On 30 March, ArcelorMittal which at the beginning of the month had idled its steelmaking operations in Kryvyi Rih citing concern for the safety and security of its 26,000 workers and for its assets, announced that it was preparing to restart production. (It 2023, it operated at 25% pre-war capacity. In 2024, the company plans to increase capacity utilization from to 50%).

At the end of May 2022, responding to Russian rocket and missile strikes, Ukrainian forces made limited counterattacks south of Kryvyi Rih. The southern Inhulets and Radushne districts remain exposed to Russian shelling with civilian losses. At dawn on 25 August, Kryvyi Rih was hit by cluster munitions.

On 14 September 2022, the city faced rising water levels in the Inhulets River, and water shortages, as the Russian forces fired eight cruise missiles at local infrastructure. The strike against President Zelenskyy&#x27;s home town—an attempt, he suggested, to flood the city—came after his visit to towns in the Kharkiv region regained in Ukraine&#x27;s first major counteroffensive.

==Government==
The city of Kryvyi Rih is governed by the Kryvyi Rih Municipality. It is a city community that is designated as a separate district within its oblast.

Administratively, the city is divided into districts (&quot;raions&quot;). There are 7 districts: Metalurhiinyi, Tsentralno-Miskyi, Ternivskyi, Saksahanskyi, Inhuletskyi, Pokrovskyi and Dovhyntsivskyi. Small townships, Avanhard, Horniatske, Ternuvatyi Kut, Kolomiitseve and Novoivanivka were added to the city.

In 1775, the Inhulets Povit (territory) of Novorossiysk Governorate was established on lands of the Inhulets palanca, after the abolition of the Zaporozhian Sich. In 1775/1776 it was part of Kherson Governorate. In 1783, the povit centre became Kryvyi Rih, and it was renamed &quot;Kryvyi Rih Povit&quot;. In 1860, Kryvyi Rih received the status of township within the Kherson Governorate. In 1919, the township was granted city status in Yekaterinoslav Governorate and, later, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. As a result of the administrative reform in 1923, Kryvyi Rih povit converted to Kryvyi Rih county. In 1930, it became an independent administrative
unit of Ukraine.

Kryvyi Rih has four single-mandate parliamentary constituencies entirely within the city, through which members of parliament (MPs) are elected to represent the city in Ukraine&#x27;s national parliament. At the 2014 Ukrainian parliamentary election, they were won by Petro Poroshenko Bloc and independent candidates with representation being from Yuri Pavlov, Andriy Halchenko, Konstantin Usov respectively.

In multimember districts, the city voted for the Opposition Bloc, a union of all political forces that did not endorse Euromaidan. At the 2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election, three local MPs were representing Servant of the People, the party of Ukrainian President and Kryvyi Rih native Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and one independent candidate, Dmytro Shpenov.

==Culture==

Kryvyi Rih has a thriving theatre, circus and dance scene, and is home to a number of large performance venues. There are also the Doll Theatre and Movement Theatre.
The first theater was the Coliseum, built in 1908. The New Theatre of Vyzenberh and Hrushevskyy followed in 1911, at the corner of Lenina and Kalynychenko streets. Kryvbas Theatre began its activities in 1931, and three years later was incorporated with the Shevchenko Theater.

Kryvyi Rih is noted as the birthplace Eugenie Gershoy. She emigrated to the United States with her family in 1903, and there became an American sculptor and watercolorist. Gershoy&#x27;s work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Her papers are held at Syracuse University. Indie band Brunettes Shoot Blondes, folk musician Eduard Drach, actress Helena Makowska, and dancer Vladimir Malakhov originated from the city.

The first film screenings were conducted in the city in the early 1920s. In 1934 Lenin Cinema was built. Today there are three movie theaters: Olympus, Odessa and Multiplex. The Kryvyi Rih Circus features large-scale exhibition space where fairs are held. A remnant of Soviet heritage are Palaces of Culture, located in every district of the city.

The local historical museum celebrates Cossack history, the industrial heritage of the area and its role in the Soviet State. The municipally owned Art Gallery houses a collection of local paintings.

The nightlife of the city has expanded significantly since the 2000s. Big clubs such as Hollywood and Sky have attracted touring DJs and pop and rap performers. Another major scene of the city is the Palace of Youth and Students of the Kryvyi Rih National University (KNU). The most popular fast-food, McDonald&#x27;s, is located at Kvartal 95 neighborhood.

Ukrainian cuisine is found adjacent to a range of Jewish and popular American foods: bagels, cheesecake, hot dogs, shawarma and pizza. Japanese cuisine and other Asian restaurants, hookahs, sandwich joints, trattorias and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous. Other well-known places include City Pub and Prado Cafe. The city is home to the annual electronic music Turbofly festival. Rock music, a tradition in Ukraine, is an important part of the city&#x27;s life and is hosted in few small pubs.
==Landmarks==
Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s buildings display a variety of architectural styles, ranging from eclecticism to contemporary architecture. The widespread use of red brick and block apartments characterize the city. Much of the architecture in the city was built during its prosperous days as a center for the ore trade. Just outside the immediate city center is a large number of former factories. Some have been totally destroyed. Others are in desperate need of restoration.

Stalinist architecture was the predominant style of postwar apartments, of 5 to 7 stories. City Hall is the best example of The decree On liquidation of excesses. Khrushchyovka are a type of low-cost, concrete-paneled or brick three- to five-storied apartment building which was developed in the USSR during the early 1960s. They are named after Nikita Khrushchev, then premier of the Soviet government. Dozens of these aging buildings around the city are now past their design lifetime.

Kryvyi Rih has six microdistricts.

The city has many Christian churches, the most notable being the Savior Transfiguration Cathedral of the Ukrainian Orthodox church in union with the Russian Orthodox Church. It is the base of the Kryvyi Rih Eparchy, which was established in July 1996. A Roman Catholic chapel located in the old town, Pokrova church, Mykhailivska church and Christmas church were destroyed in the 1930s during the Great Purge, never to be used as a church again. Beside the Russian jurisdiction, in 2009 to 2011 there existed parallel eparchy of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine (as the Ukrainian Orthodox Church – Kyivan Patriarchate). Domination of the pro-Russian political party Party of Regions in Kryvyi Rih expelled that organization.

In 2010, the Jewish community built a new, large synagogue.

Large parks hold many of Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s public monuments. There are numerous socialist realism-style monuments installed in the Soviet years to honor Cossacks, Olexander Paul, Taras Shevchenko (2), Bohdan Khmelnytsky (3, since 1954), Vasili Marguelov, Alexander Pushkin, Fyodor Sergeyev, Mikhail Lermontov, and Maxim Gorky. The few Lenin monuments were destroyed during euromaidan events in 2014. Dozens of cenotaphs and memorials to Second World War soldiers were erected. A Sukhoi Su-15 is on display near the Aviator Club, a Yakovlev Yak-40 at the National Aviation University, Vyzvolennia Square holds a IS3 tank, and a Russian locomotive class Ye is placed near the Railway station.
Kryvyi Rih has few designated natural monuments: the old pear near Karnavatka, another pear of 1789, Vizyrka landscape reserve, Northern and Southern Red Beam, Amphibolite, Arkose and Skelevatski Outputs, Mopr Rocks, Slate rocks, Sandstone rock. A park named after the newspaper Pravda is very famous for its ampir boat station. Kryvyi Rih Botanical Gardens of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (NAS) was established in 1980.

==Geography==
Located south of Kyiv, the city is the biggest by size within the Central Ukraine and being situated in the right-bank portion of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. In addition, the city is located right on the conditional border where Dnieper Upland transitions to Black Sea Lowland. The Dnieper Upland is part of the Ukrainian Crystalline Shield which in the region contains number of heavy metal deposits such as iron and uranium ores and hard rock deposits like granite. Combination of the crystalline shield with the near flowing river of Dnieper causes the plain-relief river looking as mountainous and running through rapids (Dnieper rapids).

Also, the city is often claimed to be the longest in Europe. It is said up to 100 km or even from north to south. While the city is strikingly elongated on a map, in reality the greatest distance between two points within city limits is 66.1 km. The longer figures result from drawing a line precisely following the heavily indented city limits from north to south.

The city area is not contiguous, with part of the Inhulets District being an exclave to the city proper. There isn&#x27;t a continuous built up area along the full length of the city. Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s shape is influenced by the ore deposits which lie parallel to it and which have been the city&#x27;s mining mainstay. The city centre is on the east bank of the Inhulets River, near its confluences with its tributary river Saksahan. Both Inhulets and Saksahan change their river course in the area often bending in each direction. The confluence of the river Saksahan with the Inhulets supposedly gave the name for the city by forming a geographical crooked horn (&quot;kryvyi rih&quot;).

The city is set in the rolling steppe land surrounded by fields of sunflowers and grain. A short distance east of the city center, there is an area along a small lake where glacial boulders were deposited. As a result, this area was never cultivated and contains one of the few remaining patches of wild steppe vegetation in the area. The city&#x27;s environmental and construction safety is a growing problem due to abandoned mines and polluted ore-processing waste.

===Climate===
Kryvyi Rih has a dry warm hot-summer continental climate (&quot;Dfa&quot;) within to the Köppen climate classification system, like much of southern Ukraine. This tends to generate warm summers and cold winters with relatively low precipitation. Snowfalls are not common in the city, due to the urban warming effect. Districts that surround the city receive more snow and roads leading out of the city can be closed due to snow.
==Demographics==
Historically, the population of Kryvyi Rih began to increase rapidly during the Interwar period, peaking at 197,000 in 1939. From then the population began to decrease rapidly. Foreign workers arrived, and there was increased building of social housing estates by the Kryvyi Rih City Council after the Second World War, such as Sotsmisto and Soniachnyi.

The 2014 estimate for the population of Kryvyi Rih was 654,900 (8th in Ukraine). This was a decrease of 4,348 since the 2013 estimate. Since 2001, the population has grown by 48,001. In 2013, deaths exceeded births by 3,589. The net migration rate is 234 (negative).

Kryvyi Rih historically had a Christian majority-population. It has numerous churches, particularly in the city centre. The well-known Saviour Transfiguration Cathedral in Saksahan Raion is an Orthodox administrative centre, and the bishop of the Kryvyi Rih Eparchy has his main residence here. The town has a school of icon painting. The patron saint of the city is Saint Nicholas, as well as bishops Onufry and Porphyry.

This was long a centre of Jewish population. Its Central Synagogue was the tallest building in town in the late 19th century. The majority of the region&#x27;s Jews live here, and a significant Jewish community has been re-established. Beis Shtern Shtulman Synagogue opened in 2010 in the city centre. In the early twentieth century, the city had two synagogues, located on Kaunas street. As part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Kharkiv-Zaporizhzhia, the city has the Kostel of Mary Mother of Jesus. Kryvyi Rih is also home to Evangelical Christians, CEF, and Vedas communities.

In terms of ethnicity, ethnic Ukrainians account for the majority of the local population. Jews constituted one of the largest ethnic minorities. As of 2018, approximately 71% of Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s residents were ethnic Ukrainians and 27% ethnic Russians.

Large immigrant groups include people from Korea, Poland, Moldova and Azerbaijan, as well as Assyrians and Roms. Numerous African students come to the city to attend local universities. Central city and Dovhuntsevskyi Raion are centres of population for ethnic minorities.

The Kryvyi Rih Metropolitan Region (KMR) had a population over 1,010,000 in 2010. In addition to Kryvyi Rih, the KMR (factually) includes far more than five raions, and numerous territories in central and southern parts of Ukraine. The KMR is the sixth-largest within Ukraine.
=== 2001 census ===

Processing and the mining industry - are the two largest sectors of Kryvyi Rih&#x27;s economy. Rest fraction is about 50%. The city has over 53 plants, mines and factories. ArcelorMittal Kryvyi Rih, owned by ArcelorMittal since 2005, is the largest private company by revenue in Ukraine, producing over 7 million tonnes of crude steel, and mined over 17 million tonnes of iron ore. As of 2011, the company employed about 37 000 people. The 4 Iron Ore Enrichment Works of Metinvest are a large contributors to the UA&#x27;s balance of payments. Other giants of the city are the Evraz mining company and HeidelbergCement.

Local public transportation in Kryvyi Rih includes the Metrotram (subway), buses and minibus lines, trolleybuses (in operation since 1957, the system presently comprises 23 routes), trams (one of the world&#x27;s largest tram networks, operating on of total route; as of 2014, it was composed of 13 lines) and, taxi.

The publicly owned and operated Kryvyi Rih Metrotram is the fastest, the most convenient and affordable network that covers most, but not all, of the city. The Metrotram is continuously expanding towards the city limits to meet growing demand, currently has two lines with a total length of and 11 stations. Despite its designation as a &quot;metro tram&quot; and its use of tram cars as rolling stock, the Kryvyi Rih Metrotram is a complete rapid transit system with enclosed stations and tracks separated both from roads and from the city&#x27;s conventional tram lines.
City public transport serviced 66m persons in the first part of 2014.

In May 2021, Kryvyi Rih became the first city in Ukraine to introduce free travel in public transport for its citizens. In order not to pay for municipal transport one must show a special electronic &quot;Kryvyi Rih Card&quot;.

The historic tram system, once a well maintained and widely used method of transport, is now gradually being phased out in favor of buses and trolleybuses.

The taxi system is expansive but not regulated. In particular, the taxi fare per kilometer is not regulated. There is a fierce competition between private taxi companies.

Kryvyi Rih International Airport is the airport that serves the city. It is located 17.5 km (10.9 Miles) northwest of the city of Kryvyi Rih.

<text>Loch Leven (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Loch Lìobhann&quot;) is a sea loch located onto the west coast of Scotland. It is spelled &quot;Loch Lyon&quot; in Timothy Pont&#x27;s map of the area and is pronounced Li&#x27; un. However, the local Gaelic pronunciation is Lee&#x27; oon
Loch Leven extends , varying in width between and just over . It opens onto Camus a&#x27; Chois at North Ballachulish, part of Loch Linnhe at its western end. There are nine small islands, some rocky and covered with heather and some just smooth green grass, near the western end of the loch.

The village of Glencoe () lies on its southern shore. The burial place of the MacDonald clan of Glencoe lies on an island - Eilean Munde, St.Munda&#x27;s or St Munn&#x27;s or Saint Fintan Munnu&#x27;s Island, opposite the village. The island burial place was also shared by the Camerons of Callart, which is on the north shore of the loch, the Stewarts of Ballachulish and Appin and other local families.

The village of Kinlochleven at the head of the loch was established when the aluminium smelter was built there during the first decade of the twentieth century. It was originally the hamlets of Kinlochmore (Inverness-shire) and Kinlochbeg (Argyll) either side of the River Leven. A road connecting the village to Glencoe and the south was not constructed until 1922: until this date the village could only be reached from the south by boat or on foot. The road on the north of the loch continues on to Fort William (), and was built in 1927.

For many years the Ballachulish Ferry plied the route across the mouth of the loch, providing a key link on the A82 between Glasgow and Fort William. In 1975 the Ballachulish Bridge replaced the ferry. Under the bridge lie the narrows of Caolas Mhic Phàdraig. The settlements either side of this point are North and South Ballachulish - Baile a&#x27; Chaolais (the settlement on the narrows). There is a fast tidal stream through the narrows, running at up to seven knots at springs; it is wise, therefore, to time and match any passage through the narrows with the tides. Further up the loch, there are several other narrows - principally Caolas na Con - with significant, but diminishing tidal streams. The Caolas na Con represented a considerable barrier to shipping, restricting the size of vessels that could reach Kinlochleven, however in 1907 the channel was dredged and the silt-bearing Allt Gleann a&#x27; Chaolais diverted to allow ships bringing bauxite alumina to reach the smelter at Kinlochleven.

<text>Leslie Copus Peltier (January 2, 1900 – May 10, 1980) was an American amateur astronomer and discoverer of several comets and novae, including Nova Herculis 1963. He was once described as &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest non-professional astronomer&quot; by Harlow Shapley.

== Biography ==

Leslie Copus Peltier was born in Delphos, Ohio. Delphos is located in northwestern Ohio in both Van Wert and Allen County. His homeplace was located on South Bredeick Street, and his home is still standing today. The home was known as Brookhaven. Peltier married Dorothy Nihiser in November 1933. An amateur astronomer, he was a prolific discoverer of comets and also a persistent observer of variable stars and member of the AAVSO. He was co-discoverer of 12 comets, 10 of which carry his name, and over a span of more than 60 years made more than 132,000 variable star observations.

He wrote the autobiographical &quot;Starlight Nights&quot; (), which evokes the magic of stargazing in simpler days, on a farm and without light pollution.

Main-belt asteroid 3850 Peltier is named in his honor, as is the Leslie C. Peltier Award of the Astronomical League.

==Publications==
Peltier authored the following books:

* &quot;Starlight Nights: The Adventures of a Star-Gazer&quot; (1965); also published in Japanese as &quot;Hoshi No Kuru Yoru&quot; (1985)
* &quot;Guideposts to the Stars: Exploring the Skies Throughout the Year&quot; (1972); also published in Dutch as &quot;Spectrum Sterrengids&quot; (1976) and as &quot;Prisma Sterrengids&quot; (1979)
* &quot;The Place on Jennings Creek&quot; (1977)
* &quot;Leslie Peltier&#x27;s Guide to the Stars&quot; (1986)
* &quot;The Binocular Stargazer: A Beginner&#x27;s Guide to Exploring the Sky&quot; (1995)

<text>Radha Rani Amber Indigo Ananda Mitchell (born 12 November 1973) is an Australian actress. She began her career on television, playing Catherine O&#x27;Brien on the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot; (1996–1997), before transitioning to working in Hollywood. Known for her work in the action and thriller genres, she is the recipient of an FCCA Award, as well as nominations for Fangoria Chainsaw, AFI, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

Mitchell&#x27;s credits include supporting and leading roles in films such as &quot;High Art&quot; (1998), &quot;Pitch Black&quot; (2000), &quot;Phone Booth&quot; (2002), &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; (all 2004), &quot;Mozart and the Whale&quot; (2005), &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (2006), &quot;Rogue&quot; (2007), &quot;Surrogates&quot;, &quot;The Waiting City&quot; (both 2009), &quot;The Crazies&quot; (2010), &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot; (2013), &quot;London Has Fallen&quot; (2016), &quot;The Darkness&quot; (2016), &quot;The Shack&quot; (2017), &quot;Celeste&quot; (2018), and &quot;Blueback&quot; (2022). Outside film, she played the recurring role of Kelly on ABC Television&#x27;s &quot;Troppo&quot; (2022).

==Early life==
She credits her name as being a result of her mother&#x27;s experiences in India during the 1970s and her fascination with Indian philosophies. She grew up in Melbourne, just around the corner from the Como Centre—a multi-storey office, retail cinema and hotel complex, featuring the headquarters of Channel 10 Television—on Chapel Street, where her mother ran a shop. Mitchell attended St Michael&#x27;s Grammar School in St Kilda. Her first credited screen role was that of an eleven-year-old girl from the Australian bush sent to live with her grandmother, on the ABC TV children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot;, which was broadcast between 1988 and 1989. Her experience in the series, along with the drama course she took at St Michael&#x27;s, sparked her interest in acting. She then enrolled at Swinburne University of Technology, with the idea of becoming a psychologist. &quot;I thought it was going to be group therapy, that we would go in there and talk about life and people and stuff like that. But it was all rats and stats. I didn&#x27;t last beyond the first year.&quot; Instead, she obtained her Bachelor of Arts in literature and media studies.

==Career==
===1990s===
Mitchell played a recurring character in the sitcom &quot;All Together Now&quot; (1992–1993) and guest-starred in &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1993), &quot;Law of the Land&quot; (1993) and &quot;Blue Heelers&quot; (1994–96). After obtaining a ten-episode arc as a parachute instructor in &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 1994, Mitchell returned to play the regular role of Catherine O&#x27;Brien, a strong-minded and opinionated student, from 1996 to 1997. The series brought the actress to a wider exposure from audiences.

Mitchell quickly &quot;established herself as a versatile and accomplished fixture on the moody art-house flick circuit&quot;. As noted by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she launched &quot;her assault on the indie scene by &#x27;cornering the market on the lesbian ingenue&#x27;&quot;. Her film debut came in the role of a gay University of Melbourne film student in the romantic comedy &quot;Love and Other Catastrophes&quot; (1996), which grossed US$1.6 million at the Australian box office. It was her next project, Lisa Cholodenko&#x27;s Independent Spirit Award-winning independent drama &quot;High Art&quot; (1998), alongside Ally Sheedy, that gave Mitchell her first impression on American audiences. She was acclaimed for her performance of a young female intern at a magazine company who becomes involved with a drug-addicted lesbian photographer. Roger Ebert wrote that &quot;&quot;High Art&quot; is so perceptive and mature it makes similar films seem flippant. The performances are on just the right note, scene after scene, for what needs to be done ...&quot;. IndieWire listed it as #7 of &quot;The 15 Greatest Lesbian Movies of All Time&quot;, while Autostraddle listed it as #31 of &quot;100 Best Lesbian Movies Of All Time&quot; in 2015. She played one half of a house sitting couple in the psychological drama &quot;Cleopatra&#x27;s Second Husband&quot; (also 1998).

In 1999, Mitchell starred as the former girlfriend of a lesbian make-up artist in the short drama &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot; and as the pampered, bratty girlfriend of a champion rugby player in the drama &quot;Kick&quot;. While &quot;Sleeping Beauties&quot; premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and went on to play at over thirty film festivals, &quot;Kick&quot; had a brief cinema screening in Europe before it was released on DVD.

===2000s===

Mitchell was cast as Carolyn Fry, a docking pilot, in the science fiction horror film &quot;Pitch Black&quot; (2000), opposite Vin Diesel. She found the experience of acting in a studio film &quot;physically challenging&quot;, but was eager to take on the role, explaining: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s an interesting script, great character, shot in Australia, get to go home, you know, a whole range of reasons. And because I guess it&#x27;s not something I would often have the opportunity to do; it&#x27;s a genre piece and I felt it was an opportunity to learn&quot;. Despite mixed reviews from critics, the film was a sleeper hit, grossing over US$53 million worldwide and developing its own cult following. In 2000, she also starred as an expecting mother in the psychological drama &quot;Everything Put Together&quot;, which was nominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival, and as the love interest of a lawyer in the romantic comedy &quot;Cowboys and Angels&quot;.

In 2001, Mitchell played a woman giving monologues to camera in the drama &quot;Ten Tiny Love Stories&quot;, a diner waitress in the comedy &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Baby&quot; and the owner of a remote roadside diner in the thriller &quot;When Strangers Appear&quot;. Her next film release was the crime drama &quot;Dead Heat&quot; (2002), in which she played the wife of a police officer. Joel Schumacher&#x27;s thriller &quot;Phone Booth&quot; (2003), opposite Colin Farrell, featured her as the wife of a young arrogant publicist who becomes a victim of a mysterious caller who threatens to harm him. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$97.8 million worldwide. She starred as the first woman to sail around the world solo in the horror film &quot;Visitors&quot; (also 2003).

Her three 2004 film releases —&quot;Man on Fire&quot; (2004), with Denzel Washington, the Academy Award–winning &quot;Finding Neverland&quot;, with Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet, and Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot;— were well received by critics and successful at the box office. In &quot;Man on Fire&quot;, she played the mother of a nine-year-old abducted in Mexico City and what &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; described as an &quot;American trophy wife with a Southern accent that seems to come and go&quot;. &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; featured her as Mary Ansell, the wife of novelist J.M. Barrie, and earned her, as a member of the cast, a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture. &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; starred her as the title role of a woman attempting to straighten out her life. &quot;Man on Fire&quot; made US$130.2 million, &quot;Finding Neverland&quot; $116.8 million, and &quot;Melinda and Melinda&quot; US$20 million in limited markets.

In &quot;Mozart and the Whale&quot; (2005), a romantic dramedy with Josh Hartnett, Mitchell played a woman with Asperger syndrome. In its review for the film, &quot;Variety&quot; noted: &quot;Mitchell socks over her role as a dynamo whose emotional insecurity is buried under a fabulously attractive exterior; by virtue of her character&#x27;s assertiveness, she dominates the screen&quot;.

In &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (2006), the adaptation of Konami&#x27;s 1999 video game of the same name, Mitchell portrayed Rose Da Silva, the desperate mother who seeks a cure for her daughter Sharon&#x27;s nightmarish sleepwalking by taking her to the town of Silent Hill. James Berardinelli noted: &quot;Radha Mitchell normally does smaller movies, but her experience from &quot;Pitch Black&quot; serves her well here; she&#x27;s credible as a mother who will fight off hoards of dead to save her daughter&quot;. Despite mixed reviews, the film opened with top numbers at the box office, with over US$20 million in sales. It eventually made US$97 million globally. In 2006, she also appeared as the adoring wife of a nuclear reprocessing facility worker in the HBO film &quot;Pu-239&quot;.

In 2007, Mitchell starred in Robert Benton&#x27;s romantic dramedy &quot;Feast of Love&quot;, opposite Greg Kinnear and Morgan Freeman, as a successful realtor carrying on an affair with a married man, and in the horror film &quot;Rogue&quot;, with Michael Vartan, as a wildlife researcher fighting a giant, man-eating crocodile. Both &quot;Feast of Love&quot; and &quot;Rogue&quot; made about US$5 million worldwide. In 2008, she took on the roles of a mother to a mute seven-year old in the dramedy &quot;Henry Poole Is Here&quot; opposite Luke Wilson, and that of a courageous nurse assisting British journalist George Hogg in the historical war drama &quot;The Children of Huang Shi&quot; opposite Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. In 2009, she played a woman kidnapped by the Russian mafia in the heist action film &quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; (aka &quot;The Code&quot;), which reunited her with Morgan Freeman, and in the sci-fi thriller &quot;Surrogates&quot;, also as an FBI agent, a film adaptation of the comic book of the same name co-starring Bruce Willis.

===2010s===
The horror film &quot;The Crazies&quot; (2010) featured Mitchell as a pregnant woman and one of the residents of a fictional Iowa town that becomes afflicted by a military virus that turns those infected into violent killers. The film garnered positive reviews and, with a worldwide gross of US$55 million, it emerged as a moderate commercial success. In 2010, she also starred as a successful, self-starting lawyer and one half of a couple trying to adopt a child in Claire McCarthy&#x27;s drama &quot;The Waiting City&quot;, which was acclaimed by critics. &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; asserted: &quot;Featuring standout performances from Mitchell and Edgerton, this is an example of what Australian films can and should be, thought provoking, entertaining and stunning to behold&quot;. For her role, Mitchell won as Best Actress at the Antipodes Film Festival in Saint Tropez, France.

Mitchell reprised her role of Rose Da Silva in &quot;Silent Hill: Revelation&quot; (2012), which was a moderate box office success, grossing over US$56 million worldwide, but was heavily panned by critics and audiences, Her next seven screen projects —the films &quot;Big Sur&quot;, &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;, &quot;Evidence&quot;, &quot;The Frozen Ground&quot;, &quot;Standing Up&quot;, &quot;Expecting&quot; and the ABC drama series &quot;Red Widow&quot;— were released throughout 2013. &quot;Olympus Has Fallen&quot;, in which she portrayed a nurse and the wife of a Secret Service agent, proved to be her most successful film of the year, grossing US$170.3 million globally, and spawning a film trilogy. In &quot;Fugly!&quot; (2014), a comedy written by and starring John Leguizamo, Mitchell played a neurotic uptown girl and the love interest of an unattractive man rejected by women because of his donkey-faced appearance.

In &quot;Looking for Grace&quot; (2015), a drama screened in the main competition section of the 72nd Venice International Film Festival, Mitchell starred as a mother hiring a private detective in an attempt to find her missing daughter. Her comic portrayal was hailed as &quot;amusingly tetchy&quot; by &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;well-tuned&quot; by &quot;Time Out Sydney&quot;.

In 2016, Mitchell returned to the &quot;Fallen&quot; trilogy in &quot;London Has Fallen&quot;, which made US$205.9 million, and took on the roles of the matriarch of a family who brings home a supernatural force from the Grand Canyon in the horror film &quot;The Darkness&quot;, an obstetrician living in the remote Shetland Islands in the thriller &quot;Sacrifice&quot;, as well as that of one half of a couple in the short film &quot;Whoever Was Using This Bed&quot;. The Christian drama &quot;The Shack&quot; (2017), which featured Mitchell as a devoutly religious wife, opened with US$16.1 million in North America, finishing above expectations. It eventually earned US$96.9 million worldwide.

In August 2024, Mitchell was named in the cast of Disney Plus series &quot;Last Days of the Space Age.&quot;

<text>Foxboro Stadium, originally Schaefer Stadium and later Sullivan Stadium, was an outdoor stadium in the New England region of the United States, located in Foxborough, Massachusetts. It opened in 1971 and served as the home of the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL) for 31 seasons (through January 2002) and also as the first home venue for the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer (MLS) from 1996 to 2002. The stadium was the site of several games in both the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, and hosted a wide variety of other events, particularly concerts. Foxboro Stadium was demolished in 2002 and replaced by Gillette Stadium and the Patriot Place shopping center.

==History==
The stadium opened in August 1971 as Schaefer primarily as the home venue for the renamed New England Patriots of the National Football League. The team was known as the Boston Patriots for its first eleven seasons 1960–70, and had played in various stadiums in the Boston area. For six seasons, 1963–68, the Patriots played in Fenway Park, home of baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox. Like most baseball stadiums, Fenway was poorly suited as a football venue. Its seating capacity was inadequate—only about 40,000 for football—and many seats had obstructed views. With the completion of the AFL–NFL merger in , the league required its teams to play in stadiums which seated more than 50,000, and no venue in Boston proper could accommodate a crowd this size with the NFL&#x27;s then-new requirements. Indeed, before the Patriots arrived, numerous previous attempts at pro football in Boston had been stymied by the lack of a pro-caliber stadium. (The Redskins left for Washington, D.C. after the 1936 season, in which they hosted the NFL Championship Game, not in Boston but at the Polo Grounds in New York City.)

The then-Boston Patriots played the 1969 season at Alumni Stadium at Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and the 1970 season, their first in the NFL, at Harvard Stadium in Boston&#x27;s Allston neighborhood.

The site was selected when the owners of Bay State Raceway donated the land, midway between Boston and Providence, Rhode Island. The general contractor who built the stadium was a Massachusetts-based company named J. F. White Contracting Co.

Ground was broken in September 1970, and it cost $7.1 million, only $200,000 over budget. Even allowing for this modest cost overrun, it was still a bargain price for a major sports stadium even by 1970s standards. This was because the Patriots received no funding from the governments of either the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or the town of Foxborough; indeed, it was one of the few major league stadiums of that era that was entirely privately funded.

===Seating capacity===
==Playing surface==
Like the majority of outdoor sports venues built in North America in the 1970s, Foxboro Stadium was designed for the use of an artificial turf playing surface. The original field was Poly-Turf, succeeded by AstroTurf. A natural grass field was installed before the start of the 1991 season.

==Naming rights==
The original name in 1971 was Schaefer Stadium for the brewery of that name in an early example of the sale of naming rights to a company that did not own the stadium. When this agreement expired after the 1982 season, Anheuser-Busch took over the rights. Instead of putting the name of one of its brands of beer on the stadium, Anheuser-Busch agreed to name it in honor of the Sullivan family, then the majority owners of the Patriots. The name Sullivan Stadium took effect on May 23, 1983. After Sullivan went bankrupt and Robert Kraft purchased the stadium, Kraft stripped Sullivan&#x27;s name and renamed the venue &quot;Foxboro Stadium&quot;. Although the official spelling of the town&#x27;s name is &quot;Foxborough&quot;, the shorter spelling was used for the stadium.

During the ownership of Victor Kiam, ESPN anchor Chris Berman humorously referred to the facility as &quot;Shaver Stadium&quot;, a pun on Kiam&#x27;s fame from Remington razor commercials and the stadium&#x27;s original name.

==Notable events==
===Soccer===
The venue hosted numerous significant soccer matches, including six games in the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Foxboro Stadium was the last stadium where Diego Maradona scored a World Cup goal in a game against Greece, and where he last played in an official FIFA World Cup match against Nigeria on June 25, 1994.

The stadium hosted five games in the 1999 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the 1996 and 1999 MLS Cups, and the inaugural Women&#x27;s United Soccer Association Founders Cup.

The stadium&#x27;s final soccer match was the qualifying match between the United States and Jamaica, which the United States won 2-1.

=== College football ===

==== Holy Cross Crusaders ====
During the final week of the 1971 season, Holy Cross moved its home game against rival Boston College to the newly-constructed Schaefer Stadium, due to a heavy snowstorm that rendered Fitton Field in Worcester unplayable.

==== Boston College Eagles ====
In the opening week of the 1975 season, Boston College hosted Notre Dame at Schaefer Stadium in their first ever meeting. From 1983 through 1987, BC used Schaefer/Sullivan Stadium as an alternate home venue to host crowds larger than could be accommodated on campus at Alumni Stadium.
===Other events===
The stadium hosted numerous other outdoor events, primarily concerts, along with music festivals, including The Monsters of Rock Festival Tour and The Vans Warped Tour, as well as the WWF King of the Ring tournament on July 8, 1985 and July 14, 1986.
U2 played on The Joshua Tree Tour on September 22, 1987, and later performed three nights of their Zoo TV Tour on August 20, 22, and 23, 1992.
Schaefer Stadium hosted Elton John on July 4, 1976, as well as Boz Scaggs, The Eagles, and Fleetwood Mac on July 25, 1976.

Sullivan Stadium hosted The Who&#x27;s 25th anniversary tour on July 12 and 14, 1989.

Paul McCartney brought the Flowers In the Dirt Tour to the stadium on July 24 and 26, 1990.

New Kids on The Block brought The Magic Summer Tour to the stadium on July 29 and July 31, 1990. An audience of 53,000 people attended one of two concert dates.

Genesis brought the We Can&#x27;t Dance Tour to the stadium on May 28, 1992.

Metallica and Guns N&#x27; Roses brought the Guns N&#x27; Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour to the stadium on September 11, 1992, with Faith No More as their opening act.

Elton John performed at the venue in front of 62,000 on US Bicentennial on July 4, 1976. John again appeared in a Face to Face concert with Billy Joel on July 18, 1994.

Madonna performed her &quot;Who&#x27;s That Girl&quot; tour there on July 9, 1987, to a sell-out crowd. Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead recorded a portion of their collaborative live album, entitled &quot;Dylan &amp; the Dead&quot;, there on July 4, 1987. Pink Floyd played a two-night stand in May 1988 (on one of the nights their inflatable pig was torn to shreds). They also played a three-night sold-out stand in May 1994 on their The Division Bell Tour which was recorded and readily available on bootleg. (The second night was filmed by MTV for promotional purposes.) The Dave Matthews Band played seven shows at the stadium from 1998 to 2001.

The Rolling Stones played three nights on September 27 and 29 and October 1, 1989, then two more nights on September 4 and 5, 1994 and lastly October 20 and 21, 1997.

Additionally, in 1994, the Drum Corps International World Championships were held in the stadium.

==Closing==
By the late 1990s, Foxboro Stadium had become functionally obsolete by modern NFL standards. Despite excellent sight lines to view game action or concerts and having fewer of the issues that multi-sport multi-purpose stadiums in other cities had, the stadium was otherwise outmoded. The facility was built in a low-cost &quot;bare bones&quot; manner with unexceptional architectural elements, and had very few modern amenities. The stadium&#x27;s plumbing was not designed with NFL-sized crowds in mind, which became evident when a sewage issue overflowed the restroom facilities during its first game. Stadium officials were forced to augment the permanent toilets with rented portable toilets for the rest of the stadium&#x27;s existence. It also lacked luxury boxes, an increasingly important source of revenue for other teams in the league. Only a small fraction of the seats had permanent chairbacks (painted blue, red and white near the 50-yard line). Most patrons had to sit on backless aluminum benches (or like still done in the lower Lambeau Field bowl today, rent or bring in their own stadium cushions and portable chairbacks) that often froze late in the season. During heavy rains, the numerous unpaved spots in the parking lot turned to mud. It frequently took an hour or more to leave after games, due to its location on a then-undivided four-lane portion of U.S. Route 1. In order to host the FIFA World Cup (and later, the New England Revolution), several rows of seats were removed to accommodate a soccer pitch with acceptable dimensions to FIFA.

With a capacity of just over 60,000 (only 10,000 above the NFL&#x27;s minimum seating capacity), it was one of the smallest stadiums in the NFL. It was also almost completely exposed to the elements, meaning that there was almost no protection for the fans in storms (outside of beneath the stands) or in extreme cold. Additionally, the Sullivan family had lost millions promoting the Jackson Victory Tour in 1984. Due to their relatively modest wealth compared to other NFL owners, they pledged the stadium as collateral for the tour. Knowing that the revenue from the Patriots would not be nearly enough to service the debt, the Sullivans quietly put the team and the stadium on the market.

The Sullivans&#x27; financial picture was so dire that even when the Patriots made Super Bowl XX, the team failed to bring in nearly enough money to service the debt from the Victory Tour. With most of their money tied up in the team, they sold controlling interest in the Patriots to Victor Kiam in 1989. The stadium, however, lapsed into bankruptcy and was bought by Boston paper magnate Robert Kraft in 1988.

When Kiam and Sullivan tried to sell the team to interests in Jacksonville, Kraft effectively stymied the deal by refusing to let the team out of their lease, which contained an ironclad commitment to play in the stadium until 2001. As a result, when Kiam himself was crippled by financial troubles, he sold the Patriots to James Orthwein in 1992. After only two years, Orthwein tried to move the Patriots to his hometown of St. Louis. However, as in 1992, Kraft refused to let the Patriots out of their lease. Orthwein then put the team on the market, but the wording of the operating covenant required any potential buyer to negotiate lease terms with Kraft. With this in mind, Kraft swooped in and bought the team himself. Two years later, Kraft bought the parcel of land containing neighboring Bay State Raceway, allowing him to build a new and privately-financed stadium on the raceway property after proposals to build a new stadium in Hartford, Connecticut and South Boston failed.

After 31 NFL seasons, Foxboro Stadium was scheduled to be demolished on December 23, 2001, the day after the Patriots&#x27; final home game. However, the stadium would instead play host to the first season of the Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era, with the team making a run to get into the playoffs and going on to win their first Super Bowl. As a result, the stadium was not demolished until late January 2002, after the conclusion of the 2001 postseason. The last game played in the stadium, the &quot;Tuck Rule Game&quot;, was played in a snow storm; it resulted in a Patriots win against the Oakland Raiders, which famously featured an overturned fumble call based on the then-applicable tuck rule in the final minutes. The stadium&#x27;s former site became parking lots for its successor, Gillette Stadium, before being developed into the open-air shopping center Patriot Place.

<doc id="624792" wikidata="Q6476209" url="?curid=624792" title="Lake Hopatcong">
<text>Lake Hopatcong is the largest freshwater body in New Jersey, United States, about in area. Located from the Delaware River and from Manhattan, New York City, the lake forms part of the border between Sussex and Morris counties in the state&#x27;s northern highlands region. 

Lake Hopatcong was produced by damming and flooding of two ponds, known as the Great Pond and Little Pond, and the Musconetcong River, its natural outlet. Historically known as a resort lake for vacationing New Yorkers, it is now a mostly 
suburban residential lake.

==Name==
The exact origin of the name Hopatcong is unknown, though it is most commonly attributed to the Lenape Indian word for &quot;stone water,&quot; or &quot;stone over water&quot;. Some linguists believe &quot;Hopatcong&quot; to be a derivative of the Lenape word &quot;hapakonoesson&quot;, meaning &quot;pipe stone&quot;. One explanation of the origin of the word &quot;Hopatcong&quot; is that it was a derivation from the Lenni Lenape word &quot;Huppakong&quot; meaning &quot;honey waters of many coves,&quot; but this wording was probably invented at the beginning of the 20th century to stimulate tourism.

Before the late 1700s, Lake Hopatcong was known by several names, including Great Pond and Little Pond (before flooding into a single lake), Sandhay Sea (circa 1648), Brookland Pond (mid-1700s), and Musconetcong Pond (1769).

==Lake formation==
Before the last ice age, the waters of the prehistoric Hopatcong basin fed into the Raritan River. The glacier that shaped much of the New Jersey Highlands formed a long terminal moraine that forced water from the basin into the Musconetcong River. The glacier left behind two ponds, nearly apart.

In the early 1700s, the Great Pond stretched between Henderson Bay and today&#x27;s Hopatcong State Park. Little Pond was a small body of water to the south of Woodport. The two lakes were first dammed in 1750. By 1831, Lake Hopatcong had been flooded to nearly its current shape.

==History==
===Native Americans===
The Lenape Indians discovered the area of Lake Hopatcong about 12,000 years ago. They settled near the Great Pond and Little Pond, which provided abundant fish and forested shores with ample game. The waters became important to the traditions of the matrilineal clans of Native Americans.

===Colonial development===

Colonial exploration of the Great and Little Ponds began in the 1600s. Between 1750 and 1764, a dam was built on the Musconetcong River for the Brookland Forge and mill where the river empties from the lake (now the area of Hopatcong State Park), raising the water level by about and joining the Great and Little Ponds into one. By this time, most of the local Lenape population had died of disease or left the area.

In the years that followed the American Revolution, little development occurred near Lake Hopatcong because of the mountainous terrain.

===Industrialization===

More than above sea level, Lake Hopatcong served as a natural high point and primary water supply for the Morris Canal between the Delaware River and New York Harbor. In 1831, the Morris Canal Company purchased the Brookland Forge site and replaced the dam with its own, with the intention of using the lake water to supply the Morris Canal, which would connect Phillipsburg to Newark. This new dam raised the water above the original level of Great Pond, and caused the Great Pond to connect with Little Pond and form the current Lake Hopatcong.

The flooding and subsequent formation of a single, large lake created a new geography of the area. Halsey Island and Raccoon Island, the only two true islands on Lake Hopatcong, were disconnected from the mainland. Bertrand Island and Liffy Island formed as peninsulas. Other changes included the creation of Prospect Point, the backflowing of the River Styx in Hopatcong to create an inlet, and King Cove and the south end of the lake near Landing.

In the 1850s, the Morris and Essex became the first railroad to reach Lake Hopatcong on the southern end. In the 1860s, the Ogden Mine Railroad used Nolan&#x27;s Point to transfer ore from northern New Jersey mines into canal boats. The railroad and canal systems were the chief means of transporting coal, iron, and zinc across New Jersey in the 1860s. In 1866, over of freight was transported on the canal.

===Resort destination===
In 1882, passenger rail service came to Lake Hopatcong, brought by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, which terminated at Nolan&#x27;s Point. This turned the lake into a popular summer resort.

Among the hotels built to support the growing tourism industry was the luxurious Breslin Hotel, constructed in Van Every Cove in Mount Arlington with 250 rooms and electricity. During the peak summer season, the lake was so popular that hotel rooms were difficult to come by and some visitors resorted to camping near the lake.

Various amusements sprang up around the lake. Bertrand Island Amusement Park was open for the late spring, summer, and early fall seasons. The island also hosted beauty pageants, including an unofficial 1934 Miss America. The Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club, constructed in 1910 on Bertrand Island, remains a landmark.

Lake Hopatcong hosted several strong chess tournaments in the 1920s, including the Ninth American Chess Congress in 1923, which was won by Frank Marshall and Abraham Kupchik, and another tournament in 1926, which was won by world champion José Raúl Capablanca.

Lake Hopatcong flourished in the 1920s, and many famous people owned property on the lake, including Vaudeville&#x27;s Joe Cook, who owned Sleepless Hollow in Davis Cove; Vaudeville&#x27;s Owen McGiveney (father to Maura McGiveney), who owned a house in the River Styx section for more than 30 years; actress Lotta Crabtree, who owned the Attol Tryst home in Mount Arlington; and inventor and chemist Hudson Maxim. Their presence attracted many famous visitors, including Babe Ruth, Bud Abbott, Bert Lahr,Lou Costello, and Milton Berle.

===Conversion to residential lake===
Tourism and other business endeavors near the lake, hit hard by the Great Depression, waned in the 1930s and 1940s. Permanent residences were constructed in the area, including small bungalows, in the 1940s and &#x27;50s. Much of the modern residential development surrounding the lake was completed in the 1960s and &#x27;70s.

===21st century===

====2000 flood====
More than of rain fell in a small area of southeastern Sussex and northwestern Morris County in northwestern New Jersey during August 11–14, 2000. Doppler radar estimates of total rainfall for the 4-day period reached about along the border between Sussex and Morris Counties. A severe thunderstorm on August 12 dropped so much rain in six hours that it was judged a 1,000-year event.

Peak flows at the USGS gauges on Lake Hopatcong (01455400) and Musconetcong River (01455500), among others, were the highest ever recorded. These gauges are at sites that drain areas that received 10 or more inches of rain during August 11–14. Peak flows on Lake Hopatcong and on the Musconetcong River just downstream from the lake exceeded those of a 100-year flood.

Lake Hopatcong sustained flooding damage, particularly the Great Cove area at Nolan&#x27;s Point.

====2008-09 drawdown====
Every five years, starting the day after Labor Day, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection’s (DEP) water-level management plan allows the lake to be lowered to inspect the dam structure, repair lakeshore structures, control aquatic vegetation, and remove silt and drainage material from areas around the lake.

From December 2008 to January 2009, the DEP left the dam open almost three weeks too long, which caused the water to drop almost a foot (0.3 m) below the normal drawdown level. A group of residents and business owners sued the DEP and the State of New Jersey, claiming that the DEP, against policy, released an extra . As of 2009 the case was being appealed in local court. 

On May 11, 2009, the American Power Boat Association (APBA) and the Lake Hopatcong Racing Association (LHRA) postponed their annual races due to the low water level. However, with the large amount of rainfall that June, the lake returned to its proper level above the normal average depth.

In July 2014, there were reports of a boa constrictor in the lake, but officials by August mostly figured it was a myth or a hoax. According to one report, the reports caused a 10% drop in tourism to the lake during the summer of 2014.

==Today==
Lake Hopatcong is now mostly a residential lake whose few public access points include Hopatcong State Park and Lee&#x27;s County Park Marina. Most of the shoreline is privately owned by individual lakefront residents, homeowner or community associations, or private businesses (e.g., restaurants and marinas).

Lake Hopatcong, unlike most lakes in New Jersey (other than Greenwood Lake on the New York border and Lake Lackawanna in Byram), has bars and restaurants that are accessible directly by boat. Popular tourist attractions on the lake include the Hopatcong State Park, the Lake Hopatcong Historical Museum, and the Lake Hopatcong Yacht Club.
On November 22, 2005, the EPA gave the Lake Hopatcong Commission a federal grant of $745,000 to improve the water quality and prevent phosphorus from entering the lake.

==Lake management==
Lake Hopatcong is shared by two counties (Sussex and Morris) and four boroughs and townships (Mount Arlington, Hopatcong, Jefferson Township, and Roxbury Township).

At some point in the 20th century, decisions about lake management were shaped by the state-funded Lake Hopatcong Regional Planning Board, which made recommendations to the state. Made up of representatives from each town, county, and the state, the board proved ineffective. Weeds proliferated, water quality declined, and recreation suffered.

In January 2001, Governor of New Jersey Christie Whitman signed a bill to create the Lake Hopatcong Commission, a state-funded governing body with an annual budget to maintain, upgrade and protect the lake. The commission consists of 11 members: a representative from Morris county, Sussex county, Hopatcong, Jefferson Twp, Mount Arlington, and Roxbury Twp, and five state members, including one from the Department of Environmental Protection and one from Community Affairs. The chairperson of the commission and two other public members are appointed by the governor.

But the commission has seen annual budget cuts since its inception, and has provided little more than weed harvesting services. In 2012, the state took over the weed harvesting services through Hopatcong State Park. The Lake Hopatcong Commission was not provided state funding for 2013 and now operates solely on grants. The commission administrator was laid off on December 21, 2012, and administrative responsibilities for grants are managed by Jefferson Township.

==Wildlife==

With the probable exception of the Delaware River, Lake Hopatcong is home to the greatest variety of gamefish species of any waterway in New Jersey.

Each spring, the New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife stocks the lake with rainbow trout, and in past years also stocked brook and brown trout, although they have not typically held over and survived the summers, due to an absence of cold, deep, oxygenated pockets of water in the lake. Largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, sunfish, yellow and white perch, rock bass, bluegill, crappie, chain pickerel, channel catfish, bullhead, and carp all inhabit the lake. Eels also have been caught. Hybrid striped bass, walleye, and most recently, muskellunge have been stocked within the last few decades and now are thriving. Catfish also are stocked from time to time. The main forage is the abundant alewife herring, (Clupea vernalis), the basis of the lake&#x27;s fish food chain.

<doc id="624804" wikidata="Q12486609" url="?curid=624804" title="Inner West">
<text>The Inner West of Sydney is an area directly west of the Sydney central business district, New South Wales, Australia. The suburbs that make up the Inner West are predominantly located along the southern shore of Port Jackson (Parramatta River), stretching south to the shores of the Cooks River. The western boundary of the Inner West is approximately the A3 arterial road (Homebush Bay Drive / Centenary Drive), which divides the Inner West from the Greater Western Sydney region. The Inner West is much larger than the Inner West Council local government area. The Inner West roughly corresponds with the Parish of Petersham and Parish of Concord, two cadastral divisions used for land titles.

==Suburbs==

The boundaries of the Inner West region are customary, not administrative or legal, and as such are defined differently in different contexts. The northern and southern boundaries are natural and thus generally well defined: they are the Parramatta River and the Cooks River respectively.

In the west, the upper reaches of the Cooks River flow close to, but do not meet, the Parramatta River, and the western boundary is thus ill-defined. Near the source of the Cooks River and at the point at which the two rivers run closest to each other, a large, uninhabited area stretches between the two rivers, occupied by the Enfield rail yards (now the Enfield Intermodel Logistics Centre), the Chullora rail yards, Rookwood Cemetery, Flemington Maintenance Depot, and former industrial land stretching north to the shores of Homebush Bay, which is now Sydney Olympic Park. This geographical dividing strip has long coincided with council boundaries: the former municipalities of Concord, Homebush and Strathfield lay to its east, while the former municipalities of Rookwood and Bankstown lay to its west. The creek marking the former boundary between Homebush and Rookwood is named &quot;Boundary Creek&quot;. Since the new A3 arterial road (Homebush Bay Drive / Centenary Drive) was built along this strip at the end of the 20th century, that road is now often regarded as the more precise boundary line between the Inner West and Greater Western Sydney. Today, council boundaries still largely, though not precisely, follow this line: with small exceptions, the City of Canada Bay and the Municipality of Strathfield lie to its east, while the City of Parramatta, Cumberland Council and the City of Canterbury-Bankstown lies to its west.

The eastern boundary is less well defined, as many suburbs immediately to the west of the Sydney city centre are alternatively regarded as part of the Inner West or as part of the city or &quot;inner city&quot; region. Customarily, either the A36 arterial road (Princes Highway/King Street/City Road) or the local arterial route formed by Sydney Park Road, Mitchell Road, Gibbon Street/Botany Road and Regent Street is often seen as the boundary between the Inner West and the inner city/Eastern Suburbs/inner south region.

The Inner West is alternatively defined as corresponding to the Parish of Petersham and Parish of Concord, two cadastral divisions used for land titles. This largely agrees with the customary definition above, except for some suburbs immediately to the east or west of the cadastral boundaries. For example, the western boundary of the Parish of Concord largely follows the course of Saleyards Creek, which approximates the boundary between Homebush and Flemington. The parish therefore excludes Flemington even though that suburbs lies mostly east of the A3 road. Conversely, the suburb of Rhodes is mostly west of the A3 road but in the Parish of Concord. On the eastern side, Erskineville and Macdonaldtown and Darlington are within the Parish of Petersham, but most of neighbouring Redfern and Alexandria are not.

The Australian Bureau of Statistics also defines a statistical region (Statistical Area Level 4) called &quot;Inner West&quot;. This region comprises most of the Municipality of Strathfield, Municipality of Burwood and the City of Canada Bay, as well as the former Municipality of Ashfield and Municipality of Leichhardt (both now part of Inner West Council). This region is mostly a subset of the regions in the two definitions outlined above, excluding the inner western and inner southwestern suburbs such as Glebe, Enmore, Petersham and Marrickville, which are instead in the region called &quot;City and Inner South&quot;. As it is based on suburb boundaries, it also includes some small areas that fall outside the definitions outlined above, such as the part of the suburb of Strathfield South that lies south of the Cooks River and the parts of several suburbs that lie west of the A3 road.

Another customary definition of the Inner West is by local government areas. In this customary definition, the Inner West Council, City of Canada Bay, the Municipality of Strathfield and the Municipality of Burwood make up the Inner West. This definition is sometimes used in local government administrative contexts. This definition excludes the innermost suburbs that are within the City of Sydney council area and southern suburbs that are within the City of Canterbury-Bankstown, but includes some suburbs that lie outside the above definitions but are within the Municipality of Strathfield.

Commercial sources, especially in the real estate context, sometimes refer to suburbs that are not in any of the definitions above as being in the Inner West. For example, Beaconsfield is variously considered part of inner city, Eastern Suburbs or inner south Sydney, but is also sometimes referred as part of the Inner West. Likewise, Wentworth Point is part of Greater Western Sydney by any of the above definitions, separated from the Inner West by Sydney Olympic Park and the waters of Homebush Bay, and is normally considered part of that region in administrative contexts, but is sometimes referred to as part of the Inner West.

The contested meaning of the term &quot;Inner West&quot; is itself considered a cultural phenomenon in Sydney: in reference to this, Michael Koziol, the Sydney editor of the Sydney Morning Herald, has written humorously that &quot;the inner west is a state of mind&quot;.

Based on the above definitions and the former distribution area of the &quot;Inner West Courier&quot; local newspaper, the Inner West generally includes the suburbs:
* Abbotsford
* Annandale
* Ashbury
* Ashfield
* Balmain
* Balmain East
* Birchgrove
* Breakfast Point
* Burwood

* Burwood Heights
* Cabarita
* Camperdown
* Canada Bay
* Chiswick
* Concord
* Concord West
* Croydon
* Croydon Park

* Drummoyne
* Dulwich Hill
* Enfield
* Enmore
* Erskineville
* Five Dock
* Flemington
* Forest Lodge
* Glebe

* Haberfield
* Homebush
* Hurlstone Park
* Leichhardt
* Lewisham
* Liberty Grove
* Lilyfield
* Marrickville
* Mortlake

* Newington
* Newtown
* North Strathfield
* Petersham
* Rhodes
* Rodd Point
* Rozelle
* Russell Lea
* St Peters

* Stanmore
* Strathfield
* Strathfield South
* Summer Hill
* Sydenham
* Tempe
* Wareemba
Other suburbs sometimes referred to as being in the Inner West, especially in commercial contexts, include:
* Alexandria
* Beaconsfield
* Belfield
* Campsie
* Canterbury
* Earlwood
* Wentworth Point

== History ==

===Indigenous land===
Prior to the arrival of the First Fleet, the Sydney region was home to the Darug people. This nation was broken up into a number of Aboriginal clans who tended to live in a certain geographic area. Each clan contained about 50 to 100 people and, to avoid genetic problems, the men would marry women from other clans. So the clans were interrelated and members from one clan would frequently travel in the territory of others, including to hunt, trade and perform ceremonies. They didn&#x27;t consider themselves owners of the land, rather custodians.

What is now the Inner West was formerly home to two clans, the Cadigal, whose land stretched along Port Jackson from South Head to Lewisham, and the Wangal, whose land was immediately to the west of the Cadigals and stretched to about Homebush Bay. Other clans that would have been regular visitors to the area would have included the Birrabirragal and Muru-ora-dial in what is now the Eastern Suburbs, the Bediagal and Kameygal from the Cooks River area to the south, the Burramattagal from the Parramatta area to the west, and the Wallumattagal, Cammeraigal and Gorualgal from the northern shores of the Parramatta River.

===European arrival===

Land grants in the Inner West area began in the late 18th century. By 1814, a stage coach was running between the two major settlements of Sydney (to the east) and Parramatta (to the west), then further west to Richmond. This spurred the development of several settlements along the stage coach route, now Parramatta Road. A number of the large land grants in the area were subdivided for commercial and residential development, such as Ashfield Park in 1838. The construction of the Main Suburban railway line in 1855 spurred further development, especially at the original stations of Newtown, Ashfield, Burwood and Homebush. Many of the original land grants in the area were subdivided for commercial and residential development in the decades following the arrival of the railway, such as the Village of Homebush in 1878. The colony&#x27;s elite - politicians, judges, industrialists and businessmen - began to build grand homes in the &quot;outer&quot; parts of the Inner West, such as the Arnott family (of the biscuit empire) and the family of David Jones (the retailer), who built various homes in Strathfield.

As a result of population growth, local governments formed in the area in the 19th century, such as the Municipality of Newtown in 1862, the Municipality of Petersham, the Municipality of Leichhardt and the Municipality of Ashfield in 1871, the Municipality of Burwood in 1874, the Municipality of Concord in 1883 and the Municipality of Strathfield in 1885.

During the last quarter of the 19th century, Sydney&#x27;s tram network expanded into the Inner West, and continued expanding into the early 20th century, eventually serving almost all of the Inner West, as far afield as Cabarita, Enfield and Canterbury.

In 1895, a suburban railway line was built, branching from the Illawarra railway line at Sydenham, which provided access to the railway for suburbs in the south of the Inner West, such as Marrickville and Dulwich Hill.

===Industrial and residential development===
Due to its central location and easy access by water, rail and road, large scale industrial development occurred in the Inner West in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A number of large residences were turned to industrial use, such as Arthur Renwick&#x27;s Abbotsford House, which became Nestlé&#x27;s chocolate factory, and Roland Ducker&#x27;s Strathroy in Cabarita, which became the paint factory of British Australian Lead Manufacturers (BALM), later Dulux.

However, the residential suburbs continued to be popular. For example, Australian prime ministers who lived in the Inner West in this period include William McMahon, Earle Page, George Reid, Frank Forde and Billy Hughes. A number of the high quality residential developments in the period immediately after the Federation of Australia are highly regarded ensembles of Australian residential architecture and heritage protected, including the large scale Haberfield &quot;garden suburb&quot; development, which began in 1901, the smaller Malvern Hill Estate in Croydon, which began in 1909, and the Hoskins Estate in Appian Way, Burwood, which began in 1903.

Suburbanisation accelerated in the interwar years, resulting in the outer suburbs of the Inner West, such as Strathfield, Burwood and Concord, growing in prestige while the dense inner suburbs, such as Newtown, Enmore and Erskineville, declined.

===Post-war migration and gentrification===

An influx of migrants to Australia following the end of World War II brought a large number of migrants to the Inner West, primarily from European countries. Many migrants were attracted to the area by the availability of industrial jobs, proximity to the city and the good availability of public transport. The change in demographics also brought ethnically distinct shops, cafes and restaurants, giving a cosmopolitan character to the commercial areas of a number of commercial centres in the Inner West. For example, Haberfield and Leichhardt became distinguished by the concentration of Italian businesses, while Petersham became the hub of Sydney&#x27;s Portuguese community.

Continued industrial development and the influx of blue collar workers, including European immigrants, accelerated the disparity between suburbs. In 1977, Strathfield was the most expensive suburb in metropolitan Sydney measured by median house price, while inner suburbs of the Inner West, such as Leichhardt, were cheaper than outer Western suburbs such as Bankstown.

The pattern of immigrant settlement continued and radiated further west after the end of the White Australia Policy changed the ethnic makeup of Australia&#x27;s migrant intake. For example, in the late 20th century, Ashfield became a hub for Chinese immigrants, especially those from Shanghai, known as &quot;Little Shanghai&quot;. Burwood has likewise become a hub for Chinese immigrants and overseas students.

Towards the end of the 20th century, the proliferation of alternative cultures in the inner suburbs such as Newtown led to a wave of gentrification.

Along the foreshore and in the outer suburbs of the Inner West, industrial facilities were returned to residential use. The Colgate-Palmolive factory and the Lever Brothers soap factory, both in Balmain, were converted into apartments. Both Abbotsford House and Strathroy House, mentioned above, were restored and returned to residential use, while the factories that were built around them were replaced by upmarket housing developments. Likewise, the flour mills which have long dominated the skyline of Summer Hill was redeveloped for residential use.

Reflecting these changes, by 2017, the spread of highly valued residential suburbs of the Inner West had expanded further east. In that year, the seven suburbs that recorded median house prices exceeding $2 million were, in descending order of median price: Cabarita, Strathfield, Burwood, Chiswick, Balmain East, Rhodes and Burwood Heights, covering both the traditionally popular &#x27;outer&#x27; Inner West and the newly gentrified, formerly industrial waterfront suburbs.

==Geography==

The geography of the Inner West is defined by the southern catchments of the Parramatta River, the northern boundary of the region, and the northern catchment of the Cooks River, the southern boundary. The western boundary of the region is near the source of the Cooks River. The Hume Highway approximately follows the ridgeline between the two catchments.

In this region, Parramatta River widens via a series of bays and transitions into the drowned valley that forms Sydney Harbour. This forms a series of large bays along the southern shore, the largest of these being (from west to east) Homebush Bay, Hen and Chicken Bay and Iron Cove. The presence of these bays have had a significant effect on patterns of development in the region and the placement of infrastructure such as roads and railways.

In between the two rivers, the topography is characterised by rolling hills intersected by shallow valleys through which waterways flow to the two rivers, including Iron Cove Creek, Hawthorne Canal (formerly Long Cove Creek), Whites Creek and Johnstons Creek. These waterways have been drastically altered since the late 19th century by the means of concrete lining. In the 1860s iron Cove Creek was a freely flowing waterway which in places broadened into ponds that made excellent and picturesque swimming holes. It is now barely a trickle lined by residential areas, parkland and fast-food restaurants.

==Demographics==

The &quot;Sydney - Inner West&quot; statistical area defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics covers most of the Inner West by most customary definitions, but not all of it: suburbs in the eastern and southeastern edge of the customary region which are in the City of Sydney and the former Marrickville Council areas, such as Glebe, Enmore, Petersham and Marrickville, are instead in the region called &quot;City and Inner South&quot;.

According to the , the Sydney - Inner West statistical area had a total population of 304,771 people. The most common reported ancestries were English 20.7%, Australian 17.8%, Chinese 16.5%, Italian 9.5% and Irish 9.2%, with 57.1% of people having both parents born overseas. 52.8% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were mainland China 7.9%, India 3.4%, Nepal 3.0%, England 2.8% and Italy 2.4%. 54.1% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Mandarin 8.6%, Cantonese 4.1%, Italian 3.7%, Nepali 2.9% and Korean 2.5%. The median weekly household income was $2,250, which is higher than the New South Wales median of $1,829 and the Australian median of $1,746.

The table below summarises historical data for the &quot;Sydney - Inner West&quot; statistical area since it was first defined in the 2011 census. Prior to 2011, the &quot;Inner Western Sydney&quot; statistical area covered most of the Inner West, but excluded the former Leichhardt Council, so the data is not directly comparable.

==Housing==
The housing stock within the Inner West reflects the distinct waves of development in its history. The inner-most suburbs of the Inner West were developed early in the life of the colony, and preserve stone houses from the Victorian era and earlier. The inner suburbs of the Inner West were largely subdivided in the 19th century for suburban development, and a large number of two-storey terraced houses and one-storey terraced and timber cottages survive in suburbs such as Glebe, Newtown and Annandale. Further away from the city, a large number of grand houses of the Victorian era are still standing, though many have been subdivided or are no longer in residential use. After these suburbs were subdivided around the turn of the 20th century, Federation architecture dominated the style of suburban houses, simplifying over time to the Australian Californian bungalow style which is still found throughout most of the inner west. While many of the older houses have been replaced by new constructions, a number of areas have retained contiguous areas of housing stock from the early 20th century or earlier, and a number of heritage conservation zones have been created to preserve the character of these areas.

During the 20th century, low- to medium-rise apartment blocks began to proliferate, especially along the railway line. These have in turn been succeeded by the construction of medium- to high-rise apartment blocks in the late 20th century, especially around major stations such as Strathfield and Burwood, and in the redevelopment of formerly industrial land throughout the region and especially along the Parramatta River waterfront. Nevertheless, government planning controls seek to preserve the low-density residential land use throughout much of the Inner West.

==Schools==
The Inner West is the location of several tertiary institutions such as the University of Sydney at the eastern end in Camperdown, and a major campus of the Australian Catholic University and the Catholic Institute of Sydney at the western end in Strathfield. A relatively high proportion of the population consists of tertiary students, both in the areas around these institutions, and in the suburbs further away that are well connected to educational institutions by public transport.

The Inner West has a high concentration of public and private secondary schools, many of which were established in the 19th century. Government high schools located in the Inner West include the selective secondary schools Fort Street High School and Sydney Secondary College, and the public comprehensive high schools Ashfield Boys High School, Burwood Girls High School, Concord High School (Sydney), Homebush Boys High School and Strathfield Girls High School, and the specialist high school Newtown High School of the Performing Arts. Alexandria Park Community School is a government school with both a selective stream and a comprehensive stream. Private schools in the Inner West include the Presbyterian Ladies&#x27; College in Croydon, Meriden School, St. Patrick&#x27;s College and Santa Sabina College all in Strathfield, MLC School in Burwood, Trinity Grammar School in Summer Hill (preparatory school in Strathfield), Newington College in Stanmore, Rosebank College in Five Dock and The McDonald College in North Strathfield.

==Transport==

Public transport in the region includes trains, buses, ferries and light rail.

The Inner West is bisected by the Main Suburban railway line, the main trunk of the Sydney Trains network. BMT, CCN, T1, T2, T3 and T9 services operate along this railway line, though many only serve limited stops. To the east, these services provide access to and the Sydney CBD, while to the west of Strathfield they progressively branch out into Northern Sydney, Western Sydney and beyond.

The Illawarra railway line, used by Sydney Trains SCO, T4 and T8 services to the Illawarra and Southern Sydney, passes through the southeastern part of the Inner West, with stations at , and . Connecting to the Illawarra railway line at Sydenham is the Bankstown railway line, which heads westward through the southern part of the Inner West as far as before crossing the Cooks River. This section of the Bankstown railway line has been temporarily closed since September 2024 for conversion works to enable Sydney Metro M1 services to operate over it.

The Sydney Metro West rapid transit rail line is under construction. When completed, it will provide a further connection for suburbs in the north of the Inner West, to Sydney CBD in the east, and to Sydney Olympic Park and Parramatta in the west.

There are various bus routes provided largely operated by Transit Systems.

Sydney Ferries operates services in the inner harbour and Parramatta River, with a number of wharves serving suburbs in the northern part of the Inner West. The Sydney RiverCat services in particular are designed to navigate the relatively shallow waterways on the Parramatta River route, connecting the Inner West with northern Sydney across the river, Parramatta in the west, and the Sydney CBD in the east.

The Inner West Light Rail connects Central to the Inner West via Pyrmont, with stops in Glebe, Lilyfield, Leichhardt, Lewisham and , an interchange with the Bankstown railway line.

Parramatta Road is a major arterial road that runs through the middle of the Inner West, connecting it with the major centres of Sydney City in the east and Parramatta in the west. At Summer Hill, Liverpool Road (the Hume Highway) branches from Parramatta Road and proceeds in a southwesterly direction towards Melbourne. The M4 road largely runs as a motorway tunnel under the Inner West, partly parallel to Parramatta Road. The M4 tunnel has a major junction near Haberfield, with one branch joining the surface road Parramatta Road, another joining the A4 surface road towards the Sydney CBD, and a third branch continuing east as a tunnel under the northern and eastern portion of the Inner West to connect with Anzac Bridge and the M8 motorway via the Rozelle Interchange. Ongoing projects will eventually extend the tunnel further north to connect to the future Western Harbour Tunnel, and south to provide a direct connection to Sydney Airport.

Although still playing only a small part in the overall transport task, use of bicycles for transport has increased significantly in the Inner West since the 1990s. Denser populations and shorter distances mean cycling is often quicker and more convenient than driving or taking public transport. A network of bicycle paths, signed bicycle routes on local streets and other aids to safe and convenient cycling is developing. Main bicycle routes include two north–south routes: one located in the western part of the Inner West called the Cooks River cycleway or &quot;Bay to Bay&quot; cycleway, which connects Ryde to the north with the Cooks River valley and Botany Bay to the southeast, and another located further east called the Greenway which connects Iron Cove in the north to the Cooks River valley where it joins the Cooks River cycleway, an east–west route from Five Dock to the Anzac Bridge cycleway, a northwest route from Gladesville Bridge to Anzac Bridge, and a southwest route from Marrickville to the city via Newtown. Groups of local bicycle user groups (BUGs) provide help for new cyclists, under the parent banner of Bicycle New South Wales.

==Government==
In the state parliament, the region is represented by the electoral districts of Balmain, Canterbury, Drummoyne, Newtown, Strathfield and Summer Hill. The split of these seats amongst the three largest parties has been relatively consistent. Since 2015, when the Australian Labor Party regained Strathfield from the Liberal Party of Australia, and Summer Hill and Newtown were contested for the first time, the split has remained the same, with Drummoyne represented by the Liberal Party, Canterbury, Strathfield and Summer Hill represented by the Australian Labor Party, and Balmain and Newtown represented by The Greens.

In the federal parliament, the area is represented by the electorate of Grayndler and part of the electorates of Reid (which also covers a small part of Greater Western Sydney), Sydney (which also covers the city centre) and Watson (which also encompasses a substantial section of the Canterbury-Bankstown area). All four federal seats have been held by the Australian Labor Party since the 2022 federal election, when the Labor Party won the division of Reid from the Liberal Party which had held it since 2013.

===Local Government areas===
The four local government areas of the Municipality of Burwood, City of Canada Bay, Inner West Council and Municipality of Strathfield are sometimes referred to in local government contexts as the &quot;Inner West local government areas&quot;.

Prior to the amalgamation of Marrickville, Leichardt and Ashfield Councils into Inner West Council, Marrickville Council was often excluded from official definitions of the &quot;Inner West&quot; region. As a result, a number of government sources that use definitions of the &quot;Inner West&quot; based on the earlier council boundaries include the councils listed above, but exclude the Marrickville Council area. These include the definition used by the Australian Government Bureau of Statistics, and the New South Wales Government Department of Planning and Infrastructure, and local media.

The northeastern part of the City of Canterbury-Bankstown and the western part of the City of Sydney are also often included in the Inner West region.

===Health services===

The Sydney Local Health District of NSW Health serves the Inner West, covering Burwood, Canada Bay, Inner West and Strathfield councils, the western part of the City of Sydney, as well as the former City of Canterbury part of Canterbury-Bankstown. The public hospitals within the Sydney Local Health District are:
* Balmain Hospital
* Canterbury Hospital
* Concord Repatriation General Hospital
* Royal Prince Alfred Hospital
* Sydney Dental Hospital
The Sydney Local Health District also administers the Yaralla Estate and Rivendell (former Thomas Walker Hospital).

==Sport==
The Inner West is represented in the National Rugby League by the Wests Tigers, a merger of the Balmain and Western Suburbs clubs. Some residents in the region also subscribe their loyalty to the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. In the tier below known as the New South Wales Cup, the area is represented by the Newtown Jets and Wests Magpies.

In rugby union, the area is represented by Sydney Uni (the University of Sydney) and West Harbour in the Sydney grade competition.

In soccer football, Leichhardt Oval is the home of the A-league team Sydney FC. The Inner West also has many semi-professional soccer teams playing in the various divisions of the NSW State Leagues. The most high-profile club is NSW Premier League side APIA Leichhardt Tigers.

==Religion==
In the 2021 Census, the most common responses for religion in the Sydney - Inner West statistical area (which, as noted above, covers most but not all of the Inner West by most customary definitions) were No Religion, 37.2%, Catholic 25.8%, Hinduism 6.5%, Anglican 5.7% and Not stated 5.6%.

The Inner West contains a large number of religions buildings and institutions. For example, concentrated in the Strathfield-Homebush area are the Catholic institutions the Australian Catholic University, the Catholic Institute of Sydney and the Seminary of the Good Shepherd. Strathfield is also home to the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul of the Russian Orthodox Church as well as the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Virgin of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church.

The heritage-listed Chinese temples Sze Yup Temple is located in Glebe. Beit Maroun, the residence of the archbishop of the Maronite Church in Australia, is located in Strathfield, while St Maroun&#x27;s College is located in Dulwich Hill.

<doc id="624809" wikidata="Q5044797" url="?curid=624809" title="Carolina Cobras">
<text>The Carolina Cobras were an expansion franchise in the Arena Football League. The team was formed prior to the 2000 season, which endured a player strike.

The team was originally based in Raleigh, North Carolina, but moved to Charlotte following its third season.

==History==
They played their home games in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the Raleigh Entertainment &amp; Sports Arena (now called the Lenovo Center) prior to the 2003 season. The team was based in the Charlotte Coliseum through 2004. Coaching staff included: Ed Khayat, John Gregory, Ron Selesky, Ray Jauch. On September 20, 2004, prior to the arrival of the NBA&#x27;s Charlotte Bobcats, the league announced the termination of this franchise; its players were made available to the other AFL teams in a dispersal draft.

==Legacy==
The Cobras&#x27; legacy in Charlotte was actually meant to fill open dates at the Charlotte Coliseum when the original Charlotte Hornets moved to New Orleans. When the Charlotte Bobcats began play, the Cobras were no longer necessary.

The Cobras&#x27; name (previously used for one year by the Charlotte Cobras of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League) is now in use by the city of Charlotte for its works team in the National Public Safety Football League.

<doc id="624810" wikidata="Q3403302" url="?curid=624810" title="Uppingham School">
<text>Uppingham School is a public school (English fee-charging boarding and day school for pupils 13-18) in Uppingham, Rutland, England, founded in 1584 by Robert Johnson, the Archdeacon of Leicester, who also established Oakham School. The headmaster, Richard Maloney, belongs to the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference and the school to the Rugby Group of British independent schools. Edward Thring was the school&#x27;s best-known headmaster (in 1853–1887). His curriculum changes were adopted in other English public schools. John Wolfenden, headmaster from 1934 to 1944, chaired the Wolfenden Committee, whose report recommending the decriminalisation of homosexuality appeared in 1957. Uppingham has a musical tradition based on work by Paul David and Robert Sterndale Bennett. It has the biggest playing-field area of any school in England, in three separate areas of the town: Leicester to the west, Middle to the south, and Upper to the east.

==History==
In 1584 Uppingham School was founded with a hospital, or almshouse, by Archdeacon Robert Johnson. The original 1584 schoolroom in Uppingham churchyard is still owned by the school and is a Grade I listed building. The original hospital building is now incorporated in the School Library.

The first recorded Uppingham schoolboy was Henry Ferne from York, who was chaplain to Charles I. Another prominent early schoolboy was the Jesuit Anthony Turner, one of the martyrs of the Popish Plot.

In the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries Uppingham remained a small school of 30–60 pupils, with two staff. Despite its small size, pupils then regularly gained places and scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge universities. During that period, various lasting features of life in the school developed. It became a full boarding school, with all pupils having individual studies. This pattern was set around 1800 and some of the original studies survive, although no longer used as such. The first recorded school play was performed in 1794 and Uppingham has a thriving theatre. The main recreation in the 19th century was cricket – the first recorded cricket match, described in the school magazine, was in 1815 – and the game still thrives there. In 1846 the institution of school praepostors, or prefects, was established. The praepostors are called &quot;pollies&quot; around the school. One of the earliest Old Boys to gain fame was Thomas Bonney, a pupil in the 1850s, who became the most distinguished geologist of his time, and president of the Alpine Club. Until at least 1853, the school was known as &quot;Uppingham Grammar School.&quot;

Edward Thring transformed the school from a small, local grammar school into a large, well-known public school, with 330 pupils. During his headship on 4 April 1876 the entire school, consisting of 300 boys, thirty masters, and their families, moved temporarily to Borth in Wales after an outbreak of typhoid ravaged the town as a result of the poorly maintained water system. In Borth the school took over the disused Cambrian Hotel and a number of boarding houses, remaining there for fourteen months. The move was successful in saving the school from a serious epidemic and the move to Borth is commemorated in an annual service held in the school chapel.

Thring also won national and transatlantic reputation as an original thinker and writer on education. At a time when mathematics and classics dominated the curriculum, he encouraged many ‘extra&#x27; subjects: French, German, science, history, art, carpentry, and music. In particular, Thring was a pioneer in his introduction of music into the regular system of education. He opened the first gymnasium in an English school, the forerunner of the present sports hall, and later added a heated indoor swimming pool. He commissioned a number of buildings, notably the chapel designed by the Gothic Revival architect G. E. Street.

Ernest William Hornung was at the school in the 1880s; he wrote several novels but his fame rests upon his creation of the character A. J. Raffles.

During this period the school continued to grow, with numbers reaching well over 400. These years saw the formation in 1889 of the Combined Cadet Force; the creation in 1890 of the first school orchestra; in 1896 the re-introduction of hockey; and the adoption of rugby football, with the first match being against Rugby. Uppingham pupils still take part in all these activities today.
The buildings of the school continued to grow with the construction of the tower block, through which one still enters the school, and the combined gymnasium and concert hall, which in 1972 was converted into the school theatre.

Throughout the Second World War the buildings of Kingswood School in Bath were used by the Admiralty for strategic planning. During that time Kingswood School lodged with Uppingham School sharing Uppingham&#x27;s resources.

Pupils have continued to go on to later fame – Patrick Abercrombie, pioneer town planner; Sir Malcolm Campbell, motor racer; James Elroy Flecker, poet and playwright: C. R. W. Nevinson, official war artist in both world wars; W. H. Pratt (Boris Karloff), film actor; E. J. Moeran, composer; Lt General Sir Brian Horrocks, Commander of the XXX Corps under Montgomery, and later a TV lecturer on battles and war; and Percy Chapman, captain of the England cricket team 1926–30, who won the Ashes.

The growth of the school continued with numbers of well over 600 pupils being reached in the 1960s. In 1973 the first girl attended Uppingham, as a day-girl; with a few more added in 1974. Then in 1975 the first sixth form girls&#x27; house, Fairfield, was opened, with its full complement of 50 girls achieved by 1976. This venture proved so successful that in 1986 a second girls&#x27; house, Johnson&#x27;s, was opened; and in 1994 the Lodge House (formerly a boys&#x27; house) was converted into the third girls&#x27; house. In 2001 the first 13-year-old girls entered the school, with the opening of a new house, Samworths&#x27;, the first house for girls aged 13–18; followed in 2002 by the conversion of Fairfield into a second house for 13–18-year-old girls and another new house, New House, opened in 2004. Johnson&#x27;s was converted to a 13–18 girls&#x27; house in 2011 with an extension and significant internal reconstruction.

The buildings of the school continued to expand. The First World War took the lives of 450 former pupils and the school hall was built in their memory. Uppingham had been attended by Edward Brittain, Roland Leighton and Victor Richardson who were immortalised in Vera Brittain&#x27;s memoir &quot;Testament of Youth&quot;. Also built in this period were the main classroom block in the centre of the school, the cricket and rugby pavilions, and a school sanatorium. In 1956 a new science block was opened by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh; it was extended in the 1960s. In 1989 a new maths block for mathematics and computing was opened by Stephen Hawking. New squash courts were built and in 1970 the sports centre, incorporating the old swimming pool, was opened, with the later addition of a climbing wall and a weights room. In 1981 came a new music school and a new buttery, where the pupils can buy snacks. In 1995 a new arts and design faculty was built, the Leonardo Centre, designed by an old pupil, Piers Gough. In 2003 a language centre (TLC) opened to house all the modern-language classrooms. In 2006 a third music facility, the Paul David Music School (PDMS), opened in School Lane, incorporating the old houses that were there, to accommodate the growing demand for music at the school. In 2010 the Uppingham School Sports Centre (USSC) was completed, and the old sports centre demolished to create space to develop the new science centre, all part of the new &quot;Western Quad&quot;.

In the post-war period, sports other than the main ones of rugby, hockey, cricket, athletics, swimming and shooting began to be introduced including tennis, basketball, badminton, fencing, squash, sailing, soccer and golf.

In 1945 Douglas Guest succeeded Robert Sterndale Bennett as Director of Music and this area of school life developed further. The concert choir was expanded to involve over half the school: a bandmaster was appointed; music scholarships were introduced; and various music societies were created. All these innovations remain. Recently the school&#x27;s music facilities have been improved again. The school houses two large three-manual pipe organs, in the memorial hall and the chapel, the latter one being rebuilt in the summer of 2007 by Nicholson Organs of Malvern. A new choir division appears high on the south wall, and a new console and action have been installed, along with new pipework. The organ is notable for a smooth Harrison tone and a rare pair of independent sets of Swell shutters – one opening west into the nave extension and one south across the repositioned choir stalls.

In the 1960s Uppingham pioneered the introduction of design and technology into the curriculum, with Uppingham being the first independent school, and one of the first five schools in Britain, to evolve and introduce A-level design. Design was taught in the Thring Centre, opened in 1965. These subjects were then transferred with art, woodwork and metalwork to the Leonardo Centre, opened in 1995.

The years since the 1970s have seen a considerable expansion in the subjects taught, particularly at A-level, with the introduction of politics, ancient history, design, business studies, theatre studies, classical civilisation, Spanish, Italian, philosophy &amp; religious studies, ICT and physical education.

Uppingham has one of the largest private theatres in the country, in a building based on the original Leipzig Gewandhaus. An extension to the main theatre houses a drama studio to be used for the teaching of theatre studies as well as for performances of smaller productions. There is also a large workshop to provide storage and workspace for technical equipment.

===Recent developments===
In 2005 the school was one of fifty of the country&#x27;s leading independent schools which were fined for exchanging information on planned fee increases, exposed by &quot;The Times&quot;. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared. However, Jean Scott, the head of the Independent Schools Council, said that independent schools had always been exempt from anti-cartel rules applied to business, were following a long-established procedure in sharing the information with each other, and that they were unaware of the change to the law (on which they had not been consulted). She wrote to John Vickers, the OFT director-general, saying, &quot;They are not a group of businessmen meeting behind closed doors to fix the price of their products to the disadvantage of the consumer. They are schools that have quite openly continued to follow a long-established practice because they were unaware that the law had changed.&quot;

In May 2010, a pupil rebellion was staged over the expulsion of several sixth-form pupils. For a day, 500 pupils failed to attend classes and formed protests in aid of the dismissed pupils.

In March 2011, twice Olympic gold medallist Sebastian Coe officially opened the school&#x27;s new sports centre. The building includes a large sports hall, 25m swimming pool, a 50-station fitness studio, squash courts, gymnasium and two dance studios. It was designed by ORMS Architecture Design and is part of the school&#x27;s plans to develop the western campus buildings. The school now has, in a converted squash court behind the theatre, a climbing wall facility, installed in 2010.

In November 2014, Sir Alec Jeffreys officially opened the school&#x27;s new science centre which, along with an extension to the Leonardo Centre, completed the new &#x27;Western Quad&#x27;.

In 2018, the cricket pavilion was listed as Grade II by Historic England.

==Academic results==
In 2019, 45% of pupils scored A*-A for their A-Levels examination, whereas 70% scored A*-A for their GCSEs.

In 2023, 69 percent of students achieved grades 9-7 in their GCSE exams, while 51 percent attained A* or A grades in their A-level exams.

==Houses==
There are nine boys&#x27; boarding houses at Uppingham, informally split into three groups:
*The &#x27;Hill Houses&#x27; are Brooklands, Fircroft and Highfield (1863);
*The &#x27;Town Houses&#x27; are School House, Lorne House, West Deyne (1859) and West Bank (1866);
*The &#x27;Country Houses&#x27; are Meadhurst and Farleigh.

There are six girls&#x27; boarding houses: Johnson&#x27;s, The Lodge (sixth form only), Fairfield, New House, Constables and Samworths&#x27;. Samworths&#x27; was built in 2001 as the first house for girls aged 13 to 18; it was named after the Samworth Brothers, Old Uppinghamians, who helped to finance the construction.

There is one day house at Uppingham introduced in September 2024. The Li House is based in what used to be the Thring Centre and is named after Dr the Hon Sir David Lee Kwok Po, a pioneering OU who was the first Uppinghamian from Hong Kong in 1954.

==Southern Railway Schools Class==
The 24th steam locomotive (Engine 923) in the Southern Railway&#x27;s class V (of which there were 40) was originally named &quot;Uppingham&quot;, but the name was changed after objections from the school.

This class was also known as the Schools Class because all 40 of the class were named after prominent English public schools. &#x27;Uppingham&#x27;, as it was called, was built in December 1933 and had its name changed to Bradfield on 14 August 1934.

<doc id="624811" wikidata="Q1312413" url="?curid=624811" title="Quintinshill rail disaster">
<text>The Quintinshill rail disaster was a multi-train rail crash which occurred on 22 May 1915 outside the Quintinshill signal box near Gretna Green in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. It resulted in the deaths of over 200 people and remains the worst rail disaster in British history.

The Quintinshill signal box controlled two passing loops, one on each side of the double-track Caledonian Main Line linking Glasgow and Carlisle (part of the West Coast Main Line). At the time of the accident, both passing loops were occupied with goods trains, and a northbound local passenger train was standing on the southbound main line.

The first collision occurred when a southbound troop train travelling from to Liverpool collided with the stationary local train. A minute later the wreckage was struck by a northbound sleeping car express train travelling from London Euston to Glasgow Central. Gas from the Pintsch gas lighting system of the old wooden carriages of the troop train ignited, starting a fire which soon engulfed all five trains.

Only half the soldiers on the troop train survived. Those killed were mainly Territorial soldiers from the 1/7th (Leith) Battalion, the Royal Scots heading for Gallipoli. The precise death toll was never established with confidence as some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and the roll list of the regiment was also destroyed in the fire. The official death toll was 227 (215 soldiers, nine other passengers and three railway employees), but the Army later reduced their 215 figure by one. Not counted in the 227 were four victims thought to be children, but whose remains were never claimed or identified. The soldiers were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh&#x27;s Rosebank Cemetery, where an annual remembrance is held.

An official inquiry, completed on 17 June 1915 for the Board of Trade, found the cause of the collision to be neglect of the rules by two signalmen. With the northbound loop occupied, the northbound local train had been reversed onto the southbound line to allow passage of two late-running northbound sleepers. Its presence was then overlooked, and the southbound troop train was cleared for passage. As a result, both signalmen were charged with manslaughter in England, then convicted of culpable homicide after a trial in Scotland; the two terms are broadly equivalent. After they were released from a Scottish jail in 1916, they were re-employed by the railway company, although not as signalmen.

==Background==
The disaster occurred at Quintinshill signal box, which was an intermediate box in a remote location, sited to control two passing loops, one on each side of the double-track main line of the Caledonian Railway. On that section of the main line between Carlisle and Glasgow, in British railway parlance, Up is towards Carlisle and Down is towards Glasgow. The area around the signal box was thinly-populated countryside with scattered farms.

The Ordnance Survey 1:2500 map of 1859 (but not modern maps) shows a house named Quintinshill at approximately 55.0133°N 3.0591°W, around south-south-east of the signal box. The nearest settlement was Gretna, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) to the south of the box, on the Scottish side of the Anglo-Scottish border.

Responsibility for Quintinshill signal box rested with the stationmaster at Gretna railway station who, on the day of the accident, was Alexander Thorburn. The box was staffed by one signalman, on a shift system. In the mornings, a night-shift signaller would be relieved by the early-shift signaller at 6.00 am. On the day of the disaster, George Meakin was the night signalman, while James Tinsley was to work the early day shift.

At the time of the accident, normal northbound traffic through the section included two overnight sleeping car expresses, from London to Glasgow and Edinburgh, respectively, which were due to depart Carlisle at 5.50 am and 6.05 am. They were followed by an all-stations local passenger service from Carlisle to , which was advertised in the public timetable as departing Carlisle at 6.10 am but which normally departed at 6.17 am. If the sleepers ran late, the local service could not be held back to depart from Carlisle after them because precedence would then need to be given to the scheduled departure of rival companies&#x27; express trains at 6.30 am and 6.35 am. Also, any late running of the local train would cause knock-on delays to a Moffat to Glasgow and Edinburgh commuter service, with which the stopper connected at Beattock. Therefore, in the event of one or both of the sleepers running late, the stopping train would depart at its advertised time of 6.10 am, and then be shunted at one of the intermediate stations or signal boxes to allow the sleeper(s) to overtake it.

One of the locations where that could take place was Quintinshill, where there were passing loops for both Up and Down lines. If the Down (northbound) loop was occupied, as it was on the morning of the accident, then the northbound local train would be shunted, via a trailing crossover, to the Up (southbound) main line. Although not a preferred method of operation, it was allowed by the rules and was not considered a dangerous manoeuvre, provided the proper precautions were taken. In the six months before the accident, the 6.17 am local train had been shunted at Quintinshill 21 times, and on four of those occasions it had been shunted onto the Up line.

== Accident ==

=== Preceding train movements ===

The disaster occurred on the morning of 22 May. On this morning, both of the northbound night expresses were running late, and the northbound local train required to be shunted at Quintinshill, but the Down passing loop was occupied by the 4.50 am goods train from Carlisle. Two southbound trains were also due to pass through the box&#x27;s section of track - a special freight train consisting of empty coal wagons and a special troop train.

With the Down loop occupied, night shift signalman Meakin decided to shunt the local passenger train onto the Up main line. At this point, the southbound empty coal train was standing at the Up Home signal to the north of Quintinshill, and accordingly, it was still occupying the section from Kirkpatrick (the next signalbox to the north). This meant that signalman Meakin had not yet telegraphed Kirkpatrick the &quot;train out of section&quot; signal for the empty coal train, which in turn meant that he could not send the &quot;blocking back&quot; signal to advise the Kirkpatrick signalman that the local train was standing on the Up main line. Once the local train had crossed onto the Up main line, Meakin allowed the empty coal wagon train to proceed into the Up loop. Arriving late aboard the local train, the early day shift signalman Tinsley reached Quintinshill signal box shortly after 6.30 am. At 6.34 am one of the signalmen (it was never established which) gave the &quot;train out of section&quot; bell to Kirkpatrick for the coal train. At this point, two crucial failures in the signalling procedure occurred (see Rules breaches).

After being relieved by signalman Tinsley, the night duty signalman Meakin remained in the signal box reading the newspaper that Tinsley had brought. Both guards from the freight trains had also entered the signal box, and war news in the newspaper was discussed. Shortly afterwards, because the local train had stood on the main line for over three minutes, pursuant to Rule 55 its driver sent fireman George Hutchinson to the box, although he left at 6.46 am, having failed to fully perform the required duties (see Rules breaches).

At 6.38 am the first of the northbound expresses from Carlisle passed Quintinshill safely. At 6.42 am Kirkpatrick &quot;offered&quot; the southbound troop train to Quintinshill. Signalman Tinsley immediately accepted the troop train, and four minutes later, he was offered and accepted the second northbound express from Gretna Junction. At 6.47 am, Tinsley received the &quot;train entering section&quot; signal from Kirkpatrick for the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, having forgotten about the local passenger train (aboard which he had arrived that morning), which was occupying the Up line. The troop special was immediately accepted by Gretna Junction, so Tinsley pulled &quot;off&quot; his Up home signal to allow the troop train to run forward.

=== Collisions ===
The troop train collided head-on with the stationary local train on the up line at 6.49 am. Just over a minute later, the second northbound express train ran into the wreckage, having passed the Quintinshill Down Distant signal before it could be returned to danger. The wreckage also included the goods train in the down loop and the trucks of the empty coal train in the up loop. At 6.53 am Tinsley sent the &quot;Obstruction Danger&quot; bell signal to both Gretna and Kirkpatrick, stopping all traffic and alerting others to the disaster.

=== Fire ===

Many men on the troop train were killed as a result of the two collisions, but the disaster was made much worse by a subsequent fire. The great wartime traffic and a shortage of carriages meant that the railway company had to press into service obsolete Great Central Railway stock. These carriages had wooden bodies and frames, with very little crash resistance compared with steel-framed carriages, and were gas-lit using the Pintsch gas system.

The gas was stored in reservoirs slung under the underframe, and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs had been filled before leaving Larbert, and this, combined with the lack of available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of railway staff and the Carlisle fire brigade.

The troop train had consisted of 21 vehicles; all were consumed in the fire, apart from the rear six, which had broken away during the impact and rolled back along the line a short distance. The fire also affected four coaches from the express train and some goods wagons. Such was the intensity of the fire that all the coal in the locomotive tenders was consumed.

=== Rescue efforts ===
Amongst the first rescuers to arrive at the scene were Mr and Mrs Dunbar, caretakers at The Old Blacksmith&#x27;s Shop, Gretna Green. Mrs Dunbar stated that when she heard the crash, her immediate thought was that the Germans had come. Mrs Dunbar telephoned doctors in Carlisle for assistance. Mr Dunbar spent the day assisting with the rescue efforts.

The last known survivor of the accident, Peter Stoddart, was interviewed in Wisbech by Michael Simkins in around 1985. Simkins wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2001: &quot;I asked him about a story I had heard of an officer who went about the scene shooting men trapped in the burning wreckage. &#x27;That was true. I saw that. He was a Scottish gentleman, eventually a millionaire. But he had to.&#x27; There was a suspicion of a chuckle in his voice as he added: &#x27;And there were one or two other survivors who made themselves scarce. They took their opportunity.&#x27;&quot; Stoddart died on 4 July 1988 following a stroke.

On 16 May 2015, the BBC reported Colonel Robert Watson, a senior retired army officer who had served with the Royal Scots, saying that he believed that some soldiers were &quot;probably&quot; shot in mercy killings. The BBC said that while no official army records of the alleged shooting existed, &quot;many reports written in the press at the time of the accident suggested that some trapped soldiers, threatened with the prospect of being burnt alive in the raging inferno, took their own lives or were shot by their officers&quot;. The colonel&#x27;s remarks were recorded for a BBC Scotland documentary made to mark the centenary of the disaster, &quot;Quintinshill: Britain&#x27;s Deadliest Rail Disaster&quot;.

He told the documentary makers: &quot;All those that could be rescued were rescued. Many of them had amputations carried out underneath burning carriages so that they could be rescued. But many, of course, were trapped in such a position that they couldn&#x27;t be got out or else the fire had taken hold, and they couldn&#x27;t be got to. And, of course, since then, we&#x27;ve heard stories of some soldiers being shot and some soldiers possibly taking their own lives. It&#x27;s never been formally documented. My own personal belief is that it probably did happen, in a sense of compassion, of mercy killing. It&#x27;s almost impossible, sitting here, to comprehend what it was like that morning.&quot; The BBC said that this section of the interview with Watson would not be broadcast.

According to Earnshaw &quot;Many were trapped inside the burning train; injured men with no hope of escape begged their rescuers to shoot them whilst gunfire added an eerie effect to the scene as small arms and rifle shells in the luggage vans began to explode in the intense heat.&quot;

==Aftermath==
By 24 May, newspapers were already reporting the accident as the deadliest in the United Kingdom. The initial estimate was 158 dead, with over 200 injured. The bodies of the victims were initially laid in a field by the line and covered in white sheets. They were later taken to a nearby farm or to Gretna Green Village Hall. The Board of Trade appointed Lieutenant Colonel Edward Druitt, R.E. to head the inquiry into the accident. The King sent a telegram to Caledonian Railway general manager Donald Mathieson expressing sympathy and asking to be kept informed of the recovery of those injured.

On 23 May, a recruitment meeting was held at the Usher Hall, Edinburgh, to raise a new battalion. The railway was reopened through Quintinshill on the morning of 25 May, although not all the wreckage had been removed. The two locomotives of the express train stood in a siding with all their paint burnt off.

==Casualties==
The overwhelming majority of fatalities were among the men of the Royal Scots. The precise number was not established as the roll list of the regiment was destroyed by the fire. Lt.-Col. Druitt&#x27;s official report gives an estimated total of 215 deaths and a further 191 injured. Of the 500 soldiers of the 7th Battalion of the Royal Scots on the troop train, only 58 men were present for roll call at 4.00 pm that afternoon, along with seven officers.

In total, around 226 people died, and 246 were injured. The engine crew of the troop train also died in the first collision. Both driver Scott and fireman Hannah had driven the Royal Train.

Considering the double collision and the fire, casualties in the other trains were lighter than might have been expected. On the local train, two passengers died, with none seriously injured; on the express, seven passengers died, with a further 51 and 3 members of railway staff seriously injured.
===Funerals===

Some bodies were never recovered, having been wholly consumed by the fire, and when the bodies of the men of the Royal Scots were returned to Leith on 24 May, they were buried together in a mass grave in Edinburgh&#x27;s Rosebank Cemetery. The coffins were laid three deep, with each on the top row covered in the Union Flag.

The public were excluded from the cemetery, although 50 wounded servicemen who were convalescing at a nearby military hospital were allowed to attend. The ceremony lasted three hours, at the end of which a volley of three shots was fired, and the Last Post was sounded.

The bodies were escorted by the 15th and 16th Battalions of Royal Scots, the Edinburgh Pals battalions recently assembled and still undergoing training. The cortege took four hours to complete its task. A memorial to the dead troops was erected in Rosebank Cemetery in 1916.

Of the troops, 83 bodies were identified, 82 were recovered but unrecognisable, and 50 were missing altogether, giving the total of 215, later revised by the army to 214. The soldiers were buried with full military honours.

Among the coffins were four bodies which were unidentified and appeared to be remains of children. One coffin was simply labelled as &#x27;little girl, unrecognisable,&#x27; and another as &#x27;three trunks, probably children&#x27;. As no children were reported missing, the railway company moved the bodies to Glasgow for possible identification, but no one came forward to claim the bodies; which were buried in Glasgow&#x27;s Western Necropolis on 26 May. The engine crew of the troop train were both from Carlisle, and they were also buried on 26 May at Stanwix Cemetery.

===Survivors===
The surviving officers and men of the Royal Scots were taken to Carlisle on the evening of 22 May. The next morning, they went on by train to Liverpool, but on arrival there, they were medically examined: all the enlisted men and one officer were declared unfit for service overseas and were returned to Edinburgh. Only Lieutenant Colonel W. Carmichael Peebles and five other officers were fit enough to sail from Liverpool for overseas service. It was reported in the &quot;Edinburgh Weekly&quot; that on their march from the port to the railway station, the survivors were mistaken for prisoners of war and pelted by some children.

==Locomotives==
There were four steam locomotives hauling the three passenger trains directly involved in the collisions, the express train having been double headed. All were designs built for the Caledonian Railway. The two locomotives that collided head-on in the first impact (when the troop train hit the local train) were both written off and scrapped. The local train&#x27;s locomotive had been No. 907 of the &quot;903&quot; Class (4-6-0 wheel arrangement). The troop train&#x27;s locomotive was No. 121 of the 113 Class (4-4-0). The two locomotives of the express train which hit the wreckage a minute later, were subsequently repaired and returned to traffic - No. 140 of the &quot;Dunalastair IV&quot; Class and No. 48 of the 43 Class (both 4-4-0).

==Investigations==

=== Breaches of regulations ===
The sequence of events leading up to the collisions featured multiple breaches of the railway&#x27;s regulations, which formed the basis of the later prosecution of both signallers. In total, eight separate rule breaches by the signalmen were identified.

==== Shift change irregularity ====
For the 6.00 am shift change, the signalmen had developed an informal arrangement allowing whoever was working the early day shift to arrive for work at around 6.30 am. This allowed the day shift signalman to get up slightly later, and in the case of Signalman Tinsley (who lived in Gretna) it enabled him to travel to work on the local train on days when it was to be shunted at Quintinshill. The signalmen at Gretna Junction would let Tinsley know when this was to occur.

To avoid this malpractice being detected by company management, whichever signalman was working the night shift would record all train register entries after 6.00 am on a piece of paper rather than in the register book itself. When the day shift man arrived, he would copy the entries from the paper into the train register in his own handwriting, making it appear that the shift change had occurred at the correct time. The changing of shifts was a safety-critical moment where it was essential that the signalman taking over the box was fully aware of the position of trains and for all block signalling requirements to be properly completed and recorded. The need for Tinsley to copy out the missing train register entries as soon as he took over the signal box may have distracted him from his duties in relation to the handover of the box and seems likely to have been a factor in his subsequent acceptance of the troop train.

==== Block signalling omissions ====
Immediately after the empty coal train had stopped in the Up loop, two crucial failures in block signalling procedure occurred.

Firstly, as soon as the &quot;train out of section&quot; bell code had been telegraphed to Kirkpatrick signal box to advise that the empty wagon train was out of the section and clear of the Up main line at Quintinshill, the Quintinshill signalman should have followed this up by sending the &quot;blocking back&quot; bell code to Kirkpatrick. This would have advised the Kirkpatrick signalman that another train (i.e. the Down local) was occupying the Up main line inside the Quintinshill home signal. On receipt of the &quot;blocking back&quot; bell the Kirkpatrick signalman would not have been permitted to offer another Up train to Quintinshill until he had received the &quot;obstruction removed&quot; bell from the Quintinshill signalman to confirm that the shunted train was clear of the Up line. However, although the &quot;train out of section&quot; signal was belled to Kirkpatrick, the &quot;blocking back&quot; signal was never sent. Significantly, the &quot;train out of section&quot; signal was sent at 6.34 am immediately after Tinsley arrived in the signal box and at the moment when responsibility for working the box was being handed over. Both of the Quintinshill signalmen subsequently claimed that the other man had been the one to send the &quot;train out of section&quot; signal.

Secondly, the signalman at Quintinshill should have placed a signal lever collar over the relevant signal lever, which would have served as a physical reminder not to clear his signals for the Up line. Neither man did so, and Signalman Tinsley failed to check for the presence of a lever collar when he took over the working of the box. Meakin and Tinsley admitted in the Coroner&#x27;s inquest that they did not regularly use the lever collars and this was confirmed by Hutchinson.

==== Incomplete performance of Rule 55 ====
Another important precaution designed specifically to prevent such signalling errors also failed to be implemented on that day - Rule 55. Under this rule, if any train was stopped on the main line for longer than three minutes, the driver was required to send one of the crew to the signal box in order to remind the signalman of the presence of the train and to ensure that the necessary safeguards to protect the train (e.g. lever collars on the signal levers) were in place. The crewman was required to sign the train register to confirm that he had visited the signal box and carried out these actions.

Since the local train had been stopped for longer than three minutes, its fireman, George Hutchinson, was dispatched to the box. Contrary to the rule, Hutchinson merely signed the train register, using a pen that Tinsley (who was intent on filling in the missing entries in the train register) handed over his shoulder without looking up. Hutchinson then returned to his engine without reminding the signaller of his train&#x27;s position or checking that the signalman had placed a lever collar on the signal lever.

==== Unauthorised persons in signal box ====
Various railwaymen were required to visit the signal box as part of their duties, but it was expressly forbidden for such visitors to stay any longer than necessary due to the potential for the distraction of the signalman. However, signal boxes were relatively comfortable places to spend time (having a stove, kettle and the company of the signalman), so there was a temptation for such visitors to linger. When Tinsley arrived at Quintinshill signal box on the morning of the accident, the guard of the down goods train was leaving the box having been there for around ten minutes, while the guard of the up empty wagon train arrived at the same time and was still in the box when the first collision occurred 15 minutes later. Furthermore, after handing over the working of the signal box to Tinsley, Meakin remained in the box reading the newspaper. The unnecessary presence of these other railwaymen may have further distracted Tinsley from his duties.

==== Forgetfulness ====
The failure to carry out the &quot;blocking back&quot; procedure enabled the Kirkpatrick signalman to offer the up troop train to Quintinshill, but as the down local train was standing on the Up main line inside the Quintinshill home signal the block regulations prohibited Tinsley from accepting the troop train. However, despite the fact that he had travelled to work on the footplate of the local train minutes earlier and that the train was standing in clear sight directly in front of the signal box, Tinsley forgot about its presence. He, therefore, accepted the troop train and offered it forward to Gretna Junction, where it was accepted. In the absence of a lever collar on the Up Home signal lever to remind him the line was blocked, he pulled off the Up line signals to allow the troop train to run through Quintinshill.

===Board of Trade inquiry===
The first official investigation into the disaster commenced in Carlisle on 25 May at County Hall, Carlisle. It was conducted by Lieutenant Colonel Edward Druitt RE of the Railway Inspectorate on behalf of the Board of Trade. Druitt had already spent some time at the accident site and spent the day in Carlisle interviewing witnesses, including both Meakin and Tinsley. Both men were honest about their failures to abide by the rules and their generally lax behaviour. Druitt presented his report to the Board of Trade on 17 June 1915 and laid the blame squarely on Meakin and Tinsley.
This disastrous collision was thus due to want of discipline on the part of the signalmen, first by changing duty at an unauthorised hour, which caused Tinsley to be occupied in writing up the Train Register Book, and so diverted his attention from his proper work, secondly by Meakin handing over the duty in a very lax manner; and, thirdly by both signalmen neglecting to carry out various rules specially framed for preventing accidents due to forgetfulness on the part of signalmen.
Druitt was also critical of Hutchinson for his failure to comply properly with Rule 55, and also of Gretna stationmaster Alexander Thorburn, who, in Druitt&#x27;s opinion, cannot have been unaware of the irregular shift changes operated by Meakin and Tinsley.

Druitt concluded that even had all the trains been lit by electricity, a fire would still have occurred as the wagons of the goods train in the down loop caught fire. He also concluded that had Quintinshill been equipped with track circuiting, then the accident would have been avoided as the electrical interlocking of the signals would have prevented Tinsley from pulling the relevant signal levers, but that with its simple layout and good visibility from the signal box Quintinshill was a low priority for track circuits to be installed.

===Coroner&#x27;s inquest in England===
The legal position was complicated because although the accident occurred in Scotland, some of the injured subsequently died in England where the law was different. In Scotland, deaths were investigated by the procurator fiscal who, if he found culpability on the part of anyone, could order their arrest and charge them with culpable homicide. In England, the coroner investigated the death and, if the coroner&#x27;s jury found that death was due to neglect, then the coroner could indict charges of manslaughter against the named parties. The coroner for Carlisle, T S Strong, asked for guidance from the Home Office and was instructed to conduct inquests on those who had died in England in the normal way. The inquest opened on 25 May but was immediately adjourned until 23 June to allow Druitt to finish his investigation. After two days hearing evidence from, among others, Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson, Strong summed up the evidence to the nineteen-man jury. He highlighted that if Meakin and Tinsley had obeyed the rules on any of (a) blocking back, (b) lever collars, or (c) a correctly kept train register, they could not have forgotten the stationary train. He concluded his summing up with:

The jury retired and an hour later came back with a verdict that the 27 people who were the subject of the inquest had died due to the gross negligence of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson. The coroner, therefore, committed all three to the next sitting of Cumberland Assizes on a charge of manslaughter; all three were granted bail.

The solicitor representing the three railwaymen protested that the committing of them to trial was outside the coroner&#x27;s jurisdiction, as the alleged offence had been committed in Scotland. The coroner stated that he had been instructed to proceed with the inquest by the Home Office. The verdict of the English inquest was to leave Tinsley in an unusual position, as he was arrested by the Scottish authorities on 29 May 1915, and charged with culpable homicide. He now faced a charge of manslaughter in England based on the same facts. After discussion between the Law Officers of England and Scotland, it was decided to proceed against the three men in Scotland.

The three had become the first men ever to be indicted for the same crime in two UK countries.

===Trial of Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson===
The trial of the three men started on 24 September 1915 in the High Court in Edinburgh. The Lord Justice General, Lord Strathclyde, presided over the trial; the Lord Advocate, Robert Munro KC prosecuted and the three men were defended by Condie Sandeman KC. Tinsley, Meakin and Hutchinson all pleaded not guilty to the charges of culpable homicide and breach of duty against them. The trial lasted a day and a half; after the prosecution had concluded their case, Sandeman submitted to the Lord Justice General that there was no case to answer by Hutchinson. The Lord Justice General accepted this submission, and the jury was instructed to find him not guilty at the conclusion of the trial. Sandeman called no witnesses on the part of Meakin and Tinsley but instead sought to persuade the jury that neither had been criminally negligent but that Tinsley had just had a momentary loss of memory.

After Sandeman&#x27;s speech, Lord Strathclyde summed up to the jury, ending:
At 6.43 am on the morning of the day in question, the men in the signal box at Quintinshill were asked to accept the troop train coming from the north. They accepted it. That meant that they gave the signal to the north that the line was clear and that the troop train might safely come on. At that very moment when the signal was given, there was before the very eyes of the men in the signal box a local train which was obstructing the line on which the troop train was to run. One man in the signal box had actually left the train a few minutes before, just at the time when it was being shunted onto the up line. The other man had a few minutes before directed the local train to leave the down main and go on to the up main.&lt;br&gt;
That is the staggering fact that confronts you.&lt;br&gt;
If you can explain that fact consistently with the two men having faithfully and honestly discharged their duties you should acquit them. If you cannot explain that staggering fact consistently with the men having faithfully discharged their duties then you must convict them.

The jury retired to consider their verdicts at 12.40 pm and returned only eight minutes later, finding Hutchinson not guilty as directed but finding Tinsley and Meakin guilty as charged. After hearing mitigation on behalf of the two Lord Strathclyde sentenced Tinsley to three years penal servitude and Meakin to eighteen months imprisonment.

===Fatal accident inquiry in Scotland===

The final legal inquiry into the disaster was held on 4 November 1915 in Dumfries and was an inquiry under the Fatal Accidents Inquiry (Scotland) Act 1895 into the deaths of the crew of the troop train. Presided over by Sheriff Campion, it came to the same conclusion as the English inquest and the trial that if Meakin and Tinsley had followed the rules, then the accident would not have happened.

==After the trial==
Meakin and Tinsley were released from prison on 15 December 1916. After release, Tinsley went straight back to working on the Caledonian Railway as a lampman. He died in 1967. Meakin also returned to the railway as a goods train guard. Some years later, he was fired from that job and set himself up as a coal merchant, trading from Quintinshill siding, right next to the scene of the crash. During World War II, he worked in the Gretna munitions factory until he retired due to ill health. He died in 1953.

The pair were neither the first nor the last signalmen to be convicted for their part in causing an accident. James Holmes was tried for manslaughter following the 1892 Thirsk rail crash but was given an absolute discharge. Signalman Frost was gaoled for two years for his part in causing the Connington South rail crash in 1967.

==2015 BBC re-examination==
In a BBC Television documentary, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Deadliest Rail Disaster: Quintinshill&quot;, first aired on 20 May 2015, the disaster was re-examined from a modern perspective. It argued that both signalmen had been made scapegoats for the crashes and found fault with both the railway company and the government (who ran the railway in wartime). Going further, citing the fact both men returned to work after their sentences, it postulated there had been some conspiracy between the company and the men to take sole blame for the accident.

It criticised the railway company&#x27;s attitude to its own rules, which the documentary alleged it must have known were not routinely followed to the letter - arguing that the tardy practices of turning up late for a shift change would have, at the very least, been known to their immediate managers. It also claimed the use of safety collars was not universal on the railway and expected it was impractical (citing that some railway companies did not use them for just that reason).

It also found fault with the railway company&#x27;s desire to run a peacetime service to maintain profits, even though the network was experiencing extra war-time traffic. Citing the pressure this would have put on signal staff to maintain the service, it also argued that the local train would not have even been on the main line if the passing loops had not been being used as storage sidings to store extra trains. It also criticised the railway company and the government for using the older wooden stock for the troop train, arguing that it was already known it was unsafe and in the process of withdrawal. This was a risk that was not justified even in the environment of war.

It also sought to take some blame away from Tinsley because he may have been suffering from a form of epilepsy which affected his short-term memory, which they argued would have explained why he might have simply not been aware of the waiting local train.

==Memorials==
As well as the memorial in Rosebank Cemetery, there is a plaque at Larbert railway station, from where the soldiers originally departed. Two memorials have been erected by the Western Front Association, the first in 1995, half a mile to the south of the scene of the accident. The second is at Blacksyke Bridge, west of the scene; it was unveiled in September 2010. A memorial to the unknown children was erected at the Western Necropolis in Glasgow in 2011. There is also a memorial to Lt Cdr C H E Head, who died in the accident, in St Ann&#x27;s Church at Portsea, Hampshire.

Annual remembrance services are held at Rosebank Cemetery attended by the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and the Royal Scots association. There were commemorative services at Gretna for the centenary of the disaster on 22 May 2015 and at Rosebank Cemetery on 23 May. They were attended by the First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, and the Princess Royal.

On 22 May 2015, a remembrance quarter peal was rung and new method named &#x27;Quintinshill&#x27; by bellringers at St Peter&#x27;s Church, Derby.

In 2017 a new housing area in Leith was given the street names Quintinshill Place and Gretna Place in memory of the disaster.

== Similar accidents ==
The Hawes Junction rail crash of 1910 also involved a busy signalman forgetting about a train on the main railway line. Likewise, at the Winwick rail crash of 1934, an overworked signalman forgot about a train in his section, and was misled by a junior.

<text>Fredericia () is a town located in Fredericia Municipality in the southeastern part of the Jutland peninsula in Denmark. The city is part of the Triangle Region, which includes the neighbouring cities of Kolding and Vejle. It was founded in 1650 by Frederick III, after whom it was named.

The city itself has a population of 41,544 (1 January 2024) and the Fredericia Municipality has a population of 52,485 (2024).

==History==
After the devastation caused by the Thirty Years War in a largely unfortified Jutland, King Christian IV realized the necessity of building a strong fortress in Jutland, and decided that this project could be combined with his plans for building a large town in Jutland.

A fortified encampment was built on a point of land called Lyngs Odde, near the current location of Fredericia, with a rampart stretching to either side of the point, thus protecting the encampment from attacks. However, the fortifications were not perfect, and when Swedish Field Marshal Lennart Torstenson invaded Jutland, he was able to break through the ramparts. It was Frederick III who was finally able to complete the plans for the fortification, also adding a flank fortification on nearby Bers Odde as suggested by Danish Marshal of the Realm Anders Bille.

On 15 December 1650, the King signed the document giving the town its first privileges, and work on the new fortifications could begin. In 1651, the town was named Frederiksodde (Frederick&#x27;s Point) after the king, and on 22 April 1664, it was given the new Latinized name of Fredericia.

Every 6 July, the town of Fredericia holds a festival to commemorate the 1849 Battle of Fredericia, fought during the First War of Schleswig, in which Danish troops won a victory over the Schleswig-Holstein rebels who were laying siege to the town. Fredericia&#x27;s landmark, &quot;Landsoldaten&quot;, was unveiled on 6 July 1858.

==Present==
The municipality today is part of the East Jutland metropolitan area with 1.2M inhabitants, and is the site of Fredericia municipality&#x27;s municipal council.

The town is a major barracks, home to the Royal Danish Army&#x27;s Signals Regiment (&quot;Telegrafregimentet&quot;), which is located at Rye&#x27;s Barracks (&quot;Ryes Kaserne&quot;) and Bülow&#x27;s Barracks (&quot;Bülows Kaserne&quot;).

==Transportation==
The town is one of Denmark&#x27;s largest traffic hubs.

===Rail===

Fredericia railway station is the principal railway station of the town. It is an important railway junction where the Copenhagen-Fredericia Line, the Fredericia-Aarhus Line, and the Flensburg-Fredericia Line all meet. The station was opened in 1935 together with the opening of the Little Belt Bridge across the Little Belt. The train services are operated by the railway company DSB. It offers direct InterCity services to Copenhagen, Odense, Aarhus, Aalborg, Struer, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Flensburg and Hamburg.

<doc id="624818" wikidata="Q2310801" url="?curid=624818" title="Botswana National Front">
<text>The Botswana National Front (BNF) is a social democratic political party in Botswana. It was the main opposition party in Botswana from the 1969 elections until the 2024 elections. It is the largest component of the governing Umbrella for Democratic Change coalition; party leader Duma Boko has been president of Botswana since 2024.

Until 2024, the party’s greatest electoral success was in the 1994 elections, when it won 37.1% of the vote and 13 of 40 parliamentary seats. A factional conflict in 1998 led to the departure of 11 of these MPs, who then founded the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). In the 1999 elections, the BNF&#x27;s vote share declined to 26% and it won 6 parliamentary seats. In the 2004 general election the party won 26.1% of the popular vote and 12 out of 57 seats. Its representation was sharply reduced in the 2009 elections, with the party reduced to only six seats in the National Assembly of Botswana. The BNF&#x27;s parliamentary representation fell to 5 seats following the defection of the party&#x27;s former Vice President, Olebile Gaborone, to the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP) in July 2010.

== History ==
The BNF was founded in 1965, shortly after the Botswana Democratic Party (BDP)&#x27;s landslide victory in the self-government elections and just before Botswana gained independence. The initial goal of the BNF was to reunite the various strands of the Botswana People&#x27;s Party, which had experienced a split in 1963–1964, and others opposed to the BDP. In 1969, Bathoen Gaseitsiwe resigned from his state-recognized position as chief of the Bangwaketse (a group in Southern Botswana) and joined the BNF. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the BNF was a loose alliance between conservative tribal leaders concerned with the preservation of traditional authority, led by Bathoen Gaseitsiwe, and socialists, led by Kenneth Koma, concerned over the bourgeois policies of the government. The first time that the party had been represented nationally was in 1969 when they won three seats in the Ngwaketse region.

The BNF was largely a regional party associated with the Ngwaketse region in the 1970s, but it gradually gained support in other parts of the country. In the 1984 general elections, the BNF gained control of the Gaborone City Council and other urban councils; it also won five of 34 parliamentary seats. In 1994, 13 BNF candidates were elected as members of the National Assembly (out of 40 total). Prior to the elections, the party redefined itself in terms of the ideology of social democracy. It was an observer member of the Socialist International. By 1994 the party had adopted the motto &quot;Time for change&quot;. The electoral success and change of motto largely reflected decreased standard of living, civil unrest and rising levels of AIDS in the country.

There have been a number of internal squabbles in the party due largely to factionalism. This has led to the splitting of the party a number of times and the formation of splinter parties whose political ideologies are not appreciably different from that of the BNF. Several splinter parties formed in 1989 and 1994, but the most serious split occurred in 1998 when a dispute over Kenneth Koma&#x27;s leadership resulted in the departure of the majority of the party&#x27;s parliamentary wing (11 of 13 MPs) and the formation of the Botswana Congress Party (BCP). The split followed an aborted BNF party congress, dissolution of the central committee by Koma, and a bitter court case. In 2003, ongoing factional conflict prompted the BNF&#x27;s founder, Kenneth Koma, to form the New Democratic Front. Of these splinter parties, the BCP has gained the most popular support.

In elections in 1999 and 2004, vote-splitting between the BNF and the BCP reduced the parliamentary representation of both the BNF and the opposition as a whole. The BNF retained only 6 of its 13 parliamentary seats in 1999 and the BCP won only one seat. An increase in the number of constituencies from 40 to 57 allowed the BNF to win 12 seats in 2009 despite no meaningful change in its vote share. The BCP did not benefit from the expansion of seats and again won only one seat.

Until July 2010, the party was led by Otsweletse Moupo. Moupo himself has emphasized the need to help the poor escape from poverty. Moupo experienced a number of public embarrassments in 2006 that led to serious and mounting challenges from within the party. Moupo&#x27;s leadership was reaffirmed at a special party congress in 2007, but his opponents continued to challenge his leadership. In 2008 and 2009, the BNF suspended or expelled several prominent members, including several of its parliamentary representatives, and fought several court battles related to primary elections.

In the 2009 elections, several former members of the BNF ran as independent candidates, referring to themselves as the Temporary Platform. The BNF suffered significant losses; it won six seats. The BCP formed an electoral pact with the Botswana Alliance Movement and the NDF and increased its representation from one seat to five. Vote-splitting continues to be a problem in that the BDP often wins seats when all three parties are competitive. This occurs most often in urban areas. But the BDP also took seats from the BNF in rural constituencies where the BCP did not have a candidate.

Otsweletse Moupo decided that he would not defend his position as party president and Duma Boko was elected as the new party president in July 2010. In the 2013 congress that will be held in Gantsi, Comrade Monang will challenge Comrade Boko in what seems to be a David vs Goliath war.

<text>Gareth Daniel Noake Thomas (12 February 1945 – 13 April 2016) was a British actor. He rose to national prominence playing the role of Roj Blake in the BBC science fiction television series &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978–1981).

== Early life==
Thomas was born on 12 February 1945 in Brentford, England, and grew up in Aberystwyth, Wales. He was the younger of two sons of Kenneth Thomas, a barrister who had been a junior at the Nuremberg trials, and his wife, Olga (&quot;née&quot; Noake). Thomas attended the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury. He then trained at RADA and later became an Associate Member. He was a member of the National Youth Theatre, appearing with them in the 1967 production of &quot;Zigger Zagger&quot;.

==Career==
Thomas made many television appearances, including &quot;The Avengers&quot;, &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Special Branch&quot;, &quot;Sutherland&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;Public Eye&quot;, &quot;Who Pays the Ferryman?&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot;, &quot;By the Sword Divided&quot;, &quot;The Citadel&quot;, &quot;Knights of God&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Taggart&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot;, &quot;Torchwood&quot;, &quot;Children of the Stones&quot;, &quot;Star Maidens, and &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;.

He appeared on stage in many productions. His appearances include RSC productions of &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, &quot;Othello&quot; and &quot;Anna Christie&quot;; English Shakespeare Company productions of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; and &quot;Henry V&quot;; and &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Educating Rita&quot;, &quot;Cat on a Hot Tin Roof&quot;, &quot;The Crucible&quot;, &quot;Equus&quot; and &quot;Déjà Vu&quot;. In 2000, Thomas was the first subject of MJTV&#x27;s interview/drama CD series &quot;The Actor Speaks&quot;. In one of the interviews he spoke about his character Roj Blake, leader of the crew of the &quot;Liberator&quot; in &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot;. From 1999 to 2005, he took part in 12 out of 14 CD episodes of MJTV&#x27;s original audio comedy sci-fi drama series &quot;Soldiers of Love&quot;, in which he played camp Welsh TV host Hywel Hammond and villain of the piece Aaron Arkenstein. In 2010, Thomas gave an acclaimed performance as Ephraim Cabot in &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; at the New Vic Theatre.

In 2001, he appeared in &quot;Storm Warning&quot;, an audio drama by Big Finish Productions, based on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He also played the part of Kalendorf in the Big Finish Productions &quot;Dalek Empire&quot; series. In 2006 he appeared as a guest star in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series &quot;Torchwood&quot;, in the episode &quot;Ghost Machine&quot;. Thomas returned to the role of Roj Blake in 2012, in Big Finish Productions&#x27; &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7: The Liberator Chronicles&quot;, a series of dramatic readings which take place during Series One before the death of Olag Gan. Thomas starred as Blake in &quot;Counterfeit&quot; by Peter Anghelides and &quot;False Positive&quot; by Eddie Robson. In 2013 he appeared as Brother Cadfael in Middle Ground Theatre Company&#x27;s adaption of &quot;The Virgin in the Ice&quot; by Ellis Peters. He was twice nominated for a BAFTA, for his performances in &quot;Stocker&#x27;s Copper&quot; (BBC &quot;Play for Today&quot;, 1972) and &quot;Morgan&#x27;s Boy&quot; (1984).

&quot;Morgan&#x27;s Boy&quot; was his favourite television role, but &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; won bigger audiences.

==Personal life==
Thomas had two children with his first wife, Annie; this marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, Sheelagh Wells, was a make-up artist who had worked on &quot;Blakes 7&quot;; this marriage also ended in divorce. His third wife was Linda. After many years living in the Scottish Borders, he moved to Surrey in 2009.

==Death==
Thomas died in Surrey on 13 April 2016 of heart failure, aged 71. His &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; co-star Stephen Greif paid tribute, saying he was &quot;very sad to hear of the death of my good friend Gareth Thomas. We were at RADA then Blake&#x27;s 7 and onwards. He was a proud Welshman.&quot;

<text>Children of the Stones is a British television fantasy drama serial for children, produced by HTV in 1976 and broadcast on the United Kingdom&#x27;s ITV network in January and February 1977. The serial was produced by Peter Graham Scott, with Patrick Dromgoole as executive producer. A novelisation by the serial&#x27;s writers, Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray, also appeared in 1977. In the United States, it was broadcast on the Nickelodeon television channel in the early 1980s as part of the series, &quot;The Third Eye&quot;.

The series is today considered a landmark in quality children&#x27;s drama.

==Overview==

The series follows the adventures of astrophysicist Adam Brake and his teenage son Matthew after they arrive in the small village of Milbury, which is built in the midst of a megalithic stone circle.

Filmed at Avebury, Wiltshire during the hot summer of 1976, with interior scenes filmed at HTV&#x27;s Bristol studios, it has sinister, discordant wailing voices heightening the tension in the incidental music. The music was composed by Sidney Sager who used the Ambrosian Singers to chant in accordance with the megalithic rituals referred to in the story. Director Peter Graham Scott was surprised on seeing the script that the series was intended for children&#x27;s airtime due to the complexities of the plot and the disturbing nature of the series.

Cast as the leader of the village, Hendrick, was Iain Cuthbertson, while the leading role of Adam Brake was filled by Gareth Thomas. Cuthbertson and Thomas had previously worked together on the TV series &quot;Sutherland&#x27;s Law&quot;. Veronica Strong (the wife of series co-writer Jeremy Burnham) played Margaret Smythe, the curator of the local museum, who partners with Brake to solve the mystery. The child actors Peter Demin (aged 17 at the time of filming) and Katharine Levy played the teenage leads, Matthew (Brake&#x27;s son) and Sandra (Smythe&#x27;s daughter). Freddie Jones and John Woodnutt were cast as poacher Dai and butler Link.

The series was repeated by ITV from 21 July 1978 to 1 September 1978, at 4:15 p.m. Since then the show has not been broadcast in its entirety on UK television, either terrestrial or satellite.

==Plot outline==
The village within the stone circle exists in a time rift, in which the same actions are played out (with minor variations) over and over again, the end result being that the power of the circle will eventually be released to the outside world. Whenever this is faulted, however, the time circle resets and the same events attempt again to unfold. However, since time is passing in the outside world in a normal way, time within the time circle must also progress, matching the time period of the real world while still attempting to play out the events within.

Four cycles of the time circle are clearly described in &quot;Children of the Stones&quot;.

===The original circle===
The original stone circle was built during the megalithic era by a pagan folk led by a Druid priest. The village priest then witnessed the formation of a supernova and somehow deduced that a black hole had formed shortly afterwards. Using a variety of psychic powers, mixed with folk magic, the priest was able to harness the power of the stones, which are natural magnets, and focus negative energy, via a beam of light, through the centre of the circle towards the black hole. This energy, however, was drawn from the minds of the inhabitants within the circle, taking their anger and fear to the black hole, and turning them into docile but happy creatures (hence &quot;happy day&quot;) under the control of the Druid priest.

When a pair of travellers entered the village the Druid priest attempted to brainwash them as well, through the beam of light towards the black hole. The travellers outwitted the priest, however, and tricked him into thinking they had been brainwashed when the beam of light had not yet appeared. When the two travellers entered the circle of those who had already been taken in by the priest the circle of control was broken. The beam of light then appeared, much to the priest&#x27;s horror, destroying his altar and turning the inhabitants of the circle to stone. The two travellers barely managed to escape the same fate and survived by hiding in a rock cave towards the edge of the stone circle, known as the sanctuary.

The events of the original circle were later recorded in a painting, which eventually made its way to become a key point of another cycle of the time circle.

===The barber-surgeon===
The barber-surgeon was an inhabitant of the village of Milbury, which had been built on the site of the stone circle. The events of the first circle began to unfold again in Milbury. The barber-surgeon, seeing what was taking place, protected himself by use of an amulet. The amulet was palm-sized and inscribed with a winged serpent.

The barber-surgeon presented a threat to whoever restarted the events of the First Circle and was crushed under a falling sarsen stone, also engraved with a serpent like the amulet the barber-surgeon carried. The amulet was crushed, along with the barber-surgeon; however, his bones were later removed and the stone that killed him was re-erected within the circle. Whoever caused the barber-surgeon to die did not succeed, and the time circle again reset itself into the modern age.

Dai the poacher&#x27;s life, death and activities are markedly similar to those of the barber-surgeon, suggesting a link between the two characters.

===Children of the Stones===
The Time Circle again took another loop in the 1970s, when an astronomer, Rafael Hendrick, uncovered an ancient Dog Latin text about the Druid priest who saw a supernova explode in ancient times. Hendrick discovered the location of the supernova, a discovery that made him famous, and further learned that the supernova was now a black hole in the constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear.

Hendrick then travelled to Milbury, the site of the stone circle, and, through means left unexplained, learned how to harness the negative energy of the villagers into the beam of light towards the black hole. Through complex astronomical calculations he determined exactly when he could form the energy beam and began brainwashing the villagers into becoming what he called &quot;Happy Ones&quot;.

The one challenge to Hendrick is posed by a poacher named Dai, but Dai suffers a mysterious death in the same location as the Barber-Surgeon had years earlier. Dai&#x27;s body is also apparently replaced by a fallen stone carved with a serpent, but then both the stone and the body vanish. After Dai is killed pieces of a broken amulet are found, with those pieces matching exactly the gaps in the broken amulet of the Barber-Surgeon.

With nothing to stop Hendrick, one by one the villagers are brainwashed by the beam of light. Professor Brake&#x27;s son, Matthew, is apparently psychic and has come across a painting that depicts the scene of the first circle. By the time Hendrick seeks to brainwash Brake and his son both have worked out that Milbury is replaying the events of the first circle and attempt to find a way to escape.

In the final episode Professor Brake and Matthew set Hendrick&#x27;s digital timekeeping system ahead by five minutes, tricking Hendrick into thinking that they have been brainwashed by the energy beam. When they enter the circle of &quot;Happy Ones&quot; the power is broken. Hendrick is exposed to the beam of light and is metamorphosed into an image of the ancient Druid priest, while his butler, Link, covers his eyes for protection. The villagers are then turned to stone when they look at the beam of light from Hendrick&#x27;s house. Professor Brake and Matthew attempt to save their friends Margaret and her daughter Sandra, but they both ignore warnings not to look back at the light and meet the same fate as the other villagers. The professor and his son escape to the Sanctuary, just as the ancient travellers did. When Brake and Matthew awake the next morning the village has changed back to normal, with only minor variations, and there is no sign that Hendrick or his plan ever existed.

The Brakes return to their lodging house and find Margaret, Sandra and the Brakes&#x27; housekeeper, who were all victims of the stone circle&#x27;s power the previous evening, are now living their normal lives with no memory of recent events. Even the poacher, Dai, is now alive again and living in the Sanctuary. When the Brakes question him about what has happened, he admits he knows Professor Brake and Matthew but tells them he has no time for riddles, is not their friend, and to leave. As they do so, the serpent pattern from the amulet is seen below Dai&#x27;s seat arranged in a pattern of bones. The Brakes then depart Milbury and Matthew wonders if the Time Circle has reset and if the events they have recently witnessed will happen again. Professor Brake jokingly asks Matthew if he would like to go back to the village and find out, but Matthew asks him to drive far away and to only stop off somewhere for something to eat.

===Sir Joshua Litton===
In the final scene of the series, shortly after Professor Brake and Matthew depart from the village a well-dressed man in an expensive motor car drives into Milbury. He looks identical to Rafael Hendrick. The man drives to Hendrick&#x27;s old house, where he meets Link, Hendrick&#x27;s former butler in the last round of the Time Circle, who now has a moustache and looks considerably younger.

The gentleman introduces himself as Sir Joshua Litton, a former professor at the University of Cambridge, and explains that he has come to Milbury from London. He comments on what a nice place Milbury will be to retire to and says that he will be very happy there.

== Critical reception ==
Television historians Alistair McGown and Mark Docherty lauded the acting in &quot;Children of the Stones&quot;. They stated that &quot;Iain Cuthbertson, one of the small screen’s most ebullient character actors, gives perhaps the most carefully subdued performance of his career in the serial&quot;. McGown and Docherty also praised the show&#x27;s script, stating that &quot;The script is a fairly complex blend of supernatural horror and science fiction which never talks down to the audience&quot;.

Stewart Lee commended the series in the 2007 BBC Four series &quot;Charlie Brooker&#x27;s Screenwipe&quot;. Lee commented on depictions of teenagers on television in different decades, contrasting &quot;Children of the Stones&quot; with the Channel 4 drama &quot;Skins&quot; and arguing that &quot;Children of the Stones&quot; is still relevant to a modern audience. Several clips of the story were shown.

In 2012 Lee narrated a documentary on the series for BBC Radio Four. It was introduced as &quot;the scariest programme ever made for children&quot; and the music was described as &quot;the most inappropriate theme music ever used for a children&#x27;s series&quot;. Among the interviewees were Gareth Thomas and Katharine Levy, who both praised the high quality of the script. Levy said that the finished programme surpassed all their expectations and still stood up well. Jeremy Burnham, co-writer of the script, stated that although it was only seven episodes long, the series had stayed with him ever since due to the fans&#x27; interest.

Adam Scovell, writing for the British Film Institute, cited &quot;Children of the Stones&quot; as an example of the &quot;folk horror&quot; subgenre, because of the serial&#x27;s use of an isolated rural setting and theme of ancient folklore awakening in the modern world.

==Availability==
&quot;Children of the Stones&quot; was first released on Guild Home Video in 1981, becoming one of the earliest children&#x27;s dramas to be released on the format. Due to an error on the front and rear of the sleeve listing it as running 1hr 38 mins, it was assumed to be in a heavily edited form. The tape however ran at 2hrs 32mins, meaning only that the opening and closing credits from the middle episodes had been removed, and certain scenes reordered. For example; In episode 1, we see Matthew fall from his bike before his father touches the stone. In the video version, we see him fall immediately after that scene. The series was re-released in 1992, again as a single uninterrupted feature. The serial has been released on DVD in 2002 by Second Sight in the UK and by Acorn Media in the US. The DVD includes interviews with actor Gareth Thomas and producer Peter Graham Scott. The series was released once more in 2011 by Network. Unusually for a children&#x27;s series, it was given a 12 certificate.

The serial was novelised by series writers Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray and released by Carousel Books in 1977. It was released in the US two years later. The novelisation was released in audiobook format by Fantom Films in August 2014, read by Gareth Thomas.

==Sequel==
A sequel, &quot;Return to the Stones&quot; by Jeremy Burnham and Trevor Ray, was published as a Kindle e-book in November 2012 followed by the hardback edition on 8 July 2013.

==Podcast==
The BBC issued a new audio adaptation as a 10-episode podcast in October 2020. It starred Reece Shearsmith, India Brown, Steve Oram and Ralph Ineson.

<text>A software wizard or setup assistant or multi-step form is a user interface that leads a user through a sequence of small steps, such as a dialog box to configure a program for the first time. They are used to make complex, unfamiliar tasks easier by breaking them into smaller pieces.

== History ==
Before the 1990s, &quot;wizard&quot; was a common term for a technical expert, comparable to &quot;hacker.&quot; The 1985 textbook Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs was nicknamed the &quot;Wizard Book&quot; for the illustration on its cover; its first chapter says, &quot;A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer&#x27;s idea of a spirit.&quot;

When developing the first version of its desktop publishing software, Microsoft Publisher, around 1991, Microsoft wanted to help users create well-presented documents in spite of their lack of graphic design skills. Microsoft reasoned that, no matter the tools a program offered, users would not know how best to use them. Publisher&#x27;s &quot;Page Wizards&quot; instead provided a set of forms to produce a complete document layout, based on a professionally designed template, which could then be manipulated with the standard tools.

Wizards had been in development at Microsoft for several years before Publisher, notably for Microsoft Access, which wouldn&#x27;t ship until November 1992. Wizards were intended to learn from how someone used a program and anticipate what they may want to do next, guiding them through more complex sets of tasks by structuring and sequencing them. They also served to teach the product by example. As early as 1989, Microsoft discussed using voice and talking heads as guides, but multimedia-capable hardware was not yet widespread.

The feature spread quickly to other applications. In 1992, Excel 4.0 for Mac introduced wizards for tasks like building crosstab tables; Office 95 introduced the &quot;Answer Wizard&quot; for querying help pages with natural language; and Windows later used wizards for tasks like adding a printer, configuring an Internet connection, or installing new applications. By 2001, wizards had become commonplace in most consumer-oriented operating systems. 

On the Mac OS, starting with tools like the Setup Assistant introduced in Mac OS 8.0, similar tools began to be called &quot;assistants&quot; (not to be confused with the Apple Newton&#x27;s &quot;Assist&quot; feature). The &quot;Setup Assistant&quot; is run when the Macintosh starts up out of the box or after a fresh installation, and a similar process also takes place on Apple iOS. The &quot;Network Setup Assistant&quot; is similar to the Windows &quot;New Connection Wizard.&quot; GNOME also refers to its wizards as &quot;assistants&quot;. Oracle Designer used wizards for designing applications and databases.

The Microsoft Manual of Style (Version 3.0) advises technical writers to refer to these assistants as &quot;wizards&quot; and to use lowercase letters. But as wizards became ubiquitous, the term disappeared. Apps and websites may use wizard-like guided steps to &quot;onboard&quot; new users or guide them through a task, but these features are often not explicitly labeled a &quot;wizard&quot;.

==Example==
The following screenshots show part of the seven-step installation wizard for the operating system Kubuntu. Each step is necessary, but unrelated to the others; they are presented one at a time, so as not to overwhelm. The user can go back and forward through the steps; early steps also have an option to quit. Options may default to a choice, so that a user without an opinion can accept the designer&#x27;s best judgment. Progress through the steps is shown on the left. The last screen has no options or inputs, but summarizes what was done.
== Criticism ==
Wizards have been criticized for being ponderous, stripping questions of context, and obscuring the underlying operations. The criticism is common enough that one guide to wizard design starts by addressing the popular perception that a wizard is &quot;just a patch for a bad interface&quot;.

Alan Cooper sees wizards as segregating new and expert users, abdicating the responsibility of designing a single coherent interface; they are &quot;grafted on to meet the marketing department&#x27;s perception of new users. Experts rarely use them, and beginners soon desire to discard these embarrassing reminders of their ignorance. But the perpetual intermediate majority is perpetually stuck with them.&quot; He compares them to training wheels that must be easily removed. A wizard &quot;attempts to guarantee success&quot; by treating the user as a machine who merely sets the rhythm of the steps; when every option has a default, &quot;the user learns that he merely clicks the Next button on each screen without critically analyzing why.&quot; Wizards often don&#x27;t clarify the underlying concepts, he writes; &quot;They are giving programmers license to put raw implementation model interfaces on complex features with the bland assurance that: &#x27;We&#x27;ll make it easy with a wizard.

<text>Henry Lee Giclas (December 9, 1910 – April 2, 2007) was an American astronomer and a discoverer of minor planets and comets. best known for hiring Robert Burnham Jr. at the Lowell Observatory. He worked on a notable proper motion survey with several relatively nearby stars bearing his name such as Giclas 99-49.

Henry Giclas is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of 17 numbered minor planets between 1943 and 1978, including 2201 Oljato – tentatively identified as the parent body of the &quot;Chi Orionids&quot; meteor shower – and 2061 Anza, two near-Earth asteroids of the Apollo and Amor group, respectively.

He also discovered 84P/Giclas in 1978, a periodic comet of the Jupiter family.

Henry Giclas died of a stroke at the age of 96 in Flagstaff, Arizona. The crater &quot;Giclas&quot; on Pluto, as well as the asteroid 1741 Giclas, discovered by the Indiana Asteroid Program in 1960, are named for him.

<doc id="624839" wikidata="Q15238499" url="?curid=624839" title="Monte Carlo algorithm">
<text>In computing, a Monte Carlo algorithm is a randomized algorithm whose output may be incorrect with a certain (typically small) probability. Two examples of such algorithms are the Karger–Stein algorithm and the Monte Carlo algorithm for minimum feedback arc set.

The name refers to the Monte Carlo casino in the Principality of Monaco, which is well-known around the world as an icon of gambling. The term &quot;Monte Carlo&quot; was first introduced in 1947 by Nicholas Metropolis.

Las Vegas algorithms are a dual of Monte Carlo algorithms and never return an incorrect answer. However, they may make random choices as part of their work. As a result, the time taken might vary between runs, even with the same input.

If there is a procedure for verifying whether the answer given by a Monte Carlo algorithm is correct, and the probability of a correct answer is bounded above zero, then with probability one, running the algorithm repeatedly while testing the answers will eventually give a correct answer. Whether this process is a Las Vegas algorithm depends on whether halting with probability one is considered to satisfy the definition.

==One-sided vs two-sided error==
While the answer returned by a deterministic algorithm is always expected to be correct, this is not the case for Monte Carlo algorithms. For decision problems, these algorithms are generally classified as either false-biased or true-biased. A false-biased Monte Carlo algorithm is always correct when it returns false; a true-biased algorithm is always correct when it returns true. While this describes algorithms with &quot;one-sided errors&quot;, others might have no bias; these are said to have &quot;two-sided errors&quot;. The answer they provide (either true or false) will be incorrect, or correct, with some bounded probability.

For instance, the Solovay–Strassen primality test is used to determine whether a given number is a prime number. It always answers true for prime number inputs; for composite inputs, it answers false with probability at least and true with probability less than . Thus, false answers from the algorithm are certain to be correct, whereas the true answers remain uncertain; this is said to be a &quot;-correct false-biased algorithm&quot;.

==Amplification==
For a Monte Carlo algorithm with one-sided errors, the failure probability can be reduced (and the success probability amplified) by running the algorithm &quot;k&quot; times. Consider again the Solovay–Strassen algorithm which is &quot;-correct false-biased&quot;. One may run this algorithm multiple times returning a false answer if it reaches a false response within &quot;k&quot; iterations, and otherwise returning true. Thus, if the number is prime then the answer is always correct, and if the number is composite then the answer is correct with probability at least 1−(1−)&quot;k&quot; = 1−2&quot;−k&quot;.

For Monte Carlo decision algorithms with two-sided error, the failure probability may again be reduced by running the algorithm &quot;k&quot; times and returning the majority function of the answers.

==Complexity classes==
The complexity class BPP describes decision problems that can be solved by polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithms with a bounded probability of two-sided errors, and the complexity class RP describes problems that can be solved by a Monte Carlo algorithm with a bounded probability of one-sided error: if the correct answer is false, the algorithm always says so, but it may answer false incorrectly for some instances where the correct answer is true. In contrast, the complexity class ZPP describes problems solvable by polynomial expected time Las Vegas algorithms. , but it is not known whether any of these complexity classes is distinct from each other; that is, Monte Carlo algorithms may have more computational power than Las Vegas algorithms, but this has not been proven. Another complexity class, PP, describes decision problems with a polynomial-time Monte Carlo algorithm that is more accurate than flipping a coin but where the error probability cannot necessarily be bounded away from .

== Classes of Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms ==
Randomized algorithms are primarily divided by its two main types, Monte Carlo and Las Vegas, however, these represent only a top of the hierarchy and can be further categorized.

* Las Vegas
** Sherwood—&quot;performant and effective special case of Las Vegas&quot;
** Numerical—&quot;numerical Las Vegas&quot;
* Monte Carlo
** Atlantic City—&quot;bounded error special case of Monte Carlo&quot;
** Numerical—&quot;numerical approximation Monte Carlo&quot;

&quot;Both Las Vegas and Monte Carlo are dealing with decisions, i.e., problems in their decision version.&quot; &quot;This however should not give a wrong impression and confine these algorithms to such problems—both types of randomized algorithms can be used on numerical problems as well, problems where the output is not simple ‘yes’/‘no’, but where one needs to receive a result that is numerical in nature.&quot;

Previous table represents a general framework for Monte Carlo and Las Vegas randomized algorithms. Instead of the mathematical symbol formula_1 one could use formula_2, thus making probabilities in the worst case equal.

==Applications in computational number theory and other areas==
Well-known Monte Carlo algorithms include the Solovay–Strassen primality test, the Baillie–PSW primality test, the Miller–Rabin primality test, and certain fast variants of the Schreier–Sims algorithm in computational group theory.

For algorithms that are a part of Stochastic Optimization (SO) group of algorithms, where probability is not known in advance and is empirically determined, it is sometimes possible to merge Monte Carlo and such an algorithm &quot;to have both probability bound calculated in advance and a Stochastic Optimization component.&quot; &quot;Example of such an algorithm is Ant Inspired Monte Carlo.&quot; In this way, &quot;drawback of SO has been mitigated, and a confidence in a solution has been established.&quot;

<doc id="624840" wikidata="Q1472266" url="?curid=624840" title="Kate Greenaway Medal">
<text>The Carnegie Medal for Illustration (until 2022 the Kate Greenaway Medal) is a British award that annually recognises &quot;distinguished illustration in a book for children&quot;. It is conferred upon the illustrator by the Chartered Institute of Library and Information Professionals (CILIP) which inherited it from the Library Association. 

The Medal is named after the 19th-century English illustrator of children&#x27;s books Kate Greenaway (1846–1901). It was established in 1955 and inaugurated in 1956 for 1955 publications, but no work that year was considered suitable. The first Medal was awarded in 1957 to Edward Ardizzone for &quot;Tim All Alone&quot; (Oxford, 1956), which he also wrote. That first Medal was dated 1956. Since 2007 the Medal has been dated by its presentation during the year following publication. This medal is a companion to the Carnegie Medal for Writing which recognises an outstanding work of writing for children and young adults.

Nominated books must be first published in the U.K. during the preceding school year (September to August), with English-language text if any.

The award by CILIP is a gold Medal and £500 worth of books donated to the illustrator&#x27;s chosen library. Since 2000 there is also a £5000 cash prize from a bequest by the children&#x27;s book collector Colin Mears.

==Rules==
Library and information professionals in CILIP nominate books in September and October, after the close of the publication year. A panel of 12 children&#x27;s librarians in CILIP&#x27;s youth interest group judges both the Carnegie and Greenaway books. The shortlist is announced in March and the winner in June.

Candidates must be published in the U.K. during the preceding year (September to August). They must be published for young people, and published in the U.K. originally or within three months in case of co-publication. English must be the language of any text, or one of dual languages. &quot;All categories of illustrated books for children and young people are eligible.&quot;

CILIP specifies numerous points of artistic style, format, and visual experience, and also &quot;synergy of illustration and text&quot; that should be considered. Furthermore, &quot;The whole work should provide pleasure from a stimulating and satisfying visual experience which leaves a lasting impression. Illustrated work needs to be considered primarily in terms of its graphic elements, and where text exists particular attention should be paid to the synergy between the two.&quot;

== Winners ==
Through 2024 there have been 68 Medals awarded in 69 years, covering 1955 to 2023 publications. No eligible book published in 1955 or 1958 was considered suitable. From 2007 the medals are dated by the year of presentation; previously by the calendar year of British publication.

* Named to the 50th Anniversary Top Ten in 2007.

==Winners of multiple awards==
Only one illustrator, Chris Riddell, has won three Medals. Fourteen other illustrators have won two of the 64 Medals awarded through 2021. The first winner of two Medals was John Burningham, 1963 and 1970. The most recent is Sydney Smith in 2018 and 2021.

Only &quot;A Monster Calls&quot; (Walker Books, 2011), by Patrick Ness and Jim Kay, has won both the Carnegie and Greenaway Medals for writing and illustration (2012).

In 2014, &quot;This is Not My Hat&quot; by Jon Klassen won both the Greenaway Medal and the American Caldecott Medal, which recognises a picture book illustrated by a U.S. citizen or resident. This is the first time the same book has won both medals. The recently common practice of co-publication makes a double win possible. Indeed, &quot;This Is Not My Hat&quot; was released in Britain and America on the same day, 9 October 2012, by Walker Books and its American subsidiary Candlewick Press.

Gail E. Haley was the first illustrator to win both medals, albeit for different works: the 1971 Caldecott for &quot;A Story a Story&quot; (1970) and the 1976 Greenaway for &quot;The Post Office Cat&quot;. She also wrote both books.

Helen Oxenbury, who won the 1969 and 1999 medals, was also a &quot;Highly Commended&quot; runner-up four times from 1989 to 1994; the distinction was used 31 times in 29 years to 2002 and no other illustrator was highly commended more than twice. Michael Foreman, who won the 1982 and 1989 medals, was highly commended once and four times a &quot;Commended&quot; runner-up, a distinction used 68 times in 44 years to 2002.

Walker Books, based in London, with American subsidiary Candlewick Press in Somerville, MA, has published 10 of the 30 Greenaway Medal-winning works from 1985 to 2014.

==50-year &quot;Greenaway of Greenaways&quot; (2007)==
For the 50th medal anniversary, CILIP posted online information about all of the winning works (1955–2005) and conducted a poll to identify the nation&#x27;s favourite Kate Greenaway Medalist. The public were invited to send in their nominations between 16 October and 1 December 2006. Polling was subsequently opened between 20 April and 14 June 2007 for ten shortlisted titles determined by a panel and the winner was announced on 21 June 2007 at the British Library. By less than one percentage point &quot;Dogger&quot;, illustrated and written by Shirley Hughes (1977), outpolled &quot;Each Peach Pear Plum&quot; illustrated by Janet Ahlberg and written by Allan Ahlberg (1978).

The nation, and international voters too, considered a ballot or all-time shortlist comprising ten of the 50 Medal-winning works, selected by six &quot;children&#x27;s book experts&quot;. The panel provided annotations including recommended ages that range from 1+ to 10+ years; age 4+ for the winner.

50th Anniversary Top Ten

Illustrator Harold Jones received a Special Commendation for the 1954 Carnegie Medal, for his part in &quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue: A Book of Nursery Rhymes&quot;, compiled by Kathleen Lines (Oxford) — a 180-page collection named for &quot;Lavender&#x27;s Blue&quot;, which Oxford University Press has reprinted many times. It was &quot;a major reason&quot; for the Library Association to establish the Kate Greenaway Medal that year. No 1955 work was judged worthy in 1956, so the Greenaway was actually inaugurated one year later, recognising a 1956 publication.

===1955 to 1989===

=== 2000s ===
Thanks to a bequest left in 2000 by children’s book and illustration collector, Colin Mears, the winner now receives a cheque for £5000 along with the Greenaway Medal.

The winning book in the year 2000, &quot;I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato&quot; was named one of the top ten Medal-winning works in 2007, and ranked third in public voting from that slate.

In 2001, &quot;Pirate Diary&quot; became the latest &quot;information book&quot; to be cited for the medal and the first since 1975. It was the second in a series of four first-person journals, inaugurated by Richard Platt and Chris Riddell in 1999 (&quot;Castle Diary&quot;) and continued by Platt with another illustrator. Riddell was the third and latest illustrator to be at least commended for the Greenaway for books in a series, following Graham Oakley (Church Mice, 1976 and 1982) and Janet Ahlberg (Jolly Postman, 1986 and 1991).

2002 saw Bob Graham become the first medalist from Australia. Lauren Child was the last &quot;Commended&quot; or &quot;Highly Commended&quot; runner-up; there had been 99 such distinctions over 44 years.

Twenty-six years after her first medal, 2003 marked a second win for Shirley Hughes and &quot;Ella&#x27;s Big Chance&quot; —a retelling of Cinderella. Commendations ceased to be awarded in this year. Since 2003 there have usually been eight books on the shortlist. 

In 2004, Chris Riddell was awarded his second medal, this time for &quot;Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&quot;.&quot; In this year there were only 7 shortlisted books.

&quot;Wolves&quot; by Emily Gravett in its U.S. edition was Gravett&#x27;s first book as author or illustrator, just one year out of college. She won the 49th Greenaway Medal, awarded in its 51st year (2005). Three years later in 2008, when once again there were only 7 shortlisted nominations, Emily Gravett won her second medal for her fourth book, with the cover title &quot;Little Mouse&#x27;s Emily Gravett&#x27;s Big Book of Fears&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
In 2012, Jim Kay and Patrick Ness won both the Greenaway and Carnegie Medals for &quot;A Monster Calls&quot;, the first such double. Prior to this, two illustrators of Carnegie Medal-winning books had been runners-up for the Greenaway, namely Charles Keeping (&quot;The God Beneath the Sea&quot;, 1970) and Michael Foreman (&quot;City of Gold&quot;, 1980).

2014 marked the first time that the same book had won both the Greenaway and Caldecott medals, having won the latter in 2013. The winner, Jon Klassen, the first Greenaway medalist from Canada, was shortlisted for two separate publications. In this year the shortlist comprised only seven nominations as opposed to the usual slate of eight.

In 2016, Chris Riddell became the first triple medalist in the history of the award, having also previously won in 2001 and 2004.

From 2016 to 2018 an additional award, The Amnesty CLIP Honour, was bestowed upon a shortlisted entry in conjunction with Amnesty International for &quot;books that most distinctively illuminate, uphold or celebrate freedoms.&quot; In 2016 &quot;There’s a Bear on My Chair&quot; received the inaugural honour and in 2017 the winner was &quot;The Journey&quot;, illustrated and written by Italian artist Francesca Sanna, which followed a family of refugees. In 2018, Levi Penfold received the honour for his black and white illustrations in &quot;The Song from Somewhere Else&quot;.

In 2018 there were only seven shortlisted nominees as opposed to the usual slate of eight. The winner, Sydney Smith would go on to win again in 2021.

In 2019 the Amnesty CLIP Honour was superseded by the Shadowers&#x27; Choice Award, voted for and awarded by children and young people who shadow the Medals.

In 2020, Australian artist Shaun Tan became first BAME author to win the Greenaway Medal in its 64-year history.

In 2022, &quot;Long Way Down&quot; by Danica Novgorodoff became the first graphic novel to win the medal since Raymond Briggs’ &quot;Father Christmas&quot; in 1973. The 2023 medal also went to a graphic novel. In that year there were only six shortlisted nominees as opposed to the usual slate of eight.

<text>The Associação Académica de Coimbra – Organismo Autónomo de Futebol (AAC-OAF), also referred to as Académica de Coimbra () or simply Académica, is a professional football club based in Coimbra, Portugal.

As of the 2023–24 football season in Portugal, the club competes in the third division of the Portuguese football league system, and hosts home games at the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra which is owned by the local municipal government. Although their main home stadium is Estádio Cidade de Coimbra, Académica have also played at the Estádio Sérgio Conceição at the start of this current season, 23/24.

It also has a futsal department with men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams. The club&#x27;s name derives from the footballing division of the Associação Académica de Coimbra, officially known as the Associação Académica de Coimbra - Secção de Futebol (AAC-SF)&quot;,&quot; which fields its own amateur football teams as a second incarnation starting in 1977 and belongs to the student association of the University of Coimbra like the professional AAC-OAF which is however an autonomous organization inside the student association and owns the entire heritage and historical records formerly belonging to AAC-SF until 1974.

Despite being founded in 1887 as a student organisation, following the merger of &quot;Clube Atlético de Coimbra&quot; (founded in 1861) and &quot;Academia Dramática&quot; (founded in 1837), the football section of the Associação Académica de Coimbra was only established in 1911, making it one of the oldest active clubs in Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. The club have won the Taça de Portugal twice, in 1938–39 and 2011–12. In 1966–67, they achieved their highest position of runner-up in the Primeira Liga table.

==History==

The Associação Académica de Coimbra - Organismo Autónomo de Futebol, hereinafter AAC-OAF, which dates back to 3 November 1887, the date of creation of the Associação Académica de Coimbra (AAC) which is the student association of the University of Coimbra, is the legal and legitimate successor of the extinct Section of Football of the Association Académica de Coimbra (&quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra -&quot; &quot;Secção de Futebol (AAC-SF)&quot;) that, by resolution of 10 June 1974 of the General Assembly of Members of AAC after the events of the Carnation Revolution, was transformed into Clube Académico de Coimbra (CAC). The current name, AAC-OAF, was adopted on the joint initiative of the General Board of Academica de Coimbra (&quot;Direcção-Geral da Associação Académica de Coimbra (DG-AAC)&quot;) and the Board of the Academic Club of Coimbra (Clube Académico de Coimbra (&quot;CAC&quot;)), and it was approved by the General Board of Associação Académica de Coimbra (&quot;DG-AAC&quot;) and by the General Assembly of CAC in 1984. By these statutes, a legally-binding link to the student association AAC and its university, the University of Coimbra (UC), was preserved in favour of AAC-OAF. The &quot;Associação Académica de Coimbra -&quot; &quot;Secção de Futebol (AAC-SF)&quot; amateur football team, which also belongs to the Associação Académica de Coimbra students association (students union) of the University of Coimbra, was reinstated in 1977 operating as a sports section of AAC and has been in operation as a student-only football team, usually playing in the lower, regional non-professional football leagues. The AAC-SF section, the non-professional football team made of students, and the AAC-OAF, the professional and autonomous football club, share the same crest and colors displayed on the clothes or uniforms of their sports players, as well as the same parent organization (which is the students&#x27; union or association Associação Académica de Coimbra that houses several sections for a multitude of other sports operating under the same name and crest as well).

Académica de Coimbra won the 1938–39 Taça de Portugal, the inaugural staging of the competition; they defeated S.L. Benfica 4–3 in the final. In 1966–67, the club finished as Primeira Liga runners-up to Benfica (best-ever finish), and lost the cup final 3–2 after extra time to Vitória de Setúbal. Two years later, a cup-final defeat to Benfica meant that the team competed in Europe for the first time, entering the 1969–70 Cup Winners&#x27; Cup and losing in the quarter-finals to eventual champions Manchester City via a single extra-time goal.

Académica de Coimbra moved frequently between the top two divisions in the years that followed. Under João Alves, they ended a three-year exile by winning promotion in 2001–02 as runners-up to Moreirense FC. Following a decade of almost exclusively bottom-half finishes, the team won its first silverware in 73 years when they took the cup in 2012, Marinho scoring the only goal after four minutes against Sporting CP. This allowed them entry into the group stage of the UEFA Europa League – a first European campaign in 30 years. Eliminated in third place in the group, they managed one win, 2–0 at home to holders Atlético Madrid with a brace from Wilson Eduardo.

A 14-year spell in the top division ended for Académica de Coimbra in 2015–16, when they finished in last place.

On 4 November 2017, in honour of their 130th birthday, they joined the Club of Pioneers, a worldwide network of the oldest continuing football clubs from each country in the world, originally founded by Sheffield FC.

After the 2021-22 Liga Portugal 2 season, the club was relegated for the first time to the third tier of the Portuguese football pyramid.

The Associação Académica de Coimbra - Organismo Autónomo de Futebol filed for insolvency in September 2022. The club had overdue debts of more than 5.6 million euros, of which 1.9 million euros to the state, and had 3.1 million euros in defaults with suppliers and service providers. By June 2023, an intricate creative accounting process had been initiated by Académica de Coimbra O.A.F.&#x27;s administration board to allow its emergence from bankruptcy avoiding the extinction of the football club.

==Grounds==
The home ground it uses is the Estádio Cidade de Coimbra which has a capacity of 29,622 and belongs to the municipality&#x27;s local government authority.

<doc id="624853" wikidata="Q650996" url="?curid=624853" title="Myrmica rubra">
<text>Myrmica rubra, also known as the common red ant or the European fire ant, is a species of ant of the genus &quot;Myrmica&quot;. It is found across Europe and is now invasive in some parts of North America and Asia. It is mainly red in colour, with slightly darker pigmentation on the head. These ants live under stones and fallen trees, and in soil. They are aggressive, often attacking rather than running away, and are equipped with a stinger, though they lack the ability to spray formic acid like the genus &quot;Formica&quot;.

This species is very similar to &quot;M. ruginodis&quot;, but &quot;M. rubra&quot; is the commoner of the two.

The larvae of the butterflies &quot;Phengaris alcon&quot; (Alcon blue) and &quot;P. teleius&quot; (scarce large blue) use &quot;M. rubra&quot; as their primary host.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This is one of the most common and widespread &quot;Myrmica&quot; species of the Palaearctic. It occurs in the region stretching from Portugal to East Siberia (as far as Transbaikalia), and from northern Greece to the forest-tundra zone in the North. It has also been introduced to North America in northwestern and northeastern United States and in western Canada, where it is considered an invasive species.

These ants are very common in Europe and the UK and live in meadows and gardens. They live on a diet of honeydew excreted by aphids and feed on many types of insect and other invertebrates. They will attack any creature that disturbs their nest, but are not as aggressive as the red imported fire ant. They also consume pollen, a phenomenon rarely documented in ants of the temperate zone.

== Identification ==
Workers are yellowish brown in colour, 3.5 to 5.5 mm in length. Have smooth and shiny frontal triangle and subspinal areas; long and slender antennal scapes. Queens are similar to workers with larger thorax to store wing muscles. Typically 5.5 to 7.0 mm in length. While it is still somewhat unknown, it is believed that there is another reproductive morph referred to as microrubra that was formerly believed to be a social parasite of &quot;M. rubra.&quot; These queens are smaller in size more comparable to that of the workers. Males have a darker body colour compared to the queens and workers. They have long projecting hairs on their tibiae and tarsi, this is the easiest way to tell them apart from &quot;M. ruginodis.&quot;

== Behavior ==
This ant&#x27;s colonies have a polygyne form and can include up to one hundred queens per nest. These queens will have gathered together after their nuptial flight, formed a nest and laid their eggs in it. The species is also polydomous, with many nest sites per individual colony. The queens can live up to fifteen years. Nuptial flights take place normally in late July to mid-August in Europe. Hundreds of young queens and males take to the air to mate together. Afterwards, the males die and the queens shed their wings to make a new colony. No nuptial flights have been witnessed yet from this species where it is living in North America, however male-only mating swarms have been recorded in Newfoundland, Canada.

In addition to the regular queens (macrogynes), &quot;M. rubra&quot; also have a microgyne caste. These queens are smaller in size compared to the macrogyne and were previously believed to be a different species of social parasite (M. microrubra). More recent DNA analysis suggest that they share a gene pool with the macrogyne and are therefor not a different species. While the roles of these microgynes are not yet fully understood, they are often found in nests with regular queens and this is believed to be a form of intraspecific parasitism where the microgyne are a social parasite of the larger macrogyne. The microgynes are also known to act as an alternative reproductive morph and found their own colonies.

The ants explore the surrounding area around their nest and look for materials, both plant and animal, to feed their colonies. When they find dead bodies, undertakers pick up the dead bodies and quickly carry them away from their nest up to away. They choose locations randomly, and so this species does not create cemeteries.

<text>Lympstone Commando railway station serves the Lympstone Commando Camp on the Avocet Line, a branch line between Exeter and Exmouth in Devon, England.

Whilst signs on the station platform state that passengers alighting must have business with the Camp, this is no longer true and members of the general public can access the station via a public footpath.

==History==
The station was opened on 3 May 1976 by British Rail. This caused some confusion with the older Lympstone railway station, which was consequently renamed &quot;Lympstone Village&quot;. It was built using cast platform sections recovered from Weston Milton railway station, where the track had been singled and one platform was no longer required.

For many years, troop trains were a feature of its operation about three times each year. The trains were operated with a locomotive at each end, as there is no way to run around a train south of Topsham; the leading locomotive on arrival was dragged back to Exeter Central where it was detached. The trains were considerably longer than the platform and loading the passengers was a slow operation, as they had to make their way through the train from the centre coaches. A similar operation today is difficult to arrange, as the regular timetabled passenger service is much more intensive than in the 1980s.

In November 2020, the platform was extended by to make it long.

==Description==
The station is situated on the banks of the estuary of the River Exe. It consists of a single platform, which is on the left of trains arriving from Exeter.

On 28 May 2010, a section of the Exe Estuary Trail opened between Lympstone and Exton; this runs between the platform and the entrance to the camp. As a result, the public can now access the station, although the sign on the platform continues to state that &quot;persons alighting here must have business with the camp.&quot; The Ministry of Defence have accepted that the station is the property of Network Rail and, as such, they cannot prohibit members of the public from using the station; however, people wishing to take photographs from the platform should inform the guard room at the Commando Training Centre beforehand.

==Services==

Great Western Railway operate all trains serving the station. Trains stop here on a generally hourly basis between and , via ; however, all services call here on Saturdays. 

It is a request stop, meaning that passengers wishing to alight must tell the conductor that they wish to do so and those waiting to join must signal clearly to the driver as the train approaches.

<text>Cyril V. Jackson (5 December 1903 – February 1988) was a South African astronomer, known for discovering 72 asteroids and a number of comets.

He was born in Ossett, Yorkshire in England; his father emigrated to South Africa in 1911. He earned his B.Sc. at the University of the Witwatersrand.

He worked at Union Observatory in Johannesburg from 1928 to 1947 (IAU code 078, previously known as Transvaal Observatory and later known as Republic Observatory).

He served with South African forces in the Second World War, and was mentioned in despatches.

After the war he was director of the &quot;Yale-Columbia Southern Observatory&quot; (YCSO) station in Johannesburg (IAU code 077), which had been established by Yale University in the 1920s. Columbia University subsequently collaborated in that venture and the operation became known as the Yale-Columbia Southern Observatory (YCSO, Inc. was formally created in 1962).

Due to light pollution that observatory had to be shut down in 1951 and he supervised the move of its instrument, a 26-inch refracting telescope, to Mount Stromlo Observatory in Australia (IAU code 414). This Yale-Columbia telescope was given to the Australian National University in July 1963, and was destroyed in the 18 January 2003 firestorm that devastated Mount Stromlo.

Jackson worked at Mount Stromlo from 1957 to 1963. In 1963, Yale reopened its Columbia Southern Observatory at El Leoncito, Argentina (IAU code 808), and he served as its director there until 1966, when he retired. He discovered a number of comets, including the periodic comets 47P/Ashbrook-Jackson and 58P/Jackson-Neujmin. He also discovered 72 asteroids in the earlier part of his career at Union Observatory.

<doc id="624870" wikidata="Q3394612" url="?curid=624870" title="Flower (Sonic Youth song)">
<text>&quot;Flower&quot; is a song by American alternative rock band Sonic Youth. It was originally released as a 12&quot; single (listed as &quot;Flower (Use the Word)&quot;) in 1985 by UK record label Blast First, with &quot;Satan Is Boring&quot; as the B-side. This version was quickly withdrawn at the band&#x27;s request. In January 1986, Blast First and the band&#x27;s American label, Homestead Records, both released &quot;Flower&quot; as a 12&quot; backed by &quot;Halloween&quot;; the first run of the UK edition was on yellow/orange vinyl. Blast First also issued the song as a 7&quot; single in edited form, retitled &quot;Flower (Anti-Fuckword Radio Edit)&quot;, with a backwards version, &quot;Rewolf (Special Natas Mix)&quot;, on the flipside.

&quot;Flower&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Satan Is Boring&quot; were all later included on the Geffen Records CD reissue of Sonic Youth&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot; were recorded and mixed at Radio Tokyo in Venice, California in January 1985. &quot;Satan Is Boring&quot; was a collage of live material recorded at concerts in Rotterdam and Aylesbury in April 1985.

==Cover controversy==
The cover of the January 1986 Blast First 12&quot;, a &quot;smudged black-and-white photocopy of a topless model in a downward-gazing pose&quot; taken from a calendar and previously used in Thurston Moore&#x27;s fanzine &quot;Killer&quot;, caused a major controversy with Blast First&#x27;s distributor, Rough Trade Records. In a section on Blast First from his book &quot;How Soon Is Now?&quot;, Richard King said of the &quot;Flower&quot; cover,The sleeve was a copy-shop approximation of the kind of sleeves Raymond Pettibon was producing for the SST label in California: illustrations of blank-eyed characters of SoCal suburbia inhabiting empty spaces, both physical and mental, that despite their best efforts, consumerism and sex couldn&#x27;t fill. What made sense in the context of the American underground, where such signifiers formed part of the bands&#x27; running commentary on their surroundings, had an equal resonance with Sonic Youth&#x27;s connections with the &quot;Artforum&quot; sensibilities of New York galleries. In the context of Collier Street, it was given short shrift, dismissed as either a piece of New Yorker know-it-all provocation, or the kind of straightforward exploitative misogynist artwork that belonged on a heavy metal album.

==Reception==
In his AllMusic review of &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot;, critic Jason Birchmeier noted the inclusion of the &quot;Flower&quot; material, saying, &quot;Similarly morose, these few songs are perhaps even more out-there than the &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; ones, especially &#x27;Halloween&#x27;, which is a subtle five minutes of creeping guitar tingles accented beautifully by Kim Gordon&#x27;s whispery hallucinations&quot;.

A 2015 reassessment of &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;&#x27;s Zoe Camp noted how &quot;Halloween&quot; and &quot;Flower&quot; fit with the album&#x27;s themes of &quot;sex and power&quot;, saying, &quot;On &#x27;Halloween&#x27;, Gordon struggles to identify just what it is that makes her succumb to a man&#x27;s wiles, finally theorizing &#x27;it’s the devil in me&#x27;: the female sex drive, corrupted&quot;. Camp also said that &quot;Flower&quot; prefigured the riot grrrl movement of the 1990s, claiming that the song &quot;encapsulated the sex-positive sentiments, as well as the noise, of the forthcoming movement...granted, &#x27;Flower&#x27; might scan as slightly hippie-dippy next to Kathleen Hanna’s acerbic prose, but its mangled punk instrumentation and feminist politics set a precedent&quot;.

A retrospective on &quot;Bad Moon Rising&quot; by &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; gave the &quot;Flower&quot; tracks a mixed review, opining that &quot;Flower&quot; and &quot;Satan Is Boring&quot; &quot;amount to very little beyond vocals or drumming overtop of thick, layered distortion&quot;, but praising &quot;Halloween&quot;, saying that Gordon&#x27;s &quot;whispered vocals create a hallucination that is accentuated perfectly with prickling guitar notes and distant-sounding drums&quot;.

==Mudhoney cover==
&quot;Halloween&quot; was covered by Mudhoney for their split single with Sonic Youth, who covered Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot;. &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot; / &quot;Halloween&quot; was released in December 1988 by Sub Pop. Mudhoney&#x27;s cover was later included on re-releases of their debut EP &quot;Superfuzz Bigmuff&quot;.

<text>Gordon Richard James Coventry (25 September 1901 – 7 November 1968) was a former Australian rules footballer who played for Collingwood Football Club in the Victorian Football League (VFL).

Afforded &#x27;Legend&#x27; status in the Australian Football Hall of Fame, Coventry was the first player in VFL history to achieve several significant milestones, including playing 300 career games, kicking 100 goals in a season, winning the leading goalkicker award in five consecutive years, and kicking 1000 career goals. Coventry&#x27;s league total of 1299 career goals served as a competition record for over 60 seasons.

==Early life==
The eighth of the ten children of Henry Coventry (1862–1948) and Jane Henrietta Coventry (1863–1940), née Spencer, Gordon Richard James Coventry—known as &quot;Nuts&quot; to his family (said, by some, due to his having a disproportionately large head as a child)—was born on 25 September 1901 in Diamond Creek, Victoria.

Coventry and his siblings attended the Nillumbik State School (No.1003) at Diamond Creek. While still at school, he began working on his father&#x27;s fruit orchard.

==Football career==

=== Diamond Creek (pre-1920) ===
Coventry played his early football for Diamond Creek Football Club in the new Heidelberg District Football League, a competition which began after World War I, and had quickly established himself as a champion centre half-forward. In 1920, he was invited to train at Collingwood. The three significant officials involved with that invitation, who were anticipating Collingwood&#x27;s need to find a suitable replacement for the at-the-time injured Dick Lee, who was nearing the end of his career, were Ernest William Copeland (1868–1947), John James &quot;Jack&quot; Joyce (1860–1945), and John James &quot;Jack&quot; Peppard (1878–1940). Although Lee had played in Collingwood&#x27;s first eight matches in the 1920 season, he had only scored 17 goals; and, also, due to an injury sustained in the round 9 match against South Melbourne, he missed the next seven matches, returning in the season&#x27;s last home-and-away match in round 18—in the interim, Collingwood tried various permutations of forward lines to cover for the loss of Lee, centred on the selection of Ern Utting (five matches), Tom Wraith (one match), and Tom Drummond (one match) at full-forward over that time.

=== Collingwood (1920–1937) ===
==== First season (1920) ====
Coventry played his first senior game for Collingwood at the age of 18 against St Kilda in round 15, 1920. He played on the half-forward flank, kicked one goal, and although &quot;not particularly impressive … [he] showed that he can kick well&quot;. As one of Collingwood&#x27;s four inexperienced players given a run that day (the others were Les Lobb, Len Ludbrooke, and Roy Outram), Gordon played his second match—again on the half-forward flank—in what was also Lee&#x27;s return match, the last home-and-away round of the season against South Melbourne.

Then, just 18, and in his third match, Gordon played at centre half-forward in the Collingwood team (with Lee at full-forward) that beat Fitzroy 4.17 (41) to 3.5 (23), at a muddy, rain-sodden MCG, in the 1920 semi-final . And then, once more at centre half-forward (with Harry Curtis replacing the injured Lee at full-forward), in the Collingwood team that beat Carlton 12.11 (83) to 8.11 (59) in the 1920 preliminary final on 25 September 1920, his nineteenth birthday. Coventry reprised his role at centre half-forward in the team that lost to Richmond 7.10 (52) to 5.5 (35) in the 1920 grand final, kicking 3 goals in the defeat.

==== A role at half-forward (1921–1922) ====
In 1921, his second VFL season, Coventry was selected in a representative VFL side to play against a combined Bendigo team on 6 August 1921, but did not play due to influenza.

He was unable to play in the last home-and-away rounds of the 1921 season due to his illness, although he was able to resume training.

Unexpectedly, he was selected as a last minute replacement for Mal Seddon, who had declared himself unfit to play on the morning of the match, as a consequence of the injury to his thigh that he had sustained at the preceding Tuesday&#x27;s training session in a collision with Percy Rowe. Coventry played at centre half-forward (kicking 3 goals) in the team that lost to Carlton 9.11 (65) to 7.10 (52) in the 1921 semi-final.

Coventry played the entire 1922 season on one half-forward flank, scoring 42 goals, with his brother, Syd, playing on the other.

==== The switch to full-forward (1923–1935) ====
In 1923, with Lee having retired at the end of the 1922 season, Coventry (by this stage a 34-game veteran) moved to full-forward and was the club&#x27;s leading goal-kicker that season with 36 goals. He soon became one of the league&#x27;s most prolific and consistent goal-kickers. He was Collingwood&#x27;s leading goal-kicker for 16 consecutive years, and the league&#x27;s leading goal-kicker on six occasions (five of which were in consecutive years, 1927–1931). He kicked Collingwood&#x27;s only two goals in the lowest-scores-ever grand final of 1927, with Collingwood, in atrocious conditions, defeating Richmond 2.13 (25) to 1.7 (13). He was the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season (which he did in 1929, 1930, 1933, and 1934), kicked a total of 1299 goals in VFL football, and 100 goals in VFL representative teams. Coventry was made a life member of the Collingwood Football Club in 1932, and was also Collingwood&#x27;s best and fairest player in 1933.

====A shock suspension; retirement (1936–1937)====
Coventry missed Collingwood&#x27;s 1936 VFL grand final victory due to disqualification. It was the only time he had been reported in his entire VFL career. Coventry was found guilty of striking Richmond defender Joe Murdoch in the torrid match against Richmond in round 13, 1936. Coventry had a crop of painful boils on his neck, and when Murdoch repeatedly struck his neck, Coventry retaliated.

Coventry was suspended for eight matches, and Murdoch for four. An appeal by Coventry against the severity of the penalty was unsuccessful. At the time, Coventry announced that he was retiring from VFL football. He later relented, and, having served the eighth and last match of his suspension in the first week of the 1937 season, he played in 19 matches and kicked 72 goals in 1937, his final VFL season.

== Playing style ==
Although a very reliable right-foot kick, Coventry was equally able to use his left foot accurately and effectively when needed – see, for example, his left-foot goal under pressure for Victoria at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the 7 August 1933 match against South Australia during the 1933 ANFC Carnival.

The &quot;broad-backed and sticky-fingered&quot; Coventry did not possess the phenomenal skills of his predecessor at Collingwood, Dick Lee, or the aerial prowess of his successor, Ron Todd, but relied on tremendous strength and a vice-like grip when marking the ball, a combination that made him almost unstoppable once he had front position.
::&quot;Once [Gordon &quot;Nuts&quot;] Coventry gets in front it seems that no defender can get round him.His bulky body and his awkward gait seem to brook no interruption, and he never seems to drop a mark.&quot;

== Records ==

Coventry retired after the 1937 season, the first player to play 300 VFL/AFL games, winning his sixth league leading goal-kicker award, and his 16th consecutive club leading goal-kicker award, a club record and five clear of Australian Football Legend and Collingwood predecessor Dick Lee. Coventry also represented Victoria on 25 occasions for a total of 100 goals.

Coventry played in 31 finals matches in his 18-year career, including the drawn Semi-Final match against Melbourne on 15 September 1928 (the first drawn finals match in VFL history), and 10 grand finals, five of which were won by Collingwood (1927–1930, and 1935). In the 1928 VFL grand final he kicked a league record 9 goals, in a match in which Collingwood beat Richmond 13.18 (96) to 9.9 (63).

He was the first player to kick 100 goals in a VFL season (which he did in 1929, 1930, 1933, and 1934), and he kicked a total of 1299 goals in VFL football: a record that stood for more than six decades until it was broken by Sydney Swans player Tony Lockett in the match against Coventry&#x27;s former club, Collingwood, on 6 June 1999.

His tallies included:
* 9 goals in a Grand Final: against Richmond, in the Grand Final, on 29 September 1928.
**An unbeaten Grand Final record, only equalled on one occasion: by Gary Ablett Sr., against Hawthorn, in the Grand Final, on 30 September 1989.
* 10 goals in a match: against North Melbourne on 24 August 1929, and against Melbourne on 2 September 1933.
* 11 goals in a match: against Footscray on 19 June 1926, against Fitzroy on 28 May 1927, against St Kilda on 11 June 1927, against South Melbourne on 11 May 1929, and against St Kilda on 5 September 1931.
* 14 goals in a match: against Hawthorn on 18 August 1934.
* 15 goals in a match: against Essendon on 8 July 1933.
* 16 goals in a match: against Hawthorn on 27 July 1929.
**This broke the previous league record of 14 goals, set by South Melbourne&#x27;s Harold Robertson ten years earlier in the match against St Kilda on 26 July 1919.
* 17 goals in a match: against Fitzroy on 19 July 1930.
**A league record at the time, Gordon Coventry&#x27;s record score of 17 goals in a single match – 17.4 (106) – has only ever been broken once, by Melbourne&#x27;s Fred Fanning, who kicked 18.1 (109) in his last-ever VFL match against St Kilda on 30 August 1947; and, also, has only ever been equalled once, by Hawthorn&#x27;s Jason Dunstall, who kicked 17.5 (107) against Richmond on 2 May 1992.
* 97 goals in a season: 1927.
* 105 goals in a season: 1934.
* 108 goals in a season: 1933.
* 118 goals in a season: 1930.
* 124 goals in a season: 1929.
**1929 was the first time that any VFL player had scored 100 goals or more in a single season.
== Coaching career ==
After leaving Collingwood, Coventry coached Collegians in the VAFA for a number of years.

==Personal life==
Coventry married Christabel Violet Lawrey on 28 February 1925. They had four children: two sons, George Gordon (b.1925) and Graham (b.1945), and two daughters, Betty Lois (b.1928), later Mrs. Alexander David Denney, and Margaret Shirley (1930–2006), later Mrs. Charles James Banks.

Three of Coventry&#x27;s brothers served in the First AIF: John Thomas &quot;Jack&quot; Coventry, Hugh Norman &quot;Oak&quot; Coventry, who was (posthumously) mentioned in dispatches for &quot;gallant devotion to duty as volunteer stretcher bearer, carrying the wounded&quot; on 9 August 1916, and had been killed in action while serving with the First AIF in Pozieres, and Thomas Coventry, who was wounded in the arm and foot in action in France in 1916.
Another older brother, Sydney Andrew Coventry (1899–1976), also played for Collingwood at the same time as Gordon.

While working as a miner at Queenstown, Tasmania, and playing football for the Miners&#x27; Football Team (as its captain), in Gormanston, Tasmania, in 1920, Syd was approached by St Kilda and invited to play for them in 1921. Syd moved to Victoria, and influenced by Gordon, began training with Collingwood (rather than St Kilda) in the 1921 pre-season; however, in May 1921, &quot;an application by S.A. Coventry for transfer from Miners&#x27; (Tasmania) to Collingwood was refused [by the Victorian Football League Permit Committee]&quot;.

Having served 12 months out of football, Syd was cleared &quot;from Tasmania to Collingwood&quot; on 26 April 1922. He went on play in 227 VFL games for Collingwood (1922–1934) and 27 representative games for the VFL (1922–1934), captain Collingwood for 144 games (1927–1934), win the Brownlow Medal in 1927, and serve for three years as the non-playing coach of Footscray (1935–1937) before returning to Collingwood as an administrator, serving as its vice-president for 11 years (1939–1949), its president for 13 years (1950–1962), and its patron from 1963 until his death in 1976.

==Death==
Coventry died of heart disease on 7 November 1968 at his property in Diamond Creek, survived by his wife and four children.

==Legacy==
In 1996, Coventry was an inaugural inductee of the Australian Football Hall of Fame and was elevated to &quot;Legend&quot; status (as the fourteenth &quot;Legend&quot;) two years later.

In 1998, he was named at full-forward in Collingwood&#x27;s &quot;Team of the Century&quot;.

On 24 November 1999, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

In 2009, &quot;The Australian&quot; nominated Coventry as one of the 25 greatest footballers never to win a Brownlow Medal.

The Gordon Coventry Trophy is awarded to Collingwood&#x27;s leading goalkicker each year. The southern end of the Docklands Stadium is named the &quot;Coventry end&quot;. When the Southern Stand at the MCG was built, a gate/entrance was jointly named after Coventry and brother Syd.

<doc id="624873" wikidata="Q1311946" url="?curid=624873" title="Montgomery, Powys">
<text>Montgomery ( ; translates as &quot;the town of Baldwin&quot;) is a town and community in Powys, Wales. It is the traditional county town of the historic county of Montgomeryshire to which it gives its name, and it is within the Welsh Marches border area. The town centre lies about west of the England–Wales border. Montgomery Castle was started in 1223 and its parish church in 1227. Other locations in the town include The Old Bell Museum, the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path, the Robber&#x27;s Grave and the town wall. The large Iron Age hill fort of Ffridd Faldwyn is sited northwest of the town and west of the Castle.

In the 2011 census, the community of Montgomery had a population of 1,295. The community includes Hen Domen.

==History==
The town was established around a Norman stone castle on a crag on the western edge of the Vale of Montgomery. The castle had been built in the early 13th century to control an important ford over the nearby River Severn and replaced an earlier motte and bailey fortification at Hen Domen, one mile away. An important supporter of King William I (the Conqueror), Roger de Montgomery, originally from Montgomery in the Pays d&#x27;Auge in Normandy, was given this part of the Welsh Marches by William and his name was given to the town surrounding the castle.

The Treaty of Montgomery was signed 29 September 1267 in Montgomeryshire. By this treaty King Henry III of England acknowledged Llywelyn ap Gruffudd as Prince of Wales. Montgomery was sacked at the beginning of the 15th century by the Welsh Prince Owain Glyndŵr. At that time, the castle and surrounding estates were held by the Mortimer family (the hereditary Earls of March) but they came into royal hands when the last Earl of March died in 1425. In 1485, King Richard III was defeated at the Battle of Bosworth and the Royal Estates, including Montgomery and its castle, passed into the hands of the new King, Henry VII, the first Tudor king, and a Welshman. The castle was then given to another powerful Welsh family, the Herberts. One of their descendants, religious poet George Herbert was born in Montgomery in 1593.

During the Civil War, the castle was captured by Parliamentary forces and subsequently slighted (damaged) to remove its military threat.

As a county town, Montgomery prospered, and its buildings give the small town its current character.

In 1923 the Montgomeryshire County War Memorial was completed to commemorate fallen servicemen from Montgomeryshire. The memorial is on a hill about 1 km SW of the town.

==Governance==
Montgomery Town Council represents the community at the local level, with eight town councillors.

Until 2022 Montgomery was also an electoral ward for Powys County Council, electing one county councillor for the ward. Sitting councillor, Stephen Hayes, successfully defended his seat at the May 2017 elections.

As a result of the &quot;Review of Electoral Arrangements - County of Powys&quot; proposals, Montgomery ward was combined with neighbouring Forden, to create a Forden 
and Montgomery ward with a population of over 2,000. This came into effect at the 2022 elections. Green Party candidate, Jeremy Thorpe, won the seat at the 2022 Powys Council election.

== St Nicholas Parish Church==

The parish church was founded in the 1220s, with later additions including late 13th-century chancel and transepts and a 19th-century tower. The church is Grade I listed. Perhaps the most remarkable features of the church are the ornate rood screen, misericords and stalls which were transferred to the church from Chirbury Priory in Shropshire after the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century. The south transept shows evidence of Montgomery&#x27;s close association with the Herbert family. The centrepiece is the Elizabethan era tomb or church monument to Richard Herbert (died 1596) of Montgomery Castle, father of poet and Anglican divine George Herbert. This association is recalled in a memorial poem to a well-known local man J. D. K. Lloyd, who wrote this poem after the style of George Herbert.

This O, 
enclosed around,
smoothe, with no entrance found,
yet soone with newest life to overflow
So has thy tombe, by Pilate sealed,
to us that third day Life revealed,
O grant that I, some morning bright,
my earthly Shell, then broke,
may wear, in White,
Thy Yoke.

Richard&#x27;s grandson, another Richard Herbert, 2nd Baron Herbert of Chirbury, the last Herbert to have lived at Montgomery Castle, was buried in the church in 1655.

==Churchyard and Robber&#x27;s Grave==
In 1821 John Davies of Wrexham was sentenced to death by hanging at Montgomery for highway robbery. Throughout his trial, and after the sentence, Davies declared his innocence and prayed that God would not allow the grass to grow on his grave for a hundred years as a sign of his innocence. His grave remained bare for at least a century, giving birth to the legend of the Robber&#x27;s grave. The grave (now grassed) can still be seen in the churchyard. Besides the legendary Robber&#x27;s Grave, the churchyard also contains the war graves of two soldiers of World War I and a soldier and two airmen of World War II.

==The Town Hall==

The last remaining Georgian town hall in Montgomeryshire, Montgomery Town Hall forms a striking termination to Broad Street, although the centre of the building is offset from the line of the street. Built by William Baker of Audlem, 1748–51, for Henry Herbert, 1st Earl of Powis, for whom Baker had also in 1745 provided designs for a new Town Hall at Bishop&#x27;s Castle. In 1828 Thomas Penson, at the expense of Edward Clive, 1st Earl of Powis, raised the roof level over the first floor. The clock tower was added in 1921. The predecessor of this building was probably a half-timbered structure, which the Speed map of 1610 shows was sited, lengthways, in the middle of Broad Street.

==The Old County Gaol==

The former Montgomeryshire County Gaol that once stood at the end of Gaol Road was designed by Thomas Penson, the county surveyor, and built of brick faced with stone, c 1830–32. The tall octagonal governor&#x27;s house, with the chapel above, was at the centre of four radiating two- and three-storey wings. One of the yards was fitted with a treadmill. The gatehouse was built into the wall to face a new approach in 1866 by J.W. Poundley; powerful ashlar triumphal arch with four giant semi-rusticated pilasters.

The gaol was closed in 1878 and all that now remains, apart from the gatehouse, is the Governor&#x27;s House and the high wall of one cell block.

== Montgomery Primary School ==
Formerly the National School of 1864. The school was built by the architect Thomas Nicholson on land donated by Lord Powis and financed by the then Rector and the Hereford Diocesan Board of Education as well as many smaller gifts. Stone, many-gabled gothic with splay-footed buttresses, well designed and detailed. Master&#x27;s house to left and gabled school building to right, and a wing beyond. The assembly hall was added in 1952 by Herbert Carr, the Montgomeryshire county architect.

The school is under the control of Powys County Council and is an important feature of community life. It remains a Christian school in the diocese of St. Asaph.

==The Old Bell Museum==

The Old Bell Museum is a former 16th-century inn. It has been converted into a museum.

==Sport==
Montgomery Town play in the Ardal Leagues North East division, Tier 3 of the Welsh football pyramid.

==Railways==
The Cambrian Coast Line passes the currently closed Montgomery railway station.

==Culture==
The town was used for many of the filming locations in Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &#x27;A Child&#x27;s Christmas In Wales&#x27; TV adaptation 1987. Notable locations are Broad Street, Church Bank and School Bank.

==Notable people==
*Brothers George Herbert (1593-1633), poet and Anglican divine, Sir Henry Herbert (1594-1673), Master of the Revels, and Thomas Herbert (1597-1642?), naval officer and writer, were all born at Montgomery. Their eldest brother Edward Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Chirbury (1583-1648), poet, philosopher and diplomat, inherited and lived at Montgomery Castle until 1644.
*Geraint Goodwin (1903-1941), author, settled in Montgomery where he died.
*Julie Christie, actress, lived for a long time on the outskirts of the town. She is reported as saying in 2007 that the closest thing she had to home lay in the remembered magic of the few summers she had shared with her mother in Wales when she first returned from India. So she bought a basic farm near Montgomery, invited some friends to stay with her, which is how she has lived most of her life since.

<doc id="624877" wikidata="Q5373344" url="?curid=624877" title="Emmanuel Schools Foundation">
<text>The Emmanuel Schools Foundation (ESF) is a charitable trust which has been involved in education since 1989.

ESF currently run six schools. The four original members of the ESF are: Emmanuel City Technology College in Gateshead (opened 1990), The King&#x27;s Academy in Middlesbrough (2003), Trinity Academy in Thorne, Doncaster (2005) and Bede Academy in Blyth, Northumberland which opened in September 2009. In 2004, the Foundation&#x27;s former chairman, Sir Peter Vardy, discussed an aim to sponsor seven schools in the North of England that would educate a total of 10,000 students. In April 2019, the ESF also formally adopted Joseph Swan Academy in Gateshead into the foundation. Most recently, the foundation adopted Christ&#x27;s College Sunderland (formerly &#x27;Grindon Hall Christian School&#x27;) in Sunderland into ESF.

Many of its schools have been oversubscribed every year.

Although the Government allows academies to select 10% of pupils by ability, ESF Academies do not do so, being fully comprehensive schools for local children. They have a Christian ethos, but are not faith schools and welcome staff and students of all faiths and of none.

==History==

=== Establishment of Emmanuel College ===
In 1988, Sir Peter Vardy responded to the then Government’s appeal to local businessmen to become involved in the education of young people in the most socio-economically deprived parts of their home regions through sponsorship of the City Technology College initiative. The aim of the initiative was twofold:

# To engage business people who had been successful in turning around failing businesses in using their experience to help turn around failing schools, and
# To create beacons of academic excellence in inner-city areas which would be able to show other parents, teachers and students what was possible.

The first ESF school, Emmanuel City Technology College, was founded in 1990 as Tyneside’s City Technology College and opened with just 151 students in Year 7. John Burn (Headteacher of Long Benton) had been instrumental in persuading Peter Vardy to engage in the CTC programme. Originally specialising in Technology, the College was awarded a second specialism in Business and Enterprise (2005), allowing it to build upon its Beacon School and current Leading Edge Status through its extensive work in delivering specialist teaching programmes within Primary Schools.

=== Expansion ===
The foundation was formally established when The King&#x27;s Academy was established in Coulby Newham, Middlesbrough in 2003, as one of the earliest schools built under New Labour&#x27;s academies programme. Vardy pledged to eventually build seven academies.

The Foundation&#x27;s approach was not universally welcomed, and in 2004 opponents blocked the Foundation&#x27;s bid to take over Northcliffe School in Conisbrough, near Doncaster, which Ofsted had placed under special measures. Instead, it took over Thorne Grammar School and redeveloped the site to create Trinity Academy in 2005.

In September 2009 ESF also opened its fourth school, Bede Academy, which is its first covering the whole school age range of 3-18, with Nursery, Primary and Secondary provision across two sites in Blyth on the Northumberland coast. Specialising in Engineering and Enterprise, the school focuses on extending conventional perceptions of engineering by providing specialist insights into aspects of biotechnology, environmental science and recycling technologies, sound and computer network engineering, medical and animal science, and naval and automotive systems and design.

In September 2009 it was announced that David Wootton would join from the Grace Foundation to become ESF&#x27;s first Chief Executive. In February 2010, the Foundation announced that Sir Peter Vardy was to step down as chairman, to be succeeded by his brother, David Vardy, who had previously been Project Director of the foundation, overseeing the building of the schools. The foundation celebrated its twentieth anniversary with a conference at The Sage Gateshead for the staff, including celebratory videos, musical entertainment from each of the schools, and keynote talks by author Gervaise Phinn and futurist Patrick Dixon, among others.

=== New oversight and developments ===
In October 2010 it was announced that Sir Peter Vardy was handing over management of the schools to the United Learning Trust. The ESF schools were never integrated into the ULT network, however, and were ultimately later established as a multi-academy trust (MAT).

In April 2019, ESF formally adopted Joseph Swan Academy in Gateshead, after its being rated inadequate in a 2018 Ofsted inspection, with Emmanuel College vice-principal Mark Hall taking over leadership of the school. Later in 2019, Christ&#x27;s College Sunderland in Sunderland was also brought into the multi-academy trust, with Bede Academy&#x27;s vice-principal Julie Roberts becoming its head.

==Academic successes==

Emmanuel College claims that its students, taught as part of a mixed, non-selective comprehensive school, perform significantly above all value-add measures and their academic results have placed the College amongst the highest ranked schools in England for the past ten years.

A 2009 report on The King&#x27;s Academy by Ofsted referred to many improvements, with the school officially ranked as &quot;good, with many outstanding features&quot;. Inspectors said the academy was exceptional when it came to boosting students&#x27; personal development and well-being, and offering them care, guidance and support.

==Controversy==

In 2002, a group of leading scientists including Richard Dawkins alleged that creationism was taught in biology classes at Emmanuel College. Steven Layfield, the College&#x27;s Head of Science and a Young Earth creationism activist, had held a lecture urging teachers to promote creationism to pupils, parents, and colleagues, including in science classes. Layfield later resigned from the board of creationist body Truth in Science to state a separation between his private views and the school&#x27;s teaching of science.

After reviewing the material used to teach science at Emmanuel College, Mike Tomlinson, chief inspector of Ofsted, decided that the matter did not need to be pursued further. The next Ofsted inspection in 2006 described the school as &#x27;Outstanding&#x27; and found no problem with its science provision.

In 2005, John Harris in &quot;The Guardian&quot; accused Emmanuel Schools Foundation of promoting fundamentalist Christianity.
In 2006, Rod Liddle interviewed ex-pupils for a Channel 4 &quot;Dispatches&quot; programme titled &quot;The New Fundamentalists&quot;, alleging that their teachers had promoted creationism both in and out of class.

However, a later article by Martin Wainwright, writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in December 2006, said that associating ESF&#x27;s schools with creationism &quot;couldn&#x27;t be more wrong.&quot;

Opponents of academies continued to refer to the original accusation. After &quot;Tribune&quot; magazine published such an article in 2009, Peter Vardy took legal action against the magazine and its editor, who apologised, withdrew the allegations, and made an undisclosed payment to a nominated charity.

<doc id="624879" wikidata="Q3308127" url="?curid=624879" title="Corn Pops">
<text>Corn Pops is a puffed grain breakfast cereal made by WK Kellogg Co, described by the company as &quot;crunchy sweetened popped-up corn cereal.&quot; The cereal was introduced in 1950 as &quot;Corn Pops&quot;. In 1951, the name was changed to &quot;Sugar Corn Pops&quot; and later to &quot;Sugar Pops&quot;. It was the sponsor for &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; radio and television show. The name was changed back to &#x27;Sugar Corn Pops&#x27; in 1978, and finally returned to &#x27;Corn Pops&#x27; in 1984, a time when many cereals dropped the word &quot;sugar&quot; from their titles for marketing reasons. In January 2006, the name of the cereal was changed to &#x27;Pops&#x27;, but after a few months of poor reception was changed back to Corn Pops.

In mid-2007, Corn Pops launched its first line extension in many years called &quot;Chocolate Peanut Butter Pops&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Cinnamon Corn Pops&quot; were introduced.

== Overview ==
Corn Pops are made from milled corn. Though the name of the cereal is &#x27;Corn&#x27; Pops, since January 2004, its ingredients have included wheat starch, essentially making the cereal multigrain. By 2007, coconut oil was added to the US ingredients.
The American version features an irregular, flattened, smooth elliptical, shape; Canadian Corn Pops look very different; they are uniformly spherical and have a porous surface, similar to Kix. The taste and texture of the Canadian and American versions of the cereal differ considerably despite sharing the same name and manufacturer. Kellogg&#x27;s says this is due to raw ingredients and the regulatory agencies that exist in a particular country, and that its cereal differs by country also by virtue of marketing and culture. Research is done in different countries to determine preferences, and the formula for the cereal is changed accordingly, affecting the texture, color, and nutrition. The fat, cholesterol, and protein content is the same.

Unlike the vast majority of breakfast cereals, Corn Pops in the USA was packaged in a foil-covered paper bag until the mid-2010s. This helped to prevent the Pops from going stale and from secreting a sticky substance that caused the corn pops to stick together (a problem caused by the method by which the cereal is processed). Honey Smacks, another Kellogg&#x27;s puffed grain cereal, used the same bag Corn Pops used. However, the Canadian version of Corn Pops had long been packaged in a standard plastic cereal bag, now used for American Pops as well.

==Ingredients==

Although the cereal contains partially hydrogenated fats, it is marketed as trans-fat free since the amount of trans fat per serving is less than the threshold 0.5 grams/serving. The cereal also contains monoglycerides and diglycerides, used to bind saturated fat, and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), a preservative.

==Marketing==

===Mascots and spokespeople===
Guy Madison, the star of &quot;The Adventures of Wild Bill Hickok&quot; television show, appeared on the box from 1951 through 1958, occasionally replaced by sidekick Jingles played by Andy Devine. Between 1959 and 1967, the mascot was Woody Woodpecker. The next mascot for the cereal was &quot;Sugar Pop Pete&quot;, a prairie dog dressed as a cowboy with two &quot;six-shooters&quot; with red and white spiral-striped barrels. Pete and the other actors in the commercial sang the jingle: &quot;Oh, the Pops are sweeter and the taste is new. They&#x27;re shot with sugar, through and through... Sugar Pops are tops!&quot; From 1968 to 1977, the mascot was the &quot;Whippersnapper&quot;, a live-action, whip-cracking cowboy. 1979-80 the mascot &quot;Big Yella&quot; was born. A cartoon cowboy in a huge yellow ten-gallon hat, yellow chaps, boots, shirt and vest who tried to trade his collection of giant yellow objects for a bowl of Corn Pops. From 1980 to 1983, a porcupine named &quot;Poppy&quot; represented the cereal. Poppy carried around a yellow suitcase which contained a complete breakfast setting, meeting the by-then industry-standard &quot;part of a complete breakfast&quot; tagline. In early 2009, a live actor dressed up as a Corn Pops puff became the new mascot of Corn Pops. Then, in mid-2009, Kellogg&#x27;s introduced an alternative mascot named the &quot;Sweet Toothasaur&quot;, consisting of the upside down bottom half of an actor&#x27;s face, with a green felt cap with googly eyes and red paper horns on the actor&#x27;s chin.

==Outside the USA==

===Canada and France===

Unlike the American Corn Pops, in Europe and Canada the cereal consists of small, spherical, uniform balls. Both versions are crunchier and have a different taste than the American version.

=== United Kingdom ===
In 1993, Corn Pops were introduced in the United Kingdom but by 2004, they were no longer available. The tagline used in the UK was different: &quot;You can&#x27;t stop a corn popper popping more corn.&quot; Corn Pops sponsored UK boy band Take That&#x27;s 1994 tour, known as &quot;The Pops Tour&quot;.

==Controversies==

Corn Pops attracted attention in 2017 when author Saladin Ahmed observed that the art on the back of the Corn Pops box, which depicted a number of anthropomorphized Corn Pops playing and participating in various activities, featured just one Corn Pop which was brown colored, which was portrayed working as a janitor washing the floor. Ahmed posted his observations to Twitter, where they went viral. Kellogg&#x27;s responded to Ahmed on Twitter apologizing for the artwork, and the artwork was changed for future boxes of the cereal.

<doc id="624882" wikidata="Q314886" url="?curid=624882" title="Jože Plečnik">
<text>Jože Plečnik () (23 January 1872 – 7 January 1957) was a Slovenian architect who had a major impact on the modern architecture of Vienna, Prague and of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, most notably by designing the iconic Triple Bridge and the Slovenian National and University Library building, as well as the embankments along the Ljubljanica River, the Ljubljana Central Market buildings, the Ljubljana cemetery, parks, plazas. His architectural imprint on Ljubljana has been compared to the impact Antoni Gaudí had on Barcelona.
His style is associated with the Vienna Secession style of architecture (a type of Art Nouveau), but he also has influences from the baroque tradition in Slovenia, as well as Byzantine and early eighteenth century Viennese architecture. Plečnik was one of the few notable modernists who did not entirely reject historic forms and ideas, instead paying what he believed to be a debt to history in his designs. Besides in Ljubljana, he worked in Vienna, Belgrade and on Prague Castle. He influenced the avant-garde Czech Cubism. He is also a founding member of the Ljubljana School of Architecture, joining it upon an invitation by Ivan Vurnik, another notable Ljubljana architect.
== Life ==
Plečnik was born in Ljubljana, present-day Slovenia, to Andreas Plečnik, a carpenter from Hotedršica, and to Helena (née Molka) from Ljubljana, and he was baptized &quot;Josef Plečnik&quot;. Plečnik followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, training in woodworking during primary school. This knowledge proved useful in Vienna where he worked for two years as a designer and supervisor making furniture at a woodworking company. As a teenager he was sent to a vocational school, but as a talented draftsman, he then was sent to a technical school in Graz, where he found his first mentor, Léopold Theyer. He studied under noted Viennese architect and educator Otto Wagner and worked in Wagner&#x27;s architecture office until 1900. A woman-friend asked Plečnik to marry her written in a letter. He replied, &quot;I am already married to my architecture.&quot;

== Early work ==

From 1900 through 1910, while practicing in the Wagner&#x27;s office in Vienna, he designed the Langer House (1900) and the Zacherlhaus (1903–1905). The Zacherlhaus was notable for its use of reinforced concrete columns in the ground floor and mezzanine. This practice was considered risky at the time as the practice was fairly new. His use of reinforced concrete columns continued in his later project, The Church of the Holy Spirit.
His 1910–1913 &quot;Church of the Holy Spirit&quot; (Heilig-Geist-Kirche) is remarkable for its innovative use of poured-in-place concrete as both structure and exterior surface, and also for its abstracted classical form language. Most radical is the church&#x27;s crypt, with its slender concrete columns and angular, cubist capitals and bases.
In 1911, Plečnik moved to Prague, where he taught at the college of arts and crafts. The first president of the new Czechoslovak Republic from 1918 onwards, Tomáš Masaryk, appointed Plečnik chief architect for the 1920 renovation of Prague Castle. From 1920 until 1934 Plečnik completed a wide range of projects at the castle, including renovation of gardens and courtyards, the design and installation of monuments and sculptures, and the design of numerous new interior spaces, including the Plečnik Hall completed in 1930, which features three levels of abstracted Doric colonnades. His final work in Prague was the Church of the Most Sacred Heart of Our Lord (Roman Catholic, 1929–32).
Upon the 1921 establishment of the Ljubljana School of Architecture in his hometown of Ljubljana, he was invited by the fellow Slovenian architect Ivan Vurnik to become a founding faculty member and moved to teach architecture at the University of Ljubljana. Plečnik remained in Ljubljana until his death, and it is there that his influence as an architect is most noticeable.
== Ljubljana ==
Plečnik gave the capital of Slovenia, the city of Ljubljana, its modern identity by designing iconic buildings such as the Slovenian National and University Library building. Plečnik was also a transformative figure in the city planning of Ljubljana. This included restorations and improvements to historic buildings and sites. His work in city planning differed from many other efforts of the time, as his focus was further from practical problems found in the city, but instead focused on the overall experience of Ljubljana. He also designed other notable buildings, including the Vzajemna Insurance Company Offices, and contributed to many civic improvements. He renovated the city&#x27;s bridges and the Ljubljanica River banks, and designed the Ljubljana Central Market buildings, the Ljubljana cemetery, parks, plazas etc. Buildings designed by Plečnik were built by the constructor Matko Curk.
After the World War II Plečnik&#x27;s teaching role at the university was gradually reduced because he was over 70 years old. In 1947, he was invited by Ferdo Kozak, the president of the Slovenian People&#x27;s Assembly to design the new Parliament building. He proposed the Cathedral of Freedom (also known as the Plečnik Parliament), a cylindrical two-story main building, topped by a tall conical dome and surrounded by a massive square colonnade. Probably the most daring Plečnik&#x27;s project, 120 meters high, dubbed The Slovenian Eiffel Tower, was shelved because of the instability at the breakup between Yugoslavia and Cominform in 1948. In 1952, Ljubljana city leaders asked Plečnik to remodel the Križanke monastery into a venue for the Ljubljana Festival, his last big Ljubljana project. Other projects he completed at that time included the renovation of the Prešeren Theater, plus the Plečnik Arcades, stairway and fountain, all in Kranj, the reconstruction of churches, the design of the Pavilion on Brionian Islands (Tito&#x27;s summer state residence), and numerous National Liberation War monuments (in Ljubljana-Trnovo, Vipava, Radeče, Črna na Koroškem, Dolenja vas, Sevnica, Laško, Split, Kraljevo). For his work, he twice received the Prešeren Award, in 1949 and 1952 for his life&#x27;s work. Plečnik died in 1957 and received an official state funeral in Žale, attended by many political, cultural and church leaders.
== Legacy ==
In the 1980s, with postmodernist attention to Plečnik&#x27;s work, the general interest in him has also been revived, after being sidestepped during the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, Plečnik&#x27;s legacy has been commemorated in various ways, most notably in the 1990s on the Slovenian 500 tolar banknote, with the National and University Library of Slovenia depicted on the reverse.
The Cathedral of Freedom project by Plečnik is featured on the Slovenian 10 cent euro coin. &quot;Slovenska akropola&quot; is the title of a 1987 album by the Slovenian industrial music group Laibach. During August 2008, a maquette of the Parliament was featured at the &quot;Project Plečnik&quot; exhibition on the architect&#x27;s life, held at the Council of the European Union building in Brussels, Belgium on the occasion of the Slovenian EU Presidency. The exhibition&#x27;s curator Boris Podrecca described the Parliament as &quot;the most charismatic object&quot; of Plečnik&#x27;s opus.
In addition, on 23 January 2012, to celebrate the 140th anniversary of Plečnik&#x27;s birth, a picture of the Triple Bridge was featured as the official Google logo (Doodle) adaptation in Slovenia.
Plečnik&#x27;s home in Ljubljana houses a museum of his life and work. There are several busts and sculptures of him situated around Ljubljana as reminders of his works and legacy.
In 2021, selected works of Plečnik in Ljubljana and Črna Vas were inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites under the name &quot;The works of Jože Plečnik in Ljubljana – Human Centred Urban Design&quot;.
As of 2024, the bibliography of works by Jože Plečnik and about him in COBISS, the
Slovenian Co-operative Online Bibliographic System included 235 entries.

<doc id="624885" wikidata="Q7692384" url="?curid=624885" title="Technicolour (rock band)">
<text>Technicolour was a Finnish rock band from Helsinki, founded by Jimi Pääkallo and active from 2001 to 2008. All the lyrics to their songs were sung in English.

Jimi and Dingo had been playing in the band Cliché when they decided to start a separate project. Gary, Aki, and Toni joined soon after.

The band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Way Out&quot;, was released in September 2003. The album achieved moderate success. Their second album, &quot;Only Shadows Dance&quot; (2005), outperformed the first one, peaking at 11th place on the album chart that year. The album&#x27;s singles &quot;All My Life&quot; and &quot;Teach Me Love (I&#x27;m in Denial)&quot; also ranked among the top ten on radio playlists. With their third album &quot;People&quot;, released in October 2006, Technicolour&#x27;s popularity waned again.

In May 2008, the band announced that they would go on hiatus, and in October of the same year they officially broke up.

Tecnicolour&#x27;s band members have continued playing music in other projects. Vocalist Jimi Pääkallo launched a solo career under the name Jimi Constantine, Gary focused his efforts on the band Monday, which he had started in 2004, and Toni plays with the bands Kardia and The Closed.

<doc id="624890" wikidata="Q3967056" url="?curid=624890" title="Sport in San Marino">
<text>San Marino is a country in Europe enclaved by Italy.

== Football ==

San Marino, along with Italy, enjoys football (soccer) as its most popular sport.

=== Domestic Football ===

The San Marino Championship, founded under the auspices of the FSGC (San Marino Football Federation), is the premier footballing competition in San Marino. The fifteen teams that take part in the competition are split into two groups of eight and seven teams. The top three from each section at the end of the regular season progress into a semi-knockout style Championship Playoff. Prior to 2007, the playoff champion earned a spot in the preliminary rounds of the UEFA Cup. In 2007, UEFA granted San Marino a spot in the 1st Qualifying Round of the Champions League. 2007 league champions S.S. Murata was the first team to represent San Marino in the Champions League when they participated in the 2007-08 competition, losing to Finland&#x27;s Tampere team. San Marino also has a representative in the Italian system, with San Marino Calcio playing in the fourth tier of Italian football, Serie D. San Marino play their home matches in the Sanmarinese at the Stadio Olimpico of Serravalle.

=== International Football ===

The San Marino national team played its first unofficial international match in 1986, in which it suffered a 0–1 defeat to the Canadian Olympic team. Its first competitive outing was on 14 November 1990, a 0–4 loss against Switzerland in the European Championship qualifier. These defeats set the tone for most of the following outings of the team, who are regarded as whipping boys in the qualifying sections of the European Championship and the World Cup, calling into question the merits of San Marino and the other &#x27;microstate&#x27; teams (Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Malta) being included in the main qualifying groups for said tournaments.

They had a brief moment of glory when they faced England in a World Cup qualifier on 17 November 1993, and took the lead through Davide Gualtieri after just 8.3 seconds - still the fastest goal in World Cup competition. Despite this goal, only San Marino&#x27;s third at international level, the microstate went on to lose 7–1.

Until recently, San Marino&#x27;s international record was one of almost total failure, with famous draws against Turkey and Latvia being the only partial successes in an international career that contains over 70 defeats. However, on 29 April 2004, San Marino recorded their first ever win, with a 1–0 victory over Liechtenstein in an international friendly. Andy Selva scored the only goal in a close game that finally gave this tiny republic a footballing victory.

On 6 September 2006, San Marino suffered their biggest ever defeat, losing 13–0 to world giants Germany in the Stadio Olimpico. It was also the largest goal margin defeat in European Championship Qualifying history.
In the same competition on 7 February 2007, they came within 8 seconds of the best result in their history. They were level at 1–1 with the Republic of Ireland after 94 minutes when Stephen Ireland scored within 8 seconds of the final whistle. The goal scored by San Marino was their European Qualifying first goal since losing 4–1 to Austria in 1998.

As of August 2021, San Marino is 210th in the FIFA world rankings - almost last place with 805 points (the bottom is The Turks and Caicos Islands.) 

The most notable Sanmarinese footballer was Massimo Bonini, a midfielder, who played for the national team, but most notably for Italy&#x27;s Juventus FC from 1981 to 1988.

In 2020 San Marino made it through a round for the first time in a UEFA competition making it to the playoffs of the 2022 Futsal EURO. 

In the 2024 UEFA Nations League Group D, Not only did San Marino achieve its first competitive win against Lichtenstein. They went top of their Group to get promoted to the Nations League Group C for the first time in their history. This was an incredible feat for the San Marino national team, and possibly the best the San Marino team have ever performed.

==Motorsport==

Although named after the Republic, the San Marino Grand Prix of Formula One was actually held at the Autodromo Enzo e Dino Ferrari in the Italian town of Imola, about northwest of San Marino, along the Via Emilia. It was removed from the sport&#x27;s calendar in 2007 due to no negotiations to renew the contract with the event organizers. This Grand Prix became etched in infamy after two fatal accidents occurred in 1994, when rookie Roland Ratzenberger and three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna were killed while competing.

San Marino motorcycle Grand Prix has been held during the years in Imola, Misano and Mugello. Currently, Misano hosts both the Grand Prix and the World Superbike Race. Sammarinese Manuel Poggiali won two World Championship titles: 125cc in 2001 and 250cc in 2003. Alex de Angelis has won one 250cc race and was riding in the Moto2 and MotoE classes until retiring in 2020. He is the last Sammarinese rider to appear on a grand prix weekend.

Since 2006, from San Marino starts the FIA Alternative Energies Cup event Ecorally San Marino - Città del Vaticano, organized by the &quot;Automobile Club San Marino&quot;.

==Baseball==
San Marino has a professional domestic baseball team, T &amp; A San Marino, which play in the top division of Italian professional baseball, the Serie A1. It has participated in the European Cup tournament for the top European professional baseball teams several times, hosting the event in 1996, 2000 and 2004, 2007 and in 2016 where it co-hosted along with Italy. It won the championship in 2006, 2008 and 2014. It has also more recently achieved 3rd place in the 2017 Regensburg tournament in Germany. Baseball is generally regarded as one of San Marino&#x27;s more successful sporting fronts when compared to the state&#x27;s performance in other sports.

==Basketball==
San Marino also has a vibrant basketball scene. San Marino Basketball Federation (Italian: Federazione Sammarinese Pallacanestro) is the governing body of basketball in San Marino. It was founded in 1968. It organizes the internal league and runs the San Marino national basketball team. There is also an annual international basketball tournament held every summer called San Marino Basketball Cup.

==Volleyball==
San Marino Volleyball Federation or FSPAV (Italian: Federazione Sammarinese Pallavolo) is the governing body of volleyball and beach volleyball in San Marino. It was formed in 1980. It organizes the internal league and runs the San Marino national volleyball team.

==Rugby union==

The San Marino team represents the nation at rugby, and the &quot;Rugby Club San Marino&quot; also plays in the Italian leagues.

== Olympic games ==

San Marino have competed at 15 Olympic games since 1960 (with the exception of 1964). The country has won a total of three medals, all at the Tokyo 2020 summer games, where target shooter Alessandra Perilli made San Marino become the smallest sovereign country to win a medal of any color at the games. The country has also appeared at 10 Winter Olympic Games, but have not yet managed to win any medals.

<text>Crispix is a brand of breakfast cereal, introduced by Kellogg&#x27;s in 1983. It was created specifically to compete with Ralston Purina&#x27;s Chex family of cereals, which had about $125 million in annual sales and no significant competition. By 1987, Crispix had sales of about $65 million. 

Its box touts its unique composition of &quot;Crispy rice on one side, crunchy corn on the other.&quot; The cereal itself is in a hexagon shape. The two sides are made in a lattice pattern and connected only at the edges; the center is open. Crispix is kosher/parve.

== Manufacturing process ==
Kellogg&#x27;s has released limited information about manufacturing process that results in Crispix&#x27;s unique puffed hexagon shape. According to Kellogg&#x27;s, corn grits and rice are cooked separately, dried, and then rolled with a grooved roller creating a waffled appearance. The sheets of corn and rice are laid on top of each other, cut into hexagons and toasted in an oven that causes them to puff.

==Flavored versions==
A variation of original Crispix introduced in late 2001 in the US known as Cinnamon Crunch Crispix was described by Kellogg&#x27;s as a &quot;[c]rispy corn and rice cereal with a cinnamon taste.&quot; Cinnamon Crunch Crispix joined a number of cereals discontinued by Kellogg&#x27;s after disappointing sales.

Honey Flavored Crispix have been sold twice in the UK, and twice have been discontinued. In Australia, Crispix is rectangular, yellow and honey-flavored. A chocolate version is sold under the name Coco Pops Chex. 

In some markets, Kellogg&#x27;s owns the rights to the Chex name, and sells products in multiple flavors, including a green onion flavor in South Korea, the result of a marketing stunt in 2004 that asked for public input on the next flavor for the brand.

==Health==
Crispix contains 5g of added sugars and 0g of dietary fiber per serving. The cereal received one and a half stars out of five on the Australian Government&#x27;s health star ratings.

<text>Ząbkowice Śląskie ( ; ) is a town in Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland. It is the seat of Ząbkowice Śląskie County and of a local municipality called Gmina Ząbkowice Śląskie. The town lies approximately south of the regional capital Wrocław. , it had a population of 15,004.

==History==
The town was established in Silesia as &quot;Frankenstein&quot; in the late 13th century by German settlers, during the reign of Henry IV Probus of the Piast dynasty, following the Mongol invasion of Poland. It was founded in the vicinity of the old Polish settlement of Sadlno, through which ran a trade route connecting Silesia and Bohemia. The town was sited on a piece of land that belonged partly to the episcopal lands of Zwrócona and partly to the monastery at Trzebnica. The town was located between the sites of two previously existing towns that had failed to attract enough settlers: Frankenberg (Przyłęk) and Löwenstein (Koziniec), and inherited its German name from both. Its positioning on the so-called &quot;King&#x27;s Road&quot; between Prague and Wrocław, not too far from the commercially important city of Kłodzko, would favour the development of the town. The town received municipal rights around 1280, the first mention of &quot;civitas Frankenstein&quot; is dated 10 January 1287. In 1295, Duke Bolko I the Strict granted the town staple right for salt and lead. At the beginning of the 14th century, the first town hall and the castle were erected. The city remained under rule of the Polish Piast dynasty before it was sold to the Bohemian (Czech) king in 1351.

In 1428, the city was invaded by the Hussites. In 1456, Bohemian king Ladislaus the Posthumous gave the city in hereditary possession to the Czech noble Podiebrad family, to which it belonged until 1569. The city was heavily damaged in 1468, during the Bohemian–Hungarian War, and until 1490 it belonged to the Kingdom of Hungary, before becoming again part of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle and defensive walls were rebuilt. Trade and craft flourished. In the early 17th century, the plague killed about one third of the population, and it has been speculated that the Frankenstein gravediggers scandal at that time may have inspired the Frankenstein story. The Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648) ended the town&#x27;s prosperity. Austrian and Swedish troops marched through the city, which was severely damaged. Afterwards, until the late 19th century, it remained a small town. In 1742 it was annexed by Prussia. In 1826, Fryderyk Chopin travelled through the town.

In 1858, the town burned down and had to be rebuilt. On this occasion, the upper part of the 15th-century leaning tower was reconstructed in a straight manner. The town was a county seat from 1816 to 1945. From 1871 to 1918 it was part of the German Empire. In the final stages of World War II in 1945, a German-conducted death march of thousands of prisoners of several subcamps of the Auschwitz concentration camp passed through the town towards the Gross-Rosen concentration camp, and additionally some prisoners from the Nazi prison in Kłodzko were moved to the town. The town was not destroyed during the war. After Germany&#x27;s defeat, the town again became part of Poland, and was renamed to its historic Polish name &quot;Ząbkowice&quot;, with the addition of the adjective &quot;Śląskie&quot; in 1946. The totality of its population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Ząbkowice Śląskie was repopulated by Poles expelled from former Eastern Poland, annexed by the Soviet Union, as well as those arriving from central Poland.

==Sights==
Ząbkowice Śląskie is often called the Silesian Pisa as it is known for its Leaning Tower (Krzywa Wieża), which is one of the main attractions of the town. However, there are also tourist attractions such as the 13th-century fortifications and the ruins of a 14th-century castle.

<doc id="624896" wikidata="Q3532529" url="?curid=624896" title="The Titfield Thunderbolt">
<text>The Titfield Thunderbolt is a 1953 British comedy film directed by Charles Crichton and starring Stanley Holloway, Naunton Wayne, George Relph and John Gregson. The screenplay concerns a group of villagers trying to keep their branch line operating after British Railways decided to close it. The film was written by T. E. B. Clarke and was inspired by the restoration of the narrow gauge Talyllyn Railway in Wales, the world&#x27;s first heritage railway run by volunteers. &quot;Titfield&quot; is an amalgamation of the names Titsey and Limpsfield, two villages in Surrey near Clarke&#x27;s home at Oxted.

Michael Truman was the producer. The film was produced by Ealing Studios and was the first of its comedies shot in Technicolor.

There was considerable inspiration from the book &quot;Railway Adventure&quot; by established railway book author L. T. C. Rolt, published in 1953. Rolt had acted as honorary manager for the volunteer enthusiasts running the Talyllyn Railway for the two years 1951–52. According to British rail enthusiast and film historian John Huntley&#x27;s book &quot;Railways in the Cinema&quot; (published by Ian Allan in 1969), T. E. B. Clarke actually visited the Talyllyn Railway in 1951 and spent two days learning about the tribulations faced by its volunteers. A number of scenes in the film, such as the emergency resupply of water to the locomotive by buckets from an adjacent stream and passengers being asked to assist in pushing the carriages, were taken from incidents on the Talyllyn Railway recounted in &quot;Railway Adventure&quot;.

==Plot==
The residents of the village of Titfield are shocked to learn that their railway branch line to the town of Mallingford is to be closed. Sam Weech, the local vicar and a railway enthusiast, and Gordon Chesterford, the village squire, decide to take over the line by setting up a company through a Light Railway Order. On securing financial backing from Walter Valentine, a wealthy man with a fondness for daily drinking, the men learn that the Ministry of Transport will allow them a month&#x27;s trial period, after which they must pass an inspection to make the Order permanent. Weech is helped by Chesterford and retired track layer Dan Taylor to run the train and volunteers from the village to operate the station.

Bus operators Alec Pearce and Vernon Crump, who bitterly oppose the idea and wish to set up a bus line between Titfield and Mallingford, attempt to sabotage the plans. Aided by Harry Hawkins, a steam roller operator who hates the railway, Crump and Pearce attempt to block the line on its first run, but the train forces its way through. The next day, they sabotage the line&#x27;s water tower but are thwarted by Weech and the line&#x27;s supportive passengers. After Chesterford refuses to accept a merger offer from them, Crump and Pearce hire Hawkins to help them derail the steam locomotive and passenger coach lent to the villagers by British Railways, the night before the line&#x27;s inspection. Blakeworth, the town clerk of Mallingford, is mistakenly arrested despite trying to stop the attempt, and the villagers become disheartened that their line will now close without any rolling stock and working steam locomotive.

Valentine visits Taylor, who suggests that they borrow a locomotive from Mallingford&#x27;s rail yards. Despite being both drunk, they manage to acquire one, but accidentally crash it after they&#x27;re spotted taking it. Both men are promptly arrested by the police as a result. Meanwhile, Weech is inspired by a picture of the line&#x27;s first locomotive, the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot;, which is now housed in the Mallingford Town Hall museum. Upon securing Blakeworth&#x27;s release, he helps them to acquire the locomotive for the branch line. To complete their new train, the villagers use Taylor&#x27;s home, an old railway carriage body, hastily strapped to a flat wagon. In the morning, Pearce and Crump drive to the village to prepare to take passengers, but are shocked to see the train waiting at the station. Distracted from his driving, Pearce crashes the bus into the police van transporting Valentine and Taylor, and when Crump lets slip that they have been involved in sabotaging the line they are promptly arrested.

With Taylor arrested, Weech takes help from Ollie Matthews, a fellow railway devotee and the Bishop of Wilchester, in running the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; for the inspection run. The train departs Titfield late because the police demand transport to Mallingford for them and the arrested men. Despite a mishap with the coupling, the villagers help the train complete its run to Mallingford. Upon arriving, Weech learns that the line passed every requirement for the Light Railway Order, but barely. In fact, had they been any faster, their application would have been rejected.

Driver Ted Burbidge, fireman Frank Green and guard Harold Alford were not actors but British Railways employees from the Westbury depot, located on the former-Great Western Railway main line from London to Bristol. Originally they were provided only to operate the locomotives employed in the film on location but, when Charles Crichton talked to them and realised they &quot;looked and sounded the part&quot;, they were given speaking roles and duly credited.

When interviewed for an article in &quot;Railway World&quot;, T. E. B. Clarke revealed that he based Mr. Valentine on an elderly gentleman that he remembered in the hotel bar while on a holiday.

==Production==

As related in an article focused on the production published in the March 1953 edition of &quot;The Railway Magazine&quot;, the script requirements called for several weeks&#x27; filming (in 1952) on a suitable single-track railway line passing through attractive scenery, complete with a main line junction, a level crossing, and a pleasant branch line terminus station. Assistance was provided by the Railway Executive in charge of British Railways, and a number of branch lines were examined in pre-production, including the Kelvedon and Tollesbury Light Railway, the Mid-Suffolk Light Railway, the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway and the Lambourn Valley Railway.

Shooting was largely carried out near Bath, Somerset, on the Camerton branch of the Bristol and North Somerset Railway, along the Cam Brook valley between Camerton and . The branch had closed to all traffic on 15 February 1951, but was reopened for filming. Titfield railway station was in reality Monkton Combe railway station, whilst Titfield village was nearby Freshford, with other scenes being shot at the disused Dunkerton Colliery. Mallingford railway station in the closing scene was Bristol Temple Meads railway station. The opening scene shows Midford Viaduct on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, where the branch line passed underneath. The scene of the Squire attempting to overtake Harry Hawkins&#x27; steam roller was filmed in Carlingcott.

The scene where a replacement locomotive is &#x27;stolen&#x27; used a wooden mock-up &#x27;locomotive&#x27; mounted on a lorry chassis: the rubber tyres can (just) be spotted between the locomotive&#x27;s driving wheels. The scene was jointly filmed in the Oxfordshire market town of Woodstock and in Richmond Park, London, but the lead-in scene with the turntable was filmed at Oxford locomotive depot with a real engine. The earlier scene of GWR 1400 Class No. 1401 crashing and getting wrecked as it heads down an embankment used realistic scale models filmed on a set at Ealing Studios.

The &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; itself was represented by an actual antique museum resident, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway locomotive &quot;Lion&quot;, built in 1838 and so at the time 114 years old. It was repainted in a colourful red and green livery to suit the Technicolor process and ran under its own power in the film. In the scene in which the &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; is &quot;rear-ended&quot; by the uncoupled train, the locomotive&#x27;s tender sustained some actual damage, which remains visible beneath the buffer beam to this day. The scene where &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; is removed at night from its museum was filmed in the (now demolished) Imperial Institute building near the Royal Albert Hall in London, but shots were created using a studio-built model for this.

==Release==
The film had its gala premiere at Leicester Square Theatre in London on 5 March 1953, as part of the British Film Academy&#x27;s award ceremony, before going on general release from the 6th. The poster was commissioned by Ealing Studios from the artist Edward Bawden and features the final episode in which the Bishop of Wilchester acts as fireman on the purloined Victorian locomotive.

==Critical reception==
Ealing Studios head Sir Michael Balcon expressed dissatisfaction with the result of the film, believing that it didn&#x27;t quite match up to what had been written in the script. Others too at the time thought that it fell short in comparison to other Ealing comedies. The British Film Institute&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; for April 1953, for example, considered the script &quot;disconcertingly short on wit, and some of its invention seems forced.&quot; The acting, however, was praised by &quot;Variety&quot;.

Decades later it is remembered that though the film was &quot;One of the less popular Ealing Comedies at the time, it is now regarded as more of a classic&quot;. Similarly, Ivan Butler in his &quot;Cinema in Britain&quot; called it &quot;A minor Ealing, perhaps even a little tired towards the evening of their long comedy day, but a very pleasant sunset for all that.&quot; George Perry, in his history of the studios, compared it to &quot;Whisky Galore&quot; and &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; as sharing &quot;the theme of the small group pitted against and universally triumphing over the superior odds of a more powerful opponent.&quot; But, quoting a location report by Hugh Samson of &quot;Picturegoer&quot;, he suggests there was a lack of sympathy for the subject: &quot;Odd point about this railway location: not a single railway enthusiast to be found in the whole crew. T. E. B. Clarke, writer of the script, loathes trains. Producer Michael Truman can&#x27;t get out of them fast enough. And director Crichton – well, you wouldn&#x27;t find him taking engine numbers at Paddington Station.&quot; Again, Charles Barr concurred that &quot;there is no grasp of a living community, or of the relevance of the train to people&#x27;s daily needs.&quot;

==Home media==
&quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; is available on Blu-ray disc with numerous disc extras from Film Movement&#x27;s reissue label Film Movement Classics.

==Stage adaptation==
Performances of Philip Goulding&#x27;s adaptation of the story for theatre began in 1997 and have continued regularly since, largely in a series of local productions. A first national tour took place in 2005, and the script was published in 2008 as &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt: A Play&quot; (Samuel French Ltd).

<text>Anton M.J. &quot;Tom&quot; Gehrels (February 21, 1925 – July 11, 2011) was a Dutch–American astronomer, Professor of Planetary Sciences, and Astronomer at the University of Arizona, Tucson.

== Biography ==

=== Youth and education ===
Gehrels was born at Haarlemmermeer, the Netherlands on February 21, 1925. He was born in bible-belt Netherlands, and was forced to attend church regularly, an act he despised. When he was older he rejoiced when he found out his childhood church had been destroyed. During World War II he was, as a teenager, active in the Dutch Resistance. After he escaped to England, he was sent back by parachute as an organizer for Special Operations Executive SOE committing sabotage against the German forces.

After the war, he attended the University of Leiden where he graduated with a degree in physics and astronomy in 1951. He continued his education at the University of Chicago where he obtained his doctorate in astronomy and astrophysics in 1956 under Professor Gerard P. Kuiper. In 1960, he moved to the University of Arizona along with Gerard Kuiper where he would remain for the next 50 years.

=== Astronomical work ===

Gehrels pioneered the first photometric system of asteroids in the 1950s, and wavelength dependence of polarization of stars and planets in the 1960s, each resulting in an extended sequence of papers in the Astronomical Journal.

He discovered, jointly with the husband and wife team of Cornelis Johannes van Houten and Ingrid van Houten-Groeneveld, over 4000 asteroids, including Apollo asteroids, Amor asteroids, as well as dozens of Trojan asteroids. That was done in a sky survey using the 48-inch Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory and shipping the plates to the two Dutch astronomers at Leiden Observatory, who analyzed them for new asteroids. The trio are jointly credited with several thousand discoveries. Gehrels also discovered a number of comets.

He was Principal Investigator for the Imaging Photopolarimeter experiment on the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 first flybys of Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s.

Gehrels initiated the Space Science Series of textbooks, was General Editor for the first 30 volumes of the University of Arizona Press, and set the style by participating in the editing of six of them. He also initiated the Spacewatch program in 1980 and was its Principal Investigator (PI) for electronic surveying to obtain statistics of asteroids and comets, including near-Earth asteroids. Bob McMillan was co-investigator and manager, and became the PI in 1997.

Gehrels taught an undergraduate course for non-science majors in Tucson in the Fall, and lectured a brief version of that in the Spring at the Physical Research Laboratory in Ahmedabad, India. 
His recent research was on cosmology and evolution of the universe, which was woven in as the guiding thread through these courses. He was the named winner of the 2007 Harold Masursky Award for his outstanding service to planetary science.

Gehrels was requested by the Journal &quot;Nature&quot; to write a review on a book regarding Wernher von Braun, in which he quotes inmates of concentration camp Dora. He has therefore charged that von Braun was there regularly and much in charge, and that von Braun bears greater responsibility and guilt than his official biography would imply. Towards the end of the book review it reads: &quot;Von Braun needs no phony defense, for he was a great man in his own scientific specialization... What is needed is a more sophisticated historical perspective...&quot;.

Tom Gehrels was the husband of Aleida J. Gehrels (née de Stoppelaar) and father of Neil Gehrels, George Gehrels and Jo-Ann Gehrels. He died in Tucson, Arizona. The minor planet 1777 Gehrels was named in his honour. The professional and personal papers of Tom Gehrels are held at the University of Arizona.

<doc id="624899" wikidata="Q4090556" url="?curid=624899" title="Boquillas del Carmen">
<text>Boquillas del Carmen, frequently known simply as Boquillas (), is a village in northern Mexico on the banks of the Rio Grande. It is the northernmost populated place in the municipality of Ocampo, which lies within the Mexican state of Coahuila.

The village lies immediately west of the northern part of the Sierra del Carmen mountain range and at the south-west end of the Rio Grande&#x27;s Boquillas Canyon. Boquillas del Carmen was founded as a mining town in the late 19th-century, after valuable minerals were found in the nearby mountains. Mining ceased in 1919 and the population rapidly declined.

Boquillas del Carmen lies adjacent to the Mexico–United States border and visitors on foot from the United States can enter the village via the Boquillas Port of Entry. Situated just next to Big Bend National Park, tourism is the principal industry in Boquillas. After the September 11 attacks, the United States closed the border and the economy of Boquillas was severely affected and the population fell by nearly 50%. In 2013, the border was re-opened and the economy and population subsequently rebounded. From 2020 to 2021, the crossing was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==History==
===19th century===
Silver was discovered in the Sierra del Carmen in the early 1890s. The arrival of miners led to the establishment of two border camps either side of the Rio Grande: Boquillas in Texas (now Rio Grande Village) and Boquillas del Carmen. In addition to the silver, lead and zinc were also discovered. The mined ore containing these metals was smelted in a small furnace by the banks of the river near Boquillas del Carmen before being 
transported by road to El Paso where it was further processed. The local mining company operated a cable car across the Rio Grande between the two Boquillas. At the height of mining operations, there were between 2,000 and 4,000 people living in Boquillas del Carmen.

===20th century===

Around the turn of the 20th century up to 2000 people lived in Boquillas. The principal employment came from industries relating to the production of lead, silver and fluorite ore from nearby mines. Mining ceased in 1919 and the town&#x27;s population rapidly declined.

Efforts began in the 1930s to create a United States-Mexico International Peace Park in the area, joining Big Bend National Park with the Maderas del Carmen in Coahuila. Boquillas del Carmen would have been at the center of this proposed international peace park, but these efforts have not been realized.

Despite this, Boquillas del Carmen interacted with Big Bend in other ways. Tourism from across the Rio Grande became the main trade. Country music star Robert Earl Keen was known to have frequented Boquillas and released an album in 1994 entitled &quot;Gringo Honeymoon&quot; whose title track is said to be about a day he and a female companion visited the village. During the 2000 census, the town&#x27;s population was calculated as comprising 191 people.

===21st century===

The events of September 11, 2001, dramatically affected Boquillas del Carmen&#x27;s 20th-century way of life. In May 2002, the border crossing from Big Bend National Park to Boquillas was closed indefinitely. By October 2006, only 19 families comprising around 90 to 100 residents remained in Boquillas. Most of the town&#x27;s residents had been forced to move away by the closure of the tourist crossing and destruction of the town&#x27;s traditional economy. At the time of the 2010 census, the town&#x27;s population was recorded as comprising only 110 people.

On January 7, 2011, the US National Park Service announced plans to reopen the crossing using a ferry and a passport control center planned to open in the spring of 2012. After multiple delays, the new Boquillas Port of Entry was finally officially opened on 10 April 2013. The then US Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, played an instrumental role in getting the border crossing re-opened.

The hours of operation currently are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday through Sunday, subject to seasonal changes. Since opening of the border crossing, the town of Boquillas del Carmen has seen substantial growth with the addition of electricity (from solar panels), a new medical care office, and enhancements at the public elementary school. Visitors are allowed to bring one bottle of alcohol back to the U.S. via this entry point. One may not bring tobacco back to the U.S. via this entry point.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the US authorities closed the Boquillas Port of Entry on March 17, 2020. It was reopened in November 2021.

==Economy==
After the end of the mining industry, tourism developed in Boquillas in the 20th century with Jose Falcon&#x27;s restaurant opening in 1973. In the late 1990s, Boquillas was a small town of around 300 residents primarily dependent on the Big Bend tourist trade with visitors crossing the Rio Grande to visit the village&#x27;s bar, restaurant, and taco stands. Children posted adjacent to the village&#x27;s Christian mission sold rocks collected in the desert or from nearby caves. Tourism options included pony and donkey rentals, drinks at Park Bar and overnight stays at a local bed and breakfast known as the Buzzard&#x27;s Roost (since renamed as La Zappolita).

The village continues to generate its income from tourists visiting on foot and in 2018 over 11,000 entered Boquillas from the United States. Local guides offer walking tours of the small village and locally produced handicrafts are on sale. Tours to the Boquillas Canyon, hot springs, archaeological sites and caves in the surrounding area by foot, truck, horse/burro, and canoe are also available.

There are at least two restaurants/bars in the village and several curio shops selling mostly bead craft work.

&quot;Los Diablos&quot;, a firefighting team, lives in Boquillas. They work in the national park where they fight wildfires and sometimes support firefighting efforts in the United States.

==Infrastructure==
In 2015 a solar farm was brought into operation, providing electricity throughout the village.

Apart from the river crossing to Big Bend, Boquillas can be reached by road along Mexican Federal Highway 53. The nearest settlement of any size is Santa Rosa de Múzquiz which is away with a journey time of at least 4 hours on account of the poor road condition.

In 2013, it was noted that there was no mobile phone coverage or internet provision in Boquillas. A single telephone line now comes into the village. When one calls that line, the operator states a specific time at which the caller should call back, promising that the operator will find the person being telephoned and ensure that he/she is at the phone in order to receive the call at the appointed time.

==Demographics==

From 1990 to 2010, the population has never been officially recorded as over 200 and it suffered over a 40% drop over the period. By 2017 the population was estimated to have grown to around 300 people although the 2020 official census recorded a more modest growth to a population of 202 people.

The village has a Roman Catholic church and a small Baptist church (&quot;Boquillas Bautista Iglesia&quot;). In 2010 the religious breakdown of Boquillas del Carmen was:
*Roman Catholic - 59 (53.6%)
*Protestant/Evangelical/Biblical Christians - 44 (40.0%)
*No religion/Atheist - 6 (5.4%)

In 2020 the religious breakdown of was:
*Roman Catholic - 74 (37%)
*Protestant/Evangelical - 84 (42%)
*Other religion - 0 (0%)
*No religion/No religious affiliation - 42 (21%)

<text>A bar examination is an examination administered by the bar association of a jurisdiction that a lawyer must pass in order to be admitted to the bar of that jurisdiction.

==Australia==
Administering bar exams is the responsibility of the bar association in the particular state or territory concerned. Those interested in pursuing a career at the bar must first be admitted as lawyers in the Supreme Court of their home state or territory. This generally requires the completion of legal studies which can take up to 8 years depending on the mode of study, the particular degree being completed and the law school. After completing a law degree, law graduates are then usually required to complete a period of Practical Legal Training (PLT).

During the PLT period, law graduates are provided with further legal education focusing more on the practical or technical aspects of the law, such as court practice, conveyancing and drafting statements of claim. Law graduates are also required to complete a minimum number of days under the supervision of a more senior lawyer.

After the successful completion of practical legal training, law graduates must then apply to be admitted to the Supreme Court in their state or territory. This ceremony is usually held with the chief justice of the state or territory presiding. It is a formal ceremony which also includes taking an oath (or making an affirmation) to uphold the laws of the jurisdiction and results in the person&#x27;s name being recorded on the Roll of Practitioners in that jurisdiction.

Once admitted, those wishing to practise as barristers must contact the relevant bar association to register and sit the bar exam. The frequency and availability of these exams depends on the relevant bar association. Generally, the bar exams focus on three main areas of practice which are relevant to barristers; namely evidence, procedure and ethics. The exams are usually administered during the course of a day and comprise a variety of question types, usually answers are given in essay form. Candidates are informed of their results within a few months and pass rates are very competitive. Passing the bar exam in and of itself does not automatically allow one to practise as a barrister, in many jurisdictions (such as New South Wales) further requirements apply.

=== New South Wales ===

In New South Wales, successful bar exam candidates are required to complete the NSW Bar Association Bar Practice Course (BPC), which despite its name, is a mandatory course required to be taken after passing the bar exam. The BPC consists of lectures, assignments and a significant amount of further reading about court procedure and case law. At the conclusion of the BPC, candidates are then required to appear in a mock trial, often before real judicial officers, and argue their respective case. Once satisfied that the candidate has completed these requirements, the NSW Bar Association then provides each candidate with their practising certificate.

Newly called barristers are referred to as readers for a period of usually one year and are required to have at least one tutor who is barrister with at least seven years of call but is not Senior Counsel. 

The initial practising certificate often contains restrictions on what type of work readers are permitted to do. This may include restrictions such as appearing in court alone, undertaking direct access briefs or any other restriction which the bar association deems appropriate. After the 12-month period and upon completion of further requirements such as civil and criminal reading to the bar associations satisfaction, readers are then provided with an unrestricted practising certificate and are no longer readers but barristers.

==Brazil==
The Order of Attorneys of Brazil (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil), the Brazilian bar association, administers a bar examination nationwide two to three times a year (usually in January, March and September). The exam is divided in two stages – the first consists of 80 multiple choice questions covering all disciplines (Ethics, Human Rights, Philosophy of Law, Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, Civil Law, Consumer Law, Civil Procedure Law, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, Child and Adolescent Act, Labour Law, Labour Procedure Law, Tax Law, Commercial Law, International Law, Environmental Law, Pension Law, Fiscal Law, Election Law). The candidate must score at least 40 questions correctly to proceed to the second part of the exam, which are four essay questions and a drafting project (motion, opinion or claim document) in Civil Law &quot;(including Consumer Law)&quot;, Labour Law, Criminal Law, Administrative Law, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law or Tax Law, and their respective procedures. The Bar examination can be taken on the graduation year. Success in the examination allows one to practice in any court or jurisdiction of the country.

== Canada ==
In Canada, admission to the bar is a matter of provincial or territorial jurisdiction. All provinces, except for Québec, follow a common law tradition. Lawyers in every common law province are qualified as both barristers and solicitors, and must pass a Barristers&#x27; Examination and Solicitors&#x27; Examination administered by the Law Society that governs the legal profession in their respective province or territory. The common law provinces all require prospective lawyers to complete a term of articles (usually 10 months) after graduation from law school during which they work under the supervision of a qualified lawyer. The bar exams may be taken after graduation from law school, but before the commencement of articling, or may be taken during or after articling is completed. Once the barristers&#x27; and solicitors&#x27; exams have been passed and the term of articles is successfully completed, students may then be called to the bar and admitted to the legal profession as lawyers (barristers and solicitors).

==China==
==England and Wales==
Since the UK has a separated legal profession, Law graduates in England and Wales can take examinations to qualify as a barrister or a solicitor by either undertaking the Bar Professional Training Course (BPTC) or the Solicitors Qualification Exam (previously the Legal Practice Course (LPC)) respectively. These courses are the vocational part of the training required under the rules of the Bar Standards Board and the Solicitors Regulation Authority and are either undertaken on a full-time basis for one year or on a part-time basis over two years. After successfully completing these courses, which generally include various examinations and practical ability tests, graduates must secure either a training contract (for those who have completed the LPC) or a pupillage (for those who have completed the BPTC). These are akin to articling positions in other jurisdictions and are the final practical stage before being granted full admission to practice. The general timescale therefore to become fully qualified after entering Law School can range between 6–7 years (assuming no repeats are required).

However, some controversy remains about the lack of training contracts and pupillages available to graduates even after having completed the LPC/BPTC. These courses can vary in cost anywhere from £9,000 to £17,000 and are generally undertaken by students on a private basis making them incur additional costs. The final debt in student fees alone after having completed the academic and vocational training can range between £20,000-£25,000. This is set to increase to £40,000-£50,000 for students entering law school.

The &quot;Solicitor Qualifying Examination&quot; (also known as the SQE exam or &quot;super exam&quot;) is the common or single route to qualify as a solicitor in England and Wales. Replacing the Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme in September 2021, this is the only English and Welsh bar examination for solicitors.

==France==

In France, Law graduates must obtain a vocational degree called &quot;certificat d&#x27;aptitude à la profession d&#x27;avocat&quot; (or in everyday speech) in order to practice independently. The most common way to achieve the is by training in an &quot;école d&#x27;avocats&quot; (Lawyer&#x27;s School). This training includes academical and vocational courses and mandatory internships in law firms. Entrance to Lawyer&#x27;s School is obtained by competitive examination.

==Germany==

To become a lawyer in Germany, one has to study law at university for four or five years. Then, one has to pass the First Examination in Law (Erste Juristische Prüfung), which is administered in parts by the Oberlandesgericht (Higher State Court) of the respective state and in parts by the university the person attends; the state part accounts for two thirds of the final grade, the university part for one third. The First Examination is recognised as equivalent to an integrated Master&#x27;s degree. However, it only provides a limited qualification and does not itself permit access to regulated careers in the legal field without further training.

After the First Examination in Law, candidates that wish to fully qualify must participate in a two-year practical training period (Referendariat) including placements at a court of law, a public prosecutor&#x27;s office, a public sector in-house legal team and a law firm (private practice) or private sector in-house legal team. At the end of this training, candidates must take and pass the Second State Examination in Law (Zweites Staatsexamen).

Successful candidates of the Second Examination are called fully qualified lawyer (Volljurist). They may join the bar as an attorney, to become judges and to become state attorneys (public prosecutors). There are some other legal or legal-adjacent careers which require additional or different training (namely public notaries and patent lawyers).

==Ghana==
To become a lawyer in Ghana, one has to study law at any university that offers the Bachelor of Laws degree. After completing the four year law degree, graduates can apply to be enrolled at the Ghana School of Law. Following two years of professional training, successful students can take their bar examination. Upon passing the bar examination, an induction and calling to the bar ceremony is held for all graduating students.

==Hungary==
In Hungary, the Bar Examination is called &quot;Jogi Szakvizsga&quot;, can be translated as &quot;Legal Profession Examination&quot;. To sit for an exam, the candidate needs at least 3 years of daily 8 hours work experience after having a law university degree (masters level). This exam is composed of three parts:
# Criminal Law, Criminal Procedural Law and Law of Criminal Enforcement
# Civil Law, Civil Procedural Law and Business Law
# Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, Labor Law, Social Security Law and Law of the European Union.
After passing these exams the candidate can practice law as a lawyer or as a court secretary, judge, a prosecutor at the public prosecutor&#x27;s office, as a notary public, deputy notary, or an in-house legal counsel etc., and may operate individually at any field of Hungarian law (which also means that they may appear before any Hungarian court without a professional legal representative.).
==India==

The examination conducted is by Bar Council of India. The candidate will be given certificate of practice and will be eligible to practice in any court in India. The exam is conducted in 53 cities of India in national and regional languages. For eligibility, members should hold a law degree from a recognised institute of law approved by the Bar Council of India, registered with their respective State Bar Councils.

==Ireland==
The bar exams in Ireland are the preserve of the Honorable Society of King&#x27;s Inns, which runs a series of fourteen exams over ten weeks, from March to June each year, for those enrolled as students in its one-year Barrister-at-Law degree course. These exams cover such skills as advocacy, research and opinion writing, consulting with clients, negotiation, drafting of legal documents and knowledge of civil and criminal procedure. For those who fail to meet the requisite 50% pass mark, repeats are held in the following August and September.

==Israel==
Israel requires candidates, who had completed their law degree overseas, to hold an Israeli citizenship or permanent residency, and a law degree from an educational institution recognized by the law faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, before being eligible to take the examinations for admittance to the Israel Bar Association. The candidate must pass a battery of examinations for admittance. There is an initial series of examinations in eight separate areas of law: obligations and labor law, property law, family and succession law, criminal law and procedure, civil procedure and professional ethics, constitutional and administration law, commercial law on corporations, partnerships, and other associations, and commercial law on bankruptcy, liquidations, bills, exchange, and tax law. After passing these exams, candidates must serve as an articled clerk for one year, after which they must pass the final examinations, which deal with court procedure, procedure for registering land rights in real estate, procedure for registering corporations, partnerships, and liquidations, interpretation of laws and judicial documents, professional ethics, evidence, and recent changes in case law and legislation. The final examinations consist of a written examination followed by an oral examination in front of three judges.

The for Irish solicitors is known as the Final Examination - First Part (FE-1).

==Iran==
The Bar Exam in Iran is administered by two different and completely separate bodies. One is the Bar Association of every province—all of which are under the auspices of the country&#x27;s syndicate of the bars of the country. The other one is administered by the Judicial System of Iran subject to article 187 of the country&#x27;s economic, social and cultural development plan.

To receive the license to practice as a &quot;First Degree Attorney&quot; in Iran, an applicant should complete a bachelor of law program. The official career path starts after passing the Bar Exam and receiving the title of &quot;Trainee at Law&quot;. The exam is highly competitive and only a certain number of top applicants are admitted annually.

After admission to the bar, an 18-month apprenticeship begins which is highly regulated under the auspices of Bar Syndicate Rules and supervision of an assigned First Degree Attorney. Trainees or apprentices must attend designated courts for designated weeks to hear cases and write case summaries. A logbook signed by the judge on the bench has to certify their weekly attendance. By the end of the eighteenth month, they are eligible to apply to take the Final Bar Exam by submitting their case summaries, the logbook and a research work pre-approved by the Bar. It is noteworthy, however, that during these 18 months, Trainees are eligible to have a limited practice of law under the supervision of their supervising Attorney. This practice does not include Supreme Court eligible cases and certain criminal and civil cases.
Candidates will be tested on Civil law, Civil Procedure, Criminal law, Criminal Procedure, Commercial Law, Notary (including rules pertaining Official Documents, Land &amp; Real Estate registrations and regulations etc.). Each exam takes two days, a day on oral examination in front of a judge or an attorney, and a day of essay examination, in which they will be tested on hypothetical cases submitted to them. Successful applicants will be honoured with the title of &quot;First Degree Attorney&quot;, after they take the oath and can practice in all courts of the country including the Supreme Court. Those who fail must redo the program in full or in part before re-taking the Final Bar Exam.

==Italy==
In Italy, the Bar Examination is called &quot;abilitazione all&#x27;esercizio della professione forense&quot;. To sit for an exam, the candidate needs a 5-year university degree in jurisprudence and 18 months of legal apprenticeship at a law firm with at least 20 court hearings per semester. The State Bar Exam is composed of two parts: a written exam and an oral exam. 
The written exam is composed of three written tests over three seven-hour days. The candidate writes two legal briefs, respectively on contracts and torts (and more generally about civil law), and criminal law, and a third court brief on civil, crime, or administrative law. The candidates who pass the written tests (the pass rates vary from 30% to 50% according to jurisdiction) can sit at an oral exam before a panel of judges, lawyers, and law professors, who interview for about an hour the candidates on six areas of law. Italian lawyers may represent their clients on any Italian criminal, civil, or administrative court, except the Supreme Court of Cassation for which an additional exam after several years of law practice is required.

==Japan==
The bar exams in Japan yield the fewest successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam. With the new format of examinations—even after extensive reforms and a new mandatory duration of graduate school education for a period of two years—the pass rate is only 22%. Since 2014, candidates are allowed to take the examinations within five years before their right to take the exam is revoked and they either have to return to law school, take the preparatory exam or give up totally. It is administered solely by the Ministry of Justice.

==Malaysia==
==Philippines==
The Philippine Bar Examination is administered once every year on the four Sundays of November (September before 2011). It covers eight areas of law: political law, labor law and social legislation, criminal law, civil law, commercial law, taxation law, remedial law, and legal ethics and practical exercises.

==Poland==
In Poland, the bar examination is taken after graduating from a law faculty at a university. It allows a person to undertake practice, the duration of which varies depending on the specialization. After the practical period applicants must pass the exam held by the Professional Chambers with assistance from some members of the Ministry of Justice.

==Singapore==
The Singapore Bar Examination (Part B) is administered once every year, usually over the course of four days. The exam is generally held on the last week of November, and is administered by the Singapore Institute of Legal Education (SILE). The eight practice areas covered in the examination include, Civil Law Practice, Criminal Law Practice, Ethics and Professional Responsibility, Family Law Practice, Real Estate Practice, Insolvency Practice, and two electives to be chosen from a list of elective subjects offered, such as, Mediation, Arbitration, and Intellectual Property. From 2023 the exam will become more stringent and training will be lengthened.

In Singapore, the legal profession is a fused profession, granting the professional qualification of an &#x27;Advocate and Solicitor&#x27; to any successful candidate of the Bar Examinations and its practical requirements. To qualify as a candidate for the Bar Examinations, an aspiring candidate must first be a graduate from a law school or university that is on the approved list of schools mandated by the Ministry of Law. The candidate must have also attained a Second Class Lower or equivalent classification in their law degrees to qualify for the bar exam. 

The three universities based in Singapore offering a Bachelor of Laws degree are, National University of Singapore, Singapore Management University, and Singapore University of Social Sciences. There are presently twenty-seven (27) foreign universities offering an approved Bachelor of Laws degree on the list, hailing from four countries, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States of America.

To be called to the Singaporean Bar, all law graduates must complete the following:
#Sit for, and pass the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B).
#Completed a six-month training contract known as the Practice Training Contract with a local law firm, or practice. 
#Subject to an order from Court, legal trainees who have completed at least three months of their Practice Training Contract, as well as sat for and passed the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B), are able to seek partial admission to the bar. By applying to the Court to be part-called, candidates are granted the right to appear before the Court in specific circumstances.

In addition, all law graduates of non-Singaporean university must complete the following additional requirements:
#Sit for, and pass the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part A). The five subjects which are offered in this exam are, Administrative and Constitutional Law, Company Law, Criminal Law, Evidence, and Land Law. All foreign university graduates are required to pass this exam to prove competence in Singaporean law. Part A of the Bar Examinations are administered by SILE as well. 
#All foreign university graduates are also required to complete an additional six-month training known as the Relevant Legal Training, to prove practical competence with a local law firm, or practice.
#Both the Relevant Legal Training, and the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part A) must be completed by a candidate before said candidate is allowed to commence either their Practice Training Contract, or sit for the Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B).
SILE publishes a Commendation List at the end of February of each year to recognise the top performing candidates with two or more subject distinctions in the annual Singapore Bar Examinations (Part B). The Commendation List is also published annually in the March issue of Singapore Law Gazette. Some notable alumni of the Commendation List include Goh Yihan.

==South Africa==
Lawyers in South Africa are separated as in several other Commonwealth countries, but there is a different naming convention. Attorneys face clients while advocates face the courts. Attorneys may appear in some lower courts.

To be admitted as an attorney, one serves &quot;articles&quot; as a candidate attorney with a practising attorney for two years, and then writes a &quot;board exam&quot; set by the relevant provincial Law Society . The length of articles may be reduced by attending a practical legal training course or performing community service.
Attorneys may additionally qualify as Notaries and Conveyancers, via the Conveyancing and Notarial Practice Examinations; those with technical or scientific training may further qualify as patent attorneys.

The requirements to enter private practice as an advocate (Junior Counsel) are also twofold: one needs to become a member of a Bar Association by undergoing a period of training (pupilage) for one year with a practicing advocate and one also needs to sit an admission examination. On the recommendation of the Bar Councils, an advocate &quot;of proven experience and skill&quot; (at least ten years experience), may be appointed by the President of South Africa as a Senior Counsel (SC; also referred to as a &quot;silk&quot;).

The law regulating admission to practise law (&quot;The Qualifications of Legal Practitioners Amendment Act of 1997&quot;) is being revised.

==South Korea==
Due to the colonial-era influence, South Korea&#x27;s bar exam system closely follows that of Japan&#x27;s. First introduced in 1963, South Korea is phasing out in 2017 its old system that allows anyone to take the exam and undergo mandatory 2-year state-sponsored training that is criticized for generating &quot;고시낭인&quot; or &quot;exam jobless&quot; referring to people who spend many years of their lives preparing for the exam. The new law school system that began in 2009 allows only the graduates of a law school to apply for the bar exam.

==Spain==
In Spain the examination to access the legal profession and legal practice is called State Examination for Access to the Legal Profession.

The evaluation test has a total duration of 4 hours and consists of:

* 50 questions on «Common subjects in the practice of the legal profession».
* 25 questions on «Specific subjects» according to the legal specialty (civil and commercial, criminal, administrative and contentious-administrative, and labor)

==Thailand==
In Thailand, the bar examination is separate from the lawyer licence. To practice law as a lawyer—i.e. to speak in the court—one must pass a lawyer licence examination and does not need to be called to the bar. People take the bar examination to become qualified to take a judge or public prosecutor examination.

To be called to the bar, one must pass the written exams consisting of four parts as follows.
# Civil and commercial law, intellectual property law, and international trade law. 
# Criminal law, employment law, constitution law, administrative law, and tax law.
# Civil procedure law, bankruptcy and business reorganization law, and the system of the court of justice. And
#Criminal procedure law, human rights, and law on the evidence.

Each part has 10 essay questions. The pass mark is 50. The parts 1-2 are usually taken in October and the rest are usually taken in March. One does not need to pass all four parts in one year. After passing all the written exams, there is an oral exam.

Around 10,000 bar students sit the exam each year. In 2013, 1,231 students were called to the bar, 111 of whom did it in only one year.

Quite confusingly with international norms, students called to the bar are referred to as &quot;netibandit&quot; (เนติบัณฑิต), which means Barrister-at-Law in English. The Thai legal profession, however, is a fused one and those with lawyer licenses are able to practice both as barristers and solicitors in the British/Commonwealth sense. Many students called to the bar choose to become judges or public prosecutors instead of lawyers. As the Thai bar examination (administered and awarded by the Thai Bar Association) is separate from the lawyers licensing scheme (administered and awarded by the Lawyers Council of Thailand), this means that judges and public prosecutors belong to a separate licensing organization from lawyers. This is unlike in the US where judges and prosecutors most often come from the ranks of senior lawyers and belong to the same bar.

==United States==

In the United States, bar examinations are administered by agencies of individual states and territories. In almost all U.S. states and territories, the bar examination is one of several requirements for admission to the bar. In most jurisdictions, the examination is two days long and consists of multiple-choice questions, essay questions, and &quot;performance tests&quot; that model certain kinds of legal writing. The National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) creates several component examinations that are used in varying combinations by all but two jurisdictions, sometimes in combination with locally drafted examination components. The main exceptions are Louisiana and Puerto Rico, which follow civil law systems unlike other parts of the United States.

Generally, earning a degree from a law school (or, more rarely, apprenticeship in a law office) is a prerequisite for taking the bar exam. Most law school graduates engage in a regimen of study (called &quot;bar review&quot;) between graduating from law school and sitting for the bar.

<doc id="624906" wikidata="Q5632803" url="?curid=624906" title="HMS Hogue (D74)">
<text>HMS &quot;Hogue&quot; was a of the Royal Navy that was commissioned during the Second World War. She was named after the Battle of La Hogue, fought between the British and French in 1692; the ship&#x27;s badge a chess rook on a field blue, within a chaplet of laurel gold was derived from the arms of Admiral Sir George Rooke who distinguished himself at the battle.

&quot;Hogue&quot; was built at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead during the Second World and launched on 21 April 1944.

==Design and construction==
The Battle-class was developed as a result of operational experience in the early years of the Second World War, which had shown that the Royal Navy&#x27;s existing destroyers had inadequate anti-aircraft protection, and in particular, lacked a modern dual-purpose main gun armament, capable of dealing with both surface targets and air attack, with guns lacking the high elevation mountings necessary to deal with dive bombers. The resulting design was armed with two twin 4.5 inch high-angle gun-turrets of a new design mounted forward and a heavy close-in anti-aircraft armament, with 16 Battle-class destroyers ordered under the 1942 construction programme. Four of these sixteen ships were to be built by Cammell Laird, with &quot;Hogue&quot; and ordered on 27 April 1942.

&quot;Hogue&quot; was long overall, at the waterline and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of normal and at full load. Displacement was standard and full load. Two oil-fired Admiralty 3-drum boilers supplied steam at and to two sets of Parsons single-reduction geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of ( at full load). of fuel oil was carried, giving an endurance of at .

Two twin 4.5 inch (113 mm) Mark IV gun mounts, capable of elevating to 85 degrees, were mounted forward, while a single 4-inch gun was fitted behind the funnel for firing starshell. Close-in anti aircraft consisted of eight Bofors 40 mm guns in four twin stabilised Hazemayer mounts, with two power-operated 2-pounder guns on the bridge wings. Two quadruple 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo-tubes were fitted, while four depth charge launchers and two racks were fitted, with 60 depth charges carried. The ship had a crew of 247 officers and other ranks.

&quot;Hogue&quot;, named after the 1692 Battle of La Hogue, and the third ship of that name to serve with the Royal Navy, was laid down at Cammel Laird&#x27;s Birkenhead shipyard on 6 January 1943, launched on 21 April 1944 and completed on 24 July 1945.

==Service==
&quot;Hogue&quot; was commissioned on 12 July 1945, The ship was assigned to the 19th Destroyer Flotilla of the British Pacific Fleet, but arrived in the Pacific too late to take part in the Second World War. She remained on station with this flotilla until early 1947, being refitted at Hong Kong in September–October 1946. &quot;Hogue&quot; was placed in reserve at Devonport on 22 May 1947.

&quot;Hogue&quot; was refitted and modernised at Devonport dockyard from March to December 1955. &quot;Hogue&quot; returned to service in 1957 with the 1st Destroyer Squadron in the Home and Mediterranean Fleets. In 1957, with sister ships and , &quot;Hogue&quot; patrolled off Cyprus, searching the fishing boats for arms and explosives. &quot;Hogue&quot; in 1958 patrolled the waters around Iceland. She operated against the Icelandic Coast Guard during the First Cod War. In September, it was claimed by Iceland that she had collided with the trawler &quot;Northern Foam&quot; while trying to prevent her being boarded by the &quot;Maria Julia&quot;.

In 1959, &quot;Hogue&quot; almost collided while refuelling with the aircraft carrier in the Bay of Biscay. She was used with the destroyer to depict the destroyer night attacks in the film &quot;Sink the Bismarck!&quot;.

While participating in a night-time exercise with other navies off Ceylon on 25 August, the Indian light cruiser , rammed into &quot;Hogue&quot;, effectively crushing the destroyer&#x27;s bow and folding it level to the side of the ship, killing a sailor and injuring three others. So extensive was the damage that she remained in Singapore until broken up in 1962, having been deemed to be a &quot;Constructive total loss&quot;.

<text>Denbigh ( ; ) is a market town and a community in Denbighshire, Wales. Formerly the county town of the historic county of Denbighshire until 1888, Denbigh&#x27;s Welsh name () translates to &quot;Little Fortress&quot;; a reference to its historic castle. Denbigh lies near the Clwydian Hills.

==History==

Denbigh Castle, together with its town walls, was built in by order of King Edward I. The Burgess Gate, whose twin towers adorn the symbol on Denbigh&#x27;s civic seal, was once the main entrance into the town. The first borough charter was granted to Denbigh in 1290, when the town was still contained within the old town walls. It was the centre of the Marcher Lordship of Denbigh. The town was involved in the revolt of Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294–1295; the castle was captured in the autumn and, on 11 November 1294, a relieving force was defeated by the Welsh rebels. The town was recaptured by Edward I in December. Denbigh was also burnt in 1400 during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr.

During the Wars of the Roses (1455–1487), the town was largely destroyed, subsequently moving from the hilltop to the area of the present town market.

Leicester&#x27;s Church is an unfinished church. In 1579, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, who was also Baron of Denbigh, planned for there to be a cathedral. His intention was to move the status of &quot;city&quot; from neighbouring St Asaph. The project ran out of money and, when Robert Dudley died, it was left as ruins; it is now in the care of Cadw.

In 1643, during the English Civil War, Denbigh became a refuge for a Royalist garrison. Surrendering in 1646, the castle and town walls eventually fell into ruin.

The town grew around the textile industry in the 1600s, hosting specialist glovers, weavers, smiths, shoemakers, saddlers, furriers and tanners. Denbigh has been an important location for the agricultural industry throughout its history.

===Railway===
Denbigh railway station once served the town on the former London and North Western Railway, later part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. 

It was a junction for the Vale of Clwyd Railway line, which lead north to and , and the Mold and Denbigh Junction Railway. The former was closed in 1955, leaving Denbigh on a lengthy branch running from to , via , which subsequently closed in 1962. A southern continuation beyond Ruthin, linking up with the Great Western Railway at , had closed in 1952. 

The station site has been redeveloped since into a small retail park; however, remains of a platform can still be seen beside the road leading to the Home Bargains store, Aldi Supermarket, Screwfix and two charity shops.

===North Wales Hospital===

At one time, the majority of the population sought employment at the North Wales Hospital, which, dating back to the 1840s, cared for people with psychiatric illnesses. The hospital closed in 1995 and has since fallen into disrepair. In October 2008, a special series of episodes of Most Haunted, titled &quot;Village of the Damned&quot;, was broadcast from the North Wales Hospital over 7 days. As of October 2018, the derelict building has passed into the ownership of Denbighshire County Council.

===Futura Cinema===
Denbigh had a town cinema on Love Lane. It opened as the &quot;Scala&quot; in 1928, before being re-branded as the Wedgwood Cinema in the late 1970s. It closed in October 1980, then reopened by Lewis Colwell in 1982 and renamed the &quot;Futura Cinema&quot;. The cinema closed again in the 1990s, but the building remained open as a video rental store. In 1995, Peter Moore reopened the cinema for a short period before being arrested and convicted of the murder of four men. The video rental store closed and the building is now in ruin awaiting redevelopment. Denbigh has no permanent cinema, though Denbigh Film Club regularly operates in Theatr Twm o&#x27;r Nant.

==Population==
The population at the 2001 Census was 8,783, increasing to 8,986 in the 2011 census., reducing in the 2021 census to 8,669. 

==Amenities==

Attractions in the town include Denbigh Library, Denbigh Castle and the castle walls, Cae Dai 1950s museum, Theatr Twm o&#x27;r Nant, medieval parish church St Marcella&#x27;s, and a small shopping complex. Denbigh Boxing Club is located on Middle Lane. Denbigh Community Hospital was established in 1807. Denbigh Town Hall is a Grade II* listed building.

Denbigh Cricket Club is one of the oldest cricket clubs in Wales having been established in 1844. The club plays at the Ystrad Road ground and plays in the North Wales Cricket League. The 1st XI play in the Premier Division having won the Division 1 championship in 2010 with the 2nd XI in Division 3.

For over 50 years, a barrel rolling competition has been held on Boxing Day in the town square.

==Secondary schools==
There are three secondary schools located in Denbigh. Denbigh High School is the larger of the two, consisting of nearly 600 pupils and approximately 60 staff. The current headmaster is Glen Williams.

St Brigid&#x27;s is a Catholic voluntary aided school on Mold Road on the outskirts of the town which caters for pupils between the ages of 3 – 19. There is a strict admissions policy and until 2009 the school only accepted girls. The schools current headteacher is Leah Crimes.

Myddleton College is the former Howell&#x27;s Preparatory School and is an independent co-educational day and boarding school.

All 3 of these High Schools in Denbigh, along with Ysgol Brynhyfryd (Ruthin), Ysgol Glan Clwyd (St Asaph), Denbigh College, and Llysfasi College (Deeside) have joined to offer a combined 6th form under the title &#x27;The Dyffryn Clwyd Consortium&#x27;.

==Site of Special Scientific Interest==
Crest Mawr Wood (&quot;alt. - Crêst&quot;) is a Site of Special Scientific Interest to the north west, adjoining Denbigh Golf Club and the Tarmac Quarry, an historic and ancient deciduous woodland. This woodland is endangered due to environmental pressure and competing land use in the area.

==National Eisteddfodau==
Denbigh hosted the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1882, 1939, 2001 and 2013.

<text>Henry Sheldon Fitch (December 25, 1909 – September 8, 2009) was an American herpetologist.

Fitch was born in Utica, New York. When he was a year old, the family moved to Medford in the Rogue Valley in Oregon. Growing up, he had a keen interest in all the reptiles he could find on his father&#x27;s ranch. He recounts that he especially liked snakes, because &quot;the real bonus was in seeing horrified adults scatter.&quot;

In 1926, he enrolled at the University of Oregon, but switched to UC Berkeley for his graduate work. He obtained his M.A. in 1933 and a Ph.D. in zoology in 1937. From 1938 to 1947, he worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) as a field biologist in the department of pest control, studying rodents such as squirrels, gophers, and kangaroo rats.

He served from 1941 to 1945 in the Medical Corps as an army pharmacist, stationed initially in the United Kingdom, then France, and finally in Germany. In 1946, he married Virginia Ruby Preston, with whom he had three children. In 1948, Fitch accepted a position as Superintendent of the University of Kansas Natural History Reservation and instructor of zoology, where he could again pursue his studies of snakes and lizards. He became assistant professor in 1949 and full professor in 1958.

From 1965 on, he did extensive field work in Costa Rica, Mexico, Ecuador, and the Dominican Republic. In 1976, he took up field work in Nicaragua and succeeded in getting a five-year-plan for &quot;Ctenosaura&quot; conservation, which was instituted in the 1980s. He retired in 1980, but was still an active herpetologist as of 2006, collecting snakes and publishing papers.

On September 8, 2009, he died in the home of his daughter and son-in-law in Stillwater, Oklahoma.

==Taxa named in his honor==
Fitch is commemorated in the scientific name of a snake, &quot;Thamnophis sirtalis fitchi&quot;, a subspecies of the common garter snake; and an anole, &quot;Anolis fitchi&quot;, &quot;Fitch&#x27;s anole.&quot;

<text>Amalie Arena (officially stylized as AMALIE Arena) is a multipurpose arena in Tampa, Florida, United States, that has been used for ice hockey, basketball, arena football, concerts, and other events. It is mainly used as the home for the Tampa Bay Lightning of the National Hockey League.

The building opened in 1996 and was originally known as the Ice Palace. In August 2002, the building&#x27;s naming rights were sold to the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, which became the &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; in January 2012; accordingly, the arena was known as the St. Pete Times Forum (2002–2012) and Tampa Bay Times Forum (2012–2014). In September 2014, the arena was renamed Amalie Arena when the naming rights were transferred to Amalie Oil Company.

==History==

The venue, located in Downtown Tampa&#x27;s Channelside District, was a secondary location chosen after the failure of Tampa Coliseum Inc. to secure funding to construct an arena on Tampa Sports Authority land near Tampa Stadium. The city of Tampa paid $86 million and the Tampa Bay Lightning paid $53 million for the venue&#x27;s construction and infrastructure. It opened in 1996 as the Ice Palace. Its first event was a performance by the Royal Hanneford Circus. The first hockey game was the Lightning hosting the New York Rangers, which the Lightning won 5–2.

The arena, built as a new home for the Lightning, was necessary because of the lack of a major league-sized arena in the Tampa Bay Area. The largest existing arenas in the region that were best shaped for hockey were Bayfront Arena in St. Petersburg, the Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa, and the USF Sun Dome on the campus of the University of South Florida in Tampa. However, all of these were either too small for an NHL team to use long term, as their capacities were only 5,800 for Bayfront Arena and 10,425 for the Expo Hall, or would need to undergo extensive renovations to make space for hockey in the case of the Sun Dome (which after renovations would then only have an estimated capacity in the mid-7,000s for hockey, making it too small as well). Prior to the opening of the Ice Palace, the Lightning spent one season at the Expo Hall, and then moved to the Florida Suncoast Dome, which was renamed the &quot;Thunderdome&quot;, in St. Petersburg in 1993. The Thunderdome, now Tropicana Field, is currently home to Major League Baseball&#x27;s Tampa Bay Rays.

The arena is owned by Hillsborough County and leased to the Tampa Sports Authority. The authority leases the arena back to the Lightning, who operate it. The current lease agreement ties the arena to the Lightning ownership.

Naming rights to the arena were sold to the then &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, the largest local newspaper in the Tampa Bay area. Other entertainment events occasionally held in the Forum include concerts, NBA exhibition games, USF basketball and NCAA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournament games, NCAA Frozen Four games, tennis, professional wrestling, boxing, figure skating, and rodeos (as well as stand-alone bull riding events; the Forum has hosted an event by the PBR&#x27;s premier tour, the Built Ford Tough Series, annually since 1998).

In 2010, the Tampa Bay Times Forum was ranked as the fourth busiest arena in the United States.

A $35 million renovation was scheduled to be completed before the 2012 Republican National Convention. The renovation included a rebuilt grand plaza entrance, elimination of 2 lower-level suites in each corner (8 of current 28 suites) leaving views from the concourse area to the playing area, renovation of each suite, elimination of sections 323 and 324 on the terrace level (574 seats) for a bar and stage area that will feature a new digital theatre organ, more concessions areas on the terrace level, an outdoor deck and party area overlooking outside plaza and facing the downtown skyline, new climate controls that improve both the ice surface and spectator comfort, new lighting, all new padded seats, resurfaced and redecorated concourse, combining Icons and Medallions restaurants into one venue, and updated restrooms.

Also in 2012, the Tampa Bay Times Forum installed a new video display board. The board is billed as the largest of its kind in North America. Its two larger faces measure , while its two smaller faces are . In comparison, the arena&#x27;s old display board measured on all sides.

On September 3, 2014, Lightning owner Jeff Vinik announced the renaming of the Forum to Amalie Arena after coming to an agreement with Amalie Oil Company, a motor oil company based in Tampa.

Also in late 2014, the arena debuted its 1-acre organic vegetable garden to help feed players and fans. Utilizing an outside area in the back devoted to cooling pipes and recycling bins, a deck was built along with 125 hydroponic towers.

==Events==
===NHL===
As home of the Tampa Bay Lightning, Amalie Arena has hosted games in the Stanley Cup Finals, hosting games one, two, five, and seven of the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals, where the Lightning defeated the Calgary Flames four games to three to win their first Stanley Cup. During the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals against the Chicago Blackhawks, the arena was the site of games one, two, and five. Amalie Arena was also the site of games one, two, and five of the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals, where the Lightning defeated the Montreal Canadiens four games to one to win their third Stanley Cup.

In the 2004 and 2021 Finals, the Lightning clinched the Stanley Cup on home ice at Amalie Arena. Games 3, 4 and 6 of the 2022 Stanley Cup Finals were also held at Amalie Arena; the Colorado Avalanche became the first visiting team to hoist the Stanley Cup at the arena after defeating the Lightning four games to two. It did not host the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals as all games were held behind closed doors at Edmonton&#x27;s Rogers Place due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the eventual champion Lightning (who defeated the Dallas Stars in six games) did hold watch parties outside the arena for select season ticket holders. In addition, Amalie Arena has hosted the National Hockey League All-Star Game twice, in 1999 and in 2018.

===College basketball===
In college basketball, the arena is a regular host for games in both the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament and NCAA Division I women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The arena has hosted first and second-round games for the men&#x27;s tournament in 2003, 2008, and 2011 (it was scheduled to host games again in 2020, only to have the tournament cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic). In the women&#x27;s tournament, Amalie Arena has hosted the Final Four of the 2008, 2015, and 2019 tournaments. The arena has also hosted conference tournaments, hosting the 2007 ACC men&#x27;s basketball tournament and the 2009 and 2022 SEC Men&#x27;s Basketball Tournaments. The arena was also the main home of the South Florida Bulls men&#x27;s basketball team for their 2011–12 season while the USF Sun Dome underwent extensive renovations.

Amalie Arena is scheduled to host the 2025 NCAA Division I Women&#x27;s Basketball Final Four and 2026 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball first and second rounds.

===AFL===
During the arena&#x27;s time as home of the Tampa Bay Storm of the Arena Football League, it hosted the league&#x27;s championship game, known as the ArenaBowl, on two occasions, ArenaBowl XII in 1998 and ArenaBowl XVII in 2003.

===Volleyball===
Amalie Arena hosted the NCAA Division I women&#x27;s volleyball tournament Final Four in the 2009 and 2023 tournaments.

===NBA===
The arena was slated to host an NBA preseason game in 2010 between the Orlando Magic and Miami Heat, the league&#x27;s two Florida teams. However, months before the game, the arena&#x27;s basketball floor was treated with an oil-based cleaning solution that resulted in a slippery film forming on it. According to Magic players, the floor was so slippery that they had to walk through their shootaround. When it became apparent that there was no way to make the court playable, the game was canceled half an hour before the scheduled tipoff. All fans received a full refund.

For the 2020–21 NBA season, the Toronto Raptors played their home games in Amalie Arena due to travel restrictions imposed by the Canadian government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada.

===College hockey===
The Frozen Four of the 2012 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey Tournament was held in the arena, hosted by the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the nearest collegiate hockey team to Florida. This was the first time the Frozen Four was held outside the northern US since 1999, when the University of Alaska Anchorage hosted the event at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. Boston College won the national championship game 4–1 against Ferris State. Amalie Arena again hosted the Frozen Four in 2016 and 2023.

===Combat sports===
The arena held its first UFC event on April 16, 2016, for &quot;UFC on Fox: Teixeira vs. Evans&quot;. The UFC returned to the arena for &quot;UFC Fight Night: Joanna vs. Waterson&quot; on October 12, 2019. The UFC returned again for &quot;UFC on ESPN: Covington vs. Buckley&quot; on December 14, 2024.

On December 18, 2021, Amalie Arena hosted the Jake Paul vs. Tyron Woodley II boxing pay-per-view event. Paul won via knockout in round 6. The arena also hosted the Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry boxing event on pay-per-view. Paul won via knockout in round 6.

It has also held the World Wrestling Federation (now renamed to WWE) pay-per-view event Survivor Series (2000), as well as Extreme Rules (2011) and Battleground (2014). Tampa hosted WrestleMania 37 in 2021 but the arena was not involved in the festivities surrounding the event, as all weekly WWE events took place in a bio-secure bubble with zero ticketed fans in attendance called the WWE ThunderDome at the time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. WrestleMania 37 itself was held at Raymond James Stadium in front of a reduced capacity audience over the course of two nights.

On July 20, 2024, Amalie Arena hosted the Jake Paul vs. Mike Perry boxing pay-per-view event. Paul won via knockout in round 6.

<doc id="624913" wikidata="Q11738708" url="?curid=624913" title="Kendray">
<text>Kendray is an area in the S70 postal district of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England that lies between Sheffield Road and Doncaster Road, both of which lead to and from Barnsley town centre. The area takes its name from Kendray Hospital which was named after the linen manufacturer, Francis Kendray. After the First World War building of council houses commenced and the Kendray estate was first established.

From 1983 to 1986 Kendray was one of four areas in South Yorkshire where the Probation Service ran a victim/offender mediation project (one of the first of its kind in the country).

Just under half of the old housing in Kendray has been demolished and replaced with fields, large recreational areas and modern housing. An amphitheatre and playground were built on one of the old sites, and new housing is being constructed on the other remaining sites. There are also plans to build a leisure centre nearby.

Recent regeneration has seen new housing replacing old and unusable housing, turning it into a more modern estate. Continued building is ongoing, as of 2008. Current amenities and services available include a play area in the centre, local shopping, a post office, medical centre, schooling for juniors and a football ground with numerous artificial pitches available.

Barnsley Academy is a secondary school in Kendray taking up to 900 pupils.
The Forest Academy, previously called &quot;Kendray Primary&quot; up until 2013, is also located in Kendray.

Within two miles of Barnsley town centre and easy access to the Trans Pennine Trail and the M1 motorway, Kendray is becoming a popular location for the average family.

== Kendray Initiative ==

This was established to manage the neighbourhood by local residents, the Council and others in 1999.

<doc id="624914" wikidata="Q1368325" url="?curid=624914" title="GNU Aspell">
<text>GNU Aspell, usually called just Aspell, is a free software spell checker designed to replace Ispell. It is the standard spell checker for the GNU operating system. It also compiles for other Unix-like operating systems and Windows. The main program is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL), the documentation under the GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL). Dictionaries for it are available for about 70 languages. The primary maintainer is Kevin Atkinson.

== Comparison to Ispell ==
Unlike Ispell, Aspell can easily check UTF-8 documents without having to use a special dictionary. But the mechanism behind is still 8-bit. Aspell will also do its best to respect the current locale setting. Other advantages over Ispell include support for using multiple dictionaries at once and intelligently handling personal dictionaries when more than one Aspell process is open at once. However, Ispell follows the Unix convention of being a command applied to a file, e.g., , whereas Aspell requires other command-line options, and the &quot;&quot; option is more comprehensive. Sample uses include:
* Interactively run through the checking the spelling ().
* Allow typing a word (followed by newline and ) to find words that sound the same ().

== Windows ports ==
, the latest official Windows port of GNU Aspell was still 32-bit version 0.50.3 (Dec 2002), with dictionaries of similar age. The developer says he has &quot;no time and very little interest in maintaining a Windows port&quot;, and has been looking for somebody to maintain it. However, the LyX project maintains a separate fork of Aspell for Windows and dictionaries, and says &quot;the LyX project has long solved the Windows packaging problem by forking Aspell.&quot; LyX is being maintained and the latest version is 2.3.7, dated 7 January 2023.

The regularly updated Cygwin port of aspell can also be used in Windows and it is the latest version.

== Integration ==
Aspell has been integrated into software such as Gajim, LyX, Notepad++, Claws Mail and previously Pidgin, Opera, gedit and AbiWord.

<text>The Meadowlands Sports Complex is a sports complex located in East Rutherford, New Jersey, United States. The facility is owned and operated by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority (NJSEA). It is named for the New Jersey Meadowlands, upon which it was built.

The complex currently consists of MetLife Stadium, which is home to the New York Giants and New York Jets of the National Football League; the Meadowlands Racetrack, a famous harness racing circuit (which is home of the annual Hambletonian Stakes); and the Quest Diagnostics Training Center, which is the Giants&#x27; practice facility.

The complex is also home to the American Dream retail and entertainment venue, which was home to the Metropolitan Riveters of the Premier Hockey Federation, and the now-closed Meadowlands Arena, which served as a home for the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League, Seton Hall University&#x27;s men&#x27;s basketball team, and the team the arena was built for, the now–Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association.

==History==

In the mid-1960s, civic leaders in New Jersey began calling for a sports complex in the New Jersey Meadowlands that would be able to lure an NFL team from New York City. The New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority Law was passed by the New Jersey Legislature in 1971 and signed by then–Governor of New Jersey William T. Cahill. The first chairman of the NJSEA was David A. &quot;Sonny&quot; Werblin, former president of the NFL&#x27;s New York Jets. By year&#x27;s end, Werblin had secured a deal for the New York Giants, who were then playing in Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, to move to the Meadowlands. Ground was broken on Giants Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack on November 19, 1972.

To accommodate the new facility, access roads were improved. The New Jersey Turnpike, which had been suffering the burden of increased traffic volumes near its northern terminus in Ridgefield Park, built a new alignment, the &quot;western spur&quot;, with an exit, interchange 16W, leading directly to the sports complex as well as to Route 3. Routes 3 and 20 (now 120) also received improvements.

On September 1, 1976, the Meadowlands Racetrack became the first complex venue to open, featuring harness racing. The track drew a capacity crowd of 42,133 for its initial date. Giants Stadium opened on October 10, 1976, as 76,042 fans watched the New York Giants lose to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–14.

By 1977, plans were in the works to expand the complex. A new arena was to be built on the opposite side of Route 20 from the stadium and racetrack, connected by vehicle ramps and a pedestrian bridge. Brendan Byrne Arena, named for the sitting governor, opened July 2, 1981, with the first of six sold-out shows by musician Bruce Springsteen. The arena was renamed for its corporate sponsor, Continental Airlines (now part of United Airlines), as Continental Airlines Arena, in early 1996, since the airline had a hub at nearby Newark Liberty International Airport. It was renamed again in 2007 for Izod as Izod Center. The first tenant in the arena was the New Jersey Nets in 1981. A year later, the New Jersey Devils of the NHL and the Seton Hall University men&#x27;s basketball team joined the Nets.

The Nets played their first game at the arena on October 30, 1981, and lost to their cross-river rivals, the New York Knicks by a score of 103–99. The Devils played their first game on October 5, 1982, against the Pittsburgh Penguins. The game ended in a 3–3 tie.

The New York Jets moved to Giants Stadium on September 6, 1984, after playing at Shea Stadium for nearly 20 years. In their first game at the stadium on that day, the Jets lost 23–17 to the Pittsburgh Steelers in front of 70,564 fans.

In 2007, construction began on a mega-mall, named Meadowlands Xanadu. Work came to a halt in 2009, and Triple Five, owners of the Mall of America, took over the project in 2011. The construction was not complete until 2019.

The New Jersey Devils and Seton Hall Pirates left the complex when the Prudential Center was finished in 2007, followed by the New Jersey Nets, who moved there in 2010 to go to Prudential Center, then Brooklyn two years later, leaving the Izod Center devoid of a main tenant but free to host more concerts and events. Giants Stadium closed in at the end of the 2009 NFL season and demolition started immediately. In September 2010, MetLife Stadium, then known as New Meadowlands Stadium, opened for its first game. It was privately built and funded by the Jets and Giants. A commuter train line and a training center for the Giants also opened at the same time. MetLife bought the naming rights for the stadium and the entire complex in August 2011.

Meadowlands Arena closed in April 2015 to the public after suffering the loss of its major tenants and economic losses from other events. Since then, the arena has been used for concert rehearsals and private video productions. The former arena box offices are used as a station for the NJSEA EMS and the former Winner&#x27;s Club lounge restaurant is the quarters for the New Jersey State Police.

MetLife Stadium will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, including the final; it will be the second time FIFA World Cup matches are played at the Meadowlands. Giants Stadium hosted matches during the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

In addition to the three venues, the complex also hosts events in the MetLife Stadium parking lot. State Fair Meadowlands (formerly called the Meadowlands Fair, and not affiliated with the New Jersey State Fair held annually in Sussex County) began in 1986 and has been operated by State Fair of Belleville since 2003. The parking lot is also the home of a twice-weekly flea market, which is canceled when the parking spaces are needed for stadium events.

The NJSEA hires in-house security and emergency medical services staff to serve the venues at the Sports Complex, including MetLife Stadium. Law enforcement is primarily provided by the New Jersey State Police Sports Complex Unit.

==Venues==

===MetLife Stadium===

MetLife Stadium opened in 2010, following the closing and demolition of the Giants&#x27; and the Jets&#x27; previous home, Giants Stadium. It is the home stadium for the New York Giants and New York Jets of the NFL and is one of two stadiums home to two NFL franchises (SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California is the other). It was the home of the New York Guardians of the XFL, MetLife Stadium hosted Super Bowl XLVIII in 2014 and will host matches during the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

===Meadowlands Arena (former)===
Meadowlands Arena (formerly Brendan Byrne Arena, Continental Airlines Arena and IZOD Center) was a multi-purpose indoor arena. Opened in 1981, it was home to the New Jersey Nets NBA team until 2010, the Seton Hall University men&#x27;s basketball team until 2007 and to the New Jersey Devils of the National Hockey League until 2007. The Devils and the Seton Hall men&#x27;s basketball team moved to the Prudential Center in Newark. The renamed Brooklyn Nets currently play in the Barclays Center. It closed early in April 2015.

===Meadowlands Racetrack===
The Meadowlands Racetrack is a horse racing track that hosts both thoroughbred racing and harness racing. It is known popularly in the region as &quot;The Big M&quot;.

Opened in the mid–1970s, the Meadowlands Racetrack held its first harness race on September 1, 1976 while thoroughbred racing commenced on September 6, 1977. The Racetrack is the site of the Hambletonian, the most prestigious event in standardbred racing. The track is equipped to race at night, when most of its races are.

In the middle of the track is a lake, intended to resemble the state of New Jersey. The Meadowlands Racetrack is also one of the leading simulcast facilities in the world in terms of total handle.

===Quest Diagnostics Training Center===
The Quest Diagnostics Training Center is the main headquarters and practice facility of the New York Giants. It was known as the Timex Performance Center, renamed in July 2013 when the Giants and Quest Diagnostics announced a new partnership after the four-year partnership between the Giants and Timex ended. The facility, on the westernmost portion of the Meadowlands Sports Complex grounds, opened in 2010 and replaced the old Giants&#x27; practice fields and headquarters, adjacent to Giants Stadium. The Giants annually host Training Camp at the facility in the summers, including practices open to the public with fan activities and legend player meet-and-greet opportunities. Parking for Training Camp is in Lot K.

===American Dream ===
American Dream is a large mall and entertainment complex. Formerly known as Xanadu, the project resides within the Meadowlands Sports Complex adjacent to the Izod Center that has over 450 stores. The first of four opening stages occurred on October 25, 2019, with the other stages opening on a staggered schedule on October 1, 2020.

Only 45 percent of American Dream&#x27;s space is devoted to retail locations. The stores will include six anchor retail tenants with more than each, 12 major retailers with each, and 339 smaller shops of up to . It will include more than 100 eateries, as well as a , 18-vendor food court with a kosher food hall.

The other 55 percent of the space contains entertainment facilities. The amusement facilities include or will include an indoor NHL-sized ice rink, an indoor theme park called Nickelodeon Universe, an indoor water park called DreamWorks Water Park, and a concert/performing arts venue with 2,400 to 3,000 seats. Other attractions include the Big SNOW American Dream indoor ski slope, two miniature 18-hole golf courses, a CMX Cine’Bistro dine-in luxury movie theater, a family entertainment center, a bowling alley, a Legoland Discovery Center, a Sea Life Aquarium, an indoor rock climbing facility, and a Mirror Maze attraction. It also includes a kosher food court, with kosher options ranging from ice cream to pizza to fast food chicken.

On September 14, 2022, the Metropolitan Riveters of the Premier Hockey Federation became tenants of The Rink at the American Dream for at least the next three years.

==Access==
===Meadowlands station===
New Jersey Transit operates the Meadowlands station at the complex, the terminus of the Meadowlands Rail Line. In preparation for the opening of the American Dream mall, the station opened for service on July 26, 2009. Studies are also underway about an extension of the Hudson–Bergen Light Rail line to the MetLife Sports Complex. Despite the opening of American Dream in 2019, the rail line is currently not being used daily.

===Road access===
The Meadowlands Sports Complex is primarily surrounded by four main highways: New Jersey Route 3 to the south, Route 17 to the west, Route 120 (also called Paterson Plank Road) to the north, and the New Jersey Turnpike (Interstate 95) to the east. The Turnpike interchanges with Route 3 near the south side of the complex, giving access from that point, and also has a direct southbound exit/northbound entrance at the north side. Route 120 starts at Route 3 near the southeast corner, runs straight through the complex, giving direct exits to certain parking lots east of MetLife Stadium, then turns west to connect back with Route 17, while also giving access from Washington Avenue (CR 503). Routes 3 and 17 also connect to numerous local roads as well. Route 3 also connects to the Garden State Parkway further west, and the Lincoln Tunnel further east, while the Turnpike/I-95 give access to and from the George Washington Bridge northwards, and Newark Airport southwards.

==Auto racing==

In 1983, a Formula One auto race was planned for the New York City area. A temporary street circuit at the Meadowlands Sports Complex was one of the finalists for the location. A course at Flushing Meadows Park, in the New York City borough of Queens, was chosen, but the event was canceled before the first running.

In July 1984, the CART IndyCar series held the first Meadowlands Grand Prix on a temporary circuit built in the Giants Stadium parking lot. The race was only moderately successful, and crowds were mediocre at best. In 1988, the course layout was moved to the streets surrounding Brendan Byrne Arena and redesigned to a , six-turn layout in an effort to improve competition. The race continued until 1991, and crowds continued to stay away.

From 1988 to 1991, the race was part of the Marlboro Million, a cash prize to be awarded to any driver who won the Marlboro Grand Prix, the Marlboro 500, and the Marlboro Challenge All-Star event in the same year. The prize was never won. In 1992, race officials announced plans to move the race to Manhattan, using a street course at the World Trade Center. Within a few months, however, the race was canceled because of cost concerns.

In the early 2000s, conceptual plans were drafted to build a NASCAR-style speedway at the Meadowlands Sports Complex as part of a revitalizing project. However, the plan was rejected and abandoned.

<text>A straight-12 engine or inline-12 engine is a twelve-cylinder piston engine with all twelve cylinders mounted in a straight line along the crankcase.

==Land use==
Due to the very long length of a straight-twelve engine, they are rarely used in automobiles. The first known example is a engine in the 1920 French &quot;Corona&quot; car; however it is not known if any cars were sold. Packard also experimented with an automobile powered by an inline 12 in 1929.

The straight-12 has also been used for large military trucks.

==Marine use==
Some Russian firms built straight-12s for use in ships in the 1960s and 1970s.

MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo 12K98ME and 12S90ME-C and the Wärtsilä-Sulzer RTA96-C are examples of contemporary marine engines in L-12-cylinder configuration. These are popular for propulsion in container ships.

<text>A learning economy is a society that values skills like assets, where learning and employment information is readily exchanged from institution to institution, and controlled by the learner and worker.

== History of knowledge economies ==
Modern economies can be characterised as learning economies in which knowledge is the crucial resource and learning is the most important process. Different kinds of learning and economically relevant types of knowledge can likewise be identified. It is argued that pure market economies, if such existed, would have severe problems in terms of learning and innovation. The &#x27;learning economy&#x27; is a mixed economy in a fundamental sense.

In the public debate, knowledge is increasingly presented as the crucial factor in the development of both society and the economy. In a growing number of publications from the European Commission and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development it is emphasised that citizens of European Union member countries currently operate in ‘a knowledge-based economy’. For several reasons many prefer the term ‘the learning economy’ in characterising the current phase of socio-economic development.

==Active studies==
Academic achievements of learning economy using blockchain appeared in April 2018. In 2018 at the annual United Nations General Assembly, a decentralized &quot;Learning Economy&quot; blockchain protocol was proposed. It asserts that if &quot;education was the new gold standard,&quot; a market economy could be built around it to catalyze and incentivize 21st century education. Blockchain has many applications in education including verifying the integrity of skills, returning the control of identity to the students, and defining research provenance. In April 2019, research was published at Harvard Kennedy School making a case for a new form of Economy Corporation (E-Corp) to govern this decentralized &quot;Learning Economy&quot;.

On January 30, 2020, the state of Colorado&#x27;s Department of Higher Education and the Learning Economy Foundation partnered to provide a three-year empirical study of a statewide decentralized education and workplace ecosystem as a test case for other states and nations. The C-Lab provides a unified space for Web3 pilots and workgroups from across the state of Colorado. Its first goals are learner record interoperability, allowing learning institutions to exchange student records seamlessly, and learner wallets that empower the students to save their credentials on their phones and share them directly with employers and learning institutions. To further this effort, the Colorado Governor&#x27;s Office of Information Technology, CDHE, Learning Economy Foundation, and ETH Denver launched the &quot;Advance Colorado” partnership program powered by the State of Colorado to further blockchain technology initiatives. The goal of the consortium is to lay the foundation for a decentralized and open Internet of Education.

==Early criticism==

Much of the initial theories about the advent of a fundamentally new era in which economic activity is increasingly &#x27;abstract&#x27;, i.e., disconnected from land, labour, and physical capital (machines and industrial infrastructure) and also capital in terms of fund was associated with the &#x27;business management&#x27; literature of the &#x27;new economy&#x27; NASDAQ bubble, which collapsed in 2001 (but slowly recovered, albeit, in a leaner format, throughout the 2000s). This literature was initially known more for its hyperbole and faddishness than for its academic/empirical integrity. More recently [2011] however, empirical research from cross-disciplinary fields such as innovation studies are altering that perception.

Since 2017, the case for decentralized blockchain learning economies has grown stronger along with its criticisms. Many distributed applications have tested economic models that incentivize students and teachers, but without institutional and government support there is little chance of many national learning economies adopting at scale any time soon. Another major concern is new and unknown challenges with student privacy and distributed ledgers, as well as skepticism about the merits of cryptocurrency.

<doc id="624919" wikidata="Q1191195" url="?curid=624919" title="Mold, Flintshire">
<text>Mold ( ) is a town and community in Flintshire, Wales, on the River Alyn. It is the county town and administrative seat of Flintshire County Council, as it was of Clwyd from 1974 to 1996. According to the 2011 UK census, it had a population of 10,058. A 2019 estimate puts it at 10,123.

==Origin of the name==
The original Welsh-language place name, &quot;Yr Wyddgrug&quot;, was recorded as &quot;Gythe Gruc&quot; in a document of 1280–1281, and means &quot;The Mound of the Tomb/Sepulchre&quot;.

The name &quot;Mold&quot; originates from the Norman-French &quot;mont-hault&quot; (&quot;high hill&quot;). The name was originally applied to the site of Mold Castle in connection with its builder Robert de Montalt, an Anglo-Norman lord. It is recorded as &quot;Mohald&quot; in a document of 1254.

==History==

A mile west of the town is Maes Garmon (&quot;The Field of Germanus&quot;), the traditional site of the &quot;Alleluia Victory&quot; by a force of Romano-Britons led by Germanus of Auxerre against the invading Picts and Scots, which occurred shortly after Easter, AD 430.

Mold developed around Mold Castle. The motte and bailey were built by the Norman Robert de Montalt in around 1140 in conjunction with the military invasion of Wales by Anglo-Norman forces. The castle was besieged numerous times by the Princes of Gwynedd as they fought to retake control of the eastern cantrefi in the &quot;Perfeddwlad&quot; (English: Middle Country). In 1146, Owain Gwynedd captured the castle. By 1167, Henry II was in possession of the castle, although it was recaptured by the Welsh forces of Llywelyn the Great in 1201.

Anglo-Norman authority over the area began again in 1241 when Dafydd ap Llywelyn yielded possession of the castle to the de Montalt family. However, he recaptured it from the Plantagenet nobility in 1245. The next few decades were a period of peace; Llywelyn ap Gruffudd built the Welsh native castle of Ewloe further to the east, establishing the House of Gwynedd&#x27;s military control over the area. Under Welsh rule, Mold Castle was deemed to be a &quot;royal stronghold&quot;. It was recaptured by the forces of Edward I during the first months of the war of 1276–77. Mold Castle was still a substantial fortification at the outbreak of the rebellion by Madog ap Llywelyn in 1294. However, with the death of the last Lord Montalt in 1329, the castle&#x27;s importance began to decline. The last mention of the fortification is in Patent Rolls from the early 15th century.

With the end of the Welsh Wars, English common law was introduced by the Statute of Rhuddlan. This led to an increase in commercial enterprise in the township which had been laid out around Mold Castle. Trade soon began between the Welsh community and English merchants in Chester and Whitchurch, Shropshire. During the medieval period, the town held two annual fairs and a weekly market, which brought in substantial revenues, as drovers brought their livestock to the English-Welsh border to be sold.

Nevertheless, tensions between the Welsh and the English remained. During the War of the Roses, Reinalt ab Grufydd ab Bleddyn, a Lancastrian captain who defended Harlech Castle for Henry VI against Yorkist forces, was constantly engaged in feuds with Chester. In 1465 a large number of armed men from Chester arrived at the Mold fair looking for trouble. A fight broke out which led to a pitched battle; eventually Reinalt triumphed and captured Robert Bryne, a former Mayor of Chester. The Welsh captain then took Bryne back to his tower house near Mold and hanged him. In retaliation, up to 200 men-at-arms were sent from Chester to seize Reinalt. However, the Welshman used his military experience to turn the tables on his attackers. He hid in the woods while many of the men entered his home; once they were inside, he rushed from concealment, blocked the door, and set fire to the building, trapping those inside. Reinalt then attacked the remainder, driving them back towards Chester.

By the late 15th century, the lordships around Mold had passed to the powerful Stanley family. In 1477 records mention that Thomas Stanley, 1st Earl of Derby had appointed numerous civic officials in Mold (including a mayor), was operating several mills, and had established a courthouse in the town.

===16th century onwards===
In the 1530s, the Tudor antiquarian John Leland noted the weekly market had been abandoned. By now Mold had two main streets, Streate Byle (Beili) and Streate Dadlede (Dadleu-dy), and about 40 houses making up the settlement. By the beginning of the 17th century, the population was rising with the development of the coal industry near the town. By the 1630s there were more than 120 houses and huts in the area.

The government of Elizabeth I had established royal representatives (Justices of the Peace, Sheriffs, and Lords Lieutenant) in every county of Wales. Mold developed into the administrative centre for Flintshire. By the 1760s, the Quarter Sessions were based in the town; the county hall was established in 1833, and the county gaol in 1871.

In 1833, workmen digging a Bronze Age mound at Bryn yr Ellyllon (&quot;Fairies&#x27; &quot;or &quot;Goblins&#x27; Hill&quot;) found a unique golden cape dating from 1900 to 1600 BCE. It weighs and was made from a single gold ingot about the size of a golf ball. It was broken when found and the fragments shared among the workmen, with the largest piece for Mr Langford, tenant of the field in which the mound stood. The find was recorded by the Vicar of Mold and came to the notice of the British Museum. In 1836 Langford sold his piece to the museum, which has since acquired most of the pieces, though it is said that some wives of the workmen sported new jewellery after the find. The restored cape now belongs to the British Museum.

Mold hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1923, 1991 and 2007. There was an unofficial National Eisteddfod event in 1873.

Mold was linked to Chester by the Mold Railway, with a large British Rail station and adjacent marshalling yards and engine sheds; however, the latter closed when Croes Newydd at Wrexham was opened, as did the station in 1962 in the Beeching cuts. However, the track survived until the mid-1980s to serve the Synthite chemical works. A Tesco supermarket was built on the station site in the 1990s.

===The Mold Riot===
In summer 1869 there was a riot in the town which had considerable effect on the subsequent policing of public disturbances in Britain.

On 17 May 1869, John Young, the English manager of the nearby colliery in Leeswood, angered his workers by announcing a pay cut. He had previously strained relationships with them by banning the use of the Welsh language underground. Two days later, after a meeting at the pithead, miners attacked Young before frogmarching him to the police station. Seven men were arrested and ordered to stand trial on 2 June. All were found guilty, and the convicted ringleaders, Ismael Jones and John Jones, were sentenced to a month&#x27;s hard labour.

A large crowd assembled to hear the verdict. The Chief Constable of Flintshire arranged for the presence of police from all over the county and soldiers from the 4th King&#x27;s Own Regiment (Lancaster), based temporarily at Chester. As the convicts were transferred to the railway station, a crowd of 1500–2000 grew restive and threw missiles at the officers, injuring many. Soldiers under their commanding officer, Captain Blake, opened fire on the crowd, killing four people. They included an innocent bystander, Margaret Younghusband, a 19-year-old domestic servant from Liverpool, who had been observing events from nearby high ground. The others killed were two colliers, Robert Hannaby and Edward Bellis, and Elizabeth Jones, who was shot in the back and died two days later.

A coroner&#x27;s inquest on the first three deaths was held on 5 June. The coroner, Peter Parry, was reportedly &quot;exceedingly old and infirm&quot;, &quot;so deaf as to be compelled to use a &#x27;speaking&#x27; trumpet&quot; and partially blind. He was assisted by the deputy coroner, his brother Robert Parry. The jury&#x27;s verdict, after clear direction from the coroner and retiring for only five minutes to consider the matter, was justifiable homicide. Later that afternoon, a second inquest on the death of Elizabeth Jones reached the same verdict.

The following week several men – Isaac Jones, William Griffiths, Rowland Jones, Gomer Jones and William Hughes – were tried for involvement in the riot. They were found guilty of &quot;felonious wounding&quot; and Lord Chief Justice Bovill sentenced all to ten years&#x27; penal servitude.

Although denying the connection, Daniel Owen, who lived in the town, featured some similar events in his first novel, &quot;Rhys Lewis&quot;, which was published in instalments in 1882–1884.

==Appearances==

===Television===
Harmony appeared in the unaired pilot as a member of Cordelia Chase&#x27;s clique, the &quot;Cordettes.&quot; She subsequently appears in the second episode of season 1, &quot;The Harvest,&quot; and makes appearances throughout the first three seasons, and then a larger role in another two. When Cordelia begins dating Xander Harris, Harmony shuns her from their clique and usurps her position as leader of the group. After Cordelia and Xander&#x27;s breakup, Harmony cruelly tricks Cordelia into thinking she has been re-admitted into the clique, only to humiliate and reject her. However, when Xander has Amy Madison cast a love spell in &quot;Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered,&quot; Harmony is one of the many women who becomes temporarily infatuated with him, then falls silent when Cordelia rebukes her and returns to dating Xander.

In the episode &quot;The Wish,&quot; a vengeance demon grants Cordelia&#x27;s wish that Buffy had never arrived in Sunnydale. Harmony appears in the alternate, hellish reality, again a follower of Cordelia&#x27;s &quot;Cordettes.&quot;

In the final showdown with Mayor Wilkins during his Ascension in the episode &quot;Graduation Day,&quot; Harmony (as part of an attempt by Buffy to help organize a student resistance) is killed/sired by a vampire. She reappears in the episode &quot;The Harsh Light of Day&quot; as a vampire, having retained her characteristic pettiness, susceptibility to stronger-willed people, and an affection for unicorn figurines. Harmony begins a sexual relationship with Spike, her &quot;blondie bear.&quot; Neither Spike nor Harmony are satisfied with their relationship; Spike is frustrated by Harmony&#x27;s ignorance and clinginess while she is exasperated with his endless broken promises and repeated attempts to kill Buffy. They separate, although she agrees to rekindle their relationship after Spike escapes from the Initiative. Harmony quickly regrets this decision after recognizing Spike&#x27;s renewed campaign against the Slayer, and even chases him out of her lair with a stake when he desperately seeks her help in the episode &quot;Pangs.&quot;

Spike&#x27;s ambition to kill the Slayer apparently rubs off. After separating from Spike, Harmony wants to be an independent, strong vampire who can get by on her own; accordingly, in the episode &quot;Real Me&quot;, she gathers her own gang and makes her own attempt to kill Buffy, which ends in disaster. Her minions destroyed, Harmony returns to Spike for protection until it becomes clear that Spike&#x27;s infatuation with Buffy has become an obsession (cf. &quot;Crush&quot;).

Having departed Sunnydale, Harmony is next seen in the &quot;Buffy&quot; spin-off &quot;Angel&quot;, in the episode &quot;Disharmony&quot;. She visits her old friend Cordelia in Los Angeles, not telling Cordelia she has become a vampire. Harmony tries to connect with Cordelia, but has difficulty controlling her demon side. She enters Cordelia&#x27;s bedroom at night, driven by bloodlust, but apologizes for her actions and intentions when Cordelia wakes up. Cordelia misunderstands her explanation, believing her to be a lesbian until the matter is cleared up by Willow in a phone call. Despite this, Cordelia insists on giving Harmony a chance, while the rest of the team grows increasingly frustrated with her habits such as popping gum or tearing pages out of old, irreplaceable books. She accompanies the Angel Investigations team on a mission to investigate a new vampire cult, but soon betrays them to their enemies. Cordelia nearly kills Harmony, but, out of some respect for the friendship they once shared and realizing that Harmony is struggling to find her own purpose in life, allows her to leave.

Over two years later, Harmony tries to make a life for herself in L.A. She gains employment at the L.A. branch of Wolfram &amp; Hart, as a member of the secretarial pool. Harmony is attracted by the building&#x27;s necro-tempered glass windows (designed to protect vampires from sunlight which would otherwise cause them to burst into flames), as well as the firm&#x27;s non-judgmental workplace culture and dental plan. A few weeks into her employment with the firm, Wesley Wyndam-Pryce hires her out of the blue to be Angel&#x27;s new personal secretary, after Angel and his staff are given control of that branch of Wolfram &amp; Hart; Wesley apparently thought a familiar face would be good for Angel. Angel reluctantly agrees, on the strict condition that Harmony continues to refrain from drinking human blood.

Harmony is reunited with Spike when he returns, first as a ghost and then in corporeal form. She tries to connect with him, and initially hopes to renew their relationship now that he has a soul. Spike shows no interest for Harmony until he regains his corporeal form and proceeds to seduce her into a brief, disastrous fling, after which neither of them puts any effort into rekindling their tumultuous relationship.

At this point in her un-life, Harmony feels isolated and alone. She knows that she is incompetent as an evil vampire, but her struggle to lead a more normal life is hindered because she lacks a soul. Angel often treats her with distrust and barely masked hostility, and her input, ideas, and presence are generally ignored by his team. Harmony also experiences an inability to connect with her co-workers, who resent her quick rise to the position of the CEO&#x27;s secretary. In the episode &quot;Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;, she is framed for murder by Tamika, another vampire secretary who wants her job; Tamika also substitutes human blood for her supply of otter blood, to make it appear as though Harmony drank from the victim. She clears her name and ironically saves a demon summit by staking her scheming rival on a conference table with a pair of chopsticks, since the demons required a W&amp;H employee&#x27;s death to seal their deal. Despite her incompetence, Harmony manages to prove a &#x27;sort of&#x27; asset to the team, &quot;torturing&quot; Eve (i.e. hitting Eve in the face a few times) to get information, helping Wesley search for information about Knox&#x27;s plans, and aiding Lorne in protecting Eve from her replacement as their liaison to the Senior Partners. She strikes up a brief friendship with Fred Burkle, though her relationship with Illyria, the demon who later inhabits Fred&#x27;s body, is quite frosty.

Harmony becomes a member of the regular cast starting with the episode &quot;Underneath&quot;. In the series finale, &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, she betrays Angel, revealing his plans to go after Archduke Sebassis to Marcus Hamilton, the Senior Partners&#x27; new liaison, with whom she has a sexual relationship. Angel, however, always expected her to betray him at some point, so he had only confided information he wanted her to reveal. After her betrayal (which Angel blames on her lack of a soul, and she blames on his lack of confidence in her), he fires her, but not before providing her with a letter of recommendation (which he had already written and signed, in anticipation of her disloyalty). As Angel and Hamilton prepare to fight each other, she runs off, wishing them both luck: &quot;May the best man win!&quot;

===Literature===

According to the &quot;Sunnydale High Yearbook&quot; tie-in book, Harmony is a member of the field hockey team, Dance Club, and Drama Club in addition to cheerleading, writes a brief fashion article about the Homecoming Dance dresses, and is voted &quot;Biggest Attitude&quot; by her peers.

In the canonical continuation of &quot;Buffy&quot;, &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Harmony features in the twenty-first issue, &quot;Harmonic Divergence&quot; by Jane Espenson, which begins a story-arc about the public revelation of the existence of vampires and Slayers. Harmony becomes a MTV reality television star in her own TV series, &quot;Harmony Bites&quot;, which also stars Clem. Harmony came to instant notoriety after she killed a Slayer who attacked her on live camera. Thanks to Harmony, Buffy and her Slayer army were publicly outed by Anderson Cooper on CNN&#x27;s &quot;Anderson Cooper 360°&quot; later that day. Dark Horse Comics created a MySpace page for Harmony, and the Myspace Dark Horse Presents features a special comic book &#x27;episode&#x27; of &quot;Harmony Bites&quot; written by Jane Espenson. Harmony is now considered a vampire rights spokeswoman. At the end of the twenty-second issue, &quot;Swell&quot;, she is seen being interviewed on TV about the destruction of the Vampy Cat toy line by the Slayers, which she blames on their blind hatred of anything vampire-related (in actuality, the toys were possessed demonic creatures). This, in combination with the criminal activities of rogue Slayer Simone Doffler, the destruction of Sunnydale and the machinations of the villain Twilight has forced the Slayers into retreat as the whole world now views them as terrorists.

Harmony appears twice in Angel &amp; Faith. During &quot;In Perfect Harmony&quot; it is revealed she used her fame to create rules that when vampires feed from humans they can never kill nor sire and must bite only after the human gives permission. The vast majority of vampires follow these rules for the easy food. Harmony is being threatened with a sex tape that shows her siring a man who was dying of cancer. Angel &amp; Faith reluctantly agree to help her find the blackmailer so vampires continue following her rules and do not start killing humans again. Harmony&#x27;s staff create a plan to restore Angel&#x27;s image after his actions as Twilight have left him hated by both humans and demons. The blackmailer is revealed to be Clem who has fallen in love with Harmony and wanted to be her hero by stopping the blackmailer. Harmony won&#x27;t date him but is easily willing to forget people&#x27;s past actions, and tells Angel He should do the same with his overwhelming guilt over his centuries of killing humans. In turn, Angel tells Faith that famous people are crazy, and instantly throws the image plan into the trash.

In &quot;Spike &amp; Faith&quot; Angel gives Spike Harmony&#x27;s phone number when Spike is trying to get over his depression about his relationship with Buffy. Spike and Harmony have loud sexual activities in Faith&#x27;s home; much to Angel &amp; Faith&#x27;s discomfort.

Harmony returns in the tenth issue of Buffy season 10 in an issue titled &quot;Day Off (Harmony In My Head).&quot; The Scoobies have taken up residence in San Francisco, and are tasked with writing the rules of the new magic in the world by using the pages of Buffy&#x27;s &quot;Vampyr&quot; book. They invite several species from the mystical world as lobbyists to consider when creating the rules. Buffy is annoyed when Harmony shows up representing the older type vampires, but is happy to see Clem is with her. Buffy is also displeased that the new breed of vampires have selected a vampire named Vicki as their representative, because Vicki previously attempted to kill her.

The new breed of vampire is immune to sunlight and can shape-shift. Harmony creates a compromise; the new breed will follow her rules for peaceful interaction with humans, and the Scoobies can create a rule so the new breed will be unable to shape-shift in the daylight. Harmony then visits Spike who apologizes for using her in London, but she doesn&#x27;t care. She feels that she used him in payback for the way he dumped her in Sunnydale. Harmony then knocks Spike unconscious. Harmony then tries to have Clem write in the new rule book which would make her beloved by the whole world, and for Buffy, Spike, and Angel to finally make peace with each other. Lastly, she wants the book to make Buffy&#x27;s love triangle to agree to a marriage polygamous marriage amongst the three. Clem does not do this, as the book may hurt Harmony due to its wish fulfillments often being twisted like a Monkey&#x27;s paw. Spike takes back the book from Harmony and Clem, then kicks them both out.

However, Clem wrote one thing in the book for Harmony; unicorns are now real.

Harmony appears next in the twenty-first issue, &quot;In Pieces on the Ground, Part I.&quot; Demon invasions have become a global problem, the Scooby Gang is reluctantly working with the human military to battle this problem, but they also need the strength and numbers of both breeds of vampires. With Harmony leading the old breed and Vicki the new, they have Buffy and Spike compete in trials of combat to win the vampires&#x27; allegiance. While the other one fights, Harmony taunts Spike and Vicki taunts Buffy about the relationship insecurities they each have. With the vampires&#x27; loyalty won, Buffy and Spike leave rattled, while Harmony and Vicki congratulate each other for their accomplishment.

==Powers and abilities==
Harmony has the standard powers and vulnerabilities of a vampire. Several episodes make comedy of her subpar fighting skills, though after later training she holds her own against Riley and Spike, and in &quot;Harm&#x27;s Way&quot; she kills another vampire after a long battle. In &quot;Harmonic Divergence&quot;, she kills a Slayer, though partially by accident. In the &quot;Harmony Bites&quot; e-comic, she easily kills Justin, a vampire she sired, by quickly deflecting his attempt at staking her.

In &quot;Conviction&quot;, she claimed to &quot;type like a superhero, if there was a superhero whose power was typing.&quot;

==Appearances==

Harmony has 48 canonical appearances in the Buffyverse.

<text>Augostino Carlini or Agostino Carlini (c. 1718 – 15 August 1790) was an Italian sculptor and painter, who was born in Genoa but settled in England. He was also one of the founding members of the Royal Academy in 1768.

==Life==
He features in a group portrait, by Johann Zoffany, of the founders, and is one of three sitters (with Francesco Bartolozzi and Giovanni Battista Cipriani) in a 1777 portrait displayed in the National Portrait Gallery in London. He was Keeper of the Royal Academy from 1783 until his death in 1790. He exhibited a portrait in oil in 1776.

He worked, with fellow Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi at Somerset House, and on statues at Custom House in Dublin. He is particularly noted for various church monuments, including a memorial to Lady Sophia Petty at All Saints&#x27; Parish Church, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and one commissioned by Joseph Damer in 1775 to commemorate his wife Caroline, which stands in the north transept of Milton Abbey in Dorset.

Also in 1775, Carlini was commissioned by Dr William Hunter, the first Professor of Anatomy at the Royal Academy schools, to make a cast of the flayed corpse of a recently executed smuggler. The figure was posed as a Roman statue, the &quot;Dying Gaul&quot;, and given the pseudo-classical title &quot;Smugglerius&quot;.

He died unmarried at Carlisle Street, London, leaving all his estate to &quot;Elizabeth Watton, spinster&quot;, his maid and housekeeper.

<text>McNab/Braeside is a township in eastern Ontario, Canada, on the south shore of Chats Lake (part of the Ottawa River), straddling the lower Madawaska River in Renfrew County. The township was created on January 1, 1998, when the Village of Braeside amalgamated with McNab Township.

==History==
McNab township was created in 1825, comprising roughly 80,000 acres of unsettled land, covering the current Town of Arnprior and Township of McNab/Braeside. It was granted by the government (&quot;Family Compact&quot;) to Archibald 13th Laird of McNab (1779-1860), who had fled from his debts in Scotland. He promised to settle it with Highland clansmen, and the first group of eighty-four settlers arrived the same year, 1825. McNab ruled with an iron fist over the Scottish settlers. Only after eighteen years of petitions, court battles, and appeals was his grip loosened when the government finally began issuing Crown grants to the settlers. His feudal powers removed, the Laird eventually sold his lands to the government and returned to Europe in 1852, never to return.

Braeside was named in 1872 by W.J. McDonald probably for Braeside, Greenock in Inverclyde, Scotland.

==Communities==

In addition to the main town of Braeside, the township also comprises the communities of Burnstown, Clay Bank, Clay Valley, Dewars, Glasgow Station, Goshen, Lochwinnoch (partially), Lundys Corners, Pine Grove, Sand Point, Stewartville, Rhoddy’s Bay, Waba and White Lake.

Burnstown is a picturesque village about 53 miles (85 km) from downtown Ottawa using Highway 417.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, McNab/Braeside had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, an increase of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.
==Local government==
List of former mayors:
* Mary M. Campbell (2006–2014)
* Tom Peckett (2014–2022)
* Mark MacKenzie (2022–present)

In December 2023, the township&#x27;s council voted to suspend Mayor Mackenzie&#x27;s pay for 60 days following a report by the integrity commissioner that found Mackenzie had threatened and intimidated both staff and council colleagues. On April 16, 2024, Mackenzie decided to suspend himself for 60 days, stating he is no longer comfortable being the face of the township.
