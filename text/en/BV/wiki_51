<text>Mystery! is an anthology television series produced by WGBH Boston for PBS in the United States.

The series was created as a mystery, police and crime drama spin-off of the PBS show &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. From 1980 to 2007, &quot;Mystery!&quot; aired mostly British crime series purchased from or co-produced with the BBC or ITV and adapted from British mystery fiction. In 2002, due to pressure to include more American material, a series based on the novels of US mystery writer Tony Hillerman was produced, but the vast majority of &quot;Mystery!&quot; programming has always been and continues to be British literary adaptations co-produced with UK-based production companies.

In 2008, PBS combined &quot;Mystery!&quot; with its predecessor &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; under the umbrella title &quot;Masterpiece&quot;, which includes the sub-brands &quot;Masterpiece Classic&quot;, &quot;Masterpiece Mystery!&quot;, and &quot;Masterpiece Contemporary&quot;.

==Edward Gorey, Derek Lamb, and the &quot;Mystery!&quot; opening sequence==

&quot;Mystery!&quot; is noted for its animated opening and closing title sequences with original drawings created by cartoonist Edward Gorey and animated by Eugene Federenko, Derek Lamb, and Janet Perlman, with music by Normand Roger. A PBS veteran, animator Lamb had also created programming for series like &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;The Electric Company&quot;, and &quot;The Great American Dream Machine&quot;.

Gorey’s first attempt at creating a storyboard of the opening was estimated to run 10 minutes. Because executive producer Joan Wilson was looking for a 75-second sequence, Gorey was eventually asked to hand over the drawings and allow animators to use his work as inspiration. Gorey, known for his eccentric and stubborn nature, recounted:

The Lamb/Gorey sequence has changed several times since 1980. It consisted of a non-linear series of animated period country house tableaux. The scenes include a formal ball, a crowd of umbrella-toting funeral attendants, three investigators, a croquet game in the rain, and a moaning damsel in various scenes of distress. Over time, the sequence became more streamlined, shorter, and slightly more colorful. For the Hillerman episodes, the American flag was worked into the opening title sequence.

Today, the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; opening sequence is almost identical across the sub-brands. Each opening fades in and out of scenes of popular characters from each series. The &quot;Mystery!&quot; version still features the Gorey/Lamb characters.

==Inception and early history==
&quot;Mystery!&quot; was the second British anthology to come to WGBH Boston after &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;. In 1979, Mobil Oil head of corporate affairs Herb Schmertz offered the idea of an all-British crime series show to WGBH manager Henry Becton. Mobil Oil was already the underwriter for &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and had seen success with high-profile British series, including &quot;The Six Wives of Henry VIII&quot; and &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;. By 1979, WGBH was bringing in a diverse array of British programming, to the point that Mobil saw an advantage to creating a unique time slot for the crime/police drama genre. Mobil spent 2.3 million in 1979 and 3.2 million in 1980 toward the shows it sponsored on PBS, including for the kickoff of &quot;Mystery!&quot; Not everyone was especially enthusiastic over the genre division between &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and &quot;Mystery!&quot; Then &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; host Alistair Cooke initially bemoaned the loss of the crime genre:

One of &quot;Mystery!&quot; early successes was &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;. Other noted successes include &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; starring Jeremy Brett in the title role, &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; with John Thaw, &quot;Brother Cadfael&quot; starring Derek Jacobi, and &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; starring Helen Mirren. Agatha Christie sleuths Hercule Poirot (David Suchet) and Miss Marple (at various times Joan Hickson, Geraldine McEwan, and Julia McKenzie) have also been featured.

&quot;Mystery!&quot; won both the 1988 Anthony Award and the 1991 Anthony Award for &quot;Best Television Show&quot;.

==Hosts==
The first host of the show in 1980 was Gene Shalit. In the first broadcast, February 5, 1980, Shalit opened with the introduction: “Good evening. We’re about to set out on a series of entertaining mysteries—15 weeks of suspenseful, sophisticated, crafty conundrums that are darkly diabolical or amusing adventures with introductions that suddenly seem alarmingly alliterative.” Shalit left the show in 1981.

Vincent Price took the reins in &quot;Mystery!&quot;’s second year. Price’s introductions included haunted house gags, including walking through cobwebs and ducking under spiders and bats. He came to Boston twice a year to tape openings and closings for the show. Actress Katherine Emory called Price “the sweetest scary man I ever met&quot;. Price was in his seventies when he hosted the show, and eventually had to step down due to failing health in 1989.

Diana Rigg took over as host in 1989 and had the opportunity to introduce two mystery series in which she was the star: &quot;Mother Love&quot; and &quot;The Mrs Bradley Mysteries&quot;. Rigg had previously won a BAFTA Award for her work on &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; 1985 &quot;Bleak House&quot; adaptation. She left &quot;Mystery!&quot; in 2003.

Beginning in 2004, &quot;Mystery!&quot; aired without a host. When the show was rebranded under the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; umbrella in 2008, actor Alan Cumming became the host.

==Funding trouble: 1996–2007==
In the summer of 1995, Mobil announced that it would stop funding &quot;Mystery!&quot; at the end of the season. Its underwritten series &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and &quot;Mystery!&quot; had been losing audiences for some time.

&quot;Many times, over the years, we&#x27;ve watched our best mini-series debut with a flourish … only to see the audience gently or not so gently erode over the weeks,&quot; executive producer Rebecca Eaton said, citing last year&#x27;s &quot;Middlemarch&quot; as an example.&quot;.

Although Mobil had been experiencing restructuring, cutting 1,250 employees, the company refused to blame its actions on cost cutting. The company announced that it would stay with &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; at least through 1999 though it didn’t leave as underwriter until 2004. After the ExxonMobil merger in 1999, the company reoriented its philanthropic mission to support public health and environmental causes, dropping its commitment to public television. PBS had avoided adding 30-second advertisements before programming blocks, despite underwriters’ requests for more robust representation on the channel. Mobil swore that the decision had nothing to do with PBS’s hesitancy in implementing 30-second advertising spots for its underwriters. Since 1980, Mobil had covered the entire cost of acquiring, repackaging and promoting British dramas for PBS, which had typically cost the company around $10 million a year. Without Mobil, &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and &quot;Mystery!&quot; were left without consistent support until 2011.

As a result of Mobil&#x27;s initial break from &quot;Mystery!&quot;, Eaton and her staff began looking for newer, more “relevant” stories to tell in both shows. They also looked to past successes for help. &quot;Prime Suspect&quot; had gained a strong following in the US as well as England, so PBS re-ran Series 4 on &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; during the 1995-1996 season.

PBS shifted &quot;Mystery!&quot; in 2002 from its Thursday prime-time slot during the regular American TV season to Sunday nights in the summer. &quot;Mystery!&quot; continued as a summer series from 2002 to 2004 with shows like &quot;The Inspector Lynley Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; and &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot;.

==2008 format change==
In 2008, the series was absorbed into &quot;Masterpiece&quot; (the former &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot;) and began using the banner Masterpiece Mystery! In addition, the theme music was changed. It now carried a signature theme based on its sister program&#x27;s former theme. This version is hosted by Alan Cumming.

Rebecca Eaton reflected on the 2008 changes in an interview with Diane Rehm, citing Mobil’s departure, a competitive media landscape, and trouble branding &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and &quot;Mystery!&quot; to new audiences. Eaton said:

“I realized that this ship of whom I was the captain was at risk of going down, and that I had to do something. And I truly did not know what to do and had no money to do anything anyway. But we got a grant from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and PBS which we were pretty much allowed to do anything with...we spent it on doing some research into how people perceived Masterpiece. And discovered that they used to watch it, they loved it, they regarded it very highly. They weren&#x27;t watching it so much anymore. They thought it was too hard to find...And a lot of people were put off by the title. They thought, oh it sounds like it will be very challenging. It sounds like homework...We didn&#x27;t change the content because we realized whenever anybody, particularly younger viewers watched it, watched Madame Bovary or Sense and Sensibility or Bleak House, they loved it. It was just sort of getting past the rather forbidding title of &quot;Masterpiece Theater&quot; and the confusing anthology nature.”

==In popular culture==
*&quot;Mystery!&quot; was parodied by &quot;Sesame Street&quot; &quot;Mysterious Theatre&quot; sketches in the early 1990s, hosted by the Muppet character Vincent Twice (whose name was always said twice), a parody of Vincent Price.
* The 1990s &quot;Mystery!&quot; opening was parodied on a 1998 episode of fellow WGBH program &quot;Arthur&quot; entitled &quot;Binky Rules.&quot;

<text>The blood pheasant (Ithaginis cruentus) or blood partridge is a galliforme bird in the pheasant family Phasianidae and the only species in the genus Ithaginis. It is a relatively small, short-tailed pheasant that is widespread in the lower Himalayas ranging across North and East India, Nepal, Bhutan, South China and northern Myanmar. It has been classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List since 2009, and the global blood pheasant population is thought to be stable.

The blood pheasant is the state bird of Sikkim, India.

== Description ==

The blood pheasant has the size of a small fowl, about in length with a short, convex, very strong black bill, feathered between bill and eye, and a small crest of variously coloured feathers. The colour of the plumage above is dark ash, with white shafts, the coverts of the wings various tinged with green, with broad strokes of white through the length of each feather, the feathers of the chin deep crimson; on the breast, belly, and sides, feathers are lance-shaped, of various length, the tips green with crimson margins, collectively resembling dashes of blood scattered on the breast and belly. The tail consists of 12 subequal feathers, shafts white, rounded, the ends whitish, the coverts a rich crimson red.

Both males and females have red feet and a distinct ring of bare skin around the eye that typically is crimson colored, but is orange in a few subspecies. Females are more uniformly colored, being overall dull brown and often with some gray to the nape. Although some of the subspecies that have been described are highly distinctive, others are not, and some variation appears to be clinal. Consequently, the number of valid subspecies is disputed, with various authorities recognizing between 11 and 15. They mainly vary in the plumage of the males, especially the amount of red or black to the throat, forehead, neck, chest and tail, and the presence or absence of rufous in the wings.

==Taxonomy==
Twelve subspecies have been described:
* &quot;I. c. affinis&quot; – Sikkim region in India
* &quot;I. c. beicki&quot; – Beick&#x27;s blood pheasant – north-central China
* &quot;I. c. berezowskii&quot; – Berezovski&#x27;s blood pheasant – mountains of central China
* &quot;I. c. clarkei&quot; – Clarke&#x27;s blood pheasant – southwest China
* &quot;I. c. cruentus&quot; – Himalayan blood pheasant – northern Nepal to northwestern Bhutan
* &quot;I. c. geoffroyi&quot; – Geoffroy&#x27;s blood pheasant – western China and southeast Tibet
* &quot;I. c. kuseri&quot; – Kuser&#x27;s blood pheasant – upper Assam in India and southeast Tibet
* &quot;I. c. marionae&quot; – Mrs. Vernay&#x27;s blood pheasant – mountains of southwest China and northeast Myanmar
* &quot;I. c. michaelis&quot; – Bianchi&#x27;s blood pheasant – north-central China
* &quot;I. c. rocki&quot; – Rock&#x27;s blood pheasant – southwestern China
* &quot;I. c. sinensis&quot; – David&#x27;s blood pheasant – central China
* &quot;I. c. tibetanus&quot; – Tibetan blood pheasant – eastern Bhutan and southern Tibet

== Distribution and habitat ==
Blood pheasants live in the mountains of Nepal, Sikkim, northern Myanmar, Tibet, and central and south-central China, where they prefer coniferous or mixed forests and scrub areas near the snowline. They move their range depending on the seasons, and are found at higher elevations during the summer. With snow increasing in fall and winter, they move to lower elevations.

==Ecology==
Unlike the common pheasant, the blood pheasant is monogamous. Breeding season begins at the end of April when males begin their courtship by displaying in front of females by flying at each other breast-to-breast, biting wattles, or performing high leaps with kicks toward the other’s bill. Mate choice by females depends on factors like tail length, length of the ear tufts, and the presence of black points in the wattle, but neither wattle size or color nor the brightness of the plumage affect the females&#x27; choice. 

The blood pheasant reaches sexual maturity in one year. In early May, mature females begin nesting under paddy straw heaps surrounded by trees, in brush, small caves, or in tree holes near the ground. They excavate shallow pot-like nests and line them with moss, pine needles, and feathers. The female lays 4-14 yellowish-white eggs with brown speckles, at intervals of two or three days. During the 27-33 days of egg incubation, the male is responsible for defending the territory against other male pheasants.

The blood pheasant&#x27;s distribution in inhospitable high-elevation environments has required adaptation to hypoxia and high levels of ultraviolet radiation.

Blood pheasants move with the snow line when foraging, feeding on moss, ferns, pine shoots, and lichens.

==Conservation==
The species is currently classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. However, more than half the population is considered to be threatened by habitat loss and fragmentation, illegal hunting and human disturbance. Much of the distribution range of pheasants in Southwest China overlaps with the habitat of the giant panda, and livestock grazing has become the most prevalent human disturbance across associated protection areas. The blood pheasant&#x27;s ground-nesting habits and relatively long incubation period make it especially vulnerable to trampling and habitat degradation by grazers.

<doc id="620938" wikidata="Q3348235" url="?curid=620938" title="Ian Smith (New Zealand cricketer)">
<text>Ian David Stockley Smith (born 28 February 1957) is a New Zealand cricket and rugby commentator and former cricketer. He played as a wicket-keeper for New Zealand throughout the 1980s and part of the 1990s.

== Early life ==
Ian Smith was born in Nelson, New Zealand to a family of keen golfers. They moved to Wanganui when he was one and then to Wellington when he was eight years old. It was here where Smith first played cricket at the Miramar Park Cricket Club. He was initially an off spinner who &quot;batted a bit&quot;. He was a member of the Wellington Primary Schools&#x27; team and was selected for the North Island Primary Schools&#x27; team and captained the North Island under-12 soccer team in 1969. In his high school years, he moved to Palmerston North and concentrated on playing as a wicket-keeper. In 1978, he played as a substitute fielder for New Zealand in their Test match against Pakistan in Napier and was delighted to be paid NZ$100. His car broke down after the game; the repairs cost NZ$99.95.

== Domestic career ==
Ian Smith first played for Central Districts in 1978 against the touring English team. In his fourth game for Central Districts against Canterbury, he was knocked unconscious by a short delivery bowled by Richard Hadlee. Smith went off injured but returned the following day to make 60 runs. He had a particularly good season batting in 1982/3 for Central Districts, scoring three centuries (145 against Auckland, 111 and 143 against Northern Districts).

==International career==
Ian Smith was first selected to play for New Zealand in 1980 on their Australian tour after having played for the Young New Zealand team. His first game for New Zealand was against a Victorian Country XI. He was not included in the test eleven for the first test in Brisbane at the &#x27;Gabba but when Warren Lees failed a fitness test on the first morning, Smith was elevated into the test team.

By the end of his playing career, Smith had the second highest strike rate as a batsman who&#x27;d played at least 20 innings&#x27; for One Day Internationals – 99 runs per 100 balls faced, coming just behind Lance Cairns. He also holds the record for the highest score in Tests for a batsman coming in at number nine, which is 173 off 136 balls, scored against India at Eden Park in 1990. During the innings, he became joint holder of the record for most runs scored off a six-ball Test over, striking 24 runs off Atul Wassan.

==After cricket==
After Smith retired from cricket, he worked in the banking industry before moving into broadcasting. He worked as a radio announcer on Radio Live SPORT as a breakfast host and was a commentator for Sky Sport (in New Zealand, commentating on both rugby union and cricket). As a cricket commentator, he has also worked on television commentary at numerous ICC tournaments including the World Twenty20 and Cricket World Cup calling the crucial final ball as England tied with New Zealand in the final at Lords. Smith&#x27;s description of England winning the World Cup “by the barest of margins, the barest of all margins” has become iconic in English cricket. He has also appeared as a guest commentator on Sky Sports and Test Match Special in the UK during New Zealand tours of England.

He&#x27;s also used for some of the Australian cricket coverage for Nine Network and now Fox Sports but doesn&#x27;t appear on Spark Sport&#x27;s coverage for home matches.

Smith took an active role in presenting the Rugby World Cup on Sky in New Zealand in 2011.

In April 2020, Smith won New Zealand Cricket&#x27;s most prestigious award, the Bert Sutcliffe Medal for Outstanding Contribution to Cricket.

In January 2023, Smith departed from Sky Sport after 23 years. Smith said of leaving &quot;Sky TV has a changing face now, a long way removed from this old scaly, sunburnt one,&quot;

His son Jarrod Smith is an association football player who has appeared for the New Zealand national team.

==Honours and awards==
In the 1994 New Year Honours, Smith was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to cricket. In April 2020, he was awarded the Bert Sutcliffe Medal by New Zealand Cricket for outstanding services to cricket.

<text>Hapkeite is a mineral discovered in the Dhofar 280 meteorite found in 2000 in Oman on the Arabian Peninsula. The meteorite is believed to originate from the Moon; specifically, it appears to be a fragment of lunar highland breccia. Hapkeite&#x27;s composition is of silicon and iron, and it is similar to other silicon-iron minerals found on Earth. An impact on the Moon is thought to have launched the partially molten or vaporized material into orbit.

Due to its 1:2 composition of silicon-iron, hapkeite was given the chemical formula Fe2Si. It occurs as opaque, yellowish to silvery microscopic isometric crystals.

It is named after Bruce Hapke, who predicted the presence and importance of vapor-deposited coatings on lunar soil grains (space weathering).

Beside hapkeite, other natural iron silicide minerals include gupeiite, naqite, linzhiite, luobusaite, suessite, xifengite, and zangboite.

<text>HMS &quot;Gurkha&quot; (F122) was a of the Royal Navy. She was named after an ethnic group located in Nepal, and who continue to serve in the British Army. She was sold to the Indonesian Navy in 1984 and renamed KRI &quot;Wilhelmus Zakarias Yohannes&quot; (332).

==Design==
The Tribal-, or Type 81-class, frigates were developed in the mid-1950s as a General Purpose frigate, capable of use in both anti-submarine and anti-aircraft duties in a full-scale war, while serving for Cold War policing duties in peace-time, in particular to replace the old s serving in the Persian Gulf.
The Tribals were long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of . The ship&#x27;s hull had a draught of , with the propeller increasing overall draught to . Displacement was standard and full load. Propulsion was by a single-shaft Combined steam and gas (COSAG) arrangement, effectively half of the powerplant of the s. A single Babcock &amp; Wilcox boiler fed steam at and to a geared steam turbine rated at , which could be supplemented by a Metrovick G-6 gas turbine rated at to reach top speed, with the gas turbine also allowing the ship to get underway quickly in an emergency, without having to wait to raise steam. Speed was about using both steam and gas turbine power, and on steam power alone.

The ships were fitted with two QF 4.5-in (113 mm) Mark 5 guns, salvaged from scrapped Second World War destroyers, mounted fore and aft. It was intended to fit two Seacat anti-aircraft missile launchers, but these were not ready in time, and &quot;Gurkha&quot; completed with two 40 mm Bofors guns instead, with Seacat replacing the Bofors guns on refit. For anti-submarine and anti-ship duties, a hangar and flight deck for a single Westland Wasp helicopter was fitted, while a Limbo anti-submarine mortar provided close-in anti-submarine armament.
&quot;Gurkha&quot; was fitted with a large Type 965 long range air search radar on a lattice foremast, with a Type 993 short range air/surface target indicating radar and Type 978 navigation radar also fitted. An MRS3 fire control system was carried to direct the 4.5-inch guns. The ship had a sonar suite of Type 177 medium range search sonar, Type 162 bottom search and Type 170 attack sonar. Type 199 Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) was fitted in 1969. The ship had a crew of 253 officers and other ranks.

==Royal Navy service==

&quot;Gurkha&quot; was ordered under the 1955–56 Naval Estimates from John I. Thornycroft &amp; Company, of Woolston, Hampshire, at a cost of £4,865,000 She was laid down on 3 November 1958, was launched on 11 July 1960 and commissioned on 13 February 1963, joining the 9th Frigate Squadron in the Middle East. In 1965 she was present at Portsmouth Navy Days, and again deployed to the Middle East with the 9th Frigate Squadron. On 19 June 1966, &quot;Gurkha&quot; sailed from Aden to the Seychelles to support the Seychelles police as a series of strikes threatened violence. On 14 January 1967 she commenced her third commission, leaving British waters on 24 July. She served on the Beira Patrol and during the withdrawal of British forces from Aden before carrying out patrol operations in the Persian Gulf, returning to Rosyth on 14 May 1968.

In 1975, &quot;Gurkha&quot; deployed to the West Indies, where the ship performed various duties. In 1976, &quot;Gurkha&quot; supported Royal Navy efforts against Iceland during the Third Cod War. She sustained superficial damage on 7 May when the patrol ship attempted to force the ship towards the British trawler &quot;Ross Ramilles&quot;, during which &quot;Óðinn&quot; collided with &quot;Gurkha&quot;. In that collision &quot;Óðinn&quot;″s port propeller was damaged by &quot;Gurkha&quot;″s starboard stabiliser, forcing her to return to port for repairs.

&quot;Gurkha&quot; was present at the 1977 Spithead Fleet Review, held in honour of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Silver Jubilee. At this time she was part of the 1st Frigate Squadron.

Gurkha was reduced to the reserve in 1980, being placed in the Standby Squadron. Although she had been put on the disposal list, &quot;Gurkha&quot; was removed from the reserve during the Falklands War and prepared for active service, recommissioning on 24 July. &quot;Gurkha&quot; remained in home waters, fulfilling duties in the absence of ships that were operating in the South Atlantic.

In October 1982, &quot;Gurkha&quot; became Gibraltar Guardship, following this was a deployment to the Caribbean late in 1982 on &quot;Carib Train&quot; returning to the UK in early 1983. During this later part of her life she had a section of Gurkhas onboard instead of the usual Royal Marine contingent.

==Indonesian Navy service==
After being decommissioned in March 1984, &quot;Gurkha&quot; was sold to Indonesia in April that year, and after a refit at Vosper Thornycroft&#x27;s Woolston, Southampton shipyard, the ship was commissioned into the Indonesian Navy on 21 October 1985. She was renamed KRI &quot;Wilhelmus Zakarias Yohannes&quot; for the Indonesian national hero Wilhelmus Zakaria Johannes, a radiologist and specialist in X-ray technology. The frigate was stricken from service in 2000.

<text>A water dispenser, sometimes referred to as a water cooler (if used for cooling only), is a machine that dispenses and often also cools or heats up water with a refrigeration unit. It is commonly located near the restroom due to closer access to plumbing. A drain line is also provided from the water cooler into the sewer system.

Water dispensers come in a variety of form factors, ranging from wall-mounted to bottle filler water dispenser combination units, to bi-level units and other formats. They are generally broken up into two categories: (POU) water dispensers and bottled water dispensers. POU water dispensers are connected to a water supply, while bottled water dispensers require delivery (or self-pick-up) of water in large bottles from vendors. Bottled water dispensers can be top-mounted or bottom-loaded, depending on the design of the model.

Bottled water dispensers typically use 5-gallon (18.9 litres) bottles commonly located on top of the unit. Pressure coolers are a subcategory of water dispensers encompassing drinking water fountains and direct-piping water dispensers. Water cooler may also refer to a primitive device for keeping water cool.

==History==

==Dispenser types==
===Wall-mounted / recessed===
The wall-mounted type is connected to the building&#x27;s water supply for a continuous supply of water and electricity to run a refrigeration unit to cool the incoming water, and to the building&#x27;s waste disposal system to dispose of unused water. Wall-mounted water coolers are frequently used in commercial buildings like hospitals, schools, businesses, and other facilities where a facility manager is present to monitor its installation and maintenance.

In the standard wall-mounted cooler, also commonly referred to as a water fountain or drinking fountain, a small tank in the machine holds chilled water so the user does not have to wait for chilled water. Water is delivered by turning or pressing a button on a spring-loaded valve located on the top of the unit, that turns off the water when released. Some devices also offer a large button on the front or side. Newer machines may not have a button at all; instead, a sensor that detects when someone is near and activates the water. Water is delivered in a stream that arches up, allowing the user to drink directly from the top of the stream of water. These devices usually dispense water directly from the municipal water supply, without treatment or filtering.

Wall mount water coolers come in a wide variety of styles, from recessed models to splash resistant, contoured basins protruding out from the wall, traditional rounded square edge designs, bottle filler and water cooler combination units, bi-level designs, with other features and options. These are sometimes installed to meet local, state or federal codes.

===Bottom-load water dispenser===

Water dispensers commonly have the water supply vessel mounted at the top of the unit. Bottom-load water dispensers have the vessel mounted at the bottom of the unit to make loading easier.

===Tabletop water dispenser===

There are also smaller versions of the water dispensers where the dispenser can be placed directly on top of a table. These dispensers are commonly classified as household appliances and can often be found in household kitchens and office pantries.

===Direct-piping water dispenser (POU)===
Water dispensers can be directly connected to the in-house water source for continuous dispensing of hot and cold drinking water.
It is commonly referred to as POU () water dispensers. POU units are generally more hygienic than bottled water coolers, provided the end user has access to clean water sources.

===Freestanding===
A freestanding design generally involves bottles of water placed spout-down into the dispensing machine.

Tabletop or kitchen worktop versions are available which utilize readily available five-liter water bottles from supermarkets. These coolers use air pumps to push the water into the cooling chamber and Peltier devices to chill the water.

New development within the water cooler market is the advent of countertop appliances which are connected to the mains and provide an instant supply of not only chilled water but also hot and boiling water. This is often visible in the horeca industry.

Water will flow faster when the handle is in the upright position. The water is aerated which allows the water to come through the spout at a faster rate.

==Water source==
Water dispensed from water coolers may originate from many different sources, but are often classified into two major categories, namely natural mineral and spring water, and purified water.

=== Natural mineral and spring water ===
Natural mineral and spring water are waters emanating from underground geological rock formations collected from boreholes or emerging springs. Legislation in each respective country further differentiates between these two types of water and stipulates strict naming and labeling criteria based on natural source protection, total dissolved solids, and the amount of processing the water may undergo prior to bottling.

=== Purified water ===
Purified water is water from groundwater or municipal water supply and is produced by any one of several methods of purification including reverse osmosis, distillation, deionization, and filtration. The water is often treated by ultraviolet light or ozone for antimicrobial reasons and re-mineralized by injection of soluble inorganic salts.

== Water delivery ==
The delivery of water in a water cooler comes in two main forms, namely bottled variants, or plumbed directly from the main water supply. The water is normally pumped into a water tank to be heated or chilled, depending on the model of the water cooler. Modern versions include hybrid models that are able to utilize both methods.

===Bottled water coolers===

To install the bottle, the bottle is tipped upside down and set onto the dispenser; a probe punctures the cap of the bottle
and allows the water to flow into the machine&#x27;s internal reservoir.
These gravity-powered systems have a device to dispense water in a controlled manner.

These machines come in different sizes and vary from table units, intended for occasional use to floor-mounted units intended for heavier use. Bottled water is normally delivered to households or businesses on a regular basis, where empty returnable polycarbonate bottles are exchanged for full ones. In developing markets, PET is often used for large bottles despite shrinkage and lower washing temperature will lead to making it a more challenging material to use.

The bottle size varies with the size of the unit, with the larger versions in the US using bottles. This is also the most common size elsewhere, labeled as 18.9 liters in countries that use the metric system. Originally, these bottles were manufactured at 3,5 or 6 US gallon capacity (11.4, 18.9 or 22.7 liters) and supplied to rented water cooler units. These units usually do not have a place to dump excess water, only offering a small basin to catch minor spills. On the front, a lever or pushbutton dispenses the water into a cup held beneath the spigot. When the water container is empty, it is lifted off the top of the dispenser, and automatically seals to prevent any excess water still in the bottle from leaking.

==== Material ====
For many years and throughout the 20th century, glass was the main material used for bottling until the evolution of thermoplastics following World War II. PVC evolved as a multi-purpose plastic material and gained mass adoption as an ideal mass production material. Only dark green glass bottles were retained for packaging carbonated waters. The 1980s saw the re-development of PVC bottles due to cost reduction. Advances in manufacturing and materials technology such as new blow and injection molding techniques have reduced the wall thickness and weight of bottles while improving durability and increasing service life.

===Direct plumbed===
Directly plumbed water coolers use tap water and therefore do not need bottles due to their use of the main water supply. Usually, some method of purification is used. Log reduction (e.g. 6-log reduction or 99.9999% effective) is used as a measure on the effectiveness of sanitization and disinfection.

== Purification ==
===Filtration===
Filtration methods include reverse osmosis, ion exchange, and activated carbon. Reverse osmosis works differently from chemical or ultraviolet protection, using a membrane that has fine pores, passing H2O while preventing larger molecules such as salts, carbonates, and other micro-organisms from passing through it. If there is insufficient energy to naturally force the water through the membrane, a powerful pump is required, resulting in potential high energy costs. In addition, RO units are capable of softening water. Some living micro-organisms, including viruses, are capable of passing through an RO unit filter.

Deionizers or demineralizers use resins exchange to remove ions from the stream of water and are most commonly twin-bed or mixed-bed deionizers. It is often used in sterile manufacturing environments such as computer chips, where deionized water is a poor conductor of electricity.

In activated carbon, raw materials such as lignite, coal, bone charcoal, coconut shells, and wood charcoal are used, developing pores during activation when partly burning away carbon layers. In most cases, activated carbon is a single-use material as regeneration is often not possible on-site. Granular activated carbon (GAC) is most commonly used in the filtration of the water cooler. Regular sanitization using hot water and steam is required to limit bacterial growth.

=== Sanitization &amp; disinfection ===
The sanitization of water is defined by the reduction of the number of micro-organisms to a safe level. According to the AOAC suspension test method, a sanitizer should be capable of killing 99.999% of a specific bacterial test population within 30 seconds at 25 °C (77 °F). Sanitizers may or may not necessarily destroy pathogenic or disease-causing bacteria. The sanitizer used must comply with regulations applicable in the geographic location. In the US, sanitizers are regulated by the EPA and FDA, and must pass the AOAC test in the reduction of microbial activity of two standard test organisms (&quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;) from a designated microbial load by a 5-log reduction.

The main difference between a sanitizer and a disinfectant is that at a specific use dilution, the disinfectant must have a higher kill capability for pathogenic bacteria than that of a sanitizer. If these micro-organisms are not destroyed, the bottled water being produced may be contaminated.

UVGI (ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) is a commonly used disinfection method to kill or inactivate micro-organisms and leaving them unable to perform vital cellular functions. Drawbacks to UV light water purifiers include turbidity. If the fluid is unclear, the UV light will not pass through completely, leaving the stream partially sterilized.

==Cooling and heating methods==
===Cooling===
Most modern units offer a refrigeration function to chill the water, using Vapor compression refrigeration or Thermoelectric cooling.

====Vapor compression refrigeration====
Water coolers using vapor compression refrigeration come in one of the following systems:
* Reservoir System - A tank where water is held, to be used for cooling or heating and is fitted with a float mechanism to prevent overflowing.
** Removable Reservoir - a removable reservoir is an open-end tank with cooling coils that come into contact with the external tank surface. It operates on the basis of a modular system, allowing one to easily detach and refill water instead of keeping it in a closed system. One of the advantages in using a removable reservoir is the ease of sanitization. This allows end users to replace the reservoir completely rather than sending an entire water cooler back for servicing. A similar technology can be found in many modern water dispensers and coffee machines.
** Stainless Steel - open end tank with cooling coils that come into contact with the external tank surface
* Pressure Vessel Direct Chill System - The combination of a pressure vessel, which protects the water in the tank from air-borne contamination, and a direct chill system which cools water coming from the mains quickly.
**Pressure Vessel - A sealed pressure vessel is filled at a lower pressure within the water cooler. As such, the water does not come into contact with the atmosphere, allowing a larger amount of cold water (depending on the size of the tank) to be dispensed at the expense of a slower cooling system.
**Direct Chill - In a standard direct chill system, water is passed through a stainless steel coil that is in contact with a copper evaporator that circulates refrigerant gas. The refrigeration system is attached outside of the coil and the cold transfers through the pipe walls to chill the water in the coil through conduction. When the taps are operated, the chilled water is dispensed at mains pressure. The water never comes into contact with the atmosphere as the cold temperature emitted by the refrigerant gas is transferred through the copper coil which transfers the cold temperatures to water passing through the stainless steel coil without touching each other. This allows the water to get cold more quickly again at the expense of having a lower volume of cold water available.
* Ice-bank Cooling System - A pressurized stainless steel coil and a copper coil is immersed in a reservoir full of pre-chilled water. The copper coil containing the refrigerant gas freezes the water contained within the reservoir producing a cold supply, which in turns cools the drinking water flowing through stainless steel coil.

==== Thermoelectric cooling ====
Thermoelectric cooling is a green alternative to HFC refrigerant that uses a solid state device that acts as a heat pump to transfer heat from one side of the device to another using the Peltier effect. It is made up of numerous pairs of semiconductors enclosed by ceramic wafers. Thermoelectric coolers use direct current power rather than refrigerant gas and a compressor and have no moving parts or complex assemblies.

===Heating===
Some versions also have a second dispenser that delivers room-temperature water or even heated water that can be used for tea, hot chocolate or other uses. The water in the alternate hot tap is generally heated with a heating element and stored in a hot tank (much like the traditional hot water heaters used in residential homes). Additionally, the hot tap is usually equipped with a push-in safety valve to prevent burns from an accidental or inadvertent pressing of the lever.

== Additional features ==
=== Bottle filler ===
Newer variants of water coolers include an additional dispenser designed to fill water bottles directly on wall-mounted units. This is increasingly common in public water coolers as they have also been spotted in public places such as airports and railway stations. These bottle filling units also can indicate the number of single-use plastic bottles saved as part of an ongoing public effort to reduce plastic pollution.

=== Carbonation ===
Modern variants of water coolers have been equipped with options for sparkling water as a result of increasing demand for carbonated beverages and also a greater awareness to healthy living, resulting in preference for carbonated water over sweetened carbonated beverages. This works with the addition of a mixer tank filled with compressed CO2 located inside the cooling tank. This brings the temperature of the CO2 gas down to the temperature of the cooling tank. As carbonated water is dispensed, the mixer tank is automatically refilled with cold water and carbon dioxide, ensuring a continuous supply of carbonated water is readily available.

== Maintenance ==
All bottled water coolers need to be periodically cleaned to prevent mineral build-up inside the heating tank, also known as scaling. The frequency of the cleaning can be determined by the concentration of the minerals and the amount of water used. Descaling agents such as citric acid can be used for this cleaning process.

Heating tanks will require cleaning when normal hot water flow appears to be restricted or when noisy heating cycles can be heard during operation. Additional symptoms include water coming from the cooling tank is very warm as well as a change of taste in the water resulting from mineral build-up.

<text>The Seattle Metropolitans were a professional ice hockey team based in Seattle, playing in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) from 1915 to 1924. During their nine seasons, the Metropolitans were the PCHA&#x27;s most successful franchise, as they went 112–96–2 in their nine years as a franchise (outpacing the next best team in the Vancouver Millionaires, who went 109–97–2 during that same period). The Metropolitans also won the most regular season PCHA championships, winning five times (while Vancouver won four), with Seattle finishing second on three other occasions. The Metropolitans played their home games at the 2,500 seat Seattle Ice Arena located downtown at 5th and University.

The Metropolitans made seven postseason appearances in their nine seasons. The team won the Stanley Cup in 1917, tied for the Cup in 1919 and lost in five games in 1920. The story of the Metropolitans&#x27; 1917 championship, which made Seattle the first American team to win the Cup, was chronicled in the book &quot;When It Mattered Most&quot;. Seattle&#x27;s Stanley Cup championship occurred 11 years before the New York Rangers became the National Hockey League&#x27;s first American franchise to win the Cup in 1928.

The Metropolitans folded in 1924 when a replacement for the Seattle Ice Arena could not be found. Seattle&#x27;s next team eligible to win the Stanley Cup, the NHL expansion Seattle Kraken, began play in 2021, and have honored the Metropolitans in various ways since.

==History==

The Metropolitans were formed in 1915 as an expansion team by Frank and Lester Patrick, the owners of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association. The team&#x27;s name was derived from the Metropolitan Building Company, the entity that built the Seattle Ice Arena on the University of Washington&#x27;s Metropolitan Tract property.

A long simmering player war between the NHA and PCHA exploded once again in 1915 when the Patricks caught the Ottawa Senators trying to poach Vancouver&#x27;s best player, Cyclone Taylor. In response, the Patricks raided the Toronto Blueshirts, signing Eddie Carpenter, Frank Foyston, Hap Holmes, Jack Walker and Cully Wilson for the Metropolitans. The Blueshirts had won the Stanley Cup in 1914 and this immediately provided Seattle with a competitive squad. To complete the roster, Pete Muldoon signed forward Bobby Rowe and offered a tryout to center Bernie Morris who had both been reserves the previous season in Victoria and cut by the team that summer. Muldoon immediately moved Rowe to defense, where he thrived, and Morris quickly made the team, scoring the game-winning goal in the Metropolitans&#x27; first game and eventually becoming a 5-time PCHA All-Star. Roy Rickey was signed a few weeks into the inaugural season after he was released by Vancouver. The Metropolitans signed Jim Riley just prior to the 1916–17 season after he, too, was cut by Victoria.

In an era of one-year contracts and rampant player movement, the Metropolitans roster remained relatively stable. With a typical roster of nine skaters, the Metropolitans had seven players spend seven or more seasons in Seattle. Foyston, Walker and Rowe played all nine campaigns while Morris, Holmes and Rickey spent eight years with the Metropolitans and Jim Riley seven, missing 1918 while serving overseas in World War I.

The team&#x27;s official scorer was Royal Brougham, who covered the Metropolitans, Sonics, Seahawks and Mariners during his 68-year career at the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;.

===First U.S. Stanley Cup===

Seattle won the 1917 championship by defeating the National Hockey Association&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens three games to one by a combined score of 23–11. The heavily favored Canadiens trounced the Metropolitans in Game 1, despite arriving in Seattle the same morning. The Metropolitans would storm back to win Games 2, 3, and 4, outscoring Montreal 19–3. Fourteen of Seattle&#x27;s goals were scored by Bernie Morris (including six in Game 4 alone). Games 1 and 3 were played under PCHA rules, including seven players per side, forward passing in the neutral zone, and no substitution for penalized players. Games 2 and 4 were played under NHA rules, including six players per side, no forward passing, and substitutions allowed.

===Later years===
After winning the 1917 Stanley Cup, the Metropolitans also played in the Stanley Cup Finals in 1919 (which was cancelled due to the Spanish flu pandemic after five games, with the series tied 2–2–1) and 1920, when they lost to the Ottawa Senators.

The day the 1919 playoffs began, star center Bernie Morris was arrested and jailed at Fort Lewis for draft evasion, despite being a Canadian citizen. Without their best scorer, the Metropolitans still defeated the Vancouver Millionaires in the PCHA championship series and jumped out to a 2-1 lead through Game three of the Stanley Cup Finals, outscoring Montreal 16–6 as Seattle&#x27;s best player, Frank Foyston, scored eight goals. Game 4 of the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals resulted in a scoreless tie after two overtime periods. The Metropolitans&#x27; Cully Wilson netted the lone puck on the night only to have it waved off by referee Mickey Ion, who ruled that time had expired before the goal scored. The Metropolitans jumped out to a 4–1 lead in the third period of Game 5 before exhaustion consumed the short-handed Metropolitans. Montreal scored three goals in the final period to tie the game and force a second consecutive overtime match. With Frank Foyston injured in the period and Jack Walker out with a broken skate, Cully Wilson collapsed on the ice as the Canadiens scored the game winner to send the series to an unprecedented sixth game. The next morning, the Spanish flu pandemic struck the two teams, ultimately killing Montreal&#x27;s Joe Hall and hospitalizing four other Canadiens. Unable to field a team, Montreal offered to forfeit the Cup. The offer was declined by Frank Patrick and Pete Muldoon, who felt championships should be won on the ice.

During the 1920 Stanley Cup Finals, the Ottawa Senators wore solid white uniforms to avoid confusion with Seattle&#x27;s barber pole style of green, red and white. Games 4 and 5 of the series were relocated from Ottawa to Toronto&#x27;s Mutual Street Arena due to poor ice conditions.

The PCHA consisted of four teams for the 1915–16 and 1916–17 seasons, while operating under only three teams from 1917–18 until its final season in 1923–24. From 1922–23, games against the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) counted in the PCHA standings. This allowed Seattle to have a losing record yet still win the league regular season championship in 1924. After the season, the owners of the newly built Olympic Hotel told the University that they needed the Seattle Ice Arena as a parking garage. The UW bought out the final year on the team&#x27;s lease, sending the franchise&#x27;s leadership scrambling to secure funding to build a new arena. When it became apparent they would not succeed, the Metropolitans folded with the core of the team joining Victoria. Vancouver and Victoria joined the WCHL for the 1924–25 season with the Portland franchise playing the final western season of 1925–26.

=== Tributes ===
Seattle&#x27;s later hockey teams have paid tribute to the Metropolitans. The National Hockey League owns the rights to the Metropolitans&#x27; trademarks in Canada. Paul Kim, an entrepreneur in Lynnwood, Washington, acquired the trademarks in the U.S. in 2016, after the prior owner abandoned them. Kim had intended to license the trademarks to a future NHL franchise in Seattle.
On December 5, 2015, the Seattle Thunderbirds held a special &quot;Seattle Metropolitans Night&quot; to celebrate 100 years of Seattle hockey. During the game, the team wore replicas of the original Metropolitans jersey and temporarily changed the team name to the Seattle Metropolitans. The final score was a 3–2 Metropolitans win over the Tri-City Americans.

The Seattle Jr. Totems of the Western States Hockey League named November 15–17, 2019, as &quot;Seattle Hockey History Weekend&quot; and wore the Metropolitans&#x27; colors during games.

The &quot;S&quot; logo of the NHL&#x27;s Seattle Kraken was designed as an homage to the Metropolitans. On October 26, 2021, the Kraken raised a 1917 Stanley Cup Championship banner at Climate Pledge Arena before the team&#x27;s game against the Canadiens. It was Montreal&#x27;s first non-exhibition game in Seattle since the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals, which were not completed due to the Spanish flu pandemic. The Kraken&#x27;s uniforms for the 2024 NHL Winter Classic feature a &quot;barber-pole&quot; stripe pattern inspired by the Metropolitans&#x27; uniforms.

<text>The Australia men&#x27;s national rugby union team, nicknamed the Wallabies, is the representative men&#x27;s national team in the sport of rugby union for the nation of Australia. The team first played at Sydney in 1899, winning their first test match against the touring British Isles team.

Australia has competed in all ten Men&#x27;s Rugby World Cups, winning the final on two occasions and also finishing as runner-up twice. Australia beat England at Twickenham in the final of the 1991 Rugby World Cup and won again in 1999 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff when their opponents in the final were France.

The Wallabies also compete annually in The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri-Nations), along with southern hemisphere counterparts Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa. They have won this championship on four occasions. Australia also plays test matches against the various rugby-playing nations.

More than a dozen former Wallabies players have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.

==History==
===Early years===

Australia&#x27;s first international match was played against the touring British Isles team in 1899. The first test was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground and won 13–3 by Australia, but the tourists won the remaining three tests. The Australian team for the first match consisted of six players from Queensland and nine from New South Wales. The team wore the blue of New South Wales when playing in Sydney and the maroon of Queensland when playing in Brisbane, but with an Australian Coat of Arms in place of the usual emblems of each colony.

The first Test between Australia and was played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1903, with New Zealand winning 22–3. This tour improved rugby&#x27;s popularity in Sydney and Brisbane and helped to boost club match attendances.
In 1907 the New South Wales Rugby League was formed and star player Dally Messenger left rugby union for the rival code. The next year the first Australian rugby team to tour the British Isles left Sydney. Newspapers in England initially gave the team the name &#x27;Rabbits&#x27;. The Australian players thought this nickname derogatory and replaced it with &#x27;Wallabies&#x27;.

In 1909, when the new &quot;Northern Union&quot; code was still in its infancy in Australia, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the Rugby League side winning 29–26.

The First World War had a very negative effect on rugby union in Australia. All rugby union competitions in New South Wales and Queensland ceased after the state bodies decided it was inappropriate to play football when so many young men were fighting overseas. The sport of rugby union was all but closed down causing many players to switch to rugby league – which did not cease playing during the war.

In Queensland regular competitions did not commence again until 1929, and there was no official Australian team selected through most of the 1920s before the 1929 All Blacks tour. The New South Wales Waratahs were re-formed in 1920, however, and played regularly throughout the decade including a series of matches against New Zealand and before their 1927–28 tour of the British Isles, France and Canada. Because these Waratahs teams were Australia&#x27;s only representatives at the time, all international matches they played during this period were accorded retrospective Wallaby status.

War hero Sir Edward &quot;Weary&quot; Dunlop also played for Australia before World War II. He played on the side that was the first to win the Bledisloe Cup.

===Post-war: 1946–1959===
The first Test to following World War Two was played at Carisbrook, Dunedin between Australia and New Zealand in 1946, which New Zealand won 31–8. Australia did not win on the three match tour; beaten 20–0 by New Zealand Maori, and then losing 14–10 to the All Blacks the following week. Australia embarked on a tour of the home nations in 1947–48. The successful tour fell short of an undefeated run when the Australians lost to France in their last match, in Paris. Players on the rise included Trevor Allan, Cyril Burke and Nicholas Shehadie.

After returning from the successful European tour, Australia hosted the New Zealand Maori in a three match series in 1949; both sides winning once, with one draw. In September of that year, Australia played the All Blacks twice in New Zealand, winning both games and taking back the Bledisloe Cup for the first time on New Zealand soil. The &#x27;Number 1&#x27; All Black side was touring South Africa at the time and the wins by Australia against the B-team have sometimes been downgraded. However, in deference to the apartheid system then in operation in South Africa, the NZRU did not select any Maori players for the tour. Many of those regular All Black Maori played against Australia instead and it could be said that the New Zealand team that played Australia was at least as good as the one on tour in South Africa. The British Isles toured Australia in 1950, and won both of the Tests against Australia. The following year Australia fell to a three Test whitewash to the All Blacks. Australia won in July 1952, defeating at the Sydney Cricket Ground – they then lost the second Test to Fiji by two points. Australia managed to beat the All Blacks at Lancaster Park after the Fijian series; however they lost the second Test.

On this tour they also drew against Rhodesia in Kitwe 8–8.

===1960s===
The first match of the new decade was the win over Fiji at the SCG in the first match of a three Test series during 1961. This was followed by a second win, but Fiji grabbed a draw in the third Test. Australia then headed to South Africa, where they lost to the Springboks in Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg. After returning home, they faced France at the SCG, who beat them 15–8.

In 1962, Australia played the All Blacks five times and lost all but a 9–9 draw at Athletic Park. After defeating 18–9 in 1963 in Sydney, Australia beat the Springboks in consecutive Tests in South Africa; the first team to do so since the 1896 British team.

Fewer tests were played throughout the mid-1960s, with Australia only playing a three Test series against All Blacks in 1964. They won the third Test after losing the first two. The following year Australia hosted the Springboks for two Tests, winning 18–11 and 12–8. This was their first ever series win over South Africa and first over a major nation since 1934.

The British Isles came the following year, beating Australia 11–8 at the SCG, before hammering them 31–0 in Brisbane. Australia left for Europe in that December where a 14–11 victory over Wales was followed by a slim 11–5 defeat of Scotland. The tour continued into the following year where Australia beat England 23–11 before losing to Ireland 15–8 and France 20–14. Australia then hosted Ireland, who beat them again in Sydney. This was followed by a 20-point loss to the All Blacks. The following year, Australia lost to the All Blacks by just one point after a dubious penalty try. Later that year they defeated France for the first time by the same margin from a long drop goal by John Ballesty for their last win of the decade. After losing to Ireland and Scotland on tour, Australia hosted Wales who also beat them.

===1970s===
Australia played Scotland in 1970 and won by 20 points. The 1971 South African tour of Australia took place the next season. Protests were held around Australia and in Queensland a state of emergency was issued in advance of one of the Tests. Australia toured France in November of that year; defeating France in Toulouse, but losing the second Test in Paris. France then visited Australia in June 1972 and played a two Test series where they won one and drew one. Australia then played three Test series against the All Blacks in New Zealand—losing all three. They then stopped over in Suva to play Fiji on their return, where they won their only Test of the year.

The following year, Australia hosted Tonga, and after winning the first Test, they lost 11–16 at Ballymore in their second. Australia also had a short tour of the United Kingdom in November 1973 where they lost 24–0 to Wales, and 20–3 to England. In 1974, Australia hosted the All Blacks for a three Test series—losing two, but drawing in Brisbane.

In 1974, former Wallaby Dick Marks was appointed as the inaugural National Director of Coaching, commencing a period of systematic improvement of Australian rugby coach and player development under the National Coaching Scheme. A turn around in performance of the national side soon followed, leading to outstanding international successes through the 1980s and 1990s.

In 1975 Australia defeated England in a two Test series at home. Australia then played Japan for the first time; beating them by 30 points in the first of two matches, and then winning 50–25 in the second. They then travelled to the Northern hemisphere for matches against Scotland and Wales where they were not able to score a try in either of their losses. The tour of Britain and Ireland continued into 1976, and Australia lost to England at Twickenham, but were able to defeat Ireland at Lansdowne Road. On their way home Australia played one more match—in Los Angeles against the United States. Australia won 24–12. In June of that year, Australia hosted Fiji for a three Test series and won all three. Australia finished the year with their tour of Europe where the team played two Tests against France in France, but lost both of them. There were no Wallaby tests played in 1977.

Wales toured Australia in 1978, and Australia beat them 18–8 at Ballymore, and then again by two points at the SCG. This was followed by a three match series with the All Blacks. Although New Zealand won the first two, Australia defeated them in the last Test at Eden Park with Greg Cornelsen scoring four tries. The following year Ireland visited Australia and defeated Australia in two Tests. Following this Australia hosted the All Blacks for a single Test at the SCG which Australia won 12–6. Australia then left for Argentina for two Tests. After going down 24–13 in the first, Australia finished the decade by beating Argentina 17–12 in Buenos Aires.

===1980s===
In 1980 Australia won the Bledisloe Cup for only the fourth time—defeating New Zealand 2–1 in a three match series in Australia. This was the start of a successful era for Australia. In 1984 Australia toured the Home nations with a young side and new coach Alan Jones. The 1984 Wallabies became the first team from Australia to achieve a Grand Slam by defeating all four Home Nations: England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland, and a strong Barbarians side. The tour signalled the emergence of Australia as a serious force on the world stage. Many records were established on the tour including; 100 points being scored in the four Tests—the most scored by a touring team to the United Kingdom and Ireland, the first ever push-over try conceded by Wales in Cardiff, Mark Ella scoring a try in each match – a feat never before achieved.
In 1986 Australia toured New Zealand in a three match series for the Bledisloe Cup. New Zealand rugby was in turmoil as an unofficial team named The Cavaliers that contained the bulk of the All Blacks players toured South Africa. On return those All Blacks who had toured with The Cavaliers were banned from selection for the first Bledisloe Test. Australia went on to win the first match by 13–12. The ban on players was lifted for the second Test which was played on 23 August 1986 at Carisbrook. New Zealand squared the series 1–1 by winning the match 13–12. The match included controversy when Welsh referee Derek Bevan disallowed a try by Australia number eight Steve Tuynman. The final match was played on 6 September 1986 at Eden Park. Australia beat a full strength New Zealand team 22–9 to secure their first series win on New Zealand soil.

Australia went into the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 confident. However, the semi-final against France at Sydney&#x27;s Concord Oval, was lost 30–26. Australia then lost the 3rd/4th play-off match against Wales. While Australia&#x27;s performances over the three years under coach Alan Jones were of a high standard, Jones had a polarising effect on the team with many players unhappy with his management style. Mark Ella, who retired after the 1984 season, stated that he might not have retired had Jones not been coach. Notably, there were deep ructions between coach Alan Jones and influential half-back Nick Farr-Jones. Before and during the 1987 World Cup Alan Jones increased his activities outside coaching Australia, including radio broadcasting. Following the World Cup Jones was removed as coach and Bob Dwyer—who had coached Australia in 1982 and 1983—returned to coach in 1988.

In 1989 the British Lions toured Australia for the first time since 1966. After winning the first Test, Australia lost the second and third matches to lose the series 2–1. Bob Dwyer identified a lack of forward dominance as a major factor contributing to the loss and entered the 1990s with an aim to improve this facet of the Wallaby game.

John Moulton was the Wallabies team doctor during the 1986 Bledisloe Cup win in New Zealand and the Rugby World Cup in 1987 and the Rugby World Cup victory in 1991.

===1990s===
The team regrouped and then went into the 1991 World Cup with a renewed attitude. In the pool games they beat Argentina, cruised to a 38–3 win over Wales, and beat Samoa 9–3 in a rain soaked game. During the quarter-final match against Ireland, Australia were never able to pull away from them. With literally seconds remaining on the clock, Ireland were up 18–15 before Michael Lynagh scored in the corner to break the hearts of the Irish and qualify for the semi-final against New Zealand. In the first half they raced to a 13–3 lead and then showed they could defend as the All Blacks pounded their line. They faced England in the final at Twickenham. England changed their usually forward-dominated game plan and attempted to play more of a running game. It was unsuccessful and Australia battled out a 12–6 win. David Campese was named player of the tournament having scored six tries in a series of outstanding performances. Victory parades were held back in Australia for their national team.

The decade was one of the most important in the creation of the modern game. Australia&#x27;s defence of the World Cup in South Africa in 1995 opened with defeat by the home side. Pool play was followed by an exit in the quarter-final against England courtesy of a long-range drop-goal from the boot of Rob Andrew. This was Australia&#x27;s second worst World Cup result, on a par with Australia&#x27;s unexpected exit from the 2007 campaign at the quarter-final stage, also against England. The Tri-Nations and Super 12 tournaments were established that year, and started in 1996. This pushed the game into professionalism. In response to rugby&#x27;s move to professionalism, the Rugby Union Players Association (RUPA) was established in October 1995 to safeguard the interests of Australia&#x27;s professional rugby players.

Greg Smith was national coach in 1996 and 1997 when Australia only won two of their eight Tri-Nations Tests, both over South Africa in Australia, and suffered record-margin Test defeats by the All Blacks and Springboks. Rod Macqueen was appointed as Smith&#x27;s successor and in 1998 Australia won both their Tests over the All Blacks to gain the Bledisloe Cup. They retained the Bledisloe in 1999 when they defeated the All Blacks by a record 28–7 in Sydney.

In the 1999 World Cup Australia won their pool and conceded only 31 points before facing Wales in their quarter-final. They won 24–9 before winning the semi-final 27–21 against defending champions South Africa. The semi-final was won after a memorable drop goal in extra time by fly-half Stephen Larkham (his first drop goal scored in a Test match). The final against France at Millennium Stadium was easily won by 35–12; with the majority of points courtesy of fullback and goal-kicker Matt Burke.

In 1999, five Australian players won their second Rugby World Cup: Phil Kearns, John Eales, Tim Horan, Jason Little and Dan Crowley.

===2000s===

In 2000 Australia retained the Bledisloe Cup, and won the Tri Nations for the first time. They repeated this in 2001 and also achieved their first ever series win over the British &amp; Irish Lions. MacQueen, and captain John Eales both retired soon after this. They were replaced by coach Eddie Jones and captain George Gregan. This period also saw big-money signings of top-level rugby league footballers Mat Rogers, Wendell Sailor, and Lote Tuqiri—all of whom went on to represent Australia. This was a contrast to much of the previous century where many Rugby union players were lured to league with large salaries.

After not retaining the Tri-Nations in 2002, and losing the Bledisloe Cup in 2003 Australia made a strong start to their 2003 World Cup campaign with a 24–8 win over Argentina, and two large victories over Namibia and Romania. They then narrowly defeated Ireland 17–16 and Scotland 33–16, in the quarter-final. They claimed one of their greatest victories over New Zealand when they upset them in the semi-final winning 22–10, prompting George Gregan to taunt the New Zealanders with the words &quot;Four more years boys, four more years&quot;. They played England in a thrilling final and were finally beaten after England&#x27;s Jonny Wilkinson kicked a drop goal in extra time.

In 2005 to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the professionalism of rugby union the Wallaby Team of the Decade was announced. John Eales being named captain by a selection panel of 30. Following the 2005 European tour, media outlets such as the Daily Telegraph called for the sacking of both Eddie Jones and George Gregan. Former coach Alan Jones also called for their sacking. The record of eight losses from their last nine Tests resulted in Jones being fired by the Australian Rugby Union.

John Connolly was named as the head coach of Australia in early 2006. Australia won both of two Tests against England in 2006, as well as a subsequent win over Ireland. Australia lost by 20 points in their opening Tri-Nations fixture against the All Blacks. They then beat South Africa in Brisbane by 49–0. They won one of their remaining four matches of the tournament. Following defeat by England in the quarter-finals of the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Connolly announced he was resigning as head coach.

Robbie Deans was appointed head coach in early 2008 as the Wallabies began their preparations for the 2008 Tri-Nations series. After the retirement of George Gregan and Stephen Larkham after the 2007 Rugby World Cup, Deans had the task of choosing a squad minus some of its most experienced players. The Wallabies had mixed results in the 2008 Tri Nations Series, defeating New Zealand in Sydney and beating South Africa twice, in both Perth and Durban. However, the Wallabies suffered the worst defeat in their history, going down 53–8 to South Africa in Johannesburg.

2009 was not a good year for the Wallabies. It was a good start for them as they defeated the Barbarians 55–7 and then beat in both tests and finishing off the Mid year test series with a 22–6 win over . It went downhill from there as they finished 3rd in the Tri Nations with three losses to the All Blacks (22–16, 19–18 and 33–6) and two losses to the World Champion Springboks (29–17 and 32–25). Their only win in the Tri Nations was a 21–6 win over South Africa. In the Autumn Internationals of 2009, they lost to New Zealand 32–19, they beat England 18–9 on Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s return in the English jersey. The Wallabies then drew with Ireland 20–20 after Brian O&#x27;Driscoll&#x27;s last minute try to give Ronan O&#x27;Gara a relatively easy conversion to draw level. They then lost to Scotland for the first time in 27 years. The final score was 9–8 despite the 3–3 score at half time. The Wallabies only won 7 out of their 14 games in 2009 but were still ranked 3rd in the world.

===2010s===

2010 saw improved results in the Tri Nations series, with a very rare away win against awarding Australia the Mandela Plate and ensuring they retained second place both in the 2010 Tri Nations competition as well as the IRB World Rankings. However, they suffered their tenth consecutive defeat at the hands of , an all-time record. Later that year however, Australia finally beat the All Blacks in a thrilling game that was played in Hong Kong. It was their first win against New Zealand in close to three years. However they suffered losses against and Munster on their end of year European tour.

Australia&#x27;s 2011 season began with a shock loss to in Sydney, (23–32) but they would go on to win that year&#x27;s Tri Nations series; a tournament which they had not won since 2001. They however failed the following season in their attempt to win the expanded version of the competition in 2012 called The Rugby Championship.

Australia also won their first match against in the 2011 Rugby World Cup, but lost their second 2011 World Cup match, 6–15 against . Injuries to crucial players Digby Ioane and Stephen Moore influenced the results, alongside poor line-out throwing. In their third Pool C match, against the , the Wallabies eventually won 67–5, with Rob Horne, Rocky Elsom, Kurtley Beale, Drew Mitchell, Pat McCabe and Radike Samo all scoring a try, while Anthony Fainga&#x27;a scored two tries and Adam Ashley-Cooper scored three. The Wallabies won their last pool match against , 68–22. The Wallabies beat the Springboks 11–9 to progress into the semi-finals. However a week later the Wallabies were knocked out of the 2011 World Cup after being defeated 6–20 by the All Blacks in the second semi-final match. They then faced in the bronze medal final, narrowly winning 18–21.

Following the Wallabies&#x27; defeat to the British &amp; Irish Lions in their 2013 tour, and with a winning rate of 58.1%, a poor 3–15 record against the All Blacks, Deans came under increasing pressure to keep his coaching position.
Deans resigned in July 2013, ending his six-year tenure as head coach of the Wallabies. During his tenure, Deans coached the Wallabies on 74 occasions winning 43 times, losing 29 and drawing twice. He had won just three times against their main rivals, the All Blacks, with one draw in 2012. However, he left with a good record against the Springboks, with 9 wins from 14. Highlights during his tenure as coach included leading the Wallabies to a Tri Nations championship in 2011 and to a 3rd-place finish in the 2011 Rugby World Cup.

On 9 July 2013, Queensland Reds coach Ewen McKenzie was officially named Wallabies coach to replace Robbie Deans.
McKenzie&#x27;s first match in charge was a 47–29 loss to New Zealand in the opening fixture of the 2013 Rugby Championship. In this match he gave five debutants their first cap. The 27–16 loss a week later, meant the Bledisloe Cup would stay with New Zealand for the 11th year in a row. In addition to this, McKenzie led to team to a 38–12 loss to South Africa, the biggest ever winning margin by South Africa over Australia in Australia. The 14–13 win over was McKenzie&#x27;s first victory as an international coach, but the scoreless second half was the first time Australia had failed to score points in the second half since the home test v New Zealand in 2005. Australia&#x27;s poor form in the Championship continued against South Africa, where Australia lost 28–8 in Cape Town. However, Australia&#x27;s final fixture of the Championship saw the Wallabies earn their first bonus point win in the Championship and saw them score the most points in either the Rugby Championship / Tri Nations. During the Championship, McKenzie made several bold moves as a coach. He dropped star player Will Genia for Nic White, who at the time had only three caps, and named Ben Mowen as captain in his first year as a test player.

During the Bledisloe 3, New Zealand won 41–33 to win the Bledisloe series 3–0. During their 2013 end of year tour, McKenzie led the team to four consecutive wins (50–20 win over Italy, 32–15 win over Ireland, 21–15 win over Scotland and a 30–26 win over Wales) which was the first time Australia has done this since 2008. But Australia lost 20–13 to England in the opening match of the tour. However, during the tour Australia did retain the Lansdowne Cup, reclaimed the Hopetoun Cup and claimed the James Bevan Trophy for the 6th time in a row.

In 2014, their four consecutive wins were increased to seven for the first time since 2000. They earned a 3–0 test series win over during the June International Window, which included a 50–23 win in Brisbane, a 6–0 win in Melbourne and a 39–13 win in Sydney. The series win meant Australia reclaimed the Trophée des Bicentenaires for the first time since 2010, after losing it in 2012. The Wallabies&#x27; unbeaten run stretched to eight matches with a 12–12 draw with New Zealand, prompting optimism that Australia could finally reclaim the Bledisloe Cup for the first time since 2002, in addition to ending their 28-year winless run at Eden Park. However, Australia came crashing back to earth, suffering a 51–20 defeat during the second Bledisloe test, staged at the venue, stretching Australia&#x27;s Bledisloe Cup drought to a 12th year. Australia managed to bounce back from that defeat, with hard fought 24–23 and 32–25 wins over South Africa and Argentina, with the latter win ensuring that Australia retained the Puma Trophy. However, Australia was unable to reclaim the Mandela Challenge Plate, suffering a 28–11 loss to South Africa, after conceding three tries and a drop goal in the final 11 minutes of the match. A week later, Australia suffered a 21–17 loss to Argentina, their first loss to Argentina in 17 years. This loss meant that Australia became the first country to lose to Argentina in the Rugby Championship since Argentina&#x27;s admittance in 2012. For the second consecutive year, Australia finished in third place in the Rugby Championship. On 18 October 2014, McKenzie resigned as the head coach of Australia. He left the Wallabies with 11 wins in 22 tests coached, for a winning percentage of just 50%. McKenzie left with a good winning record against European opposition, winning seven of eight tests played, the sole loss coming against England in November 2013. He also left with a good winning record against Argentina, with a 3–1 win–loss record. However, he left with a poor record against Rugby Championship opponents, failing to win a match against New Zealand and leaving with a 1–3 win–loss record against South Africa. On 22 October 2014, New South Wales Waratahs head coach Michael Cheika was appointed the new head coach of Australia, becoming Australia&#x27;s third head coach in two years. In his first match as coach of Australia, Australia defeated the Barbarians 40–36 at Twickenham Stadium. On the 2014 end of year tour, Australia defeated Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff 33–28, delivering the Wallabies a 10th straight victory over the hosts in Michael Cheika&#x27;s first Test as coach. The Wallabies, though, were outscored by four tries to three, with fly-half Bernard Foley kicking a late drop goal and three second-half penalties. The Wallabies lost the other three test matches on the tour against France, Ireland and England which dropped them to sixth place on the world rankings.

2015 was a good year for the Wallabies, they won the Rugby Championship defeating South Africa (24-20), Argentina (9-34) and New Zealand (27-19). They failed to claim the Bledisloe Cup, however losing to their Trans-Tasman rivals the following week in Auckland 41-13. Then it was time for the Rugby World Cup. Australia was in &quot;the pool of death&quot; alongside Wales, Fiji, England and Uruguay. The Wallabies first match was against Fiji which Australia won 28–13. Then Australia slaughtered Uruguay 65–3. In the third round Australia defeated England at Twickenham 33–13, eliminating the host nation from their own World Cup. In the last pool match Australia luckily defeated Wales 15–6. In the quarter-finals they scraped a &quot;controversial&quot; win over Scotland by 35–34. They then defeated Argentina in the semi-finals which took them to the Grand Final against New Zealand, which they lost 34–17.

2016 went badly for the Wallabies, the beginning of a severe downward trend in their results. In June the Australians hosted a three-test series against Six Nations winners England, coached by former Wallabies overseer Eddie Jones. England won all three games, by 39–28, 23–7 and 44–40 respectively. Although they finally finished in 2nd place, with two wins over Argentina and one over South Africa, they lost both games against New Zealand in the Rugby Championship plus the third Bledisloe test that year, continuing a miserable run against their trans-Tasman rivals. In the end of year internationals, Australia managed wins against Wales (32–8), Scotland (23–22) and France (25–23), but lost to Ireland 27–24 before losing a fourth game against England by 37–21.

2017 saw little improvement. In the 2017 June internationals Australia secured wins against Fiji (37–14) and Italy (40–27), but lost against a Scotland side missing a number of players on duty for the British &amp; Irish Lions. Their form continued into the 2017 Rugby Championship where, despite again finishing 2nd in the table, they only won their two games against Argentina, lost both matches against New Zealand and struggled to two draws against a poor South Africa. Although they pulled off a surprise 23–18 win in the third Bledisloe test that year, in their autumn test season they only achieved wins against Japan (63–30) and Wales (29–21) before suffering a fifth straight defeat to England 30–6 and a crushing, record-setting loss to Scotland by 53–24.

2018 was one of the worst years ever for Australian rugby. In the June series against Ireland, Australia won the first test 18–9, but lost the remaining matches 21–26 and 20–16 despite outscoring the Six Nations Grand Slam holders by five tries to three. The home series loss to Ireland was Australia&#x27;s first since 1979. In that year&#x27;s Rugby Championship Australia again lost both matches against arch-rivals New Zealand. Although they secured a hard-fought 23–18 victory against South Africa in Round 2, they subsequently lost to Argentina at home for the first time since 1983, as well as the return fixture to South Africa 23–12. Their third win of the year was against Argentina where, despite losing the first half 31–7, the Wallabies pulled off an astonishing second-half comeback to win the match 45–34. In the final Bledisloe test, played at Yokohama stadium in Japan, the Wallabies were again trounced by New Zealand 37–20. That autumn, Australia suffered their first defeat to Wales in 10 years by 9–6. The scoreline of the Welsh game, as well as the result, exactly mirrored that of the first meeting between the sides 110 years earlier. They defeated Italy 26–7 the following week, before falling to a sixth defeat in a row to England by 37–18 the week after. The Wallabies finished 2018 having won only four games from thirteen tests played, marking that year as their direst run of results in the professional era, and their worst calendar year since 1958.

2019 saw some improvement from the previous year. Despite losing to South Africa 35-17 in Johannesburg, they defeated Argentina 16-10, and then Australia surprised New Zealand with a thumping 47–26 win in Perth, equalling the largest margin of defeat for the All Blacks in a test match, tied with Australia&#x27;s 28–7 victory in 1999. New Zealand reversed the result in the return match in Auckland, however, with a comprehensive 36–0 win to retain the Bledisloe Cup. At the 2019 Rugby World Cup Australia won three of their four pool matches, but a close loss to Wales led to a quarter-final fixture with England. Yet another defeat to the English, by 40–16, ended the Australian campaign and the following day Cheika announced that he would resign as head coach by the end of the year. His contract had been due to expire following the World Cup. The Wallabies ended the decade placed 6th in the international rankings, a fall of 3 places from the beginning of the 2010s.

=== 2020s ===
2020 saw mixed results. Cheika was replaced by Dave Rennie as head coach and due to the COVID-19 pandemic the 2020 Super Rugby season was suspended after only 1 month of playing. This forced the cancellation of many fixtures against northern hemisphere teams, limiting Australia to playing New Zealand and Argentina in a reverted Tri-Nations outfit. In the first match of the Bledisloe Cup in Wellington, Australia tied 16–16 with New Zealand, the closest they had come to winning a match in New Zealand for 20 years. Critics praised Rennie for his replacement of departed players such as Will Genia and Kurtley Beale. However, they criticised utility back Reece Hodge for missing a 50-metre penalty goal to win the match. In the second match, New Zealand played a tougher game, with Australia having to try to break their 35-year drought at Eden Park. They were outclassed 27-7 despite being 3 points down at halftime. The third leg played in Sydney was a horror match, with the Wallabies going down 43–5 to the Kiwis, a record loss and the largest win in Bledisloe Cup history. Australia next played New Zealand at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, where they finally notched a 24–22 win, thanks to debutant winger Tom Wright scoring in the first 10 minutes. They next played Argentina, where they drew 15-all and Hodge once again missed a penalty goal to seal the match. They played the Los Pumas once more, and the result was the same result as Wellington, a 16-all draw. The Wallabies finished 2020 by bumping up to sixth in the world rankings behind Ireland.

2021 brought both highs and lows. The July internationals series saw France touring Australia, and as Sydney went into lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first 2021 test was rescheduled to be played at Suncorp Stadium. The Wallabies opened with a 23—21 win, leapfrogging both France and Wales up to fifth in the world rankings, and the Les Bleus responded with a 28—26 win at AAMI Park in Melbourne, their first win in Australia since 1990. Play returned to Suncorp Stadium for the decider with the cumulative scores of the first two games 49—49. With 5 minutes remaining and the scores tied at 30-all, the series was on a knife&#x27;s edge, but the final points were notched up with a penalty kick by Noah Lolesio, giving a 33—30 win and series win to the Wallabies. The massive challenge of back-to-back games at Eden Park for the Bledisloe Cup brought two losses, 25—33 for the first game, and a heavy 22—57 defeat in the opening Rugby Championship match. With New Zealand having already secured the cup for the 19th consecutive year, the All Blacks remained undefeated in the 2021 Bledisloe series as the Wallabies again went down 21—38 in Perth. However, things started to improve for the Wallabies for the rest of the Rugby Championship. Quade Cooper made a much-anticipated return to the Wallabies against South Africa at fly-half and produced a stellar performance, leading the Wallabies to a 28—26 win after kicking 8 from 8 off the tee. Australia followed this up with an even more convincing 30—17 win over the Springboks, launching them to third in world rankings behind the world champions South Africa, and New Zealand. Back-to-back wins against Argentina put the Wallabies second on the final table behind the All Blacks, with 4 consecutive wins in the Rugby Championship for the first time ever. During the Spring Tour, the Wallabies called up Tolu Latu, Will Skelton and Rory Arnold to help boost their forward pack. A surprise addition was Kurtley Beale, who was called in after an injury to Reece Hodge. Though the Wallabies won against Japan, they lost all their games in Britain, with close losses against Scotland and Wales, and a comprehensive defeat to England. This was the first time in 45 years that the Wallabies lost all games in a European tour. Australia finished the tour by falling to sixth in the world rankings, from a mid-year high of third in the world.

2022 was a hard year for the Wallabies. In the July test series against England, they won the opening game in Perth 30-28, their first victory against the English since 2015, but went on to lose the series losing 17-25 in Brisbane and 17-21 in Sydney. In their opening Rugby Championship match against Argentina, they were down 16-10 at halftime but made an astonishing comeback to win 26-41 in Mendoza, only for them to get thumped by the Pumas 48-17 the next week. They then dominated the Springboks 25-17 in Adelaide, but got stunned the next week in Sydney by the Boks (8-24) Then, in September 2022, the Wallabies dropped to their lowest-ever World Rugby ranking after losing to the All Blacks in Melbourne. The team fell to ninth on World Rugby&#x27;s rankings ladder. They sunk even lower after losing 40-14 to the All Blacks at Eden Park. The Wallabies then managed a close win against Scotland at Murrayfield (15-16), but went on to lose to France (30-29), a stunning loss to Italy (28-27) and to world no. 1 Ireland (13-10). The Wallabies were down 34-13 to Wales after 58 minutes of their last game of the season, but pulled off an amazing comeback to finish a woeful season on a high (34-39)
In 2023, Eddie Jones was back for another stint as coach. It was a slow start as they failed to regain the Bledisloe Cup for yet another year and finished last in the Rugby Championships.
The 2023 Rugby World Cup was a disaster for the Wallabies as they failed to make it past the group stage for the first time. A loss to Fiji was followed by a record loss to Wales. Even though Australia finished level on points with Fiji, Fiji advanced due to winning the match between the two. 

2024 started well for Australia, who beat Wales 25-16 in their first match of the year under new coach Joe Schmidt, who gave 7 debutants their first cap. Liam Wright was named the captain for this match, becoming the most inexperienced Australian captain since Ken Catchpole captained Australia in his debut against Fiji in 1961. In the second match, they won 36-28, and thus retained the James Bevan Trophy. The Wallabies then went on to beat Georgia 40-29, giving the team a 100% record in the 2024 mid-year rugby union tests for 2024. The 2024 Rugby Championship saw the Wallabies finish at last place - they lost to South Africa twice in a row at home, with both results being highly in favour of the visitors, despite improvements from the team in each match. They beat Argentina in a close victory in La Plata, but were destroyed 27-67, this result being the most points Australia had ever conceded in a rugby union match. The next match against the All Blacks was a tight affair - they were down 21-0 after 20 minutes, but the Wallabies had a spirited comeback that saw them fall just short of victory at 28-31 for James Slipper&#x27;s 139th test match, on par with George Gregan. The next match in Wellington saw the Wallabies take a rare lead in New Zealand, leading 13-12 just before the break but the All Blacks scored on halftime to go into the sheds 19-13 - unfortunately, Australia fell apart after the break and lost 13-33. In Schmidt&#x27;s first year in charge of the Wallabies, the Wallabies played 13 tests, winning 6 and losing 7.

In February 2025, it was confirmed that Schmidt would resign as head coach following the conclusion of the 2025 Rugby Championship. His decision was motivated by family reasons although he did suggest he would be willing to stay on in an advisory role. This decision meant Rugby Australia would be looking for their fifth coach in the six years.

== Jersey ==
The Wallabies play in Australia&#x27;s traditional sporting colours of green and gold. Before there was a national jersey in place, the Wallabies would play in the jersey of the state the game was being held. The Australian Coat of Arms would often replace the state logo on the jersey, and a variety of these colours were used in a number of matches in the early 1900s.

During their first years, the colours of the &quot;Wallabies&quot; changed depending on the place where they played. Between 1899 and 1904, the team wore sky blue jersey in Sydney and maroon during their games in Brisbane. During 1905–07, their switched to a maroon and light blue striped shirt, then returning to the sky blue (1908–1928). In 1928 governing bodies agreed that &quot;the Australian amateur representative colours of green and gold, should be adopted&quot;. The following year the All Blacks came to Australia, and the jersey worn was emerald green with the Australian Coat of Arms; with green socks with bars on the top. The jersey remained mainly the same, with a few variations, throughout the 1930s. In the 1961 tour of South Africa, Australia wore the gold and green jersey for the first time, to avoid confusion with the &quot;Springboks&quot; colors.
The away jersey usually is green or white, although in the 1995 Rugby World Cup, the Wallabies wore in the match against Romania a green and gold hooped jersey, with green shorts and socks.

Canterbury&#x27;s design for Australia&#x27;s 2007 World cup jersey was controversial, featuring a curved tan-coloured panel across the chest resembling the shape of a bra. This led the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&#x27;s&quot; chief rugby correspondent to include a satirical piece in his column comparing it to Kramer and Frank Costanza&#x27;s infamous man bra from &quot;Seinfeld&quot;.

In 2010, KooGa became the apparel sponsor. The first KooGa jersey for the Wallabies under KooGa was used from 2010 through to the conclusion of the 2012 season, however, a different set of shorts and socks were made for the 2012 season. A new kit designed by KooGa was revealed in 2013 for the series against the British &amp; Irish Lions. BLK Sport, previously the Australian subdivision of KooGa, became the apparel sponsor after that tour, with the BLK logo replacing the KooGa logo on the kit for the 2013 Spring Tour.

In October 2013, the ARU announced that Asics would be the apparel sponsor beginning in 2014. In the third 2017 Bledisloe Cup test, for the first time, the Wallabies played with an indigenous jersey. Cadbury became the major sponsor of the Wallabies in 2021, replacing Qantas as the front of jersey sponsor.



Notes
==Nickname and mascot==

The nickname &quot;Wallabies&quot; is in reference to the wallaby—a marsupial that is widely distributed throughout Australia. The name has its origins during first United Kingdom and North America tour by the Australian team in 1908. New Zealand had just completed a tour and the English press dubbed their team the &quot;All Blacks&quot;. It was suggested that Australia should too have a nickname, and &quot;Rabbits&quot; was one of the names suggested by the English newspapers. The Australians rejected this, and did not want the national team to be represented by an imported pest. They opted for the native Wallaby instead. At first it was only touring parties that were nicknamed the Wallabies; when Australia played domestically, they were referred to as internationals.

The team mascot is known as Wally. The Wallabies Nunataks are named for the team.

==Record==

When the World Rankings were introduced in 2003, Australia was ranked fourth. Since then, the highest ranking Australia has achieved is second, and the lowest is ninth.

===Rugby World Cup===

Australia has appeared at every Rugby World Cup since the first tournament in 1987. Australia was the first nation to win two World Cups, with victories in 1991 and 1999. They have progressed to four Rugby Union World Cup finals (tied with South Africa), one behind New Zealand&#x27;s record of five. 

In 1987, Australia co-hosted the inaugural Rugby World Cup with New Zealand. They were grouped with England, the United States and Japan in Pool A. In their first ever World Cup match, Australia defeated England 19–6 at Concord Oval in Sydney then went on to beat their other pool opponents to finish the top of their group and advance to the quarter-finals where they defeated Ireland 33–15. They were knocked out by France in the semi-finals, and then lost the third place match against Wales.

Coached by Bob Dwyer for the 1991 World Cup in Europe, Australia again finished at the top of their pool, defeating Western Samoa, Wales and Argentina during the group stages. They met Ireland in the quarter-finals, beating them by one point to go through to the semi-finals, where they defeated the All Blacks 16–6 to qualify for their first World Cup final. Australia beat England 12–6 at Twickenham in the 1991 Rugby World Cup Final to become world champions.

Australia were again automatically qualified for the 1995 World Cup in South Africa and finished second in their pool, losing one game to hosts South Africa. They were then knocked out in the quarter-finals by England. In the 2009 feature film &quot;Invictus&quot; based on the story of the 1995 tournament, Australia can be seen playing South Africa in one of the scenes.

Rod Macqueen was the Australian head coach for the 1999 World Cup in Wales. The team beat Ireland, Romania and the United States during the group stages and, after defeated hosts Wales in the quarter-finals, they turned the tables on defending champions South Africa, beating them 27–21 to make it to the final. There they defeated France 35 to 12, in the 1999 Rugby World Cup Final and becoming the first nation to win the World Cup twice.

Australia were the sole hosts of the tournament in 2003, and went undefeated in Pool A, beating Ireland, Argentina, Romania and Namibia. Australia defeated Scotland in the quarter-finals, and then the All Blacks in what was regarded as an upset in the semi-finals, to go to the final. England won the final in Sydney during extra time with a Jonny Wilkinson drop goal.

The 2007 World Cup in France was not a successful tournament for the Wallabies. While they finished on top of their group in the pool stages, Australia was knocked out by England 12–10 in their quarter-final, again largely due to Jonny Wilkinson&#x27;s goal-kicking prowess. This loss was widely regarded as an upset, given England had only finished 2nd in their pool and were ranked 7th. Nevertheless, England went on to upset hosts France in their semi-final match, and advanced to the final where they were beaten by South Africa.

===Rugby Championship===
Australia&#x27;s main annual tournament is The Rugby Championship (formerly the Tri-Nations from 1996 to 2011), competing with New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina who joined in 2012. Australia has won the tournament four times; in 2000, 2001, 2011 and 2015. Within the Rugby Championship, Australia also competes for the Bledisloe Cup with New Zealand, the Mandela Challenge Plate with South Africa, and the Puma Trophy with Argentina.
===Series played===
===Overall===

Below is a summary of the Test Matches played by Australia up until 1 December 2024:

===Trophies===
Australia contests a number of other trophies against tier one teams from the Northern Hemisphere. The Trophée des Bicentenaires has been contested with France since 1989; the Ella-Mobbs Trophy (formerly the Cook Cup) with England since 1997; the Hopetoun Cup with Scotland since 1998; the Lansdowne Cup with Ireland since 1999; and the James Bevan Trophy with Wales since 2007.
==Players==

===Selection policy===
Up until 2015, to be selected for the Wallabies, eligible players had to play for an Australian Super Rugby franchise, and eligible players playing outside of Australia were not able to be selected.

On 16 April 2015, with the 2015 Rugby World Cup approaching, the ARU announced that it would tweak their selection policy, so that certain players could ply their trade in the Japanese Top League competition from August to February, as long as they continued to play for a Super Rugby franchise from February to August, making them eligible for Wallaby selection as they would also be still playing in Australia.

However, this &quot;flexible contract&quot; would only be given to a select number of players considered by the head coach and the ARU board, which means not all players playing or transferring to Japan would be allowed to play in the Top League and the Super Rugby. As the Top League competition clashes with some Wallaby test matches, Wallaby selectors would use World Rugby&#x27;s regulation 9 (clubs must release players within international windows) to select these players when the Top League clashes with the Rugby Championship in August through to October, and the end-of-year tour in November.

At this point, players playing in Europe were not considered for the flexible contract, as too much of the European season clashes with Wallaby test matches.

However, on 22 April 2015, further changes were made to the original selection policy in order for some European based players to be selected.

In addition to the flexible contract, Australian players playing anywhere in the world can be selected for the Wallabies as long as they fit a certain criteria – A player must have held a professional contract with Australian rugby for at least seven years, and have played 60 tests or more for an overseas based player to be selected.

Further more, if a player does not fit these criteria and plays overseas, but chooses to return to Australia, they become immediately eligible for selection as long as they have signed at least two years with the Australian Super Rugby franchise for the following season. Like the flexible contract, Wallaby selectors would use World Rugby&#x27;s regulation 9 to select overseas based players anywhere in the world.

===Current squad===
On 22 October, Australia named a 34-player squad ahead of the Wallabies 2024 Grand Slam tour. 

Head coach: Joe Schmidt
* Caps Updated: 17 November 2024 












===Notable players===

, the Wallabies have fourteen former players (and two former coaches) in the World Rugby Hall of Fame, which was previously known as the IRB Hall of Fame prior to 2015.

Australians in the World Rugby Hall of Fame (year of induction in brackets):
The two World Cup-winning captains, John Eales and Nick Farr-Jones, were among the first Australians to be inducted. Eales received this honour in 2007.
Farr-Jones and another former Wallaby captain, Nick Shehadie, were inducted in 2011. Shehadie was honoured not as a player but recognised, together with fellow Australian Rugby administrator Roger Vanderfield, as one of four key figures in the creation of the Rugby World Cup. World Cup-winning coaches Bob Dwyer and Rod Macqueen were also inducted in 2011.

Six former Wallaby greats with combined playing careers spanning almost nine decades – Tom Lawton Snr, John Thornett, Ken Catchpole, Mark Ella, David Campese and George Gregan – were added to the list of Australians in the IRB Hall of Fame in 2013.

Lawton, a fly-half whose international career spanned from 1920 to 1932, was noted for his ball-handling and kicking skills, and most notably led Australia to their first-ever clean sweep of the Bledisloe Cup series, in 1929. Thornett, a forward who played in four different positions for the Wallabies, made his international debut in 1955. He earned 35 caps in a 12-year Test career, and captained the Wallabies 15 times. During Australia&#x27;s drawn 1963 Test series against South Africa, in which he served as captain, the Wallabies became the first team in the 20th century to win consecutive Tests over the Springboks.

Gregan, a World Cup-winning scrum-half whose Test career spanned the amateur and professional eras of the sport (1994–2007), is notable as having been the all-time caps leader in international rugby union, with 139 in all (a record since surpassed by Brian O&#x27;Driscoll of Ireland). He also captained the Wallabies in 59 Tests.

A further two World Cup winners, Michael Lynagh and Tim Horan, were inducted in 2014 and 2015 respectively when the separate New Zealand-based International Rugby Hall of Fame was merged with the IRB&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Wallabies and Olympic gold medallists from the 1908 tour of the United Kingdom, Tom Richards and Daniel Carroll, were honoured with inductions in 2015 and 2016. Both of these men went on to become dual internationals in rugby with Richards playing for the 1910 British Lions and Carroll winning further Olympic gold playing for United States in 1920. Both men also received awards for gallantry during their military service in World War I.

Fly-half Stephen Larkham, a World Cup winner in 1999 and renowned for his drop goal to beat South Africa in the semi-final of that tournament, was admitted to the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2018.

===Individual records===

Prop James Slipper is Australia&#x27;s most capped player with 143 Test caps. Former scrum half George Gregan was also the world&#x27;s most capped player until being surpassed by Ireland&#x27;s Brian O&#x27;Driscoll in 2014. Gregan also equalled the record for the most caps as captain with Will Carling, 59 caps (a record later to be broken by John Smit of South Africa). David Campese scored 64 Test tries in his career, which was a world record until Daisuke Ohata of Japan overtook him with 69 tries, and Michael Lynagh was the highest Test points scorer in world rugby with 911 until Neil Jenkins of Wales overtook him with 1037 points. Rocky Elsom scored the fastest forward hat-trick in World Cup history.

The longest winning streak by Australia was produced in the early 1990s, and started at the 1991 World Cup in England, with three pool wins, and subsequent quarter-final and semi-final victories over Ireland and the All Blacks respectively. This was followed by the win over England in the final. The streak continued into the following year, for two matches against Scotland and the All Blacks, lasting in total, 10 games. Similarly, the Australian record for losses in a row is also 10 games, which was sustained from a period from 1899 to 1907, including two British Isles tours, and losses to the All Blacks.

The largest winning margin for Australia was produced at the 2003 World Cup, in which they defeated Namibia 142 points to nil during the pool stages, the match is also the largest number of points scored by Australia. The largest loss was against South Africa, who beat Australia 53–8 in 2008.

===Award winners===
The following Australia players have been recognised at the World Rugby Awards since 2001:




==Coaches==

===Coaching staff===

Prior to 1982, Australia did not select coaches as long-term appointments. Managers were appointed to handle the logistics of overseas tours and the assistant manager often doubled as the coach for the duration of the trip. Sometimes the team captain filled the Australian coaching role, particularly for home tests since the IRB had ruled that home teams could not be assembled until three days before a test match.

==Home grounds==

The Wallabies play at a variety of stadiums around Australia. Some of these include Stadium Australia in Sydney, Lang Park in Brisbane, AAMI Park and Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, and Optus Stadium and nib Stadium in Perth.

A variety of venues were used around Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup matches.

Some of the earlier stadiums that were traditionally used for Wallabies matches, included Sydney&#x27;s Concord Oval and the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) and Sports Ground, as well as Ballymore and the Exhibition Ground in Brisbane. It was the SCG that hosted the first ever Australian international, against Great Britain, in 1899.

==Broadcasters==

Due to Australia&#x27;s anti-siphoning laws every Rugby World Cup (RWC) Australia has participated in has been held, exclusively or in part, on a free-to-air (FTA) broadcasting network.

Before the advent of professionalism, Australia&#x27;s internationals and spring tours were televised by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1957–1991). The first commercial broadcaster to partner with the Wallabies was Network Ten in 1992. The partnership ran until 1995 and saw the broadcaster televise the third edition of the Rugby World Cup (RWC) (1995), held in South Africa for the first time. In 1995 the SANZAR unions (Australian Rugby Union (ARU), New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) and the South African Rugby Union) signed a US$550 million (equivalent to $ million in ), ten-year deal with News Corp, to begin the following year. News Corp on-sold the Australian free-to-air broadcast rights to Seven Network, with the pay-TV rights being given to Foxtel. Included in the deal were the broadcasting rights for the domestic Super 12 competition, the Tri Nations Series as well as the 1999 and 2003 Rugby World Cups. In December 2004, with the then-current deal coming to an end, all three SANZAR unions renewed their broadcasting relationship with News Corp for another five years (2006–2010), valued at AU$423 million (equivalent to $ million in ). The Seven Network also renewed their free-to-air broadcasting partnership months later. In 2010 the SANZAR–News Corp broadcasting deal was once again renewed for another five years (2011–2015), totaling AU$437 million (equivalent to $ million in ). In March 2010 it was reported that Network 10 was believed to be no longer interested in the free-to-air rights. Subsequently, the Nine Network became the official free-to-air broadcast partner of the Wallabies for the first time. In 2013 Network 10 picked up the FTA broadcast rights again, partnering until the end of 2015.

At the end of the 2011–2015 contractual deal, all parties renewed their broadcasting agreement for another four-year deal (2016–2020). The deal was reported to be AU$285 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Although all Wallabies home matches televised were available on Network 10, Spring Tour (November) matches for 2016, 2017 and 2018 were FTA on Special Broadcasting Service (SBS).

In November 2019 it was reported that Australian rugby&#x27;s long-held broadcasting relationship with News Corp (1996–2020) would no longer continue, after Foxtel walked away from negotiations. It was also reported that Optus had expressed interest in a broadcasting deal. Several months later Rugby Australia (RA) were reportedly looking for a new broadcast partner. By the end of the year, Rugby Australia had signed a broadcast deal with Nine Entertainment worth AU$100 million over three years (2021–2023). The agreement spurred Nine Entertainment&#x27;s own over-the-top (OTT) streaming platform known as Stan Sport. The deal had a two-year extension option at the end of its tenure, which Nine extended in early 2023 (2024–2025). In February 2025 it was reported by the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; that Rugby Australia and Nine Entertainment had reached an &quot;in-principle agreement&quot; for a new broadcasting deal worth $210 million over five years.

After attending the Darmstadt Summer Courses, she moved to Germany to study at the Hochschule für Musik Freiburg under Brian Ferneyhough and Klaus Huber. She found her Freiburg teachers&#x27; emphasis on strict serialism and mathematical structures stifling, saying in an interview:

In 1980, Saariaho went to the Darmstadt Summer Courses and attended a concert of the French spectralists Tristan Murail and Gérard Grisey. Hearing spectral music for the first time marked a profound shift in Saariaho&#x27;s artistic direction. These experiences guided her decision to attend courses in computer music that were being given by IRCAM, the computer music research institute in Paris, by David Wessel, , and Marc Battier.

In 1982, she began work at IRCAM researching computer analyses of the sound-spectrum of individual notes produced by different instruments. She developed techniques for computer-assisted composition, experimented with &quot;musique concrète&quot;, and wrote her first pieces combining live performance with electronics. She also composed new works using IRCAM&#x27;s CHANT synthesiser. Each of her Jardin Secret trilogy was created with the use of computer programs. &quot;Jardin secret I&quot; (1985), &quot;Jardin secret II&quot; (1986), and &quot;Nymphea (Jardin secret III)&quot; (1987). Her works with electronics were developed in collaboration with Jean-Baptiste Barrière, a composer, multimedia artist, and computer scientist who directed the IRCAM&#x27;s department of musical research from 1984 to 1987. Saariaho and Barrière married in 1984. They have two children.
In Paris, Saariaho developed an emphasis on slow transformations of dense masses of sound. Her first tape piece, &quot;Vers Le Blanc&quot; from 1982, and her orchestral and tape work, &quot;Verblendungen&quot;, are both constructed from a single transition: in &quot;Vers Le Blanc&quot; the transition is from one pitch cluster to another, while in &quot;Verblendungen&quot;, it is from loud to quiet. &quot;Verblendungen&quot; also uses a pair of visual ideas as its basis: a brush stroke which starts as a dense mark on the page and thins out into individual strands, and the word &quot;Verblendungen&quot; itself, which means &quot;dazzlements, delusions, blindedness&quot;.

Her work in the 1980s and 1990s was marked by an emphasis on timbre and the use of electronics alongside traditional instruments. &quot;Nymphéa (Jardin secret III)&quot; (1987), for example, is for string quartet and live electronics and contains an additional vocal element: the musicians whisper the words of an Arseny Tarkovsky poem, &quot;Now Summer is Gone&quot;. In writing &quot;Nymphea&quot;, Saariaho used a fractal generator to create material. Writing about the compositional process, Saariaho said:

Saariaho often talked about having a kind of synaesthesia, one that involves all of the senses, saying:

Another example is &quot;Six Japanese Gardens&quot; (1994), a percussion piece accompanied by a prerecorded electronic layer of the Japanese nature, traditional instruments, and chanting of Buddhist monks. During her visit to Tokyo in 1993, she expanded her original percussion conception into a semi-indeterminate piece. It consists of six movements that each represent a garden composed of traditional Japanese architecture, by which she was inspired rhythmically. Especially in movement IV and V, she explored many possibilities of complex polyrhythm in liberated instrumentation. She said:

In her book on Saariaho, musicologist writes about the indeterminate nature of this composition:

On 1 December 2016, the Metropolitan Opera gave its first performance of &quot;L&#x27;Amour de loin&quot;, the second opera by a female composer ever to be presented by the company (the first was performed more than a century earlier, in 1903). The subsequent transmission of the opera to cinema on 10 December 2016 as part of the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series marked the first opera by a female composer, and the first opera conducted by a female conductor (Susanna Mälkki), in the series. In 2002 the Santa Fe Opera presented &quot;L&#x27;Amour de loin&quot;. In 2008, the Santa Fe Opera also presented her opera &quot;Adriana Mater&quot;.

Saariaho was the patron of the Helsinki Music Centre organ project and endowed the construction of a new organ in the Helsinki Music Centre with one million euros. She was also the chair of the International Kaija Saariaho Organ Composition Competition, which selected in April 2023 eleven compositions.

Saariaho was diagnosed with glioblastoma in February 2021. She died in Paris on 2 June 2023, at age 70.

Her very last work, &quot;HUSH&quot;, a concerto for trumpet and orchestra, was given its world premiere on 24 August 2023 at the Helsinki Music Centre with Verneri Pohjola and the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Susanna Mälkki. While the premiere was posthumous, Saariaho had been able to hear the work herself at a rehearsal in the spring of 2023. The piece is conceived as a response to Saariaho&#x27;s own first concerto &quot;Graal Théâtre&quot; and based on a text by , Saariaho&#x27;s son and librettist of some of her last works.

<text>Doppelmayr USA, Inc is an aerial lift manufacturer based in Salt Lake City, Utah, and a subsidiary of the worldwide Doppelmayr Garaventa Group. The United States company was formed in 2002 after the merger of Garaventa of Goldau, Switzerland, and Doppelmayr of Wolfurt, Austria. Between 2002 and 2010, the company was named Doppelmayr CTEC. From 2011 the company has operated using the Doppelmayr brand name, in common with most other Doppelmayr Garaventa Group subsidiaries.

==CTEC before merger==

CTEC, which stands for Cable Transportation Engineering Company, was the successor to Thiokol, a company which built 41 ski lifts between 1971 and 1977. By 1977, Thiokol had decided to stop producing ski lifts and sold their designs to two employees, Jan Leonard and Mark Ballantyne.

CTEC&#x27;s first lift produced as an independent manufacturer was at Seven Springs Mountain Resort, Pennsylvania, in 1978. Leonard oversaw engineering at the company&#x27;s Salt Lake City facility while manufacturing was performed in Sacramento, California, where Ballantyne worked. CTEC slowly grew to become one of three major lift manufacturers in North America along with European-owned Doppelmayr USA and Poma of America. In 1989, CTEC partnered with Von Roll to build its first detachable chairlift at Solitude Mountain Resort, Utah.

From 1990 onwards, CTEC used detachable grips built by the Swiss company Garaventa. In 1992, CTEC and Garaventa merged and the new company was named Garaventa CTEC. Prior to the merger, Garaventa had built only a few lifts in North America, including Aerial Trams at Snowbird, Utah, and Palisades Tahoe, California. The combined company utilized the designs and manufacturing facilities of CTEC since Garaventa never had much of a presence in North America besides supplying parts to CTEC. CTEC&#x27;s growing reputation combined with the European ownership and parts supply of Garaventa allowed it to win contracts for large lifts such as the Gold Coast Funitel at Palisades Tahoe, California, gondolas at Telluride Ski Resort and Vail Ski Resort, and Steamboat Springs Ski Resort in Colorado, and Deer Valley, Utah.

==Doppelmayr USA before merger==
Doppelmayr was a world-renowned Austrian ropeway manufacturer that began exporting surface lifts to North America in the 1950s under the name &quot;Alpine Lift.&quot; The first Doppelmayr chairlift in North America was installed at Marmot Basin, Alberta, in 1968. Doppelmayr&#x27;s first North American manufacturing facility in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec, opened in 1978.

Unlike its competitors, Doppelmayr used exclusively European designs in North America. The company built the world&#x27;s first detachable high speed quad chairlift in 1981 at Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado.

In 1996, Doppelmayr&#x27;s European holding company purchased the ropeway department of Von Roll, a Swiss manufacturer which had been making lifts in North America since the mid-1980s. Von Roll owned Hall Ski-Lift, an American company that produced more than 400 lifts from 1960 to 1985. Doppelmayr now controlled all the spare parts sales for Doppelmayr, Von Roll, and Hall brand lifts.

==Merger of Doppelmayr and Garaventa CTEC==
In 2002, Garaventa of Switzerland merged with Doppelmayr of Austria, forming the world&#x27;s largest aerial lift manufacturer. The new company would be known as the Doppelmayr Garaventa Group in Europe and Doppelmayr CTEC in North America.

Starting in 2003, Doppelmayr CTEC produced a new line of products that combined the best designs of Doppelmayr and CTEC. The Uni-GS detachable chairlift terminal design was specifically designed for the North American market and incorporated elements of Garaventa CTEC&#x27;s Stealth line and Doppelmayr&#x27;s Uni line. Many of CTEC&#x27;s fixed-grip designs were kept. Today, manufacturing of fixed-grip chairlift terminals and all tower tubes and chairs is done at Doppelmayr CTEC&#x27;s Salt Lake City factory, while all line equipment and detachable terminals are made in the Quebec plant.

==After the merger==

In 2003, the company installed its first UNI-GS detachable chairlift, the Panorama Quad, at Gunstock Mountain Resort in Gilford, New Hampshire.

In 2003, the company was selected to design, fabricate, install and maintain the Portland Aerial Tram at a cost of $57 million.

In 2005, the company purchased Partek, a small chairlift manufacturer based in Pine Island, New York. Also included in the purchase were Partek&#x27;s rights to Borvig lifts.

Jan Leonard stepped down as president of the company in October 2007 to start a new company, Skytrac Lifts. He was replaced by VP Mark Bee.

In 2007 and 2008, Doppelmayr CTEC constructed two notable lifts at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Whistler Blackcomb, British Columbia. The new tram at Jackson Hole cost $31 million and replaced the iconic original Jackson Hole Tram. Whistler-Blackcomb&#x27;s Peak 2 Peak Gondola is the largest lift of its kind in the world, breaking multiple world records and costing CDN $52 million.

=== Notable failures ===

In February 2021, the new Pucci chairlift which went into service in 2020/2021 season at the Timberline Lodge ski area in Mount Hood, Oregon furnished by Doppelmayr USA broke down due to an electronic failure causing 42 people to become stranded. The Doppelmayr USA chairlift&#x27;s auxiliary motor failed to bring down the passengers stranded and they had to be rescued with ropes.

<doc id="620989" wikidata="Q662389" url="?curid=620989" title="Yugi Mutou">
<text>is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; manga series created by Kazuki Takahashi. Yugi is introduced as a teenager who is solving an Ancient Egyptian artifact known as the Millennium Puzzle, hoping that it will grant him his wish of making friends. After solving the Puzzle, Yugi revives an ancient spirit initially known as ; the spirit is later revealed to be that of the pharaoh . Over the course of the series, Yugi forms friendships with the supporting cast, interacts with Atem, and learns about his past. Besides the original manga, Yugi has also appeared in anime adaptations, films and video games based on the franchise. Throughout his appearances, his signature &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; card is the Dark Magician.

Yugi was created as a weak, young man who is interested in games and becomes a hero when playing them. According to Takahashi, through this trait, Yugi emphasizes the series&#x27; themes; friendship and the enjoyment of games. Atem was created as a hero who would appeal to young children through his strong characterization.

Critical reception to Yugi has been mixed; some writers found Dark Yugi to be too dark for the series, but others praised the development of both him and Yugi. His role in movies, mostly &quot;The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, was also praised for featuring a more mature version of him.

==Creation and development==
Kazuki Takahashi had always been interested in games; he was obsessed with them as a child, an interest which he maintained as an adult. He believed games made players into heroes, and decided to base the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; series around these games with this idea as the premise. He depicted these themes through Yugi, a weak, childish boy who became a hero when he played games. Friendship is another major theme of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;; Takahashi based the names of the two major characters, &quot;Yūgi&quot; and &quot;Jōnouchi&quot;, on the word yūjō (友情), which means &quot;friendship&quot;. , the ability to turn oneself into something or someone else, is something Takahashi believed all children dream of. He considered Yugi&#x27;s &quot;henshin&quot; Dark Yugi, a savvy and invincible player of games, to appeal to children.

Takahashi also believed that modern society focuses too much on winners and losers. He stated that both Yugi and Katsuya Jonouchi (Joey Wheeler in the English anime) had more potential as characters because they focus on enjoying games rather than aiming to win. He also felt that Dark Yugi and Seto Kaiba are weaker characters despite the former&#x27;s heroic traits. As a result, he believes Dark Yugi is at his best when he is being supported by the rest of the cast.

According to Takahashi, Yugi and Kaiba are rivals, and they are not close friends. He believes, however, the most important part of their relationship is before Yugi&#x27;s duel against Marik&#x27;s alter-ego. Before the game begins, Kaiba passes Yugi a card that could help him in the game. This scene felt like one of the most difficult scenes to write because of the pair&#x27;s rivalry.

Yugi was given a hairstyle that would fit the style of shōnen manga, and both Yugis had the same hair, even though Takahashi initially considered giving them different hairstyles to convey different personalities. Takahashi described the hairdo as &quot;an open hand with hints of a dried autumn leaf.&quot; The colorized versions initially used red to show emphasis, though Takahashi later used magenta in place of red to make it easier to shade the hairstyle. The little Yugi form was given a round style of eyes to convey a softer personality, while Dark Yugi had a contrasting facial style to show that he has a different personality. Atem was derived from Tutankhamun.

Megumi Ogata voiced Yugi in the first anime adaption of the manga, with Shunsuke Kazama replacing her for the following one. Dan Green voiced both Yugi and Dark Yugi in U.S. anime episodes. Ogata recalls that the director chose her to voice Yugi and told her, &quot;I can feel the scent of darkness from you&quot; which she believes refers to Yugi&#x27;s anti-heroic alter-ego. This work was raised from scratch when Kazama had no experience as a voice actor and did not know how to do it. Due to the latest movie taking place after the finale, Kazama portrayed him as being more mature. Green has used two voice pitches for Yugi and Dark Yugi&#x27;s voices and enjoyed the parodies his work led to, such as an abridged series.

==Appearances==
===In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;===

Yugi Mutou is the main protagonist of the story. In the manga&#x27;s first chapter, he tries to complete the , one of the seven Millennium Items and an ancient Egyptian artifact, in hopes it will grant his wish of obtaining friends. However, he is bullied by two classmates, Katsuya Jonouchi and Hiroto Honda (Tristan Taylor in the English anime), with the former stealing a piece of the puzzle. When the school&#x27;s hall monitor Ushio beats them up, Yugi comes to the bullies&#x27; defense and is beaten up by Ushio in the process. This causes Jonouchi to return the stolen piece to Yugi&#x27;s grandfather Sugoroku, who later gives Yugi the piece. Yugi is able to complete the Millennium Puzzle, causing him to become possessed by another person. According to the book of the dead, whoever solves the Millennium puzzle inherits the Dark Games and becomes the guardian of right who passes judgement on evil. The second personality inhabiting Yugi&#x27;s body, who is referred to as Dark Yugi and, in the manga, is known by epithets such as the , helps Yugi when he is in trouble. He challenges bullies and criminals to occult judgment games called and enforces to enact justice against evil—the default powers of a Millennium Item wielder.

After Dark Yugi defeats Ushio in a game, Yugi becomes friends with Jonouchi. Across the following chapters, he also forms bonds with other characters, most notably his crush, Anzu Mazaki (Téa Gardner in the English anime), who develops a crush on Yugi&#x27;s alter-ego, and Honda. He also meets Seto Kaiba, who is obsessed with the card game Duel Monsters. He takes the Blue Eyes White-Dragon from Yugi while at school—the card actually belonging to Yugi&#x27;s grandfather, Sugoroku Mutou (Solomon Mutou in the English dub), who got it from a friend— and swaps it for a fake. After Kaiba destroys the card and psychologically tortures Sugoroku, Yugi and his friends enter Kaiba&#x27;s Death-T challenge to stop him. Yugi and Kaiba duel, and after Yugi defeats him it results in a rivalry, as Kaiba seeks to have a rematch against both Yugi and Dark Yugi.

Shortly after Kaiba&#x27;s defeat, Yugi receives an invitation to the Duel Monsters tournaments, held by Maximillion J. Pegasus (Pegasus J. Crawford in Japanese versions). To lure him out, Pegasus steals Sugoroku&#x27;s soul using his Millennium Eye. Yugi and Jonouchi go to the tournament, with the latter seeking to use the prize money to use it for an operation to restore his sister&#x27;s eyesight. Along with Anzu and Honda, Yugi and Jonouchi defeat multiple duelists, but Yugi is forced to let himself be defeated by Kaiba; the soul of Mokuba Kaiba, Kaiba&#x27;s brother, had also been stolen. With the help of a former rival, Mai Kujaku (Mai Valentine in the English anime), Yugi manages to reach Pegasus&#x27; mansion. Following the tournament, Yugi and Dark Yugi defeat Pegasus. While Pegasus restores the stolen souls, Yugi gives Jonouchi the prize money for the medical treatment of his sister, Shizuka Kawai (Serenity Wheeler in the English anime).

Some time after Pegasus&#x27; tournament, Dark Yugi learns from Ishizu Ishtar that he was once a Pharaoh, but his memory was erased during a conflict. Shortly after this, Kaiba announces his own tournament – Battle City – where the losers must give the winner their most valuable card. A group of hunters led by Ishizu&#x27;s corrupted younger brother, Marik, are set to challenge Yugi, having a vendetta against the Pharaoh. In one duel, Yugi is faced by Slifer, the Sky Dragon (Osiris in Japanese versions): one of the three Egyptian God Cards which are recognized as the three strongest cards. Yugi defeats Marik&#x27;s hunter and earns Slifer, which he later uses to defeat Yami Bakura and confront Kaiba in a rematch, who uses the second God Card: Obelisk the Tormentor. Yugi ultimately defeats Kaiba and obtains Obelisk. In the finale, Yugi faces Marik&#x27;s own darker alter-ego, who possesses the third God Card: The Winged Dragon of Ra. Using a card Kaiba had given him, Yugi defeats Marik, obtains Ra, and becomes the tournament&#x27;s champion.

During the final story arc of the manga, Dark Yugi uses the three God Cards to learn of his past, and is transported to an alternate version of his life where he lived as a pharaoh. During this time, the Pharaoh clashes with Yami Bakura while Yugi and his friends search for a way to aid him. At the end of the manga, it is revealed that his name as Pharaoh was , who sealed his soul into the Puzzle along with the Great God of Evil, Zorc Necrophades. The group is able to defeat Zorc and his avatar, Dark Bakura. After this, Yugi engages Atem in a final duel to help him move on to the afterlife.

===In other media===
In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! R&quot;, which takes place following Yugi&#x27;s victory in the Battle City tournament. Yako Tenma, student and adopted son of Maximillion Pegasus, decides to avenge his teacher&#x27;s defeat at the hands of Yugi, believing him to be responsible for Pegasus&#x27; alleged death. Tenma kidnaps Téa Gardner, prompting Yugi and his friend Joey Wheeler to face Tenma&#x27;s RA Project and the duel professors.

He also appears in &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Capsule Monsters&quot;, where he goes with his friends to find the missing Solomon Moto. Along their journey, Yugi realizes they have been transported into the world of Capsule Monsters.

The film &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie: Pyramid of Light&quot; follows a new duel between Yugi and Kaiba with the latter being used by an ancient undead Egyptian lord known as Anubis, who seeks to kill the Pharaoh for revenge.

In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot;, Yugi meets aspiring duelist Jaden Yuki and gifts him the card Winged Kuriboh before wishing him luck. He from offscreen donates a copy of his deck to a museum, but it is stolen and Jaden duels the thief, who uses the cards and imitates Yugi, to get it back. On a field trip, Jaden and his friends try to visit Yugi, but he is not there and his grandfather says he went on a journey. In the finale, Yugi somehow transports Jaden back in time to duel his younger self who still had the Pharaoh.

Yugi also appears in &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!: Bonds Beyond Time,&quot; where he teams up with the duelists Jaden Yuki and Yusei Fudo to defeat the mysterious Paradox to save both Duel Monsters and their timelines.

In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, a film which takes place after the events of the manga, Yugi and his friends are in their final year of high school and deciding on what they will do in the future. They are antagonized by Kaiba, who wishes to face the Pharaoh, who has since moved on to the afterlife. Yugi proves to be an incredibly capable duelist even without the Pharaoh&#x27;s assistance, defeating the antagonist Aigami (Diva in english) in one duel and cornering Kaiba in another. Nevertheless, in the final duel, the Pharaoh briefly appears to assist Yugi in defeating the corrupted Aigami.

The video game &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories&quot; follows the Pharaoh&#x27;s life in Egypt until he is sealed into the Millennium Puzzle. Yugi inherits the puzzle and gathers each Millennium Item, which allows the Pharaoh to deal with his enemies until he keeps peace in his world.

In &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! The Falsebound Kingdom&quot;, Yugi, Joey, Tristan, Téa and Bakura are invited to the testing of the virtual reality game &quot;Kingdom,&quot; which was created by the company SIC. Upon entering the game, they soon find themselves trapped within it, and must summon the help of the game&#x27;s characters and monsters to defeat the game&#x27;s villain, Emperor Heishin, and stop the plans of the game&#x27;s designer, Scott Irvine, to control the three Egyptian God cards. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Links&quot; features Dark Yugi as a playable character.

==Reception==

As the protagonist and franchise mascot of one of the most popular anime of all time, Yugi is considered to be an iconic character in animation, and is often compared to characters like Ash Ketchum as a figurehead in popularizing anime to a wider audience, as well as corresponding merchandise to people outside of Japan. In an &quot;Anime! Anime!&quot; poll, Yugi was rated as the 9th most popular character voiced by Megumi Ogata.

Critical reception to Yugi and Atem has been mixed. In the book &quot;&quot;, Jason Thompson noted that while Yugi and his friends often end up in complicated situations during the series&#x27; first chapters, the portrayal of Dark Yugi might come across as negative due to his actions. During later episodes, however, Thompson viewed Dark Yugi as an admirable &quot;super hero&quot;. In 2013, Thompson again noted Dark Yugi&#x27;s behavior when playing &quot;Penalty Games&quot; on criminal or bullies, and that he was similar to Batman and Superman because he does not kill enemies, but instead gives them gruesome fates. Fred Ladd also noted Yugi&#x27;s weakness is due to his inability to deal with bullies, and that his alter-ego seeks revenge for their actions. Ladd said that Yugi and Dark Yugi developed as characters during the introduction of card games, which are important to the setting, to the series. Thompson agreed, noting that despite Yugi winning most of his duels, Takahashi produces enough drama to make the reader wonder whether he would lose against Pegasus or Marik based on their apparent advantages when playing the game. Briana Lawerence from Mania Entertainment was harsher towards Yugi&#x27;s actions in the series; she found that Yugi was so nearly unbeatable at Duel Monsters that it was almost pointless for new duelists to challenge him.

THEM Anime Reviews criticized Yugi&#x27;s characterization and design in 4Kids&#x27; adaptation of the manga&#x27;s second anime series, with the website citing him as a stereotype. DVD Talk was confused by the way Yugi transforms whenever he plays a game because it left the Millennium Puzzle as a mystery. Dan Green&#x27;s English performance as Yugi has been praised alongside Eric Stuart as Kaiba. While finding Yugi&#x27;s victories in the anime ridiculous, &quot;Fandom Post&quot; still enjoyed his actions; the reviewer also praised Dark Yugi&#x27;s origins and actions as a pharaoh, and the way he engages Bakura. The origins of the Pharaoh and his relationship with the priest Seto, Kaiba&#x27;s previous life, were also praised. For the final duel between Yugi and Dark Yugi, Thompson praised Takahashi&#x27;s writing because through this duel, both the Pharaoh and the reader are given the message to accept death, while Yugi must accept loneliness and become a stronger man.
Critics have also commented upon Yugi&#x27;s role in the movies based on the franchise. DVD Talk found Yugi&#x27;s troubled situation as Duel Monsters&#x27; champion as an annoyance due to its execution, but still felt young children would enjoy it. While enjoying the duel between the protagonists and the villain in &quot;Bonds Beyond Time&#x27;, &quot;UK Anime Network found the three duelists perform moves necessary to introduce their most iconic characters. While reviewing &quot;Dark Side of Dimensions&quot;, IGN praised Yugi&#x27;s growth alongside his friends&#x27; as they interact, making them more mature than in the manga and anime. IGN, however, wrote that although Yugi appears to be the movie&#x27;s main character, he is overshadowed by Kaiba. Anime News Network said the emotional impact of the split between Yugi and the Pharaoh was impactful and that the latter&#x27;s cameo during the finale left a good impression. The Fandom Post criticized the obsessive relationship between Kaiba and the Pharaoh, which came across as romantic. Green&#x27;s performance as the holographic Pharaoh was praised, as was the regular Yugi&#x27;s rivalry with Kaiba.

Takahashi and Mike Mignola, the creator of &quot;Hellboy&quot;, participated in an art exchange in which Takahashi drew Hellboy with Yugi&#x27;s hairstyle, a Millennium Puzzle, and a duel disk, and Mignola drew Hellboy wearing a Millennium Puzzle and a Yugi T-shirt.

<doc id="620991" wikidata="Q2099709" url="?curid=620991" title="Plummer model">
<text>The Plummer model or Plummer sphere is a density law that was first used by H. C. Plummer to fit observations of globular clusters. It is now often used as toy model in N-body simulations of stellar systems.

== Description of the model ==
The Plummer 3-dimensional density profile is given by
formula_1
where formula_2 is the total mass of the cluster, and &quot;a&quot; is the Plummer radius, a scale parameter that sets the size of the cluster core. The corresponding potential is
formula_3
where &quot;G&quot; is Newton&#x27;s gravitational constant. The velocity dispersion is
formula_4

The isotropic distribution function reads
formula_5
if formula_6, and formula_7 otherwise, where formula_8 is the specific energy.

== Properties ==

The mass enclosed within radius formula_9 is given by 
formula_10

Many other properties of the Plummer model are described in Herwig Dejonghe&#x27;s comprehensive article.

Core radius formula_11, where the surface density drops to half its central value, is at formula_12.

Half-mass radius is formula_13

Virial radius is formula_14.

The 2D surface density is:
formula_15
and hence the 2D projected mass profile is:
formula_16

In astronomy, it is convenient to define 2D half-mass radius which is the radius where the 2D projected mass profile is half of the total mass: formula_17.

For the Plummer profile: formula_18.

The escape velocity at any point is
formula_19

For bound orbits, the radial turning points of the orbit is characterized by specific energy formula_20 and specific angular momentum formula_21 are given by the positive roots of the cubic equation
formula_22
where formula_23, so that formula_24. This equation has three real roots for formula_25: two positive and one negative, given that formula_26, where formula_27 is the specific angular momentum for a circular orbit for the same energy. Here formula_28 can be calculated from single real root of the discriminant of the cubic equation, which is itself another cubic equation
formula_29
where underlined parameters are dimensionless in Henon units defined as formula_30, formula_31, and formula_32.

== Applications ==
The Plummer model comes closest to representing the observed density profiles of star clusters, although the rapid falloff of the density at large radii (formula_33) is not a good description of these systems.

The behavior of the density near the center does not match observations of elliptical galaxies, which typically exhibit a diverging central density.

The ease with which the Plummer sphere can be realized as a Monte-Carlo model has made it a favorite choice of N-body experimenters, in spite of the model&#x27;s lack of realism.

<doc id="620992" wikidata="Q7934331" url="?curid=620992" title="Virginia Intermont College">
<text>Virginia Intermont College (VI) was a private college in Bristol, Virginia founded in 1884 to create additional educational opportunities for women. The college became coeducational in 1972. It experienced significant financial difficulties during the last years of its existence, was denied accreditation in 2013, and announced its closure on May 20, 2014.

The name &quot;Intermont&quot; was a reference to the college&#x27;s mountain setting. Holston Mountain, part of the Blue Ridge Mountains, can be seen from the campus in Bristol, Virginia, part of the Tri-Cities region, which also includes Johnson City and Kingsport, Tennessee.

After years of being shuttered and a failed attempt to reopen a business college, the campus suffered a devastating fire in the early morning hours of Friday, December 20, 2024, that resulted in the complete loss of the original core buildings.

==History==

The college was founded as Southwest Virginia Institute in Glade Spring, Virginia, on September 17, 1884, by Reverend J.R. Harrison, a Baptist minister, as a means to bring higher education opportunities to women in southwest Virginia. Instructing both boarding and day students, the school steadily grew until it outgrew its facilities in less than ten years.
The college began moving to a new site in Bristol, Virginia, in 1891, completing its relocation with the beginning of classes on September 14, 1893. Shortly after the move, the name was changed to Virginia Institute, then to Virginia Intermont College in 1908. A reorganization of the curriculum in 1910 brought the college into the junior college movement and the college became the first two-year institution to be accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools.

During the 1960s, five new buildings were constructed to accommodate the school&#x27;s growth. In the early 1970s, Virginia Intermont became a four-year institution granting baccalaureate degrees. 1972 marked another major milestone as VI admitted men and became a coeducational institution.

In July 2010, the college hired its first female president, Dr. E. Clorisa Phillips, who came to VI following 30 years in administration at the University of Virginia. Phillips worked on fundraising initiatives for ongoing renovations and upgrades to the historic campus, and added academic and athletic programs for the 2012–13 academic year. However, her leadership led to catastrophic failure and the ultimate collapse of the institution after 130 years.

===Decline and closure===
In January 2014, faced with declining enrollment, the college announced plans to merge with Webber International University in Babson Park, Florida, but this measure failed in April. On May 4, 2014, faculty president, Dr. Robert Rainwater announced during the 2014 graduation ceremony, that VI would close its doors after 130 years of education in the community.
Just one day after the 2014 graduation, the board of trustees accepted the resignation of President Clorisa Phillips. A statement issued by the college said Phillips stepped down for personal reasons. She served as president for nearly four years. The board of trustees placed the day-to-day leadership of the college with Compass Executives of Nashville with Art Rebrovick serving as interim president and restructuring agent. The college set up teach out programs so it might be possible for students to complete their undergraduate educations with other colleges.

On June 1, 2014, Virginia Intermont released custodianship of student academic records to King University for the purpose of issuing official academic transcripts.

===Sale of campus===
Bluefield College expressed interest in purchasing the property, but backed out when inspections indicated there was $20 million in deferred maintenance to the buildings. In December 2016, the campus was sold for $3.3 million to Chinese businessman George Xu, as a representative for U.S. Magis International Education Center, a New York-based Chinese owned company. Magis intends to open it as a college at a future date. A health-care concern had reportedly agreed to pay a far higher price for the property, but the bank proceeded to auction the property, closing out the prospective buyer. An aggregate of over $5 million in salaries to faculty and staff remain unpaid.

===Destruction===
On December 20, 2024, at approximately 1:00 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, the college campus was devastated by fire. By 6:00 a.m., Main Hall, West Hall, East Hall, and the Administration building had been destroyed in the blaze. Timber joists, floors, and a lack of functioning sprinkler system contributed to the spread. Crews from more than twelve nearby fire departments worked to contain the fire and to prevent embers from igniting nearby Hodges Hall and adjacent houses.

==Accreditation==
Virginia Intermont College was accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) to award the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Social Work. Virginia Intermont&#x27;s accreditation was reaffirmed in early December 2011, but the college was issued a one-year warning for not meeting the agency&#x27;s financial standards. In December 2012, the college&#x27;s accreditation was not renewed and the college was placed on probation for six months. At the end of that review period, the SACS board of trustees recommended the college be removed from SACS membership for failure to &quot;comply with requirements for financial resources and stability.&quot;. The college appealed and won a temporary court injunction to retain its accreditation albeit in a probationary status.

==Campus==
The original campus buildings built between 1891 and 1893 consisted of the main hall (which featured a dining hall, room for 200 boarders, a gymnasium, and indoor pool) as well as a fine arts building and two out buildings which housed classrooms. The original structure, which only consists of the main hall today, was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 4, 1984. The first major addition to the school was in the early 1920s when Hodges Hall and the current president&#x27;s home were constructed. These were followed by the construction of what is currently known as East Hall in 1922. The gymnasium was built in 1930 which was followed shortly by the Library and the Humanities building. No further major construction would take place until the early 1960s when Intermont Hall, Science Hall, the student center, Harrison-Jones Auditorium, and the Worrell Fine Arts Center were constructed.

In summer 2011, VI&#x27;s largest classroom building, Science Hall, was totally renovated adding state-of-the-art labs and equipment, and updating/renovations were made in West and Main bathrooms along with air-conditioning in the recital hall and theater. All of the sidewalks on campus were re-constructed in 2011–12. The college was formulating a Master Plan for further campus renovations and campus upgrades.

==Buildings==
The campus of Virginia Intermont was eight blocks from downtown Bristol. Campus buildings were a blend of modern and historic structures. Major buildings and facilities are described below.
* The Turner Student Center, completed in 1959, is named for Dr. Floyd V. Turner, president of Virginia Intermont from 1956 to 1979.
* The Worrell Fine Arts Center was completed in 1961. The center contains the Dorothy Cigrand Trayer Theatre. The Recital Hall contains a three-manual Moller organ. Theatre and Recital hall were air-conditioned in summer 2011.
* The Science Hall was completed in the spring of 1963 and was completely updated in fall 1999. It was again renovated in summer 2011.
* The J. Henry Kegley Center is an amphitheatre-style lecture hall.
* The Humanities and Social Sciences Building is a three-story classroom and faculty office building.
* Harrison-Jones Memorial Hall, completed in 1967, serves as a chapel-auditorium. It seats 982 people in the air-conditioned space, which also houses the college&#x27;s Flentrop organ. The structure is named for the Rev. J. R. Harrison, founder of the college, and his son-in-law, S. D. Jones, Intermont president from 1889 to 1898.
* The J. Henry Kegley Auditorium is inside Harrison Jones Memorial Hall.
* The Virginia Ruth Hutton Blevins Art Building was donated to the college in 1997 and renovated in 1998.
* The Arnold House, on the corner of Moore and Intermont Drive, is a former family residence that was donated by Bristol businessmen Jack and Joe Arnold.
* Student housing is concentrated in the following buildings: The Main Complex, Hodges Hall, East Hall, Intermont Hall, Prader Hall, and West Hall.
* The Smith-Canter Gymnasium, built in 1928, is named for Mary Lou Smith, an alumna and long-time faculty member of the college, and Virginia Canter, who served as a faculty member and later registrar before her retirement
* The J. F. Hicks Memorial Library houses a traditional print collection and provides access to many electronic resources. The library has over 160,000 items listed in the Appalachian College Association catalog, which is shared with 26 other association members. Approximately 55,000 of these items are print materials contained in the library, while online access is provided to over 97,000 electronic books.
* The Old Manse houses classrooms, faculty offices for the English department, and the Writing Center. The Writing Center was funded in 1995 by the Jessie Ball du Pont Foundation.
* The Riding Center is located six miles (10 km) from the main campus, just off Exit 10 of Interstate 81. It has two indoor rings, one outdoor ring, four wash stalls, and plenty of turnout paddocks. The barn has had numerous updates over the past four years, such as new roofing, new siding, new floors in the stalls, new railing in both indoors.
* The Intermont Photography Lab houses separate laboratories for black and white and color processing and printing as well as a laboratory for experimental processes and specialized techniques.
* The Math Lab is in the Science Hall.
* Van Dyke–Davis Alumni House is on Moore Street. It is named after Mary Van Dyke ‘44 and Mary Coomer Davis ‘47; they helped organize the donation of all the furniture, which is of the period.

Additional facilities include an outdoor amphitheater.

==Organization==
The college was governed by a president, provost, and a board of trustees. Its programs were organized into four divisions: Arts and Sciences, Fine Arts, Pre-Professional Studies (Pre-Law, Pre-Med, and Pre-Vet), and Business Administration. Programs of study leading to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts, Bachelor of Science, and Bachelor of Social Work were offered.

==Athletics==
The Virginia Intermont athletic teams were called the Cobras. The college was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Appalachian Athletic Conference (AAC) from 2001–02 to 2013–14.

Virginia Intermont competed in nine intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, golf and soccer; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, soccer, softball and volleyball; and co-ed sports included cycling. Other sports were men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s cross country, men&#x27;s tennis and men&#x27;s &amp; women&#x27;s track &amp; field.

===Cross country===
The men&#x27;s cross-country program won the NAIA National Championships three years in row, from 2004 to 2006.

===Equestrian===
Virginia Intermont fielded equestrian teams in competitions affiliated with the Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA), the Intercollegiate Dressage Association (IDA), and the International Intercollegiate Equestrian Association (IIEA). VI equestrian teams had a long history of competitive success with more than 15 national championships. The riding program, along with the college&#x27;s top-rated equine studies program, attracted students from across the U.S.

===Discontinuation===
On April 16, 2014, Virginia Intermont announced that it was discontinuing support for athletics. Emory &amp; Henry College acquired the assets of the program in June 2014.

==School traditions==
The college&#x27;s long-held tradition of May Day eventually transitioned to May Court, a time to recognize seniors selected by their classmates for an honor court which occurred each year during graduation festivities.

Another spring tradition was the Torchlight ceremony, which took place after baccalaureate. Graduates marched around the campus and one by one had a torch lit by the president. The group then formed the college below Harrison-Jones Memorial Hall and sang the college song, &quot;Nil Sine Numine.&quot; This song was written by students in 1952 as part of a tradition for students of writing and competing with a song demonstrating pride in the institution. The music for the song was taken from a song called &quot;The Gaudeamus&quot; which was sung in the musical &quot;The Student Prince&quot;. The school songwriting tradition ended when the school became coeducational in 1972.

==Alumni==
* Preston Gannaway (2000), 2008 Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography
* Helen Ruth Henderson, member of the Virginia House of Delegates
* Robert Ssejjemba (2004), professional soccer player

==Faculty==
*Martha Zelt, printmaker, chaired the Department of Art from 1985 to 1989

<text>Eugenio Calabi (May 11, 1923 – September 25, 2023) was an Italian-born American mathematician and the Thomas A. Scott Professor of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in differential geometry, partial differential equations and their applications.

==Early life and education==
Calabi was born in Milan, Italy on May 11, 1923, into a Jewish family. His sister was the journalist Tullia Zevi Calabi. In 1938, the family left Italy because of the racial laws, and in 1939 arrived in the United States.

In the fall of 1939, aged only 16, Calabi enrolled at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, studying chemical engineering. His studies were interrupted when he was drafted in the US military in 1943 and served during World War II. Upon his discharge in 1946, Calabi was able to finish his bachelor&#x27;s degree under the G.I. Bill, and was a Putnam Fellow. He received a master&#x27;s degree in mathematics from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 1947 and his PhD in mathematics from Princeton University in 1950. His doctoral dissertation, titled &quot;Isometric complex analytic imbedding of Kähler manifolds&quot;, was done under the supervision of Salomon Bochner. 

==Academic career==
From 1951 to 1955 he was an assistant professor at Louisiana State University, and he moved to the University of Minnesota in 1955, where he became a full professor in 1960. In 1964, Calabi joined the mathematics faculty at the University of Pennsylvania. Following the retirement of Hans Rademacher, he was appointed to the Thomas A. Scott Professorship of Mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. In 1994, Calabi assumed emeritus status, and in 2014 the university awarded him an honorary doctorate of science.

In 1982, Calabi was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. He won the Leroy P. Steele Prize from the American Mathematical Society in 1991, where his &quot;fundamental work on global differential geometry, especially complex differential geometry&quot; was cited as having &quot;profoundly changed the landscape of the field&quot;. In 2012, he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society. In 2021, he was awarded Commander of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic.

Calabi married Giuliana Segre in 1952, with whom he had a son and a daughter. He died on September 25, 2023, aged 100.

==Research==
Calabi made a number of contributions to the field of differential geometry. Other contributions, not discussed here, include the construction of a holomorphic version of the long line with Maxwell Rosenlicht, a study of the moduli space of space forms, a characterization of when a metric can be found so that a given differential form is harmonic, and various works on affine geometry. In the comments on his collected works in 2021, Calabi cited his article &quot;Improper affine hyperspheres of convex type and a generalization of a theorem by K. Jörgens&quot; as that which he was &quot;most proud of&quot;.

===Kähler geometry===
At the 1954 International Congress of Mathematicians, Calabi announced a theorem on how the Ricci curvature of a Kähler metric could be prescribed. He later found that his proof, via the method of continuity, was flawed, and the result became known as the Calabi conjecture. In 1957, Calabi published a paper in which the conjecture was stated as a proposition, but with an openly incomplete proof. He gave a complete proof that any solution of the problem must be uniquely defined, but was only able to reduce the problem of existence to the problem of establishing &quot;a priori estimates&quot; for certain partial differential equations. In the 1970s, Shing-Tung Yau began working on the Calabi conjecture, initially attempting to disprove it. After several years of work, he found a proof of the conjecture, and was able to establish several striking algebro-geometric consequences of its validity. As a particular case of the conjecture, Kähler metrics with zero Ricci curvature are established on a number of complex manifolds; these are now known as &quot;Calabi–Yau metrics&quot;. They have become significant in string theory research since the 1980s.

In 1982, Calabi introduced a geometric flow, now known as the Calabi flow, as a proposal for finding Kähler metrics of constant scalar curvature. More broadly, Calabi introduced the notion of an extremal Kähler metric, and established (among other results) that they provide strict global minima of the &quot;Calabi functional&quot; and that any constant scalar curvature metric is also a global minimum. Later, Calabi and Xiuxiong Chen made an extensive study of the metric introduced by Toshiki Mabuchi, and showed that the Calabi flow contracts the Mabuchi distance between any two Kähler metrics. Furthermore, they showed that the Mabuchi metric endows the space of Kähler metrics with the structure of a Alexandrov space of nonpositive curvature. The technical difficulty of their work is that geodesics in their infinite-dimensional context may have low differentiability.

A well-known construction of Calabi&#x27;s puts complete Kähler metrics on the total spaces of hermitian vector bundles whose curvature is bounded below. In the case that the base is a complete Kähler–Einstein manifold and the vector bundle has rank one and constant curvature, one obtains a complete Kähler–Einstein metric on the total space. In the case of the cotangent bundle of a complex space form, one obtains a hyperkähler metric. The Eguchi–Hanson space is a special case of Calabi&#x27;s construction.

===Geometric analysis===
Calabi found the &quot;Laplacian comparison theorem&quot; in Riemannian geometry, which relates the Laplace–Beltrami operator, as applied to the Riemannian distance function, to the Ricci curvature. The Riemannian distance function is generally not differentiable everywhere, which poses a difficulty in formulating a global version of the theorem. Calabi made use of a generalized notion of differential inequalities, predating the later viscosity solutions introduced by Michael Crandall and Pierre-Louis Lions. By extending the strong maximum principle of Eberhard Hopf to his notion of viscosity solutions, Calabi was able to use his Laplacian comparison theorem to extend recent results of Joseph Keller and Robert Osserman to Riemannian contexts. Further extensions, based on different uses of the maximum principle, were later found by Shiu-Yuen Cheng and Yau, among others.

In parallel to the classical Bernstein problem for minimal surfaces, Calabi considered the analogous problem for maximal surfaces, settling the question in low dimensions. An unconditional answer was found later by Cheng and Yau, making use of the &quot;Calabi trick&quot; that Calabi had pioneered to circumvent the non-differentiability of the Riemannian distance function. In analogous work, Calabi had earlier considered the convex solutions of the Monge–Ampère equation which are defined on all of Euclidean space and with &#x27;right-hand side&#x27; equal to one. Konrad Jörgens had earlier studied this problem for functions of two variables, proving that any solution is a quadratic polynomial. By interpreting the problem as one of affine geometry, Calabi was able to apply his earlier work on the Laplacian comparison theorem to extend Jörgens&#x27; work to some higher dimensions. The problem was completely resolved later by Aleksei Pogorelov, and the result is commonly known as the &quot;Jörgens–Calabi–Pogorelov theorem&quot;.

Later, Calabi considered the problem of affine hyperspheres, first characterizing such surfaces as those for which the Legendre transform solves a certain Monge–Ampère equation. By adapting his earlier methods in extending Jörgens&#x27; theorem, Calabi was able to classify the complete affine elliptic hyperspheres. Further results were later obtained by Cheng and Yau.

===Differential geometry===
Calabi and Beno Eckmann discovered the Calabi–Eckmann manifold in 1953. It is notable as a simply-connected complex manifold which does not admit any Kähler metrics.

Inspired by recent work of Kunihiko Kodaira, Calabi and Edoardo Vesentini considered the infinitesimal rigidity of compact holomorphic quotients of Cartan domains. Making use of the Bochner technique and Kodaira&#x27;s developments of sheaf cohomology, they proved the rigidity of higher-dimensional cases. Their work was an influence on the later work of George Mostow and Grigori Margulis, who established their global rigidity results out of attempts to understand infinitesimal rigidity results such as Calabi and Vesentini&#x27;s, along with related works by Atle Selberg and André Weil.

Calabi and Lawrence Markus considered the problem of space forms of positive curvature in Lorentzian geometry. Their results, which Joseph A. Wolf considered &quot;very surprising&quot;, assert that the fundamental group must be finite, and that the corresponding group of isometries of de Sitter spacetime (under an orientability condition) will act faithfully by isometries on an equatorial sphere. As such, their space form problem reduces to the problem of Riemannian space forms of positive curvature.

Work of John Nash in the 1950s considered the problem of isometric embeddings. His work showed that such embeddings are very flexible and deformable. In his PhD thesis, Calabi had previously considered the special case of holomorphic isometric embeddings into complex-geometric space forms. A striking result of his shows that such embeddings are completely determined by the intrinsic geometry and the curvature of the space form in question. Moreover, he was able to study the problem of existence via his introduction of the &quot;diastatic function&quot;, which is a locally defined function built from Kähler potentials and which mimics the Riemannian distance function. Calabi proved that a holomorphic isometric embedding must preserve the diastatic function. As a consequence, he was able to obtain a criterion for local existence of holomorphic isometric embeddings.

Later, Calabi studied the two-dimensional minimal surfaces (of high codimension) in round spheres. He proved that the area of topologically spherical minimal surfaces can only take on a discrete set of values, and that the surfaces themselves are classified by rational curves in a certain hermitian symmetric space.

<doc id="621004" wikidata="Q970737" url="?curid=621004" title="Geology of the Grand Canyon area">
<text>The geology of the Grand Canyon area includes one of the most complete and studied sequences of rock on Earth. The nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers exposed in the Grand Canyon and in the Grand Canyon National Park area range in age from about 200 million to nearly 2 billion years old. Most were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient, long-gone sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are represented, including lithified sand dunes from an extinct desert. There are at least 14 known unconformities in the geologic record found in the Grand Canyon.
Uplift of the region started about 75 million years ago during the Laramide orogeny; a mountain-building event that is largely responsible for creating the Rocky Mountains to the east. In total, the Colorado Plateau was uplifted an estimated . The adjacent Basin and Range Province to the west started to form about 18 million years ago as the result of crustal stretching. A drainage system that flowed through what is today the eastern Grand Canyon emptied into the now lower Basin and Range province. The opening of the Gulf of California around 6 million years ago enabled a large river to cut its way northeast from the gulf. The new river captured the older drainage to form the ancestral Colorado River, which in turn started to form the Grand Canyon.

Wetter climates brought upon by ice ages starting 2 million years ago greatly increased excavation of the Grand Canyon, which was nearly as deep as it is now, 1.2 million years ago. Volcanic activity deposited lava over the area 1.8 million to 500,000 years ago. At least 13 lava dams blocked the Colorado River, forming lakes that were up to deep. The end of the last ice age and subsequent human activity has greatly reduced the ability of the Colorado River to excavate the canyon. Dams in particular have upset patterns of sediment transport and deposition. Controlled floods from Glen Canyon Dam upstream have been conducted to see if they have a restorative effect. Earthquakes and mass-wasting erosive events still affect the region.

== Vishnu Basement Rocks ==

At about 2.5 and 1.8 billion years ago in Precambrian time, sand, mud, silt, and ash were laid down in a marine basin adjacent to an orogenic belt. From 1.8 to 1.6 billion years ago at least two island arcs collided with the proto-North American continent. This process of plate tectonics compressed and grafted the marine sediments in the basin onto the mainland and uplifted them out of the sea. Later, these rocks were buried under the surface and pressure-cooked into metamorphic rock. The resulting Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite, which is part of the Vishnu Basement Rocks, consists of the metasedimentary Vishnu Schist and the metavolcanic Brahma and Rama Schists that were formed 1.75 billion to 1.73 billion years ago. This is the resistant rock now exposed at the bottom of the canyon in the Inner Gorge.

As the volcanic islands collided with the mainland around 1.7 billion years ago, blobs of magma rose from the subduction zone and intruded the Granite Gorge Metamorphic Suite. These plutons slowly cooled to form the Zoroaster Granite; part of which would later be metamorphosed into gneiss. This rock unit can be seen as light-colored bands in the darker garnet-studded Vishnu Schist (see 1b in figure 1). The intrusion of the granite occurred in three phases: two during the initial Vishnu metamorphism period, and a third around 1.4 billion years ago. The third phase was accompanied by large-scale faulting, particularly along north–south faults, leading to a partial rifting of the continent. The collision expanded the continent from the Wyoming–Colorado border into Mexico and almost doubled the crust&#x27;s thickness in the Grand Canyon region. Part of this thickening created the high ancestral Mazatzal Mountains.

Subsequent erosion lasting 300 million years stripped much of the exposed sediments and the mountains away. This reduced the very high mountains to small hills a few tens to hundreds of feet (tens of meters) high. Geologist John Wesley Powell called this major gap in the geologic record, which is also seen in other parts of the world, the Great Unconformity. Other sediments may have been added but, if they ever existed, were completely removed by erosion. Such gaps in the geologic record are called unconformities by geologists. The Great Unconformity is one of the best examples of an exposed nonconformity, which is a type of unconformity that has bedded rock units above igneous or metamorphic rocks.

== Grand Canyon Supergroup ==

In late Precambrian time, extension from a large tectonic plate or smaller plates moving away from Laurentia thinned its continental crust, forming large rift basins that would ultimately fail to split the continent. Eventually, this sunken region of Laurentia was flooded with a shallow seaway that extended from at least present-day Lake Superior to Glacier National Park in Montana to the Grand Canyon and the Uinta Mountains. The resulting Grand Canyon Supergroup of sedimentary units is composed of nine varied geologic formations that were laid down from 1.2 billion and 740 million years ago in this sea. Good exposures of the supergroup can be seen in eastern Grand Canyon in the Inner Gorge and from Desert View, Lipan Point and Moran point.
The oldest section of the supergroup is the Unkar Group. It accumulated in a variety of fluvial, deltaic, tidal, nearshore marine, and offshore marine environments. The first formation to be laid down in the Unkar Group was the Bass Formation. Fluvial gravels initially accumulated in shallow river valleys. They later lithified into a basal conglomerate that is known as the Hotauta Member of the Bass Formation. The Bass Formation was deposited in a shallow sea near the coast as a mix of limestone, sandstone, and shale. Diagenesis later altered the bulk of the limestone into dolomite. It is thick and grayish in color. Averaging 1250 million years old, this is the oldest layer exposed in the Grand Canyon that contains fossils—stromatolites. Hakatai Shale is made of thin beds of marginal-marine-derived mudstones, sandstones, and shale that, together, are thick. This formation indicates a short-lived regression (retreat) of the seashore in the area that left mud flats. Today it is very bright orange-red and gives the Red Canyon its name. Shinumo Quartzite is a resistant marine sedimentary quartzite that was eroded to form monadnocks that later became islands in Cambrian time. Those islands withstood wave action long enough to become re-buried by other sediments in the Cambrian Period. Dox Formation is over thick and is made of sandstone with some interbedded shale beds and mudstone that were deposited in fluvial and tidal environments. Ripple marks and other features indicate it was close to the shore. Outcrops of this red to orange formation can be seen in the eastern parts of the canyon. Fossils of stromatolites and algae are found in this layer. At 1070 ± 70 million years old, the Cardenas Basalt is the youngest formation in the Unkar Group. It is made of layers of dark brown basaltic rocks that flowed as lava up to thick.

Nankoweap Formation is around 1050 million years old and is not part of a group. This rock unit is made of coarse-grained sandstone, and was deposited in a shallow sea on top of the eroded surface of the Cardenas Basalt. The Nankoweap is only exposed in the eastern part of the canyon. A gap in the geologic record, an unconformity, follows the Nankoweap.

All formations in the Chuar Group were deposited in coastal and shallow sea environments about 1000 to 700 million years ago. The Galeros Formation is a mainly greenish formation composed of interbedded sandstone, limestone, and shale. Fossilized stromatolites are found in the Galeros. The Kwagunt Formation consists of black shale and red to purple mudstone with some limestone. Isolated pockets of reddish sandstone are also found around Carbon Butte. Stromatolites are found in this layer.

About 800 million years ago the supergroup was tilted 15° and block faulted in the Grand Canyon Orogeny. Some of the block units moved down and others moved up while fault movement created north–south-trending fault-block mountain ranges. About 100 million years of erosion took place that washed most of the Chuar Group away along with part of the Unkar Group (exposing the Shinumo Quartzite as previously explained). The mountain ranges were reduced to hills, and in some places, the whole of the supergroup were removed entirely, exposing the basement rocks below. Any rocks that were deposited on top of the Grand Canyon Supergroup in the Precambrian were completely removed. This created a major unconformity that represents 460 million years of lost geologic history in the area.

== Tonto Group ==

During the Paleozoic era, the western part of what would become North America was near the equator and on a passive margin. The Cambrian Explosion of life took place over about 15 million years in this part of the world. Climate was warm and invertebrates, such as the trilobites, were abundant. An ocean started to return to the Grand Canyon area from the west about 550 million years ago. As its shoreline moved east, river profiles rose and fluvial sediments accumulated within tectonic basins and coastal plains at first as the Sixtymile Formation, a tan-colored sandstone with some small layers of shale. Later rising sea level resulted in the local accumulation of sediments in paleovalleys as the base of the Tapeat Sandstone. As sea level rose, the ocean flooded the coastal plain causing the concurrent deposition of the Tapeats Sandstone, Bright Angel Shale, Muav Limestone, and Frenchman Mountain Dolostone. Finally, the Frenchman Mountain Dolostone accumulated in beneath shallow seas.
Tapeats Sandstone averages 525 million years old and is made of medium- to coarse-grained sand and conglomerate that was deposited on an ancient shore (see 3a in figure 1). Ripple marks are common in the upper members of this dark brown thin-bedded layer. Fossils and imprint trails of trilobites and brachiopods have also been found in the Tapeats. Today it is a cliff-former that is thick. Bright Angel Shale averages 515 million years old and is made of mudstone-derived shale that is interbedded with small sections of sandstone and shaly limestone with a few thin beds of dolomite. It was mostly deposited as mud just offshore and contains brachiopod, trilobite, and worm fossils (see 3b in figure 1). The color of this formation is mostly various shades of green with some brownish-tan to gray parts. It is a slope-former and is thick. Glauconite is responsible for the green coloration of the Bright Angel. Muav Limestone averages 505 million years old and is made of gray, thin-bedded limestone that was deposited farther offshore from calcium carbonate precipitates (see 3c in figure 1). The western part of the canyon has a much thicker sequence of Muav than the eastern part. The Muav is a cliff-former, thick.

These three formations were laid down over a period of 30 million years from early-to-middle Cambrian time. Trilobites followed by brachiopods are the most commonly reported fossils in this group but well-preserved fossils are relatively rare. We know that the shoreline was transgressing (advancing onto land) because finer grade material was deposited on top of coarser-grained sediment. Today, the Tonto Group makes up the Tonto Platform seen above and following the Colorado River; the Tapeats Sandstone and Muav Limestone form the platform&#x27;s cliffs and the Bright Angel Shale forms its slopes. Unlike the Proterozoic units below it, the Tonto Group&#x27;s beds basically lie in their original horizontal position. The Bright Angel Shale in the group forms an aquiclude (barrier to groundwater seeping down), and thus collects and directs water through the overlying Muav Limestone to feed springs in the Inner Gorge.

== Temple Butte, Redwall, and Surprise Canyon ==
The next two periods of geologic history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are missing from the Grand Canyon sequence. Geologists do not know if sediments were deposited in these periods and were later removed by erosion or if they were never deposited in the first place. Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65 million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.
Geologists do know that deep channels were carved on the top of the Muav Limestone during this time. Streams were the likely cause, but marine scour may be to blame. Either way, these depressions were filled with freshwater limestone about 385 million years ago in the Middle Devonian in a formation that geologists call the Temple Butte Formation (see 4a in figure 1). Marble Canyon in the eastern part of the park displays these filled purplish-colored channels well. Temple Butte Formation is a cliff-former in the western part of the park where it is gray to cream-colored dolomite. Fossils of animals with backbones are found in this formation; bony plates from freshwater fish in the eastern part and numerous marine fish fossils in the western part. Temple Butte Formation is thick; thinner near Grand Canyon Village and thicker in western Grand Canyon. An unconformity representing 40 to 50 million years of lost geologic history marks the top of this formation.

The next formation in the Grand Canyon geologic column is the cliff-forming Redwall Limestone, which is thick (see 4b in figure 1). Redwall is composed of thick-bedded, dark brown to bluish gray limestone and dolomite with white chert nodules mixed in. It was laid down in a retreating shallow tropical sea near the equator during 40 million years of the early-to-middle Mississippian. Many fossilized crinoids, brachiopods, bryozoans, horn corals, nautiloids, and sponges, along with other marine organisms such as large and complex trilobites have been found in the Redwall. In late Mississippian time, the Grand Canyon region was slowly uplifted and the Redwall was partly eroded away. A Karst topography consisting of caves, sinkholes, and subterranean river channels resulted but were later filled with more limestone. The exposed surface of Redwall gets its characteristic color from rainwater dripping from the iron-rich redbeds of the Supai and Hermit shale that lie above.

Surprise Canyon Formation is a sedimentary layer of purplish-red shale that was laid down in discontinuous beds of sand and lime above the Redwall (see 4c in figure 1). It was created in very late Mississippian and possibly in very earliest Pennsylvanian time as the land subsided and tidal estuaries filled river valleys with sediment. This formation only exists in isolated lenses that are thick. Surprise Canyon was unknown to science until 1973 and can be reached only by helicopter. Fossil logs, other plant material and marine shells are found in this formation. An unconformity marks the top of the Surprise Canyon Formation and in most places this unconformity has entirely removed the Surprise Canyon and exposed the underlying Redwall.

== Supai Group ==

An unconformity of 15 to 20 million years separates the Supai Group from the previously deposited Redwall Formation. Supai Group was deposited in late Mississippian, through the Pennsylvanian and into the Early Permian time, some 320 million to 270 million years ago. Both marine and non-marine deposits of mud, silt, sand and calcareous sediments were laid down on a broad coastal plain similar to the Texas Gulf Coast of today. Around this time, the Ancestral Rocky Mountains rose in Colorado and New Mexico and streams brought eroded sediment from them to the Grand Canyon area.

Supai Group formations in the western part of the canyon contain limestone, indicative of a warm, shallow sea, while the eastern part was probably a muddy river delta. This formation consists of red siltstones and shale capped by tan-colored sandstone beds that together reach a thickness of 600 to 700 ft (around 200 m). Shale in the early Permian formations in this group were oxidized to a bright red color. Fossils of amphibian footprints, reptiles, and plentiful plant material are found in the eastern part and increasing numbers of marine fossils are found in the western part.

Formations of the Supai Group are from oldest to youngest (an unconformity is present at the top of each): Watahomigi (see 5a in figure 1) is a slope-forming gray limestone with some red chert bands, sandstone, and purple siltstone that is thick. Manakacha (see 5b in figure 1) is a cliff- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and red shale that averages thick in Grand Canyon. Wescogame (see 5c in figure 1) is a ledge- and slope-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick. Esplanade (see 5d in figure 1) is a ledge- and cliff-forming pale red sandstone and siltstone that is thick. An unconformity marks the top of the Supai Group.

== Hermit, Coconino, Toroweap, and Kaibab ==
Like the Supai Group below it, the Permian-aged Hermit Formation was probably deposited on a broad coastal plain (see 6a in figure 1). The alternating thin-bedded iron oxide, mud and silt were deposited via freshwater streams in a semiarid environment around 280 million years ago. Fossils of winged insects, cone-bearing plants, and ferns are found in this formation as well as tracks of vertebrate animals. It is a soft, deep red shale and mudstone slope-former that is approximately thick. Slope development will periodically undermine the formations above and car- to house-sized blocks of that rock will cascade down onto the Tonto Platform. An unconformity marks the top of this formation .
Coconino Sandstone formed about 275 million years ago as the area dried out and sand dunes made of quartz sand invaded a growing desert (see 6b in figure 1). Some Coconino fills deep mudcracks in the underlying Hermit Shale and the desert that created the Coconino lasted for 5 to 10 million years. Today, the Coconino is a thick golden white to cream-colored cliff-former near the canyon&#x27;s rim. Cross bedding patterns of the frosted, fine-grained, well-sorted and rounded quartz grains seen in its cliffs is compatible with but does not substantiate conclusively an eolian environment. Also fossilized are tracks from lizard-like creatures and what look like tracks from millipedes and scorpions. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.
Next in the geologic column is the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists of red and yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone interbedded with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The average age of the rock is about 273 million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.

One of the highest, and therefore youngest, formations seen in the Grand Canyon area is the Kaibab Limestone (see 6d in figure 1). It erodes into ledgy cliffs that are thick and was laid down in latest early Permian time, about 270 million years ago, by an advancing warm, shallow sea. The formation is typically made of sandy limestone sitting on top of a layer of sandstone. This is the cream to grayish-white rock that park visitors stand on while viewing the canyon from both rims. It is also the surface rock covering much of the Kaibab Plateau just north of the canyon and the Coconino Plateau immediately south. Shark teeth have been found in this formation as well as abundant fossils of marine invertebrates such as brachiopods, corals, mollusks, sea lilies, and worms. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.
== Mesozoic deposition ==

Uplift marked the start of the Mesozoic and streams started to incise the newly dry land. Streams flowing through broad low valleys in Triassic time deposited sediment eroded from nearby uplands, creating the once -thick Moenkopi Formation. The formation is made from sandstone and shale with gypsum layers in between. Moenkopi outcrops are found along the Colorado River in Marble Canyon, on Cedar Mountain (a mesa near the southeastern park border), and in Red Butte (located south of Grand Canyon Village). Remnants of the Shinarump Conglomerate, itself a member of the Chinle Formation, are above the Moenkopi Formation near the top of Red Butte but below a much younger lava flow.

Formations totaling over in thickness were deposited in the region in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic but were almost entirely removed from the Grand Canyon sequence by subsequent erosion. The geology of the Zion and Kolob canyons area and the geology of the Bryce Canyon area records some of these formations. All these rock units together form a super sequence of rock known as the Grand Staircase.

== Cenozoic regional uplift and erosion of the canyon ==
=== Uplift and nearby extension ===

The Laramide orogeny affected all of western North America by helping to build the American cordillera. The Kaibab Uplift, Monument Upwarp, the Uinta Mountains, San Rafael Swell, and the Rocky Mountains were uplifted, at least in part, by the Laramide orogeny. This major mountain-building event started near the end of the Mesozoic, around 75 million years ago, and continued into the Eocene period of the Cenozoic. It was caused by subduction off the western coast of North America. Major faults that trend north–south and cross the canyon area were reactivated by this uplift. Many of these faults are Precambrian in age and are still active today. Streams draining the Rocky Mountains in early Miocene time terminated in landlocked basins in Utah, Arizona and Nevada but there is no evidence for a major river.

Around 18 million years ago, tensional forces started to thin and drop the region to the west, creating the Basin and Range Province. Basins (grabens) dropped down and mountain ranges (horsts) rose up between old and new north–south–trending faults. However, for reasons poorly understood, the beds of the Colorado Plateaus remained mostly horizontal through both events even as they were uplifted about in two pulses. The extreme western part of the canyon ends at one of the Basin and Range faults, the Grand Wash, which also marks the boundary between the two provinces.

Uplift from the Laramide orogeny and the creation of the Basin and Range province worked together to steepen the gradient of streams flowing west on the Colorado Plateau. These streams cut deep, eastward-growing, channels into the western edge of the Colorado Plateau and deposited their sediment in the widening Basin and Range region.

According to a 2012 study, there is evidence that the western Grand Canyon could be as old as 70 million years.

=== Colorado River: origin and development ===
Rifting started to create the Gulf of California far to the south 6 to 10 million years ago. Around the same time, the western edge of the Colorado Plateau may have sagged slightly. Both events changed the direction of many streams toward the sagging region and the increased gradient caused them to downcut much faster. From 5.5 million to 5 million years ago, headward erosion to the north and east consolidated these streams into one major river and associated tributary channels. This river, the ancestral Lower Colorado River, started to fill the northern arm of the gulf, which extended nearly to the site of Hoover Dam, with estuary deposits.
At the same time, streams flowed from highlands in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The mechanism by which the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from much of the rest of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger drainage area and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.

Ice ages during the Pleistocene brought a cooler and wetter pluvial climate to the region starting 2 to 3 million years ago. The added precipitation increased runoff and the erosive ability of streams (especially from spring melt water and flash floods in summer). With a greatly increased flow volume the Colorado cut faster than ever before and started to quickly excavate the Grand Canyon 2 million years before present, almost reaching the modern depth by 1.2 million years ago.

The resulting Grand Canyon of the Colorado River trends roughly east to west for between Lake Powell and Lake Mead. In that distance, the Colorado River drops and has excavated an estimated of sediment to form the canyon. This part of the river bisects the -high Kaibab Uplift and passes seven plateaus (the Kaibab, Kanab, and Shivwits plateaus bound the northern part of the canyon and the Coconino bounds the southern part). Each of these plateaus are bounded by north–south-trending faults and monoclines created or reactivated during the Laramide orogeny. Streams flowing into the Colorado River have since exploited these faults to excavate their own tributary canyons, such as Bright Angel Canyon.

=== Volcanic activity in the western canyon ===

Volcanic activity started in Uinkaret volcanic field (in the western Grand Canyon) about 3 million years ago. Over 150 flows of basaltic lava dammed the Colorado River at least 13 times from 725,000 to 100,000 years ago. The dams typically formed in weeks, were long, high (thicker upstream and thinner downstream) and had volumes of .

The longevity of the dams and their ability to hold Colorado River water in large lakes has been debated. In one hypothesis water from the Colorado River backed up behind the dams in large lakes that extended as far as Moab, Utah. Dams were overtopped in short time; those that were high were overtopped by their lakes in 2 to 17 days. At the same time, sediment filled the lakes behind the dams. Sediment would fill a lake behind a -high dam in 10.33 months, filled a lake behind an -high dam in 345 years, and filled the lake behind the tallest dam in 3000 years. Cascades of water flowed over a dam while waterfalls migrated up-river along it. Most lava dams lasted for around 10,000 to 20,000 years. However others have proposed that the lava dams were much more ephemeral and failed catastrophically before overtopping. In this model dams would fail due to fluid flow through fractures in the dams and around dam abutments, through permeable river deposits and alluvium.

Since the demise of these dams the Colorado River has carved a maximum of about into the rocks of the Colorado Plateau 

== Ongoing geology and human impact ==

The end of the Pleistocene ice ages and the start of the Holocene began to change the area&#x27;s climate from a cool, wet pluvial one to dryer semi-arid conditions similar to that of today. With less water to cut, the erosive ability of the Colorado was greatly reduced. Mass wasting processes thus began to become relatively more important than they were before. Steeper cliffs and further widening the Grand Canyon and its tributary canyon system occurred. An average of two debris flows per year reach the Colorado River from tributary canyons to form or expand rapids. This type of mass wasting is the main way the smaller and steeper side canyons transport sediment but it also plays a major role in excavating the larger canyons.
In 1963 Glen Canyon Dam and other dams farther upstream started to regulate the flow of the Colorado River through Grand Canyon. Pre-dam but still historic flows of the Colorado through Grand Canyon ranged from per second with at least one late 19th century flood of per second. Discharge from Glen Canyon Dam exceeds per second only when there is danger of overtopping the dam or when the level of Lake Powell otherwise needs to be lowered. An interim conservation measure since 1991 has held maximum flows at per second even though the dam&#x27;s power plant can handle per second more flow.

Controlling river flow by use of dams has diminished the river&#x27;s ability to scour rocks by substantially reducing the amount of sediment it carries. Dams on the Colorado River have also changed the character of the river water. Once both muddy and warm, the river is now clear and averages a temperature year-round. Experimental floods approaching the per second level mentioned above have been carried out in 1996 and 2004 to study the effects on sediment erosion and deposition.

Grand Canyon lies on the southern end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north–south-trending faults that cross the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.
== Trail of Time and Yavapai Geology Museum ==

The Trail of Time is an outdoor geology exhibit and nature trail on the South Rim of Grand Canyon National Park. Each meter walked on the trail represents one million years of Grand Canyon&#x27;s geologic history. Bronze markers on the trail mark your location in time. The trail begins at &quot;Today&quot; near the Yavapai Geology Museum, and ends 2 billion years later at Verkamp&#x27;s Visitor Center. Along the way are samples of the Canyon&#x27;s rocks, as you would encounter them going from the rim down to the river, and displays explaining the geologic history of the Canyon. The trail opened in late 2010.

The Yavapai Geology Museum include three-dimensional models, photographs, and exhibits which allow park visitors to see and understand the complicated geologic story of the area. The museum building, the historic Yavapai Observation Station (built 1928), located one mile (1.6 km) east of Market Plaza, features expansive canyon views. A bookstore offers a variety of materials about the area.

<doc id="621008" wikidata="Q1208873" url="?curid=621008" title="Air cooling">
<text>Air cooling is a method of dissipating heat. It works by expanding the surface area or increasing the flow of air over the object to be cooled, or both. An example of the former is to add cooling fins to the surface of the object, either by making them integral or by attaching them tightly to the object&#x27;s surface (to ensure efficient heat transfer). In the case of the latter, it is done by using a fan blowing air into or onto the object one wants to cool. The addition of fins to a heat sink increases its total surface area, resulting in greater cooling effectiveness. There are two types of cooling pads that can be used for air cooling: one is the honeycomb design and another one is excelsior.

In all cases, the air has to be cooler than the object or surface from which it is expected to remove heat. This is due to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that heat will only move spontaneously from a hot reservoir (the heat sink) to a cold reservoir (the air).

== Derating at high altitude ==
When operating in an environment with lower air pressure like high altitude or airplane cabins, the cooling capacity has to be derated compared to that of sea level.

A rule-of-thumb formula to note: 1 – (h/17500) = derating factor. Where &quot;h&quot; is the height over sea level in meters. And the result is the factor that should be multiplied with the cooling capacity in [W] to get the cooling capacity at the specified height over sea level.

<text>Wanhua District (), known in Taiwanese Hokkien as Báng-kah khu () and historically as &quot;Monga&quot; or &quot;Monka&quot;, is a district in Taipei, Taiwan. It is Taipei&#x27;s oldest district. The district is home to historic buildings such as the Bangka Lungshan Temple and the Red House Theater.

Wanhua was the first district in Taipei to undergo economic development; many of the buildings and cultural sites in the region are older than those in surrounding districts. A large number of temples in Wanhua are attributed with originating from the Qing era.

Wanhua District is divided up into 36 villages () and 722 neighborhoods (). In recent years, the population in the district has been in decline. It also has a higher concentration of mainlanders. Nevertheless, this district continues to be treasured by many as it is representative of some of Taipei&#x27;s richest historical cultures – for example, the annual temple rituals held at Qingshan Temple, also known as the Qing Shan King Sacrificial Ceremony. This is a grand religious fiesta and celebration that involves a procession within Wanhua District for three consecutive nights.

==Etymology==
&quot;Wanhua&quot; is the Mandarin Chinese pronunciation of , a name coined by the Japanese because of its phonetic resemblance to the area&#x27;s former name in Taiwanese Hokkien (). Spellings used in English works circa 1900 include &quot;Banka&quot;, &quot;Manka&quot; and &quot;Bang-kah&quot;. The old Taiwanese Hokkien name possibly derives from bangka (&quot;&quot;), the Austronesian word from one of the northern Formosan languages for a kind of &quot;outrigger canoe&quot;. This is also attributed to the location of Wanhua, which is beside the Tamsui River and was once a prosperous trading port.

==History==

===Qing Dynasty===
In the late Qing era, Hobe (modern-day Tamsui District) was the treaty port of northern Taiwan, whereas the trade was conducted at Bangka. Therefore, in 1862, the British Consulate succeeded in extending the limits of the port up the Tamsui River to include Banka, which was more than from the port. Bangka was the largest and most important city of northern Formosa, thoroughly Chinese, and, in the initial experience of missionary George Leslie Mackay, intensely anti-foreign.

===Empire of Japan===
In the early 20th century, with a population of about 27,000, &quot;Banka&quot; was Taiwan&#x27;s third most populous city, following the nearby suburb of &quot;Daitōtei&quot;. Both cities were part of the &quot;Taihoku&quot; (Taipei) capital area but outside of the city proper, which was occupied mainly by the Japanese official class.

===Republic of China===
After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, the area where Wanhua District covers now used to consist of Longshang District () and Shuangyuan District (). In 1990, the two districts merged and formed Wanhua District.

==Tourism and shopping==
Wanhua District can be divided into three sections: northern, central, and southern. The northern area, including Ximending, is popular for its large number of shopping centers - which makes it popular among the younger generation. Many historical sites are located in Central Wanhua, including Lungshan Temple, Qingshui Temple, Qingshan Temple and Bopiliao Historic Block. Southern Wanhua is mainly a residential area with a wide city park, also known as the Youth Park.

Night markets, a staple of Taiwanese culture, are widespread in the district and include the Huaxi Street Night Market, Xichang Street Night Market, Guangzhou Street Night Market, Wuzhou Street Night Market, and Nanjichang Night Market.

Huaxi Street Night Market is a two-block long night market located near Lungshan Temple. The market contains stands that serve local snacks, and restaurants that serve traditional Taiwanese dishes and uncommon delicacies such as: snake blood and meat, turtle blood and meat and deer penis wine. The area is also the site of Taipei&#x27;s former red-light district. Prostitution was outlawed in the 1990s although prostitutes can still be readily found.

Huannan Market is also located in the district. The market is the biggest traditional market in Taipei. There, vendors sell produce, meats, seafood and cooked foods.

Other tourist attractions include the Heritage and Culture Education Center of Taipei City, Qingyunge Art, Wanhua Lin&#x27;s Mansion and Ximending Mazu Temple.

<doc id="621010" wikidata="Q1129398" url="?curid=621010" title="Fan convention">
<text>A fan convention (also known as a con or fan meeting) is an event in which fans of a particular topic gather to participate and hold programs and other events, and to meet experts, famous personalities, and each other. Some also incorporate commercial activity. The term dates back to at least 1942.

==Overview==
Fan conventions are traditionally organized by fans on a not-for-profit basis, though some events catering &quot;to&quot; fans are run by commercial interests for profit. Many conventions have award presentations relating to their genre (such as the Hugo Awards which have been presented at The World Science Fiction Convention (WorldCon) since 1953). 

At commercial events, performers often give out autographs to the fans, sometimes in exchange for a flat appearance fee, and sometimes may perform songs that have no relevance to the shows or otherwise entertain the fans. Commercial conventions are usually quite expensive and are hosted in hotels. There is often tight security for the celebrities to protect against potentially fanatic fans. Such features are not common at traditional science-fiction conventions, which are more oriented toward science fiction as a mode of literature, rather than toward visual media, and do not include any paid appearances by famous personalities, and maintain a less caste-like differentiation between professional and fan. 

Anime conventions, gaming conventions, filk-music conventions, and furry conventions may all be considered derivatives of science-fiction conventions, which began in the late 1930s. 

 While the wearing of costumes—and even a costume competition (known as a &quot;masquerade&quot;)—has been an occasional feature of traditional science-fiction conventions since Morojo and Forrest J Ackerman wore them during the First World Science Fiction Convention in 1939, this has never been the dominant feature of such events. From press coverage of comic book and anime conventions has arisen the widespread image of fans&#x27; tendency to dress up as their favorite characters in elaborate costumes (known as &quot;cosplay&quot; in anime terminology) that are time-consuming and/or expensive to assemble.

Different conventions use different methods to count their attendance, which leads to some confusion about actual convention size.

== History ==
Fan conventions for various genres of entertainment extend to the first conventions held in the 1930s. However, while a few conventions were created in various parts of the world within the period between 1935–1960, the number of convention establishments increased slightly in the 1960s and then increased dramatically in the 1970s, with many of the largest conventions in the modern era being established during the latter decade. Impetuses for further establishment of local fan conventions include:

* The return of superhero characters and franchises during the Silver Age of Comic Books (1956–1970).
* Science fiction adaptations for television serials (e.g., &quot;Star Trek&quot;) in the 1960s–1970s.
* The growth of role-playing (in the 1970s and 1980s) as a genre of tabletop, live-action and eventually video/computer gaming, which not only inspired roleplay of favorite characters in full-body costumes but also inspired existing franchises to adapt their themes for said methods of gaming.
* The growth in home taping (starting with VHS in the late 1970s) of television broadcasts, including popular serials.
* The growth of computerized communication, including the Internet and Internet-dependent applications in the 1980s and 1990s.

<doc id="621016" wikidata="Q750385" url="?curid=621016" title="Sidelifter">
<text>A sidelifter is a specialised vehicle or semi-trailer used to hoist and transport ISO standard intermodal containers over longer distances.

==Overview==

The sidelifter loads and unloads containers via a pair of hydraulic powered cranes mounted at each end of the vehicle chassis. The cranes are designed to lift containers from the ground, from other vehicles including rolling stock, from railway wagons and directly from stacks on docks or aboard container ships. A standard sidelifter is also able to stack a container at a two containers&#x27; height on the ground. If the sidelifter chassis is of 40&#x27; length or more, the cranes of the sidelifter can be shifted hydraulically along the sidelifter chassis to be able to pick up either one 20&#x27;, one 40&#x27;, or two 20&#x27; ISO containers at a time.

As the Sidelifter is suitable for travelling on general roads for large distances and able to quickly load and unload without additional equipment, it is often used for delivering and picking up shipping containers from within a commercial district. Although these can self load, they are more often loaded, or unloaded at the port with a straddle carrier or reach stacker.

==Alternative names==
This equipment has been referred to with a myriad of alternate names. Some of these are:
* Self Loading Truck or Self Loading Trailer, (SLT)
* Sideloader or Sidlastare
* Containerlift or Containerlifter
* Simalift or Hammarlift
* Boxmover or Boxloader
* SelfLifter
* Container picker or Sidepicker
* Swinglift or Swing lifter
* VALARTLIFT

==History==

The sidelifter was invented during the 1960s by Kaspar Klaus who was granted a number of patents for the equipment manufactured by Klaus Transport-systeme GmbH of Germany, with a focus on military operations. The Klaus Sidelifters were heavy and not cost effective for commercial use. Steelbro in New Zealand bought the Klaus Transport business and further developed the Sidelifter, resulting in reduced tare weight and allowing freight companies to legally carry higher payload. It was also developed by Hammar Maskin AB in Sweden. It has since become a commonly used vehicle in intermodal facilities worldwide. The principal alternative to the costly machinery of the sidelifter is the use of swap body containers, which are too light to be stacked but can be unloaded from a truck by means of foldable legs.

==Design==
Sidelifters generally have the following attributes:
* Lifting cranes (sometimes called Crane Modules). The hydraulically powered cranes lift the container (from the ground, loading dock, another vehicle, railway wagon or from the top of another container placed on the ground or other location) on and off the chassis. These cranes are placed on top of the sidelifter chassis and they are normally able to travel along the chassis being shifted by hydraulic cylinders or hydraulic motors in order to load varying container lengths.
* A power source. While typically the cranes are powered by a trailer mounted diesel engine or gasoline engine, the cranes are sometimes powered via a PTO from the truck or tractor.
* Stabilizing legs. These are fitted with hydraulic legs which are necessary to permit the lifting fully laden shipping containers without tilting the vehicle. These may be adjustable to assist operation on unlevel ground and facilitate greater safety margins and load limits when stacking containers. When lifting containers in confined locations or from rail wagons or trailer decks, tilting and extending legs provide additional capability.
* Chains, which are attached from the top of the cranes to the corner castings at the base of the container(s) during lifting operations. There is a special linking device that when placed between two 20 ft containers allows the user to lock two 20 ft (2 TEUs) containers together allowing the sidelifter to lift them as if they were a 40 ft container.
* The tractor/cab, which pulls the trailer, and in some cases supplies power through the PTO.This tractor/cab always supplies the compressed air for the wheels&#x27; brakes of the sidelifter. Normally, the sidelifter can not be operated without being connected to the Tractor because even if the power pack is under the sidelifter, the tractor provides compressed air for the trailer brakes and also additional stability for the lifting operation.
* The chassis, which bears the weight of the container when loaded, as well as supports the cranes.
* The remote control, a device with joysticks &amp; buttons typically attached via a multi-pair electric wire or via a radio signal and that allows the operator to walk around the container and view the unit from various angles during operation.

Sidelifter machines were designed to lift a maximum of . More recent designs lift though smaller machines are also available where a lighter tare weight is important.

In addition to controlling the raising and lowering of the cranes, the operator can sometimes tilt the chassis using the stabilising legs which provides a limited ability to operate on non-level ground.

Some sidelifters have a telescopic chassis, sometimes called trombone chassis, allowing the unit to expand and contract in order to accommodate 20 ft, 40 ft or even 45 ft containers. These Trombone units are specially suited for small secondary roads where cornering is quite difficult with 40 ft trailers.

==Safety==
A sidelifter is rated for ISO containers with a specified maximum total weight and to a maximum distance from the sidelifter chassis (also called maximum reach or maximum radius). This information is located on a nameplate provided by the manufacturer, and loads must not exceed these specifications. Sidelifter units have been known to overturn like any other crane, especially when lifting weights that are heavier than the maximum allowed weight or when operating at a radius that is bigger than the maximum allowed radius. Sidelifter units must always be operated only by trained personnel. Safety devices such as Electronic Stability System that prevent the sidelifter from rolling over may be sometimes required by local legislation. Safetywear for the operator and any assistants can include top and bottom reflector gear including a green or orange reflector vest and hard hat. In some jurisdictions safety goggles are required to protect against debris that can fall from containers.

==Alternatives==

A Rubber tyred gantry crane is another device for loading containers on to trucks (as well as around the port) although these are not road-going so must be in place at every destination that containers are to be delivered or collected at. As well a general purpose tilt deck truck (also called a tilt tray, rollback or a slide) equipped with a winch can load/unload a 20-foot container from the rear of the vehicle.

<text>Katherine Murray Millett (September 14, 1934 – September 6, 2017) was an American feminist writer, educator, artist, and activist. She attended the University of Oxford and was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors after studying at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford. She has been described as &quot;a seminal influence on second-wave feminism&quot;, and is best known for her book &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; (1970), which was based on her doctoral dissertation at Columbia University. Journalist Liza Featherstone attributes the attainment of previously unimaginable &quot;legal abortion, greater professional equality between the sexes, and a sexual freedom&quot; in part to Millett&#x27;s efforts.

The feminist, human rights, peace, civil rights, and anti-psychiatry movements were some of Millett&#x27;s principal causes. Her books were motivated by her activism, such as woman&#x27;s rights and mental health reform, and several were autobiographical memoirs that explored her sexuality, mental health, and relationships. In the 1960s and 1970s, Millett taught at Waseda University, Bryn Mawr College, Barnard College, and the University of California, Berkeley. Some of her later written works are &quot;The Politics of Cruelty&quot; (1994), about state-sanctioned torture in many countries, and &quot;Mother Millett&quot; (2001), a book about her relationship with her mother. Between 2011 and 2013, she won the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature, received Yoko Ono&#x27;s Courage Award for the Arts, and was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Millett was born and raised in Minnesota, and then spent most of her adult life in Manhattan and the Woman&#x27;s Art Colony, established in Poughkeepsie, New York, which became the Millett Center for the Arts in 2012. Millett came out as a lesbian in 1970, the year the book &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; was published. However, late in the year 1970 she came out as bisexual. She was married to sculptor Fumio Yoshimura (1965 to 1985) and later, until her death in 2017, she was married to Sophie Keir.

==Early life and education==
Katherine Murray Millett was born on September 14, 1934, to James Albert and Helen () Millett in Saint Paul, Minnesota. According to Millett, she was afraid of her father, an engineer, who beat her. He was an alcoholic who abandoned the family when she was 14, &quot;consigning them to a life of poverty&quot;. Her mother was a teacher and insurance saleswoman. She had two sisters, Sally and Mallory; the latter was one of the subjects of &quot;Three Lives&quot;. Of Irish Catholic heritage, Kate Millett attended parochial schools in Saint Paul throughout her childhood.

Millett graduated in 1956 magna cum laude from the University of Minnesota with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature; she was a member of the Kappa Alpha Theta sorority. A wealthy aunt paid for her education at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford, gaining an English literature first-class honors degree in 1958. She was the first American woman to be awarded a degree with first-class honors having studied at St. Hilda&#x27;s. After spending about 10 years as an educator and artist, Millett entered the graduate school program for English and comparative literature at Columbia University in 1968, during which she taught English at Barnard. While there, she championed student rights, women&#x27;s liberation, and abortion reform. She completed her dissertation in September 1969 and was awarded her doctorate, with distinction, in March 1970.

==Career==

===Early career as an artist and educator===

Millett taught English at the University of North Carolina after graduating from Oxford University, but she left mid-semester to study art.

In New York City she worked as a kindergarten teacher and learned to sculpt and paint from 1959 to 1961. She then moved to Japan and studied sculpture. Millett met fellow sculptor Fumio Yoshimura, had her first one-woman show at Tokyo&#x27;s Minami Gallery, and taught English at Waseda University. She left Japan in 1963 and moved to New York&#x27;s Lower East Side.

Millett taught English and exhibited her works of art at Barnard College beginning in 1964. She was among a group of young, radical, and untenured educators who wanted to modernize women&#x27;s education; Millett wanted to provide them with &quot;the critical tools necessary to understand their position in a patriarchal society.&quot; Her viewpoints on radical politics, her &quot;stinging attack&quot; against Barnard in &quot;Token Learning&quot;, and a budget cut at the college led to her being dismissed on December 23, 1968. Her artwork was featured in an exhibit at Greenwich Village&#x27;s Judson Gallery. During these years Millett became interested in the peace and Civil Rights Movement, joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), and participated in their protests.

In 1971, Millett taught sociology at Bryn Mawr College. She started buying and restoring property that year, near Poughkeepsie, New York; this became the Women&#x27;s Art Colony and Tree Farm, a community of women artists and writers and Christmas tree farm. Two years later she was an educator at the University of California, Berkeley.

=== The 1980s through 2000s ===

In 1980, Millett was one of the ten invited artists whose work was exhibited in the Great American Lesbian Art Show at the Woman&#x27;s Building in Los Angeles, although Millett identified as bisexual. Millett was also a contributor to &quot;On the Issues&quot; magazine, and continued writing into the early 2000s. She discussed state-sanctioned torture in &quot;The Politics of Cruelty&quot; (1994), bringing attention to the use of torture in many countries.

Millett was involved in the controversy resulting from her appearance on a UK television programme called &quot;After Dark&quot;. Actor Oliver Reed, who had been drinking during the programme, moved in on her and tried to kiss her. Millett pushed him away but reportedly later asked for a tape of the show to entertain her friends. Throughout the programme Reed used sexist language.

Millett was also involved in prison reform and campaigns against torture. Journalist Maureen Freely wrote of Millett&#x27;s viewpoint regarding activism in her later years: &quot;The best thing about being a is that she can say what she pleases because &#x27;nobody&#x27;s giving me a chair in anything. I&#x27;m too old, mean and ornery. Everything depends on how well you argue. In 2012, The Women&#x27;s Art Colony became a 501(c)3 non-profit organization and changed its name to the Millett Center for the Arts.

== Activism ==

=== Feminism ===
Millett was a leading figure in the women&#x27;s movement, or second-wave feminism, of the 1960s and 1970s. For example, she and Sidney Abbott, Phyllis Birkby, Alma Routsong, and Artemis March were among the members of CR One, the first lesbian-feminist consciousness-raising group, although Millett identified as bisexual by late 1970.

In 1966, Millett became a committee member of National Organization for Women and subsequently joined the New York Radical Women, Radical lesbians, and Downtown Radical Women organizations.

She contributed the piece &quot;Sexual politics (in literature)&quot; to the 1970 anthology &quot;Sisterhood Is Powerful: An Anthology of Writings from the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement&quot;, edited by Robin Morgan.

She became a spokesperson for the feminist movement following the success of the book &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; (1970), but struggled with conflicting perceptions of her as arrogant and elitist, and the expectations of others to speak for them, which she covered in her 1974 book, &quot;Flying&quot;.

Millett was one of the first writers to describe the modern concept of patriarchy as the society-wide subjugation of women. Biographer Gayle Graham Yates said that &quot;Millett articulated a theory of patriarchy and conceptualized the gender and sexual oppression of women in terms that demanded a sex role revolution with radical changes of personal and family lifestyles&quot;. Betty Friedan&#x27;s focus, by comparison, was to improve leadership opportunities socially and politically and economic independence for women.

Millett wrote several books on women&#x27;s lives from a feminist perspective. For instance, in the book &quot;The Basement: Meditations on a Human Sacrifice&quot; (1979), completed over four years, she chronicled the torture and murder of Indianapolis teenager Sylvia Likens by Gertrude Baniszewski in 1965 that had preoccupied her for 14 years. With a feminist perspective, she explored the story of the defenseless girl and the dynamics of the individuals involved in her sexual, physical and emotional abuse. Biographer Roberta M. Hooks wrote, &quot;Quite apart from any feminist polemics, &quot;The Basement&quot; can stand alone as an intensely felt and movingly written study of the problems of cruelty and submission.&quot; Millett said of the motivation of the perpetrator: &quot;It is the story of the suppression of women. Gertrude seems to have wanted to administer some terrible truthful justice to this girl: that this was what it was to be a woman&quot;.

Millett and Sophie Keir, a Canadian journalist, traveled to Tehran, Iran in 1979 for the Committee for Artistic and Intellectual Freedom to work for Iranian women&#x27;s rights. Their trip followed actions taken by Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s government to prevent girls from attending schools with boys, to require working women to wear veils, and not to allow women to divorce their husbands. Thousands of women attended a protest rally held at Tehran University on International Women&#x27;s Day, March 8. About 20,000 women attended a march through the city&#x27;s Freedom Square; many of whom were stabbed, beaten, or threatened with acid. Millett and Keir, who had attended the rallies and demonstrations, were removed from their hotel room and taken to a locked room in immigration headquarters two weeks after they arrived in Iran. They were threatened that they might be put in jail and, knowing that homosexuals were executed in Iran, Millett also feared she might be killed when she overheard officials say that she was a lesbian. After an overnight stay, the women were put on a plane that landed in Paris. Although Millett was relieved to have arrived safely in France, she was worried about the fate of Iranian women left behind, &quot;They can&#x27;t get on a plane. That&#x27;s why international sisterhood is so important.&quot; She wrote about the experience in her 1982 book &quot;Going to Iran&quot;. Millett is featured in the feminist history film &quot;She&#x27;s Beautiful When She&#x27;s Angry&quot; (2014).

== Academic works ==

===&quot;Sexual Politics&quot;===

&quot;Sexual Politics&quot; originated as Millett&#x27;s PhD dissertation and was published in 1970, the same year that she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing the traditional family was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement&#x27;s manifesto.

As a symbol of the women&#x27;s liberation movement, Millett was featured in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover story, &quot;The Politics of Sex&quot;, which called &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; a &quot;remarkable book&quot; that provided a coherent theory about the feminist movement. Alice Neel created the depiction of Millett for the August 31, 1970, cover.

According to biographer Peter Manso, &quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot; was written by Norman Mailer in response to Millett&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Politics&quot;. Andrew Wilson, author of &quot;Norman Mailer: An American Aesthetic&quot;, noted that &quot;&quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot; is structured as a contest. His rhetoric against her prose, his charm against her earnestness, his polemic rage against her vitriolic charges. The aim is to convert the larger audience, the stronger presence as the sustaining truth. &quot;The Prisoner of Sex&quot; combines self parody and satire...&quot;

===Sexism and sexuality===
While Millett was speaking about sexual liberation at Columbia University, a woman in the audience asked her, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you say you&#x27;re a lesbian, here, openly. You&#x27;ve said you were a lesbian in the past.&quot; Millett hesitantly responded, &quot;Yes, I am a lesbian&quot;. A couple of weeks later, &quot;Time&quot; December 8, 1970, article &quot;Women&#x27;s Lib: A Second Look&quot; reported that Millett admitted she was bisexual, which it said would likely discredit her as a spokesperson for the feminist movement because it &quot;reinforce[d] the views of those skeptics who routinely dismiss all liberationists as lesbians.&quot; In response, a press conference was organized two days later in Greenwich Village by lesbian feminists Ivy Bottini and Barbara Love. It led to a statement in which 30 lesbian and feminist leaders declared their &quot;solidarity with the struggle of homosexuals to attain their liberation in a sexist society&quot;.

Millett&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Three Lives&quot; is a 16 mm documentary made by an all-woman crew, including co-director Susan Kleckner, cameraperson Lenore Bode, and editor Robin Mide, under the name Women&#x27;s Liberation Cinema. The 70-minute film focuses on three women—Mallory Millett-Jones, the director&#x27;s sister; Lillian Shreve, a chemist; and Robin Mide, an artist—reminiscing about their lives. Vincent Canby, &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ art critic, wrote: &quot;&quot;Three Lives&quot; is a good, simple movie in that it can&#x27;t be bothered to call attention to itself, only to its three subjects, and to how they grew in the same male-dominated society that Miss Millett, in her &quot;Sexual Politics&quot;, so systematically tore apart, shook up, ridiculed and undermined—while, apparently, tickling it pink.&quot; It received &quot;generally excellent reviews&quot; following its premiere at a New York City theater.

In her 1971 book &quot;The Prostitution Papers&quot;, Millett interprets prostitution as residing at the core of the female&#x27;s condition, exposing women&#x27;s subjection more clearly than is done with marriage contracts. According to her, degradation and power, not sex, are being bought and sold in prostitution. She argues for the decriminalization of prostitution in a process directed by the sex workers themselves.
In 1974 and 1977, respectively, Millett published two autobiographical books. &quot;Flying&quot; (1974), a &quot;stream-of-consciousness memoir about her bisexuality&quot;, which explores her life after the success of &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; in what was described in &quot;The New York Times Book Review&quot; as an example of &quot;dazzling exhibitionism&quot;. Millett captured life as she thought, experienced and lived it, in a style like a documentary film. &quot;Sita&quot; (1977) explores her sexuality, particularly her lesbian lover who committed suicide and the effect on Millett&#x27;s personal and private life. Millett and Sidney Abbott, Phyllis Birkby, Alma Routsong, and Artemis March were among the members of CR One, the first lesbian-feminist consciousness-raising group.

=== Views on pedophilia ===
In an interview with Mark Blasius, Millett was sympathetic to the concept of intergenerational sex, describing age of consent laws as &quot;very oppressive&quot; to gay male youth in particular but repeatedly reminding the interviewer that the question cannot rest on the sexual access of older men or women to children but a rethinking of children&#x27;s rights broadly understood. Millett added that &quot;one of children&#x27;s essential rights is to express themselves sexually, probably primarily with each other but with adults as well&quot; and that &quot;the sexual freedom of children is an important part of a sexual revolution ... if you don&#x27;t change the social condition of children you still have an inescapable inequality&quot;. In this interview, Millett criticized those who wished to abolish age of consent laws, saying the issue was not focused on children&#x27;s rights but &quot;being approached as the right of men to have sex with kids below the age of consent&quot; and added that &quot;no mention is made of relationships between women and girls&quot;.

===&quot;Mother Millett&quot;===
Kate wrote &quot;Mother Millett&quot; (2001) about her mother, who in her later years developed several serious health problems, including a brain tumor and hypercalcaemia. Made aware of her mother&#x27;s declining health, Millett visited her in Minnesota; their visits included conversations about their relationship and outings to baseball games, museums, and restaurants. When her mother was no longer able to care for herself in her apartment, she was placed in a nursing home in St. Paul, Minnesota, which was one of Helen Millett&#x27;s greatest fears. Kate visited her mother and was disturbed by the care she received and her mother&#x27;s demoralized attitude. Nursing home residents who were labeled as &quot;behavioral problems&quot;, as Helen was, were subject to forcible restraint. Helen said to Kate, &quot;Now that you&#x27;re here, we can leave.&quot;

Aware of the efforts her mother made to give her life, support her and raise her, Millett became a care-giver and coordinator of many daily therapies, and pushed her mother to be active. She wanted to give her &quot;independence and dignity&quot;. In the article &quot;Her Mother, Herself&quot;, Pat Swift wrote: &quot;Helen Millett might have been content to go &quot;gently into that good night&quot;—she was after all more afraid of the nursing home than dying—but daughter Kate was having none of that. Feminist warrior, human rights activists, gay liberationist, writer and artist, Kate Millett has not gone gently through life and never hesitates to rage at anyone—friend or foe, family or the system—to right a perceived wrong. When the dignity and quality of her ailing mother&#x27;s life was at stake, this book&#x27;s unfolding tale became inevitable.&quot; Even though Helen played a role in having her daughter committed to the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Mayo wing, Kate had her mother removed from the nursing home and returned to her apartment, where attendants managed her care. During this period, Millett could also &quot;bully&quot; her mother for her lack of cultural sophistication and the amount of television she watched and could be harsh with caregivers.

==Personal life==
===Interpersonal relationships===
Millett was not the &quot;polite, middle-class girl&quot; that many parents of her generation and social circle desired; she could be difficult, brutally honest, and tenacious. Liza Featherstone, author of &quot;Daughterhood Is Powerful&quot;, says that these qualities helped to make her &quot;one of the most influential radical feminists of the 1970s.&quot; They could also make for difficult interpersonal relationships. Millett wrote several autobiographical memoirs, with what Featherstone calls &quot;brutal honesty,&quot; about herself, her husband, lovers, and family. Her relationship with her mother was strained by her radical politics, domineering personality, and unconventional lifestyle. Helen was particularly upset about examination of her lesbianism in her books. (Millett identified as bisexual by late 1970.) Family relationships were further strained after Millett was involuntarily committed to psychiatric wards and again when she wrote &quot;The Loony Bin Trip&quot;.

Millett focused on her mother in &quot;Mother Millett&quot;, a book about how she was made aware by her sister Sally of the seriousness of Helen Millett&#x27;s declining health and poor nursing home care. Kate removed her mother from the home and returned her to an apartment, where caregivers managed her health and comfort. In the book, &quot;Millett writes about the situation—her mother&#x27;s distance and imperiousness, her family&#x27;s failure to recognize the humanity of the old and the insane—with brutal honesty. Yet she also describes moments of forgiveness, humility and admiration.&quot; During this time, she developed a close relationship, previously inconceivable, with her mother, which she considered &quot;a miracle and a grace, a gift.&quot; Her relationships with her sisters were troubled during this time, but they all came to support their mother&#x27;s apartment-living. The suggestion of her role as the heroine in &quot;Mother Millett&quot;, however, may have been &quot;at the expense of her two siblings&quot;.

===Marriage===
In 1961 Millett moved to Japan and met fellow sculptor Fumio Yoshimura. In 1963 Yoshimura and Millett left Japan and moved to New York&#x27;s Lower East Side in the Bowery district. In 1965 they married to prevent Yoshimura from being deported, and during their marriage Millett said that they were &quot;friends and lovers&quot;. She dedicated her book &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; to him. Author Estelle C. Jelinek says that during their marriage he &quot;loves her, leads his own creative life, and accepts her woman lovers&quot;. In 1985 they were divorced. At the time of her death, Millett had recently married Sophie Keir, her partner for 39 years.

===Mental illness===
Mental illness affected Millett&#x27;s personal and professional life from 1973, when she lived with her husband in California and was an activist and teacher at the University of California, Berkeley. Yoshimura and Sally, Kate&#x27;s eldest sister, became concerned about Kate&#x27;s extreme emotions. Her family claimed that she went for as many as five consecutive nights without sleep and could talk nonsensically for hours. During a screening of one of her films at University of California, Berkeley, Millett &quot;began talking incoherently&quot;. According to her other sister, Mallory Millett-Danaher, &quot;There were pained looks of confusion in the audience, then people whispered and slowly got up to leave.&quot; Sally, who was a law student in Nebraska, signed papers to have her younger sister committed. Millett was forcefully taken and held in psychiatric facilities for ten days. She signed herself out using a release form intended for voluntary admissions. During a visit to St. Paul, Minnesota, a couple of weeks later, her mother asked Kate to visit a psychiatrist and, based upon the psychiatrist&#x27;s suggestion, signed commitment papers for Kate. She was released within three days, having won a sanity trial, due to the efforts of her friends and a &quot;pro bono&quot; attorney.

Following the two involuntary confinements, Millett became depressed, particularly so about having been confined without due process. While in the mental hospitals, she was given &quot;mind-altering&quot; drugs or restrained, depending upon whether she complied or not. She was stigmatized for having been committed and diagnosed with manic depression (now commonly called bipolar disorder). The diagnosis affected how she was perceived by others and her ability to attain employment. In California doctors had recommended that she take lithium to manage wide manic and depression swings. Her depression became more severe when her housing in the Bowery was condemned and Yoshimura threatened divorce. To manage the depression, Millett again began taking lithium.

In 1980, with support of two friends and photojournalist Sophie Keir, Millett stopped taking lithium to improve her mental clarity, relieve diarrhea and hand tremors, and better uphold her philosophies about mental health and treatment. She began to feel alienated and was &quot;snappish&quot; as Keir watched for behavioral changes. Her behavior was that of psychiatric drug withdrawal, including &quot;mile-a-minute&quot; speech, which turned her peaceful art colony to &quot;a quarrelsome dystopia.&quot; Mallory Millett, having talked to Keir, tried to get her committed but was unsuccessful due to New York&#x27;s laws concerning involuntary commitments.

Millett visited Ireland in the fall of 1980 as an activist. Upon her intended return to the United States, there was a delay at the airport and she extended her stay in Ireland. She was involuntarily committed in Ireland after airport security &quot;determined from someone in New York&quot; that she had a &quot;mental illness&quot; and had stopped taking lithium. While confined, she was heavily drugged. To combat the aggressive pharmaceutical program of &quot;the worst bin of all&quot;, she counteracted the effects of Thorazine and lithium by eating a lot of oranges or hid the pills in her mouth for later disposal. She said of the times when she was committed, &quot;To remain sane in a bin is to defy its definition,&quot; she said.

After several days, she was found by her friend Margaretta D&#x27;Arcy. With the assistance of an Irish parliament member and a therapist-psychiatrist from Dublin, Millett was declared competent and released within several weeks. She returned to the United States, became severely depressed, and began taking lithium again. In 1986, Millett stopped taking lithium without adverse reactions. After one lithium-free year, Millett announced the news to stunned family and friends.

Millett&#x27;s involvement with psychiatry caused her to attempt suicide several times due to both damaging physical and emotional effects but also because of the slanderous nature of psychiatric labeling that affected her reputation and threatened her very existence in the world. She believed that her depression was due to grief and feeling broken. She said, &quot;When you have been told that your mind is unsound, there is a kind of despair that takes over...&quot; In &quot;The Loony Bin Trip&quot;, Millett wrote that she dreaded her depressed periods:

Feminist author and historian Marilyn Yalom wrote that &quot;Millett refuses the labels that would declare her insane&quot;, continuing &quot;she conveys the paranoid terror of being judged cruelly by others for what seems to the afflicted person to be a reasonable act.&quot;

====Activism====

Angered by institutional psychiatric practices and lenient involuntary commitment processes, Millett became an activist. With her lawyer, she changed the State of Minnesota&#x27;s commitment law so that a trial is required before a person is involuntarily committed.

Millett was active in the anti-psychiatry movement. As a representative of MindFreedom International, she spoke out against psychiatric torture at the United Nations during the negotiations of the text of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2005).

In 1978, Millett became an associate of the Women&#x27;s Institute for Freedom of the Press (WIFP). WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

===Bowery redevelopment===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Millett was involved in a dispute with the New York City authorities, who wanted to evict her from her home at 295 Bowery as part of a massive redevelopment plan. Millett and other tenants held out but ultimately lost their battle. Their building was demolished, and the residents were relocated.

==Scholarship==
Kristan Poirot, author of &quot;Mediating a Movement, Authorizing Discourse&quot;, says that the release of Millett&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; (1970) was a pivotal event in the second wave of the feminist movement. Although there were other important moments in the movement, like the founding of the National Organization for Women and release of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; by Betty Friedan, it was in 1970 that the media gave greater attention to the feminist movement, first with a front-page article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and coverage on the three network&#x27;s news programs about the Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality event that summer. Millett used psychology, anthropology, the sexual revolution, and literary criticism to explain her theory of sexual politics, which is that western societies have been driven by a belief that men are superior to women. According to Poirot, the book, which received widespread media coverage, &quot;was considered to be the first book-length exposition of second wave radical feminist theory.&quot; Published accounts of Millett&#x27;s lesbianism played a part in the fracture in the feminist movement over lesbians&#x27; role within the movement and reduced her effectiveness as a women&#x27;s rights activist. However, Millett identified as bisexual by late 1970. Scholar Camille Paglia described Millett&#x27;s scholarship as deeply flawed, declaring that &quot;American feminism&#x27;s nose dive began&quot; when Millett achieved prominence. According to Paglia, Millett&#x27;s &quot;Sexual Politics&quot; &quot;reduced complex artworks to their political content and attacked famous male artists and authors for their alleged sexism,&quot; thereby sending serious academic literary appreciation and criticism into eclipse.

Millett wrote her autobiographical books &quot;Flying&quot; (1974) and &quot;Sita&quot; (1977) about coming out as gay, partly an important consciousness-raising activity. She realized beginning an open dialogue is important to break down the isolation and alienation that hiding in privacy can cause. She wrote in &quot;Flying&quot; what Alice Henry calls in her &quot;off our backs&quot; review of &quot;Sita&quot; an &quot;excruciating public and political &#x27;coming out&#x27;&quot; and its effect on her personal, political, and artistic lives. While she discussed some of her love affairs in &quot;Flying&quot;, in &quot;Sita&quot; she provides insight into a lesbian love affair and her fears of being alone or inadequate. Henry writes, &quot;Kate&#x27;s transparent vulnerability and attempts to get to the root of herself and grasp her lover are typical of many women who love women.&quot;

Millett recorded her visit to Iran and the demonstrations by Iranian feminists against the fundamentalist shift in Iran politics under Khomeini&#x27;s government. Her book &quot;Going to Iran&quot;, with photography by Sophie Keir (1979), is &quot;a rare and therefore valuable eyewitness account of a series of important developments in the history of Iranian women&quot;, albeit told from the perspective of a feminist from the western world.

==Death==
Millett died in Paris on September 6, 2017, from cardiac arrest, eight days before her 83rd birthday. Her spouse Sophie Keir was with her at the time of her death.

==Awards and honors==
Millett won the Best Books Award for &quot;Mother Millett&quot; from Library Journal in 2001. In 2012, she was awarded one of that year&#x27;s Courage Award for the Arts by Yoko Ono, which Ono created to &quot;recognize artists, musicians, collectors, curators, writers—those who sought the truth in their work and had the courage to stick to it, no matter what&quot; and &quot;honor their work as an expression of my vision of courage&quot;. Between 2011 and 2012, she was also awarded the Lambda Pioneer Award for Literature and a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2012). She was honored in the summer of 2011 at a Veteran Feminists of America gala; attendees included feminists such as Susan Brownmiller and Gloria Steinem.

In March 2013, the U.S. National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame announced that Millett was to be among the institution&#x27;s 2013 inductees. Beverly P. Ryder, board of directors co-president, said that Millett was a &quot;real pillar of the women&#x27;s movement&quot;. The induction ceremony took place on October 24, 2013, at the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame headquarters in Seneca Falls, New York.

<text>The Mauritius Command is the fourth naval historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O&#x27;Brian, first published in 1977.

Aubrey is married and the father of twin girls, owner of a cottage with a fine observatory he built. He is more than ready to be back at sea. He and Stephen Maturin join a convoy charged with taking two strategic islands in the Indian Ocean from the French. The mission provides scope for each man to advance in his specialty.

A review written at first publication found the novel to be written in &quot;language deep with detail and the poetry of fact&quot;, appreciating the period detail. A later review, written at the reissue, finds the author a graceful writer but sees a difficulty with the novel&#x27;s structure, building to climaxes that do not occur. Others writing at that time saw the novel more as part of the longer series, with humour, erudition and &quot;impeccable period detail&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Four years after the events of &quot;HMS Surprise&quot;, Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams are married and the parents of twin girls. They live at Ashgrove Cottage on his half-pay, which is not enough to support fellow navy men in the household. Sophia&#x27;s mother has lost her money, including Sophia&#x27;s portion, and now lives with them, along with Sophia&#x27;s niece Cecelia.

When Stephen Maturin comes to call, Jack admits to him that as much as he loves his family he is eager to return to sea again. Stephen mentions that he has recommended Jack to lead a new secret commission being planned by the Admiralty. Moments later, a courier delivers Aubrey&#x27;s orders from the port Admiral. Jack is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS &quot;Boadicea&quot; and requested to depart immediately for Plymouth, where he picks up Mr R T Farquhar, a diplomat, and receives further orders to sail to the British station at Cape Town, where the ships of a convoy destined for the Indian Ocean will meet. Not long after embarking, they meet the French ship &quot;Hébé&quot; escorting a captured merchant ship. The &quot;Boadicea&quot; captures both ships and Jack sends the prizes to Gibraltar. The timely capture gives &quot;Boadicea&quot; the opportunity to send letters home, and the ship gains a French cook and the &quot;Hébé&quot; English prisoners, all able seamen. The long journey south through the Atlantic gives Jack time to bring the crew of the &quot;Boadicea&quot; up to his standards of efficiency in gunnery and gives Maturin and Farquhar time to develop their political strategies.

At Cape Town, Aubrey meets Admiral Bertie, who confirms Aubrey&#x27;s elevation to Commodore and authorises him to hoist his broad pendant (&#x27;broad pennant&#x27; in some editions) as commander of a small fleet with formal orders to disrupt French interests in the Indian Ocean and ultimately to capture the French-held islands of Mauritius and La Réunion. British stations in the region are short of ships and men, leaving the expedition poorly matched against the local French forces. Jack&#x27;s subordinate captains include Lord Clonfert of the &quot;Otter&quot;, an insecure Englishman with an Irish title; Captain Corbett of the &quot;Néréide&quot;, whose reputation for excessive flogging has left his ship severely undermanned; and Captain Pym of the &quot;Sirius&quot;. Jack learns that his loyal coxswain Bonden and steward Killick sailed from the West Indies under Corbett, so he trades men with &quot;Néréide&quot; to bring them aboard &quot;Boadicea&quot;. Bertie advises Aubrey that none of his captains are on good terms with each other.

For the first 2,000 miles of the voyage to the islands, Jack switches his pendant to the elderly 64-gun ship of the line HMS &quot;Raisonnable&quot;. The &quot;Caroline&quot; is taken and renamed HMS &quot;Bourbonnaise&quot;, and Corbett sails her with despatches to Cape Town and England. The rest of the convoy returns to Cape Town. Jack shifts back to &quot;Boadicea&quot; and sails again upon hearing that more merchant ships have been taken by the French. The convoy is caught in a major tropical cyclone, whence it sails back to Cape Town for repairs, receiving the first mail in many months; Sophia&#x27;s letters are water-damaged and Jack tries to make sense of them.

Aubrey organizes an attack on La Réunion with help from the active and decisive Lieutenant Colonel Harry Keating and his army regulars stationed on Rodrigues. La Réunion capitulates almost without loss after simultaneous landings by army troops and sepoys from the British East India Company on both sides of the island. The occupation is made easier by Stephen&#x27;s propaganda and political meetings, which help to convince many of the disaffected locals to accept British rule and Farquhar as interim Governor.

Mauritius proves more challenging. Stephen is seriously injured in an accident boarding &quot;Néréide&quot;, now under Lord Clonfert, which is part of the force sent to capture the strategic Île de la Passe off the island&#x27;s southeast coast. While recuperating, Stephen and the ship&#x27;s doctor, McAdam, attempt to diagnose Clonfert, whose self-consciousness and perceived rivalry with Commodore Aubrey has greatly affected his behavior. The capture of the fortress on Île de la Passe is successful and Stephen is put down on Mauritius to continue his work. A small group of transports under the command of Captain Pym puts soldiers on Mauritius to garrison the fortress. The French fleet then appears with three frigates, &quot;Bellone&quot;, &quot;Minerve&quot;, and &quot;Victor&quot;, and two captured Indiamen, &quot;Ceylon&quot; and &quot;Windham&quot;. They boldly attack the fort and then sail into the channel leading to Port South East; the British ships are caught unprepared but decide to attack. The battle rages for days with heavy casualties, and in the end two British ships, &quot;Sirius&quot; and &quot;Magicienne&quot;, run aground in the shallow channel and cannot be heaved off, so are burnt to prevent their capture; &quot;Iphigenia&quot; and the fort at Île de la Passe are abandoned to be retaken by the French. &quot;Néréide&quot; is also captured and Clonfert is gravely wounded in the neck and head by a splinter. A messenger vessel, with Maturin aboard, reaches La Réunion to inform Aubrey of the losses and the failed attack on Port South East.

&quot;Boadicea&quot; sails through the night to Île de la Passe only to find it under French control, then chases &quot;Manche&quot; and &quot;Vénus&quot; in a vain attempt to separate them. After contacting Tom Pullings, who has moved the guns of &quot;Windham&quot; aboard &quot;Emma&quot;, Jack believes his fortunes have changed. Captain Corbett re-joins at Saint Denis in command of HMS &quot;Africaine&quot;. Chasing the French during the night, &quot;Africaine&quot; clashes with the &quot;Astrée&quot; and the captured &quot;Iphigenia&quot;. The encounter goes badly and Corbett is mortally wounded during the fight, possibly by his own oppressed men. The French capture the &quot;Africaine&quot;, but leave it dismasted when the &quot;Boadicea&quot; bears down on them; &quot;Astrée&quot; refuses an engagement. Joined by the &quot;Otter&quot; and &quot;Staunch&quot;, the flotilla returns to La Réunion where the Commodore hastens to refit &quot;Africaine&quot;.

Maturin and Bonden return from Mauritius with news that HMS &quot;Bombay&quot; is nearby, in a running fight with both the French &quot;Vénus&quot; and &quot;Victor&quot;. The &quot;Boadicea&quot; engages the French ships, with Jack making use of eager volunteers from the &quot;Africaine&quot; to board and capture &quot;Bombay&quot; and &quot;Vénus&quot;. During the encounter the French Commodore, Hamelin, is killed. While waiting for repairs, Aubrey and Keating devise a plan to finish the battle with the remaining French frigates. Suddenly the &quot;Emma&quot; signals the &quot;Boadicea&quot; that many other British sails are on the horizon, and Jack realizes Admiral Bertie has arrived to supersede his command. Tom Pullings comes aboard with a copy of the &quot;Naval Gazette&quot; announcing the birth of a son to Sophia; Jack is ecstatic at the news. He then opens Bertie&#x27;s letter ordering him to join the fleet at Rodrigues, where he will command HMS &quot;Illustrious&quot;, and the Army led by General Abercrombie. Jack is disappointed that he will no longer have the honor of leading the fleet, but accepts the orders with magnanimity, to Bertie&#x27;s surprise. The final invasion of Mauritius, based on Aubrey and Keating&#x27;s original plan, is an overwhelming victory, and the French surrender after being given honourable terms.

Stephen learns from McAdam that Clonfert, at the military hospital in Port Louis, has committed suicide by removing his bandages, unable to face Jack Aubrey. Stephen asks McAdam&#x27;s advice on how to overcome his own recent disaffection and apathy, and McAdam insists that only romantic relationships seem to consistently remedy such maladies. A ceremonial dinner is given at Government House on Mauritius. Stephen implies in conversation with Mr Peter that Jack&#x27;s father, General Aubrey, is soon to have significant influence with the Admiralty in London, which rumours are believed by Bertie. The Admiral gives Jack the great honour of returning to England carrying the news of the British victory.

==Major themes==

The novel gives further scope to Maturin&#x27;s role as both a secret agent (in which he uses propaganda effectively to support the British campaign) and as a naturalist (in which he is seen collecting relics of the extinct dodo and solitaire), while Aubrey for the first time experiences naval battles as the &quot;looker-on&quot; while others are directly in the fight. Aubrey makes strategic decisions and knows the timing of when to act, but must learn how to manage other captains, not only the crew directly reporting to him. One theme is the contrast between Aubrey&#x27;s development in his career and acceptance of what comes, to the insecurity of Clonfert, also a skilled seaman, who had been with him in the West Indies when neither had been &quot;given his step&quot; to commander or captain.

Walton comments that &quot;The most interesting thing about this volume is Lord Clonfert, an Irish peer who feels the need to outdo everyone—his surgeon says at one point that if Jack is the dashing frigate captain, Clonfert has to be the dashing frigate captain to the power of ten. He’s ridiculous, he lies, but he is brave and does know the waters. And for once we hear Stephen and Jack discuss him, because he’s not a shipmate so Stephen doesn’t feel like an informer talking about him. He’s a psychological curiosity without any doubt, and O’Brian does him very well. There’s also the flogging Captain Corbett—so among his little fleet there’s one dandy and one tartar, and Jack has to try to manage them diplomatically.&quot;

==Allusions to history==
The military actions of the novel are very closely based upon the real-life Mauritius campaign of 1809–1811, carried out by the Royal Navy under Commodore Josias Rowley with the assistance of army forces under Harry Keating. O&#x27;Brian notes this in the preface. Réunion (known to the French as Île Bourbon or Île Buonaparte) was taken completely in July 1810, and Mauritius (known as Île de France, earlier called Mauritius by the Dutch) was formally captured on 3 December 1810. Many of the historical figures involved in the campaign are characters in the novel.

O&#x27;Brian used literary license in making Aubrey a Commodore while still a relatively junior captain, which puts him equal in rank to the man who actually led the squadron in history, Commodore Rowley. In the novel, Aubrey is appointed directly by the Admiralty thanks to Maturin&#x27;s persuasion, as Maturin had been at work on the intelligence side of the project. There are other differences from the historical events, one being that the French captain of the &quot;Vénus&quot;, Jacques Félix Emmanuel Hamelin, was not killed in action and actually survived the encounter, surrendering to the British and going on to honor in France. In contrast, Captain Corbett&#x27;s reputation and death aboard ship match that of Robert Corbet, who was captain of &quot;Néréide&quot; and then given the &quot;Africaine&quot; when he brought the captured &quot;Caroline&quot; to England. Corbet was killed under controversial circumstances during the action of 13 September 1810, which is depicted accurately in the novel.

Lord Clonfert is fictional, in place of Nesbit Willoughby, who was captain of the actual HMS &quot;Néréide&quot;; though Willoughby had a spotty career and took many wounds, he survived the battle and lived unmarried. Lord Clonfert takes the same splinter wound to the eye as Willoughby received during the Battle of Grand Port in August 1810. In the historical battle, Samuel Pym of the &quot;Sirius&quot; was taken prisoner by the French and released only when a later squadron from Cape Town re-took Île de la Passe in December 1810, freeing Pym and others taken prisoner. For the loss of his ship, Pym faced the usual court-martial but was exonerated of blame. In the novel, it is Captain Lord Clonfert who is left a prisoner in the action, seriously wounded, under the care of his own and French physicians until the squadron arrives under Admiral Bertie to accept the island&#x27;s capitulation, though Clonfert does not live to face a court-martial.

The ending of the novel, with Admiral Bertie sailing in and taking credit, also matches the historical event, as Bertie did in fact lead the victorious squadron in December 1810. Some historians have viewed the defeat at Grand Port as the most serious to the Royal Navy in all of the Napoleonic Wars; the interim defeat and very real loss of ships were overshadowed, however, by the conquest of the islands just a few months later. The French mark this victory on the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, the only naval action noted there. Though Aubrey expects no baronetcy for his accomplishments in the novel, in history, both Admiral Bertie and Commodore Rowley received a baronetcy in recognition of their success in a popular military campaign.

Historically a commodore indicated on which ship in his squadron he was sailing by showing his broad pendant (some editions have &#x27;broad pennant&#x27;).

It is mentioned in the novel that Aubrey makes the acquaintance at the Royal Society of Miss Caroline Herschel, famed astronomer and sister to William Herschel, and that she aided him in the technique of polishing the lens for his telescope. She was in her sixties during the time period depicted in the novel. In his development as a scientific sailor, Aubrey had presented a paper on his method for improving navigation by tracking the planets.

The island now called Réunion (French &quot;La Réunion&quot;) had several names in this era, including Île Bourbon and Île Buonaparte, reflecting the opposing sides in France. Bourbon was the name of the royal family deposed by the French Revolution and a way to refer to the royalists among the French; Napoleon Bonaparte was the emperor of the expanding French Empire. The French ship &quot;Caroline&quot; was rechristened as HMS &quot;Bourbonnaise&quot;, both because there was already a ship named Caroline in the Royal Navy, and the island where she was taken had that as one of its names.

The story of the Russian Captain Golovnin aboard the ship &quot;Diana&quot;, caught at a British port when the national alliances changed while he was sailing, refers to an historical situation which occurred in the same year that the squadron to take the two French islands was assembled.

==Allusions to literature==
The story contains numerous allusions to the ideas and thinking of others. At one point Aubrey is recorded &quot;adding, not without pride, &quot;Ex Africa surgit semper aliquid novo, – novi, eh?&quot;&quot; (&quot;Always something new coming out of Africa&quot;.) This is the popular version of a quotation from Pliny the Elder, &quot;unde etiam vulgare Graeciae dictum semper aliquid novi Africam adferre&quot;. Later, Maturin quotes the Earl of Rochester, &quot;Every man would be a coward if he durst&quot; (which he would have seen in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Eminent English Poets&quot;). Throughout the novel there are many other allusions and quotes, including some credited to Alexander Pope, Pliny the Elder, Samuel Johnson, Horace, Lewis Carroll, and from &quot;King Lear&quot; by Shakespeare.

==Literary significance and criticism==
&quot;Taken together, the novels are a brilliant achievement. They display staggering erudition on almost all aspects of early nineteenth century life, with impeccable period detail...[Compared to Forester&#x27;s characters] Aubrey and Maturin are subtler, richer items; in addition Patrick O&#x27;Brian has a gift for the comic which Forester lacks.

&quot;Jack&#x27;s assignment: to capture the Indian Ocean islands of Réunion and Mauritius from the French. That campaign forms the narrative thread of this rollicking sea saga. But its substance is more beguiling still...&quot; —Elizabeth Peer, Newsweek

&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; found the language of the novel to be &quot;shot through with unobtrusive culture and period texture that flows like a serenade&quot;. The characters are drawn well, with &quot;a crazy inner skip to their hearts&quot;, summing up the writing as having &quot;the poetry of fact on blue-water currents under the trades.&quot;

Reviews published at the re-issue in 1991 were favorable and detailed. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; found O&#x27;Brian to be &quot;a graceful writer, and the book is full of wonderful period details&quot;. The novel&#x27;s &quot;peculiar narrative structure&quot; suggests climaxes that do not happen. Richard Snow wrote in 1991 that he had read the novels from &quot;Master and Commander&quot; to &quot;Desolation Island&quot; from American publishers twenty years earlier. He enjoyed the happy ending of &quot;Master and Commander&quot; and was grateful for more, including &quot;a complex and fascinating successor [which] appeared -- &quot;The Mauritius Command&quot;.&quot; O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s &quot;portrayal of life aboard a sailing ship is vivid and authoritative&quot; and O&#x27;Brian presented &quot;the lost arcana of that hard-pressed, cruel, courageous world with an immediacy that makes its workings both comprehensible and fascinating.&quot; He noted too that &quot;behind the humor, behind the storms and the broadside duels . . . loomed something larger: the shape and texture of a whole era.&quot; As strong as the historical detail was, Snow remarked that &quot;in the end it is the serious exploration of human character that gives the books their greatest power&quot;, and he also referred to the poetry of the writing, saying that O&#x27;Brian &quot;manages to express, with the grace and economy of poetry, familiar things that somehow never get written down, as when he carefully details the rueful steps by which Stephen Maturin falls out of love.&quot; At this time of the re-issues of the novels by W W Norton in the US, Snow recommended that a reader start with the first and keep reading to the last one, then &quot;You will have read what I continue to believe are the best historical novels ever written.&quot;

Kevin Myers wrote in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; that &quot;O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s sheer brilliance as a writer constantly dazzles, and his power over the reader is unique. No writer alive can move one as O&#x27;Brian can; no one can make you laugh so loud with hilarity, whiten your knuckles with unbearable tension or choke with emotion. He is the master.&quot;

This novel was first issued in the UK in 1977 by Collins and in 1978 in the US by Stein &amp; Day. It was among the many re-issued in paperback by W W Norton in 1990–1991, 14 years after its initial publication by Collins (note list above). More reviewers read this book and others in the series, and the series gained a new audience.

The process of reissuing the novels prior to this novel and &quot;The Letter of Marque&quot; was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991.

Two of my favorite friends are fictitious characters; they live in more than a dozen volumes always near at hand. Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O&#x27;Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, &quot;Master and Commander,&quot; was published in 1970.

O&#x27;Brian&#x27;s British fans include T. J. Binyon, Iris Murdoch, A. S. Byatt, Timothy Mo and the late Mary Renault, but, until recently, this splendid saga of two serving officers in the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars was unavailable in this country, apart from the first few installments which went immediately out of print. Last year, however, W. W. Norton decided to reissue the series in its entirety, and so far nine of the 14 have appeared here, including the most recent chapter, &quot;The Nutmeg of Consolation&quot;.

<doc id="621022" wikidata="Q1248019" url="?curid=621022" title="Alice (American TV series)">
<text>Alice is an American sitcom television series that aired on CBS from August 31, 1976, to March 19, 1985. The series is based on director Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 1974 film &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. The show stars Linda Lavin in the title role, a widow who moves with her young son to start life over again, and finds a job working at a roadside diner in Phoenix, Arizona. Most of the episodes revolve around events at Mel&#x27;s Diner, where Alice is employed.

With more than 200 episodes over nine seasons, &quot;Alice&quot; was the longest-running U.S. television sitcom to feature a woman in the starring role until it was surpassed by &quot;Roseanne&quot; in 1996.

== Series summary ==
After her husband Donald is killed in a trucking accident, Alice Spivak Hyatt (Lavin) and her young son Tommy (played by Alfred Lutter in the television pilot, reprising his role from the film, but portrayed by Philip McKeon thereafter) head from their New Jersey home to Los Angeles so Alice can pursue a singing career. Her car breaks down in Phoenix, and viewers meet her soon after she has taken a job as a waitress at Mel&#x27;s Diner. (The later seasons&#x27; exterior shots were of a real diner, named Mel&#x27;s, still in operation in Phoenix.) Alice works alongside Mel Sharples (Vic Tayback), the grouchy, stingy owner and cook of the greasy spoon, and fellow waitresses and friends, sassy, man-hungry Florence Jean &quot;Flo&quot; Castleberry (Polly Holliday), and neurotic, scatterbrained Vera Louise Gorman (Beth Howland).

Most scenes took place inside the diner, or less often Alice&#x27;s one-bedroom apartment in the Desert Sun apartment complex. Vera and Mel&#x27;s studio apartments and Flo&#x27;s trailer were occasionally seen. Two of the diner&#x27;s biggest competitors – Barney&#x27;s Burger Barn and Vinnie&#x27;s House of Veal – were sometimes mentioned.

The diner had regular customers through the years, such as Tommy&#x27;s basketball coach Earl Hicks (Dave Madden), local trucker Chuck (played by Duane R. Campbell), and Henry Beesmeyer (Marvin Kaplan), a telephone repairman who always joked about Mel&#x27;s cooking. Henry&#x27;s oft-mentioned wife Chloe was seen in one episode, played by Ruth Buzzi. Celebrities playing either themselves or other characters (including Martha Raye as Mel&#x27;s free-spirited mother, George Burns, Robert Goulet, Art Carney, Desi Arnaz, Jerry Reed, and Telly Savalas) were a hallmark of the show.

Polly Holliday left the show to star in her own spin-off series, &quot;Flo&quot;. In the episode airing February 24, 1980, Flo leaves to take a hostess job in Houston. On the way to Houston, Flo stops at her hometown, Fort Worth, Texas (which she refers to by its moniker &quot;Cowtown&quot;). Flo decides to buy and run a failing roadhouse bar there, which she renames Flo&#x27;s Yellow Rose. Polly Holliday never made a guest appearance on &quot;Alice&quot; after beginning &quot;Flo&quot;, although flashbacks including Flo were shown in the final episode of &quot;Alice&quot;. Vic Tayback made one guest appearance on &quot;Flo&quot;.

Diane Ladd, who received an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Flo in the film version, joined the cast in 1980 as Isabelle &quot;Belle&quot; Dupree, a hard-edged but kind-hearted woman. She had been a waitress of Mel&#x27;s in the past, during which the two had a romantic relationship. Despite Ladd&#x27;s Golden Globe-winning performance as Belle, the character was not retained for the duration of the series and was replaced early in 1981, the character making one last appearance in which she telephones the diner to inform everyone that she had taken a job as a backup singer in Nashville, Tennessee. No flashbacks of Belle were shown during the series&#x27; finale. Ladd left the $400,000 yearly job, saying it was an amicable and mutual decision, because her character hadn&#x27;t developed the way she had hoped it would.

Theatre actress Celia Weston then joined the cast as the good-natured, boisterous truck driver Jolene Hunnicutt, who came from Myrtle Point, South Carolina. Jolene arrives as she and her male driving partner are in the midst of an argument over his unwelcome advances, during which she throws and breaks many of Mel&#x27;s dishes. Mel agrees to hire her &quot;temporarily&quot; to work off the cost of the dishes, but she stays until the end of the series. Jolene frequently mentions her grandmother, &quot;Granny Gums&quot;, who had only three or four teeth. Jolene also mentions her distant relative Jefferson Davis &quot;Boss&quot; Hogg, a character from the concurrent CBS series &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard.&quot; In one episode Sorrell Booke guest stars as Hogg, along with fellow &quot;Dukes&quot; character Enos (Sonny Shroyer).

The latter years of the show focused on some character development, such as the hasty courtship and marriage of Vera and lovable cop Elliot (Charles Levin). Tommy eventually goes to college and is seen less frequently. In the final season, the character of Alice was absent several times due to Lavin directing a number of episodes and playing the character of Mrs. Walden, Vera&#x27;s wizened, abrasive landlady of arbitrary foreign origin. The final story arc began in the spring of 1985, when country singer Travis Marsh (played by Lavin&#x27;s real-life husband Kip Niven), discovering that he is falling for Alice, &quot;kidnaps&quot; her to take her to Nashville, telling her it is time to follow her dream there. Bewildered at the thought of her dreams finally coming true, Alice agrees, but not without extracting a promise from Travis to drive her back to Phoenix so she can get her affairs in order, including ending her current relationship with a writer.

In the series finale, which aired March 19, 1985, news of several life-changing events is revealed within a matter of minutes, something typical of sitcoms of the era. After nine years of trying, Alice finally gets a recording contract and is moving to Nashville with Travis. Vera announces she is pregnant and decides to be a full-time mother, Elliott having been promoted from officer to detective. Jolene&#x27;s &quot;Granny Gums&quot; dies and leaves her enough money to open her own beauty parlor in her hometown. Besides all three waitresses suddenly leaving simultaneously, by an amazing coincidence Mel has just sold the diner for a large amount of money to a real-estate developer and must close within days. On closing day, he surprisingly gives each waitress a $5,000 farewell bonus. The remainder of the episode shows flashbacks to humorous and significant events, and many of the stars who had appeared on the show, including Polly Holliday. Finally, while cleaning out her locker, Alice finds the &quot;Waitress Wanted&quot; sign that first drew her to the diner. The series&#x27; regular customers, including Henry, Chuck, and Earl, say their emotional farewells, followed by Elliot, and finally the principal characters Tommy, Jolene, Vera, and Alice. The last thing we see is Mel putting up the &quot;Closed&quot; sign and locking up.
==Running gags and catchphrases==
Flo&#x27;s catchphrase, &quot;kiss my grits!&quot; (typically directed at her boss, Mel), enjoyed widespread popularity at the time the character appeared on &quot;Alice&quot;. According to Polly Holliday, the line was originally written as &quot;kiss my honeydew!&quot;, but did not get any laughs. (In the original film, Flo, as played by Diane Ladd, tells Mel in one scene to &quot;Kiss me where the sun don&#x27;t shine.&quot;) Another of Flo&#x27;s catchphrases was &quot;when donkeys fly!&quot; In the years since Polly Holliday&#x27;s portrayal of Flo, Holliday has refused to repeat her famous &quot;grits&quot; line.

In an attempt to duplicate the success of Flo&#x27;s &quot;kiss my grits!&quot;, Belle began using a new put-down: &quot;butter my biscuits!&quot; Belle often used the phrase &quot;my little voice&quot;, who called her &quot;Isabelle&quot;, which she usually used when starting to tell others what she thinks is best.

Mel would snipe &quot;stow it!&quot; at anyone he had qualms with, especially his waitstaff. &quot;Stow it!&quot; was usually followed by either &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;Vera&quot;, &quot;Flo&quot; &quot;Belle&quot;, or &quot;Blondie&quot; (in reference to Jolene). He would also bark &quot;bag it, Blondie!&quot; to Jolene. He eventually gave Vera the nickname &quot;Dingy&quot; and would occasionally bellow &quot;stow it, Dingy&quot; at her. Jolene would sometimes say &quot;when pigs wear perfume.&quot;

In a handful of episodes, Alice put on a double-breasted suit and fedora to assume the character of husky-voiced &quot;Sam Butler&quot;, a mobster she made up as a ruse to fool her intended target. Linda Lavin also played the role of Mrs. Walden in the last season, once even playing both Alice and Mrs. Walden in a split-screen dual role.

Parts of Mel&#x27;s Diner were often destroyed, such as Flo&#x27;s crashing a truck through the front, Mel chopping down a tree which landed on the diner, Mel accidentally having the building targeted for demolition, and the waitresses crashing a hot air balloon through the roof (upon which Jolene cries, &quot;we went to the bad place and it looks just like Mel&#x27;s!&quot;). In one episode, a wrecking ball destroyed the front of the diner because someone could not read Mel&#x27;s handwriting. In another, a group of men literally hoisted up the entire front of the diner with their bare hands.

Mel was a stickler for punctuality. In the fourth season, he installed a time clock, which ended up working to the waitresses&#x27; advantage due to significant overtime (since before then they were forced to clean the storage room on Sundays without extra pay), and he finally smashed it onto the floor. Mel also had a strict rule against moonlighting, often leading to one or more waitresses getting fired, but he always rehired them before the end of each episode.

Although he had a fairly loyal clientele, Mel&#x27;s food and cooking were constantly criticized by his waitresses and customers alike —especially Henry, who always blamed it for his indigestion. However, Mel&#x27;s chili con carne was popular and became a plot point of several episodes. During the first season, a newspaper food critic (played by Victor Buono) dropped dead while eating Mel&#x27;s chili, but it turned out that tainted Peking Duck from a Chinese restaurant was to blame. Art Carney guest-starred in one episode as the spokesman for retail distribution of Mel&#x27;s Chili (&quot;Chili con Carney&quot;) who backed out when he discovered Vera was a distant relative with part ownership in the venture. The popularity of Mel&#x27;s Chili also led to an appearance on Dinah Shore&#x27;s talk show, which led to some bickering among the waitresses because Mel could take only one person along, but everyone ended up going. Mel refused to reveal his &quot;secret ingredient&quot; to Dinah and her TV audience during the cooking demonstration.

== Production information ==
The show&#x27;s theme was called &quot;There&#x27;s a New Girl in Town&quot;, performed by Linda Lavin with music by David Shire and lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Several arrangements of this tune were used throughout the series&#x27; run, including ones that were used only for a few episodes. The lyrics were altered after the second season.

In the opening credits Alice and Tommy pass under overhead road signs that say &quot;Phoenix&quot; and &quot;El Paso&quot;. The only location this occurs in this configuration is at the northern end of Interstate 19 in Tucson.

The Mel&#x27;s Diner set made changes over the years; in the pilot the diner contained a blue refrigerator, but in the series the refrigerator was a dirty stainless steel, then later was changed to clean and shiny stainless steel in 1979–81 and much later the set featured an even shinier stainless steel refrigerator and better appliances. The rest of the set, however, remained the same.

The men&#x27;s and ladies&#x27; restrooms were confined to one room in the pilot and during the first season. From 1977 to 1985, there were separate restrooms with &quot;Ladies&quot; and &quot;Men&quot; written on them.

The storeroom was inside the diner where the men&#x27;s restroom would later be and said &quot;Private&quot; on it during the 1976–77 season. The storeroom from 1977 to 1985 was confined to the back of the diner. Here, the waitresses took their breaks, had their lockers, and stored their uniforms. Mel also conducted his business from this space.

The payphone was a touch tone and was located on the left of the &quot;Restrooms&quot; door in the pilot episode. For the first season, it was moved to the right of the doors that led to the kitchen section of the diner. For the second season, it was moved to the wall between the two doors that became two separate restrooms and was replaced by a phone with a rotary dial. From 1978 to 1985, the phone was a touch tone and was located at a section that was a few steps away from the entrance to the diner.

In the first season, the diner was decorated in an Aztec and cowboy motif to accommodate the feel of Arizona. For the second season, the walls had pink wallpaper with red lines on it. For the third season, the walls had wallpaper with orange leaves on it.

The giant &quot;14-ounce coffee cup&quot; sign used in later seasons was seen by a producer scouting Phoenix for an establishing shot for the show&#x27;s later seasons. It was at &quot;Chris&#x27; Diner&quot; and the owner agreed to change the name to Mel&#x27;s for the show.

The cash register was a Sweda Model 46 and was fully functional for the first few seasons. Later in the series it no longer worked and was shown with the &quot;0&quot; in the cents position off-center due to the register being locked up.

Alice&#x27;s apartment remained more or less unchanged during most of the show&#x27;s run; the apartments of Mel and Vera and Flo&#x27;s trailer were occasionally seen. (The set for Flo&#x27;s trailer was also used on the spinoff &quot;Flo&quot;.)

The pilot episode was taped at CBS Television City in Hollywood, California. After this, the series was taped at The Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California.

Arthur Marx, son of Groucho Marx, co-wrote (with writing partner Robert Fisher and others) 39 episodes of the series, from season two through season six.

===Mel&#x27;s Diner===

Mel&#x27;s Diner is the setting for the 1976−1985 American TV series &quot;Alice&quot;. It is a fictional roadside diner on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona, that serves locals and truckers. It has a counter, two large booths and a couple of tables. Although one of the three waitresses, Alice, is the main character, the show revolves around all of the waitresses and Mel Sharples, the owner and cook. Most scenes of the show take place in the diner as well.

Throughout the run of the series, Mel&#x27;s Diner has a reputation, especially among its regular customers, for serving terrible food, though, more often than not, this is meant to be a joke. Mel&#x27;s is noted for its gourmet chili, which is referred to as &quot;Mel&#x27;s Famous Chili&quot;. In the episode &#x27;Sharples vs Sharples&#x27;, Mel&#x27;s mother, Carrie (Martha Raye), publishes a cookbook with Mel&#x27;s chili recipe in it and the two fight about whose recipe it really is. Carrie takes it out of the book because Mel claims &quot;it&#x27;s mine, mine, mine&quot;.

The outside shot of the diner&#x27;s sign with the giant coffee cup sometimes seen in the opening credits of &quot;Alice&quot; is of a real Mel&#x27;s Diner (1747 NW Grand Avenue) in Phoenix. The sign was seen by a producer scouting Phoenix for an establishing shot. It had been &quot;Chris’ Diner&quot; but the owner agreed to change the name to &quot;Mel&#x27;s&quot; for the show and is called the same to this day.

In the &quot;Mel Spins His Wheels&quot; episode, Alice informs a customer that the diner&#x27;s address is 2128 Bush Highway. However, in a subsequent episode (&quot;Big Bad Mel&quot;), the diner&#x27;s address is given as 1130 Bush Highway. In the &quot;Alice&#x27;s Blind Date&quot; episode, Alice states over the payphone that the address is 1030 Bush Highway when telling her date where to pick her up.

In &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;, the movie on which the series &quot;Alice&quot; is based, the restaurant is called Mel &amp; Ruby&#x27;s Cafe, located in Tucson, Arizona.

== Differences between the film and television series ==
&quot;Alice&quot; had many contrasts with the film on which it was based, &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot;. The tone and style of the series differed greatly from the film, and there were a number of factual differences concerning the characters and setting.

<text>Saint-Jérôme () (2021 population 80,213) is a suburban city located about northwest of Montreal on the Rivière du Nord. It is part of the North Shore sector of Greater Montreal. It is a gateway to the Laurentian Mountains and its resorts via the Autoroute des Laurentides.

The town is named after Saint Jerome (ca. 347 – September 30, 420), a church father best known as the translator of the Bible from Greek and Hebrew into Latin. His translation is known as the Vulgate.

==History==

The territory where the present city of Saint-Jérôme now stands was granted in 1752 by the marquis de la Jonquière, governor of New France, as the seignory of Augmentation des Mille-Iles (literally &quot;enlargement&quot; of the seignory of Mille-Iles). From the 1760s to the 1840s, the seignory was owned by the Dumont and Lefebvre de Bellefeuille families, living in the town of Saint-Eustache, to the south. The Dumont and the Lefebvre conceded the farmland to colonists coming mostly from the region lying north of Montreal. The emerging town was then known under the name of Dumontville. The Catholic parish of Saint-Jérôme was constituted on November 15, 1834, and the village was constituted on July 1, 1845, by governor Metcalfe.

François-Xavier-Antoine Labelle, a Roman Catholic priest who was the great &quot;colonizer&quot; (promoter of settlement) of the North of Montreal, was in charge of the pastoral administration of Saint-Jérôme in 1868 until his death, in 1891. Eight years after his arrival, he had a railway built linking Saint-Jérôme and Montreal.

Antoine Labelle was the parish priest of Saint-Jérôme for 22 years, from 1868 until his death, at 57 years of age, on January 4, 1891. He was called &quot;the king of North, the apostle of colonization&quot;.

The opening of roads and the arrival of a railway became essential with the development of the small communities in the Laurentians. These transportation routes for the movement of goods and people would ensure the establishment of trade and industry.

Labelle promoted the idea of a railway towards the North beginning in 1869. The railway reached Saint-Jérôme in 1876, partly because a railway was seen as a way to meet the needs for firewood and construction materials for urban centres like Montreal and Quebec.

In 2002, Saint-Jérôme was amalgamated with the municipalities of Bellefeuille (2006 census population 15,866), Saint-Antoine (2001 population 11,488) and Lafontaine (2001 population 9,477).

Saint-Jérôme is the seat of the judicial district of Terrebonne.

<text>OOIOO is a Japanese experimental rock band. The four-piece ensemble was founded by Yoshimi P-We (also known as Yoshimio), the drummer and occasional trumpeter for Boredoms. The band&#x27;s origin lies in a photo shoot that Yoshimi was asked to do for a magazine. She invited a few of her friends to join her, and they created a fake band for the shoot, which they later decided to make real. The band quickly gained attention by being the opening act for Sonic Youth in 1997 on their Japan tour.

According to AllMusic&#x27;s Kieran McCarthy &quot;It&#x27;s next to impossible to describe their sound, because — by design — it rarely follows consistent patterns&quot;. Some of their music has been described as having &quot;a majestic ebb and flow that suggests natural wonders&quot; or a &quot;witchy, tribal side&quot;. Either way, at any one time it may incorporate chanting and punchy drums, dancey polyrhythms atonal composition or psychedelia.

<text>Sushmita Sen (; born 19 November 1975) is an Indian actress and beauty pageant titleholder, who was crowned Miss Universe 1994, becoming the first Indian woman to win the title. Sen has since predominantly worked in Hindi films, and is a recipient of a Filmfare Award and a Filmfare OTT Award.

Sen made her acting debut playing a fictionalised version of herself in the thriller &quot;Dastak&quot; (1996). She won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as the girlfriend of a married man in the comedy film &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; (1999), and was also nominated in the category for her roles in the dramas &quot;Sirf Tum&quot; (1999) and &quot;Filhaal...&quot; (2002). Her other commercially successful films were &quot;Aankhen&quot; (2002), &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot; (2004), and &quot;Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?&quot; (2005). After a career downturn and hiatus, Sen starred in the drama series &quot;Aarya&quot; (2020–2024), winning a Filmfare OTT Award, and portrayed transgender activist Shreegauri Sawant in the miniseries &quot;Taali&quot; (2023).

==Early life==
Sen was born on 19 November 1975, into a Bengali Baidya family in Hyderabad to Shubeer Sen, a former Indian Air Force Wing Commander, and Subhra Sen, a jewellery designer and owner of a Dubai-based store. She has a younger brother named Rajeev Sen, who was married to television actress Charu Asopa. 

Sen attended Air Force Golden Jubilee Institute in New Delhi, and St. Ann&#x27;s High School in Secunderabad. She enrolled in a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Political Science in the 2007–08 academic session at School of Open Learning, Delhi University but withdrew her admission later. She did not pursue any further higher education.

==Pageantry==
In 1994, at the age of 18 Sen entered and won the title Femina Miss India, earning the right to compete at the Miss Universe 1994 contest. 
At the Miss Universe contest, Sen ranked third overall in the preliminaries, behind Miss Colombia Carolina Gómez and Miss Venezuela Minorka Mercado. Sen went on to place second, fifth and third in the subsequent rounds and finally won the title and crown of Miss Universe 1994. 

After the Times Group relinquished the rights to choose the Indian representative to Miss Universe, Sen&#x27;s project, I Am She – Miss Universe India, took over, running it for three years (2010–2012). This was followed by Femina taking over.

===Miss Universe judge 2016===
In January 2016, Sen appeared as one of the judges of Miss Universe 2016 at the Mall of Asia Arena, Pasay, Metro Manila, Philippines. Joining her as judges were Cynthia Bailey, Mickey Boardman, Francine LaFrak, Miss Universe 2011 Leila Lopes, and Miss Universe 1993 Dayanara Torres.

==Acting career==

===Debut and breakthrough (1996–2000)===
After her reign as Miss Universe, Sen ventured into the Hindi film industry. Her first film was in 1996, the thriller &quot;Dastak&quot;, in which she played the victim of a stalker, played by Sharad Kapoor. She then starred in the 1997 Tamil action film &quot;Ratchagan&quot;, opposite Nagarjuna. It was the most expensive Indian film at the time of its release. In 1998, she played a low-profile reporter opposite Sunny Deol in &quot;Zor&quot;, a box office failure.

In 1999, Sen earned wider recognition with her portrayal of Rupali Walia in David Dhawan&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Biwi No.1&quot;, alongside Salman Khan and Karisma Kapoor. It received positive reviews from critics and emerged as the second highest-grossing movie of 1999. Syed Firdaus Ashraf of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; noted, &quot;Sen has tried hard to make a mark in a different role, but her role itself isn&#x27;t worth remembering.&quot; She won the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film. The same year, she received a second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance as Aarti in the romantic drama &quot;Sirf Tum&quot;. For this performance, Sharmila Taliculam of Rediff.com termed her the, &quot;star of the film&quot;. Her last film of the year was &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; opposite Ajay Devgn. The film was an average grosser, despite taking a bumper opening. 

Her only film in 2000, &quot;Aaghaaz&quot; saw her playing a police officer, opposite Suniel Shetty. Anjali Abrol of PlanetBollywood.com stated that Sen did &quot;decently well&quot; in her role.

===Career progression (2001–2005)===
In 2001, she first appeared opposite Govinda in the fantasy comedy &quot;Kyo Kii... Main Jhuth Nahin Bolta&quot;. Her second film of the year, &quot;Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai&quot;, was a disaster at the box office.

Sen received critical acclaim for her roles in 2002. Her first film of the year &quot;Aankhen&quot; saw her play a teacher, opposite Arjun Rampal and Akshay Kumar, was a critical success and the second-highest-grossing film of 2002. Priya Ganapati of &quot;Rediff.com&quot; noted, &quot;Sushmita Sen&#x27;s role of Neha deserves an extra round of applause. Neha doesn&#x27;t need a man to exist. She is intelligent and capable, even during the climax.&quot; She next appeared in the action thriller &quot;Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge&quot; opposite Salman Khan. In her final film of the year, Sen portrayed a surrogate mother in the romantic film &quot;Filhaal...&quot;, opposite Palash Sen. Radhika Rajamani of &quot;Idlebrain&quot; opined, &quot;The sterling performance (best up to date) of Sushmita Sen endears.&quot; &quot;BBC&quot; noted, &quot;Sushmita Sen, is the sparkling character of the film. She adds the lighter moments with sheer panache. In my books, she is a real gem!&quot; Her performance in the film earned her a third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Sen played a widowed cop in her only film of 2003, the acclaimed thriller film, &quot;&quot;. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; noted, &quot;Sushmita Sen, cast in a challenging role, does full justice to her part.&quot;

Sen had three films in 2004. She first appeared in &quot;Vaastu Shastra&quot;, as a doctor opposite J. D. Chakravarthi. Her career&#x27;s biggest success came with the action masala film &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot;, in which she played the role of a chemistry teacher opposite Shah Rukh Khan. The film grossed a total of 330,000,000 and was the second highest-grossing film of that year. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; noted, &quot;Sushmita Sen looks like a million bucks and her on-screen chemistry with SRK is fantastic. Her role doesn&#x27;t really demand histrionics, but she carries it off stylishly.&quot; In her last film of the year, she appeared alongside Manisha Koirala in &quot;Paisa Vasool&quot;.

Sen received further success with her two films of 2005. She first portrayed a dutiful nurse in her third film with Salman Khan, the romantic comedy &quot;Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya?&quot;. It emerged as the fifth-highest-grossing film of the year. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com stated, &quot;Sen as Naina looks hot, talks sense and acts super. Her intelligence doesn&#x27;t interfere with the absurdity of her surroundings. It only makes it more convincing.&quot; Later the year, she portrayed a lawyer in &quot;Main Aisa Hi Hoon&quot; opposite Ajay Devgan. &quot;BBC&quot; said that Sen &quot;shines&quot; in her performances as innocent client and well-meaning lawyer.

===Career fluctuations (2006–2011)===
Sen had two releases in 2006. She first played a prostitute with a child in &quot;Chingaari&quot; opposite Anuj Sawhney. Priyanka Jain of Rediff.com noted, &quot;Sushmita puts in a mind-blowing performance. It&#x27;s her film through and through. She is the only possible reason to watch this film.&quot; She then played a rockstar Kriya in the musical film &quot;Zindaggi Rocks&quot;, opposite Shiney Ahuja. 

In 2007, she played a widow in the action drama film &quot;Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag&quot;, opposite Prashant Raj Sachdev. It is considered as one of the worst films ever made. In 2009, Sen first appeared in the critical failure drama film &quot;Karma Aur Holi&quot; opposite Randeep Hooda. She then appeared opposite Govinda in the comedy film &quot;Do Knot Disturb&quot;. 

Sen had two releases in 2010. She first appeared as a successful supermodel in the romantic comedy &quot;Dulha Mil Gaya&quot;, opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Fardeen Khan. The film was a moderate success that year. Sen then appeared in the action-comedy film &quot;No Problem&quot;, the same year.

===Hiatus and expansion (2015–present)===

Sen did not have any releases for five years. In 2015, she starred in a Bengali drama film titled &quot;Nirbaak&quot;, marking her comeback opposite Anjan Dutt. In Sen&#x27;s career, this was her first film in Bengali language. Shomini Sen of &quot;News18&quot; wrote, &quot;Sushmita Sen is good but there is so much more that could be done to tap from her talent.&quot;

Post a hiatus of five years, Sen made her web debut in 2020 with Disney+ Hotstar&#x27;s crime thriller &quot;Aarya&quot;. She played a mafia queen opposite Chandrachur Singh. Udita Jhunjhunwala of &quot;Firstpost&quot; noted, &quot;Sen holds the series together. As the unsuspecting inheritor of a shady consignment, she literally and figuratively towers over everyone else. This meaty role allows her space to express herself.&quot; Sen received the award for Best Actress – Female, at the 2020 Filmfare OTT Awards. Sen then reprised her role in the second season of the series in 2022. Saibal Chatterjee of &quot;NDTV&quot; noted, &quot;Sushmita Sen carries on from where she left off in Season 1. With nary a false step, she delivers another exceptional performance packed with power.&quot;

==Personal life==
Sen is the mother of two adopted daughters. At the age of 24 years old she adopted her first daughter Renee Sen in 2000 while her second daughter Alisah joined the family in 2010. 

=== Health ===

Sen was diagnosed in 2014 with Addison&#x27;s disease and was told she would require lifelong steroid drugs to manage the illness. After being rushed to hospital in 2019, doctors confirmed Sen no longer had to take steroids. &quot;I healed in time, my adrenal glands woke up, no more steroids, no withdrawals and no auto-immune condition as of 2019,&quot; Sen stated.

=== Relationships ===

Sen was in a relationship with actor Randeep Hooda from 2004 to 2006. Sen then dated model Rohman Shawl from 2018 to 2021. In July 2022, it was reported that she is dating businessman and cricket administrator Lalit Modi.

<text>Yoshimi (born on February 18, 1968) is a Japanese musician best known for her role as the longest consistent drummer in the Japanese rock band Boredoms.

Alongside her drum playing skills with Boredoms, she performs the vocals for the all female group OOIOO and also plays trumpet, guitar and keyboards as well.

Born in Okayama, Japan, Yoshimi joined her first band, U.F.O. or Die, with EYE in 1986. Since 1997, she has led the all-female band OOIOO and continues to contribute to the current incarnation of Boredoms.

Yoshimi has worked on many other projects, most notably a raga band called Saicobab, an ambient project called &quot;Yoshimi and Yuka&quot;, the tribal-drum-influenced OLAibi, and indie supergroup Free Kitten. She appeared as a session player and vocalist on the Flaming Lips&#x27; 2002 album &quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots&quot;. Yoshimi participated as drummer one in the Boredoms 77 Boadrum performance, which occurred on July 7, 2007, at the Empire-Fulton Ferry State Park in Brooklyn, New York.

==Reception==
Yoshimi was featured on the cover of the July 2014 issue of WIRE magazine, and in a feature article by James Hadfield. Pitchfork covered her and her band OOIOO in a feature article in 2020. Modern Drummer magazine carried a feature article on Yoshimi written by John Colpitts. In 2016, Emi Kariya interviewed Yoshimi and Ikue Mori for Tom Tom Magazine.

Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips said that their album &quot;Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots&quot; was inspired by Yoshimi. He called her &quot;one of those strange genius musicians.&quot;

<text>The Fiat Multipla (Type 186) is a six-seater car produced by Italian automaker Fiat from 1998 to 2010. Based on the Bravo/Brava, the Multipla was shorter and wider than its rivals. It had two rows of three seats, where its compact MPV competitors had two across front seating. The Multipla is shorter than the three-door Bravo/Brava on which it was based, yet it offered increased seating and cargo volume. Sales commenced in Italy in November 1998.

In common with a number of other modern Fiats, the Multipla reused the name of an earlier vehicle, in this case the &quot;Multipla&quot; variant of the Fiat 600 produced during the 1950s and 1960s.

The Multipla was assembled and marketed in China from 2008 to 2013 under license by Zotye Auto as the Zotye M300 Langyue, using knock-down kits from Italy. Zotye also sold a total of 220 all-electric versions of the M300.

==Design==

A first Multipla concept car was unveiled in at the Paris Motor Show in October 1996. The final production car was presented at the International Motor Show Germany in Frankfurt in the Autumn of 1997.

The exterior and interior design of the Multipla were displayed at the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) in New York during its &quot;Different Roads – Automobiles for the Next Century&quot; exhibition in 1999.

It won the &quot;Top Gear&quot; &quot;Car of the Year&quot; (2000), as well as the &quot;More beautiful Car in the world&quot; in the same programme&#x27;s awards. It was also voted &quot;Top Gear Magazine&quot; &quot;Family Car of the Year&quot; for four years in a row, from 2001 to 2004. In July 2000, in the series finale of &quot;Clarkson&#x27;s Car Years&quot;, it was awarded &quot;Family Car of the Moment&quot;.

Multipla sales began in Italy in November 1998, with most other markets receiving it a year later. The Multipla sold well with Italian buyers, but sales elsewhere were less successful.

The Multipla underwent a major facelift in March 2004, in an attempt to shed its original styling for a more restrained look. This was with the intention of attracting more buyers, but failed to garner critical acclaim. Upon the subsequent restyling, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported designers were &quot;desperately sad that the new Multipla no longer resembles a psychotic cartoon duck,&quot; and &quot;while passengers loved the adaptability of the clever interior, they were less keen on the sarcastic sneers and derisive laughter of their neighbours, friends and schoolmates; children can be cruel.&quot;

&quot;The Telegraph&quot; placed it #2 on its list of the &quot;100 Ugliest Cars&quot; in August 2008, saying, &quot;Derided for the blandness of its output during the 1980s and early 1990s, Fiat dared to start thinking outside the box. In this case, however, it simply added wheels to the box.&quot; The Multipla was also named the ugliest car of all time by readers of &quot;Car Throttle&quot; in January 2014. In February 2018, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; named it on a list of ugliest cars, saying, &quot;The tragedy of the Multipla is that its Elephant Man-esque exterior enclosed a genuinely clever and spacious interior, and it wasn&#x27;t bad to drive, either. It&#x27;s a shame, then, that you&#x27;d rather walk than be seen in it.&quot;
==Engines==
A 1.6 L engine, which could be powered on either methane or standard petrol, was offered in certain markets.
==Trim levels==
===United Kingdom===
* Multipla SX: basic model available with petrol or diesel engines.
* Multipla ELX: added Air Conditioning, Twin Electric Sunroofs, alloy wheels and electric rear windows, as well as special wipe clean, brightly coloured seats.

In June 2004, when the Multipla received its facelift, these trim levels were later replaced with &quot;Dynamic&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Family&quot;, &quot;Dynamic Plus&quot;.

==Practicality==
The new generation Multipla was praised by journalists at its launch for its flexibility. The Multipla&#x27;s three abreast seating configuration allows for adjustment of the front seats, and the removal and relocation of the rear seats into many formats. It also affords a big of luggage space, which can increase to of flat floor load space, with the rear three seats removed from the vehicle.
==Zotye M300==
From December 2008 to September 2010, Zotye Auto had assembled Multipla 2 from KD kits, in its factory in Changshan, and marketed it in China as the Zotye Multiplan. In October 2010, Zotye started to build a version of Multipla 2, employing more locally made parts in order to reduce costs; the new version is called &quot;Langyue&quot; in China. There are 2 types: M300 (Engine powered) and M300 EV (see below) which is electric.

<text>Carom billiards, also called French billiards and sometimes carambole billiards, is the overarching title of a family of cue sports generally played on cloth-covered, billiard tables. In its simplest form, the object of the game is to score or &quot;counts&quot; by &quot;&quot; one&#x27;s own off both the opponent&#x27;s cue ball and the on a single shot. The invention as well as the exact date of origin of carom billiards is somewhat obscure but is thought to be traceable to 18th-century France.

There is a large array of carom billiards disciplines. Some of the more prevalent today and historically are (chronologically by apparent date of development): straight rail, one-cushion, balkline, three-cushion and artistic billiards.

Carom billiards is popular in Europe, particularly France, where it originated. It is also popular in Asian countries, including Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, and Vietnam, but is now considered obscure in North America, having been supplanted by pool in popularity. The Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB) is the highest international governing body of competitive carom billiards.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;carom&quot;, which simply means any strike and rebound, was in use in reference to billiards by at least 1779, sometimes spelled &quot;carrom&quot;. Sources differ on the origin. It has been pegged variously as a shortening of the Spanish and Portuguese word &quot;carambola&quot;, or the French word &quot;carambole&quot;, which are used to describe the red object ball. Some etymologists have suggested that &quot;carambola&quot;, in turn, was derived from a yellow-to-orange, tropical Asian fruit also known in Portuguese as a &quot;carambola&quot; (which was a corruption of the original name of the fruit, &quot;karambal&quot; in the Marathi language of India), also known as star fruit. But this may simply be folk etymology, as the fruit bears no resemblance to a billiard ball, and there is no direct evidence for such a derivation.

In modern French, the word &quot;&quot; means &#x27;successive collision&#x27;, currently used mainly in reference to or shots in billiards, and to multiple-vehicle car crashes.

==Equipment==

===Table===
The billiard table used for carom billiards is a pocketless version and is typically .

Most cloth made for carom billiard tables is a type of baize that is typically dyed green and is made from 100% worsted wool with no nap, which provides a very fast surface allowing the balls to travel with little resistance across the table .

The slate bed of a carom billiard table is often heated to about 5 °C (9 °F) above room temperature, which helps to keep moisture out of the cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster. An electrically heated table is required under international tournament rules &#x27;in order to ensure the best possible rolling&#x27;, although temperatures are not specified. It is an especially important requirement for the games of three-cushion billiards and artistic billiards, and even local billiard halls often have this feature in countries where carom games are popular. Queen Victoria (1819–1901) had a billiard table that was heated using zinc tubes, although the aim at that time was chiefly to keep the then-used ivory balls from warping. The first use of electric heating was for an 18.2 balkline tournament held in December 1927 between Welker Cochran and Jacob Schaefer Jr. &quot;The New York Times&quot; announced it with fanfare: &quot;For the first time in the history of world&#x27;s championship balkline billiards a heated table will be used ...&quot;

===Balls===

In most carom billiards games, the set of three standard balls includes a white cue ball, a second cue ball in yellow, and a third object ball in red. Historically, the second cue ball was white with red or black spots to differentiate it; both types of ball sets are permitted in tournament play. The balls are significantly larger and heavier than their pool or snooker counterparts, with a diameter of , and a weight ranging between with a typical weight of .

Billiard balls have been made from many different materials throughout the history of the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including early formulations of celluloid, Bakelite, and crystalate, and more modern phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic), and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The quest for an alternative to ivory was primarily driven by economic considerations and concerns for the safety of elephant hunters, rather than environmental or animal-welfare issues. The impetus for this search was, in part, the announcement by New York billiard table manufacturer Brunswick-Balke-Collender offering a $10,000 prize for the development of a substitute material. The initial successful alternative came in the form of celluloid, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868. However, while celluloid was a viable substitute, it proved to be volatile and highly flammable, with instances of explosions occurring during its manufacturing process.

===Cues===
Carom billiard cues have specialized refinements making them different from cues used in other cue sports. Carom cues tend to be shorter and lighter overall, with a shorter , a thicker and , a wooden joint (in high-end examples), and wood-to-wood joint. They have a sharply conical , and a smaller diameter as compared with pool cues. Typical carom cues are in length and in weight – lighter for straight rail, heavier for three-cushion – with a tip in diameter. These dimensions make the cue significantly stiffer, which aids in handling the larger and heavier balls used in carom billiards. It also acts to reduce (sometimes called &quot;squirt&quot;), which is displacement of the cue ball&#x27;s path away from the parallel line formed by the cue stick&#x27;s direction of travel. It is a factor that occurs every time is employed, and its effects are magnified by speed. In some carom games, deflection plays a large role because many shots require extremes of side-spin, coupled with great speed; this is a combination typically minimized as much as possible, by contrast, in pool.

==History of games==

===Straight rail===

Straight rail is thought to date to the 18th century, although no exact time of origin is known. The object of straight rail is simple: one point, called a &quot;count&quot;, is scored each time a player&#x27;s cue ball makes contact with both object balls (the second cue ball and the third ball) on a single . A win is achieved by reaching an agreed upon number of counts.

At straight rail&#x27;s inception there was no restriction on the manner of scoring. However, the technique of &quot;crotching&quot;, or freezing two balls into the corner where the rails meet—the &quot;crotch&quot;—vastly increasing counts, resulted in an 1862 rule which allowed only three counts before at least one ball had to be driven away. Techniques continued to develop which increased counts greatly despite the crotching prohibition, especially the development of a variety of &quot; techniques. The most important of these, the &quot;, involves the progressive nudging of the object balls down a rail, ideally moving them only a small amount on each count, keeping them close together and positioned at the end of each stroke in the same or near the same configuration such that the nurse can be replicated again and again.

Straight rail is still popular in Europe, where it is considered a fine practice game for both balkline and three-cushion billiards. Additionally, Europe hosts professional competitions known as &quot;pentathlons&quot; in which straight rail is featured as one of five billiards disciplines at which players compete, the other four being 47.1 balkline, cushion caroms, 71.2 balkline, and three-cushion billiards.

Straight rail was played professionally in the United States from 1873 to 1879, but is uncommon there today.

===Balkline===
In 1879, a variant called the &quot;champion&#x27;s game&quot; or &quot;limited-rail&quot; was introduced with the specific intent of frustrating the rail nurse. The game employed diagonal lines at the table&#x27;s corners to regions where counts were restricted. Ultimately, however, despite its divergence from straight rail, the champion&#x27;s game simply expanded the dimensions of the balk space defined under the existing crotch prohibition which was not sufficient to stop nursing.
Balkline succeeded the champion&#x27;s game, adding more rules to curb nursing techniques. In the balkline games, the entire table is divided into rectangular balk spaces, by drawing pairs of balklines lengthwise and widthwise across the table parallel from each rail. This divides the table into nine rectangular balkspaces. Such balk spaces define areas of the in which a player may only score up to a threshold number of points while the are within that region. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called &quot;anchor spaces&quot;, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.

For the most part, the differences between one balkline game to another is defined by two measures: the spacing of the balklines and the number of points that are allowed in each balk space before at least one ball must leave the region. Generally, balkline games and their particular restrictions are given numerical names indicating both of these characteristics; the first number indicated either inches or centimeters depending on the game, and the second, after a dot or a slash, indicates the count restriction in balk spaces, which is always either one or two. For example, in &quot;18.2 balkline&quot;, one of the more prominent balkline games and of US origin, the name indicates that balklines are drawn distant from each rail, and only two counts are allowed in a balk space before a ball must leave. By contrast, in &quot;71.2 balkline&quot;, of French invention, lines are drawn distant from each rail, also with a two-count restriction for balk spaces.

In its various incarnations, balkline was the predominant carom discipline from 1883 to the 1930s, when it was overtaken by three-cushion billiards and pool. Balkline is still popular in Europe and the Far East.

===One-cushion===
One-cushion carom, or simply cushion carom, also arose in the late 1860s as another alternative to the repetitive play of straight rail, inspired by an early variant of English billiards. The object of the game is to score cushion caroms, meaning a carom off of both object balls with at least one rail cushion being struck before the hit on the second object ball. One-cushion carom is still popular in Europe.

===Three-cushion===

In three-cushion carom, the object is to carom off both object balls with at least three being contacted before the contact of the cue ball with the second object ball.

Three-cushion is a very difficult game. Averaging one point per is professional-level play, and averaging 1.5 to 2 is world-class play.

Wayman C. McCreery of St. Louis, Missouri, is credited with popularizing the game in the 1870s. At least one publication categorically states he invented the game as well. The first three-cushion billiards tournament took place 14–31 January 1878, in St. Louis, with McCreery a participant and Leon Magnus the winner. The high run for the tournament was just 6 points, and the high average a 0.75. The game was infrequently played, with many top carom players of the era voicing their dislike of it, until the 1907 introduction of the Lambert Trophy. By 1924, three-cushion had become so popular that two giants in other billiard disciplines agreed to take up the game especially for a challenge match. On 22 September 1924, Willie Hoppe, the world&#x27;s balkline champion (who later took up three-cushion with a passion), and Ralph Greenleaf, the world&#x27;s straight pool title holder, played a well advertised, multi-day, to 600 . Hoppe was the eventual winner with a final score in of 600–527.

Three-cushion billiards retains great popularity in parts of Europe, Asia, and Latin America, and is the most popular carom billiards game played in the US today. UMB, as the governing body of the sport, had been staging world three-cushion championships since the late 1920s.

===Artistic billiards===
In artistic billiards players compete at performing 76 preset shots of varying difficulty. Each set shot has a maximum point value assigned for perfect execution, ranging from a 4-point minimum for lowest level difficulty shots, and climbing to an 11-point maximum for shots deemed highest in difficulty level. There is a total of 500 points available to a player.

Each shot in an artistic billiards match is played from a well-defined position (in some venues within an exacting two millimeter tolerance), and each shot must unfold in an established manner. Players are allowed three attempts at each shot. In general, the shots making up the game, even 4-point shots, require a high degree of skill, devoted practice and specialized knowledge to perform.

World title competition first started in 1986 and required the use of ivory balls. However, this requirement was dropped in 1990. The highest score ever achieved in competition overall is 427 set by Walter Bax on 12 March 2006, at a competition held in Deurne, Belgium, beating his own previous record of 425. The game is played predominantly in western Europe, especially in France, Belgium and the Netherlands.

<doc id="621040" wikidata="Q4959186" url="?curid=621040" title="Bread bowl">
<text>A bread bowl is a round loaf of bread which has had the top cut off and a large portion of the middle hollowed out to create an edible bowl. They are typically larger than a roll but smaller than a full sized loaf of bread. 

Bread bowls can be used to serve chili, New England–style clam chowder, and other thick soups and stews (often, but not always, with a cheese or cream base). Soups with thinner bases are not generally served in bread bowls, as the broth would make the bread get too soggy too quickly. The bread becomes flavored as it absorbs some of the stew&#x27;s base, and can be eaten after the stew has been eaten. Bread bowls are also used for dips, using the scooped-out bread for dipping.

==Variations==

Spinach dip made with dehydrated vegetable soup mix is often served in a round pumpernickel bread loaf.

===Coffin lid===

&quot;Coffin lid&quot; or &quot;coffin bread&quot; () is a Taiwanese variant developed in Tainan. It uses Texas toast preferably those cut from the soft loaves popular in East Asia deep frying the bread to a crisp. A layer of crust is then cut away to expose the inside, which is then dug out, allowing stews to be placed in. The crust layer is then replaced on top of the stew.

<doc id="621041" wikidata="Q328378" url="?curid=621041" title="Ed Templeton">
<text>Ed Templeton (born July 28, 1972) is an American professional skateboarder, contemporary artist, and photographer. He is the founder of the skateboard company, Toy Machine, a company that he continues to own and manage. He is based in Huntington Beach, California.

Templeton was inducted into the Skateboard Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life==
Templeton was born in Garden Grove, Orange County, California, USA. His family lived in various places in Southern California before moving to Huntington Beach. He began skateboarding in 1985 in Huntington Beach, with friend, Jason Lee. In a 2012 interview, Templeton explained the commencement of his fascination with skateboarding:
The first thing that I ever saw was a kid skating down the street and he ollied up a curb; that was, you know, the thing that got me started. I thought that was the coolest thing ever, like, how could this guy just keep cruising down the street and not have to stop and pick up his board. By luck, [professional skateboarder and company owner] Mark Gonzales lived here in 1987, so, ah, one of my first, probably the first pro I ever saw, or realized was a pro skateboarder, was Mark Gonzales. I was in Sidewalk Surfer, the skate shop down here, and, that was on Main St., in Huntington Beach; we went in there to look at stickers, and there was a Skull Skates sticker which I fell in love with—I thought that was the coolest sticker ever ... so we followed him [Gonzales], ahh, back to his house, like stalkers, and, uh, and started skating the quarter-pipe [ramp] and he had disappeared, but then he came back down, did, like, a three, four-foot high &quot;judo air&quot; ... I remember being pretty floored, floored by that.

Templeton married his wife, Deanna Templeton, in 1991. They both became vegetarian in 1990, vegan in 1991 and have not consumed meat or dairy products since.

Templeton has avoided alcohol for most of his life and does not smoke or use other recreational drugs.

==Professional skateboarding==
Templeton became a professional skateboarder a month before graduating from high school signing with New Deal Skateboards in 1990. He left New Deal in 1992 to initiate two short-lived companies, &quot;TV&quot; and &quot;Television&quot; (both with professional skateboarder, Mike Vallely).

===Toy Machine===
Following the demise of both TV and television, Templeton founded Toy Machine in 1994, after skateboarding entrepreneur Tod Swank agreed to support the idea. As of January 2013, Toy Machine is distributed by Swank&#x27;s Tum Yeto company—Tum Yeto also distributes the Dekline skate shoe brand, the Pig skate wheel brand, the Ruckus skate truck brand, and the Foundation skateboard deck brand.

Templeton, who does all of the artwork for his brand, explained his discovery of skateboard art in a 2012 interview:
It wasn&#x27;t until later that I realized he [Gonzales] did his own graphics. And that&#x27;s, that&#x27;s the one thing that I would cite as one of my biggest influences, was learning about the pros that did their own skateboard graphics—that to me was a really ... cool idea, and kind of meant a lot to me as a kid, &#x27;cause I thought ... the board I am potentially buying ... was made by the guy whose name&#x27;s on that board. He put his own artistic touch, or, or, his effort into that board. It wasn&#x27;t just some hired artist.

In a January 2013 article, by Andrew Reilly for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, the ethos behind Toy Machine (or, the company&#x27;s full name: &quot;Toy Machine Bloodsucking Skateboard Co.&quot;), is described as, &quot;an adverse reaction to the misrepresented and highly corporate images of skateboarding in popular culture&quot;, with Templeton referring to fans of the brand as &quot;loyal pawns&quot;. The company&#x27;s popularity increased following inception, and tours—both domestic and international—followed. As of January 2013, the company has released a total of eleven videos (including tour and promotional videos), and sponsors a team of eleven skateboarders, including Leo Romero, &quot;Thrasher&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Skater of the Year&quot; in 2010.

While running Toy Machine in the mid-1990s, Templeton joined a now-defunct skate shoe brand named Sheep. While sponsored by the company, Templeton released his first signature model shoe that was non-leather and entirely vegan. Other riders on the team were Rick McCrank, Brian Anderson, Mike Manzoori (now a skateboard videographer), and Frank Hirata. Templeton was featured in the Sheep video, &quot;Life of Leisure&quot;, released in 1996.

After the Sheep brand ended around the end of the twentieth century, Templeton became sponsored by the Emerica shoe company, a brand that was launched by Sole Technology, also responsible for the etnies and eS brands (as of January 2013, the latter is on a protracted hiatus). Templeton joined other professional skateboarders, such as Andrew Reynolds, Aaron Suski, Chris Senn, and Erik Ellington, in the making of the company&#x27;s second video &quot;This Is Skateboarding&quot;, released in 2002; Templeton&#x27;s part is edited to a song by Butter 08, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s the Rage&quot;.

In November 2012, Templeton suffered a leg injury while participating in an Emerica demo that had the potential to end his career. Templeton used the time to prepare a photographic exhibition, later entitled &quot;Memory Foam&quot;, that was opened in January 2013.

In 2012, along with numerous other team riders from the RVCA clothing brand, Templeton left RVCA and joined a newly started clothing brand named &quot;eswic&quot;.

===Influence===
Templeton identified the following five skateboarders as his top five all-time influences: Gonzales, Rodney Mullen, Tony Hawk, Tony Alva, and Heath Kirchart. In relation to skateboarding more generally, Templeton stated:
The same idea that got me interested in skating is still relevant today; through all the changes and years and whatever, I&#x27;ve always maintained that the only thing that is lame about skateboarding is the skateboarding industry. We can look at all the industry changes, and the trends, and the videos, and X Games, and whatever, and think, start thinking, &quot;Oh, skateboarding&#x27;s different&quot;; but that&#x27;s not skateboarding at all. Skateboarding is still simply skateboarding.

Templeton was identified by &quot;Transworld Skateboarding&quot; magazine as the twentieth most influential skater of all time. Following his selection, Templeton explained his position in skateboarding in relation to Toy Machine:
There’s a good chance that I wouldn’t have been part of it this long if I didn’t have Toy Machine and so for that I’m really thankful. All I can take care of is my little corner of skateboarding and try and make it legitimate and respectable and cool and keep it true to the people that skateboard and keep it true to the thing I love.

Templeton also identified his teenage skateboarding area, Huntington Beach, as an influence on the progression of street-based skateboarding, stating, &quot;I can say that for certain, that there was, something happened here ... in Huntington Beach, that advanced street skating. I can say that without tooting my own horn ...&quot;

===Videography===
==Contemporary artist==
Outside of skateboarding, Templeton is a painter, graphic designer, and photographer, areas that he has gained a reputation without any formal training—the &quot;Photography Colleges&quot; website, in an article entitled &quot;New School Photography: Ed Templeton&quot;, identifies Templeton as &quot;probably the most influential contemporary photographer&quot;. Templeton&#x27;s signature model skateboards for the New Deal company were self-designed and he subsequently became the head designer for his own brands—Templeton produces all of the art work for the Toy Machine skateboard company that, as of January 2013, is his primary skateboarding project. Templeton is also a co-editor of &quot;ANP Quarterly&quot;, an arts magazine started in 2005.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, Templeton clarified that his first art show was in 1993 and that he has &quot;been skating, going on tours, painting in the studio and doing a show and sometimes a mixture of both. Sometimes going on a tour and then leaving for a few days to go to my show&quot;, describing it as &quot;chaos in a lot of ways.&quot; In the same article, Templeton is counterposed to the &quot;wholesome&quot; depiction of Tony Hawk and the &quot;sporting good stores&quot;; instead, Templeton is associated with &quot;teenage misfits&quot;. Templeton&#x27;s painted works (and a single photograph) are featured on his Tumblr profile—maintained by the artist himself—&quot;The Cul-de-sac of Lameness&quot;.

In 2000, Templeton&#x27;s book of photography, &quot;Teenage Smokers&quot;, won the Italian Search For Art competition and Templeton was awarded US$50,000. In both 2001 and 2011, Templeton&#x27;s artwork was featured in &quot;Juxtapoz&quot; magazine and, in 2002, the art exhibition, &quot;The Essential Disturbance&quot;, was held at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris, France, a show that was accompanied by a 100-page book, &quot;The Golden Age of Neglect,&quot; published by Drago ().

Templeton is a featured artist in &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot;, a project that consisted of several elements: a touring art exhibit, a collected art book and a feature documentary film, all of which include the work of various contemporary artists. A large section of the art in the Beautiful Losers project covers skateboarding and other urban themes. In 2003, Templeton, along with members of the Toy Machine team, skated on a variety of purpose-built structures—including a car—at the base of the Cincinnati Contemporary Art Center for the temporary showcase of Beautiful Losers. Templeton&#x27;s work and career are also subjects in the &quot;Beautiful Losers&quot; film.

In 2008, Templeton published &quot;Deformer&quot;—the culmination of eleven years of preparation and research, in which he explores the &quot;incubator of suburban outskirts&quot;, Orange County, California; that is, the area in which he spent his formative years. A documentary film, entitled &quot;Deformer&quot;, was also produced and released, featuring Templeton and the directorial work of Mike Mills; Mills also collaborated with Templeton for the Beautiful Losers project.

In early 2011, Templeton released a book featuring a collection of photographs, entitled &quot;Teenage Kissers&quot;. In October 2011, Templeton explained the origin of the project:
Unlike many photo projects, the concept was an afterthought. It’s typical for a photographer to come up with an idea or concept and then go out and shoot it. But in this case I have always shot people kissing whenever I had the chance. When curator/writer Arty Nelson called me and suggested we do a show of Teenage Kissers at the Half Gallery in NYC, he was thinking of my first book Teenage Smokers (1999). I did a quick search of my archive and realized I had more than enough to do a show. So Teenage Kissers was conceived as a sister book to Teenage Smokers. It’s the exact same size and has a very similar cover.

The Australian publication, &quot;Curvy&quot;, which focuses on the work of female artists, identified the collection as a favourite, in specific relation to Templeton&#x27;s oeuvre, and &quot;Curvy&quot; contributor, Katie O, described the photographic series in the following manner: &quot;It’s equal parts cute and gross. It’s a perfect depiction of teen romance – curiosity, infatuation, desperation to grow up, and getting in over your head. The photos are awkward and wonderful and will remind you how tricky being an adolescent was – and how glad you are it’s over.&quot;

On January 12, 2013, Templeton held an opening event for a photographic exhibition, entitled &quot;Memory Foam&quot;, at the Roberts &amp; Tilton gallery (now Roberts Projects). Consisting of sixty-eight photographs, the show features Templeton&#x27;s impressions of the people of Huntington Beach, California, US and ended on February 16, 2013. Actor, Neil Patrick Harris, who is reportedly an admirer of Templeton&#x27;s photographic work, attended the event and clothing brand, eswic, published a video segment that was filmed at the opening.

Lucy Moore, former friend of the late London bookstore owner Claire de Rouen, selected Templeton&#x27;s book &quot;Litmus Test&quot; (Super Labo) for a tribute to de Rouen that was featured by the &quot;Modern Matter&quot; magazine in March 2013. In regard to Templeton&#x27;s photographic exploration of Russia, Moore explains: &quot;Like litmus paper turning irreversibly red after it has been soaked in lemon juice, the photographs document the way that first impressions leave indelible marks upon our memory, shaping what follows.&quot; Moore also writes that Templeton&#x27;s skateboarding may be responsible for the collection&#x27;s &quot;feeling of equivalence between photographer and subject.&quot;

Templeton explained in an April 2013 interview that the Leica M6 camera (with 50 mm lens) is the camera that he primarily uses for his photographic work, but that he also likes to use the Fuji GF670. Templeton also stated that film is his preferred photographic medium and that he only uses digital photography for Instagram images. The same interview also revealed that Templeton looks for &quot;anything that illustrates the human existence&quot; when shooting photographs.

===Artistic and photographic influences===
Templeton revealed his art influences in a 2012 interview for the &quot;FVF&quot; publication:
Peter Beard is one person that’s a photographer but also a diarist. He spent a lot of time painting on photographs. That’s been super influential. But there have been a lot of people that have painted on photographs that I have enjoyed through the years. Robert Frank is someone who’s like kind of standard in a way. But I think everyone focuses on the work from &quot;The Americans&quot; but there’s this whole other body after that stuff that he would do collages with his photographs and paint and use text on them and cut them up and stuff like that ... I like a lot of people that use photography in kind of non-traditional ways. With Peter Beard, that was kind of my entry as a young person. Seeing that was really eye opening, kind of like, “Woah, you can do this!” It went from that to Jim Goldberg, someone who uses all different cameras and makes collages with his photos ... David Hockney is someone who, as a photographer, someone who I have really loved and opened my eyes a lot.

<doc id="621043" wikidata="Q131048" url="?curid=621043" title="Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale">
<text>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) Seismic Intensity Scale (known in Japan as the Shindo seismic scale) is a seismic intensity scale used in Japan to categorize the intensity of local ground shaking caused by earthquakes.

The JMA intensity scale differs from magnitude measurements like the moment magnitude (Mw) and the earlier Richter scales, which represent how much energy an earthquake releases. Similar to the Mercalli scale, the JMA scale measures the intensities of ground shaking &quot;at various observation points within the affected area&quot;. Intensities are expressed as numerical values called ; the higher the value, the more intense the shaking. Values are derived from ground acceleration and duration of the shaking, which are themselves influenced by factors such as distance to and depth of the hypocenter (focus), local soil conditions, and nature of the geology in between, as well as the event&#x27;s magnitude; every quake thus entails numerous intensities.

Intensity data is collected from 4,400 observation stations equipped with &quot;Model 95 seismic intensity meters&quot; that measure strong ground motion. The agency provides authorities and the general public with real-time reports through the media and Internet giving event time, epicenter (location), magnitude, and depth followed by intensity readings at affected localities.

==Scale overview==
The JMA scale is expressed in levels of seismic intensity from 0 to 7 in a manner similar to that of the Mercalli intensity scale, which is not commonly used in Japan. The JMA uses seismic intensity meters to automatically calculate ground acceleration in real-time, reporting intensities based on measurements from observation points.

== History ==
=== Establishment and revision ===
Seismic observations in Japan began in 1872. In 1884, Sekiya Seikei, Director of the Earthquake Division under the Home Ministry, compiled the 18-article &quot;Earthquake Report Guidelines&quot; and initiated data collection from 600 county offices nationwide. This was Japan’s first unified seismic intensity scale. At that time, the scale had four levels: , , , and . For example, a faint tremor event was described with a brief explanation, such as &quot;Slightly felt by those who have experience of earthquakes&quot;.

In 1898, the scale was expanded to include &quot;faint tremor (no sensation)&quot; and intermediate levels such as &quot;weak tremor (slightly weaker intensity)&quot; and &quot;strong tremor (slightly weaker intensity).&quot; The scale expanded to 7 levels, numbered from 0 to 6, but at this point, explanatory text was omitted. In 1908, explanatory text was reinstated for each level. In 1936, the &quot;Earthquake Observation Law,&quot; which is the current guideline for seismic observation, was established, and the terms for faint tremor (no sensation), weak tremor (slightly weaker intensity), and strong tremor (slightly weaker intensity) were renamed to &quot;no feeling,&quot; &quot;light tremor,&quot; and &quot;moderate tremor&quot;. During this time, the number of observation points further increased. According to materials from the JMA, in 1904, there were 1,437 observation points including both official stations and private contracted stations (e.g., local observation posts), and this number remained stable until the 1950s (around 1955-1964).

In January 1949, the &quot;Earthquake Observation Law&quot; was revised to establish intensity 7, and the scale was expanded to 8 levels, from 0 to 7; this was because concern arised that damage caused by the 1948 Fukui earthquake, which saw over 90% house collapse in some areas, could not be accurately expressed with intensity 6. Furthermore, the judgment for intensity 7 was based on a field survey conducted later by the JMA&#x27;s mobile observation team, with specific criteria like &quot;house collapse rate of 30% or more.&quot; During this revision, the terms &quot;no feeling,&quot; &quot;slight,&quot; &quot;weak,&quot; &quot;rather strong,&quot; &quot;strong,&quot; &quot;very strong,&quot; &quot;disastrous,&quot; and &quot;very disastrous&quot; were assigned to each intensity level. Seismic intensity was also made a factor in tsunami forecasting, and descriptions of the sensation of intensity 4 and 6 were added to the explanatory text for quicker judgment. Later, in 1978, the sensation of all intensity levels was added.

=== Transition to instrumental measurements ===
Previously, JMA staff determined seismic intensity by observing ground shaking and building damage, matching their observations to a guideline chart. Although guidelines existed, intensity assessments were subjective and lacked consistency. In the early years of the Heisei era, it took around 10 minutes or longer for each meteorological station to collect seismic information and issue a report along with the estimated scale.

Between 1958 and 1969, the number of seismic observation points dropped from over 1,000 to about 150 due to station consolidations and closures. As a result, issues such as a lack of seismic observation points, subjective judgments by observers, variability in damage from intensities above level 5, and delays in issuing intensity reports emerged. These challenges led to the consideration of using automatic instruments for seismic intensity measurement, and in 1985, a committee was established within the JMA to explore the use of instruments. In 1988, based on the committee&#x27;s report, experimental measurements using seismometers began, and by March 1994, seismometers were installed at all observation points. During this period, observation points increased to 300 in 1993 and 600 in 1996.

Meanwhile, major earthquakes such as the 1994 offshore Sanriku earthquake and the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake revealed issues like wide variability in damage in areas with intensities 5 and 6, as well as delays in determining intensity 7 (which required field surveys by the JMA’s mobile observation team). These issues highlighted the need for quicker and more detailed damage assessment.

On April 1, 1996, the scale was revised, eliminating sensory-based observations and fully transitioning to instrument-based measurements. This placed the JMA scale among non-Cancani macroseismic scales, distinguishing it from those belonging to the 12-degree Cancani family, such as the Modified Mercalli intensity scale or the European macroseismic scale. Levels 5 and 6 were subdivided into &quot;lower&quot; and &quot;upper,&quot; creating a 10-level scale. As a result, terms like &quot;faint tremor&quot; and &quot;light tremor&quot; were discontinued, and a new &quot;related explanatory table&quot; was created to provide explanations previously contained in the old descriptions. Additionally, seismic intensity level 7, which had been determined by damage rates, was standardized with instrumental observations, with a level of 6.5 or higher on the instrumental scale being classified as intensity 7 on the 10-level scale. Furthermore, in addition to the approximately 600 JMA observation points, data from around 800 sites operated by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) and about 2,800 local government sites were also used for JMA reports, increasing the total number of observation points to about 4,200, a significant increase from previous levels.

== Intensity 7 ==
Intensity 7 (, &quot;Shindo-nana&quot;) is the highest level on the JMA seismic intensity scale. At Intensity 7, movement at will is almost impossible, and people may be thrown through the air. The intensity was created following the 1948 Fukui earthquake. It was observed for the first time in the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake.
== Seismic intensity measurement ==

=== Observation system ===
Since April 1997, Japan has been using specialized and automated strong ground motion accelerometers known as the &quot;seismic intensity meter&quot; to measure and report the strength of earthquakes based on the JMA scale. This replaces the old system that relied on human observation and damage assessment.

The installation of these meters began in 1988 with the &quot;Model 87 seismic intensity meter,&quot; which were not capable of storing data and could only observe a moderate acceleration range. Later, the &quot;Model 95 seismic intensity meter&quot; was introduced, which had several improvements including the ability to observe acceleration higher than previous limits, a higher sampling rate and better resolution, along with the capability to record observed data in flash memory cards. As of March 1997, all of JMA&#x27;s seismic intensity meters were replaced by this &quot;Model 95&quot; type.

By the end of 2009, about 4,200 of these meters were in use for JMA&#x27;s &quot;seismic intensity information,&quot; and by January 2023, this number had grown to around 4,400. Of these meters, around 700 are managed by the JMA, and roughly 3,700 by the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience (NIED) and local government bodies. The JMA&#x27;s meters are equipped with satellite communication mechanisms that allow them to transmit data in case of landline malfunctions; in the event of a major earthquake, the JMA assesses the integrity of its meters and/or set up temporary observation stations where necessary.

Besides the seismic intensity meters used by JMA, many other meters have been installed by local government bodies that are not used by JMA. Public institutions and transportation agencies have installed their own meters to monitor critical infrastructure such as dams, rivers, and railways.

=== Instrument installation ===
To ensure accurate earthquake intensity measurements, specific guidelines govern the proper installation of seismic intensity meters. The JMA excludes data from meters placed in unsuitable locations when assessing earthquake intensity.

Meters must be installed on robust, specially designed stands. Because embankments and cliffs can amplify ground shaking, it is crucial to place meters on flat, stable ground away from steps. At least two-thirds of the stand must be securely buried in the ground. Additionally, meters should be positioned far enough from nearby structures, such as trees or fences, to avoid potential impact from falling objects.

For indoor installations, meters should be placed on the ground floor near pillars, with acceptable locations ranging from the basement to the second floor. Buildings with earthquake isolation or vibration control systems are unsuitable for meter placement.

The JMA evaluates the installation quality of seismic intensity meters used for official earthquake intensity information. Each installation is scored based on its environmental conditions, with total scores assigned a grade from A to E. Installations graded A to C are deemed acceptable. D-rated meters may be used after thorough evaluation, while E-rated meters are excluded from use.

There have been instances where earthquake intensity data was used despite meters being installed in unsuitable locations, leading to questions about the accuracy of the information and subsequent corrections. One notable example occurred during the July 2008 Iwate earthquake, when Intensity 6+ was recorded in Ono, Hirono Town, Iwate Prefecture. This value was significantly higher than those reported in neighboring municipalities, prompting an investigation. On October 29 of the same year, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) concluded that the meter in Ono was improperly installed for earthquake observation. As a result, it was removed from the earthquake intensity data, and the recorded maximum intensity was revised from 6+ to 6−.

=== Intensity calculation ===

The seismic intensity meters used by the JMA and others observe shaking through accelerometers. They first measure three components of acceleration – vertical, north–south, and east–west – as time-domain signals. These are then converted into frequency-domain signals by the Fourier transform, filtered, then converted back into time-domain signals for final calculations. The specific process involved is as follows:

# Apply the Fourier transform on time-domain signals to convert them into frequency-domain signals.
# Apply a filter formula_1, which is a product of several filters, to the frequency-domain signals, where formula_2 is the period effect filter; formula_3 is the high-cut filter, where formula_4, formula_5, formula_6, formula_7, formula_8, formula_9, formula_10; formula_11 is the low-cut filter.
# Convert the filtered frequency-domain signals back into time-domain signals by inverse Fourier transform. Sum the acceleration components into a single composite acceleration by vector summation.
# Find a value formula_12 such that for exactly 0.3 seconds, the norm of the acceleration vector is no less than formula_12.
# Calculate formula_14.
# Round formula_15 to two decimal places, then truncate the second decimal place to determine the instrumental seismic intensity. Then, round the instrumental seismic intensity to the nearest integer to determine the seismic intensity. If the instrumental seismic intensity is negative, the seismic intensity is considered 0; if ≥8, the seismic intensity is considered 7. In case of Intensities 5 and 6, it is further divided into lower and upper depending on whether it is rounded up or down (refer to the table on the right).

== Information dissemination ==

=== Earthquake Information bulletins ===
When an earthquake occurs, the JMA announces the observed seismic intensity, the epicenter of the earthquake, and the presence or absence of a tsunami as “Earthquake Information&quot; bulletins. Among them, those related to seismic intensity are listed below.

* Seismic Intensity Information: About a minute and a half after the earthquake, the JMA announces names of sub-prefectural regions observing Intensity 3 or higher.
* Earthquake and Seismic Intensity Information: If Intensity 1 or higher is observed, the JMA announces the hypocenter and magnitude of the event, seismic intensity observation points observing Intensity 1 or higher, and localities observing Intensity 3 or higher.
* Estimated Seismic Intensity Distribution Map: If Intensity 5− or higher is observed, the JMA issues an Estimated Seismic Intensity Distribution Map showing expected seismic intensity based on observational data, taking into account site amplification effects. The map contains seismic intensity distribution of areas observing Intensity 4 or higher. The seismic intensity distribution was estimated on a 1km square grid before January 31, 2023, and on a 250m square grid since February 1, 2023.

When the initial seismic waves are observed at multiple locations and the maximum intensity is estimated to be at least 5−, an Earthquake Early Warning is issued for areas with an estimated intensity of 4 or higher. This is an alert to warn of strong earthquake tremors, not the observed seismic intensity.

Seismic intensity information is distributed to numerous parties, including mobile network operators, businesses licensed for earthquake forecasting or information dissemination, media outlets, Fire and Disaster Management Agency, prefectural governments, police, Japan Coast Guard and other designated public authorities, who then disseminate the information to the general public.

=== Internet ===
The JMA distributes earthquake information on its website, including information on time of occurrence, hypocenter location, depth, and seismic intensities across different regions.

On March 7, 2013, the JMA updated its website’s color scheme for earthquake information to unify weather displays and improve accessibility for visually impaired and elderly users. All seismic intensity indicators are now displayed in different colors. Intensity 7 is indicated in dark purple (), 6+ indicated in dark red (), 6− indicated in red (), 5+ indicated in orange (), 5− indicated in yellow (), 4 indicated in cream (), 3 indicated in blue (), 2 indicated in light blue () and 1 indicated in white ().

The display for the epicenter was also modified. Previously, a red “×” mark () was used; after the update, a red “×” mark with a yellow border is now used.

Many Japanese news outlets also have dedicated pages on their websites distributing earthquake information, including seismic intensity information, from the JMA. Other major platforms also disseminate seismic intensity information, either through web, mobile apps or both, such as Yahoo Japan, Weathernews, and the NERV Disaster Prevention mobile app.

=== NIED strong-motion monitor ===
The National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience distributes realtime instrumental seismic intensity, peak ground acceleration, velocity, displacement, and velocity response of different frequencies (0.125Hz − 4.0Hz) data across stations of its network through a web service called the Strong-motion Monitor (強震モニタ).

The web service displays information on ongoing Earthquake Early Warning bulletins, realtime intensities at all observation points as an image, estimated epicenter location and expected propagation of P waves and S waves, along with predicted seismic intensity distribution represented as a 5km square grid.

Various other businesses also provide access to the Strong-motion Monitor through their own platforms, such as Yahoo Japan through a web app and Gehirn Inc through their &quot;NERV Disaster Prevention&quot; mobile app.

== Disaster response based on seismic intensity ==
Administrative agencies obtain seismic intensity information from the JMA and other sources and use this information as a criterion for deciding the initial actions to be taken immediately after an earthquake. Generally, at Intensity 4 to 5− or higher, the National Police Agency and Fire and Disaster Management Agency (through a line of prefectural police headquarters to police stations, and prefectural fire and disaster management divisions to fire headquarters) begin investigations. If the intensity reaches 5− or higher, the Japan Coast Guard and Ministry of Defense carry out damage assessments. Specifically, helicopters from the regional Coast Guard offices that recorded the maximum intensity, fighter jets scrambled by Air Self-Defense Force squadrons, and maritime patrol aircraft deployed by the Maritime Self-Defense Force are dispatched, and the crews conduct visual inspections. Additionally, if the intensity reaches 4 or higher, the Cabinet Office estimates earthquake damage. When an intensity of 5+ is recorded in Tokyo&#x27;s 23 wards or 6− or higher elsewhere, the Emergency Response Team of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office calls an emergency meeting.

Since October 2007, the JMA has implemented the Earthquake Early Warning system for the general public. This system issues warnings when the estimated maximum intensity is 5− or greater, targeting regions expected to feel an intensity of 4 or more. For advanced users, the criteria include observations of ground accelerations over 100 gal, an estimated magnitude of 3.5 or higher, and an estimated maximum intensity of 3 or greater.

While the current intensity scale is emphasized for very short periods (0.1 to 1 second) that match human perception, damage to buildings is often associated with periods of 1 to 2 seconds. It has been proposed that for higher intensity levels, calculating intensity based on the elastic velocity response at 1 to 2 seconds correlates more closely with building damage and maintains continuity with the pre-1996 seismic intensity scale derived from observed damage.

Additionally, unlike traditional macroseismic scales, the modern JMA scale determines intensity using instrumental ground motion data, rather than observed effects. A paper by Musson et al. argues that this reliance has distanced the scale from macroseismology&#x27;s original purpose: to describe human and structural impacts of earthquakes. The JMA scale’s reliance on Japanese ground motion parameters and its unique subdivisions also makes it less suited for international comparisons with other scales, posing challenges when used outside Japan.

== Use outside Japan ==
In Taiwan, the seismic intensity scale used is a 10-point system similar to Japan’s, known as the Central Weather Administration seismic intensity scale. Prior to this, Taiwan had adopted a scale identical to Japan&#x27;s pre-September 1996 system, which had been established on August 1, 2000. However, this earlier scale did not include the subdivisions of intensity levels 5 and 6 into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; categories, which had been introduced later in Japan.

In South Korea, a seismic intensity scale modeled after Japan’s was used in the past, but since 2001, the country has switched to the Modified Mercalli intensity scale.

<text>The Three Sisters () are the three main agricultural crops of various indigenous people of Central and North America: squash, maize (&quot;corn&quot;), and climbing beans (typically tepary beans or common beans). In a technique known as companion planting, the maize and beans are often planted together in mounds formed by hilling soil around the base of the plants each year; squash is typically planted between the mounds. The cornstalk serves as a trellis for climbing beans, the beans fix nitrogen in their root nodules and stabilize the maize in high winds, and the wide leaves of the squash plant shade the ground, keeping the soil moist and helping prevent the establishment of weeds.

Indigenous peoples throughout North America cultivated different varieties of the Three Sisters, adapted to varying local environments.
The individual crops and their use in polyculture originated in Mesoamerica, where squash was domesticated first, followed by maize and then beans, over a period of 5,000–6,500 years. European records from the sixteenth century describe highly productive Indigenous agriculture based on cultivation of the Three Sisters throughout what are now the Eastern United States and Canada, where the crops were used for both food and trade.
Geographer Carl O. Sauer described the Three Sisters as &quot;a symbiotic plant complex of North and Central America without an equal elsewhere&quot;.

== Cultivation methods ==

Agricultural history in the Americas differed from the Old World in that the Americas lacked large-seeded, easily domesticated grains (such as wheat and barley) and large domesticated animals that could be used for agricultural labor. At the time of first contact between the Europeans and the Americans, Carlos Sempat Assadourian writes that Europeans practiced &quot;extensive agriculture, based on the plough and draught animals&quot; while the Indigenous peoples of the Americas practiced &quot;intensive agriculture, based on human labour&quot;.

In Indigenous American companion planting, maize (&quot;Zea mays&quot;), beans (wild beans and vetches spp.), and squash (&quot;Cucurbita pepo&quot;) are planted close together. The maize and beans are often planted together in mounds formed by hilling soil around the base of the plants each year; squash is typically planted between the mounds. In the northeastern U.S., this practice increases soil temperature in the mound and improves drainage, both of which benefit maize planted in spring. 
In Haudenosaunee or Iroquois farming, the fields were not tilled, enhancing soil fertility and the sustainability of the cropping system by limiting soil erosion and oxidation of soil organic matter. A modern experiment found that the Haudenosaunee Three Sisters polyculture provided both more energy and more protein than any local monoculture.

The three crops benefit by being grown together. The cornstalk serves as a trellis for the beans to climb, the beans fix nitrogen in the soil, and their twining vines stabilize the maize in high winds, and the wide leaves of the squash plant shade the ground, keeping the soil moist and helping prevent the establishment of weeds. The prickly hairs of some squash varieties deter pests, such as deer and raccoons.

Although this synergy had been traditionally reputed among American cultures, scientific confirmation has arrived only much more recently. Much of this research was performed in the Soviet Union in the early 1970s and published in several volumes of &quot;Biochemical and Physiological Bases for Plant Interactions in Phytocenosis&quot; edited by . Dzubenko &amp; Petrenko 1971, Lykhvar &amp; Nazarova 1970 and Pronin &quot;et al.&quot; 1970 find a wide number of leguminous crops increase the growth and yield of maize, while Gulyaev &quot;et al.&quot; 1970 select later maturing lines of beans to produce the converse effect, increasing even further the yield gain of beans when planted with maize. Pronin &quot;et al.&quot; 1972 find increased productivity and root exudate in both crops when combining faba beans with maize, and even more so in soils with preexisting high nitrogen fixing microorganism activity.

Indigenous peoples throughout North America cultivated different varieties of the Three Sisters, adapted to varying local environments.
The milpas of Mesoamerica are farms or gardens that employ companion planting on a larger scale. The Ancestral Puebloans adopted this garden design in the drier deserts and xeric shrublands environment. The Tewa and other peoples of the North American Southwest often included a &quot;fourth Sister&quot;, the Rocky Mountain beeplant, which attracts bees to help pollinate the beans and squash. The Three Sisters crop model was widely used by a number of First Nations in the Great Lakes–St. Lawrence Lowlands region.

== Productivity ==

European records from the sixteenth century describe highly productive Indigenous agriculture based on cultivation of the Three Sisters throughout what are now the Eastern United States and Canada, from Florida to Ontario. The geographer Carl O. Sauer described the Three Sisters as &quot;a symbiotic plant complex of North and Central America without an equal elsewhere&quot;. The agronomist Jane Mt. Pleasant writes that the Three Sisters mound system &quot;enhances the soil physical and biochemical environment, minimizes soil erosion, improves soil tilth, manages plant population and spacing, provides for plant nutrients in appropriate quantities, and at the time needed, and controls weeds&quot;. After several thousand years of selective breeding, the hemisphere&#x27;s most important crop, maize, was more productive than Old World grain crops. Maize produced two and one-half times more calories per given land area than wheat and barley.

Nutritionally, maize, beans, and squash contain all nine essential amino acids. The protein from maize is further enhanced by protein contributions from beans and pumpkin seeds, while pumpkin flesh provides large amounts of vitamin A; with the Three Sisters, farmers harvest about the same amount of energy as from maize monoculture, but get more protein yield from the inter-planted bean and pumpkin. Mt. Pleasant writes that this largely explains the value of the Three Sisters over monoculture cropping, as the system yields large amounts of energy, and at the same time increases protein yields; this polyculture cropping system yielded more food and supported more people per hectare compared to monocultures of the individual crops or mixtures of monocultures.

=== Yields ===

Scholars Mt. Pleasant and Burt reproduced Iroquois methods of cultivation with Iroquoian varieties of maize at several locations in New York. They reported maize yields of 22 to 76 bushels per acre (). Soil fertility and weather were the main determinants of yield. Mt. Pleasant also questioned the conventional wisdom that the Iroquois practiced slash-and-burn agriculture, abandoning fields when the soil was depleted of nutrients after several years of farming, but instead claimed that Iroquoian no-till farming techniques preserved soil fertility. In a similar experiment to reproduce Native American agricultural practices in Minnesota, Munson-Scullin and Scullin reported that over three years, the per-acre annual maize yields declined from 40 to 30 to 25 bushels (). 

Other scholars have estimated lower average yields of maize. Hart and Feranec estimated the yield of Huron agriculture at 8 to 22 bushels per acre (), the higher yields coming from newly cultivated land. The Huron lived in Ontario near the northern limit of where agriculture was feasible and had less fertile soils than many other regions. Nevertheless, they produced surpluses for trading with nearby non-agricultural peoples. Bruce Trigger estimates that the Hurons required of land under cultivation per capita for their subsistence with more cultivated land required for trade. Sissel Schroeder estimates that the average yield of Native American farms in the 19th century was 18.9 bushels per acre (), but opines that pre-historic yields might have been as low as 10 bushels per acre (). As the Iroquois and other Native Americans did not plow their land, Mt. Pleasant and Burt concluded that their lands retained more organic matter and thus were higher in yields of maize than early Euro-American farms in North America.

== Society and culture ==

Maize, beans, and squash, whether grown individually or together, have a very long history in the Americas. 
The process to develop the agricultural knowledge for cultivation took place over a 5,000 to 6,500 year period. Squash was domesticated first, with maize second and beans third. Squash was first domesticated some 8,000–10,000 years ago.

=== Cahokian, Mississippian and Muscogee culture ===
From 800 AD, Three Sisters crop organization was used in the largest Native American city north of the Rio Grande known as Cahokia, located in the Mississippi floodplain to the east of modern St. Louis, Missouri. It spanned over and supported populations of at least thousands. Cahokia was notable for its delineated community zones, including those for administration, several residential areas, and a large agricultural complex. Domesticated squash, gourds, and maize were initially grown alongside wild beans; domesticated beans were not grown at Cahokia until 1250. The cultivation of the Three Sisters crops by Cahokian residents produced a food surplus large enough to support Cahokia&#x27;s expanded population, as well as further cultures throughout the extended Mississippi River system such as those of the Mississippian and Muscogee.

There is evidence that Cahokia held at least one great feast around 1050-1100 AD. The food served at these gatherings included, alongside a variety of other plants and animals, several domesticated squash varieties, maize, and wild beans. Food that needed to be processed, like cornmeal, would commonly be prepared at the feast site alongside non-food items that gave the feasts ritual or ceremonial importance.

Eventual overuse of the environment in the areas surrounding Cahokia began to degrade the land. As the surrounding woodlands were cleared through overuse, runoff frequently flooded the crop fields throughout the growing season, limiting the ability to grow the squash, maize, and corn Cahokia subsisted upon. By , the Cahokia site had been mostly abandoned and the large population dispersed, though the Mississippian and Muscogee cultures continued to thrive until , when contact with Spanish explorers brought Eurasian diseases, death, and cultural collapse.

=== Haudenosaunee culture ===
In the &quot;Handbook of North American Indians&quot;, the Three Sisters are called the &quot;foundation of (Iroquois) subsistence&quot;, allowing the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois to develop the institutions of sedentary life.
The Three Sisters appear prominently in Haudenosaunee oral traditions and ceremonies, such as Iroquois myths and the Haudenosaunee Thanksgiving Address.

According to legend, the Three Sisters grew out of Earth Woman&#x27;s dead body. During the time of creation, Sky Woman fell to Earth, where she had a daughter named Earth Woman. With the west wind, Earth Woman conceived twin sons. The first twin, Sapling, was born normally, but his evil twin brother, Flint, was so impatient that he came out of his mother&#x27;s side, killing her during childbirth. As Earth Woman died, either she wished for her body to sustain the people or Sky Woman sowed on her grave the seeds she had brought when she fell to Earth, but never planted before. Out of Earth Woman&#x27;s body parts grew various plants: the spirits of the corn, beans, and squash came from her breasts, hands, and navel respectively; sunflowers from her legs; strawberries from her heart; tobacco from her head; and purple potatoes or sunchokes from her feet.

It is said that in 1779, Seneca Chief Handsome Lake wished to die after the US military killed Haudenosaunee communities and villagers. Handsome Lake, grief-stricken, envisioned a visit by the spirits of the Three Sisters, prompting him to return to and re-teach his fellow Haudenosaunee their traditional agricultural practices.

Researchers in the early 20th century described more than a dozen varieties of maize and similar numbers of bean varieties, as well as many types of squash, such as pumpkin and winter squash, grown in Haudenosaunee communities. The first academic description of the Three Sisters cropping system in 1910 reported that the Iroquois preferred to plant the three crops together, since it took less time and effort than planting them individually, and because they believed the plants were &quot;guarded by three inseparable spirits and would not thrive apart&quot;. 

Among the Haudenosaunee, women were responsible for cultivation and distribution of the three crops, which raised their social status. Male roles traditionally included extended periods of travel, such as for hunting expeditions, diplomatic missions, or military raids. Men took part in the initial preparation for the planting of the Three Sisters by clearing the planting ground, after which groups of related women, working communally, performed the planting, weeding, and harvesting.
Based on archaeological findings, paleobotanist John Hart concludes that the Haudenosaunee began growing the three crops as a polyculture sometime after 700 BP. 
The Haudenosaunee frequently traded their crops, so the need for each crop could vary substantially from year to year. Jane Mt. Pleasant surmises that the Haudenosaunee may have typically inter-planted the three crops, but they could also have planted monocultures of the individual crops to meet specific needs.

=== Maya culture ===
The Maya diet focused on the Three Sisters. Maize was the central component of the diet of the ancient Maya and figured prominently in Maya mythology and ideology. Archaeological evidence suggests that Chapalote-Nal-Tel was the dominant maize species, though it is likely others were being exploited also.

==Folklore==
Numerous legends from indigenous cultures surround the existence and production of the Three Sister crops.

One legend personifies the crops as three human sisters. The first sister, who represents beans, is described as a toddler dressed in green. The second sister, who represents squash, is a slightly older child dressed in a yellow Frock, or dress. The eldest of the three, who represents corn, is often described as wearing a pale green shawl and having long, yellow hair. 

These three sisters are repeatedly visited by a young Indigenous boy, impressing them with his character and hunting skills, specifically archery. With each visit, one of the three sisters disappears until the eldest is left alone. As such, she begins to mourn. When the Indigenous boy visits again during the season of harvest, he overhears the eldest sister&#x27;s cries and brings her back to his mother and father&#x27;s lodge to cheer her up. There, the eldest is reunited with her sisters who had stayed with the Indigenous boy out of curiosity. From that point onwards, the three sisters never separated again.

<text>Naked City was an avant-garde music group led by saxophonist and composer John Zorn. Active primarily in New York City from 1988 to 1993, Naked City was initiated by Zorn as a &quot;composition workshop&quot; to test the limits of composition (and improvisation) in a traditional rock band lineup. Their music incorporated elements of jazz, surf, progressive rock, classical, heavy metal, grindcore, country, punk rock, and other genres.

==History==
Named after a 1945 book of graphic black and white photographs by Weegee, the band performed an aggressive mix of &quot;soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [and] metallic funk&quot;. In Naked City&#x27;s characteristic early style, songs were often performed at astonishingly fast tempos, drawing on thrash metal and hardcore punk&#x27;s emphasis on extreme speed. Many songs were quite brief, and typically switched musical genres every few measures. One critic described the band&#x27;s music as &quot;jump-cutting micro-collages of hardcore, country, sleazy jazz, covers of John Barry and Ornette Coleman, brief abstract tussles—a whole city crammed into two or three minute bursts&quot;. This fast-change tendency was inspired in part by Carl Stalling—a Zorn favorite—who wrote music for many Warner Bros. cartoons, that featured frequent shifts in tempo, theme and style.

Naked City&#x27;s first album was distributed under Zorn&#x27;s name by Nonesuch Records and featured a Weegee photograph of a dead gangster on its cover, along with macabre illustrations by Maruo Suehiro. Zorn stated that &quot;Naked City started with rhythm and blues/&quot;Spillane&quot; type things then went into this hard-core thing ... because I was living in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection ... My interest in hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces.&quot; There was disagreement between Zorn and the label over cover art on subsequent albums. Zorn wanted to use explicit S&amp;M pictures, images from 19th century medical archives, and execution photographs, most notoriously of a Leng Tch&#x27;e victim; Nonesuch refused. Zorn ended his relationship with the label, releasing subsequent Naked City albums on Shimmy Disc and his own Avant and Tzadik labels. 

The album &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (1989) featured &quot;hardcore miniatures&quot;, intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute. Some of these tracks had also featured on the band&#x27;s debut and others would resurface on the band&#x27;s next full-length release, &quot;Grand Guignol&quot; (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Heretic&quot; (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film &quot;Jeux des Dames Cruelles&quot;. The band released &quot;Leng Tch&#x27;e&quot;, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. &quot;Radio&quot;, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.

The final recording from the band, &quot;Absinthe&quot; (1993), featured a blend of ambient noise-styled compositions with tracks titled after the works of Paul Verlaine, Charles Baudelaire and other figures in the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; Decadent movement, and a dedication to Olivier Messiaen.

Zorn discontinued Naked City when he felt &quot;the need to write music for other ensembles, in other contexts, with new ideas&quot;. A brief 15th anniversary reunion occurred in 2003 for two shows in Amsterdam and Warsaw respectively.

== Cinematic connections ==
The group covered numerous film soundtrack cuts, including work by Georges Delerue. &quot;Heretic&quot; was intended as the soundtrack for a film starring Karen Finley.

The tracks &quot;Bonehead&quot; and &quot;Hellraiser&quot;, from &quot;Torture Garden&quot;, are featured in the opening sequence of Michael Haneke&#x27;s film &quot;Funny Games&quot; and its 2007 remake.

<doc id="621056" wikidata="Q595772" url="?curid=621056" title="Krumping">
<text>Krumping is a global culture that evolved through African-American street dancing popularized in the United States during the early 2000s, characterized by free, expressive, exaggerated, and highly energetic movement. The people who originated krumping saw the dance as a means for them to escape gang life.

== Origins ==
The root word &quot;krump&quot; came from the lyrics of a 1990 song and is sometimes explained as a backronym for Kingdom Radically Uplifted Mighty Praise, which presents krumping as a faith-based art form. Krumping was created by dancers: Ceasare &quot;Tight Eyez&quot; Willis, Marquisa &quot;Miss Prissy&quot; Gardner, Christopher &quot;Lil&#x27; C&quot; Toler and Jo&#x27;Artis &quot;Big Mijo&quot; Ratti in South Central, Los Angeles, during the early 2000s. &quot;Clowning&quot; is the less aggressive predecessor to krumping and was created in 1992 by Thomas &quot;Tommy the Clown&quot; Johnson in Compton, California.

In the 1990s, Johnson and his dancers—known as the Hip Hop Clowns—performed clowning for children&#x27;s’ birthday parties and other general-public functions. In contrast, krumping focuses on highly-energetic battles and dramatic movements which Tommy the Clown describes as intense, fast-paced, and sharp. CBS News compared the intensity of krumping to that of moshing. Although krumping was not directly created by Tommy, it was inspired by his “clowning”. Originally, Willis and Ratti were clown dancers for Tommy, but as their dancing was considered too &quot;rugged&quot; and &quot;raw&quot; for clowning, they left and developed krumping. Tommy eventually opened a clown-dancing academy and started the Battle Zone competition at the Great Western Forum where krump crews and clown crews could come together and battle each other in front of an audience of their peers.

== Spread and influence ==
David LaChapelle&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Rize,&quot; explores the clowning and krumping subculture in Los Angeles. He says of the movement: &quot;What Nirvana was to rock-and-roll in the early &#x27;90s is what these kids are to hip-hop. It&#x27;s the alternative to the bling-bling, tie-in-with-a-designer corporate hip-hop thing.&quot; LaChapelle was first introduced to krumping when he was directing Christina Aguilera&#x27;s music video &quot;Dirrty&quot;. After deciding to make a documentary about krumping, LaChapelle produced a short film titled &quot;Krumped,&quot; which was screened at the 2004 Aspen Shortsfest, and gained more funding to produce a longer version as a result of the positive response. In 2005, the longer version was released as &quot;Rize&quot; and screened at the Sundance Film Festival, the Auckland International Film Festival, and several other film festivals outside the United States.

Krumping’s global spread owes much to the efforts of key figures like Christopher “Lil C” Toler and Marquesa “Miss Prissy” Gardner. Lil C’s appearance as a judge on So You Think You Can Dance brought Krumping into the homes of millions worldwide, further solidifying his role as an ambassador of the style. Miss Prissy, often referred to as the “Queen of Krump,” not only contributed significantly to the documentary Rize, but also performed with major artists like Madonna, helping to popularize Krumping internationally. Both dancers continue to inspire new generations of Krumpers through their performances, teaching, and choreography.

Aside from &quot;Rize&quot;, krumping appeared in several music videos including Missy Elliott&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Really Hot”, The Black Eyed Peas&#x27; &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, Chemical Brothers&#x27; &quot;Galvanize&quot; and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;Hung Up&quot;. Krumping is also demonstrated in Skinny Puppy&#x27;s &quot;Pro-Test&quot; video, and displays several other aspects of krumping.

Krumping has also appeared in the movies &quot;Bring It On: All or Nothing&quot;, &quot;Step Up&quot;, &quot;Stomp the Yard&quot; and &quot;Climax&quot;; the television series &quot;Community;&quot; and the reality dance competitions &quot;So You Think You Can Dance&quot;, &quot;Street Dance of China,&quot; and &quot;America&#x27;s Best Dance Crew&quot;. Russell Ferguson. The original web series &quot;The Legion of Extraordinary Dancers&quot; also featured a krump dance in season one during the fifth episode, &quot;The Lettermakers.&quot; It has also spawned &quot;Marge Krumping&quot;, a 2016 meme taken from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Little Orphan Millie,&quot; where the character Marge tries to cheer up Bart by krumping, albeit unsuccessfully.

Krumping has since spread to many countries around the world.

==Style==
There are five basic moves in krumping: stomps, jabs, chest pops, Buck hop, and arm swings. Krumping is rarely choreographed; it is almost entirely freestyle to a song (improvisational) and is danced most frequently in battles or sessions rather than on a stage. Krump is stylistically different from other hip-hop dance styles such as breaking and turfing. Krumping is very aggressive and is danced upright to upbeat and fast-paced music, but it does not promote aggression or fighting – moves are meant to take up space and challenge other dancers to feed off and return the energy, whereas breaking is more acrobatic and is danced on the floor to break beats. The Oakland dance style turfing is a fusion of popping and miming that incorporates storytelling and illusion. Krump is less precise, and more freestyle, than turfing. Thematically, all these dance styles align under the term street dance as they all share common attributes of their street origins, their freestyle nature and the use of battling.

==Vocabulary==

* Battle: A direct dance competition often featuring concepts, materials, combos, and get-offs.
* Biter: Someone who attends sessions or watches battles in order to feed on others&#x27; styles and originality, so that they can mimic those moves later at another battle and pass them off as their own inventions, i.e. plagiarism.
* Session: When a group of krumpers form a semi-circle, or &quot;cypher&quot; in hip-hop context, and, one by one, go into the middle and freestyle.
* Buck: An adjective used to describe someone who excels in krump, as well as high-quality adherence to the tenets of the Krump ethos.
* Live: An adjective used to describe someone raising the energy in the session or battle.
* Call-out: A krumper&#x27;s initiation or request for battle with another krumper.
* Lab: Deliberate experimentation by krumpers, either by themselves or with other krumpers, to create new concepts and/or advance their style.
* Get-off: A set of movements that determines that a krumper&#x27;s round is over, usually a pattern consisting solely of foundations, bang-outs, or arm-swings.
* Kill-off: A set of movements that excites the crowd to the point where the battle is over and the crowd surrounds the krumper; the opponent is &quot;killed off&quot;, hence the name.
* Krumper: A dancer who specializes in krumping.
* Krumpography: Krump used as a choreography.
* Concept: An abstract movement that helps krumpers tell a story.
* Material: A material movement krumpers use to show a random item to further storytelling, e.g. pouring water on the ground and slipping.
* Jab: A short, sharp, staccato movement of the arms. The krumper extends them from the chest outwards, and with the same energy, pulls it back.
* Stomp: Rhythmically driving the foot into and up from the ground in a way that the krumpers appear to get their energy from the ground itself.
* Chest pop: An upward motion of the chest in the same manner as breathing into the lungs; krumpers usually do chest pops to inhale while in a session or in a round.
* Arm swing: Moving an arm in a sweeping motion aided by gravity. There are two types of arm swings: small arm swings and big arm swings. Small arm swings are similar to the motions involved in pitching a baseball, while big arm swings are analogous to using the whole arm as a baseball bat.
* Praise Krump: The art of krumping set to religious songs.
* Storyline: A set of combos performed by krumpers to build up the hype and push the spazz meter to an appropriate moment for getting off or killing off their opponents.
* Hype: The intense feeling of being swept away; for example, if a krumper does buckness (see next section), carries out a unique dance move, or kills the music, the crowd is hyped up, thus leading to a kill-off. A common krump audience perception is that the hype comes from the krumpers&#x27; moves, but krumpers also get their hype and boost their spazz meter from the crowd.
* Spazz meter: A term used to determine the level or extent of the hype.
* Buck talk: The act of trash talking while in a Krump battle.

==Round storyline terminology==

*Atmosphere: Feeling the vibe of the environment and having the environment feel the krumpers&#x27; presence.
*Intro: Starting one&#x27;s rounds; usually with small movements, sometimes used to introduce a krumper&#x27;s character or concept.
*Rounds: A set of combos, materials, concepts, and foundations taken together.
*Buckness: The part of the storyline where krumpers are already hyped up with their rounds, showing a series of heavy and/or fast movements; usually done with a stance of the knees slightly bent, while the arms and feet are moved far out in front of the lower extremities of the body.
*Krump: The part of the storyline where the krumper is doing a series of foundations, concepts, and materials while standing upright, while the arms and feet are moving in front of the upper extremities of the body.
*Liveness: The part of the storyline where the krumper is doing a series of foundations, concepts, and materials, with the body bent upward, while the arms and feet are moving outside of the body, either upwards or to the sides.
*Get-off: The part of the storyline where the krumper is expressing feelings most intensely, letting out by rapidly showing repetitive movements such as bang-outs, jabs and redundancy.

<text>Spider mites are members of the family Tetranychidae, which includes about 1,200 species. They are part of the subclass Acari (mites). Spider mites generally live on the undersides of leaves of plants, where they may spin protective silk webs, and can cause damage by puncturing the plant cells to feed. Spider mites are known to feed on several hundred species of plants.

==Description==
Spider mites are less than in size and vary in color. They lay small, spherical, initially transparent eggs and many species spin silk webbing to help protect the colony from predators; they get the &quot;spider&quot; part of their common name from this webbing.

==Life cycle==

Hot, dry conditions are often associated with population build-up of spider mites. Under optimal conditions (approximately 27 °C), the two-spotted spider mite can hatch in as little as 3 days, and become sexually mature in as little as 5 days. One female can lay up to 20 eggs per day and can live for 2 to 4 weeks, laying hundreds of eggs. This accelerated reproductive rate allows spider mite populations to adapt quickly to resist pesticides, so chemical control methods can become somewhat ineffectual when the same pesticide is used over a prolonged period.

Spider mites, like hymenopterans and some scale insects, are haplodiploid and therefore arrhenotochous: females are diploid and males are haploid. When mated, females avoid the fecundation of some eggs to produce males. Fertilized eggs produce diploid females. Unmated, unfertilized females still lay eggs that originate exclusively haploid males.

To spread to new locations, they make use of ballooning for aerial dispersal.

==Genera==
The best known member of the group is &quot;Tetranychus urticae&quot;, which has a cosmopolitan distribution, and attacks a wide range of plants, including peppers, tomatoes, potatoes, beans, corn, cannabis, and strawberries. Other species which can be important pests of commercial plants include &quot;Panonychus ulmi&quot; (fruit tree red spider mite) and &quot;Panonychus citri&quot; (citrus red mite).

The family is divided into these subfamilies, tribes and genera:

==Countermeasures==

===Predatory mites===
Predatory mites of the family Phytoseiidae, including &quot;Phytoseiulus persimilis&quot;, eat adult mites, their eggs, and all developmental stages between. Predatory mites can consume as many as 5 adult spider mites per day, or 20 eggs per day.

===Harpin Alpha Beta===
In some cases, the application of Harpin Alpha Beta protein may help in the treatment and prevention of infestation by stimulating the plant&#x27;s natural defenses, restoring sap sugar levels and encouraging replacement of damaged tissues. This affects the spider mites&#x27; ability to down-regulate the immune response of a plant.

===Acaricides===
Acaricides are applied to crops to control spider mites. They can be either systemic or non-systemic in nature and can be persistent by providing residual activity for over a month. Drawbacks include high potential for development of resurgence and resistance in mite populations, as has been observed in previous generations of miticides, and toxicity of some miticides towards fish. Thus proper selection, precautions and application are required to minimize risks.

===Environmental conditions===
Temporarily modifying environmental conditions has proven an effective method for insect pest control including spider mites. Generally dramatically decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide concentrations at elevated temperatures can lead to mortality at all developmental stages. However mild CO2 enrichment has been shown to in fact increase mite reproduction. One study determined a concentration of 0.4% O2 and 20% CO2 gave a LT99 (time to 99% mortality) of 113h at 20 °C and 15.5h at 40 °C. Another study reported 100% mortality of various stages of the two spotted spidermite using 60% CO2 and 20% O2 at 30 °C for 16h.
Advantages would include decreased ability for resistance development compared to miticides and potential ease of application while drawbacks might include sensitivity of the plant to the conditions, feasibility of application, and human safety.

<text>America&#x27;s Next Top Model (abbreviated ANTM and Top Model) is an American reality television series and interactive competition in which a number of aspiring models compete for the title of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; and a chance to begin their career in the modeling industry. Created by Tyra Banks, who also serves as an executive producer, and developed by Ken Mok and Kenya Barris, the series premiered in May 2003, and aired semiannually until 2012, then annually from 2013. The first six seasons (referred to as &quot;cycles&quot;) aired on UPN, before UPN merged with The WB to create The CW in 2006. The following sixteen cycles aired on The CW until the series was first cancelled in October 2015. The series was revived in 2016 and has been airing on VH1 ever since. The series was among the highest-rated programs on UPN and was the highest-rated show on The CW from 2007 to 2010. Advertisers paid $61,315 per 30-second slot during the 2011–12 television season, the highest of any series on The CW. The first 22 cycles of the series and cycle 24 were presented by Banks, while cycle 23 was presented by Rita Ora. The series also employs a panel of two or three additional judges, a creative director and a runway coach.

Cycles 1–16, 19 and 23–24 each consisted of a cast of 10–15 female contestants with no previous participation on the series. Cycle 17&#x27;s cast consisted entirely of previous participants, while cycle 18&#x27;s had seven new contestants and seven former &quot;Britain&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; participants. Cycles 20–22 featured male contestants in the contest, including two male winners. , 24 people have won the competition. Winners typically receive a feature in a magazine and a contract with a modeling agency, among other prizes. The series is the originator of the international &quot;Top Model&quot; franchise. Over fifty versions of the series have been produced internationally.

==Background==

It was announced on January 24, 2006, that &quot;Top Model&quot; would be part of the new The CW network, a merge between UPN and The WB, when the seventh cycle started in September airing on Wednesdays. The series became the first series among regular programming to air on the network. Prior to the announcement of merging with The WB, UPN had committed to renewing the series through its ninth cycle on January 20, 2006, for which casting was conducted throughout mid-2006. &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; was the only show left on the network that was originally from UPN.

On July 21, 2006, the writers of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; went on strike while working on cycle 7, set to premiere on the new CW Network in September 2006. The writers sought representation through the Writers Guild of America, West, which would allow them regulated wages, access to portable health insurance, and pension benefits. These benefits would be similar to those given to writers on scripted shows. The strike was the focus of a large rally of Hollywood writers coinciding with the premiere of the new network on September 20, 2006. The dispute was chronicled in a July 24 interview on the website Television Without Pity with Daniel J. Blau, a former recapper on the site who covered the series, and at the time was an &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; show producer. In November 2006, the writers on strike were taken off payroll.

To celebrate its tenth cycle, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; aired a special installment called &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model: Exposed&quot; in two parts on the CW on Wednesday, February 6 &amp; 13, 2008. It reviewed the best catfights, mishaps and most memorable photo shoots, personalities, defining moments and contained other segments about the show since cycles 1 to 9, and featured a special opening fusing all three openings together. Camille McDonald (cycles 2 and 17), Toccara Jones (cycle 3), Eva Pigford (cycle 3 winner), Bre Scullark (cycles 5 and 17), Cassandra Whitehead (cycle 5), Joanie Dodds (cycle 6), Jael Strauss (cycle 8), Dionne Walters (cycle 8), Heather Kuzmich (cycle 9), and Bianca Golden (cycles 9 and 17) all returned to comment on events that happened in their or other cycles.

After announcing that the seventeenth season would be an All-Stars version, Banks said on The CW upfronts in May 2011, that there would not be a &quot;normal&quot; season of the show anymore. With the start of the eighteenth &quot;British Invasion&quot; cycle, the program converted to high definition, becoming the second-to-last primetime show on the five major English-language broadcast networks in the United States to make the switch, and the last to air in the regular season to do so.

The show is syndicated to NBCUniversal&#x27;s cable division, with Oxygen as well as Style Network carrying the series, usually in marathon form throughout the daytime period on either network, and running through most of or an entire cycle. Bravo, MTV, and VH1 have also aired the series in the past. E! also currently airs reruns of &quot;ANTM&quot;.

==Format==
Each cycle of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; has 9–16 episodes and starts with 10–16 contestants. Contestants are judged weekly on their overall appearance, participation in challenges, and best shot from that week&#x27;s photo shoot; each episode, one contestant is eliminated, though in rare cases a double elimination or no elimination was given by consensus of the judging panel. Makeovers are administered to contestants early in the season (usually after the first or second elimination in the finals) and a trip to an international destination is scheduled about two-thirds of the way through the cycle.

==Judges and other staff members==
The series employs a panel of judges who critique contestants&#x27; progress throughout the competition. Throughout its broadcast, the program has employed seventeen different judges. The original panel consisted of Banks (who also serves as its presenter), Janice Dickinson, Kimora Lee Simmons, and Beau Quillian. Quillian and Simmons were replaced by Nigel Barker and Eric Nicholson in cycle 2, before Nicholson was replaced by Nolé Marin in cycle 3. After cycle 4, Marin and Dickinson were replaced by J. Alexander and Twiggy in cycle 5. Paulina Porizkova joined the panel in cycle 10, in place of Twiggy. After cycle 12, Porizkova was fired by Banks and the panel was left with three judges (Banks, Alexander and Barker) in cycle 13. In cycle 14, Alexander left the panel and was replaced by André Leon Talley, but continued as the series&#x27; runway coach. In cycle 18, Kelly Cutrone replaced Talley. After cycle 18, Banks fired long-standing cast members Barker, Alexander and photo shoot director Jay Manuel. Barker was replaced by Rob Evans in cycle 19, and Manuel by Johnny Wujek. Alexander returned to the panel in cycle 21 in place of Evans. 
For cycle 23 the entire panel, including Banks, was replaced with Rita Ora, Ashley Graham, Drew Elliott and Law Roach while Stacey McKenzie replaced Alexander as runway coach. For the 24th cycle, Banks returned as the main judge and presenter, replacing Ora, while the rest of the personnel remained unchanged.

In the first eighteen cycles, an additional guest judge was welcomed to the panel each week. For the nineteenth and twentieth cycles, public voting was represented on the panel by Bryanboy. For the twenty-first cycle public voting was simply presented on screen doing call-out.

Though not a judge, Jay Manuel served as the creative director during contestants&#x27; photo shoots for the first to eighteenth cycles. During the nineteenth and twentieth cycles, Johnny Wujek replaced Manuel as the creative director of all the shoots, and Yu Tsai replaced Wujek in the twenty-first and twenty-second cycles. Elliot served as both judge and creative director in cycle 23 and 24.

===List of judges and other staff members===
==Series overview==

Los Angeles has been the primary filming location of most of the seasons. The first three seasons of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; were filmed in New York City, along with seasons 10, 12 and 14; the latter three seasons were altered due to Banks&#x27;s duties in &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot;, and 23.

;Notes
==Partnerships==
&quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; was also connected with Banks&#x27; talk show, on which several contestants have appeared, most notably Natasha Galkina (cycle 8), who worked as a correspondent for the show. The show&#x27;s stage was also used for the cycle 5 reunion show.

In 2008, Banks launched a new reality show inside the &quot;Tyra Show&quot;, called &quot;Modelville&quot; which featured past contestants Renee DeWitt (cycle 8), Bianca Golden (cycle 9), Dominique Reighard, Fatima Siad and Lauren Utter (all cycle 10) vying for a $50,000 contract with Carol&#x27;s Daughter. The competition was ultimately won by Reighard.

The &quot;ANTM&quot; franchise released a clothing and accessories line based on the television show, which is sold at most Walmart stores. It ranges from cosmetic products to handbags.

===Video game===
A video game loosely based on the series, also titled &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, was released for the Nintendo DS and Wii on June 1, 2010. The game involves players playing as a model participating in a televised modeling competition while living in a mansion with the other models, though it does not feature any cast members from the television series, including Banks. It features customization options for hair, makeup, and clothing, and also allows players to engage in catfights with other models. For Common Sense Media, Christopher Healy gave the game three out of five stars, writing that it &quot;does have a number of flaws&quot; but that &quot;one thing this game does very well... is replicate the feeling of being on a reality show&quot;.

===America&#x27;s Next Top Model Dolls===

The America&#x27;s Next Top Model Dolls were a short-lived fashion doll line released by MGA Entertainment as a promotional tie-in with the show of the same name. The dolls were designed by MGA doll designer Lui Domingo and released in the fall of 2008.

The dolls came as a result of the legal battle between Mattel and MGA over their fashion doll rivalry between Barbie and Bratz. When MGA temporarily lost the rights to the Bratz dolls to Mattel, the company scrambled to come up with an emergency release line to replace Bratz in the meantime. The America&#x27;s Next Top Model Dolls were the result, as a form of competition with Mattel&#x27;s Top Model Barbie line that was released a year prior, but had no affiliation with this show. The concept art, sketches, and prototypes initially revealed 4 main characters, Sienna (a blonde-haired, blue-eyed Caucasian), Sydney (a brunette Asian), Paisley (a red-haired Caucasian), and Tascha (an African American). The Tascha prototype would not make it to production (but still be featured in all of the marketing), due to MGA&#x27;s fears that the doll, being African American, would sell poorly, as black dolls have historically been known to be picked up in low quantities or not picked at all by stores and retailers if they believed they would not sell, especially if they&#x27;re located in cities with a low black population. Resulting from the financial losses incurred from their legal battle with Mattel, the dolls would ultimately not feature the majority of the accessories that were advertised with them, likely a cost-cutting measure (which is also why Tascha was excluded from the doll line).

Only two waves would be released, Swimwear and Day-to-Night wear, all featuring only Sienna, Sydney, and Paisley. Four fashion packs were also released for the dolls, each featuring images of the four characters, including the never produced Tascha doll. The box for the dolls also made it clear under the logo that they were the only officially licensed dolls from the hit TV show, to differentiate them from Mattel&#x27;s Top Model Barbie line. The boxes also featured before and after images of the dolls, in reference to the makeovers on the show, and the back of the box also included a backstory for each doll to show that they had multi-faceted personalities and dream careers besides modeling, to counter the accusations that the dolls would be poor role models for children. The dolls had proportions different to that of other MGA fashion dolls, with slightly smaller heads and more Barbie-esque bodies, with jointed torsos for posing and arms molded to be able to rest on their hips. The dolls also noticeably used leftovers from the Bratz line as part of their accessories, as the clothes were stitched from leftover Bratz clothing fabric, and the jewelry was simply repurposed from prior Bratz dolls.

The dolls were a financial failure, selling very poorly in spite of their association with the show (which had been declining in ratings by the time the dolls debuted), and were promptly discontinued after only two waves of dolls.

==Reception==
===Impact in pop culture===
The show has been referred to in many series, such as ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;GREEK&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot;, and Fox&#x27;s &quot;Family Guy&quot;. It also had its own &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot; episode, featuring past contestants Ebony Haith, Giselle Samson, Elyse Sewell (all cycle 1), Adrianne Curry (cycle 1 winner), Camille McDonald (cycles 2 &amp; 17), April Wilkner, Mercedes Scelba-Shorte (both cycle 2), Toccara Jones, Ann Markley, Amanda Swafford (all cycle 3), Eva Pigford (cycle 3 winner), Michelle Deighton (cycle 4), Brittany Brower (cycles 4 &amp; 17), Naima Mora (cycle 4 winner), Ebony Taylor (cycle 5), Lisa D&#x27;Amato (cycle 5 &amp; cycle 17 winner), Kim Stolz (cycle 5) and Bre Scullark (cycles 5 &amp; 17) as well as judges &amp; personals Janice Dickinson, Tyra Banks, Nigel Barker, J. Alexander, Jay Manuel, Ken Mok and Michelle Mock-Falcon. It covered the first five cycles and recently re-aired with a few added minutes of footage which cover cycles 6 to 10 and &quot;Stylista&quot;.

In 2009, Oxygen Network aired a series based on the show called &quot;Top Model Obsessed&quot;, featuring past contestants Lisa D&#x27;Amato (cycle 5 &amp; cycle 17 winner), CariDee English (cycle 7 winner) and Bianca Golden (cycles 9 &amp; 17).

Many credit &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; for inspiring later reality television shows, most notably &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot;. Kevin O&#x27;Keefe and Mathew Rodriguez noted that &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; served as &quot;the biggest inspiration&quot; for the show and that season 1 of &quot;RuPaul&#x27;s Drag Race&quot; was &quot;a parody of a couple different reality shows ... but more so (of) &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;. They explain that &quot;Top Model&quot; was a groundbreaking reality show&quot; and that &quot;it crawled so that &quot;Drag Race&quot; could walk&quot;. They drew parallels between Tyra Banks and RuPaul as black people &quot;who (have) been at the top of their field&quot; and &quot;play a persona&quot; on their respective shows. They also compared the judging panels, comparing Michelle Visage to Nigel Barker as an &quot;anchor main judge&quot; who is &quot;harsher in their critiques&quot;, although contrasted RuPaul&#x27;s judges with Tyra&#x27;s, stating that &quot;RuPaul has never allowed a drag queen to sit on the panel the way Tyra would bring in either Janice Dickinson then Twiggy.&quot; Moreover, the &quot;first mini challenge of the first several seasons of &quot;Drag Race&quot; used to always be a photoshoot&quot; and season 6&#x27;s photoshoot of jumping off a platform was &quot;directly taken from a photoshoot in season 6 of &quot;ANTM&quot;, where they had to play fairy tale characters and jump&quot; off a platform. Another &quot;artefact&quot; of Top Model&#x27;s influence on the show comes from &quot;Drag Race&quot;&#x27;s focus on runway, with season 8 contestant Kim Chi being &quot;criticised for not having a model walk&quot;. Most importantly, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; &quot;was one of the most queer shows on TV&quot; with regard to the inclusion of Jay Manuel, J. Alexander and Benny Ninja on the judging panel and numerous openly LGBTQ+ contestants, most notably Isis King. It was &quot;covertly queer enough to make the space on TV for something as queer as &quot;Drag Race&quot;.&quot;

===U.S. television ratings===
For the 2006–2009 and 2010–2011 television seasons, &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; was the No.1 show in average viewers on The CW.

:&quot;Each U.S. network television season starts in late September and ends in late May, which coincides with the completion of May sweeps.&quot;

;Notes
===Criticism===
Yahoo!&#x27;s Shine lifestyle website said the show contained cruelty and elements of humiliation, and that some critiques from the judges are &quot;really cruel and cringe-inducing&quot;, claiming that the show &quot;humiliates and degrades young women.&quot; The site created the list &quot;10 reasons why &#x27;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&#x27; is bad for women, humans&quot;, citing such things as giving the contestants and women viewers unrealistic visions of life as a model, and &quot;always espousing empowerment and female strength and then forcing the contestants into embarrassing scenarios far outside the realm of real-life modeling&quot;. One such scenario highlighted was when cycle 12&#x27;s final two contestants &quot;were made to wear bikinis so skimpy that the producers had to blur out Allison Harvard&#x27;s butt cheeks&quot;, and performed a &quot;creepily sexual mud fight,&quot; after which contestant and winner Teyona Anderson was &quot;commended for taking her weave in her hand and whipping it around on the runway like a sexy feather boa.&quot;

&quot;Allure&quot; magazine criticized the show in its October 2006 issue, saying that &quot;ANTM&quot; &quot;hasn&#x27;t exactly produced any actual supermodels.&quot;

Ken Mok and Banks noticed that most of cycle 8&#x27;s girls were unusually heavy smokers. &quot;Tyra and I understand the influence &#x27;Top Model&#x27; has on a generation of young people, and we want to make sure we get the right message to our audience,&quot; Mok said, which then prompted the &quot;green&quot; theme of cycle 9.

The winner of cycle 9, Saleisha Stowers, was discovered to have been in a Wendy&#x27;s commercial, on a catwalk in the cycle 6 show and an episode of Tyra Banks Show prior to her participation. The rules of the competition stated that a contestant must not have appeared as a model in a national campaign during the five years prior to the production of the cycle in which they participate. The CW network said she had revealed her role in the Wendy&#x27;s commercial, and &quot;after reviewing the commercial, it was determined that her appearance did not amount to &#x27;modeling&#x27; experience, and therefore did not exclude her from participating in the show.&quot;

After filming cycle 10, the producers of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; were served with a lawsuit from Michael Marvisi, the owner of the loft used as the Top Model house. The lawsuit claimed that the contestants as well as the production crew caused an estimated $500,000 in damages to the loft. Marvisi claims the contestants engaged in food fights, made holes in the walls, caused water damage to the bathroom, damaged a $15,000 chandelier beyond repair, and caused $90,000 worth of damage to an electrical store. Also, the production crew was accused of damaging the flooring and making holes in the ceiling for lighting equipment.

==Broadcast history==

===International broadcasts===
&quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot; is currently shown on TV internationally in 170 countries and regions, namely: Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and the whole of Southeast Asia (except Timor-Leste). The following table shows countries and regions that have aired this show:

The channels in bold also broadcast their own version of &quot;Top Model&quot;.

The international versions of Top Model have generally been better received by critics. In an article for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, Adrienne Raphel explained that &quot;Oddly enough, it&#x27;s the foreign &quot;Top Model&quot; spinoffs that are in the more direct business of producing working models, like Ksenia Kahtovitch and Alice Burdeu, not the beautytainment ... queens of ANTM.&quot;

&quot;Slate&quot; Torie Bosch points out that the international versions &quot;have retained what works best about &quot;ANTM&quot;—the in-house drama, the torturous makeovers, the ridiculous assignments—while skipping what&#x27;s worst about it: hokey judge antics, outlandish veneration of Tyra, and sob-story contestants.&quot;

===Spin-off===

In October 2008, The CW announced that it had ordered a spin-off pilot of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, titled &quot;Operation Fabulous&quot;. The proposed show would have starred &quot;ANTM&quot; creative director Jay Manuel and runway coach Mrs. J. Alexander as they travel the country to provide makeovers to everyday women. Tyra Banks and Ken Mok would have served as executive producers for the new show. However, The CW ultimately declined to pick up the show.

==Distribution==
Until 2012, only cycle 1 had been released domestically on DVD. This is because the home video license was formerly held by UPN, and was distributed for them by Paramount Home Entertainment. Since the series is now independently produced, the video rights to the remaining cycles have, until recently, been open for acquisition (and therefore, the remaining seasons had yet to be issued on DVD or Blu-ray). However, on May 30, it was announced on the CW that cycles 2 and 3 were available to pre-order on DVD via new licensee CBS Home Entertainment. They are now available for purchase on Amazon.com. Additionally, cycles 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 were also made into DVDs and sold on the website.

==Sponsors==
For cycle 1, Revlon sponsored this show with the products and prizes. For cycle 2, Sephora replaced Revlon as the commercial sponsor. Through cycles 3–18, CoverGirl replaced Sephora as the continuation on products and prizes. For cycle 19, shoe retailer Nine West and Smashbox sponsored with campaigns, but the cosmetics sponsorship has ended. For cycle 20, Guess sponsored with a US$100,000 ad campaign for the winner.

==Contestants&#x27; crossover appearances==
* In cycle 3, Taye Diggs from &quot;Kevin Hill&quot; appeared in the acting challenge. While Yaya DaCosta won the challenge, it was cycle 3 winner Eva Pigford who guest-starred on the show. She later starred on other UPN/CW shows such as &quot;Smallville&quot;.
* Naima Mora (winner of cycle 4), Kim Stolz (cycle 5), and Furonda Brasfield (cycle 6) were given guest-starring roles on episodes of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. Kim and Furonda&#x27;s roles were cameos in the same series.
* CariDee English (cycle 7 winner), who won the acting challenge in Episode 9, guest-starred in an episode of &quot;One Tree Hill,&quot; and later had a cameo appearance in an episode of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;. English hosted Oxygen reality TV series &quot;Pretty Wicked&quot;.
* For cycle 8, the acting-themed episode had Tia Mowry of CW&#x27;s &quot;The Game&quot; give the girls a crash course in acting, although the &quot;crossover&quot; was limited to Mowry&#x27;s appearance, as the challenge winner was not given a guest role as a prize. Instead, Renee DeWitt, who won the challenge, got a surprise visit from her husband and son which she shared with Dionne Walters, whose family also showed up for a surprise visit.

==Future==
Since the conclusion of cycle 24, there has been speculation about the show&#x27;s renewal for a 25th season. By May 2019, a year after cycle 24&#x27;s conclusion, VH1 had still not announced any news about a renewal or a cancellation. Tyra Banks has expressed interest in a 25th cycle: &quot;You know, we&#x27;ve done [24] cycles of &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;, and I feel that we should at least end at 25.&quot; Multiple interviews with Banks have indicated that a new cycle was in the planning stages, but there have been no official announcements.

<text>Free Kitten is an American alternative rock band formed by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon and Pussy Galore&#x27;s Julia Cafritz. Originally performing as Kitten, they changed their name after receiving threats of legal action by a heavy metal singer performing under the same name. Boredoms member Yoshimi P-We took up drums, and Pavement&#x27;s Mark Ibold joined later on as bassist. They have released a handful of albums and singles, mainly on label Kill Rock Stars, including a remix 12-inch featuring DJ Spooky. They toured on 1993&#x27;s Lollapalooza. A studio album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;Inherit&quot;, on Thurston Moore&#x27;s Ecstatic Peace! label, is the group&#x27;s most recently available.

<text>Charles Tomlinson Griffes ( ; September 17, 1884 – April 8, 1920) was an American composer for piano, chamber ensembles and voice. His initial works are influenced by German Romanticism, but after he relinquished the German style, his later works make him the most famous American representative of musical Impressionism, along with Charles Martin Loeffler. He was fascinated by the exotic, mysterious sound of the French Impressionists, and was compositionally much influenced by them while he was in Europe. He also studied the work of contemporary Russian composers such as Scriabin, whose influence is also apparent in his use of synthetic scales.

==Musical career==
Griffes was born in Elmira, New York. He had early piano lessons with his sister Katherine and later studied piano with Mary Selena Broughton, who taught at Elmira College. Broughton had a profound impact on his personal and musical development. After early studies on piano and organ in his home town, on recommendation of Broughton, he went to Berlin to study with pianist Ernst Jedliczka and Gottfried Galston at the Stern Conservatory. Although recognised as a performer, Griffes grew more interested in composition. Despite being advised against it by Broughton, he left the conservatory and was briefly taught by composer Engelbert Humperdinck. During his time in Berlin he composed several German songs and the for orchestra.

On returning to the U.S. in 1907, he became director of music studies at the Hackley School for boys in Tarrytown, New York, a post which he held until his early death thirteen years later. His post has been described as &quot;grim and unrewarding&quot;, though it gave him financial stability. He continued to compose at Hackley in his free time and promoted his music during the summer.

His most famous works are the &quot;White Peacock&quot;, for piano (1915, orchestrated in 1919); his Piano Sonata (1917–18, revised 1919); a tone poem, &quot;The Pleasure Dome of Kubla Khan&quot;, after the fragment by Coleridge (1912, revised in 1916), and &quot;Poem for Flute and Orchestra&quot; (1918). He also wrote numerous programmatic pieces for piano, chamber ensembles, and for voice. The amount and quality of his music is impressive considering his short life and his full-time teaching job, and much of his music is still performed. His unpublished &quot;Sho-jo&quot; (1917), a one-act pantomimic drama based on Japanese themes, is one of the earliest works by an American composer to show direct inspiration from the music of Japan.

==Personal life==

Griffes died of influenza in New York City during the 1918 worldwide Spanish flu pandemic at the age of 35 and is buried in Bloomfield Cemetery in Bloomfield, New Jersey. His papers passed to his younger sister Marguerite, who chose to destroy many that explicitly related to his life as a homosexual. Donna Anderson (1935–2018) was his literary executor. Griffes kept meticulous diaries, some in German, which chronicled his musical accomplishments from 1907 to 1919, and also dealt honestly with his homosexuality, including his regular patronage of the gay bathhouses at Lafayette Place and the Produce Exchange.
During his time as a student in Berlin, he was devoted to his &quot;special friend&quot; Emil Joèl (aka &quot;Konrad Wölcke&quot;). In later life, he had a long-term relationship with John Meyer (biographer Edward Maisel used the pseudonym Dan C. Martin), a married New York policeman.

<doc id="621072" wikidata="Q653246" url="?curid=621072" title="Black-hooded oriole">
<text>The black-hooded oriole (Oriolus xanthornus) is a member of the oriole family of passerine birds and is a resident breeder in tropical southern Asia from India and Sri Lanka east to Indonesia.

It is a bird of open woodland and cultivation. The nest is built in a tree, and contains two eggs. Its food is insects and fruit, especially figs, found in the tree canopies where they spend much of their time.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The black-hooded oriole was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Coracias xanthornus&quot;. Linnaeus was confused by the similar appearance of the unrelated New World orioles and the Old World orioles. In his entry for &quot;Coracias xanthornus&quot; he cited descriptions of birds occurring in Jamaica by Mark Catesby and Patrick Browne as well as an illustration by George Edwards of a bird occurring in Bengal. Linnaeus specified the habitat as &quot;America&quot; but Bengal is now the recognised type location. Also in the 10th edition Linnaeus listed &quot;Sturnus luteolus&quot; among the starlings and cited another illustration by Edwards. He renamed this species as &quot;Oriolus melanocephalus&quot; in the 12th edition of 1766. All three binomial names are now believed to refer to the black-hooded oriole.

The current genus &quot;Oriolus&quot; was erected by Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The name is from Medieval Latin &quot;oryolus&quot; for the Eurasian golden oriole which in turn comes from the Latin word &quot;aureolus&quot; for &quot;golden&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;xanthornus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;xanthos&quot; &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;ornis&quot; &quot;bird&quot;.

Alternate names for the black-hooded oriole include the Asian black-headed oriole, black-headed oriole, Indian black-headed oriole and Oriental black-headed oriole.

===Subspecies===
Five subspecies are recognized: 
* &quot;O. x. xanthornus&quot; – : Found from northern India to northern Malay Peninsula and Indochina
* &quot;O. x. maderaspatanus&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species. Found in central and southern India
* &quot;O. x. ceylonensis&quot; – : Originally described as a separate species. Found in Sri Lanka
* &quot;O. x. reubeni&quot; – : Found on the Andaman Islands
* &quot;O. x. tanakae&quot; – : Found on north-eastern Borneo
==Description==

The male is striking, with the typical oriole black and yellow colouration. The plumage is predominantly yellow, with a solid black hood, and black also in the wings and tail centre.

The female black-hooded oriole is a drabber bird with greenish underparts, but still has the black hood. Young birds are like the female, but have dark streaking on the underparts, and their hood is not solidly black, especially on the throat.

The black head of this species is an obvious distinction from the Indian golden oriole, which is a summer visitor to northern India. Orioles can be shy, and even the male may be difficult to see in the dappled yellow and green leaves of the canopy.

The black-hooded oriole&#x27;s flight is somewhat like a thrush, strong and direct with some shallow dips over longer distances.

While foraging the species uses foliage-gleening, wood-gleening, or sallying methods.

== Relationship to humans ==
The black-hooded oriole lives in common contact with humans in rural and urban India.

A folk tale from Bengal has it that an unfortunate girl of a merchant family was abused and tortured by her mother-in-law. Troubled by various incidents she smeared herself with turmeric paste and covered herself with a sooty earthen pot and killed herself. A goddess resurrected her as a black hooded oriole and a Bengali name for the bird is &quot;benebou&quot; or merchant&#x27;s wife while another name is &quot;haldi pakhi&quot; or turmeric bird.

The show was taped in front of a live audience, with the players sitting on a tiered set (one team on top and the other on the bottom). The &quot;SmartAsk&quot; tournament was described by Ralph Benmergui, the show&#x27;s executive producer, on TSN&#x27;s &quot;Off The Record&quot; as being &quot;&quot;Reach for the Top&quot; on acid,&quot; although in practice this largely involved crude humour, especially as the show went on and ratings sagged.

==On-air personalities==
The show was hosted in its first season by Justin Landry and rapper Michie Mee. Brothers Nobu and Mio Adilman replaced Landry for the second season, and Sabrina Jalees replaced Michie for the final season.

During the show&#x27;s first two seasons, &quot;Judge Lucci&quot; (Luciano Casimiri) had a semi-recurring role as the show&#x27;s on-air judge. The show also brought in numerous celebrity judges&quot; for Season 2 including such celebrities as Colin Mochrie from &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway&quot;, Olympic gold medalist Sami Jo Small, MLB star Chris Woodward, environmentalist David Suzuki, and German folk singer Heino. The judging panel was moved off-camera in Season 3, with the title of &quot;Celebrity Judge&quot; given to a random audience member for each episode.

&quot;Superfan&quot; Andy Saunders also made guest appearances during the show&#x27;s second and final seasons, to give analysis, predictions, and statistics. Saunders also handed out &quot;Andy Awards&quot; to the show&#x27;s top players and funnier moments.

==How to get on SmartAsk!==
Schools wishing to compete for the championship first submitted a written, audio or video entry to the CBC on a topic announced on the CBC&#x27;s &quot;SmartAsk&quot; page. A major grievance against the selection process, however, was the subjectivity of evaluation of entries, with no clear criteria for judging. Nevertheless, 124 schools were chosen from these entries from across the nation (the defending champion received an automatic berth into the next season). 122 of these 125 schools then competed with another school in their province or region on CBC Radio for a berth in the television round. The 3 teams chosen from the territories received a bye into the television round. Teams then competed in a 64-team single-elimination tournament, culminating in the championships. The championship games were not taped until all of the first 60 games, to determine the four teams in the championships, had been aired. Schools fielded teams of up to 4 players for the competition, 3 players playing on-air, and up to 1 alternate.

==Game formats==
SmartAsk had 4 different formats: one for the radio games, and one for TV in each season. The Adilman brothers were infamous for getting the rules to their own show wrong, often to inadvertent comic effect.

===Radio show===
The first stage of SmartAsk after team&#x27;s entries were accepted was qualifying for television through a game played on CBC Radio. These games aired every Friday from late September to mid-November of the school year in which the season took place. The games were generally 15 minutes in length. There were three rounds to the game in each season: the 10 point round, the 20 point round and the Lightning Round.

In the 10 and 20 point rounds, players had to wait until the host had finished the reading the question to buzz in. This rule was known as the &quot;no preemptive buzzing&quot; (NPB) rule. In the radio show, teams buzzing in early forfeited their right to answer the question. The questions were given in categories of 3 or 4 questions, such as science or spelling, with the last 20 point category being a viewer-submitted questions category, which was general knowledge. There was no penalty for an incorrect response in these rounds, and if the first team to buzz answered incorrectly, their opponents could then buzz in and provide an answer. These rounds were shortened each season to increase the importance of the Lightning Round. Before the 20 point round started, the host conducted brief interviews with the team captains.

In the Lightning Round, all questions were worth 30 points and could be on any topic. Players could buzz in at any time, making it much like Reach for the Top. However, only one answer was accepted from all players, and incorrect answers were penalized 30 points. Many radio hosts forgot that &quot;steals&quot; (answering a question, hopefully correctly, after the opposing team has answered incorrectly) were not allowed in the Lightning Round. Each year, the Lightning Round on radio was 90 seconds long. Generally, hosts got through anywhere from 7 to 13 questions in that time. Even though the Lightning Round itself was not made longer, the fact that the earlier rounds were shortened increased the Lightning Round&#x27;s importance in determining the final result.

In Alberta, the Lightning Round was played differently. Each team received 30 seconds in which to answer questions. Teams could choose to pass on a question by indicating that they wished to pass. Otherwise, the questions were still worth 30 points for a correct answer and -30 points for an incorrect answer.

Teams that won their radio game proceeded to compete in the television rounds. The tapings for the TV rounds were done in November and December in the last two seasons. Various strikes in 2002 caused some of the tapings for the first season to be delayed until February 2002.

===Season 1===
In the first season, there were four rounds: the 20 point round, the 50 point round, the 100 point round and the Lightning Round. The first three rounds were NPB rounds.

In the first three rounds, play was as in the radio NPB rounds. However, on TV, there was a lockout system: if a team buzzed in before the question was finished that team could not buzz in for approximately 1.5 seconds. The questions increased in difficulty with each round. Each round had 3 categories, and each category had about 4 or 5 questions, but some had 3 or 6. The categories were often given humorous names which had some connection to the content of that category.

In the Lightning Round, each question was worth 50 points, with 50 points deducted for an incorrect response. Lightning Round length varied wildly in Season 1, with an average range being 8 to 18 questions. Unlike in later seasons, teams were not given the amount of time for the Lightning Round.

Player interviews were conducted at two different points in the game throughout the season. Players (one from each team) were either interviewed prior to the 100-point round or prior to the Lightning Round. Contestants stayed in their seats for the interviews.

Generally, winning teams scored at least 1000 points. In 4 games, both teams scored at least 1000 points. In their first round game, Victoria School scored 2,120 points.

The winners of Season 1, Kennebecasis Valley High School, would continue their solid play into Seasons 2 and 3. By the end of the series&#x27; run, KVHS had the best overall record with 14 wins and 2 losses.

===Season 2===
The second season&#x27;s format was probably the most unconventional SmartAsk had during its 3-year run. In the second season, the rounds were the 20 point round, the 50 point round, Dawg Eat Dawg, the Dirty Half Dozen and the Lightning Round.

The 20 and 50 point rounds were NPB rounds. In the 20 point round, there were 2 categories of 3-4 questions each, a video question, and then another category of 3-4 questions. The last category was given by host Mio Adilman, who came out from backstage in a rather embarrassing costume. He came out in a Speedo numerous times; this is generally agreed to be his most embarrassing costume. Other embarrassing costumes from the second season were Mio as a cheerleader, Mio as Mia and &quot;Mio of Green Gables&quot;. The 50 point round, however had 2 categories of 3-4 questions each. Several category names were based on a pun.

The Dawg Eat Dawg round was particularly unusual. It was similar to Final Jeopardy from the popular game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;, only that teams bet on members of the opposing team. The teams were given a general category, such as science or sports. Teams then chose a member of the opposing team and placed a bet. The bet had to be a positive integer and a multiple of ten. The chosen players then were given a question. They had five seconds to write down their answer on their chalkboard, and then show it. If the player was incorrect, the opposing team received points equal to their bet. If the player was correct, the opposing team lost points equal to their bet. Some teams, notably semi-finalist Three Hills School bet many points in this round, after scoring them in the NPB rounds. Other teams did not, notably champion Merivale High School, who only ever bet 10 points in the Dawg Eat Dawg round. The Dawg Eat Dawg question was often the hardest question in the game.

The Dirty Half Dozen was the replacement for Season 1&#x27;s 100 point round. Each of the six players received a question to themselves. If they answered it correctly, their team received 100 points. If they were incorrect, their counterpart on the opposing team (either above or below them) got a chance to steal the question for 50 points; as such, it was possible for a player to earn 150 points during the round. After the Dawg question, Dirty Half Dozen questions were the next hardest in the game.

The Lightning Round format didn&#x27;t change from Season 1. It was, however, lengthened, although there was one game where only 6 questions were asked. Contestants were told the time for the Lightning Round, however, unless they measured it themselves, they could not tell how much time was left in the round. In the final game, the Lightning Round was three minutes long, the longest of the season. Lightning Round times ranged from about 1:00 to 2:00, with anywhere from 10 to 20 questions being asked in a typical round.

Interviews of one player from each team were conducted before the 50 point round. Both contestants being interviewed went onto the floor, in between the player set and host table. As there were two hosts, the players were interviewed one after another.

Generally, winning teams scored 600 to 800 points. Because of the elimination of the open 100 point round and the difficulty of the Dirty Half Dozen questions, teams rarely broke 1000 points. Only three teams did so: St. George&#x27;s School scored 1,250 points in their first round game, Saint John High School scored 1,120 points in their third round game and Saint Malachy&#x27;s Memorial High School scored 1,060 points in their second round game.

===Season 3===
The third season format saw an end to the Dawg Eat Dawg round and further importance for the Lightning Round. The rounds became the 20 point round, the 50 point round, Smart and Smarterer (meant as a play on &quot;Dumb and Dumberer&quot;, which was released in mid-June 2003), the Dirty Half Dozen and the Lightning Round.

The 20 and 50 point rounds worked as they did in the second season. The video question was renamed &quot;Nobu Nation&quot; after host Nobu Adilman. Mio&#x27;s Moment still existed, but Mio&#x27;s costumes were considered to be not as embarrassing as the by-then infamous Speedo. Some of the worst of the season were Mio in a tutu (he also wore the pink spandex for the rest of the game, which led to a fair deal of banter before the Dirty Half Dozen) and Mio as an armpit hair model.

Smart and Smarterer was a new round, and was moderated by the new host, Sabrina Jalees. The teams were given a category or theme, such as &quot;Capitalize on That!&quot; (political geography) or &quot;Black and White&quot; (general knowledge having to do with the colours black and white). The teams then chose their best player for the topic, and those players went to a special podium, situated where the interviews took place in Season Two. Once there, the two faced off in a 45-second Lightning Round, with each question being worth 50 points, or -50 for an incorrect answer.

The Dirty Half Dozen remained unchanged in format from the second season. The question difficulty was decreased compared to the second season, although it was in this round that differences in question difficulty from earlier rounds to later rounds were most often noticed.

The Lightning Round received an overhaul in Season Three. It was extended, with the average range being from 2:00 to 3:00. It was also divided into two consecutive halves. In the first half, questions were worth 50 points, with, as usual, 50 points being deducted for incorrect answers. In the second half, question value doubled to 100 points, with the incorrect answer penalty being a 100-point deduction. Generally, 10-15 questions were asked in each half of the Lightning Round. Teams were told the amount of time for the round, and they were told during the round when the question values doubled. In the last three games, the time was displayed on the monitor facing the players (which showed the player set so that all players knew the game score at any time).

Interviews were, as in Season 2, conducted before the 50 point round. However, since the interview space from Season Two was being used for the Smart and Smarterer podium, the interviews were conducted on the floor of the set, in front of the player set.

Generally, winning teams scored at least 1000 points. In 9 games, both teams scored at least 1000 points. In their first round game, Central Secondary School from London, Ontario scored 2,140 points, breaking the record set by Victoria School in Season 1. Also, the Bishop&#x27;s College School-Fredericton High School third round game went to a 3-question overtime, the only time in all three seasons that this occurred. &quot;SmartAsk&quot; history was also made in the Templeton Secondary School-Archbishop M.C. O&#x27;Neill High School first round game, when O&#x27;Neill became the only team in the program&#x27;s run to finish a televised game with a negative total, ending up with -120 points.

<doc id="621077" wikidata="Q837893" url="?curid=621077" title="T&amp;T Supermarket">
<text>T&amp;T Supermarket () is a Canadian Asian supermarket chain founded in Vancouver in 1993 by Jack and Cindy Lee who was the founding CEO. Cindy&#x27;s eldest daughter Tina Lee succeeded her mother in 2014. In 2009, T&amp;T Supermarket was acquired by Loblaw Companies Limited. 

T&amp;T Supermarket has 37 locations in Canada, and one location in the United States. The stores range in size from to . In addition to the many departments found in a regular supermarket, most T&amp;T stores also feature produce, meat, seafood, baked goods, kitchenware, gifts, specialty items from various Asian cuisines, hot food bar, dim sum counter, sushi counter and Hong Kong style Chinese barbecue. In 2020, they launched an online shopping platform and an app.

&quot;T&amp;T&quot; is a reference to the initials of two founding investing managing corporations, Tawa Supermarket Inc. and Tung Yee Uni-President Enterprises Corp., though a popular story circulates that it refers to Cindy Lee&#x27;s eldest daughters, Tina and Tiffany.

==History==
===Establishment and early history===
Taiwanese-Canadian businesswoman Cindy Lee started the business with a store located in Burnaby, British Columbia in 1993.

On March 5, 2007, &quot;The Tyee&quot; reported a case of a foreign temporary worker who claimed to have been exploited, and had his passport seized by T&amp;T Supermarket. According to The Tyee&#x27;s coverage, &quot;In a notice of claim filed with the small claims division of the Provincial Court of British Columbia, Gui Qiang Zou claims he was pressured into working longer hours for lower wages than promised after the firm kept his passport and other key documents.&quot;

===Acquisition by Loblaw===
T&amp;T is part of Loblaw Companies, which purchased it in July 2009 for $225 million in consideration, consisting of $191 million in cash and $34 million in preferred shares. The consideration paid above and beyond the tangible asset base of the company (i.e. the accounting goodwill) which was estimated at $180 million.

===Unionization history===
In 2012, &quot;Huff Post Business Canada&quot; reported that workers at a T&amp;T Supermarket warehouse in Scarborough, Ontario, would head to a secret ballot vote on Monday, July 23, 2012, for unionization. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) filed an application for certification with the Ontario Labour Relations Board on July 16, 2012. According to UFCW national representative Kevin Shimmin, the workers at the T&amp;T Supermarket Scarborough warehouse, are seeking unionization to attempt improving scheduling issues as well as tying wage more closely to seniority, instead of favouritism. Shimmin gave in the article an example that Warehouse staff at T&amp;T Supermarket worked a 39-hour work week, spanning six days in a week. He also said that there were cases where staff working for T&amp;T Supermarket for three years were still earning a minimum wage of $10.25 per hour. Paul Ho, marketing manager for the grocery chain in Ontario, said he did not have details about wages, but maintained that work hours &quot;var[ied] from individual to individual, and depends on the production schedule.&quot; On July 23, about 100 employees at the T&amp;T Scarborough warehouse voted partcipated in the secret ballot unionization vote. However, the Ontario Labour Relations Board sealed the ballot box for review. A dispute arose as the UFCW and T&amp;T Supermarket argued about the eligibility of the voters in the voter list. UFCW national representative Kevin Shimmin said that the dispute caused the secret ballot vote to be reviewed, while T&amp;T CEO Cindy Lee claimed that it was the decision of the Ontario Labour Relations Board to look into whether the union has enough support from employees to in the first place file the application.
===Development of largest T&amp;T store and e-commerce platform===
In 2018, T&amp;T opened a 70,000 sq. ft. flagship store in Richmond, British Columbia, which was the first to have a live seafood bar, an Asian street food station, and self-checkouts. Industry experts dubbed the store a &quot;grocerant&quot; because of its restaurant-style offering.

In 2020, T&amp;T launched its e-commerce platform, facilitating online orders and delivery of Asian food products across all provinces in Canada.
In 2022, an even larger store was opened in Saint-Laurent/Sainte Croix, Montreal, Quebec. It was the first T&amp;T store to open in Quebec and is currently the largest store in the supermarket chain.

===Expansion into United States===
In 2024, T&amp;T Supermarket opened its first American location at Marketplace at Factoria in Bellevue, Washington. The outlet, spanning square feet, claims to be the largest grocery store in the state. Other locations in Lynnwood, Washington, and San Jose, California, are scheduled to open in 2025.

==Awards==
In 2018, CEO Tina Lee received the Executive of the Year Award by Ascend Canada and, together with founder Cindy Lee, were awarded with the Retail Council of Canada Canadian Grand Prix Trailblazer Lifetime Achievement Award for having &quot;demonstrated outstanding service and dedication to the Canadian retail and grocery industry.&quot; Cindy Lee received the lifetime achievement award at the 2019 Chinese Canadian entrepreneur awards in recognition of her contributions to the Chinese Canadian business community.

<text>A photophore is a glandular organ that appears as luminous spots on marine animals, including fish and cephalopods. The organ can be simple, or as complex as the human eye, equipped with lenses, shutters, color filters, and reflectors; unlike an eye, however, it is optimized to produce light, not absorb it.

==Mechanism==
The bioluminescence can be produced from compounds during the digestion of prey, from specialized mitochondrial cells in the organism called photocytes (&quot;light producing&quot; cells), or, similarly, associated with symbiotic bacteria in the organism that are cultured.

The character of photophores is important in the identification of deep sea fishes. Photophores on fish are used for attracting food or for camouflage from predators by counter-illumination.

Photophores are found on some cephalopods including the firefly squid, which can create impressive light displays, as well as numerous other deep sea organisms, such as the pocket shark &quot;Mollisquama mississippiensis&quot; and the strawberry squid.

<doc id="621092" wikidata="Q1393314" url="?curid=621092" title="Fairlight (group)">
<text>FairLight (FLT) is a warez and demo group initially involved in the Commodore demoscene, and in cracking to illegally release games for free, since 1987. In addition to the C64, FairLight has also migrated towards the Amiga, Super NES and later the PC. FairLight was founded during the Easter holiday in 1987 by Strider and Black Shadow, both ex-members of West Coast Crackers (WCC). This &quot;West Coast&quot; was the west coast of Sweden, so FairLight was initially a Swedish group, which later became internationalized. The name was taken from the Fairlight CMI synthesizer which Strider saw Jean-Michel Jarre use on some of his records.

== Beginning ==
FairLight became known for their fast cracks. The secret was that Strider worked in a computer store where he got the latest games. He then bribed a train conductor to transport the games from Malmö to Ronneby where Gollum cracked the game and sent it back in the same way. That way they could get releases out faster than other groups.

==Operation Fastlink==
Several high-ranking members of the group were caught on April 21, 2004, 8 months after the group returned from their temporary &quot;retirement&quot; that began on June 9, 2003 and ended on August 30, in an FBI operation called &quot;Operation Fastlink&quot;.

Police forces from eleven countries were involved, arresting about 120 people and seizing more than 200 computers (including 30 servers). One server from the U.S. raid contained 65,000 pirated titles which were alleged to be in the archive repository of the group.

The operation was coordinated by the FBI, the British National Hi-Tech Crime Unit, the German Bundeskriminalamt (BKA) and the Business Software Alliance, and took place in 27 U.S. states. In the UK, seven computers were seized and three arrests made in Belfast, Manchester and Sheffield. In Singapore, three people (22, 30 &amp; 34 years old) were arrested. In the Netherlands two servers owned by students on 2 universities were investigated by police officers. Other arrests and seizures were made in Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, and Sweden for a total of 11 countries.

According to rumor, the raid occurred just before the warez group would have released the game &quot;&quot;. The game was released by other groups (iNSOMNiA, for Xbox and PS2, and Razor 1911, for PCs) a few days later.

Shortly after the Operation Fastlink raids, council member [Bacchus] writes:
The last massive warez-related raid prior to Fastlink was &quot;Operation Buccaneer&quot; which targeted DrinkOrDie (amongst others) in December 2001.

==Game ISO==
Since October 2006 the ISO division of FairLight has started releasing again. Their PC game ISO division started in late 1998 and by 2011, it was the first group to reach 1000 game ISO releases.

==Records==
FairLight had a short-lived collaboration with TRSI with their cooperative endeavor, &quot;TRSi and Fairlight Recordz&quot;, formed by member Zinkfloid (also known as Uyanik) and Raven from FairLight. The groups released several albums under their brand name &quot;TRSI &amp; FairLight Recordz&quot;, including &quot;Muffler&quot; (2000) and &quot;CNCD&quot; (1995). 

== Later lives ==
, Magnus &quot;Pantaloon&quot; Sjöberg works as lead software engineer at Digital Illusions. Pontus &quot;Bacchus&quot; Berg works in telecom. Fredrik &quot;Gollum&quot; Kahl is now professor in mathematics at Lund University. Per &quot;Zike&quot; Carlbring is a professor in clinical psychology at Stockholm University. Tony &quot;Strider&quot; Krvaric emigrated to the United States in 1992 and is chairman emeritus of the Republican Party of San Diego County. Krvaric later received criticism for an old screen recording on YouTube where he is allegedly shown alongside other Fairlight members in an Amiga demo containing swastikas and Nazi imagery; he denied any association with far-right groups and dismissed the video as part of an &quot;internal GOP smear campaign&quot;.

<doc id="621101" wikidata="Q666621" url="?curid=621101" title="Parilia">
<text>The Parilia or Palilia was an ancient Roman festival of rural character performed annually on 21 April, aimed at cleansing both sheep and shepherd. It was carried out in acknowledgment to the Roman deity Pales, a deity of uncertain gender who was a patron of shepherds and sheep.

Ovid describes the Parilia at length in the &quot;Fasti&quot;, an elegiac poem on the Roman religious calendar, and implies that it predates the founding of Rome (753 BC in the Varronian chronology), as indicated by its pastoral and preagricultural concerns. During the Republic, farming was idealized and central to Roman identity, so the festival took on a more generally rural character. Increasing urbanization caused the rustic Parilia to be reinterpreted rather than abandoned, as Rome was an intensely traditional society. During the Imperial period, the date was celebrated as the birthday of Rome ( or ).

==History==
By the end of the late Republic, the Parilia became associated with the birthday of Rome. Numerous accounts of the founding of Rome exist, but the particular one related to the Parilia is described by Ovid in his &quot;Fasti&quot;. According to this myth, Romulus, upon reaching Rome on the day of the Parilia, took a stick and engraved a line in the ground that defined the boundaries of the new city &quot;(pomerium)&quot;. He then prayed to the gods Jupiter, Mars, and Vesta asking for protection of this area. However, his brother Remus, unaware of the boundaries, crossed the line and was struck down by Romulus&#x27;s henchman Celer. 

Over time, and under the influence of several Roman rulers, the structure of the Parilia changed. First, after Julius Caesar heard the news of Roman Victory at Munda in 45 BC (around the date of the Parilia), he added games to the ceremony. At these games, the citizens would wear crowns in Caesar’s honor. Caligula instituted into the celebration a procession of priests, noblemen, boys and girls of noble birth singing of his virtues while escorting the Golden Shield, previously bestowed upon him by the citizens of Rome, to the Capitol. At this time the Parilia became Rome&#x27;s birthday celebration rather than the rural festival it had once been. In 121 AD, Hadrian founded a new temple of Venus and Roma and changed the festival’s name to the Romaea. This temple was ruined in the 9th century.

==Ceremony==

The pastoral structure of the festival is carried out by the shepherd himself. After the sheep pen had been decorated with green branches and a wreath draped on the gate, the remainder of the ceremony took place in sequence. At the first sign of daylight, the shepherd would purify the sheep: by sweeping the pen and then constructing a bonfire of straw, olive branches, laurel, and sulfur. The noises produced by this burning combination were interpreted as a beneficial omen. The shepherd would jump through this flame, dragging his sheep along with him. Offerings of millet, cakes, and milk were then presented before Pales, marking the second segment of the ceremony. After these offerings, the shepherd would wet his hands with dew, face the east, and repeat a prayer four times. Such prayers requested Pales’s assistance in freeing the shepherd and the flock from evils brought about by accidental wrongdoings (e.g. trespassing on sacred grounds and removing water from a sacred water source). The final portion of the rural festival made use of the beverage burranica, a combination of milk and &quot;sapa&quot; (boiled wine). After consumption of this beverage, the shepherd would leap through the fire three times, bringing an end to the ceremony.

The urban form of the Parilia, on the other hand, is blended with other Roman religious practices and carried out by a priest. Ovid personally participated in this form and describes his experiences in the &quot;Fasti&quot;. While the central actions of the rural ceremony carry over, the urban form adds two ingredients from other religious festivals: the Fordicidia and the October Horse. The Fordicidia sacrifices a pregnant cow to the deity Tellus to promote cattle and field fertility. The unborn calf is then removed from the womb and burnt. The October Horse is the right hand horse of the team that won a particular chariot race on October 15 of the previous year. Together, the ashes of the unborn calf and the blood from the head of the October Horse are mixed by the Vestals and are added to the burning bean straw of the bonfire. Dumézil questioned whether the &quot;Equus October&quot; provided the horse blood, since the two ancient sources that mention the ingredient omit identifying the victim.

<text>The chestnut-backed sparrow-lark (Eremopterix leucotis) is a passerine bird which is a resident breeder in Africa south of the Sahara Desert.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The chestnut-backed sparrow-lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Loxia&quot;. It was later moved to the Lark family Alaudidae under the genus Eremopterix which includes all other sparrow-lark species. Alternate names for this species include: chestnut-backed finch-lark and white-cheeked sparrow-lark.

=== Subspecies ===
Five subspecies are recognized:
* Senegal chestnut-backed finch-lark (&quot;E. l. melanocephalus&quot;) - : Originally described as a separate species in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. Found from Senegal and Gambia to central Sudan
* &quot;E. l. leucotis&quot; - : Found in southern and eastern Sudan, Eritrea, Ethiopia and northwestern Somalia
* East African chestnut-backed finch-lark (&quot;E. l. madaraszi&quot;) - : Found from southern Somalia and Kenya to northern Malawi and northern Mozambique
* &quot;E. l. hoeschi&quot; - : Found from southern Angola and northern Namibia to western Zimbabwe
* South African chestnut-backed finch-lark (&quot;E. l. smithi&quot;) - : Found from southern Zambia and southern Malawi to eastern South Africa

==Description==

This is a small lark at 11 cm. The male is striking, with solid black underparts and head apart from brilliant white patches on the nape and behind the eyes. The upperparts and wings are chestnut with some dark streaking. The thick bill is grey.

The female chestnut-backed sparrow-lark is a drabber bird with heavily streaked buff-white underparts and head, and a white nape collar. The upperparts are chestnut with mottling. Young birds are like the female.

==Distribution and habitat==
This lark is a bird of open dry habitats such as open grassland and arid savanna, preferring recently burned turf, open fields, and gravel plains. They shuffle along in bare patches foraging for seeds and insects. They are both resident and nomadic, although movements are poorly understood. It is often found in mixed flocks with chestnut-headed sparrow-lark where their ranges overlap in NE Africa.

Geographic range:

•Eremopterix leucotis: South Sudan to Ethiopia, Eritrea, and northwestern Somalia

==Behaviour and ecology==
It nests on the ground and lays one egg. Its food is insects and seeds.

<doc id="621109" wikidata="Q58259" url="?curid=621109" title="Hollandaise sauce">
<text>Hollandaise sauce ( or ; , from French &quot;sauce hollandaise&quot; meaning “Dutch sauce”)
 is a mixture of egg yolk, melted butter, and lemon juice (or a white wine or vinegar reduction). It is usually seasoned with salt, and either white pepper or cayenne pepper.

It is well known as a key ingredient of eggs Benedict, and is often served on vegetables such as steamed asparagus.

==Origins==
&quot;Sauce hollandaise&quot; is French for &quot;Hollandic sauce&quot;. The first documented recipe is from 1651 in La Varenne&#x27;s &quot;Le Cuisinier François&quot; for &quot;asparagus with fragrant sauce&quot;: 

 The name was given during the Franco-Dutch war. 

La Varenne is credited with bringing sauces out of the Middle Ages with his publication and may well have invented hollandaise sauce. A more recent name for it is &quot;sauce Isigny&quot;, named after Isigny-sur-Mer, which is famous for its butter. Isigny sauce is found in recipe books starting in the 19th century.

By the 19th century, sauces had been classified into four categories by Carême. One of his categories was &quot;allemande&quot;, which was a stock-based sauce using egg and lemon juice. Escoffier replaced &quot;allemande&quot; with egg-based emulsions, specifically mayonnaise, in his list of the mother sauces of haute cuisine. &quot;Hollandaise&quot; was included in the section on derivatives but in the English translation, the mention of mayonnaise as a mother sauce was removed and &quot;hollandaise&quot; was moved to the section on mother sauces.

While many assume that a true hollandaise sauce should only contain the basic ingredients of eggs, butter, and lemon, Prosper Montagne suggested using either a white wine or vinegar reduction, similar to a Béarnaise sauce, to help improve the taste.

In English, the name &quot;Dutch sauce&quot; was common through the 19th century, but was largely displaced by &quot;hollandaise&quot; in the 20th.

== Preparation and handling==

As in other egg emulsion sauces, like mayonnaise and Béarnaise, the egg does not coagulate as in a custard; rather, the lecithin in the eggs serves as an emulsifier, allowing the mixture of the normally immiscible butter and lemon juice to form a stable emulsion.

To make hollandaise sauce, beaten egg yolks are combined with butter, lemon juice, salt, and water, and heated gently while being mixed. Some cooks use a double boiler to control the temperature. Some recipes add melted butter to warmed yolks; others call for unmelted butter and the yolks to be heated together; still others combine warm butter and eggs in a blender or food processor. Temperature control is critical, as excessive temperature can curdle the sauce. Some chefs start with a reduction. The reduction consists of vinegar, water and cracked peppercorns. These ingredients are reduced to &quot;au sec&quot; or almost dry, strained, and added to the egg yolk mixture.

Hollandaise can be frozen.

==Derivatives== 

Hollandaise and its derivative Mayonnaise (Hollandaise appearing in the 17th century and Mayonnaise appearing in the 18th century) are among the French mother sauces, and the foundation for many derivatives created by adding or changing ingredients, including:

*The most common derivative is egg yolk with reduction sauce Béarnaise. It can be produced by replacing the acidifying agent (vinegar reduction or lemon juice) in a preparation with a strained reduction of vinegar, shallots, fresh chervil, fresh tarragon, and (if to taste) crushed peppercorns. Alternatively, the flavorings may be added to a standard hollandaise. Béarnaise and its children are often used on steak or other &quot;assertive&quot; grilled meats and fish.
**Sauce Choron is a variation of Béarnaise without tarragon or chervil, plus tomato purée.
**Sauce Foyot (or Valois) is Béarnaise with meat glaze.
**Sauce Colbert is sauce Foyot with reduced white wine.
**Sauce Paloise is Béarnaise with mint substituted for tarragon.
*Sauce au vin blanc (for fish) is hollandaise with a reduction of white wine and fish stock.
*Sauce Bavaroise is hollandaise with cream, horseradish, and thyme.
*Sauce crème fleurette is hollandaise with &quot;crème fraîche&quot;.
*Sauce Dijon, also known as sauce moutarde or sauce Girondine, is hollandaise with Dijon mustard.
*Sauce Maltaise is hollandaise with blanched orange zest and the juice of blood orange.
*Sauce Mousseline, also known as sauce Chantilly, is hollandaise with whipped cream folded in.
**Sauce divine is sauce Mousseline with reduced sherry in the whipped cream.
**Madame Benoît&#x27;s recipe for Mousseline uses whipped egg whites instead of whipped cream.
*Sauce noisette is hollandaise made with browned butter.

<text>Us3 were a British jazz rap group founded by London-based producer Geoff Wilkinson in 1992. 

The name was inspired by &quot;Us Three,&quot; a Horace Parlan album produced in 1960 by Alfred Lion, the founder of Blue Note Records. Us3&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hand on the Torch&quot;, used samples from Blue Note songs produced by Lion.

==History==
In the early 1990s, London-based producer Geoff Wilkinson produced two recordings under the name Us3. The first was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Where Will We Be in the 21st Century&quot;, a limited-edition white label 12&quot; release. It drew the attention of independent label Ninja Tune, resulting in NW1&#x27;s 1991 12-inch single &quot;The Band Played The Boogie&quot;, featuring UK rapper Born 2 B. It sampled a dancefloor tune of the burgeoning jazz dance scene, Grant Green&#x27;s &quot;Sookie Sookie&quot;, originally released on Blue Note Records.

After London&#x27;s Kiss FM added &quot;The Band Played The Boogie&quot; to its playlist, Blue Note Records threatened to sue Wilkinson for unapproved use of the sample. Instead, Wilkinson convinced Blue Note executives to sign him to make more music featuring Blue Note samples.

So Wilkinson established Us3 with production partner Mel Simpson. One of the resulting demos, recorded in March 1992, was &quot;Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia)&quot;, featuring UK trumpeter Gerard Presencer. It sampled Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Cantaloupe Island&quot;. Two years later, it entered the US top ten and was included on &quot;Hand on the Torch&quot;, the first Blue Note album to achieve platinum status (1,000,000 sales) in the US.

More touring followed, but personnel changes within Blue Note&#x27;s owner, Capitol Records, allowed Wilkinson to leave and sign to Sony, working with the A&amp;R executive that initially signed him in 1992.. Blue Note samples were not included and two new vocalists joined the group: rapper Michelob, and singer Alison Crockett. However, before the album was complete, a major personnel change at Sony left Us3 in limbo..

After winding up Us3 in 2014, Wilkinson went on to specialise in producing film and library music.

<doc id="621117" wikidata="Q3174545" url="?curid=621117" title="Battle of Pampeluna">
<text>The Battle of Pampluna or Battle of Pamplona was a battle on 20 May 1521 between Spanish and Navarrese troops, who had the support of the French, in which the Fortress of Pamplona was conquered by the Navarrese and French. This battle coincided with an uprising by a part of the Navarrese population, and the swift reconquest of all of Navarre from the Spanish.

== Battle ==

Spain had conquered Iberian Navarre in 1512, including the capital Pamplona.
Former King Henry II of Navarre obtained the support of King Francis I of France to recover his Kingdom.
In 1520, the Crown of Castile seemed weakened by the internal Revolt of the Comuneros, and the Navarrese and French deciced to take advantage of this weakness.
However, the reconquest began only in May 1521, when most of the Comuneros had already been neutralised.

As prepared, a general uprising took place throughout Navarre, including in the city of Pamplona. At the same time, French troops commanded by André de Foix Lord of Lesparre, made up of 12,000 infantry with heavy artillery, crossed the Pyrenees. They easily took Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port on 15 May, then Roncesvalles and Burguete.

When the population of Pamplona rose up, the Viceroy of Navarre, Antonio Manrique de Lara, 2nd Duke of Nájera fled the city on 17 May for Alfaro, La Rioja, being assaulted on the way and robbed. The few Castilian soldiers who remained entrenched themselves in the fortress of Pamplona. When the French arrived on 20 May, they bombarded the fortress for six hours, after which it surrendered. 

Among the Spanish occupants was the Basque captain Íñigo López de Loyola (who later took the religious name of Ignatius), who was wounded at both legs during the bombardment. Among the attackers were Francis Xavier&#x27;s two brothers, Miguel and Juan, who would remain in charge of the city.

The recovery of the Kingdom had not been very bloody. There were further clashes with some 1,000 Basques on Mount Zengarrén, which left some 17 dead and then another 4 dead in Yesa. Nor was there any subsequent retaliation against collaborators with the Spanish.

== Aftermath ==
The reaction of the Spanish was very swift. An army of 30,000 well-equipped men was raised, including many of the defeated Communards who enlisted to redeem their sentence. Helped by errors of General Lesparre, who went with the bulk of his troops to besiege Logrono, without securing the recovery of the Kingdom, the Spanish decisively defeated the Navarrese and French in the Battle of Noáin on 30 June 1521.

The Spanish troops would recover control over Pamplona and the rest of Iberian Navarre in July.

While recovering from injuries sustained during the battle, Íñigo López de Loyola (later taking the name Ignatius) underwent a religious conversion that led him to write &quot;Spiritual Exercises&quot; and later found the Jesuits.

<text>The ashy-crowned sparrow-lark (Eremopterix griseus) is a small sparrow-sized member of the lark family. It is found in the plains in open land with bare ground, grass and scrub across South Asia. The males are well marked with a contrasting black-and-white face pattern, while females are sandy brown, looking similar to a female sparrow. Males are easily detected during the breeding season by the long descending whistle that accompanies their undulating and dive-bombing flight displays.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The ashy-crowned sparrow-lark was originally placed in the genus &quot;Alauda&quot;. This species is also known by the following alternate names: ash-crowned sparrow-lark, ashy-crowned finch-lark, black-bellied finch-lark, and black-bellied sparrow-lark.

Although some subspecies &quot;ceylonensis&quot; (from Sri Lanka) and &quot;siccata&quot; (from Gujarat) have been named, variations are considered to be clinal and they are treated as a monotypic species.

==Description==
Sparrow sized with a finch-like bill and short legs, these birds are usually seen sitting on the ground, and although they will sometimes perch on wires they do not perch in trees or bushes. The male is sandy brown overall with a black belly, chin, lower lores and eye stripe. The top of the head is ashy (although the base of these crown feathers are dark) unlike the dark brown to black in the black-crowned sparrow-lark which partly overlaps with the range of this species in the arid zone of India and Pakistan. The female is pale brown and very similar to a female house sparrow, although the legs are much shorter and appearing stockier and shorter-necked.

==Habitat and distribution==
This species is restricted to below elevation and is found from south of the Himalayas to Sri Lanka extending to the Indus River system in the west and to Assam in the east. It is found in stubble, scrub, waste land, riverside sand and tidal flats on the coast. They avoid the interior of the desert zone, a habitat that is more likely to be used by the black-crowned sparrow-lark. The two species overlap partly in range, although they are rarely seen together in the same locations. During the monsoon season, they withdraw from heavy rainfall regions.

==Behaviour and ecology==
These larks are found in pairs or small groups and form larger flocks in winter. They forage on the ground for seeds and insects. When disturbed they will sometimes crouch and take to flight. They will take fallen grain in fields. They roost at night on the ground, making small depressions in the soil.

The breeding is irregular and spread out although they breed before the rains mainly during February to September in southern India and May to June in Sri Lanka. The display of the male consists of a song flight that involves soaring up with some chirruping calls and then diving with partly closed wings and then rising up in a glide. This undulating flight is accompanied by a long low whistle at each dive and at the tip of each rise by a sharp &quot;&quot; note. The display ends with the male descending at an angle and landing on a small mound or clod before repeating the performance after a few minutes. The nest is a compact depression under a tuft of grass in the ground lined with grass and hair with some pebbles arranged on the edge. The usual clutch is two or three eggs and both males and female incubate the eggs. The eggs hatch after about 13 or 14 days and both parents take turns to feed the young although the female is more active.

In most birds, the right ovary is not fully developed; however, a study found 6 out of 150 specimens had traces of a right ovary although the oviduct was absent.

==In culture==
The name in some Hindi dialects for the bird is , which means &#x27;crouching sparrow&#x27;. In British India, it was shot for the table and termed as &#x27;ortolan&#x27;.

<doc id="621128" wikidata="Q3244653" url="?curid=621128" title="Culture of Haiti">
<text>The culture of [[Haiti]] is a creolized blend of African, European and Taino elements due to the French colonization of Amerindian land (which was then renamed Saint-Domingue), in conjunction with the large diverse enslaved African population who had later freed themselves by a successful revolt. These attributions have largely influenced the art, cuisine, literature, music, religion as well as the languages of Haiti.

==Art==
Brilliant colors, naïve perspective, and sly humor characterize Haitian art. Big, delectable foods and lush landscapes are favorite subjects in this land. Going to market is the most social activity of country life, and figures prominently into the subject matter. Jungle animals, rituals, dances, and gods evoke the African past.

Artists paint in fable as well. People are disguised as animals and animals are transformed into people. Symbols take on great meaning. For example, a rooster often represents Aristide and the red and blue colors of the flag of Haiti, often represent his Lavalas party.

Many artists cluster in &#x27;school&#x27; of painting, such as the Cap-Haïtien school, which features depictions of daily life in the city, the Jacmel School, which reflects the steep mountains and bays of that coastal town, or the Saint-Soleil School, which is characterized by abstracted human forms, and is heavily influenced by Vodou symbolism.

==Architecture==

Haiti&#x27;s most famous monuments are the Sans-Souci Palace and the Citadelle Laferrière, inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1982. Situated in the Northern Massif de la Hotte, in one of Haiti&#x27;s National Parks, the structures date from the early 19th century. The buildings were among the first to be built after Haiti&#x27;s independence from France.

Jacmel, the colonial city that was tentatively accepted as a World Heritage site, is reported to be extensively damaged by the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

Since the earthquake of 2010, architecture has taken a huge turn. With damages at an estimated 10 million dollars, architectural measures were taken immediately. Directly after the earthquake Article 25 of the UK gained about 350 architects in 2010 looking to help rebuild Haiti. There was also a great effort made by the U.S. through the Architecture for Humanity effort that was initiated after the earthquake. The architecture style became very reasonable and involved minimalistic and functional style to help rebuild the damage in the most efficient way possible. There has also been a strong initiative to build more open-air clinics that are designed with health precautions as a huge priority.

==Cuisine==

The French influences in Haiti are present in their cuisine, but more so it is representative of their location in the Caribbean. They do however have their own flavor as a result of the lack of Spanish influence on their island compared to others in the Caribbean. The cooking style used in Haiti is predominately Creole and includes heavy use of pepper in the majority of their dishes. A main staple in Haiti Is starch, and many of their dishes include potatoes, rice, corn, beans, and plantains.

There is also a strong presence of tropical fruits in their cuisine due to their ability to grow in the tropical climate. This includes pineapples, coconuts, mangoes, and other fruits that are used for many dishes and beverages. Food also has importance in religious and status-symbol type forms. Foods that are considered delicacies in Haiti include French inspired cheeses and meats and are a symbol of money and power. Typically these types of meals are only served in the richest part of Haiti, namely in the capital of Port-au-Prince. As far as religious meals go, the Catholics in Haiti typically enjoy more elaborate meals during Christmas Eve.

== Fashion ==
Haiti has the potential to become the fashion capital of the Caribbean due to its recent contributions and success in the industry. Haiti&#x27;s culture is woven in its use of fabrics and forms of garments, which differs from many other countries, giving more focus towards color and volume with many ruffles which makes it unique; gradually making a name for itself in the fashion industry for its creativity, diversity and sustainability incorporating environmental-friendly processes in its materials, which has led to a rise in aspiring Haitian fashion designers throughout the country.

In Haiti, there is a variety of fashion ranging from the more traditional attire to the day-to-day clothing. The traditional female attire consist of Quadrille (or Karabela) dress. The dresses are made of a sturdy material that mainly comes in blue and red, which is usually made from an off-the-shoulder top or bodice with a full matching skirt that is embellished with additional ruffles, lace, or rickrack to add color and visual appeal. A head-scarf or turban can also be worn especially in the more rural areas of Haiti for both traditional and day-to-day use. The traditional male attire consists of a wedding shirt (guayabera) made of lightweight fabrics and are worn untucked with a jacket of any color on top.

Haiti&#x27;s textile industry and its moniker ‘Made In Haiti’ has been long-established in being a key export for the country which has focused on low-end commodity apparel through the use of its low-wage sweatshops that have sewed for some of the biggest American apparel brands such as American Eagle Outfitters, Calvin Klein, DKNY, Hanes, Levi Strauss &amp; Co., Nordstrom and Ralph Lauren.

The typical day-to-day clothes that most Haitians wear are second-hand clothes that are known as &quot;pepe&quot;. Largely stemmimg from the 1960s, the practice of sending and receiving pepe began. Today, you can find pepe being sold by street vendors at a price that is affordable for most Haitians. The majority of pepe that arrive on the island have been donated by Americans to charities and collection centers.&quot;

==Festivals==
The most festive time of the year in Haiti is during Carnival (referred to as &quot;Kanaval&quot; in Haitian Creole or Mardi Gras). The festivities start in February. The cities are filled with music, parade floats, and people dancing and singing in the streets. Carnival week is traditionally a time of all-night parties and escape from daily life. This is a significant time for Haitian musicians for an opportunity to showcase their talents and expand their audience by performing for Carnival crowds. Rara, a festival which occurs before Easter, is celebrated by a significant number of the population as well, and its celebration has been led to rara music becoming a style of Carnival music. Many of the youth also attend parties and enjoy themselves at nightclubs called &quot;discos&quot;, (pronounced &quot;deece-ko&quot;) (not like the discos of the U.S), and attend &quot;Bal&quot;. This term derives from the word ballad, and these events are often celebrated by crowds of many people.

==Folklore and mythology==

Haiti is known for its rich folklore traditions. The country has many magical tales that are part of the Haitian Vodou tradition. The Haitian dictator Papa Doc was a strong believer in the country&#x27;s folklore and used elements of it to guide his brutal rule of the country during the Duvalier dynasty.

==Literature==

The first document of Haitian literature is the collective text &quot;Acte de l&#x27;Indépendance de la République d&#x27;Haïti&quot; (Haitian Declaration of Independence). Since then, Haitian literary culture has been ever-growing and vibrant, recognized both at home and abroad with award-winning authors and large-scale literary events locally and internationally.

==Music and dance==
Haitian music combines a wide range of influences drawn from the many people who have settled on this Caribbean island. It reflects French, African rhythms, Spanish elements and others who have inhabited the island of Hispaniola and minor native Taino influences. Styles of music unique to the nation of Haiti include music derived from Vodou ceremonial traditions, rara parading music, twoubadou &quot;ballads&quot;, mini-jazz rock bands, rasin movement, hip hop kreyòl, the wildly popular compas, and méringue as its basic rhythm.

Very popular today is compas, short for &quot;compas direct&quot;, made popular by Nemours Jean-Baptiste, on a recording released in 1955. The name derives from &quot;compás&quot;, the Spanish word meaning rhythm or tones. It involves mostly medium-to-fast tempo beats with an emphasis on electric guitars, synthesizers, and either a solo alto saxophone, a horn section or the synthesizer equivalent. In Creole, it is spelled as &quot;konpa dirèk&quot; or simply &quot;konpa&quot;. It is commonly spelled as it is pronounced as &quot;kompa&quot;.

Dancing is an important part of Haitian life. In the case of Vodou, the religious experience of spirit possession is usually accompanied by dancing, singing, and drumming. Carnival and rara celebrations feature exuberant dancing and movement in the streets. Dancing is also a social activity, used for celebrations such as church socials and informal parties, as well as evenings out with friends. In small restaurants, social dance music is provided by relatively small twoubadou groups, while larger clubs with big dance floors often feature dance bands reminiscent of the American big bands in size. Social dance music has been one of the most heavily creolized music forms in Haiti. European dance forms such as the contradanse (kontradans), quadrille, waltz, and polka were introduced to white planter audiences during the colonial period. Musicians, either slaves or freed people of color, learned the European dance forms and adapted them for their own use. One of the most popular African-influenced dance styles was the méringue (mereng in Creole). Along with the carabinier, the méringue was a favorite dance style of the Haitian elite and was a regular feature at elite dances. The Haitian expression, &quot;Mereng ouvri bal, mereng fème ba&quot;; (The mereng opens the ball, the mereng closes the ball) alludes to the popularity and ubiquity of the méringue as an elite entertainment. In nineteenth-century Haiti, the ability to dance the méringue, as well as a host of other dances, was considered a sign of good breeding. Like other creolized dance styles, the méringue was claimed by both elite and proletarian Haitian audiences as a representative expression of Haitian cultural values.

==Religion==
Haiti is similar to the rest of Latin America, in that it is a predominantly Christian country, with 80% Roman Catholic and approximately 16% professing Protestantism. A small population of Muslims and Hindus exist in the country, principally in the capital of Port-au-Prince.

Vodou, encompassing several different traditions, consists of a mix of Central and Western African, European, and Native American (Taíno) religions is also widely practiced, despite the negative stigma that it carries both in and out of the country. The exact number of Vodou practitioners is unknown; however, it is believed that a large amount of the population practice it, often alongside their Christian faith. Some secular Christians also have been known to participate in some rituals, although indirectly.

==Social etiquette==
==Sports==

Football is the most popular sport in Haiti, though basketball is growing in popularity. Hundreds of small football clubs compete at the local level. Stade Sylvio Cator is the multi-purpose stadium in Port-au-Prince, Haiti where it is currently used mostly for association football matches that fits a capacity of 30,000 people.

Samuel Dalembert and Olden Polynice are former NBA players born in Haiti.

Haitian football player Joseph Gaetjens played for the United States national team in the 1950 FIFA World Cup, scoring the winning goal in the 1–0 upset of England.

In the early 20th century, it was reported that cockfighting was also a popular sport, though its popularity has since faded.

==Traditional knowledge==
Haiti&#x27;s traditional knowledge found its first prominent champion in the ethnographer Jean Price-Mars, who&#x27;s seminal &quot;So spoke the uncle&quot; (in French &quot;Ainsi parla L&#x27;oncle&quot;) argued in favor of a greater respect and appreciation of Haiti&#x27;s African-rooted, largely oral-based peasant culture. Since then numerous authors and thinkers have documented the country&#x27;s rich and complex traditional knowledge, whether it be in its approach to education and morality, architecture and construction, or botany and medicine.

<text>Maschinenfest was an annual three-day underground music festival in Germany, featuring industrial, power electronics, noise and other alternative electronic performers. It included both independent and signed bands as well as many vendors for music and related merchandise. Featured record labels and noteworthy companies included Ant-Zen, Hands Productions, Pflichtkauf, Spectre Records and Ad Noiseam.

==History==
The festival was traditionally held in October in the bunker of the Autonomes Zentrum (AZ) deep underground Aachen, Germany. The venue posed some problems with heat, humidity and air circulation, as well as condensation dripping on to the gear of the performers, but the atmosphere of the bunker proved quite fitting to the genres of music played throughout the festival. For only one edition, in 2003, the festival moved to the castle ruin of Schloss Leerodt in Geilenkirchen. From 2004 to 2008, Maschinenfest was held at the Kulturfabrik in Krefeld, Germany. In 2009, the festival was held in Essen, and starting in 2010, the festival was held in the Turbinenhalle in Oberhausen.

Part of the pre-festival activities was the &quot;Maschinenfaces&quot; page where the visitors could add pictures of themselves and state where they were staying and who they were with as well as comment on each other&#x27;s pictures.

An April Fools&#x27; Day posting on the Side-Line website claimed that the 2008 edition, the 10th one, would also be the final one.
This was not the case.

In 2011 Wolfram Bange, Henning Hinck, Sebastian Vogel and Lena Neugebauer filmed a documentary about the festival. It was a tribute to the scene and can be watched on several video platforms for free.

<text>In real-time computing, priority inheritance is a method for eliminating unbounded priority inversion. Using this programming method, a process scheduling algorithm increases the priority of a process (A) to the maximum priority of any other process waiting for any resource on which A has a resource lock (if it is higher than the original priority of A).

The basic idea of the priority inheritance protocol is that when a job blocks one or more high-priority jobs, it ignores its original priority assignment and executes its critical section at an elevated priority level. After executing its critical section and releasing its locks, the process returns to its original priority level.

==Example==
Consider three jobs:

Suppose that both H and L require some shared resource. If L acquires this shared resource (entering a critical section), and H subsequently requires it, H will block until L releases it (leaving its critical section). Without priority inheritance, process M could preempt process L during the critical section and delay its completion, in effect causing the lower-priority process M to indirectly preempt the high-priority process H. This is a priority inversion bug.

With priority inheritance, L will execute its critical section at H&#x27;s high priority whenever H is blocked on the shared resource. As a result, M will be unable to preempt L and will be blocked. That is, the higher-priority job M must wait for the critical section of the lower priority job L to be executed, because L has inherited H&#x27;s priority. When L exits its critical section, it regains its original (low) priority and awakens H (which was blocked by L). H, having high priority, preempts L and runs to completion. This enables M and L to resume in succession and run to completion without priority inversion.

<text>John de Warenne, 6th [[Earl of Surrey]] (123127 September 1304) was a prominent English nobleman and military commander during the reigns of Henry III of England and Edward I of England. During the Second Barons&#x27; War he switched sides twice, ending up in support of the king, for whose capture he was present at Lewes in 1264. Warenne was later appointed as &quot;warden of the kingdom and land of Scotland&quot; and featured prominently in Edward I&#x27;s wars in Scotland.

==Early life and marriage==

Warenne was the son and heir of William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey, and Maud Marshal. His mother was the daughter of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke and widow of Hugh Bigod, 3rd Earl of Norfolk, making Roger Bigod, 4th Earl of Norfolk his elder half-brother.

A boy when his father died, Warenne became a royal ward. Peter of Savoy was appointed guardian of his holdings and Warenne was raised at the royal court. In 1247, he married Henry III&#x27;s half-sister Alice le Brun de Lusignan, a marriage that created resentment amongst the English nobility, who did not like seeing a wealthy English nobleman marrying a penniless foreigner.

During the following years, Warenne was closely associated with the court faction centering on his in-laws. In 1254, he accompanied the king&#x27;s son Edward (the future Edward I) on Edward&#x27;s journey to Spain to marry Eleanor of Castile.

During the conflicts between Henry III and his barons, Warenne started as a strong supporter of the king, switched to support for Simon de Montfort, and then returned to the royalist party. He opposed the initial baronial reform plan of May 1258, but along with other opponents capitulated and took the oath of the Provisions of Oxford.

==Second Barons&#x27; War==
By 1260, Warenne had joined the party of Simon de Montfort, but switched back to the king&#x27;s side in 1263. In April 1264, he and Roger de Leybourne were besieged by de Montfort at Rochester Castle. In May of the same year Warenne was present for the Battle of Lewes (fought near his ancestral home, Lewes Castle). After the capture of the king and Prince Edward he fled to the Continent, where he remained for about a year. His estates were confiscated but were subsequently restored. He returned to fight in the campaign which culminated in the Battle of Evesham, the Battle of Chesterfield and the siege of Kenilworth Castle.

Warenne served in King Edward I&#x27;s Welsh campaigns in 1277, 1282 and 1283. In 1282, Edward awarded him the Lordship of Bromfield and Yale in Wales, which was taken from Prince Gruffudd Fychan I and his son Madog Crypl. He also started the construction of his castle there named Holt Castle, which was continued by his son William. A good part of the following years were spent in Scotland. He was one of the negotiators for the 1289 treaty of Salisbury and for the 1290 treaty of Birgham, and accompanied the king on Edward&#x27;s 1296 invasion of Scotland where he commanded the only major field action of that year in the Battle of Dunbar.

==Scotland==
On 22 August 1296, the king appointed him &quot;warden of the kingdom and land of Scotland&quot;. However, Warenne returned to England a few months later claiming that the Scottish climate was bad for his health. The following spring saw the rebellion of William Wallace, Warenne was ordered to lead his army North by the king after initially refusing to return to Scotland. He was defeated by Wallace at the Battle of Stirling Bridge and fled to York.

Nevertheless, the king appointed Warenne captain of the next campaign against the Scots in early 1298. He raised the siege of Roxburgh and re-took the town of Berwick. The king himself took the field later that year, and Warenne was one of the commanders during the decisive English victory at the Battle of Falkirk.

In the 1300 campaign, Warrene commanded one of four cavalry units in Edward I&#x27;s army. On 8 August, near the estuary of the Cree, Edward ordered his men and Warenne&#x27;s to charge at a Scottish force—causing the Scots to flee.

==Quo warranto?==
In 1278, Edward I called a parliament at Gloucester with the intention of determining which lords had usurped royal rights—specifically, rights of adjudication—and reclaiming those rights. Walter of Guisborough tells the story that the earl was served a writ of &quot;quo warranto&quot; (&quot;by what warrant?&quot;) as a result of these proceedings. Warenne supposedly responded by drawing a rusty sword and exclaiming that this was his warrant, saying, &quot;My ancestors came with William the Bastard, and conquered their lands with the sword, and I will defend them with the sword against anyone wishing to seize them.&quot;

==Later years==
Warenne died on 27 September 1304 in Kennington, Surrey. He was interred in Lewes Priory at a service conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury. He was succeeded by his grandson, also called John.

==Issue==

Warenne and Alice de Lusignan had three children:
* Eleanor, who married Henry Percy and was the mother of Henry de Percy, 1st Baron Percy of Alnwick (see Percy family)
* Isabella, who married John Balliol (briefly the King of Scots), and was the mother of Edward Balliol;
* William, who married Joan, daughter of Robert de Vere, 5th Earl of Oxford, and was accidentally killed at a tournament on 15 December 1286. Their son John succeeded his grandfather as earl of Surrey; their daughter Alice de Warenne married Edmund Fitzalan, 9th Earl of Arundel.

<text>Riccardo Chailly (, ; born 20 February 1953) is an Italian conductor. He is currently music director of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra and of La Scala. Prior to this, he held chief conducting positions at the Gewandhausorchester (2005–2016); the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra (1988–2004); the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra (1982–1988); and the Teatro Comunale of Bologna (1986–1993). He was also the first musical director of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi (1999–2005) and principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1983–1986). 

Born in Milan, Chailly first studied composition with his father, Luciano Chailly, in his youth. He continued with composition at the conservatories in Milan and Perugia, but later shifted to conducting under Piero Guarino and Franco Ferrara. He made his conducting debut at La Scala in 1978 with Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Werther&quot;, where he had been assistant director to Claudio Abbado since 1973. Upon becoming principal conductor at the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, he embarked on performing standard symphonic works—particularly Bruckner and Mahler—but expanded the orchestra&#x27;s previously minuscule 20th century and contemporary repertoire. For 30 years he has recorded exclusively with Decca, and recordings with the Gewandhausorchester have been particularly acclaimed.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Chailly was born on 20 February 1953 into a musical family of Romagnol and French descent based in Milan. His father Luciano was a noted composer and arts administrator, holding positions at numerous Italian musical institutions, including as music director of La Scala. Luciano&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; was centered on a neoclassical aesthetic, influenced by his former teacher Paul Hindemith, which granted him an epitaph as the &quot;Italian Hindemith&quot;. Luciano Chailly married Riccardo&#x27;s mother Anna Maria in 1950; Riccardo has two sisters, the harpist Cecilia Chailly and the television producer Floriana Chailly. Taken by his father to his first concert at age 6, Chailly quickly became obsessed with music, explaining in a 2002 interview by &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do anything else, and always chose music over regular boyhood activities such as sports&quot;. Chailly studied composition with his father, took private piano lessons and played drums in The Nameless, a free jazz ensemble. Despite Chailly&#x27;s musical enthusiasm, his father was reluctant to readily encourage him. He was disappointed by his son&#x27;s lack of interest in the technical aspects such as musicology, his general mediocrity with instruments other than the drums and wanted to avoid any appearance of nepotism.

Chailly studied composition at the music conservatories in Milan and Perugia. He later switched to conducting, studying with both Piero Guarino and Franco Ferrara. In his youth, Chailly also played the drums in a rhythm-and-blues band.

At age 20, Chailly became assistant conductor to Claudio Abbado at La Scala, where he made his conducting debut in 1978 with &quot;Werther&quot; by Jules Massenet. From 1982 to 1988, Chailly was chief conductor of the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra and from 1983 to 1986 principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra. From 1986 to 1993, he led the Teatro Comunale of Bologna.

===Career===
Chailly made his debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam in January 1985. The orchestra announced his appointment as chief conductor in June 1985, effective with the 1988–1989 season. Chailly served as the orchestra&#x27;s chief conductor from 1988 to 2004. In addition to performances of the standard symphonic tradition, notably Anton Bruckner and Gustav Mahler, he broadened the repertoire with 20th century and contemporary music. Among notable projects, Chailly led the 1995 Mahler Festival that celebrated the 100th anniversary of Mahler&#x27;s first concert at the Concertgebouw. Chailly also conducted opera in Amsterdam, both at the RCO&#x27;s annual Christmas Matinee concert as well as at De Nederlandse Opera (DNO), where his final opera production in Amsterdam was DNO&#x27;s staging of Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Don Carlo&quot;. One report stated that Chailly decided in 2002 to leave the RCO when, at his last contract negotiations, the orchestra offered him an extension for two years rather than five.

In 1986, Chailly conducted the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig for the first time, at the Salzburg Festival, after Herbert von Karajan had introduced Chailly to the orchestra. His next guest-conducting appearance with the Leipzig orchestra was in 2001, and after an additional appearance, he was named the 19th &quot;Kapellmeister&quot; of the orchestra. In August 2005, he officially became the chief conductor of the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig and general music director (GMD) of Oper Leipzig. His initial Leipzig contract was to run through to 2010. In May 2008, he extended his contract with the Gewandhausorchester to 2015. However, he concurrently resigned as GMD of the Oper Leipzig, reportedly after a conflict over the hiring of personnel without his consultation. In June 2013, the Gewandhausorchester and Chailly agreed on a further extension of his contract through 2020. However, in September 2015, the Gewandhausorchester announced the newly scheduled conclusion of Chailly&#x27;s tenure as &quot;Gewandhauskapellmeister&quot; in June 2016, four years ahead of the previously agreed upon contract extension, at Chailly&#x27;s request. His projects in Leipzig have included an international Mahler festival in May 2011, featuring 10 different orchestras.

Chailly became the first music director of the Orchestra Sinfonica di Milano Giuseppe Verdi (La Verdi) in 1999 and held the post until 2005. He now has the title of Conductor Laureate with La Verdi. In December 2013, La Scala announced the appointment of Chailly as its next music director, starting in 2017. His La Scala contract is currently through 2026. In August 2015, the Lucerne Festival Orchestra announced the appointment of Chailly as its next music director, effective with the 2016 Lucerne Festival, with an initial contract of 5 years. In February 2021, the orchestra announced an extension of Chailly&#x27;s contract through 2026.

==Recordings==
Chailly has an exclusive recording contract with Decca, and his recordings with Decca include complete cycles of the symphonies of Johannes Brahms, Gustav Mahler and Anton Bruckner. His Brahms cycle with the Gewandhausorchester won the 2014 Gramophone Award for Recording of the Year. Other notable achievements include recordings of Igor Stravinsky, Edgard Varèse and Paul Hindemith. More recently, with the Gewandhaus Orchestra, Chailly has led recordings of Felix Mendelssohn, Johann Sebastian Bach, Brahms, Robert Schumann&#x27;s symphonies in the re-orchestrations by Mahler, and a complete cycle of Beethoven&#x27;s symphonies. His past recordings with American orchestras included &quot;Shostakovich: The Dance Album&quot; with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Le Sacre du printemps&quot; with the Cleveland Orchestra.

==Personal life==
Chailly has been married twice. His first marriage was in 1974 to Anahi Carfi, an Argentinian-Italian violinist, with whom he had a daughter that year; the couple divorced two years later. He married Gabriella Terragni in 1982, from whom he has a stepson.

Earlier in his life, Chailly was an avid partaker in extreme sports, including motorbiking, speedboating and parasailing. However, after he and his stepson were involved in a serious accident in 1985, Chailly abandoned these activities.

<text>Conca de Barberà () is a comarca (county) in the region of Camp de Tarragona, Catalonia, Spain. Its total area is , and its capital is Montblanc.

At its creation in 1936, it contained 23 municipalities, but in 1990, several of these were amalgamated; Rojals was combined with Montblanc, and Montbrió de la Marca was amalgamated with Sarral. Also in 1990, Vallfogona de Riucorb was moved from the Segarra comarca. This resulted in the current total of 22 municipalities.

==Geography==
The comarca of Conca de Barberà is divided into three geographical zones. The lowland sector consists of the physical Conca de Barberà region: the valleys of the Rivers Francolí and Anguera (&quot;Conca&quot; means a river valley, and Barberà is one of the principal villages in the valley). The capital of the comarca, Montblanc is at the southern end of this sector at the confluence of these two rivers. The northern edge of the Conca is marked by the Serra del Tallat escarpment, which separates it from the &quot;Baixa Segarra&quot; (&quot;Lower Segarra&quot;) region, and the south-western zone of the comarca is formed by the Prades Mountains, part of the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range. which straddle the border between Conca de Barberà and the adjoining comarcas of Alt Camp, Baix Camp, Garrigues and Priorat. These rounded limestone outcrops are clad in forests of pine, oak and chestnut. The climate of the comarca is transitional between a Mediterranean climate and the continental inland climate. The rainfall averages , mostly falling in spring and autumn. It can be foggy in winter and the temperature can rise to in summer. The comarca has a rich and diverse flora and fauna.

==Wind power==
The northern Serra del Tallat region is the site of several wind farms. When the Catalan Government’s Energy Plan 2006–2015 was prepared with proposals that affected the comarca of Conca de Barberà, opinion was divided. Some municipalities favoured the construction of the wind turbines as generating income which would benefit the community, while others objected to the imposition of such projects by the Catalan authorities without sufficient input by the affected municipalities. In January 2012 it was announced that wind power production in Catalonia had reached 1,000 megawatts, enough to supply over four percent of Catalonia&#x27;s power needs.

<doc id="621151" wikidata="Q1544834" url="?curid=621151" title="Kentucky River">
<text>The Kentucky River is a tributary of the Ohio River in Kentucky, United States. The river and its tributaries drain much of eastern and central Kentucky, passing through the Eastern Coalfield, the Cumberland Mountains, and the Bluegrass region. Its watershed encompasses about , and it supplies drinking water to about one-sixth of the population of the state.

The river is no longer navigable above Lock 4 at Frankfort, as concrete bulkheads have been poured behind the upper lock gates of Locks 5–14 to strengthen the dam structures. All fourteen dams are managed by the state-run Kentucky River Authority. The primary importance of the locks today is to maintain a pool that allows the city of Lexington to draw its drinking water from the river. Although the Lexington area receives well over of precipitation annually, the limestone karst geology of the area allows little natural surface water.

The cities of Winchester, Beattyville, Irvine, Richmond, Lancaster, Nicholasville, Harrodsburg, Wilmore, Versailles, Lawrenceburg, and Frankfort also draw water from the river for their municipal water supplies. It is estimated that more than 700,000 people depend on the river for water.

==Description==

The main stem of the Kentucky River is formed near Beattyville in Lee County by the confluence of the North, Middle, and South Forks. The river flows generally northwest, in a highly meandering course through the Eastern Coalfield and the Daniel Boone National Forest before turning southwest north of Richmond and then north through Frankfort. It joins the Ohio River at Carrollton.

Approximately southeast of Boonesborough, the Kentucky is joined by the Red River. Approximately west of Boonesborough, it is joined by Silver Creek. At High Bridge, it is joined by the Dix River. At Frankfort, it is joined by Benson Creek; this confluence was the junction of Kentucky&#x27;s three original counties. At Monterey, approximately north of Frankfort, it is joined by Elkhorn Creek, which drains much of the Inner Bluegrass region.

Between Clays Ferry in Madison County and Frankfort, the river passes through the Kentucky River Palisades, a series of dramatic steep gorges approximately in length.

==Forks==
The Kentucky River has three major forks: the North, Middle, and South Forks. The Middle and North Forks join near Beattyville to form the Kentucky River, which is joined in turn just downstream of Beattyville by the South Fork. The area between the confluence of the North and Middle Forks and where the South Fork joins is known locally as The Three Forks Country. Between them, the three forks drain nearly of the central portion of the Eastern Kentucky Coalfield area.
The North Fork Kentucky River is approximately long. At Airdale, the North Fork has a mean average discharge of approximately 863 cubic feet per second, per data collected during the period 1930–1942.

The Middle Fork Kentucky River is approximately long. At Tallega, the Middle Fork has a mean annual discharge of 792 cubic feet per second.

The South Fork Kentucky River is approximately long. At Booneville, the South Fork has a mean annual discharge of 1,052 cubic feet per second.

== Floods ==

The Kentucky River basin is subject to regular flooding caused by high rainfall. The river&#x27;s narrow valley and surrounding rocky terrain cause rainwater to run off into many ephemeral creeks rather than being absorbed into the soil. Much of the built environment in the area is located along the creek beds.

Kentucky River flooding has been recorded since the early 1800s. Swiss immigrant and lock-keeper Frank Wurtz recorded floods from 1867 on and spoke with local farmers to learn of earlier ones in 1817, 1832, 1847, and 1854. Wurtz documented the floods of 1867, 1880, and 1883, which he claims was five feet higher than the high tide of the 1847 flood. The waters of the 1883 flood washed his post away.

On January 1, 1919, the waters rose ten feet in as many hours at Frankfort, causing damage to many smaller towns along the river. In November of the same year, the waters rose three feet in one hour at Frankfort. In 1920, flooding caused the sewers in Frankfort to back up. There was also major flooding in early 1924 and late December 1926.

Flooding in 1927 caused widespread damage to the Kentucky River basin in communities such as Neon, Whitesburg, and Hazard. Hundreds of people were forced from their homes.

=== Flooding and flood control in the 1930s ===
The Kentucky River basin endured many floods during the Great Depression. An Ohio River flood in 1936 backed into the lower Kentucky; the crest reached high and flooded half of Frankfort, completely isolating the city. of the Ohio Valley were flooded in all.

Severe flooding in 1937, exacerbated by cold weather, resulted in civil unrest. In the Kentucky State Reformatory at Frankfort, the water rose to in the walls. With the downstairs population moving up a floor, racial tensions erupted. 24 prisoners tried to escape, but after a warning shot was fired, only one man left. No clean water or food was left in the prison, so authorities moved the population of 2,900 to the &quot;feeble-minded institute&quot; on the hill next to the prison. Carpenters were brought in to build small, temporary housing units. The National Guard was brought in to oversee the makeshift prison. The prisoners considered to be too dangerous for the setting were sent to Lawrenceburg and Lexington. Governor Happy Chandler successfully pushed for a new reformatory to be built in La Grange.

While the public was still dealing with the effects of the flooding, Kentucky Utilities opened the Dix Dam spillways, which added to the floodwaters. In Mercer County, the ferry to Woodford County washed away and was never replaced. A flood in 1939 rose slightly higher in Hazard than the flood in 1937.

Residents of the Kentucky River watershed demanded the federal government do more to control floods. Kentucky Hydro-Electric had begun pushing as early as 1925 for a dam above Booneville on the South Fork, but this proposal was unpopular as the dam would create a reservoir backing up the South Fork for over .

In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Flood Control Act of 1938, which authorized the construction or study of many dams and reservoirs by the Army Corps of Engineers. Only two small lakes, Carr Fork and Buckhorn, were created in the Kentucky River watershed. The most controversial project, a Red River dam that would have flooded most of the river&#x27;s gorge, was ultimately abandoned in 1975.

=== January and February 1957 ===
The Kentucky River basin, including the three Forks and their tributaries, suffered a major flood in January and February 1957, although that did not exceed the highest on record on North Fork (and on its tributary Troublesome Creek), the Goose Creek tributary of South Fork, and Carr Fork, all of which had had higher local floods at that point. The 1957 flood also affected the Big Sandy River, the Cumberland River, and the Tennessee River. The total cost of damages was estimated at in the Kentucky River basin, out of across Kentucky as a whole.

It also affected south-western West Virginia, western Virginia, and north-eastern Tennessee, but Kentucky state was the hardest hit.
In part this was because of the physical geography of the area, as aforementioned.

There had been of rainfall a week before the floods, which had saturated the ground and filled streams to their median levels, and in the period from the 27th of January to the 2nd of February there was of rainfall.
The highest rainfall of the floods within Kentucky state was measured in the Pikeville area, with over much of the flood area and at the headwaters of Middle Fork.

The highest peak river discharges then on record were measured along all three Forks of the Kentucky River.

There were no early warnings of the floods, as communications were disrupted. Approximately 7,700 telephones and 103 long-distance telephone lines were taken out of service. Most people had to evacuate their homes rapidly without time to transport their possessions. Water supplies were contaminated, natural gas supplies were cut off making it difficult to cook, and food shortages occurred because of damage to food stocks on people&#x27;s homes and in local stores.

President Eisenhower declared the region a disaster area. The Red Cross, one of several relief organizations that came to aid alongside the federal and state governments, reported the destruction of 597 homes, major damage to another 2,932 homes, and minor damage to a further 8,740. Nine people died. Several rural school buildings were entirely destroyed, and many others were closed either because of damage or because transportation disruption meant that people simply could not get to them. The most costly school loss was the State Vocational School at Hazard (), with the rest of Perry County having some worth of damage to other schools, and Floyd County having worth of damage to its schools.

Highway damage made transport of relief supplies difficult, with the United States Army sending in 14 helicopters for transport of supplies, headquartered at London. Approximately 900 mines and manufacturing industries, and 90% of the coal mines in Perry, Letcher, Floyd, and Pike Counties, were shut down. Ninety-six cable-suspended footbridges providing access to highways were destroyed.

==Recreation==
The river provides excellent fishing. The largest goldeye ever taken in the state of Kentucky () was caught in the Kentucky River in 2001, as was the state-record bighead carp, caught in 2020.

<text>David Zinman (born July 9, 1936, in Brooklyn, New York) is an American conductor and violinist.

==Education==
After violin studies at Oberlin Conservatory, Zinman studied theory and composition at the University of Minnesota, earning his M.A. in 1963. He took up conducting at Tanglewood and from 1958 to 1962 worked in Maine with Pierre Monteux; he served as Monteux&#x27;s assistant from 1961 to 1964.

==Career==
===Netherlands===
Zinman held the post of second conductor of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra from 1965 to 1977 and was principal conductor of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra from 1979 to 1982.

===United States===
Zinman served as music director of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra from 1974 to 1985, during the last two years of which tenure he also was principal guest conductor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. He became music director in Baltimore in 1985. There he made several recordings for Telarc, Argo, and Sony. He also toured widely and began to implement ideas from the historically-informed-performance movement in interpretations of the Beethoven symphonies. Upon relinquishing that Baltimore post in 1998, Zinman was named the orchestra&#x27;s conductor laureate. But he renounced this title three years later in protest at what he saw as the orchestra&#x27;s increasingly conservative programming. 

In 1998 Zinman worked as music director of the Ojai Music Festival alongside pianist Mitsuko Uchida. That same year he was appointed music director of the Aspen Music Festival and School, where he founded and directed its American Academy of Conducting until his sudden resignation in April 2010.

===Switzerland===
Zinman became music director of the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in 1995. His innovative programming with that orchestra included a series of late-night concerts, &quot;Tonhalle Late&quot;, which combined classical music and a nightclub setting. His recordings of the complete Beethoven symphonies for Arte Nova were based on the Jonathan Del Mar critical edition and was acclaimed by critics. He subsequently recorded Beethoven&#x27;s overtures and concertos with the Tonhalle. He conducted the Tonhalle Orchestra in its first-ever appearance at The Proms in 2003. He concluded his Tonhalle music directorship on July 21, 2014, with a concert at The Proms.

=== Film scores ===
Zinman conducted the soundtrack of the 1993 film of the New York City Ballet production of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker&quot;. In 2009 he led the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in the filmscore &quot;180°: If Your World Is Suddenly Upside-Down&quot;, composed by the sibling trio Diego Baldenweg with Nora Baldenweg and Lionel Baldenweg; this won the Suisa prize for &quot;Best Original Score&quot; at the Locarno Film Festival in 2010.

==Awards==
In 2006, he received the Theodore Thomas Award presented by the Conductors&#x27; Guild. 

===Best-selling recording===
Zinman&#x27;s 1992 recording of Henryk Górecki’s &quot;Symphony no.3&quot; with Dawn Upshaw and the London Sinfonietta was an international bestseller.

==Personal life==
Zinman and his second wife, Mary, an Australian violist, live in New Jersey. Zinman has two sons and a daughter.
