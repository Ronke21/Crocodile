<text>Sinclair, Inc., doing business as Sinclair Broadcast Group, is a publicly traded American telecommunications conglomerate that is controlled by the descendants of company founder Julian Sinclair Smith. Headquartered in the Baltimore suburb of Cockeysville, Maryland, the company is the second-largest television station operator in the United States by number of stations, after Nexstar Media Group, owning or operating 193 stations across the country in over 100 markets, covering 40% of American households. It is the largest owner of stations affiliated with Fox, NBC, CBS, ABC, MyNetworkTV, and The CW. Sinclair owns four digital multicast networks, Comet, Charge!, The Nest, and TBD, and sports-oriented cable networks, Stadium, and Tennis Channel. In June 2021, Sinclair became a &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 company, having reached 2020 annual revenues of billion, equivalent to $billion in .

A 2019 study in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that &quot;stations bought by Sinclair reduce coverage of local politics, increase national coverage and move the ideological tone of coverage in a conservative direction relative to other stations operating in the same market&quot;. The company has been criticized by journalists and media analysts for requiring its stations to broadcast packaged video segments and its news anchors to read prepared scripts that contain pro-Trump editorial content, including warnings about purported &quot;fake news&quot; in mainstream media, while Trump has tweeted support for watching Sinclair over CNN and NBC.

==History==

===Early roots===
The company&#x27;s roots date back to the late 1950s, when electrical engineer Julian Sinclair Smith and his wife Carolyn B. Smith, owning 34.5% of the shares, along with a group of shareholders, formed the Commercial Radio Institute, a broadcasting trade school in Baltimore, Maryland. In March 1958, Commercial Radio Institute applied to build an FM radio station in Baltimore. In April 1959, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the construction permitfor the estimated () construction project. Sinclair&#x27;s first station, WFMM-FM (now WPOC), signed on the air in February 1960.

In 1967, Smith, as Chesapeake Engineering Placement Service, partly owned by the name-shortened Commercial Radio Inc., applied for and was granted, a construction permit for a new UHF television station in Baltimore, expected to be operating by September 1968 on channel 45, no call sign yet assigned.

===Chesapeake Television Corporation===

Channel 45, with the call sign WBFF, joined on April 11, 1971. By that time, Chesapeake Engineering Placement Service had changed its name to Chesapeake Television Corporation. The Commercial Radio Institute, by then a division of Chesapeake Television Corporation, founded WPTT (now WPNT) in Pittsburgh, in 1978, and WTTE in Columbus, Ohio, in 1984. All three stations originally were independents. In 1986, WBFF and WTTE became charter affiliates of the Fox Broadcasting Company at its launch. The Fox affiliation in Pittsburgh went to higher-rated WPGH-TV, which was purchased by Sinclair in 1990.

Chesapeake&#x27;s first foray into local news came in the early 1980s when it launched a newscast on WPTT, a rarity at this time for stations not affiliated with the then-major networks (ABC, CBS and NBC). This newscast was called &quot;WPTT News&quot;. In the opening segment, the letters &quot;news&quot; were formed from a compass indicating the four cardinal directions. This opening segment, featuring then-anchorman Kevin Evans, appeared briefly, and was audible, in the movie &quot;Flashdance&quot; during a scene where Jennifer Beals&#x27; character returns home and turns on the television. 

The presentation was relatively low-budget, with the anchor simply reading copy, with no field video shots other than the weather read over a stock video shot denoting the conditions outside. It was not a factor in taking ratings away from then-market laggard WIIC-TV, now WPXI, much less solid runner-up WTAE-TV and then-locally owned Group W powerhouse KDKA-TV. As WBFF did not air newscasts until 1991 and WTTE would not air any newscasts from its 1984 sign-on until Sinclair purchased ABC affiliate WSYX in 1996, this marked the company&#x27;s only foray into local news for years, a genre it became much more involved in from the mid-1990s on.

===Sinclair Broadcast Group===
====1985–2010====
Smith&#x27;s son David D. Smith began taking a more active role in the company in the 1980s. In 1985, the Chesapeake Television Corporation changed its name to Sinclair Broadcast Group. In 1990, David and his three brothers bought their parents&#x27; remaining stock and went on a buying spree that eventually made it one of the largest station owners in the country, through the purchases of stations and of companies that owned groups of stations.

Sinclair pioneered the concept of the local marketing agreement (LMA) in American television in 1991, when it sold WPTT to its general manager Eddie Edwards (founder of Glencairn, Ltd., the Sinclair-affiliated licensee that would eventually become Cunningham Broadcasting) in order to purchase fellow Pittsburgh station WPGH-TV to comply with FCC ownership rules of the time that prohibited duopolies, while agreeing to allow Sinclair to retain operational responsibilities for the station. However, while LMAs would become an integral part of the company&#x27;s business model in subsequent years, Sinclair&#x27;s plans to acquire KOKH-TV in Oklahoma City through Glencairn, which would subsequently attempt to sell five of its 11 existing LMA-operated stations to Sinclair outright in turn (with Sinclair stock included in the deal) was challenged by the Rainbow/PUSH coalition (headed by Jesse Jackson) to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 1998, citing concerns over a single company controlling two broadcast licenses in the same market in violation of FCC rules. The coalition argued that Glencairn passed itself off as a minority-owned company (Edwards is African American) which, since the Smith family controlled most of the company&#x27;s stock, was technically a Sinclair arm that planned to use the LMA with KOKH to gain control of the station and create an illegal duopoly with KOCB. In 2001, the FCC levied a $40,000 fine against Sinclair for illegally controlling Glencairn. Sinclair became a publicly listed company in 1995, raising $105 million in a June sale of 5 million shares. The Smith family retained a controlling interest.

In 1994, Sinclair signed a deal with Paramount and its UPN network, bringing five affiliates WPTT-TV in Pittsburgh, WNUV-TV in Baltimore, WCGV-TV in Milwaukee, WSTR-TV in Cincinnati and KSMO-TV in Kansas City to the network. In 1996, Sinclair bought out Superior Communications for $63 million. In 1997, Sinclair reached a deal with The WB to convert many of the UPN affiliates to The WB. Following the disputes, in August 1998, Sinclair and UPN signed a new agreement. 

In February 1998, Sinclair bought out Sullivan Broadcasting for $1 billion. In 1998, Sinclair bought out Max Media Properties, for $252 million. In November 2004, Sinclair sold off KSMO-TV in Kansas City to Meredith Corporation for $26.8 million. In December 2004, Sinclair divested KOVR-TV in Sacramento to Viacom, now Paramount Global, for $285 million.

In 2004, as a response when LIN Media signed ABC affiliates WDTN and WAND to NBC, Sinclair Broadcast Group converted two of its NBC affiliates WICS/WICD and WKEF to ABC.

In July 2009, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sinclair stated that if the company could not refinance its $1.33 billion debt, or if Cunningham Broadcasting became insolvent due to nonpayment on a loan worth $33.5 million, Sinclair may be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company seemingly recovered its financial fortunes enough, and began a major string of acquisitions involving television stations and other properties two years later.

====2011–2013====
The beginning of the 2010s saw Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition strategy intensify. In May 2011, Ring of Honor (ROH), a professional wrestling promotion, was purchased for an undisclosed amount. ROH&#x27;s flagship program &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot; was added onto the schedules of many Sinclair-operated stations. In September 2011, Four Points Media Group was purchased for $200 million, equivalent to $ in . Sinclair assumed managerial control of the stations from Nexstar Broadcasting Group. Four Points owner Cerberus Capital Management paid Nexstar cash compensation for the prematurely terminated time brokerage agreements. In November 2011, Sinclair purchased Freedom Communications&#x27; television stations for $385 million, equivalent to $ in , making Sinclair the ninth-largest broadcast group in the United States.

At the same time, Sinclair purchased WWHO, a CW affiliate in the Columbus, Ohio, market, from LIN TV. Owing to Sinclair&#x27;s existing Columbus duopoly of WSYX and WTTE, WWHO was resold to Manhan Media, who entered into a shared services agreement with Sinclair. In May 2012, a groupwide affiliation renewal with Fox reached, included an option for Sinclair to purchase WUTB, Baltimore&#x27;s MyNetworkTV station, from Fox Television Stations before March 31, 2013. Sinclair purchased WUTB and resold it to Deerfield Media—controlled by Manhan Media owner Stephen P. Mumblow—on November 26, 2012, pairing with WBFF and WNUV. Concurrently, Fox had an option to purchase up to any combination of six different MyNetworkTV and CW stations in four different markets from Sinclair, which it declined.

On July 19, 2012, Sinclair acquired six stations from Newport Television, along with existing operational agreements for two other stations, for $412.5 million, equivalent to $ in , as part of a larger dispersal of Newport&#x27;s 22-station portfolio. That same day, Sinclair purchased Tampa station WTTA for $40 million, equivalent to $ in . Two of Sinclair&#x27;s existing stations in markets affected by the Newport deal, WSTR-TV and KMYS, were sold to Deerfield Media. Deerfield also acquired KBTV-TV, Beaumont, Texas&#x27;s Fox affiliate, from Nexstar, with Sinclair assuming operations and merging it into CBS affiliate KFDM. The non-license assets of ABC affiliate WHAM-TV in Rochester, New York, were sold by Newport to Sinclair, with Deerfield purchasing the station&#x27;s license.

In February 2013, Cox Media Group sold five television stations, their smallest by media market rankings, to Sinclair, with Deerfield Media assuming ownership of Cox-operated KAME-TV in Reno. Sinclair purchased Schaumburg, Illinois–based Barrington Broadcasting on February 28, 2013, including six other stations operated by Barrington. The former Cox and Barrington stations are operated through subsidiary Chesapeake Television, focusing on smaller markets and with management separate from Sinclair proper. Two Barrington stations, along with the lease for a third, were initially set to be transferred to Cunningham Broadcasting, but were ultimately sold to an affiliate of Northwest Broadcasting owner Brian Brady.

Prevailing in a bidding war with LIN Media, Sinclair purchased Fisher Communications in April 2013, for $373.3 million, equivalent to $ in , including 20 television stations in the western United States, operational control of one station, and three radio stations in Seattle. This deal returned Sinclair to radio ownership, since the divestment of their radio portfolio between 1999 and 2000. The deal was initially met with financial scrutiny. The law firm Levi &amp; Korsinsky notified Fisher shareholders with accusations that Fisher&#x27;s board of directors were breaching fiduciary duties by &quot;failing to adequately shop the Company before agreeing to enter into the transaction&quot;, and Sinclair was underpaying for Fisher&#x27;s stock. Shortly after the announcement, a lawsuit was filed by a Fisher shareholder. The suit was settled in July 2013 and the merger approved shortly thereafter.

On June 3, 2013, Titan TV Broadcast Group sold four stations, along with operating agreements for two stations, to Sinclair. Prior to the deal, a seventh station, KDBC-TV in El Paso, Texas, to Cunningham, fueling speculation KDBC-TV would be consolidated with Sinclair-owned KFOX-TV. Sinclair exercised its option to purchase KDBC-TV outright citing KDBC-TV&#x27;s fourth-place ranking in the El Paso market while KFOX ranked sixth, making it permissible under FCC duopoly regulations. Dielectric Communications, a key supplier of television broadcasting antennas, was purchased from SPX on June 18, 2013. SPX had intended to close down all of Dielectric&#x27;s operations by the end of July, in turn threatening a FCC-proposed incentive auction and subsequent repacking of television broadcast spectrum.

In July 2013, as part of a refocus on the &quot;Politico&quot; website and newspaper, Allbritton Communications sold their seven station portfolio—including Washington, D.C.&#x27;s WJLA-TV—to Sinclair, for $985 million, equivalent to $ in . This deal was complicated by multiple regulatory hurdles and a proposed barring of future joint sales agreements (JSA) by the FCC. Originally planning to divest four Sinclair-owned stations in three markets with Allbritton stations to Deerfield and Armstrong Williams-controlled Howard Stirk Holdings, and continuing to operate them under JSAs, 

In March 2014, Sinclair announced intentions to divest three stations and one existing LMA to independent third parties. Unable to find a buyer, Sinclair proposed in May 2014, to return to the FCC the licenses for WCFT-TV in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, WJSU-TV in Anniston, Alabama, and WCIV in Charleston, South Carolina, transferring the intellectual properties of those three stations to existing Sinclair-owned stations. One other Allbritton station, WHTM-TV in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, was sold to Media General for $83.4 million (equivalent to $ in ). After nearly a year of delays, the deal was approved by the FCC in July 2014, and completed on August 1. WCIV, WCFT-TV and WJSU-TV were ultimately sold to Howard Stirk Holdings.

In September 2013, Sinclair purchased eight stations owned or operated by New Age Media. As part of the deal, three stations—WSWB in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, WTLH in Tallahassee, Florida, and WNBW-DT in Gainesville, Florida—would be sold by owner MPS Media to Cunningham, with Deerfield purchasing WTLF in Tallahassee. New Age Media and MPS Media terminated the deal on October 31, 2014. Sinclair purchased the non-license assets for all eight stations and began operating them through master service agreements the next day.

====2014–2016====
Sinclair signed an agreement in June 2014 to carry the classic film subchannel network GetTV in 33 markets by the end of September. In July of that year, Sinclair announced the launch of the American Sports Network (ASN) service, operating within its Sinclair Networks company. This service, which produces and distributes college sports broadcasts, is primarily carried on Sinclair stations. ASN was created as part of the company&#x27;s foray into original, non-news content creation beyond Ring of Honor Wrestling and school sports. Subsequently, on August 21, 2014, the company announced the formation of Sinclair Original Programming, a new division concentrating on entertainment and commercial content. The company also announced plans for a future cable news network. The Original Programming division chief operating officer was announced as Arthur Hasson, general manager of Sinclair stations in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. On August 20, 2014, Sinclair announced that it would swap WTTA in Tampa and KXRM-TV and KXTU-LD in Colorado Springs to Media General in exchange for WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island, WLUK-TV and WCWF in Green Bay and WTGS in Savannah, Georgia. The deal was part of Media General&#x27;s merger with LIN Media, the owner of WLUK and WCWF and operator of WTGS at that time, as both Media General and LIN owned stations in the three markets, requiring both companies to sell off stations in conflicting markets due to the FCC&#x27;s recent decision to scrutinize sharing agreements between stations owned by different licensees. The swap was approved by the FCC alongside the Media General-LIN merger on December 12, 2014.

On September 3, 2014, Sinclair announced the purchase of Las Vegas NBC affiliate KSNV-DT from Intermountain West Communications Company for $120 million. As Sinclair already owns a duopoly in Las Vegas (KVMY and KVCW), the company will sell the license assets (though not the programming) of one of the three stations to comply with FCC ownership restrictions, with the divested station&#x27;s programming being relocated to the other stations. The purchase of KSNV&#x27;s non-license assets was completed on November 1, 2014. On September 11, 2014, the license assets of WCIV were sold to Howard Stirk Holdings (pending FCC approval) and aside from sharing studio space with WMMP (which will retain the ABC affiliation and current programming of WCIV), will have no operational control from Sinclair, saving the station from being forfeited back to the FCC. Similar sales were filed with the FCC for WBMA-LD satellite stations WCFT-TV on September 24 and WJSU-TV on September 28. Sinclair continued its push into original programming. Since May 2015, three deals were made to expand American Sports Network beyond college sports. In June, subsidiary Sinclair TV Group, Inc. formed Tornante-Sinclair LLC, a TV production company, with Michael Eisner&#x27;s Tornante Co. With MGM on October 31, 2015, Comet was launched as a sci-fi broadcast subchannel network. On October 12, Sinclair Original Programming and the programming department was merged into Sinclair Programming and moved into Sinclair Television Group.

On October 1, 2015, Gray Television announced that it would acquire WLUC-TV from Sinclair; in return, Sinclair would receive WSBT-TV in South Bend, Indiana, from Gray. The swap, part of Gray&#x27;s acquisition of the broadcasting assets of Schurz Communications (owner of WSBT), was necessary as Gray already owns WNDU-TV in South Bend. The sale was completed on February 16, 2016. 

On January 27, 2016, Sinclair Broadcast Group announced that it would acquire Tennis Channel for $350 million. The channel&#x27;s corporation comes with $200 million in net operating losses that SBGI can use to offset future income thus reducing taxes. Sinclair&#x27;s news operations had launched six drone teams in September 2016. Initial stations getting drone teams were in Washington, Baltimore, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Columbus, Ohio; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Little Rock, Arkansas. In the mid-2010s, Sinclair launched &quot;Refined&quot;, an online local lifestyle web magazine run in conjunction with local Sinclair stations. The third was announced for DC under WJLA-TV. In December 2016, SBG announced TBD, a new digital subchannel network aimed towards millennials, with a focus on digital content. It began broadcasting on February 13, 2017. At the NATPE conference on January 17, 2017, SBG and MGM announced a second TV network, Charge!, a new digital subchannel network focusing on action-adventure based programming. It begin broadcasting on February 28, 2017. Sinclair had two rounds of executive promotions announced in November 2016 and effective January 1, 2017, with chair and CEO David D. Smith moving up to executive chairman while CFO Christopher Ripley becoming president and CEO. In the second round, David Amy was promoted from chief operating officer to vice chairman with responsibility for corporate marketing, human resources and the networks group, while Steven Pruett move from co-COO of Sinclair Television Group to executive vice president and chief TV development officer.

====2017–present====
On March 1, 2017, Sinclair bought Tennis Media Company for $8 million, which includes the Tennis.com website and &quot;Tennis&quot; magazine; the deal also includes up to $6 million in earnout if certain targets are reached. Sinclair intends to integrate the properties with Tennis Channel. On April 21, 2017, following the reinstatement of the &quot;UHF discount&quot; (a policy that counts television stations broadcasting on UHF channels by 50% of their total audience towards the FCC&#x27;s 39% market cap), Sinclair announced its intent to purchase Bonten Media Group for $240 million. The sale was approved on June 30, and the sale was completed September 1.

On May 8, 2017, Sinclair announced its intent to acquire the Chicago-based Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The sale would have given Sinclair ownership of additional stations within the top-10 markets, along with ownership of a stake in Food Network, WGN America, and other additional assets, To comply with Department of Justice antitrust and FCC ownership regulations, it was suggested that Sinclair would have to divest stations in multiple markets.

The concerns about Sinclair potentially creating an oligarchy in the broadcast television industry – alongside Nexstar Media Group, which has a station portfolio of similar size – led public interest groups to attempt to block the purchase by preventing the UHF discount from being reinstated. On June 1, 2017, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals issued a seven-day administrative stay to the UHF discount rulemaking, in order to allow review of an emergency stay motion filed by The Institute for Public Representation (a coalition of public interest groups comprising Free Press, the United Church of Christ, Media Mobilizing Project, the Prometheus Radio Project, the National Hispanic Media Coalition and Common Cause) on May 15. The coalition argued that the UHF discount was no longer logical from a technical standpoint (as stations that transmit on the UHF band have typically maintained better digital signal quality than those transmitting on VHF, a reversal of the technical issues with both bands during the analog era) and would trigger a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the broadcast television industry that would further reduce diversity in station ownership. The D.C. Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion on June 15, 2017, though it is still subject to a pending court proceeding to appeal the UHF discount implementation. On February 21, 2018, Sinclair informed the FCC that it planned to sell off Tribune stations in New York City, Chicago, and San Diego, while seeking waivers to purchase the Tribune stations in Indianapolis, South Central Pennsylvania, and the Piedmont Triad. Sinclair is expected to enter into LMA&#x27;s to operate WPIX and WGN-TV, while selling off KSWB outright. Overlapping stations in Seattle, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Oklahoma City, Grand Rapids, Michigan, Norfolk, Virginia, and Des Moines, Iowa will be sold off to unaffiliated third parties. On July 16, 2018, FCC chairman Ajit Pai was reported to have &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the transaction and proposed a hearing before an administrative law judge. On August 9, 2018, Tribune Media announced that it had terminated the sale agreement with Sinclair, and that it had filed a $1 billion lawsuit against the company for breach of contract. Tribune Media CEO Peter Kern stated that the sale &quot;cannot be completed in an acceptable timeframe, if ever&quot;; the suit cited Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;belligerent and unnecessarily protracted negations&quot; with the Department of Justice and FCC over regulatory negotiations in order to maintain control of stations that it was advised to divest, as well as violations of the sale agreement requiring divestitures of stations to not result in any threats of regulatory scrutiny.

Following the failed acquisition of Tribune Media, Sinclair has mentioned publicly about buying Fox Sports Networks, as well as the stations owned by Cox Media Group. In January 2019, Sinclair launched an OTT multi-channel streaming service Stirr providing free streaming access to local Sinclair station content as well as on-demand shows and films. On February 13, 2019, Sinclair and the Chicago Cubs announced a new regional sports network, Marquee Sports Network, to start in 2020 with exclusive rights to Cubs&#x27; games. On March 9, 2019, Sinclair purchased a minority stake in YES Network. While Sinclair did not bid on the Cox stations, on April 26, 2019, it was reported that Sinclair was the successful bidder for Fox Sports Networks at $10 billion. On August 22, 2019, Sinclair completed the acquisition of FSN and thus FSN is now a wholly owned subsidiary and becoming sisters to Marquee.

On January 27, 2020, Sinclair announced that it would sell WDKY-TV in Lexington, Kentucky, and the non-license assets of KGBT-TV in Harlingen, Texas, to Nexstar Media Group for $60 million, as part of a settlement between the two companies over Sinclair&#x27;s failed acquisition of Tribune Media, which was ultimately acquired by Nexstar. The transaction was completed on September 17, 2020.

On May 7, 2020, the company was fined $48 million to settle investigations related to reports and statements made to the FCC. In August 2020, Sinclair reached a $25 million settlement agreement for its shareholders related to three lawsuits. Of the $25 million, $20.5 million will be paid into a settlement fund.

In November 2020, Sinclair announced that they would sell KBSI in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and WDKA in Paducah, Kentucky, to Standard Media for $28 million, in a transaction that closed in 2021.

In 2021, Sinclair began moving the primary programming from so-called &quot;sidecar&quot; stations with which Sinclair has an LMA, to subchannels of stations Sinclair owns outright, replacing the sidecar stations&#x27; programming with subchannel network (also known as diginet) affiliations on their main signals. On January 1, Fox moved from KFXA in Cedar Rapids, Iowa to KGAN, where its &quot;Fox 28&quot; branding was retained. With a transitional simulcast period from January 1 to February 4, Fox moved from WRGT-TV in Dayton, Ohio to WKEF, where its &quot;Fox 45&quot; branding was retained; although beginning on February 4, WRGT-TV maintained a primary affiliation with non-diginet MyNetworkTV, on April 19, that affiliation also moved to WKEF. With a transitional simulcast period from January 1 to February 1, Fox moved from KBTV-TV in Port Arthur, Texas to KFDM in nearby Beaumont, Texas, where its &quot;Fox 4&quot; branding was retained. With a transitional simulcast period from January 7 to February 3, Fox moved from original Sinclair signee WTTE in Columbus, Ohio to WSYX, where its &quot;Fox 28&quot; branding was retained. On February 1, Fox moved from WVAH-TV in Charleston, West Virginia to WCHS-TV, where its &quot;Fox 11&quot; branding was retained. While in at least one case (Columbus) the move was done due to the transition to ATSC 3.0, there are no explanations for the other stations.

In March 2021 Sinclair laid off 550 employees, which represented about 5% of its workforce, citing the COVID-19 pandemic. On June 2, 2021, it was announced that Sinclair is a Fortune 500 company, with annual revenues of $5.9 billion in 2020, placing it at 465 on the annual listing of the largest U.S. companies. The company has 10,000 employees as of 2021, and acquired an additional office building near its main Hunt Valley headquarters to accommodate an additional 260 employees.

On April 1, 2021, Sinclair anchorman Reed Cowan said that if WE Charity did not pay him $20 million, he would use Sinclair Broadcast Group&#x27;s television platforms to disparage a Canadian charity which builds schools in Africa.

On October 17, 2021, Sinclair was struck by a ransomware attack affecting the internal servers and workstations of its television stations, after the alleged hackers breached the stations&#x27; internal broadcasting systems via an Active Directory domain that interconnected the company&#x27;s corporate and local IT networks. The incident had disrupted some of its office and operational networks (including internal servers, email servers, corporate phone lines, and workstations and news graphics systems at the company&#x27;s stations), and resulted in data being taken from its server network. Many of Sinclair&#x27;s stations saw varying disruptions to programming in the days following the attack; many of its stations were able to produce their newscasts using limited internal resources (while generally being unable to display lower-third and/or full-screen graphics), while a few were forced to preempt them outright for a few days afterward. Many scheduled NFL game telecasts on the 17th were disrupted on its NBC, CBS and Fox affiliates (replaced by a different game feed or by alternative programming). Sinclair also supplied alternative programming feeds to fill airtime on some of the affected stations due to varying difficulties in transmitting and receiving certain syndicated program feeds or to occupy timeslots normally filled by newscasts (mainly from company-owned multicast networks like Stadium and TBD, or via a feed of its syndicated newscast &quot;The National Desk&quot;). Ransomware experts later indicated that the attack was likely linked to Evil Corp., a Russia-based cybergang that was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2019 and had been accused prior to the attack of attempting to rebrand itself to evade the sanctions; the hackers are believed to have disseminated the Macaw ransomware strain (which was also linked to a similar cyberattack that hit Olympus Corporation&#x27;s corporate server network on October 10) within Sinclair&#x27;s servers.

On March 3, 2022, Sinclair announced that they would sell the Ring of Honor wrestling promotion to Tony Khan, who is the principal owner of rival All Elite Wrestling.

In March 2023, it was reported that Sinclair had laid off news employees and reduced the number of newscasts in four markets: KAEF-TV in Eureka, California; WGXA in Macon, Georgia; WEYI-TV/WSMH in Saginaw/Flint, Michigan; and WACH in Columbia, South Carolina. The discontinued newscasts were replaced by airings of &quot;The National Desk&quot;.

On April 3, 2023, Sinclair announced that it would be re-organizing its operations, with the TV broadcasting properties remaining under Sinclair Broadcast Group, while the non-broadcast operations would be placed under Sinclair Ventures. Then, the two companies would be placed under a new holding company, &quot;Sinclair, Inc.&quot;.

In late April 2023, Sinclair announced that starting May 15, it would end all local news broadcasts on stations in five markets: WGFL in Gainesville, Florida; KPTH in Sioux City, Iowa; KPTM in Omaha, Nebraska; WNWO-TV in Toledo, Ohio; and KTVL in Medford, Oregon. These low-rated newscasts were to be replaced by airings of &quot;The National Desk&quot;.
On June 1, 2023, Sinclair announced the closing of its reorganization as a holding company.

In May 2023, Sinclair sold its controlling interest in Stadium to Silver Chalice, Sinclair stating that the network did not have enough viewership for Sinclair to continue funding it; Sinclair will continue to supply some programming.

On October 10, 2023, Sinclair announced that on October 30, 2023, it will convert Stadium&#x27;s over-the-air service into The Nest, a network that will feature reruns of home improvement, true crime, reality and celebrity-driven shows.

On March 13, 2024, Sinclair reached a deal with America&#x27;s Public Television Stations in which Sinclar will offer free hosting for PBS stations on Sinclair stations with ATSC 3.0 signals if said PBS stations have not launched their own. As of February 2025, Nebraska Public Media, WNPT in Nashville, and KNPB in Reno, Nevada have taken up on Sinclair&#x27;s offer.

In May 2024, Sinclair was reportedly considering selling more than 30% of its 185 broadcasting stations, which it later recanted. In January 2025, upon expectations that the FCC will push for deregulation of local television stations under the Trump administration including eliminating the national ownership cap, Sinclair restructured its debt and liquidity in order to prepare for more acquisitions.

==Programming==
Sinclair had experimented with using a centralized news organization called &quot;News Central&quot; that provided prepackaged news segments for distribution to several of the group&#x27;s stations. These segments were integrated into programming during local news broadcasts. Mark Hyman, a high-ranking executive at Sinclair, also created &quot;The Point&quot;, a series of conservative editorial segments that were broadcast on stations operated by the group that maintain news departments.

In October 2015, Sinclair premiered &quot;Full Measure&quot;, a syndicated public affairs program hosted by Sharyl Attkisson.

On July 1, 2017, Sinclair launched a new daily morning kids&#x27; TV block called KidsClick, partnering with This TV. The block was moved to TBD in 2018, and was eventually discontinued 8 months later.

In June 2020, Sinclair announced it would launch &quot;a headline news service&quot; that would air weekday mornings (6:00 AM – 9:00 AM local time) and rely on news-gathering services of Sinclair&#x27;s stations as well as original content, similar in format to &quot;NewsNation&quot; produced by Nexstar Media Group for WGN America. The show, titled &quot;The National Desk&quot;, launched on January 18, 2021, and airs on Sinclair&#x27;s CW and MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations along with its Fox-affiliated stations that do not have their own local morning news shows. On September 27, 2021, &quot;The National Desk&quot; expanded to a two-hour evening newscast, airing 10 pm to midnight Eastern Time.

==Political views==
Sinclair&#x27;s stations have been known for featuring news content and programming that promote conservative political positions. They have been involved in various controversies surrounding politically motivated programming decisions, such as news coverage and specials during the lead-ups to elections that were in support of the Republican Party. 

A 2019 study by Emory University political scientists Gregory J. Martin and Josh McCrain in the &quot;American Political Science Review&quot; found that &quot;stations bought by Sinclair reduce coverage of local politics, increase national coverage and move the ideological tone of coverage in a conservative direction relative to other stations operating in the same market&quot;. A 2021 study found that viewers in areas with a Sinclair TV station had lower approval of President Barack Obama and were less likely to vote for Democratic presidential nominees. A 2023 study found that Sinclair-owned stations aired fewer reports mentioning masks during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their reports were more likely to focus on partisan views of the issue.

The &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted that WJLA-TV&#x27;s news content began to exhibit a conservative slant following Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of the station, including having established a partnership with the conservative &quot;Washington Times&quot; newspaper, while the company produces pieces from a Washington bureau that similarly exhibit a conservative viewpoint. Sinclair executive David Smith met with Donald Trump during the 2016 election year, in which he told the future president, &quot;We are here to deliver your message.&quot; 

In 2004, Sinclair&#x27;s political slant was scrutinized by critics when it was publicized that nearly all of Sinclair&#x27;s recent campaign contributions were to the Republican Party. In particular, the Center for Public Integrity showed concern that the Republican slant of Sinclair&#x27;s news programming, along with Mark Hyman&#x27;s history of government lobbying, such as for the FCC to loosen rules regarding concentration of media ownership—a factor that has assisted in the company&#x27;s growth, made its stations provide &quot;anything but fair and balanced news programming&quot;. Hyman disputed these allegations by stating that its newscasts were &quot;pretty balanced&quot; and that &quot;the reason why some on the left have characterized us as conservative is that we run stories that others in the media spike&quot;.

In 2017, all Sinclair news-producing stations began inserting a waving American flag into the right corner of its lower third news graphics. With the American flag having been seen in recent years as a symbol of conservatism, this was seen by some as a reinforcement of the political slant of Sinclair.

At times, Sinclair has disciplined hosts who have stepped over the line regarding propriety. For example, host Jamie Allman resigned from St. Louis ABC affiliate KDNL in 2018, after a comment he made on his now-cancelled daily news/commentary show &quot;The Allman Report&quot;, in which he said that he was &quot;getting ready to ram a hot poker up [then-17-year-old Parkland shooting survivor-turned-gun control activist] David Hogg&#x27;s ass&quot;.

Sinclair has faced scrutiny from some media critics, as well as some of its station employees, for the conservative slant of their stations&#x27; news reporting and other programming decisions, and how the company&#x27;s rapid growth has aided the airing of content that supports these views. Sinclair has faced criticism over business practices that circumvent concentration of media ownership regulations, particularly the use of local marketing agreements, accusations that the company had been currying favor with the Trump administration in order to loosen these rules and about its management lacking diversity and being totally controlled by a single family. Critics, including former &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; anchor Dan Rather, have described Sinclair&#x27;s practices as being &quot;an assault on our democracy&quot; by disseminating what they perceive to be Orwellian-like propaganda to its local stations.

===Must-run segments===
Sinclair often mandates its stations to air specific reports, segments, programs and editorials, referred to as &quot;must-runs&quot;. The company produces long-form programs airing weekends on its stations, including Armstrong Williams&#x27;s weekly talk show &quot;The Right Side&quot;, and the political/investigative journalism series &quot;Full Measure with Sharyl Attkisson&quot;. The &quot;must-run&quot; practice has been criticized by news staff at some of Sinclair&#x27;s stations due to the viewpoints they propagate. In 1996, after CEO David Smith was arrested in a prostitution sting, he ordered Sinclair&#x27;s Baltimore station WBFF to produce reports on a local drug counseling program as part of his community service sentence. The order was criticized by WBFF reporter LuAnne Canipe. 

Following the September 11 attacks, Sinclair ordered its stations to read editorials in support of President George W. Bush&#x27;s response to the attack. &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that WBFF staff internally objected to the editorial, as they felt that the endorsement would &quot;undermine public faith in their political objectivity&quot;. The station, however, complied with the mandate.

Newsroom employees of KOMO-TV in Seattle told &quot;The New York Times&quot; they felt the national pieces were low quality, and were too politically skewed for the city&#x27;s progressive audience. One employee admitted they had tried to reduce their prominence by deliberately scheduling them during lesser-viewed portions of newscasts, such as around commercial breaks, in an act of malicious compliance with Sinclair&#x27;s must-run rules. However, in March 2018, KOMO aired a must-run segment during prime time about some Americans&#x27; belief in the existence of a deep state in the federal government, a concept Trump has blamed for undermining his presidency.

In April 2017, Sinclair announced it had hired Boris Epshteyn, who was briefly the White House assistant communications director for surrogate operations for the Trump administration, and a senior advisor of Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, as chief political analyst. All Sinclair stations were required to air Ephsteyn&#x27;s commentary, &quot;Bottom Line with Boris&quot; nine times per week.

In July 2017, the HBO news satire program &quot;Last Week Tonight&quot; devoted a segment to discussing Sinclair&#x27;s editorial practices, in which host John Oliver presented clips of various anchors from stations run by the company, using an identical script describing the FBI as having a &quot;personal vendetta&quot; against Michael Flynn, clips of Mark Hyman editorials, in which he compared multiculturalism and political correctness to a cancer epidemic, and stated that marriage was a solution to domestic abuse, and joked that the &quot;Terrorism Alert Desk&quot; segments defined terrorism as &quot;anything a Muslim does&quot;. Oliver felt that it was inappropriate for local newscasts to advance political positions. 

Oliver pointed out, as an example, the fact that Sinclair&#x27;s &quot;Terrorism Alert Desk&quot; reported in 2016 that Islamic State militia in Iraq had killed nine youth by slashing them in half with chainsaws. Such news originated from an anonymous-sourced report published by &quot;Iraqi News&quot;, lacking any confirmation from independent outlets and was treated with extreme caution even by British tabloids such as the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; and by far-right website &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, leading Oliver to ironically remark that he did not know it was possible to &quot;dip beneath the journalistic standards of &quot;Breitbart&quot;&quot;.

The must-run segments usually only apply to those stations that have their own news department. For Sinclair stations where the newscast is operated by an external newsroom, the contracts generally forbid Sinclair from interfering with editorial control.

On December 11, 2019, it was reported that Sinclair had dropped Epshteyn&#x27;s commentary segments, with plans to encourage stations to prioritize local investigative journalism and coverage of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.

In June 2024, dozens of Sinclair local newscast anchors delivered an identical or nearly identical introduction to a recorded story by a Sinclair national correspondent. The story related to a recent &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; article that called into question the mental acuity of Democratic president and reelection candidate Joe Biden. The Sinclair report did not mention that the &quot;Journal&quot; story had been criticized by prominent media critics for alleged lack of balance in its sourcing, including its heavy reliance on anonymous Republican sources.

===&quot;Nightline&quot; reading of the names===
In April 2004, ABC broadcast a special episode of &quot;Nightline&quot; where host Ted Koppel listed the names of soldiers killed in the 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq. Sinclair ordered its seven ABC affiliates not to air the episode. The company claimed the broadcast &quot;[appeared] to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq&quot;, and undermined a then-ongoing effort by its Washington bureau to report on positive, &quot;untold&quot; stories from Iraq under occupation that were being ignored by mainstream media outlets. ABC stated that the segment was meant to be &quot;an expression of respect which seeks to honor those who have laid down their lives for this country&quot;.

===&quot;Stolen Honor&quot; documentary===
Later in October 2004, just two weeks prior to the 2004 presidential election, it was reported that all 62 of Sinclair&#x27;s stations would preempt prime time programming to air &quot;Stolen Honor: Wounds That Never Heal&quot;, a documentary critical of U.S. presidential candidate John Kerry&#x27;s anti-Vietnam War activism. The film was produced by Carlton Sherwood, a former associate of Tom Ridge, and accused Kerry of prolonging the Vietnam War because of his anti-war activism. The organization Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an anti-Kerry organization in the 2004 election year, was cross-promoting the film as part of a $1.4 million advertising campaign. 

In response, the Democratic National Committee filed a legal motion with the Federal Election Commission stating that it is inappropriate for the media organization to air &quot;partisan propaganda&quot; in the last 10 days of an election campaign. As this controversy made the news, with a number of Sinclair advertisers pulling their ads and Sinclair stock dropping 17% in eleven days, Sinclair announced that it had never intended to air &quot;Stolen Honor&quot; in an hour slot in the first place, indicating that it might instead show clips of the video in a discussion panel format. Ultimately, Sinclair did not broadcast any such show. Following the incident, Sinclair fired its Washington bureau chief Jon Lieberman for publicly criticizing the film in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; as &quot;biased political propaganda&quot;.

===&quot;Breaking Point&quot; infomercial===
In November 2010, it was reported that five Fox affiliates and one ABC affiliate owned by Sinclair broadcast an infomercial critical of then-President Barack Obama, &quot;Breaking Point: 25 Minutes that will Change America&quot;, which was sponsored by the National Republican Trust Political Action Group. The infomercial painted Obama as an extremist, and claimed that, during the 2008 presidential campaign, he received some campaign money from the Hamas terrorist group, and that Obama said in a speech, &quot;You want freedom? You&#x27;re gonna have to kill some crackers! You gonna have to kill some of those babies.&quot;

The special discussed Obama advisers Van Jones and John Holdren, as well as Obama staff Anita Dunn, Kevin Jennings, Carol Browner and Cass Sunstein – all in an unflattering light. In one case, the special claimed that Holdren said that trees should be permitted to sue humans in court. The infomercial aired at various times during the weekend of October 30, 2010, on Sinclair-owned stations in Madison, Cape Girardeau, Lexington, Pittsburgh, Des Moines, and Winston-Salem – all in swing states vital to the 2010 elections.

===2012 pre-election special===
On November 5, 2012, six Sinclair stations in swing states aired a special focusing on issues surrounding the presidential election occurring the next day, such as the Libyan civil war and health care reform; the special consisted of a series of segments which were presented by the local anchors at each station. While scheduling of the special was at the discretion of each station, Columbus, Ohio ABC affiliate WSYX pre-empted both &quot;ABC World News&quot; and &quot;Nightline&quot; to air it. The special was met with controversy for showing a bias against Obama and focusing little on Republican candidate Mitt Romney, as opposed to showcasing both candidates equally. A Sinclair staff member disputed these claims, stating that &quot;no one is disputing the facts of the stories that aired in the special&quot;, and that its decision on which markets to air the special was influenced by their &quot;news value&quot; and resonation with the public.

===Coverage during the 2016 presidential election campaign===
On December 16, 2016, Jared Kushner, son-in-law of then-President-elect Donald Trump, stated that he had reached deals with Sinclair to give the company extended access to the Trump campaign, in exchange for airing, without further commentary, interviews with the Republican Party candidate on its stations, which Kushner said had a better reach than cable networks such as CNN. 

Sinclair VP of news Scott Livingston stated that the company wanted to &quot;give all candidates an opportunity to voice their position and share their position with our viewers&quot;, as part of an effort towards &quot;tracking the truth and telling the truth&quot; and allowing Trump to &quot;clearly state his position on the key issues&quot;. He stated that Sinclair had made similar offers to the Hillary Clinton campaign. Clinton did not accept offers to do interviews with Sinclair, according to Livingston, though her running mate, Tim Kaine, did. A spokesperson for the Trump campaign stated that the deal did not involve monetary compensation, and that it had attempted to make similar deals with other local station groups such as Hearst Television.

A December 22, 2016 &quot;Washington Post&quot; review of Sinclair&#x27;s internal documents, as well as reviews of the newscasts and public affairs programming on the company&#x27;s stations, revealed that more broadcast time was given to favorable or neutral coverage of Trump&#x27;s campaign than to other candidates in the primary and general election campaigns of 2016. The coverage included distribution of reports favorable to Trump&#x27;s campaign or challenging to Clinton&#x27;s on a &quot;must-run&quot; basis, as well as Sinclair managers offering local reporters and anchors questions of &quot;national importance&quot; to use in interviews with candidates, a common company practice, according to Livingston, so that other Sinclair stations can share the content.

In May 2017, in response to Sinclair&#x27;s announced intent to acquire Tribune Media, Craig Aaron, president/CEO of media advocacy group Free Press, accused Sinclair of currying favor with the Trump administration through the interview arrangement with Trump, the group&#x27;s February hiring of former Trump campaign aide Boris Epshteyn as a political analyst, and executive chair David Smith&#x27;s meetings with then-FCC commissioner Ajit Pai prior to his appointment as the agency&#x27;s chair in exchange for deregulating media ownership rules to allow the company to expand its broadcasting portfolio.

===2018 journalistic responsibility promos===
In March 2018, CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter obtained an internal memorandum sent by Sinclair, which dictated that its stations must produce and broadcast an &quot;anchor-delivered journalistic responsibility message&quot; using a mandated script. The promos contain language decrying &quot;biased and false news&quot;, and accusing unnamed mainstream media figures of bias. Stelter stated that the script is written to sound like the opinion of the local anchors, despite the text being in fact a mandate from corporate management. At least 66 Sinclair-owned stations produced their own version of the message, with the first being aired on March 23, 2018. Sinclair-owned WMSN-TV refused to air the message, although its news is produced by Morgan Murphy Media-owned WISC-TV.

The promos began to receive mainstream media attention after the sports blog &quot;Deadspin&quot;, as well as &quot;ThinkProgress&quot;, posted video compilations featuring all of the promos being played simultaneously. The promos have been criticized as in regard to the greater political context of &quot;fake news&quot; in the media for media bashing, comparing it to the rhetoric of Donald Trump in regard to these topics. Sinclair maintains that its &quot;must-runs&quot; are standard procedure, often covering a wide variety of issues such as news updates regarding terrorism and other public matters on which the company has an opinion while remaining &quot;committed to reporting the facts&quot;. After the compilations went viral, Trump responded to the promos on April 2, 2018, defending the company as being &quot;far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke&quot;.

The instructions for the mandated promos tell an anchor to state:

I&#x27;m extremely proud of the quality, balanced journalism that [proper news brand name of local station] produces. But I&#x27;m concerned about the troubling trend of irresponsible, one-sided news stories plaguing our country. The sharing of biased and false news has become all too common on social media. More alarming, national media outlets are publishing these same fake stories without checking facts first. Unfortunately, some members of the national media are using their platforms to push their own personal bias and agenda to control &#x27;exactly what people think.&#x27; This is extremely dangerous to our democracy... We understand Truth is neither politically &#x27;left or right.&#x27; Our commitment to factual reporting is the foundation of our credibility, now more than ever.

On April 2, 2018, Sinclair Broadcast Group released a statement on their website in response to what it called &quot;unfounded media criticism&quot;. The statement cited a Monmouth University poll that found large majorities of Americans believe that traditional news media outlets report fake news. Sinclair maintains that the promos &quot;served no political agenda&quot;. Sinclair responded by posting a video on its website that attacked CNN for &quot;dishonesty and hypocrisy&quot; in their coverage of the Sinclair must-run promo; Sinclair equated Stelter&#x27;s warnings about &quot;fake news&quot; as similar to Sinclair&#x27;s warnings in its must-run promo.

Several outlets called for an advertiser boycott of Sinclair-owned stations. A report in &quot;Advertising Age&quot; magazine suggested that a boycott would not be easy, since it involves users first identifying the station as a Sinclair station, and then figuring out which advertisers are putting commercials on that station, and then discouraging those advertisers.

===Arab–Israeli conflict===
In addition to above, Sinclair has also supported Israel describing it as a &quot;true democracy of the Middle East&quot;.

Professional wrestler David Starr has criticized the company due to Ring of Honor holding an event in Israel where Starr was involved in a match against Jay Lethal and Matt Sydal on April 21, 2019, amid a fan boycott. The video was removed due to allegations of antisemitism.

===Judy Mikovits interview===
In July 2020, Sinclair Broadcast Group scheduled to air an interview of &quot;Plandemic&quot; creator Judy Mikovits and her lawyer Larry Klayman, conducted by Eric Bolling on the &quot;America This Week&quot; show. During the interview, Mikovits was introduced by Bolling as an &quot;expert in virology&quot;. She put forth a baseless claim that American health official Anthony Fauci created the COVID-19 virus and sent it to China. Bolling did not argue against Mikovits&#x27; allegation or fact-check it on-air, although he claimed that he had argued against Mikovits by calling her allegation &quot;hefty&quot;. Sinclair Broadcast Group distributed the interview to its local stations, and released the interview online, with an on-screen graphic of &quot;Did Dr. Fauci create COVID-19?&quot; After media reports regarding the interview emerged, Sinclair received substantial criticism, resulting in Sinclair canceling televised broadcast and removing the video from Sinclair-affiliated websites.

==Retransmission disputes==
===Suddenlink===
In the summer of 2006, Charter Communications streamlined its operations, which included selling off portions of the cable system&#x27;s service franchises that it considered to be &quot;geographically non-strategic&quot;. Charter&#x27;s Huntington-Charleston, West Virginia franchise was purchased by Suddenlink Communications. Sinclair requested a $40 million one-time fee, and a $1-per subscription per month fee from Suddenlink for retransmission rights of both ABC affiliate WCHS-TV and Fox affiliate WVAH-TV on the Suddenlink cable system. This led to a protracted media battle and smear campaign between the two companies, and Sinclair pulled the two stations off of Charter&#x27;s systems in the neighboring Beckley, West Virginia market. After several weeks of negotiations, the two companies reached an agreement which allowed WCHS-TV and WVAH-TV to continue transmission over the Suddenlink cable system. The terms of the agreement were not released to the public.

===Mediacom===
Mediacom filed an antitrust lawsuit against Sinclair in October 2006, claiming that the group insisted on blanket carriage of 22 Sinclair-owned/managed stations across Mediacom-operated service areas, where Sinclair operates a television station regardless of market differences. The District Court for the Southern District of Iowa denied Mediacom&#x27;s injunction motion on October 24. The cable provider filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, but dropped the request on December 13. Sinclair&#x27;s retransmission agreement with Mediacom was originally set to expire on December 1, 2006, but the group later extended the deadline to January 5, 2007.

Despite the extension, the two sides remained at an impasse over how much money Mediacom should pay Sinclair for carriage of its stations. On January 4, the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s Media Bureau denied Mediacom&#x27;s complaint, stating that Sinclair failed to negotiate with Mediacom in good faith. After failing to respond to Mediacom&#x27;s offer to take the dispute to binding arbitration before the deadline, Sinclair pulled all 22 stations from Mediacom&#x27;s lineups shortly after midnight on January 6.

Despite a plea from Iowa&#x27;s Congressional delegation urging the two sides to submit to binding arbitration, Sinclair rejected the plea on January 11. The two sides discussed the dispute in front of Iowa lawmakers on January 23. On January 30, 2007, Senators Daniel Inouye, chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and Ranking Member Ted Stevens signed a letter addressed to FCC chairman Kevin Martin. 

The impasse ended on February 2 when Mediacom announced that it had reached a retransmission agreement with Sinclair for undisclosed terms. All 22 stations were restored to Mediacom systems shortly after the agreement was announced. Mediacom lost 14,000 subscribers during the last quarter of 2006 and an additional 18,000 subscribers during the first quarter of 2007.

In December 2009, Sinclair announced that it would pull all of its stations from Mediacom systems for the second time in three years if a new carriage agreement was not reached by midnight on December 31. The impasse had threatened coverage of the January 5 Orange Bowl in Iowa, where the Hawkeyes played, and the January 7, 2010 BCS National Championship Game in Alabama. Mediacom and lawmakers from Iowa and Alabama asked the FCC to intervene. On December 31, Mediacom and Sinclair agreed to an eight-day extension of the retransmission agreement that permitted Sinclair&#x27;s stations to remain on Mediacom until January 8. Both sides reached a one-year retransmission agreement on January 7, one day before the interim agreement was set to expire.

===Time Warner Cable===
Sinclair was involved with retransmission negotiations with Time Warner Cable at the same time as the Mediacom dispute in 2006 and 2007. The two sides reached an agreement on January 19, 2007.

In November 2010, Sinclair announced that it would pull 33 of its stations in 21 cities from Time Warner Cable on January 1, 2011, if the two parties did not come to an agreement. The deadline was extended to January 14, 2011. Regardless of the outcome, Time Warner Cable was obligated to carry Fox network programming on its systems due to a deal reached with the network earlier in 2010. The agreement did not extend to syndicated and locally produced programs on Sinclair&#x27;s Fox affiliates. The two companies reached an agreement on January 15, 2011, shortly after the deadline was extended by another 24 hours.

===Comcast===
In a January 5, 2007, article, &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; reported that Sinclair might pull 30 stations from Comcast systems after its retransmission agreement was slated to expire on February 5. Comcast was granted an extension to March 1, and again to March 10. Comcast stated that it would not pay cash for retransmission rights, but was willing to barter, for example, promoting Sinclair stations on cable channels carried by Comcast devoid of any advertising payments by the company. On March 9, Comcast and Sinclair jointly announced a four-year deal for retransmission rights, expiring on March 1, 2011.

Sinclair and Comcast came to a new agreement for continued carriage on March 3, 2011; this agreement was negotiated without any public statements or announcements.

===Dish Network===
Dish Network&#x27;s retransmission agreement with Sinclair Broadcast Group was slated to expire on August 13, 2012. If an agreement had not reached by that time, 74 Sinclair stations would have been blacked out, including the affiliates of three of the major networks. A representative for Dish Network stated that Sinclair is &quot;seeking a massive price increase that would force Dish to pay more to carry Sinclair&#x27;s stations than it pays to any other broadcaster&quot;. A Sinclair representative, meanwhile, stated that it &quot;believes significant doubt exists as to whether or not a new agreement will be reached with Dish&quot;. Dish Network subsequently set up its own website regarding the dispute. Dish and Sinclair came to an agreement on August 16, averting the removal of its any of the group&#x27;s stations.

On August 25, 2015, ten days after the 2012 retransmission agreement had expired, Dish customers lost access to 129 Sinclair stations, resulting in the largest local television blackout in history.

===DirecTV===
DirecTV&#x27;s retransmission agreement with Sinclair was slated to expire on February 28, 2013. If an agreement had not been reached by that date, 87 Sinclair stations would have been blacked out by the satellite provider. Representatives for Sinclair noted that they &quot;...have been negotiating for quite some time in an effort to reach a new agreement, at this time it does not appear that these efforts will be successful. Although Sinclair does not believe that it is constructive to negotiate its private business relationships in public, Sinclair is informing the public in advance of the end of carriage because it is aware of the impact on a segment of the public from the end of the relationship between the Sinclair stations and DirecTV.&quot; DirecTV stated &quot;we will compensate Sinclair fairly, but our customers should not be forced to pay more than twice as much for the same programs that remain available completely free of charge over the air and online.&quot; A new carriage agreement was reached between Sinclair and DirecTV on February 28, hours before the previous deal was to have expired.

===Hulu with Live TV===
On March 7, 2023, the Walt Disney Company began notifying subscribers of its Hulu with Live TV service that it would drop several ABC affiliate stations after failing to reach an agreement with the owner of those broadcast outlets. The stations were removed from Hulu the following day. It later emerged through media reports that the stations were owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group, and that a retransmission consent agreement between the two companies had lapsed before a new agreement could be reached. In a statement sent to reporters, a spokesperson for Sinclair said they were surprised by the decision to drop the channels and urged Disney to return to the negotiating table.

==Sinclair stations==
Most of the television stations run by Sinclair are owned by the company outright. However, the company operates many others through either a local marketing agreements or shared services agreements. The company&#x27;s stations are affiliates of various television networks, like ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox.

Sinclair also owned or managed several affiliates of the WB and UPN networks, which both launched in January 1995. In September 2006, The WB and UPN merged their operations into a new network, The CW. Eight of Sinclair&#x27;s WB stations, along with independent station KFBT (now KVCW) in Las Vegas, became affiliates of the new network. At the same time, Sinclair aligned 17 of its stations (ten former WB affiliates, six former UPN stations, and independent WFGX) with MyNetworkTV, a programming service owned by Fox&#x27;s parent News Corporation. 

Sinclair&#x27;s relationship with Fox/News Corporation was strengthened after Sinclair agreed to a six-year affiliation renewal for its 19 Fox-affiliated stations. The deal included flagship WBFF in Baltimore, despite Fox already owning a station in that same market, MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WUTB. IN 2012, Sinclair purchased WUTB outright.

===Chesapeake Television===
Chesapeake Television is a subsidiary of Sinclair Broadcast Group that owns television stations in smaller markets. Chesapeake was founded in 2013, to acquire small-market stations purchased through Sinclair&#x27;s run of acquisitions.

As early as January 2013, Sinclair was looking at forming a new subsidiary group for its smaller-market stations. With the February 2013 announcement of the company&#x27;s purchase of Barrington Broadcasting, Sinclair announced the formation of a subsidiary for this purpose, Chesapeake Television, to be headed by Steve Pruett, former CEO of Communications Corporation of America and the current chairman of the Fox network&#x27;s affiliate board. The four stations, as well as a fifth acquired through an LMA, that Sinclair purchased from Cox Media Group and the Barrington stations formed the initial nuclei of the group.

* FanDuel Sports Network – Regional Networks formerly known as Fox Sports Networks. Sinclair formerly owned the regional sports networks via subsidiary Main Street Sports Group, a former joint venture with Allen Media Group. Main Street Sports Group was formerly known as Diamond Sports Group. Fox Sports&#x27; regional sports networks were acquired following Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox&#x27;s entertainment assets. On March 31, 2021, the Fox Sports Networks were rebranded as Bally Sports. On October 21, 2024, the network was rebranded as FanDuel Sports Network. Sinclair&#x27;s equity stake in Diamond Sports Group was extinguished in Diamond Sports Group&#x27;s bankruptcy, with the new equity holders being its former creditors.
** The FanDuel Sports Network app. 
** YES Network (2019) regional sports network acquired in 2019 alongside the Amazon and Yankee Global Enterprises. Yankee Global Enterprises is the majority owner; Amazon and Main Street Sports Group hold minority stakes. Sinclair used to hold a minority stake through its former subsidiary Diamond Sports Group, but lost that stake when its equity stake in Diamond Sports Group was extinguished in the Diamond Sports Group&#x27;s bankruptcy case.
* Ring of Honor (ROH), a professional wrestling promotion that was acquired by Sinclair in 2011. Sinclair sold the promotion&#x27;s assets, video library, and other intellectual property to Tony Khan, through its subsidiary ROH Acquisition Co, LLC in 2022.
** Honor Club (2018-2022), a streaming service that was launched on February 19, 2018.
* Stadium (2014-2023), a sports programming distributor and internet network launched originally as American Sports Network on July 17, 2014, and rebranded to &quot;Stadium&quot; on August 21, 2017. The service was sold in 2023 to Silver Chalice.
** Stadium College Sports (2001-2023) digital cable networks SCS Atlantic, SCS Central, and SCS Pacific.
*Stirr (2019-2024) is a free, ad-supported streaming service launched on January 16, 2019, and drew on programming from the Sinclair TV stations and other streaming live channels. Some programs were available on demand. Its main channel was Stirr City, which pulled content based on the user&#x27;s selected location. When network programming ran on its local channel, Stirr City provided alternative programming. Sinclair sold the service in 2024, resulting in it losing its live-streaming functionality and access to Sinclair content and becoming strictly an On Demand service.

==Affiliated companies==
The companies listed below are separate corporations, effectively shell companies, formed to hold the licensed assets of television stations, where SBG would run afoul of FCC ownership regulations. Sinclair then signs local marketing agreements to actually control, operate, and program the stations, with the purposes of the shell merely to answer to the FCC and public about license matters, often with Sinclair&#x27;s explicit input, unless so restricted by individual regulations against a station. Such arrangements are termed &quot;sidecar agreements&quot; by the FCC. The companies include, in addition to those mentioned in some detail below:
* Deerfield Media
* Howard Stirk Holdings is a licensing holding company formed to acquire certain television stations formerly owned by Barrington Broadcasting. It is owned by Armstrong Williams, founder and CEO of communications firm The Graham Williams Group.
* Mercury Broadcasting Company – a company based in San Antonio, Texas that previously maintained local marketing agreements for its two stations with other companies; Sinclair took over the agreements for the stations in 2013. Sinclair purchased one of them outright, while its Wichita station KMTW remains under Mercury ownership, albeit operated by Sinclair under an LMA.

In 2021, Sinclair began to consolidate the major network affiliations on the DT1 channels held by Deerfield, HSH, Mercury and Cunningham stations onto the DT2 or DT3 subchannels of sister stations directly owned by Sinclair, effectively leaving many of the shell companies&#x27; stations to carry only subchannel networks, also known as diginets.

===Cunningham Broadcasting===
Cunningham Broadcasting, formerly known as Glencairn Ltd., is a station holding company affiliated with Sinclair Broadcast Group via a relationship with the company&#x27;s owners. Per a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cunningham is owned by the estate of Carolyn Beth Cunningham Smith (from whom the company derived its name), the estate of Sinclair&#x27;s controlling shareholders&#x27; parent, and trusts for the children of Sinclair&#x27;s controlling shareholders. All but one, (WYZZ-TV, managed by Nexstar) of Cunningham stations have local marketing agreements with Sinclair-owned/managed stations. Glencairn/Cunningham, based on ownership and agreements, has served merely as a shell corporation.

<text>The koklass pheasant (Pucrasia macrolopha) is a species of gamebird, being closely related to progenitive grouse that lived during the Miocene. They are distantly related to pheasants and are most closely related to grouse and turkeys. Koklass are the only species in the monotypic genus Pucrasia. Both the words &quot;koklass&quot; and &quot;pucrasia&quot; have been onomatopœically derived from the bird&#x27;s territorial call.

Koklass are boreal adapted species which separate into three distinct species groups. They are one of the few gamebirds that regularly fly uphill and are capable of sustained flights of many miles. They are monogamous with a slight tendency toward social polyandry. Both parents rear the chicks. Koklass are largely vegetarian for much of the year consuming pine nuts, pine shoots, bamboo shoots and seeds. They are highly insectivorous during the warmer months that coincide with nesting and chick-rearing. During this phase of their life cycle they live almost exclusively on ants but also are documented consuming catkins, pollen and fruit.
The koklass pheasant is a polytypic species, with nine recognized subspecies:

* Kashmir koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. biddulphi&quot; 
* Western koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. castanea&quot; 
* Darwin&#x27;s koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. darwini&quot; 
* Joret&#x27;s koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. joretiana&quot; 
* Indian koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. macrolopha&quot; 
* Meyer&#x27;s koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. meyeri&quot; 
* Nepal koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. nipalensis&quot; 
* Orange-collared koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. ruficollis&quot; 
* Yellow-necked koklass pheasant - &quot;P. m. xanthospila&quot; 

This entry deals with the subspecies &quot;P. m. biddulphi&quot;, which ranges from Kashmir to Kullu in India. With exception of the subspecies &quot;P. m. nipalensis&quot;, &quot;P. m. castanea&quot; and &quot;P. m. macrolopha&quot;, which are endemic to the southern side of northwest and western Himalaya, the other five are confined to China and Mongolia.

The koklass pheasant is a medium-sized elusive bird confined to high altitude forests from Afghanistan to central Nepal, and in northeastern Tibet to northern and eastern China. Upper parts of male koklass pheasant are covered with silver-grey plumage streaked velvety-black down the centre of each feather, and it has the unique feature of a black head, chestnut breast and prominent white patches on the sides of neck. The females differ from males in above characters and instead their upper parts are covered with pale brown plumage. Both sexes, however, have distinct elongated tails tipped with pale feathers. The males are known to weigh about 1135–1415 g and the females, about 1025–1135 g, with the body length varying from 58 to 64 cm and 18–22 cm respectively. Immature and juveniles resemble adult females in plumage pattern.

Like the western tragopan, it does not extend its range above the tree line. One of the less colourful pheasants, the koklass exhibits moderate sexual dimorphism. Though they skulk under bushes, which makes direct sighting difficult, they give loud chorus/predawn calls during the breeding season and during autumn, revealing their presence and allowing the populations to be estimated. They remain in pairs or small family groups throughout the year. They nest on the ground and spend the nights roosting on trees, or under rock overhangs.

<text>Division 1, Newfoundland and Labrador is a census division covering the entire Avalon Peninsula including the Isthmus of Avalon of the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Like all census divisions in Newfoundland and Labrador, but unlike the census divisions of some other provinces, the division exists only as a statistical division for census data, and is not a political entity.

The area has the largest population of the province, totaling 270,348 – 52% of the provincial total – in 2016. The total land area is 9,220.61 square kilometres. The coast of the Avalon Peninsula is characterized by four main bays and a number of smaller bays. The four main bays are; Trinity Bay, Conception Bay, St. Mary&#x27;s Bay and Placentia Bay. The largest bay is Placentia Bay.

St. John&#x27;s, the capital of the province, is located in this division along with the second largest of the three cities of the province, Mount Pearl. The majority of the towns and villages are located along the coast in much of the four main bays as mentioned.

<doc id="627727" wikidata="Q1145335" url="?curid=627727" title="Dufferin County">
<text>Dufferin County is a county and census division located in Central Ontario, Canada. The county seat is Orangeville, and the current Warden is Janet Horner. The current chief administrative officer is Sonya Pritchard. Dufferin covers an area of , and its population was 66,257 at the time of the 2021 Census.

==History==
It was originally organized as the &quot;Provisional County of Dufferin&quot;, with preparatory work authorized by the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in 1875 and the actual formation taking effect in 1881, being created from parts of the counties of Grey and Simcoe, on the north and east, and from the County of Wellington on the south and west.

The Village of Grand Valley was erected from East Luther in 1897, and the two municipalities amalgamated in 1995 to form the Township of East Luther Grand Valley, which was erected into the Town of Grand Valley in 2012.

The county gets its name from Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, who was Governor General of Canada between 1872-1878. Originally an agriculturally based economy, Dufferin&#x27;s economy has diversified to include commercial and retail businesses, industries related to residential and commercial construction (building, supplies, aggregates, real estate) and manufacturing. A portion of Dufferin’s economy still depends on agriculture but tourism is becoming more important as the county takes a more positive role in attracting visitors.

==Geography==

Dufferin County is the highest plateau immediately south of Georgian Bay, and as such forms the watershed divide between the four lakes: Huron, Erie, Ontario and Simcoe. Four rivers — Saugeen, Grand, Credit and Nottawasaga — take their rise in Dufferin or in adjacent townships and drain through the county.

The county is a lofty table-land that is about above sea-level and about above the level of downtown Toronto. A continuation of the Caledon Mountains skirts the eastern side of the county. The highest peaks, however, are no match for the Blue Mountains north of Dufferin or the Caledon Mountains on the south.

The County of Dufferin, sits on the fringe of the Greater Toronto Area, about northwest of Toronto. It is largely a rural county with three urban settlement areas, namely Grand Valley, Orangeville and Shelburne. The Town of Orangeville, the county seat, is situated on the southern border of the county and is the largest urban centre, with just over half the population. Although Orangeville dominates in terms of population, in area it is very small and geographically compact.

===Climate===

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Dufferin County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Education==

Upper Grand District School Board operates secular Anglophone public schools. The Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board operates Anglophone Catholic public schools. The &quot;Conseil scolaire Viamonde&quot; operates secular Francophone schools serving the area. The &quot;Conseil scolaire de district catholique Centre-Sud&quot; (CSDCCS) operates Catholic Francophone schools serving the area.

==Travel region==
Dufferin County is part of two Ontario travel regions. Headwaters Tourism Association represents the county and the adjacent municipalities of Caledon and Erin. Central Counties of Ontario combines the Headwaters area and a larger adjacent region.

<doc id="627731" wikidata="Q76525" url="?curid=627731" title="Günter Verheugen">
<text>Günter Verheugen (; born 28 April 1944) is a German politician who served as European Commissioner for Enlargement from 1999 to 2004, and then as European Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry from 2004 to 2010. He was also one of five vice presidents of the 27-member Barroso Commission (Barroso I). After his retirement, he is now honorary Professor at the European University Viadrina in Frankfurt (Oder).

==Early life and education==
Born at Bad Kreuznach in Rhineland-Palatinate, Verheugen studied history, sociology and political science at the University of Cologne and at the University of Bonn.

== Political career ==
Verheugen was Secretary General of the Free Democratic Party of Germany (FDP) from 1978 to 1982, under the leadership of the party&#x27;s chairman Hans-Dietrich Genscher. He left the FDP with many left liberal party members in 1982, because the FDP left the government of Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. In the same year, he joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).

=== Member of Parliament, 1983–1999 ===

In the 1983 Western German elections, Verheugen became a member of the German Bundestag. He was a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1983 to 1998. In the early 1980s, Verheugen mapped out a principled policy towards South Africa&#x27;s apartheid regime, embarrassing many of Germany&#x27;s major companies, including Mercedes-Benz and Deutsche Bank, by exposing their efforts to get round international sanctions in a book published in 1986.

From 1994 to 1997, Verheugen was deputy chairman of the SPD parliamentary group, under the leadership of the group&#x27;s chairman Rudolf Scharping. In addition to his parliamentary work, he chaired the Broadcasting Council of &quot;Deutsche Welle&quot; from 1994 until 1998.

Ahead of the 1994 elections, Scharping included Verheugen in his shadow cabinet for the party&#x27;s campaign to unseat incumbent Helmut Kohl as Chancellor. Within Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s campaign team for the 1998 federal elections, he served as his external affairs advisor and accompanied him on his trips to Washington and Warsaw.

=== Minister of State for European Affairs, 1998–1999 ===
In the first cabinet of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Verheugen briefly served as Minister of State in the Federal Foreign Office under Minister Joschka Fischer. During Germany&#x27;s presidency of the Council of the European Union in 1999, he led the negotiations on the Agenda 2000 package of EU policy reforms. Shortly after, he was in talks to be nominated as Germany&#x27;s candidate for the European Union&#x27;s newly created High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy; the post eventually went to Javier Solana. In 1999, he left parliament and became EU commissioner for Enlargement of the European Union.

=== Member of the European Commission, 1999–2010 ===
Nominated by the German government of Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Verheugen first served in the European Commission as European Commissioner for Enlargement in the Prodi Commission, presiding over the accession of ten new member states in 2004. He continued in the following Barroso Commission as Commissioner for Enterprise and Industry, also being promoted to one of the five vice presidents.

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the Élysée Treaty in 2003, the EU Commissioners of Germany and France, Verheugen and Pascal Lamy, jointly presented the so-called Lamy-Verheugen Plan that proposed a factual &quot;unification&quot; of France and Germany in some important areas – including unified armed forces, combined embassies and a shared seat at the United Nations Security Council.

As a Commissioner, Verheugen stated a desire to cut red tape, especially in order to make it more favourable to SMEs. He also highlights research and innovation as &quot;twin keys to future competitiveness&quot;. He outlines his priorities as; better regulation, a modern industrial policy, SMEs and innovation. In order to promote competitiveness, he laid down three policies derived from the treaties; &quot;Competitiveness and improvement of the business environment (Art. 157). Completing and managing the Internal Market for products (Art. 28 and 95) and Innovation and research framework programmes (Title XVIII).&quot;

Verheugen was heavily involved in work on the REACH regulation and ensuring its compatibility with the Lisbon Strategy. He sees a common patent in the Union implemented by 2012 which he sees as important as patent application for the 24 million SMEs in Europe are on average 11 times higher than in the United States.

In response to the refusal of countries to sign the Kyoto protocol, such as the United States and Australia, Verheugen asked President Barroso to look into whether the EU could implement taxes on products imported from those countries not taking low-carbon policies on board (Border Tax Adjustments).

In October 2006, Verheugen accused European Union officials of being impossible to control, stating &quot;inter alia&quot; the purported impossibility of firing Directors-General (the highest grade in the EU civil servants structure). However, Article 50 of the EU&#x27;s Staff Regulations empowers the commission to do precisely that. Former civil servant Derk Jan Eppink described Verheugen&#x27;s position in the following terms:
== Later years ==
Since leaving public office, Verheugen has held a variety of paid or unpaid positions, including the following:

*FleishmanHillard, Member of the International Advisory Board
* German-Azerbaijani Forum, Member of the Board of Trustees
*German Council on Foreign Relations (DGAP), Member
* Turkey: Culture of Change Initiative (TCCI), Member of the Advisory Board
*National Association of German Cooperative Banks (BVR), Advisor (since 2010)
*Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS), Senior Advisor (since 2010)

In 2014 Verheugen was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburg&#x27;s NRW School of Governance. He gave both seminars and lectures at the university.

From March 2015, Verheugen headed the European integration work stream in the Dmytro Firtash-backed Agency for the Modernisation of Ukraine (AMU), a non-governmental organization developing a comprehensive program of modernization of Ukraine and looking for investment resources for its implementation. Verheugen led the Agency&#x27;s sectoral division for the institutional reforms recommendations aimed at the integration of Ukraine into the EU and civil society building.

==Controversy==
In 2001, former Czech Prime Minister Václav Klaus accused Verheugen of a &quot;tragic misuse of his position&quot;, after Verheugen warned that the country&#x27;s hope of joining the European Union swiftly would take a setback if the right-leaning Civic Democrats won the 2002 elections. On 5 November 2004, during a press conference, Verheugen mentioned that the future prime-minister of Romania would be Mircea Geoană (of the PSD) and that Romania would end negotiations with the EU with just four days before the Romanian legislative and presidential elections. Following this, Romanian journalists accused him of meddling in Romanian politics.

During his time in office, photographs appeared showing Verheugen holidaying with Petra Erler, the head of his private office. A Commission spokesman backed him by saying &quot;the private holidays of Vice President Verheugen in Lithuania this summer did not violate the rules applicable to members of the Commission&quot;. Despite this, there was a minor political row over Erler&#x27;s appointment with allegations of her being appointed due to their friendship. These allegations were later aggravated over photos of them together on holiday holding hands, and then on a naturist beach together in Lithuania.

==Positions==
Verheugen regards the Ukrainian government as a &quot;puppet regime&quot;; he claims that the Maidan movement was a planned coup d&#x27;etat; and that Russia could not be blamed for waging a war against Ukraine; he also called Svoboda members of the Ukrainian government (&quot;true fascists&quot;).
===On cutting EU bureaucracy===
* &quot;Many people still have this concept of Europe that the more rules you produce the more Europe you have.&quot;
*: (October 2006)
* &quot;The idea is that the role of the commission is to keep the machinery running and the machinery is producing laws. And that&#x27;s exactly what I want to change.&quot;
*: (October 2006)
* &quot;We must ask the question of whether so many decisions need to be taken in Brussels.&quot;
*: (June 2016)

==Honours ==
National honours

* : Knight Commander of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany

Foreign honours
* : Honorary citizen of Šibenik
* : 1st Class of the Order of the Cross of Terra Mariana
* : 1st Class of the Order of the Three Stars

<doc id="627733" wikidata="Q17144492" url="?curid=627733" title="Reis telephone">
<text>The Reis telephone was an invention named after Philipp Reis of a telephone-like device he constructed. Reis&#x27;s first successful work is dated to October 1861. It was the first device to transmit a voice via electronic signals and for that the first modern telephone. Reis also coined the term.

==History==
In 1861, Philipp Reis succeeded in creating a device that captured sound, converted it to electrical impulses which were transmitted via electrical wires to another device that transformed these pulses into recognizable sounds similar to the original acoustical source. Reis coined the term &quot;telephon&quot; to describe his device.

In 1862, Reis demonstrated his telephone to Wilhelm von Legat, Inspector of the Royal Prussian Telegraph Corps who produced an account of it (Legat, 1862), a translation of which was obtained by Thomas Edison in 1875 and which was used in Edison&#x27;s successful development of the carbon microphone. The Legat account included drawings that are different from that below, suggesting that it is of a later version. Edison acknowledged his debt to Reis thus:
The first inventor of a telephone was Phillip Reis of Germany only musical not articulating. The first person to publicly exhibit a telephone for transmission of articulate speech was A. G. Bell. The first practical commercial telephone for transmission of articulate speech was invented by myself. Telephones used throughout the world are mine and Bell&#x27;s. Mine is used for transmitting. Bell&#x27;s is used for receiving.

== Microphone ==
As Reis was considering his invention as a means of broadcasting music, he termed his microphone the &#x27;singing station&#x27;. The Reis microphone was based on a horizontal parchment diaphragm as a sound transducer. The diaphragm was mounted on the top of a closed wooden sound box, with a speaking horn on the front. Sound received by the horn caused the diaphragm to vibrate. Above this were two brass strips, later with two platinum contacts, originally with a single platinum contact, and the lower contact formed of a drop of mercury in a recess at the end of the screw. One strip was glued to the center of the diaphragm; another strip, usually two strips in a V, was mounted above this. The strip&#x27;s weight gave a light pressure between the contacts.

Sound vibrations caused the diaphragm and lower contact to vibrate in sympathy. This changed the resistance between the two contacts, giving an electrical signal to the telephone line.

=== Patent dispute ===
There was some question as to the operation of the microphone. It is regarded today as having varied the &quot;resistance&quot; of the contacts. However, Reis&#x27;s description claimed that the contacts opened and closed. At the time, it was held that a circuit with such a &#x27;make and break&#x27; circuit was incapable of transmitting intelligible speech. Reis&#x27;s device had been used to transmit speech from 1861, and widely publicly demonstrated from 1863, yet when Bell&#x27;s patent claim was set against Reis&#x27;s primacy of inventing the telephone this &#x27;inability&#x27; for it to work because of its use of a &quot;false theory&quot; was enough to (legally) portray Reis&#x27;s invention as invalid, thus allowing Bell to claim novelty.

==Loudspeaker==

Reis&#x27;s speaker worked by magnetostriction. In his first receiver he wound a coil of wire around an iron knitting needle and rested the needle against the F hole of a violin. As current passed through the needle, the iron &quot;shrank&quot; and a click was produced. The image, below, shows an advanced version where the iron bar is clamped to a cigar-box-shaped resonator. This receiver is not very sensitive. It produces weak sound but has good fidelity. It requires very high current and is a current-sensitive device rather than a voltage-sensitive device.

This instrument could transmit continuous musical tones but produced indistinct speech. In 1865, however, British-American scientist David E. Hughes used the Reis telephone with &quot;good results&quot;.

<doc id="627734" wikidata="Q5314760" url="?curid=627734" title="Dundas County, Ontario">
<text>Dundas County is a former county in the province of Ontario, Canada. It was named after Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville, who was the British Home Secretary (1791–1794), with responsibility for the colonies.

Dundas was first settled by individuals of European background in 1784, when German Loyalists who had fought with Sir John Johnson in the American Revolutionary War re-settled in Canada. The settlers were descendants of the Palatine immigrants to America in 1710.

== Boundaries ==

In 1792, Dundas County was formally established by a proclamation of the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, John Graves Simcoe, which established several counties in Upper Canada including Dundas. The boundaries of Dundas county were defined as follows:

That the third of the said counties be hereafter called by the name of the county of Dundas; which county is to be bounded on the east by the westernmost boundary line of the county of Stormont, on the south by the river St. Lawrence, and on the west by the easternmost boundary line of the late township of Edwardsburgh, running north twenty-four degrees west until it intersects the Ottawa or Grand river, thence descending the said river until it meets the northwesternmost boundary of the county of Stormont. The said county of Dundas is to comprehend all the islands in the said river St. Lawrence nearest to the said county, in the whole or greater part fronting the same.

Dundas originally stretched farther to the north, but in 1800, when Carleton County was established, parts of Dundas County were made part of Carleton County. The new boundaries for Dundas were as follows:

In 1850, Dundas united with Stormont and Glengarry to form the regional government United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry. 

==Original townships==
* Matilda (area ), was first settled in 1784 by German Loyalists. The Township was formally organized in 1787. The Township was named in honour of the Princess Royal, Charlotte Augusta Matilda, who married the King of Württemberg in 1797. During the War of 1812 a wooden fort and earthwork was established at Point Iroquois and named &quot;Fort Needless&quot;, and three battles occurred in the vicinity: the Battle of Matilda, Battle of Point Iroquois, and the Skirmish at Doran&#x27;s Farm. This Township is now part of South Dundas
** Community centres: Iroquois, Irena, Dundela, Glen Stewart, Brinston, Hulbert and Pleasant Valley
* Mountain (area ), was organized in 1798 and named in honour of the first Church of England Bishop of Quebec, Rev. Jacob Mountain. This Township is now part of North Dundas
** Community centres: Mountain, South Mountain, Hallville, and Inkerman
* Williamsburgh (area ), was settled in 1784 it became a Township in 1787. Named in honour of Prince William Henry, third son of George III, afterwards King William IV. The famous Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm was fought on Lot 12, Concession I on the Fetterly and Crysler farms. A monument was placed there in 1895. This Township is now part of South Dundas.
** Community centres: Morrisburg, Williamsburg, Aultsville, Frostburg, Bouck’s Hill, Dunbar and Archer
* Winchester (area ), was opened in 1798 and named after the English city of Winchester. This Township is now part of North Dundas.
** Community centres: Winchester, Chesterville, Morewood, Winchester Springs, North Winchester (Cannamore), Ormond, Melville and Cass Bridge

<text>A monal is a bird of genus Lophophorus of the pheasant family, Phasianidae. 
==Description==
The males all have colorful, iridescent plumage. Their physique is rather plump, and their diet consists of plants such as roots and bulbs and insects. During mating, the males are polygamous and mate with several females. The females in turn only mate with the selected male and enter into a monogamous relationship. Due to habitat destruction and hunting, they have become rare and their population is endangered.
==Species==
There are three species and several subspecies:

<text>Frontenac County is a county and census division of the Canadian province of Ontario. It is located in the eastern portion of Southern Ontario. The city of Kingston is in the Frontenac census division, but is separated from the County of Frontenac.

==History==

The county of Frontenac, situated within the Mecklenburg District, was originally created as an electoral district for the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in 1792 and its original limits were described as being:

Mecklenburg was renamed as the &quot;Midland District&quot; in 1792.

At the beginning of 1800, the County was reorganized as follows:

:* the eastern part of the islands of the county of Ontario were transferred to Frontenac, on the former&#x27;s dissolution
:* Frontenac was declared to consist solely of the townships of Pittsburg, Kingston, Loughborough, Portland, Hinchbrooke, Bedford and Wolfe Island
:* the remaining unorganized territory remained part of Midland District

Through the addition of newly surveyed townships, by 1845 the County covered the following territory:

In 1860, the newly surveyed townships of Miller and Canonto were transferred from Renfrew County

In 1998, the County was reorganized, and it now consists of the townships of North Frontenac, Central Frontenac, South Frontenac and Frontenac Islands. The City of Kingston absorbed Kingston and Pittsburgh Townships and exists now as a separated municipality.

The county council itself was abolished and replaced by a management unit with limited powers, known as the Frontenac Management Board. The management unit became a county again in 2004.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Frontenac County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<doc id="627750" wikidata="Q1638493" url="?curid=627750" title="Huron County, Ontario">
<text>Huron County is a county of the province of Ontario, Canada. It is located on the southeast shore of its namesake, Lake Huron, in the southwest part of the province. The county seat is Goderich, also the county&#x27;s largest community.

The population reported in the 2021 Census for this predominantly agricultural area with many villages and small towns was 61,366 in a land area of 3,398 square kilometres. Of the total population, 7,881 reside in Goderich.

==History==
The portion of the Huron Tract ceded to the Canada Company was established as the &quot;County of Huron&quot; in 1835, with the exception of certain townships that were transferred to other counties:

:* Adelaide Township went to Middlesex County
:* The townships of Moore and Sarnia, Plympton, Enniskillen, Warwick, Brooke and Bosanquet went to Kent County

===Historic townships===
In 1835, the county was declared to consist of the following townships:
* Biddulph
* Blanshard
* Colborne
* Downie
* Ellice
* South Easthope
* North Easthope
* Fullarton
* Goderich
* Hay
* Hibbert
* Hullett
* Logan
* McKillop
* McGillivray
* Stephen
* Stanley
* Tuckersmith
* Usborne
* Williams
They have since devolved to the following counties (as outlined in red):

===Territorial evolution===
Legislation was passed by the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in 1838 to authorize the separation of the county from the London District and constitute it as the Huron District. The county was extended northward in 1840, upon the survey of a new range of townships on its northern boundary, beginning with Ashfield Township, and later including Wawanosh, Morris, Grey and Elma. The District itself came into being in October 1841.

Huron County was continued for electoral purposes in 1845, and the District was extended northwards as far as the Bruce Peninsula in 1846.

The District (which existed for judicial and municipal purposes) was abolished at the beginning of 1850. Legislation passed later in the same session of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada provided for the county to be reconstituted as the United Counties of Huron, Perth and Bruce, with the territory of the Bruce Peninsula withdrawn and annexed to Waterloo County. The townships were distributed as follows:

The Bruce Peninsula was later returned to Bruce in 1851. The County of Perth was given its own Provisional Municipal Council at that time, and was separated from the United Counties in 1853.

Several townships were transferred to Middlesex County:

:* Williams, in 1845
:* Biddulph and McGillivray, in 1862.

Legislation was passed in 1866 to provide for the dissolution of the United Counties on January 1, 1867, with Huron and Bruce County becoming separate counties for all purposes.

==Government==
The Huron County Council consists of fifteen members from the nine area municipalities to ensure that each is represented on this council. Each year, a Warden is elected from the group; this individual chairs meetings and represents the County at various functions. Elected to Ashfeild-Colborne-Wawanosh Council in 2014, and acclaimed as Mayor in 2018, the current Warden is Glen McNeil.

Most of the population of the county resides in the Huron—Bruce, formerly Huron and Huron—Middlesex, federal electoral district. The majority also reside in the Huron—Bruce (provincial electoral district) formerly known as Huron and Huron—Middlesex.

The county&#x27;s Official Plan (2015) addresses the following issues: &quot;agriculture, community services, the economy, natural environment, extractive resources, and settlement patterns.&quot; According to this document, agriculture is a particularly significant part of the economy since &quot;Huron leads all counties and regions in Ontario in total value of production; and it also exceeds the production totals of several provinces&quot;.

===Municipalities===
Huron County comprises nine lower-tier municipalities (in order of population):

* Municipality of South Huron (population centre: Exeter)
* Municipality of Huron East (population centres: Seaforth, Brussels)
* Town of Goderich
* Municipality of Central Huron (population centre: Clinton)
* Municipality of Bluewater (population centre: Bayfield)
* Township of Ashfield–Colborne–Wawanosh
* Township of North Huron (population centre: Wingham, Blyth)
* Municipality of Howick
* Municipality of Morris-Turnberry

The boundaries of the county&#x27;s municipalities have been in effect since 2001, after the provincial government imposed mergers throughout the province.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Huron County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

<text>The Mildenhall Treasure is a large hoard of 34 masterpieces of Roman silver tableware from the fourth century AD, and by far the most valuable Roman objects artistically and by weight of bullion in Britain. It may have been found at West Row, near Mildenhall, Suffolk, in 1942. It consists of over thirty items and includes the Great Dish which weighs over .

The collection is on view in the British Museum because of its immense importance and value, and replicas are on show in the local museum at Mildenhall.

==History of discovery==

The hoard was said to have been discovered while ploughing in January 1942 by Gordon Butcher, who claimed he had removed it from the ground with help from Sydney Ford, for whom he was working at the time. Many details of the discovery remain uncertain, not least because it took place during wartime. They claimed that they did not at first recognise the objects for what they were, although Ford collected ancient objects. Ford cleaned the pieces and displayed them in his house, using some of them as daily utensils and some, such as the Great Dish, on special occasions with the family. Ford had to declare the hoard to the authorities in 1946 after a knowledgeable friend, Dr. Hugh A. Fawcett, had seen them in his home and reported them. An inquest was held that year, when the find was legally declared a &quot;treasure trove&quot; and acquired by the British Museum in London. Academic opinion at the time was generally reluctant to believe that such fine-quality Roman silver could have been used in Roman Britain, and there were many imaginative rumours and even doubts that this was a genuine British find at all. The numerous well-documented discoveries of high-quality Roman material in subsequent decades, including the Hoxne Hoard also found in Suffolk in 1992, have set all such doubts to rest.

In the 1990s, Richard Hobbs drew attention to the importance of the partly fictional account by Roald Dahl, and addressed the issues surrounding the actual finding. In Dahl&#x27;s version of events, Hobbs believes that Ford was fully aware of the significance of the find, but could not bear to part with the treasure. He kept it and restored it in secret, but two of the spoons left out on display were seen by an unexpected visitor, Dr. Fawcett.

Ford and Butcher were awarded £1000 each as finders, although not necessarily the full &quot;ex gratia&quot; reward, since the find had not been correctly reported and since most of those involved doubted that Ford and Butcher had given a true account of the finding. The two archaeologists who had represented the British Museum at the inquest – Tom Lethbridge and Major Gordon Fowler – continued to research the finding for some years after 1946, but in the end could only be sure of one thing – that Ford had not told the truth about how and where he had obtained the treasure. In Paul Ashbee’s words, Ford&#x27;s account was &#x27;patently spurious&#x27; and the source of treasure was a case of &quot;ignotum per ignotius&quot;.

==History of display and publication ==
The Mildenhall find was placed on show in its entirety in the British Museum as soon as the necessary registration and conservation work had been completed following its acquisition in 1946, and it has remained a permanent feature of the museum&#x27;s Romano-British gallery ever since, with occasional loans of some pieces to special exhibitions both within the museum and elsewhere.

John W. Brailsford promptly published the first brief, summary catalogue of the find, and successive revised editions of this booklet were published in 1955 and 1964. A somewhat fuller, though still brief, study by Kenneth S. Painter came out in 1977. (Note that the catalogue numbers in Painter 1977, cited in the descriptions below, correspond with the sequence of Museum registration numbers, 1946.10-1.1–34, established in the original curatorial listing of the objects). The most striking object in the treasure, the Great Dish (see below) has been illustrated and mentioned in countless publications, including a major paper on late Roman &quot;picture plates&quot;.

A detailed study of the treasure has recently been published by the British Museum.

== The contents of the hoard ==
The treasure consists of silver tableware of types current in the 4th century, and it was probably concealed at some time in that century. Most of the objects are comparatively large, and all are of very high-quality workmanship.

The hoard consists of two large serving platters, two small decorated serving plates, a deep fluted bowl, a set of four large decorated bowls, two small decorated bowls, two small pedestalled dishes, a deep flanged bowl with a deep, domed cover, five small round ladles with dolphin-shaped handles, and eight long-handled spoons (&quot;cochlearium&quot;).

=== Platters and dishes ===

The Great Dish (also known as the Oceanus Dish or as the Neptune Dish, from the face of a sea-god at its centre), which measures in diameter and weighs , is the outstanding piece. The decoration, which was worked by chasing from the front, is in three concentric zones. In the centre, the head of a marine deity, probably Oceanus, the personification of the ocean, is shown full-face, with a beard made of seaweed, and with dolphins emerging from his hair. This portrait is surrounded by a narrow inner frieze of decoration, populated by nereids (sea-nymphs), tritons and other mythical and natural sea-creatures, while the deep outermost zone carries imagery of the Bacchic &quot;thiasos&quot;: the dancing, music-making and drinking revels of the god Bacchus. More specifically, the triumph of Bacchus over Hercules is depicted. Hercules is shown staggering drunkenly and supported by two helpful satyrs. Bacchus himself appears with his panther and Silenus at the &#x27;12 o&#x27;clock&#x27; position on the circle in relation to the orientation of the Oceanus head, so that in most illustrations of the dish, he is seen upside-down at the top of the picture. The god Pan also appears in the composition, dancing and brandishing his pan-pipes, as do several dancing Maenads, the female devotees of Bacchus, and satyrs. The entire design is traditionally pagan, and is superbly executed.
Two small plates (respectively 188 and 185 mm in diameter; weights 539 and 613 g.) are decorated in precisely the same style as the Great Dish: one shows the god Pan playing his pipes, and a maenad playing the double flute; the other shows a dancing satyr with a dancing maenad. Both of these small dishes have scratched graffiti in Greek on their undersides: &quot;eutheriou&quot;, meaning &#x27;(property) of Eutherios&#x27;. Both also have a bold, beaded edging, as do the Great Dish itself and several other items in the assemblage.

Another large, flat serving platter is almost as big as the Great Dish, with a diameter of 556 mm, but it is decorated in a very different and more restrained style, consisting of linear geometric decoration, inlaid with contrasting black niello (silver sulphide) to form a wide-rimmed border and a circular central panel.

=== Bowls ===

A deep, fluted bowl with two small swing handles (which were detached at the time of discovery, because solder tends to loosen during burial) is of a type found in several late Roman silver hoards, such as those in the Esquiline Treasure from Rome, and from Traprain Law in Scotland. The type is thought to have developed from earlier shell-shaped bowls, and to have been used to contain water at the dining table, intended for rinsing diners&#x27; hands. The chased geometric design in the centre of the Mildenhall fluted bowl depicts a six-pointed star, a device that had no specific symbolic meaning in the Roman period, but was simply one of many popular geometric figures.

The covered bowl is a vessel of particular interest. It is the earliest object in the hoard, and the only one whose general area of manufacture within the Roman Empire is known for certain. It belongs to a type that is known to have been manufactured in Gaul in the 3rd century AD. It has a narrow, horizontal flange set below the upright rim and decorated with scroll patterns inlaid in niello, and a small nielloed rosette within the centre base. It has a high, domed lid that fits neatly over the vertical rim and has been decorated in a very different style, with two friezes of low-relief decoration. The upper zone consists of conventional foliate ornament, while the lower is a scene of centaurs attacking various wild animals, separated by Bacchic masks. The small raised rim at the top of the lid would have sufficed for handling it, but set within it is a &#x27;knob&#x27; in the form of a silver-gilt statuette of a young, seated triton blowing a conch shell. This figure may well be a secondary addition to the lid; the lid itself, in 4th century style, is certainly a secondary addition to the bowl.

A set of four bowls with wide, horizontal rims represent a later development of the flanged bowl form. The rims, or flanges, are edged with large beads, and have low-relief decoration that once more follows the traditional pagan, Bacchic theme, with pastoral scenes, numerous animals, natural and mythical, and Bacchic masks. They also have circular medallions of figural decoration within the bowl. One (no.5) has a scene showing a hunter attacking a bear. This bowl, with a diameter of 300 mm, is a little larger than the other three, which all have a diameter of 268 mm and central medallions depicting single heads in profile: a young woman, a veiled matron, and a helmeted head. The identification of these figures remains uncertain.

There is a matching pair of smaller flanged bowls, (diameter 168 mm): they are intricately decorated with beading, foliate scrolls and small birds and hares on the rims, and have rosettes in relief in the centre base. The main bodies of these little bowls have a delicate, fluted internal pattern.

=== Pedestalled dishes ===

Two pedestalled dishes also form a pair. They were originally thought to be stemmed cups with wide, flat bases, somewhat like a modern wineglass in shape, but the foliate pattern on the &#x27;bases&#x27; and the relatively unfinished interiors of the &#x27;cups&#x27; show that they were used the other way up, as small (115mm diameter) flat dishes on a stem with a bowl-shaped base. Vessels of the same shape occur in the Traprain Law treasure, found in 1919.

=== Spoons ===

The remaining objects in the Mildenhall assemblage are all small eating utensils; five round-bowled ladles or spoons, and eight long-handled spoons of the common, late-Roman &quot;cochlear&quot; type. The round &#x27;ladles&#x27; have zoomorphic handles cast in the form of dolphins. There is a comparable piece in the Traprain treasure, and there are two sets each of ten ladles of this type (although not with zoomorphic handles) in the Hoxne hoard. Only four handles survive from the Mildenhall ladles, and one of those is broken and incomplete. Because handles and bowls were soldered together in antiquity and had separated during burial, it is not certain which handle belongs to which bowl. In theory, if each component bowl and each handle were from a different utensil, there could have been as many as 9 ladles originally. In practice, it seems more likely that the handles and bowls all belong together; the group has therefore been reconstructed as five ladles, combining the existing handles and bowls.

== Inscriptions ==
The ownership graffiti of Eutherios on the two small Bacchic platters, several of the Mildenhall pieces, in common with many large items of Roman silver tableware from other finds, bear weight-inscriptions. These are scratched in inconspicuous places, such as bases, and can be very difficult to read and interpret, since they do not necessarily record the weight of the object itself, but sometimes of a set of which that object forms part. Although domestic silver was used for social display, so that its artistic quality was important to the owner, the actual bullion value of precious metal was part of his wealth, and needed to be noted and recorded.

== Importance ==

The Mildenhall treasure contains pieces that undoubtedly belong to the first rank of Roman art and craftsmanship on an international scale of excellence. Although it was found at a time, and in a manner, that leave many unanswered questions about the reasons for and date of its concealment, the overall 4th-century dating is certain, and the decoration, with its traditional pagan themes, in some of the minor pieces, is characteristic of that period of change in the Roman Empire. We cannot yet say where objects such as the Great Dish were manufactured, but it seems safe to surmise that it would have been somewhere in the general Mediterranean region.

The rate of discovery of metal hoards of all periods has accelerated in Britain since the middle of the 20th century, due to a combination of circumstances that include changing agricultural practices, the rise of metal-detecting as a hobby, and better public understanding of archaeology. The Mildenhall group is exceptional by any standards, but in 1946, it seemed of too great a quality to be a British find.

Older finds, such as the treasures from Traprain Law and the Esquiline Hill in Rome, and more recent ones, such as the Kaiseraugst treasure from Augusta Raurica in Switzerland and the Hoxne hoard, can now place the Mildenhall treasure in international and Romano-British contexts that make it clear that personal possessions of very high quality were indeed in use in the frontier province of Britain in the 4th century AD. In this context, the Mildenhall material remains pre-eminent as a partial set of silver tableware of that period.

The hoard was number 7 in the list of British archaeological finds selected by experts at the British Museum for the 2003 BBC Television documentary &quot;Our Top Ten Treasures&quot; presented by Adam Hart-Davis.

==Controversy==
While the majority of scholars support the identification and dating of the objects, and their association with the Mildenhall site, some scholars around the time of the discovery, were suspicious that the Mildenhall Treasure was misdated, or may not truly belong to the Mildenhall site. They argued that the pieces do not properly resemble the style and quality of work expected to be found in provincial Roman Britain, and that since none of the pieces show damage from having been &quot;discovered&quot; with a plough or shovel, there is the possibility that it was not in fact buried at Mildenhall all these centuries, and rather came from somewhere else. Some have suggested the pieces were looted from sites in Italy during World War II, brought back to England and re-buried so as to stage a &quot;discovery&quot;, though most scholars give little credit to that theory, and abide by the standard story that the objects were hidden by fleeing Romans who intended to return for them at a later date and never did. The argument that the British province did not have silverware of such high quality has been disproved by a number of subsequent discoveries, for example the Hoxne Hoard.

<text>Edwin Brant Frost II (July 14, 1866 – May 14, 1935) was an American astronomer and longest serving Director of the Yerkes Observatory serving from 1905 to 1932. 

==Biography==
He was born in Brattleboro, Vermont. His father, Carlton Pennington Frost, was dean of Dartmouth Medical School.

Frost graduated from Dartmouth in 1886. He continued his education as a post-graduate student in chemistry and in 1887 became an instructor in physics while only 21 years old. In 1890 Frost went abroad to Europe and ended up researching stellar spectroscopy under Hermann Vogel in Potsdam. He returned to Dartmouth in 1892 as an assistant professor of astronomy.

He was fond of the outdoors and enjoyed golf, swimming, and ice skating. He also enjoyed music and literature. In 1896 he married Mary E. Hazard. They had three children, Katharine, Frederick, and Benjamin.

Frost joined the staff of Yerkes Observatory in 1898 and became its director in 1905 when George Hale resigned. Frost kept the position until his retirement in 1932. He also succeeded Hale as the editor of the &quot;Astrophysical Journal&quot;, from 1902 to 1932, and was known for his careful attention to details. In 1915 he lost the use of his right eye and in 1921, his left. Despite his blindness he continued working for eleven more years until his retirement in 1932.

Frost was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1908, the American Philosophical Society in 1909, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1913.

He died in 1935 in Chicago from peritonitis.

==Legacy==
Frost&#x27;s research focused on the determination of radial velocity using stellar spectroscopy and spectroscopic binaries. In 1902, he discovered the strange behavior of Beta Cephei, which later became the prototype for Beta Cephei variable stars.

He played a significant role in bringing Otto Struve to the United States, when the latter was living as an impoverished refugee in Turkey after the Russian Revolution. He later supported the appointment of Struve as his successor as director of Yerkes Observatory.

Asteroid 854 Frostia is named in his honor, as is the lunar crater Frost, on the far side of the Moon.

<text>The De La Salle Brothers, officially named the Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools (; ; ) abbreviated FSC, is a Catholic lay religious congregation of pontifical right for men founded in France by Jean-Baptiste de La Salle (1651–1719), and now based in Rome, Italy. The De La Salle Brothers are also known as the Christian Brothers (sometimes by Lasallian organisations themselves), French Christian Brothers, or Lasallian Brothers. The Lasallian Christian Brothers are distinct from the Congregation of Christian Brothers, often also referred to as simply the Christian Brothers, or Irish Christian Brothers. The Lasallian Brothers use the post-nominal abbreviation FSC to denote their membership of the order, and the honorific title Brother, abbreviated &quot;Br.&quot;

The Lasallian order stated that the Institute had 2,883 Brothers, who helped in running 1,154 education centers in 78 countries with 1,160,328 students, together with 107,827 teachers and lay associates. There are La Salle educational institutions in countries ranging from impoverished nations such as Nigeria to post-secondary institutions such as Bethlehem University (Bethlehem, Palestine), Manhattan University (New York City), US, College Mont La Salle (Ain Saadeh, Lebanon), and La Salle University (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, US). The central administration of the Brothers operates out of the Generalate in Rome, Italy and is made up of the Superior General and his councillors.

A number of Lasallian institutions in several countries have been accused of, and have admitted and apologised for, long-standing and serious physical and sexual abuse against their charges.

==History==
In March, 1679, Jean-Baptiste de La Salle met Adrian Nyel in a chance encounter at the Convent of the Sisters of the Infant Jesus. Nyel asked for La Salle&#x27;s help in opening free schools for the poor boys in Reims. A novitiate and normal school were established in Paris in 1694. La Salle spent his life teaching poor children in parish charity schools. The school flourished and widened in scope; in 1725, six years after La Salle&#x27;s death, the society was recognised by the pope, under the official title of &quot;Brothers of the Christian Schools&quot;. La Salle was canonised as a saint on 15 May 1900. In 1950 Pope Pius XII declared him to be the &quot;Special Patron of All Teachers of Youth in the Catholic Church&quot;.

The order, approved by Pope Benedict XIII in 1725, rapidly spread over France. It was dissolved by a decree of the National Assembly set up after the French Revolution in February 1790, but recalled by Napoleon I in 1804 and formally recognised by the French government in 1808. Since then its members penetrated into nearly every country of Europe, Africa, America, Asia and Australia.

==The Order==
As religious, members take the three usual vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The Institute&#x27;s headquarters is in Rome, Italy. The order has five global regions: North America (Région Lasallienne de l’Amérique du Nord, RELAN), Asia/Oceania (Pacific-Asia Regional Conference, PARC), Europe/Mediterranean (Région Lasallienne Européenne-Méditerranéenne, RELEM), Africa (Région Lasallienne Africano-Malgache, RELAF), and Latin America (Region Latinoamericana Lasallista, RELAL).

During the International Year of Literacy/Schooling (1990), the Unesco awarded the Noma Literacy Prize to Lasallian Institutions.

The order says that its key principles are faith in the presence of God, concern for the poor and social justice, inclusive community, respect for all people, and quality education.

In 2017 the Institute had 3,800 brothers, 75% fewer than in 1965. The decline is due partly to many brothers reaching retirement age, and the small number of new recruits. In the same period the number of students in Lasallian schools increased from about 700,000 to over a million.

==Activities==
===Education===

La Salle initiated a number of innovations in teaching. He recommended dividing up of the children into distinct classes according to their attainments. He also taught pupils to read the vernacular language.
In accordance with their mission statement &quot;to provide a human and Christian education ... especially [to] the poor&quot; the Brothers&#x27; principal activity is education, especially of the poor. The Lasallian order stated that the Institute had 2,883 Brothers, who helped in running 1,154 education centers in 78 countries with 1,160,328 students, together with 107,827 teachers and lay associates.

===Institutions===
* The Guadalupana De La Salle Sisters were founded by Br. Juan Fromental Cayroche in the Archdiocese of Mexico. They currently teach in ten countries. The motherhouse is in Mexico City.
* The Congregation of the Lasallian Sisters was founded in 1966 by the Brothers of the Christian School in Vietnam to take care of the needs of poor children abandoned because of the civil war there. The office is in Bangkok.
* Lasallian Volunteers are lay people who volunteer for one or two years to engage in teaching and other Lasallian activities. They receive room and board and a living stipend.

===Protection of the environment===
English Lasallian lay brother and missionary Paul McAuley went to Peru in 1995 as part of his ministry in the Brothers of the Christian Schools, and set up a school in a poor shantytown in Lima; after a few years he was honoured with the British award of MBE for his work. He gave the award away and said that he would otherwise have returned it in protest at British companies&#x27; activities in the rainforest. In 2000, he founded the La Salle Intercultural Student Community, a hostel for indigenous schoolchildren in Belén, a neighbourhood of the jungle city of Iquitos. He helped tribes in the Amazon rainforest to fight against oil and gas companies expanding into the rainforest; local news media described him as a &quot;Tarzan activist&quot;, &quot;white terrorist&quot; and &quot;incendiary gringo priest&quot;. In July 2010, the Peruvian government revoked his residency permit for participating in activities &quot;such as protest marches and other acts against the Peruvian state which constitute a breach of public order.&quot; He fought the expulsion in Peruvian courts and won his right to stay.

On 2 April 2019, his dead body was discovered in the same hostel he founded in Iquitos; his body had been burned after his death. Peru&#x27;s episcopal conference praised McAuley and called on the authorities to investigate the crime.

===Other activities===
====Investment services====
In 1981, the Institute started Christian Brothers Investment Services (CBIS), a &quot;socially responsible investing service&quot; exclusively for Catholic organisations, saying that it &quot;encourage[s] companies to improve policies and practices through active ownership&quot;.

====Winery====
The Brothers arrived in Martinez, California, US, on the southern edge of the Carquinez Strait, part of the greater San Francisco Bay in 1868. In 1882 they began making wine for their own use at table and as sacramental wine. They also began to distill brandy, beginning with the pot-still production method that is used in the cognac region. Their production expanded until 1920, when prohibition limited their production to wines for sacramental use.

In 1932, at the end of Prohibition, they relocated the winery to the Mont La Salle property in the Napa Valley and continued making wine, in larger quantities. In 1935 Brother Timothy Diener became wine master, and he served in this position for 50 years. In the 1950s they acquired Greystone Cellars near St. Helena, California. Varietal wine was made at the Napa Valley facility, generic wine and brandy were produced at Reedley in the San Joaquin Valley, and barrel ageing was handled at Greystone.

The Christian Brothers winery operated under the corporate name &quot;Mont La Salle Vineyards&quot;. In 1988 the winery employed 250 people and produced 900,000 cases of wine, 1.2 million cases of brandy, and 80,000 cases of altar wine. Proceeds from sales helped to fund the Christian Brothers programs and schools, such as Cathedral High School in Los Angeles, and the care of ageing Brothers.

In 1989 the vineyards were sold to Heublein, Inc. The sacramental wine brand was purchased by four former Christian Brothers winery executives who carry on production under the name &quot;Mont La Salle Altar Wines&quot;. The Brothers retained the Mont La Salle property and have a retreat located there.

==Child sexual abuse==
&lt;section begin=Controversies involving Catholic organizations transclusion/&gt;In the Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry (HIA), an inquiry into institutional sexual and physical abuse in Northern Ireland institutions that were in charge of children from 1922 to 1995, the De La Salle Brothers admitted in 2014 to the abuse of boys at two institutions: the former De La Salle Boys&#x27; Home Rubane House in Kircubbin, County Down, and St Patrick&#x27;s Training School in west Belfast, and apologised to its victims. The order accepted that one of its earliest overseers engaged in sexual offences. Representing the de la Salle order, Kevin Rooney QC said the brothers recognised that some of their members had caused &quot;immense pain&quot; to children which was &quot;in contradiction to their vocation&quot;. Senior Counsel Christine Smith QC said, &quot;...[T]hose homes operated as outdated survivors of a bygone age.&quot;

The Inquiry&#x27;s first public hearings were held from January to May 2014 with the inquiry team reporting to the Executive by the start of 2016. Module 3: &quot;De La Salle Boys Home at Rubane House, Kircubbin&quot;, started on 29 September 2014 and was completed on 17 December, when the chairman paid tribute to the victims who testified. By October 2014 about 200 former residents of Rubane House made allegations of abuse, and 55 alleged that they themselves were physically or sexually abused. Billy McConville, orphaned when his mother Jean McConville was abducted and shot by the IRA in 1972, waived anonymity and described repeated sexual and physical abuse, and starvation, at Rubane House. During the inquiry counsel for the De La Salle order said compensation had been paid, and accepted that some members had abused young boys at the home, but that the order believed that some claims &quot;did not take place&quot;.

Brother Francis Manning FSC said that the order welcomed the inquiry. Before the abuse issue had become public a Brother wrote in a letter to an alleged abuser &quot;It is best forgotten and I have told some brothers that no reference is to be made to it among themselves or the boys. The whole affair is best dropped with the prayer that all will learn that lesson that our holy rule is very wise in its prescriptions&quot;. The order conducted dozens of internal interviews in this case, but did not report the matter to police.

On 11 March 2022 statements of apology were made in the Northern Ireland Assembly by ministers from the five main political parties in Northern Ireland and by representatives of six institutions where abuse had taken place, including Br Francis Manning representing the De La Salle Brothers. Several abuse survivors and their family members were critical of the apologies that were made by the institutional representatives.

In the 1960s the deputy headmaster of St Gilbert&#x27;s approved school (for young minor offenders) run by Brothers from the De La Salle order in Hartlebury, Worcestershire, England, was convicted of six counts of sexually abusing boys at the school. He was subsequently reinstated as a teacher at another school. In 2014, former pupils of the school described &quot;a 30-year campaign of sadistic and degrading abuse&quot; including rapes and beatings. A headmaster, a deputy headmaster, and Brothers were reported to have been among those responsible. Police launched an investigation into allegations of abuse at the school between the 1940s and 1970s after former pupils were interviewed by BBC Hereford and Worcester, and documents intended to be unavailable until 2044 were released under the Freedom of Information Act 2000. In 2017 and 2018 two former staff members were tried for serious sexual offences, assault causing actual bodily harm, and child cruelty. They were acquitted of all charges other than three charges of child cruelty against one of the defendants, on which the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Other, named, abusers were reported to have died.

There were other cases with many victims in countries including Scotland (St Ninian&#x27;s in Gartmore, Stirlingshire; St Joseph&#x27;s in Tranent; St Mary&#x27;s in Bishopbriggs), Australia, and Ireland where &quot;Some 46 alleged abusers are named in these 84 allegations of sex abuse.&quot; Serious and detailed allegations about decades-old abuse have been reported in the US, with several lawsuits being settled in favour of victims. After the scandal became widely known, branches of the Order apologised, publicly or to individual victims, for several of these cases. At St William&#x27;s residential school in Market Weighton, England, between 1970 and 1991 many boys were abused; 200 now-adult men have said they were abused. Abusers including the principal, James Carragher, were imprisoned in 2004 for past sexual abuse at the home. Five victims started High Court action for compensation in 2016. Four of the cases were dismissed in December 2016 The De La Salle order repeated their apologies for and condemnation of the abuse. The De La Salle Brothers also operated the controversial BoysTown school between 1961 and 2001, which is known for having the largest case of child abuse at a single institution in Australia&#x27;s history. Although only two staff, Brother Francis Brophy and Stephen Anthony Gray, were convicted of child sexual abuse by 2017, the trustees for the De La Salle Brothers had paid almost $27 million in compensation for 219 credible claims of abuse, representing the highest figure against a single church-run institution in Australia. 

Investigations and trials continued into 2022 involving a number of other schools and the De La Salle order has only apologised where they have been legally found guilty and not where the allegations haven&#x27;t been prosecuted. This had brought about a widespread condemnation from former, allegedly abused pupils who lack the evidence to bring about a prosecution.

<doc id="627759" wikidata="Q1638386" url="?curid=627759" title="Kenora District">
<text>Kenora District is a district and census division in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. The district seat is the City of Kenora.

It is geographically the largest division in Ontario: at , it covers 38 percent of the province&#x27;s area, making it larger than Newfoundland and Labrador, and slightly smaller than Sweden or roughly the land size of California. Kenora District also has the lowest population density of any of Ontario&#x27;s census divisions (it ranks 37th out of 50 by total population).

The district was created in 1907 from parts of Rainy River District. The northern part (north of the Albany River) only became part of Ontario in 1912 (transferred from the Northwest Territories). The separate Patricia District upon transfer, it was in 1937 annexed to Kenora District and known sometimes as the Patricia Portion.

==Politics==

As with the other districts of Northern Ontario, the Kenora District does not have an organized government like those of counties or regional municipalities in Southern Ontario. All government services in the district are instead provided by the local municipalities, by local services boards in some unincorporated communities, or directly by the provincial government.

==Geography==

The climate is very harsh because of the influence of the cold waters of Hudson and James Bays: most of the region is taiga characterized by discontinuous permafrost, but on the extreme northern coast there are – remarkably for a latitude of only 54°N – patches of true Arctic tundra and continuous permafrost. This is the southernmost point in the Northern Hemisphere reached by the circumpolar line of continuous permafrost on any continent.

Kenora District is geographically extensive enough to share borders with both the contiguous United States (the boundary between it and the Northwest Angle is located in the Lake of the Woods) and the Canadian Arctic waters (Hudson Bay), the only district in Canada to do so.

The District contains the Sturgeon Lake Caldera, which is one of the world&#x27;s best preserved Neoarchean caldera complexes and is some 2.7 billion years old.

===Patricia Portion===

The Patricia Portion is the part of the Kenora District lying north of the Albany River, which was transferred from the Northwest Territories to Ontario on May 15, 1912, in &quot;The Ontario Boundaries Extension Act&quot;. This area was originally a separate division, Patricia District, but became part of Kenora District in 1937.

With the exception of a few communities along the northernmost ends of Highway 599 and the Highway 105/Highway 125 corridor, the Patricia Portion consists almost entirely of remote First Nations communities that are only accessible by float plane or winter road. Accordingly, the term &quot;Patricia Portion&quot; is still sometimes used to distinguish the region from the relatively more populated and road-accessible southern portion.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Kenora District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Economy==
Most of the population is concentrated in the district&#x27;s extreme south where some agriculture is possible: the main crop is barley. Traditional native activities such as hunting and fishing dominate the north of the district outside of mining settlements.

=== Mining ===
The area near Lake Minnehaha saw a gold rush between 1902 and 1909. The settlement of Gold Rock served 14 area mines, which included the Big Master, Laurentian, Detola and Elora. According to Barnes, &quot;Approximately 180,000 ounces of gold was won from 27 mines in the Kenora district from 1880 to 1976,&quot; with &quot;over 331 known gold occurrences.&quot; The more successful mines included the Bully Boy, Cameron Island, Champion, Combined, Cornucopia, Gold Hill, Golden Horn, Kenricia, Mikado, Oliver, Olympia, Ophyr, Regina, Scramble, Severn, Stella, Sultana, Treasure and Wendigo.

Mining is currently extremely extensive in northern Kenora District, which contains some of the world&#x27;s largest and highest-grade reserves of uranium and some of the world&#x27;s major producers of nickel. A major mining exploration project is currently underway in the Ring of Fire region, centred on the district&#x27;s isolated McFaulds Lake.

==Transportation==

Permanent roads (Highway 599) only reach about halfway to the northernmost point of Kenora district, with the provincial highway network ending at Pickle Lake. Some more northerly communities connect seasonally through an ice/winter road network to the Northern Ontario Resource Trail.

Year-round air and summertime river transport are the only means of reaching the most remote parts of the district.

The major railroad lines between Toronto and British Columbia pass through the south of the district. The district is served by Via Rail&#x27;s &quot;Canadian&quot; at Rice Lake, Copelands Landing, Malachi, Ottermere, Minaki, Redditt, Farlane station, Canyon, Red Lake Road, Richan, and Sioux Lookout stations.

<text>Vincent Jules Auriol (; 27 August 1884 – 1 January 1966) was a French politician who served as President of France from 1947 to 1954.

==Early life and politics==
Auriol was born in Revel, Haute-Garonne, as the only child of Jacques Antoine Auriol (1855–1933), a baker nicknamed Paul, and Angélique Virginie Durand (1861–1945). His great-grandmother, Anne Auriol, was a first cousin of English engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel. He earned a law degree at the Collège de Revel in 1904 and began his career as a lawyer in Toulouse. A committed socialist, Auriol co-founded the newspaper &quot;Le Midi Socialiste&quot; in 1908; he was head of the Association of Journalists in Toulouse at this time.

In 1914, Auriol entered the Chamber of Deputies as a Socialist Deputy for Muret, a position he retained until 1942. He also served as Mayor of Muret from 3 May 1925 to 17 January 1947, and as a member of the Conseil Général of Haute-Garonne from 1928 to 17 January 1947. In December 1920, after the breakup of the SFIO, Auriol refused to join the newly created SFIC and became one of the leaders of the new SFIO (the remaining socialist minority), along with Léon Blum.
Auriol became the party&#x27;s leading spokesman on financial issues. He chaired the Finance Committee in the Chamber of Deputies from 1924 to 1926. His first cabinet post was as Minister of Finance under Léon Blum, in which Auriol controversially devalued the French franc 30% against the United States dollar, leading to capital flight and greater economic unease. This and Blum&#x27;s proposals for greater regulatory restrictions on industry led to Blum&#x27;s resignation as Premier; in the next government, led by Camille Chautemps, Auriol was made Minister of Justice, then later he was appointed as Minister of Coordination of Services of the Presidency of the Council in Blum&#x27;s short-lived government in 1938. Édouard Daladier&#x27;s conservative–Radical government formed on 10 April 1938 returned Auriol to the Chamber of Deputies.

Auriol was one of the 80 deputies who voted against the extraordinary powers given to Prime Minister Philippe Pétain on 10 July 1940 that brought about the Nazi-backed Vichy government. As a result, he was placed under house arrest until he escaped to the French Resistance in October 1942, and fought with the resistance for a year. Auriol fled to London in October 1943. He represented the Socialists at the Free French Consultative Assembly (organized by Charles de Gaulle in Algiers later that year). In July 1944, he represented France at the United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods, United States.

==Postwar life and presidency==
After World War II, Auriol served as Minister of State in de Gaulle&#x27;s provisional government. He was a member of the Constituent Assemblies which drafted the constitution of the short-lived French Fourth Republic, and was President of the Assemblies. He lobbied for a &quot;third force&quot; as an alternative to both Communism and Gaullism. Auriol led the French delegation to the United Nations and was France&#x27;s first representative on the United Nations Security Council in 1946. He served as a Deputy for Haute-Garonne in the National Assembly from 1946 until 31 December 1947. Meanwhile, the National Assembly elected him on 16 January 1947 as the first President of the Fourth Republic by a wide margin, receiving 452 votes (51.19%) against the 242 (27.41%) for the People&#x27;s Republican Movement (MRP) candidate, Auguste Champetier de Ribes.
As president, Auriol pursued a relatively weak presidency like the office under the Third Republic. He attempted to reconcile political factions within France and warm relations between France and its allies. He was criticized for France&#x27;s ailing economy and political turmoil in the postwar period, and the war in Indochina. A series of debilitating strikes were waged across France in 1947, initiated by the Confédération Générale du Travail. The strikes escalated into violence in November of that year, leading, on 28 November, to the government deploying 80,000 French Army reservists to face the &quot;insurrection&quot;. The Communist Party, who often supported the strikes, were expelled from the legislature in early December. The strikes ended on 10 December, but more would come in 1948, and again in 1953 in response to the Joseph Laniel government&#x27;s austerity program.

Apart from the inconclusive war in Indochina, France&#x27;s colonial empire decayed under Auriol&#x27;s presidency. Clashes in Morocco, Madagascar, Algeria, and Tunisia became more frequent; an Algerian independence movement, the Front de Libération Nationale, was founded in 1951, and in 1953 the French overthrew Mohammed V, the Sultan of Morocco, after he demanded greater autonomy. France fought an uprising in Madagascar and imprisoned Tunisian independence leader Habib Bourguiba in 1952.

When Auriol&#x27;s term as president expired, he did not run for re-election, and was succeeded by René Coty as President of France on 16 January 1954. Auriol commented on leaving office: &quot;The work was killing me; they called me out of bed at all hours of the night to receive resignations of prime ministers&quot; (there were eighteen different governments during his seven years as president.)

After his presidency, Auriol assumed the role of elder statesman, and wrote articles on political topics. Auriol became a member of the Constitutional Council of France in 1958 at the establishment of the French Fifth Republic; he resigned from the SFIO in the same year. He unsuccessfully lobbied against the constitution in the 1958 national referendum, and resigned from his position on the Constitutional Council in 1960 to protest the growing power of Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s presidency. In 1965, he endorsed François Mitterrand for the presidency.

On 1 January 1966, Vincent Auriol died in hospital in the 7th arrondissement of Paris and was buried at Muret, Haute-Garonne.

==Personal life==
On 1 June 1911, Auriol married Michelle Aucoutuier (5 March 1895 – 21 January 1979). Around seven to eight years later, the couple had a son, Paul (1919–1992) and the aviator Jacqueline Auriol was his daughter-in-law.

<text>Grey County is a county in the province of Ontario. The county is located in the Southwestern Ontario region, and is a part of the Georgian Triangle. At the time of the 2021 Canadian census the population of the county was 100,905. Owen Sound is the county seat and the largest city in Grey County.

==Administrative divisions==
Grey County consists of the following municipalities (in order of population):

==History==
===Origin and evolution===
The first European settlement was in the vicinity of Collingwood or Meaford. Exploring parties arrived from York in 1825 by travelling from Holland Landing and down the Holland River into Lake Simcoe and Shanty Bay. From there they travelled by land to the Nottawasaga River into Georgian Bay and along the thickly wooded shore.

In 1837 the village of Sydenham was surveyed by Charles Rankin. In 1856 it was incorporated as the Town of Owen Sound with an estimated population of 2,000.

In 1840, the area became part of the new District of Wellington, and its territory formed the County of Waterloo for electoral purposes. In 1849, Wellington District was abolished, and Waterloo County remained for municipal and judicial purposes. The territory of the Bruce Peninsula became part of Waterloo in 1849, but was later withdrawn and transferred to Bruce County in 1851.

In January 1852, Waterloo County became the United Counties of Wellington, Waterloo and Grey. Grey County was named in honour of the British Colonial Secretary&#x27;s father, Charles Grey, 2nd Earl Grey, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1830-1834. Its territory was declared to consist of the following townships, together with part of the Indian Reserves on the Bruce Peninsula:
* Artemesia
* Bentinck
* Collingwood
* Derby
* Egremont
* Euphrasia
* Glenelg
* Holland
* Melancthon
* Normanby
* Osprey
* Proton
* Saint Vincent
* Sullivan
* Sydenham
The Indian lands were later surveyed and became the townships of Keppel and Sarawak. A Provisional Municipal Council was organized for the County in April 1852, with the Town of Sydenham named as the county town.

Waterloo was withdrawn from the United Counties in January 1853, and the remainder was renamed the United Counties of Wellington and Grey. In January 1854, the United Counties was dissolved, and Wellington and Grey were separate counties for all purposes.

In 1861-1862 the first gravel roads were constructed into Owen Sound at a cost of $300,000. The four colonization roads were:

:* the Garafraxa Road running from Fergus to Owen Sound (now Highway 6);
:* the Durham Road leading east and west from the village of Durham (formerly part of Highway 4, and now County Road 4);
:* the Lake Shore Road from Collingwood to Owen Sound (now Highway 26); and
:* the Toronto-Sydenham Road leading from Shelburne to Owen Sound (now Highway 10).

Prior to the road building it often took two days to walk up to Owen Sound.

In 1881, the township of Melancthon and the village of Shelburne were withdrawn from Grey and transferred to the new Dufferin County.

On January 1, 2001, Grey County underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the reduction in number of the local municipalities:

==Demographics==

<text>Lambton County is a county in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is bordered on the north by Lake Huron, which is drained by the St. Clair River, the county&#x27;s western border and part of the Canada-United States border. To the south is Lake Saint Clair and Chatham-Kent. Lambton County&#x27;s northeastern border follows the Ausable River and Parkhill Creek north until it reaches Lake Huron at the beach community of Grand Bend. The county seat is in the Town of Plympton-Wyoming.

The largest city in Lambton County is Sarnia, which is located at the source of the St. Clair River at Lake Huron. The two Blue Water Bridges cross the river at Sarnia, connecting it to Port Huron, Michigan. The bridges are one of the busiest border crossings between the two countries. The river is also traversed by one passenger ferry further south, and a rail tunnel, also at Sarnia, runs underneath it. The CN rail tunnel accommodates double stacked rail cars. Along with Sarnia, the population centres in Lambton County are: Corunna, Petrolia, Grand Bend, Wyoming, Forest, and Watford.

Lambton County started as a part of the District of Hesse. The district of Hesse included British territories west of Long Point (practically all of western Ontario). The district was later divided and renamed using English district names (Essex, Suffolk, Kent, etc.). Lambton was part of Kent county. In 1849 districts were abolished and the County of Lambton was formed. Lambton and Kent first shared the capital city of Sandwich (since renamed as Windsor, Ontario). In 1852 the partnership was dissolved and Lambton become a full county. It is named in honour of John Lambton, 1st Earl of Durham, who visited the area in the late 1830s.

Lambton County is the site of North America&#x27;s first drilled commercial oil well at Oil Springs in 1858.

Tourism is another important industry in Lambton County, especially along the lake and river. The community of Grand Bend and the Pinery Provincial Park are especially popular tourist destinations, attracting thousands of people each week throughout the summer to their long, uninterrupted beaches. The part of Lambton County along Lake Huron known as Lambton Shores depends almost entirely upon the seasonal industries of tourism and agriculture for its well-being. There are also popular conservation areas along the St. Clair River, and a conservation area named Rock Glen Falls near Arkona along the Ausauble River internationally known for its Devonian period fossils.

<text>Janet Louise Yellen (born August 13, 1946) is an American economist who served as the 78th United States secretary of the treasury from 2021 to 2025. She also served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018. She was the first woman to hold either position, and has also led the White House Council of Economic Advisers. Yellen is the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Born and raised in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, Yellen graduated from Brown University in 1967 and earned a Ph.D. in economics from Yale University in 1971. She taught as an assistant professor at Harvard University from 1971 to 1976, was a staff economist for the Federal Reserve Board from 1977 to 1978, and was a faculty member at the London School of Economics from 1978 to 1980. Yellen is professor emeritus at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, where she has been a faculty member since 1980 and became the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics.

Yellen served as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors from 1994 to 1997 and was nominated to the position by President Bill Clinton, who then named her chair of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1997 to 1999. She subsequently returned to academia, before serving as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco from 2004 until 2010. Afterward, President Barack Obama chose her to replace Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve from 2010 to 2014 before nominating her to succeed Ben Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve three years later. She was succeeded by Jerome Powell after President Donald Trump declined to renominate her for a second term. Following her departure from the Federal Reserve, Yellen joined the Brookings Institution as a distinguished fellow in residence from 2018 until 2020, when she again went into public service.

On November 30, 2020, President-elect Joe Biden nominated Yellen to serve as secretary of the treasury; she was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on January 25, 2021, and was sworn in by Vice President Kamala Harris the following day.

== Early life and education ==
Yellen was born on August 13, 1946, to a family of Polish Jewish ancestry in the Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, neighborhood of New York City, and grew up there. Her mother was Anna Ruth (née Blumenthal; 1907–1986), an elementary school teacher who gave up her teaching job to become a stay-at-home mother. Her father was Julius Yellen (1906–1975), a family physician who worked from the ground floor of their house. Janet has an older brother, John (born 1942), who is a program director for archaeology at the National Science Foundation.

In a speech at the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews, Yellen said that her father&#x27;s family immigrated to the United States from Sokołów Podlaski, a small town about 50 miles outside of Warsaw. She said further that nearly the entirety of its Jewish population, including many of her relatives, was deported or murdered during the Holocaust.

Yellen attended the local Fort Hamilton High School, where she was an honor society member and participated in the booster club, the psychology club, and the history club. She also served as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Pilot&quot;, the school newspaper, which continued its 13-year streak as the first-place winner of the prestigious Columbia Scholastic Press Association contest under her leadership. She earned a National Merit commendation letter and was admitted to a selective science honors program at Columbia University to voluntarily study mathematics on Saturday mornings. Yellen was one of 30 students to win state Regents scholarships for college and one of a select few to win the mayor&#x27;s citation for a scholarship. She graduated in 1963 as the valedictorian of her class. In line with school tradition, for the editor to interview the valedictorian, she interviewed herself in the third person.

Yellen enrolled at Pembroke College in Brown University, initially intending to study philosophy. During her freshman year, she switched her planned major to economics and was particularly influenced by professors George Herbert Borts and Herschel Grossman. In the spring of 1964, she also joined the business staff of &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot;, but soon afterward she left the paper to focus on her academic studies. Yellen graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor&#x27;s in economics from Brown University in 1967, and earned her master&#x27;s and PhD in economics from Yale University in 1971. Her dissertation was titled &quot;Employment, Output and Capital Accumulation in an Open Economy: A Disequilibrium Approach&quot; under the supervision of James Tobin, a noted economist who would later receive the Nobel Memorial Prize. As a teaching assistant, Yellen was so meticulous in her note-taking during Tobin&#x27;s macroeconomics class that her notes became the unofficial textbook and were referred to as &quot;Yellen Notes&quot; while being circulated among generations of graduate students. Her former professor and Nobel Prize in Economics laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, has called her one of his brightest and most memorable students. She later described Yale professors Tobin and William Brainard as &quot;lifelong mentors&quot; who laid the intellectual groundwork for her economic views. Yellen was the only woman among the two dozen economists who earned their doctorates from Yale in 1971.

== Academic career ==
After receiving her Ph.D., Yellen obtained the position of assistant professor of economics at Harvard University, where she taught from 1971 to 1976. At that time, she was one of only two female faculty members in Harvard&#x27;s economics department; the other woman was Rachel McCulloch. The pair struck up a close friendship and went on to write several academic papers together. In 1977, Yellen took a job within the Federal Reserve&#x27;s Board of Governors after failing to win tenure at Harvard; she was recruited as a staff economist for the Board of Governors by Edwin M. Truman, who had known her from Yale. Truman was a junior professor when he heard Yellen&#x27;s oral exam and was then about to take over the Fed&#x27;s Division of International Finance. She was assigned to research international monetary reform.

While at the Fed, she met her husband, economist George Akerlof, in the bank&#x27;s cafeteria; they married in 1978, less than a year later. By the time of their marriage, Akerlof had already accepted a teaching position at the London School of Economics (LSE). Yellen left her post at the Fed to accompany him and was given a tenure-track lectureship by LSE. The couple stayed in the United Kingdom for two years before returning to the United States, in part due to identity issues because they felt American, not English.

In 1980, Yellen joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley, where she taught at the Haas School of Business to conduct macroeconomics research and teach undergraduate and MBA students for more than two decades. She earned the Haas School&#x27;s outstanding teaching award twice, in 1985 and 1988. Yellen became just the second woman at Berkeley-Haas to earn tenure in 1982, as well as the title of full professor in 1985. She was named the Bernard T. Rocca Jr. Professor of International Business and Trade in 1992.

From 1994 to 1999, Yellen took a leave of absence from Berkeley to go into public service. After returning to academia, she resumed her teaching assignment at Haas and received a joint appointment with Berkeley&#x27;s Department of Economics. She was appointed the Eugene E. and Catherine M. Trefethen Professor of Business Administration and Professor of Economics in 1999 and remained an active faculty member until she was appointed president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco in 2004. Yellen was awarded the title of professor emeritus at UC Berkeley in 2006.
Throughout her career, Yellen served as an adviser to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Brookings Panel on Economic Activity, and the National Science Foundation&#x27;s Panel in Economics. She was also a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research from 1999 to 2010.

=== Contributions to economics ===
Yellen&#x27;s academic career has largely focused on the analysis of the mechanisms of unemployment and labor markets, monetary and fiscal policies, and international trade. She has written a few widely cited papers, often collaborating on research with her husband, Professor George Akerlof.

==== Efficiency wage models ====
Since the 1980s, Yellen and Akerlof have addressed what&#x27;s known in the economics literature as &quot;efficiency wage theory&quot;the idea that paying people more than the market wage does increase their productivity. Their 1990 paper, entitled &quot;The Fair-Wage Effort Hypothesis and Unemployment&quot;, coined &quot;the fair wage effort hypothesis&quot; and was considered by economists to be a significant contribution to the topic: &quot;A precursor to the efficiency wage literature...it had an influence, although the work on efficiency wage theory has had a bigger influence.&quot; Akerlof and Yellen introduced the gift-exchange game, which argues that workers who are paid less than what they consider to be a fair wage will purposefully work less hard to exact revenge on their employer.

==== Reproductive technology shock ====
Another work, &quot;An Analysis of Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing in the United States&quot;, co-written with Akerlof and Michael Katz and published in 1996, aims to explain why out-of-wedlock births have grown considerably in previous decades in the United States. A research study led to a theory called &quot;reproductive technology shock&quot;, arguing that the increased availability of both abortion and contraception in the late 1960s and early 1970s, amidst the sexual revolution, eroded the social norms surrounding sex, pregnancy, and marriage, leading to a sharp decline in the stigma of unwed motherhood. At the same time, this transformation encouraged biological fathers to reject notions of marital and paternal obligations.

== Federal Reserve (1994–1997) ==
On April 22, 1994, President Bill Clinton announced his intention to nominate Yellen as a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, alongside Alan Blinder, who has been designated as vice chairman. They were the first Democratic appointees to the Board since 1980. In an issued statement, the president praised her as &quot;one of the most prominent economists of her generation on the intersection of macroeconomics and labor markets.&quot; President Clinton played an indirect role in the selection process, delegating most of the responsibility to NEC Director Robert Rubin, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, and CEA Chair Laura Tyson, who was a colleague of Yellen&#x27;s at Berkeley. The group settled on her candidacy after an exhaustive search that at one point included nearly 50 names. In July 1994, during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Yellen said that Fed policies should keep the economy growing as much as possible without accelerating inflation but avoid taking a clear position on the prospect of further increases in interest rates. The Senate panel approved her nomination without much Republican opposition, by a vote of 18 to 1; the only dissenting vote came from Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), who said that her concerns should be limited to inflation. The nomination was confirmed in the full United States Senate by a vote of 94–6. On August 12, 1994, Yellen was appointed to a full 14-year term and assumed the seat vacated by Republican Wayne Angell. She was installed as the fourth female governor, joining Susan M. Phillips, which marks the first time that two women have sat on the Federal Reserve Board simultaneously.

In July 1996, the Federal Reserve resisted pressure to raise interest rates as unemployment dropped. Yellen marshaled academic research to dissuade Chairman Alan Greenspan from committing the Fed to a zero inflation policy and demonstrate that the central bank should seek to moderate inflation rather than eliminate it. According to the study, a low inflation rate of around 2 percent provided a better foundation for reducing unemployment and increasing economic growth than the goal of zero.

Upon her confirmation as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, she resigned as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System on February 17, 1997.

== Council of Economic Advisers (1997–1999) ==

On December 20, 1996, Yellen joined the Clinton administration as chair of President Clinton&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), replacing Joseph Stiglitz in office. She was reluctant to leave the Federal Reserve, but White House officials talked her into a job, passing over others with greater marquee value because, as Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said, &quot;We wanted someone who could bring a rigorous analytic approach to the issues and who could work well with others.&quot; Yellen was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on February 13, 1997, thereby becoming the second woman to serve as chief economic advisor to the president after Laura Tyson. While serving within the Administration, she concurrently chaired the OECD Economic Policy Committee from 1997 to 1999.

During her time with the Council of Economic Advisers, Yellen oversaw a June 1998 report, &quot;Explaining Trends in the Gender Wage Gap&quot;, which focused on the gender pay divide. Within this study, the Council analyzed data from 1969 to 1996 to determine the reasons why women earn substantially less than men. By observing trends attributable to issues such as occupation and industry, as well as familial status, it was determined that while the Equal Pay Act of 1963 was a step forward, there was no explanation for a 25-percent difference between average pay for women and men – an improvement from the 40-percent gap two decades earlier. It was concluded that this gap had no correlation with differences in productivity and, as such, was the result of discrimination within the workforce.

In June 1999, Yellen announced that she was stepping down from the CEA for personal reasons and would return to teaching at UC Berkeley. It was reported that President Clinton asked her to take over from Alice Rivlin, the central bank&#x27;s vice chairwoman – an offer she turned down.

== Return to the Federal Reserve (2004–2018) ==
=== Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ===
On April 12, 2004, the Federal Reserve announced that Yellen would replace Robert T. Parry as president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, taking office on June 14. She was the first woman to hold this position. While serving as Federal Reserve District president, she sat on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and was a voting member once every three years on a rotating basis, with her first being in 2006. During her time at the San Francisco Fed, the largest of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks in terms of population and economic output, Yellen publicly downplayed concerns about the potential consequences of the boom in housing prices; at FOMC meetings, on the contrary, she sounded the alarm on banks&#x27; heavy concentration in risky construction and home-development loans. On the other hand, she did not lead the San Francisco Fed to &quot;move to check [the] increasingly indiscriminate lending&quot; of Countrywide Financial, the United States&#x27; largest lender.

On June 5, 2009, Yellen said that the Federal Reserve should consider raising interest rates earlier to prevent another housing bubble. She argued that higher short-term interest rates probably went against the expansion of a bubble in certain circumstances, like restraining the demand for housing and high-risk mortgages.

In July 2009, Yellen was mentioned as a potential successor to Chairman Ben Bernanke when his term was set to expire before he was re-nominated for a second four-year term. She eventually emerged as the leading contender for vice chair of the Federal Reserve Board in March 2010, and following her Senate confirmation, she resigned from the San Francisco Fed in October of that year.

=== Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve ===

On April 28, 2010, President Barack Obama nominated Yellen to succeed Donald Kohn as vice chair of the Federal Reserve. In July 2010, the Senate Banking Committee voted 17–6 to confirm her, though the top Republican on the panel, Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, voted no, saying &quot;President Yellen presided over a regional housing bubble and failed to restrain the excesses.&quot;

Around the same time, on the heels of related testimony by Fed chairman Bernanke, FOMC voting member James B. Bullard of the St. Louis Fed stated that the U.S. economy was at risk of becoming &quot;enmeshed in a Japanese-style deflationary outcome within the next several years.&quot; That statement was interpreted as a possible shift within the FOMC balance between inflation hawks and doves. Yellen&#x27;s pending confirmation, along with those of Peter Diamond and Sarah Bloom Raskin to fill vacancies, was seen as possibly furthering such a shift in the FOMC. All three nominations were seen as &quot;on track to be confirmed by the Senate.&quot;

On September 29, 2010, Yellen, along with Raskin, was confirmed by the Senate on a voice vote to be both a member of the board of governors and vice chairman of the Federal Reserve System. On October 4, the pair were sworn in as Fed governors, while Yellen also took the oath of office as vice chair of the board for a four-year term. Simultaneously, she began a 14-year term as a member of the Federal Reserve Board, filling a vacant seat last held by Mark W. Olson. Yellen was just the second woman to hold the Federal Reserve&#x27;s No.2 post, after Alice Rivlin.

In contrast to her predecessors, Yellen acted more independently within the institution in her role as vice chair. She has been urging Bernanke and the other FOMC members to follow her preferred route for monetary policy, arguing for more forceful actions to inject money into the economy to reduce unemployment. Yellen played a leading role in moving the Federal Reserve to announce its inflation target of two percent a year after her long campaign with Chairman Bernanke; she was an early supporter of inflation targeting, facing opposition from Chairman Greenspan during her first stint at the Fed in the 1990s.

Yellen was widely considered the front-runner to succeed Bernanke as the Federal Reserve&#x27;s chair when his second term ceased. Lawrence Summers, a former President Clinton&#x27;s Treasury Secretary and former director of President Obama&#x27;s National Economic Council, was the other leading contender in the highly publicized race; media outlets reported that the president was leaning toward selecting the latter candidate. However, throughout the race, Summers drew criticism from both sides of the aisle for his role in deregulating parts of the banking sector while he served in the Clinton administration. He sparked further controversy for remarks on women&#x27;s aptitude in math and science, which he made in 2005 while serving as Harvard University&#x27;s president. In July 2013, Yellen was pushed to be named the first chairwoman of the central bank in a letter that was circulated among the Senate Democrats and had been signed by almost a third of the 54 caucus senators, who primarily represent the liberal wing of the party. In addition, more than 500 professional economists from around 200 colleges and universities across the United States signed an open letter in support of her candidacy for Fed chair and sent it to the White House. After weeks of opposition to his potential nomination, Summers withdrew his name from consideration for the position in September.

=== Chair of the Federal Reserve ===

On October 9, 2013, Yellen was officially nominated to replace Bernanke as chair of the Federal Reserve, the first vice chair ever to be elevated to that post. While announcing his decision, President Obama called her &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s foremost economists and policymakers&quot; and said that &quot;America&#x27;s workers and their families will have a champion in Janet Yellen.&quot; During the nomination hearings held in November, Yellen defended the more than $3 trillion in stimulus funds that the central bank had been injecting into the U.S. economy. She also said that it is important for the Fed to try to detect asset bubbles and that if she saw one, she would work to address it.

On December 20, 2013, the U.S. Senate voted 59–34 for cloture on Yellen&#x27;s nomination. On January 6, 2014, she was confirmed as chair of the Federal Reserve by a vote of 56–26, the narrowest margin ever for the position. Yellen was a trailblazer as the first woman to head the U.S. central bank, or any major central bank, and the first Democrat to do so since Paul Volcker assumed that position in 1979 via President Jimmy Carter. She was sworn into office on February 3, 2014, and was previously elected as FOMC chair on January 30. According to a Fed representative, on Yellen&#x27;s request, her title would be altered to &quot;chair&quot; rather than &quot;chairman&quot; or &quot;chairwoman&quot;, as she prefers a gender-neutral manner. Only one woman had ever led the central bank of a G8 country before YellenRussia&#x27;s Elvira Nabiullina.

In July 2014, at her first semi-annual congressional testimony on U S. monetary policy, Yellen said, &quot;while real estate, equities, and corporate bond prices have risen appreciably and valuation metrics have increased they were generally in line with historical norms.&quot; She also acknowledged some concerns about the valuations of lower-rated corporate debt and affirmed that she and other Fed officials were monitoring trends but did not believe that a so-called &quot;everything bubble&quot; was forming.

On December 16, 2015, the Federal Reserve under Yellen increased its key interest rate for the first time since 2006. That move was largely expected because extraordinarily low rates for an extremely long time may contribute to financial instability and pose a threat to the economy, and was considered a departure from the previous controversial Fed policy, commonly known as the &quot;Greenspan put&quot;. During her tenure, the Fed has gradually raised rates four additional times, leaving its key rate in a still-low range of 1.25 percent to 1.5 percentwell below historical standards.

Following the 2016 presidential election, Yellen gave a strong defense of the Dodd–Frank Act in her Joint Economic Committee testimony, standing in opposition to incoming President Donald Trump&#x27;s plans to review the landmark legislation. She argued that it would be inappropriate to weaken or repeal the law designed to prevent a repeat of the global financial crisis. Yellen provided further support for financial regulations enacted in the wake of the Great Recession in a speech to the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on August 25, 2017. In her remarks about the aftermath of the crisis, she said, &quot;The balance of research suggests that the core reforms we have put in place have substantially boosted resilience without unduly limiting credit availability or economic growth.&quot; Yellen warned that any adjustment to the regulatory framework should be modest and preserve the increase in resilience.
In November 2017, as Yellen&#x27;s tenure as chair of the Federal Reserve was coming to an end, Trump considered nominating her for another term, but on the advice of his Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, he picked a Republican Fed governor, Jerome Powell, instead. Yellen made her resignation from the Federal Reserve Board at the conclusion of her chairmanship known after Trump&#x27;s choice, despite still having her assignment as Fed governor until 2024. She served a single term and became just the second Federal Reserve chair eligible for reappointment not renominated by a successor presidential administration, the first being Arthur F. Burns almost 40 years prior. That unusual departure makes her the briefest-serving central bank chief since G. William Miller, who held that office for over a year, from 1978 to 1979.

On February 2, 2018, Yellen enforced enormous sanctions on Wells Fargo, which was the third-largest U.S. bank at the time, with a consent order restricting the firm&#x27;s expansion unless it resolved its internal issues. That move came in response to a string of &quot;widespread consumer abuses and compliance breakdowns&quot; at the company, particularly a fake account scandal, and marked the first time the Fed has imposed a cap on the entire assets of a financial institution.

Regarding labor markets, Yellen has been dubbed one of the Federal Reserve System&#x27;s most successful chairpersons. During her term, the unemployment rate dropped from 6.7 percent to 4.1 percent, the lowest in 17 years. For the first time since central bank creation, the economy added jobs throughout every month of any Fed chair&#x27;s tenure. Yellen completed her time at the Fed with the lowest final unemployment rate of any Fed chair since William McChesney Martin in 1970. Under her leadership, the U.S. unemployment rate fell more than during any other chair&#x27;s term in the post-World War II era, declining 2.6 percentage points. On the other hand, inflation remained below the Fed&#x27;s annual two percent target, which led to the suggestion that the central bank could have done even more to bolster the economy without the risk of price increases.

Yellen became the first person in U.S. central bank history to have served as a Federal Reserve chair (2014–2018), vice chair (2010–2014), district president (FRB of San Francisco, 2004–2010), Fed governor (1994–1997 and 2010–2018), and staff economist (1977–1978).

== After the Federal Reserve (2018–2020) ==

On February 2, 2018, the Brookings Institution announced that Yellen would join the think tank as a distinguished fellow in residence with the Economic Studies program, effective February 5, 2018. She&#x27;s been affiliated with the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings. On July 31, 2018, the Hutchins Center announced Yellen, James H. Stock, and Louise Sheiner as co-chairs of the newly launched Productivity Measurement Initiative, aimed at improving the quality of economic statistics.

In November 2020, Yellen left her position at Brookings after being selected as a nominee to serve as Treasury secretary. Within the think tank, she has been providing expertise and commentary on a range of economic issues, offering her perspective and analysis at Brookings panels, congressional testimony, lectures across the United States and abroad, and regularly serving as a commentator in the media.

On June 27, 2017, Yellen stated that she did not expect another financial crisis &quot;in our lifetime&quot; because she thought banks were &quot;much stronger&quot; as a result of Federal Reserve oversight. In a December 10, 2018 conversation with Paul Krugman at the City University of New York, she warned of the possibility of another financial crisis by citing &quot;gigantic holes in the system&quot; after she departs from the Federal Reserve.

On February 25, 2019, in an interview with &quot;Marketplace&quot;, when asked if she believed Trump has &quot;a grasp of macroeconomic policy,&quot; Yellen replied, &quot;No, I do not.&quot; She expressed her doubts about the president&#x27;s ability to articulate the Federal Reserve&#x27;s explicit goals of &quot;maximum employment and price stability&quot; and emphasized his assertions that the Federal Reserve&#x27;s goals include trade, which she explains are objectively false. She raised further concern over Trump&#x27;s regard for the independence of the central bank and voiced support for her successor, Jerome Powell. This interview marked a notable change in tone for Yellen, who traditionally handled her differences with the president in a neutral manner.

On July 17, 2020, at the hearing of the House Select Oversight Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, which was set up by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, former Federal Reserve chairs Bernanke and Yellen testified about the economic policy response to the negative impact of the coronavirus pandemic. They urged lawmakers to act aggressively with fiscal stimulus in three areas: extending the supplementary unemployment payments; providing additional financial assistance to hard-hit states and local governments; and investing in the medical response to the pandemic. She also expressed this commitment to stimulus in an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; with Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In August 2020, it was reported that Yellen was among a handful of economists who briefed former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, and his chosen running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, on economic issues. The meeting was one of the first times the Biden campaign announced its economic expert, whom few at the time predicted would take a presidential cabinet post.

=== Paid corporate speaking ===
Between 2018 and 2020, Yellen received $7.2million in speaking fees for 50 speeches at various Wall Street, technology and consulting companies. This included $1 million for giving nine speeches to Citi and $800,000 from the hedge fund Citadel LLC, as well as other paid speeches with Wall Street companies Barclays, Goldman Sachs, UBS and Credit Suisse. Paid speeches with technology companies included Google and Salesforce.

With her return to government, she pledged to get official permission from the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to participate in substantive issues involving such firms to avoid any conflict of interest.

== Secretary of the Treasury (2021–2025) ==
===Nomination and confirmation===

Following the 2020 presidential election, Yellen was routinely mentioned as a possible secretary of the treasury in the incoming Biden administration. She edged out other top contenders to obtain the position, including Fed Board Gov. Lael Brainard and Roger W. Ferguson Jr., a former central bank vice chairman.

On November 30, 2020, then-President-elect Biden announced he would nominate Yellen as Treasury Secretary in his cabinet. In his remarks on the announcement, Biden lauded her as &quot;one of the most important economic thinkers of our time&quot; who &quot;spent her career focused on employment and the dignity of work.&quot; Despite being a highly respected figure across the political spectrum and expected to win confirmation easily, she was considered an unusual pick for the position because of her lack of experience in political maneuvering. Unlike her predecessors, she is viewed as more of an academic economist than a traditional politician used to horse-trading and dealmaking, qualities that could be critical to achieving the goals of Biden&#x27;s economic agenda in a deeply partisan Congress. All living former U.S. treasury secretaries, from George Shultz to Jack Lew, endorsed Yellen for the position in a bipartisan letter calling on the Senate to swiftly confirm her.

The Senate Finance Committee unanimously approved Yellen&#x27;s candidacy by a 26–0 vote on January 22, 2021. The full U.S. Senate confirmed her nomination with a vote of 84–15 (with one abstention, Marco Rubio, R-FL) on January 25. With her oath of office administered by Vice President Harris the next day, Yellen became the first female Secretary of the Treasury and the first person in American history to lead the three most powerful economic bodies in the federal government of the United States: the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve, and the White House Council of Economic Advisers.

Only three other women within the G7 nationsFrance&#x27;s Christine Lagarde, Canada&#x27;s Chrystia Freeland and the United Kingdom&#x27;s Rachel Reeveshave held positions analogous to Yellen&#x27;s as Treasury Secretary. Yellen and Lynn Malerba signing currency during Yellen&#x27;s time as Treasury Secretary also marked the first time two women signed U.S. currency.

===Tenure===
====Proposed international tax reform====
In April 2021, Yellen proposed a global minimum corporate tax rate that would prevent profit shifting by multinational companies for tax avoidance. In an accompanying written piece for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, she outlined the enormous benefits of the discussed tax system for the US economy as well as the global economy. On June 5, 2021, finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) agreed to reinstate a minimum worldwide corporate tax rate of at least 15% as part of a landmark deal to modernize the international tax system, while 
France&#x27;s Bruno Le Maire called it &quot;a starting point&quot; that could be increased in the future. A few days later, Treasury Secretary Yellen co-wrote an op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; with four of her international counterparts, describing the new agreement as &quot;an historic opportunity to end the race to the bottom in corporate taxation, restoring government resources at a time when they are most needed.&quot; The next month, financial leaders from the G20 countries came to an agreement on plans to put an end to global tax havens, force multinational corporations to pay an appropriate share of tax wherever they operate, and create a &quot;more stable and fair international tax architecture.&quot;

In October 2021, more than 130 countries, accounting for more than 90% of global GDP, including several low-tax jurisdictions that had previously fought the pact, enforced through the OECD a landmark agreement to establish a global minimum tax rate of 15% for businesses worldwide. The projected gain from the deal, which was anticipated to take effect in 2023, would result in an increase of $150billion in annual tax revenues. The treaty&#x27;s implementation path remained uncertain because its ratification requires a two-thirds majority in the evenly divided U.S. Senate as well as passing domestic legislation in each of the signed countries.

====Debt ceiling crisis====
On July 23, 2021, Yellen sent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other congressional leaders in which she urged lawmakers to increase or suspend the nation&#x27;s debt limit as soon as possible before it hit its statutory limit in August and the government would be unable to pay its bills. She warned Congress that failing to meet those financial obligations would cause &quot;irreparable harm&quot; to the U.S. economy and that the Treasury Department would take &quot;extraordinary measures&quot; to prevent the United States from suffering a government shutdown or even a debt default.

On September 19, 2021, Yellen, in an op-ed for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, again called for an increase in the debt ceiling; otherwise, sometime in October, the Treasury expected to exhaust its cash reserves, which would trigger a financial crisis. After lawmakers adopted a short-term debt ceiling bill to raise the United States&#x27; borrowing limit through early December, she said that a longer-term measure should be provided to ensure certainty in government&#x27;s solvency. In November, Yellen expressed her willingness to consider solutions to the debt crisis without GOP support if necessary, using a budget reconciliation as a viable alternative. She also supported the idea for Democrats to raise the debt limit high enough that it would not be reached until after the 2024 general elections while the party holds a majority in both houses of Congress, therefore preventing the issue from being weaponized for political reasons.

In December 2021, President Biden signed a debt ceiling increase into law, preventing a U.S. default, a day after the Treasury&#x27;s previously estimated deadline to address the issue. Congressional legislation designated to cover the government&#x27;s financial commitments beyond the 2022 midterm elections was passed in a nearly party-line vote.

In January 2023, after Republicans took control over the House, Yellen informed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and new congressional leadership that the U.S. expected to hit the debt ceiling on January 19 and that the Treasury yet again would be forced to use &quot;extraordinary measures&quot; to prevent default, and it could last until June of that year. She repeated her call to &quot;act in a timely manner to increase or suspend the debt limit.&quot; Yellen rejected the GOP plan on government payments prioritization once &quot;extraordinary measures&quot; are exhausted, insisting that her department doesn&#x27;t have the systems to do so and that proposal effectively means a default.

On June 3, 2023, President Biden signed into law bipartisan congressional legislation that suspended the public debt limit throughout his first term in office, therefore ending the ongoing debt-ceiling crisis. It came as a compromise on fiscal spending between the White House and House Republicans two days before the United States was estimated to reach the debt ceiling and subsequently could no longer meet its own financial obligations.

In September 2023, Yellen said she was not worried about the $33 trillion federal government debt.

====Sanctions against Russia and oil price cap====
In November 2021, Yellen and senior Treasury personnel were tasked with crafting a sanctions strategy that would maximize the costs inflicted on Russia&#x27;s economy while limiting, if possible, 
the expected negative impact on the United States and its allies if a potential aggression began. The Treasury Department worked closely across government agencies and with US allies abroad to impose unprecedented international sanctions in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

Yellen was a key proponent of a price cap on Russian oil, a plan designed to deprive the Kremlin of funding for Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine while reducing an inflation surge by preserving the global oil supply. On December 2, 2022, following months of lobbying and negotiations by the United States, the emerging alliance of the G7 nations, the European Union, and Australia agreed to cap the price of Russian oil at $60 per barrel as an upper limit, with regular reviews to check that the ceiling stays at least 5 percent below average market prices.

====Digital Assets Regulation====
On April 7, 2022, at American University&#x27;s Kogod School of Business Center for Innovation, Yellen addressed for the first time the growing impact of digital assets on the American economy. Yellen outlined policy objectives and lessons that apply to the navigation of emerging technologies, which include &quot;first, the U.S. financial system benefits from responsible innovation; second, it&#x27;s often society&#x27;s vulnerable who suffer most in an economic crisis when regulation is not moving at the same pace as innovation; third, regulation should focus on activities and risk, not technology; fourth, sovereign money is the core of a functioning financial system; and fifth, it&#x27;ll take thoughtful public and private dialogue between various groups to move forward.&quot;

Yellen also announced possible plans for a government version of a stablecoin; the administration is studying the possibility of issuing a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or digital dollar while taking into consideration the impact of a CBDC on monetary policy, national security, and international trade, as well as its utility for consumers. Solving such problems is an &quot;engineering challenge that would require years of development, not months,&quot; she said.

====Friendshoring of supply chains====
In a speech delivered at the Atlantic Council on April 13, 2022, Yellen advised against the supply chain risks posed by reliance on commodities from countries that aligned with authoritarian regimes like Russia or China and favored friendshoring strategy, an approach that limits supply chain networks to allies and partner countries. She said that any moves from the other nations to undermine collective international effort to make Russia accountable for its aggression would draw the ire of the U.S. and its allies. Yellen also called for the modernization of international financial institutions so that they could meet the world&#x27;s 21st-century challenges, invoking precedent of the Bretton Woods Conference, which was held during the Second World War to discuss post-war economic order.

In December 2022, Yellen wrote an essay for &quot;Project Syndicate&quot; in which she singled out the key risks for the U.S. economy that may be mitigated with the implementation of friendshoring policies. Those risks include: &quot;first, over-concentration of critical goods in any particular market may result in vulnerability in supply chains that hurt workers and customers; second, the need to protect from geopolitical and security risks emanating from hostile states; and third, the need to shift away from supply chains that relied on violations of core human rights, such as the use of forced labor in producing goods for import.&quot;

====Comments on &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; overturning====
On May 10, 2022, during a Senate Banking Committee hearing, Yellen made comments on the economic consequences of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; overturning after a leaked draft majority opinion in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; showed the Supreme Court was poised to overrule its previous decisions that legalized abortion in the United States. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) asked what reversing the landmark ruling would mean economically for the United States; Yellen responded, &quot;I believe that eliminating the right of women to make decisions about when and whether to have children would have very damaging effects on the economy and would set women back decades.&quot; She added that keeping women from accessing abortions &quot;increases their odds of living in poverty or need for public assistance.&quot; Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC) disagreed with her assertion and said, &quot;I think finding a way to have a debate around abortion in a meeting for the economic stability of our country is harsh.&quot; She replied, &quot;This is not harsh. This is the truth.&quot;

Following that heated exchange, Senator Scott penned an op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in which he called Yellen&#x27;s claim &quot;simply false&quot; and compared her arguments to those of Margaret Sanger in support of eugenics. A number of prominent conservative media outlets and public figures alike similarly interpreted her comments on women&#x27;s reproductive rights, responding with sharp criticism.

==== Internal Revenue Service reforms ====
After the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August 2022, Yellen directed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to use $80 billion in additional funding over a decade to clear backlogs, improve taxpayer services, update technology, and hire thousands of new employees.

In June 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which was passed to reach a bipartisan agreement on debt ceiling, reallocated more than a quarter of the funding previously approved for IRS modernization to other budgetary areas. Despite that, Yellen assured that the agency still possesses the resources it needs in the near term to enhance service and ramp up enforcement. Furthermore, she said that the Treasury Department would continue to advocate for additional funds to make service improvements and help ensure that high-end taxpayers don&#x27;t avoid paying their fair share.

====Visit to Ukraine====
On February 27, 2023, Yellen made a surprise visit to Kyiv, in which she reaffirmed ongoing U.S. economic support for Ukraine in its struggle against Russia&#x27;s invasion, including nearly $50 billion in security, financial, and humanitarian aid the federal government has provided over the past year as Ukraine&#x27;s largest bilateral donor. She met with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy and the country&#x27;s prime minister, Denys Shmyhal, to discuss the rollout of about $1.25 billion in budget relief, the first of a $10 billion package of civilian assistance for things like schools, hospitals, and emergency services, among others.

Coinciding with her visit, Yellen wrote an op-ed for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in which she highlighted the importance of America&#x27;s support and repeated President Biden&#x27;s message that Washington will stand with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes. She said, &quot;We cannot allow Ukraine to lose the war for economic reasons when it has shown an ability to succeed on the battlefield.&quot;

====Banking crisis====
On March 12, 2023, amidst the banking crisis, Yellen made an appearance on CBS&#x27; &quot;Face the Nation&quot; and affirmed that financial regulators closely monitored the state of the banking system to make sure it remained safe and well-capitalized. Addressing the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which marked the second-largest bank failure in American history at the time, she said she had been working with bank regulators to &quot;design appropriate policies&quot; to tackle the issue, though declining to provide further details. She stressed that the possibility of a bailout was off the table. Despite her statement, on the same day, Yellen approved actions enabling the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to complete its resolution of Silicon Valley Bank in a manner that fully protects all depositors by announcing a systemic risk exception, with similar provisions being made for Signature Bank, another failed lender. These extraordinary measures were taken to ensure confidence in the U.S. banking system and prevent spreading of a bank run.

On March 21, Yellen delivered a speech to an American Bankers Association (ABA) summit in which she defended the forceful actions taken by regulators to avert a sweeping banking crisis and pledged resolute Biden administration support for lenders in need, regardless of their respective sizes. She said, &quot;Our intervention was necessary to protect the broader U.S. banking system,&quot; and it was &quot;not focused on aiding specific banks or classes of banks.&quot; Yellen went on to assure that &quot;similar actions could be warranted if smaller institutions suffer deposit runs that pose the risk of contagion.&quot;

Nevertheless, Yellen stated in her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government the following day that the FDIC was not considering providing &quot;blanket insurance or guarantees of deposits.&quot; She said uninsured bank deposits beyond the law-established $250,000 limit could be protected only if a failed bank was deemed to pose a systemic risk to the financial system, and that determination would occur only on a case-by-case basis by the regulators.

On April 21, Yellen announced a proposal by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) for a new procedure to designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important financial institutions, subjecting them to Federal Reserve supervision. It marked an effective reversal of previous guidance, which was issued in 2019 under the Trump administration and, according to Yellen, &quot;created inappropriate hurdles as part of the designation process.&quot; She said such a designation process &quot;could take six years to complete, which could prevent the council from acting to address an emerging risk to financial stability before it&#x27;s too late.&quot; The revised guidance relied on a quantitative and qualitative analysis under which the council determined whether &quot;material financial distress at the company or the company&#x27;s activities could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability&quot; and allowed for ample engagement between regulators and the company under review.

On May 18, the Bank Policy Institute (BPI) convened a meeting of more than two dozen bank CEOs to discuss the current state of the economy. Citing sources familiar with the matter, CNN Business reported on Yellen&#x27;s remarks that more bank mergers may be necessary to overcome the sector&#x27;s crisis.

====Economic approach to China====
In a speech delivered at Johns Hopkins University&#x27;s School of Advanced International Studies on April 20, 2023, Yellen laid out three principal objectives of the Biden administration&#x27;s economic approach toward China. Those principles are: first, the paramount importance of securing American national security interests as well as protecting human rights; second, seeking healthy and fair economic competition with China based on international rules; and third, aiming to engage on major global challenges like easing the debt burden of the developing world and climate change. Though she emphasized that national security would always take priority if it collided with economics, her address ought to be interpreted as an olive branch to Beijing instead of the confrontation that has for a long time prevailed in relations between the two nations. Yellen&#x27;s speech attempted to revive dialogue, at least on economic matters, as she made clear her desire to visit China as soon as possible to get the countries&#x27; previously pragmatic approach to each other back on track. However, its ultimate success is not at all obvious.

Between July 6–9, Yellen visited China, the first trip to the country by a U.S. Treasury secretary in four years and her first since taking office. She began her visit by holding informal talks with the country&#x27;s former vice premier Liu He, and People’s Bank of China (PBC) governor Yi Gang about the state of their domestic economies, as well as the global outlook, in a bid to reopen communication lines and find areas of common economic ground between the two nations. Yellen then met with China&#x27;s newly appointed economic team, including Premier Li Qiang, Vice Premier He Lifeng, finance minister Liu Kun, and Chinese Communist Party (CCP) central bank chief Pan Gongsheng. During those bilateral meetings, she reaffirmed that the US national security restrictions on Chinese investment were intended to be narrowly focused and not have broad effects on the country&#x27;s economy. Yellen also expressed concerns about Chinese economic policies and went on to criticize the country&#x27;s authorities for their treatment of foreign, particularly American, companies; she stated, &quot;We seek healthy economic competition that is not winner-take-all but that, with a fair set of rules, can benefit both countries over time.&quot;

Overall, Yellen&#x27;s visit was part of a broader push by the Biden administration to rebuild bridges between the two countries and open more lines of high-level communication with America&#x27;s main geopolitical rival, in particular with China&#x27;s new economic leaders. In a press conference capping her four-day trip to Beijing, Yellen described it as a mission to revive engagement between the two largest economies and said she believes it has brought US-China ties closer to a &quot;surer footing.&quot;

&quot;We certainly have improved communication,&quot; Yellen said regarding China in an October interview with Sky News. The U.S. established a set of principles to govern Sino-American relations, Yellen said. These principles are: 1. The U.S. will always protect its national security and call out human rights abuses, 2. The U.S. is not seeking to decouple economically from China, and 3. The U.S. and China need to cooperate on a variety of global challenges, including climate change and debt relief.

Comments on Israel

When asked about the potential economic implications of Israel&#x27;s war with Hamas, Yellen told Sky News in an October 2023 interview, &quot;I think it&#x27;s too early to speculate on whether or not there will be significant consequences. I think, importantly, it depends on whether the hostilities extend beyond Israel and Gaza, and that&#x27;s certainly an outcome we would like to avoid.&quot;

Yellen maintained that the U.S. can manage funding wars in both Israel and Ukraine, saying, &quot;America can certainly afford to stand with Israel and to support Israel&#x27;s military needs and we also can and must support Ukraine in its struggle against Russia.&quot; She warned Iran that nothing is &quot;off the table&quot; for sanctions if Tehran is linked to the Hamas-led attack on Israel.

== Economic philosophy ==
Yellen is widely considered to be a &quot;dove&quot; on monetary policy (i.e., more concerned with unemployment than with inflation) and, as such, generally favors lower rather than higher Federal Reserve interest rates. She was overall in favor of more stringent financial regulation to lessen systemic risks brought on by flaws in the financial system. Yellen was arguably the most liberal Federal Reserve leader since Marriner S. Eccles, who was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt amidst the Great Depression in 1934. On fiscal policy, publications frequently refer to her as &quot;sort of&quot; a deficit hawk. She expressed concern about the United States fiscal path prior to the COVID-19 recession, particularly about the national debt; in 2018, she said, &quot;If I had a magic wand, I would raise taxes and cut retirement spending.&quot; The following year, she again suggested that she favored both raising revenue and making changes to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security programs to control spending. In September 2021, at a House Financial Services Committee hearing, Yellen lent support to efforts for the complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the borrowing cap is &quot;very destructive&quot; and poses an unnecessary threat to the American economy.

In January 2019, Yellen was among the 45 original signers of the Economists&#x27; Statement on Carbon Dividends, which was eventually signed by over 3,500 prominent American economists promoting a carbon dividends framework for the U.S. policy on climate change. In October 2020, the Group of Thirty&#x27;s Steering Committee Working Group on Climate Change and Finance, which Yellen co-chaired with Mark Carney, prepared a report that developed a robust and inclusive strategy to amplify and mainstream the global transition to a net-zero emissions economy. The study calls upon governments, businesses, and financial institutions to assess climate risks and supports a phase-in of carbon pricing to accelerate a shift to carbon neutrality.

Yellen is a Keynesian economist and has been described as a &quot;Keynesian to her fingertips&quot;. In April 1999, Yellen discussed her views on the application of Keynesian economics to policymaking at the Yale economics department reunion. She stated that while most economists &quot;appreciate the value of markets and incentives,&quot; Yalies &quot;can recognize when they are not operating correctly and have higher concern for policies to remedy them.&quot; During the 2007–2008 financial crisis, she &quot;warned against an over-hasty removal of stimulus,&quot; and &quot;believes the state has a duty to tackle poverty and inequality.&quot; When her appointment as treasury secretary was announced, Yellen was viewed by Wall Street as a &quot;Treasury secretary who will push hard for expansionary policies aimed at boosting growth, profits and share prices,&quot; although the ability of Yellen to push through her preferred fiscal policies was seen as likely to be constrained by congressional gridlock.

== Honors and awards ==
Yellen has received numerous honors in recognition of her career in academia and politics. These include:

=== Academic ===



=== Memberships and fellowships ===

=== Awards ===

=== Other recognition ===
* In March 2018, Charles D. Ellis endowed &quot;The Janet L. Yellen Chair&quot; at the Yale School of Management, which was named after her. Professor Andrew Metrick has been invested as the inaugural &quot;Janet L. Yellen Professor of Finance and Management&quot; at the School.
* In December 2018, &quot;Federal Reserve Board&quot; presented an annual &quot;Janet L. Yellen Award for Excellence in Community Development&quot; to recognize the exemplary work of Federal Reserve System staff, intended to honor former chair Yellen&#x27;s commitment to public service. Ariel Cisneros of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City has been named the first recipient of the newly created award.
* Yellen has been named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine four times. This occurred in the years 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2023. Additionally, she was named a runner-up for &quot;Time&quot; Person of the Year in 2022.
* Yellen has been ranked on multiple occasions in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s 100 most powerful women. She was named the second-most powerful woman in the world in 2014. &quot;Forbes&quot; also ranked her several times on its list of the world&#x27;s most powerful people. She was named the sixth-most powerful person in the world in 2014 and 2016.

== Personal life ==
Yellen is married to George Akerlof, an economist who is a university professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University and Koshland Professor of Economics Emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, as well as a 2001 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences laureate. The couple met in the fall of 1977, became engaged by that December, and married in June 1978, less than a year after meeting. Their son, Robert Akerlof (born 1981), is a fellow economist. He received a bachelor&#x27;s &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in economics and mathematics from Yale University and earned his PhD in economics from Harvard University, where he was a Presidential Scholar. Robert is an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick.

Yellen and George Akerlof have often collaborated on research, including topics such as poverty, unemployment and a paper on the costs of out-of-wedlock childbearing. One of their most discussed papers at Berkeley, on why lower wages sometimes lead to lower employment, came from the personal experience of hiring a nanny for the first time. Yellen says Akerlof has been her biggest intellectual influence. Both frequently state that their lone disagreement is that she is a bit more supportive of free trade than he is.

Yellen has an estimated net worth of $20million, accrued from stock holdings, speaking engagements, and various government and academic positions. Upon taking office as U.S. Treasury Secretary, she divested her shares including those in Pfizer, ConocoPhillips, and AT&amp;T, among others.

Yellen inherited from her mother a collection of postage stamps worth between $15,000 and $50,000. She doesn&#x27;t collect them on her own.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Who&#x27;s Yellen Now?&quot; is a song by Dessa, a member of the indie hip-hop collective Doomtree and contributor to &quot;The Hamilton Mixtape&quot;. &quot;Marketplace&quot; commissioned the song after then-President-elect Biden announced his intention to nominate Yellen as the nation&#x27;s first female Treasury Secretary and joked that Lin-Manuel Miranda should write a Hamiltonesque musical about her. In addition, &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot; premiered a parody of Hamilton&#x27;s opening song about Yellen.

On NBC&#x27;s sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (SNL), Yellen was parodied by SNL cast member Kate McKinnon in 2021.

<text>The Kongo people (, , singular: ; also , singular: or &quot;M&#x27;kongo&quot;) are a Bantu ethnic group primarily defined as the speakers of Kikongo. Subgroups include the Beembe, Bwende, Vili, Sundi, Yombe, Dondo, Lari, and others.

They have lived along the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, in a region that by the 15th century was a centralized and well-organized Kingdom of Kongo, but is now a part of three countries. Their highest concentrations are found south of in the Republic of the Congo, southwest of Pool Malebo and west of the Kwango River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, north of Luanda, Angola and southwest Gabon. They are the largest ethnic group in the Republic of the Congo, and one of the major ethnic groups in the other two countries they are found in. In 1975, the Kongo population was reported as 4,040,000.

The Kongo people were among the earliest indigenous Africans to welcome Portuguese traders in 1483 CE, and began converting to Catholicism in the late 15th century. They were among the first to protest slave capture in letters to the King of Portugal in the 1510s and 1520s, then succumbed to the demands for slaves from the Portuguese through the 16th century. The Kongo people were a part of the major slave raiding, capture and export trade of African slaves to the European colonial interests in 17th and 18th centuries. The slave raids, colonial wars and the 19th-century Scramble for Africa split the Kongo people into Portuguese, Belgian and French parts. In the early 20th century, they became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, helping liberate the three nations to self-governance.

==Name==
The origin of the name Kongo is unclear, and several theories have been proposed. According to the colonial era scholar Samuel Nelson, the term &quot;Kongo&quot; is possibly derived from a local verb for gathering or assembly. According to Alisa LaGamma, the root may be from the regional word &quot;Nkongo&quot; which means &quot;hunter&quot; in the context of someone adventurous and heroic. 

It may be derived from the proto-bantu word for hunter, similar to the IsiZulu term khonto, which means spear as in &quot;umkhonto we sizwe&quot;, Spear of the Nation, the name for the military wing of the African National Congress (ANC) during its struggle against apartheid.

Douglas Harper states that the term means &quot;mountains&quot; in a Bantu language, which the Congo river flows down from.

The Kongo people have been referred to by various names in the colonial French, Belgian and Portuguese literature, names such as &quot;Esikongo&quot; (singular &quot;Mwisikongo&quot;), &quot;Mucicongo&quot;, &quot;Mesikongo&quot;, &quot;Madcongo&quot; and &quot;Moxicongo&quot;. Christian missionaries, particularly in the Caribbean, originally applied the term &quot;Bafiote&quot; (singular &quot;M(a)fiote&quot;) to the slaves from the Vili or Fiote coastal Kongo people, but later this term was used to refer to any &quot;black man&quot; in Cuba, St Lucia and other colonial era Islands ruled by one of the European colonial interests. The group is identified largely by speaking a cluster of mutually intelligible dialects rather than by large continuities in their history or even in culture. The term &quot;Congo&quot; was more widely deployed to identify Kikongo-speaking people enslaved in the Americas.

Since the early 20th century, &quot;Bakongo&quot; (singular &quot;Mkongo&quot; or &quot;Mukongo&quot;) has been increasingly used, especially in areas north of the Congo River, to refer to the Kikongo-speaking community, or more broadly to speakers of the closely related Kongo languages. This convention is based on the Bantu languages, to which Kongo language belongs. The prefix &quot;mu-&quot; and &quot;ba-&quot; refer to &quot;people&quot;, singular and plural respectively.

Ne in Kikongo designates a title, it is incorrect to call Kongo people by Ne Kongo or a Kongo person by Ne Kongo.

== History ==

The ancient history of the Kongo people has been difficult to ascertain. The region is close to East Africa, considered to be a key to the prehistoric human migrations. This geographical proximity, states Jan Vansina, suggests that the Congo River region, home of the Kongo people, was populated thousands of years ago. Ancient archeological evidence linked to Kongo people has not been found, and glottochronology – or the estimation of ethnic group chronologies based on language evolution – has been applied to the Kongo. Based on this, it is likely the Kongo language and Gabon-Congo language split about 950 BCE.

The earliest archeological evidence is from Tchissanga (now part of modern Republic of the Congo), a site dated to about 600 BCE. However, the site does not prove which ethnic group was resident at that time. The Kongo people had settled into the area well before the fifth century CE, begun a society that utilized the diverse and rich resources of region and developed farming methods. According to James Denbow, social complexity had probably been achieved by the second century CE.

According to Vansina small kingdoms and Kongo principalities appeared in the current region by the 1200 CE, but documented history of this period of Kongo people if it existed has not survived into the modern era. Detailed and copious description about the Kongo people who lived next to the Atlantic ports of the region, as a sophisticated culture, language and infrastructure, appear in the 15th century, written by the Portuguese explorers. Later anthropological work on the Kongo of the region come from the colonial era writers, particularly the French and Belgians (Loango, Vungu, and the Niari Valley), but this too is limited and does not exhaustively cover all of the Kongo people. The evidence suggests, states Vansina, that the Kongo people were advanced in their culture and socio-political systems with multiple kingdoms well before the arrival of first Portuguese ships in the late 15th century.

===The Kingdom of Kongo===
Kongo oral tradition suggests that the Kingdom of Kongo was founded before the 14th century and the 13th century. The kingdom was modeled not on hereditary succession as was common in Europe, but based on an election by the court nobles from the Kongo people. This required the king to win his legitimacy by a process of recognizing his peers, consensus building as well as regalia and religious ritualism. The kingdom had many trading centers both near rivers and inland, distributed across hundreds of kilometers and Mbanza Kongo – its capital that was about 200 kilometers inland from the Atlantic coast.

The Portuguese arrived on the Central African coast north of the Congo River, several times between 1472 and 1483 searching for a sea route to India, but they failed to find any ports or trading opportunities. In 1483, south of the Congo river they found the Kongo people and the Kingdom of Kongo, which had a centralized government, a currency called &quot;nzimbu&quot;, and markets, ready for trading relations. The Portuguese found well developed transport infrastructure inlands from the Kongo people&#x27;s Atlantic port settlement. They also found exchange of goods easy and the Kongo people open to ideas. The Kongo king at that time, named Nzinga a Nkuwu allegedly willingly accepted Christianity, and at his baptism in 1491 changed his name to João I, a Portuguese name.
Around the 1450s, a prophet, Ne Buela Muanda, predicted the arrival of the Portuguese and the spiritual and physical enslavement of many Bakongo.

The trade between Kongo people and Portuguese people thereafter accelerated through 1500. The kingdom of Kongo appeared to become receptive of the new traders, allowed them to settle an uninhabited nearby island called São Tomé, and sent Bakongo nobles to visit the royal court in Portugal. Other than the king himself, much of the Kongo people&#x27;s nobility welcomed the cultural exchange, the Christian missionaries converted them to the Catholic faith, they assumed Portuguese court manners, and by early 16th-century Kongo became a Portugal-affiliated Christian kingdom.

====Start of slavery====
Initially, the Kongo people exchanged ivory and copper objects they made with luxury goods of Portuguese. But, after 1500, the Portuguese had little demand for ivory and copper, they instead demanded slaves in exchange. The settled Portuguese in São Tomé needed slave labor for their sugarcane plantations, and they first purchased labor. Soon thereafter they began kidnapping people from the Kongo society and after 1514, they provoked military campaigns in nearby African regions to get slave labor. Along with this change in Portuguese-Kongo people relationship, the succession system within Kongo kingdom changed under Portuguese influence, and in 1509, instead of the usual election among the nobles, a hereditary European-style succession led to João I&#x27;s succession by king Afonso I. The slave capture and the export of slaves caused major social disorder among the Kongo people, and the Kongo king Afonso I wrote letters to the king of Portugal protesting this practice. Finally, he succumbed to the demand and accepted an export of those who willingly accepted slavery, and for a fee per slave. The Portuguese procured 2,000 to 3,000 slaves per year for a few years, from 1520, a practice that started the slave export history of the Kongo people. However, this supply was far short of the demand for slaves and the money slave owners were willing to pay.

The Portuguese operators approached the traders at the borders of the Kongo kingdom, such as the Malebo Pool and offered luxury goods in exchange for captured slaves. This created, states Jan Vansina, an incentive for border conflicts and slave caravan routes, from other ethnic groups and different parts of Africa, in which the Kongo people and traders participated. The slave raids and volume of trade in enslaved human beings increased thereafter, and by the 1560s, over 7,000 slaves per year were being captured and exported by Portuguese traders to the Americas. The Kongo people and the neighboring ethnic groups retaliated, with violence and attacks, such as the Jaga invasion of 1568 which swept across the Kongo lands, burnt the Portuguese churches, and attacked its capital, nearly ending the Kingdom of Kongo. The Kongo people also created songs to warn themselves of the arrival of the Portuguese, one of the famous songs is &quot; Malele &quot; (Translation: &quot;Tragedy&quot;, song present among the 17 Kongo songs sung by the Massembo family of Guadeloupe during the Grap a Kongo ). The Portuguese brought in military and arms to support the Kingdom of Kongo, and after years of fighting, they jointly defeated the attack. This war unexpectedly led to a flood of captives who had challenged the Kongo nobility and traders, and the coastal ports were flooded with &quot;war captives turned slaves&quot;. The other effect of this violence over many years was making the Kongo king heavily dependent on the Portuguese protection, along with the dehumanization of the African people, including the rebelling Kongo people, as cannibalistic pagan barbarians from &quot;Jaga kingdom&quot;. This caricature of the African people and their dehumanization was vociferous and well published by the slave traders, the missionaries and the colonial era Portuguese historians, which helped morally justify mass trading of slaves.
Modern scholars such as Estevam Thompson have shown that there is much confusion between the &quot;original&quot; Jagas, who left the land of Yaka on the eastern bank of the Kwango River and invaded Mbata and mbanza Kongo, and other later references to &quot;Jaga warriors&quot; roaming the interior of West Central Africa who were, indeed, different Mbangala groups. There are other scholars, such as Joseph Miller, that believed this 16th and 17th centuries&#x27; one-sided dehumanization of the African people was a fabrication and myth created by the missionaries and slave trading Portuguese to hide their abusive activities and intentions.

From the 1570s, the European traders arrived in large numbers and the slave trading through the Kongo people territory dramatically increased. The weakened Kingdom of Kongo continued to face internal revolts and violence that resulted from the raids and capture of slaves, and the Portuguese in 1575 established the port city of Luanda (now in Angola) in cooperation with a Kongo noble family to facilitate their military presence, African operations and the slave trade thereof. The Kingdom of Kongo and its people ended their cooperation in the 1660s. In 1665, the Portuguese army invaded the Kingdom, killed the Kongo king, disbanded his army, and installed a friendly replacement in his place.

=== Smaller kingdoms ===
The 1665 Kongo-Portuguese war and the killing of the hereditary king by the Portuguese soldiers led to a political vacuum. The Kongo kingdom disintegrated into smaller kingdoms, each controlled by nobles considered friendly by the Portuguese. One of these kingdoms was the kingdom of Loango. Loango was in the northern part, above the Congo River, a region which long before the war was already an established community of the Kongo people. New kingdoms came into existence in this period, from the disintegrated parts in the southeast and the northeast of the old Kongo kingdom. The old capital of the Kongo people called São Salvador was burnt down, and was in ruins and abandoned in 1678. The fragmented new kingdoms of the Kongo people disputed each other&#x27;s boundaries and rights, as well as those of other non-Kongo ethnic groups bordering them, leading to steady wars and mutual raids.

The wars between the small kingdoms created a steady supply of captives that fed the Portuguese demand for slaves and the small kingdoms&#x27; need for government income to finance the wars. In the 1700s, a baptized teenage Kongo woman named Dona Beatriz Kimpa Vita claimed to be possessed by Saint Anthony of Padua and that she had been visiting heaven to speak with God. She started preaching that Mary and Jesus were not born in Nazareth but in Africa among the Kongo people. She created a movement among the Kongo people which historians call as Kongo Antonianism.

Dona Beatriz questioned the wars devastating the Kongo people, asked all Kongo people to end the wars that fed the trading in humans, and unite under one king. She attracted a following of thousands of Kongo people into the ruins of their old capital. She was declared a false saint by the Portuguese-appointed Kongo king Pedro IV, with the support of Portuguese Catholic missionaries and Italian Capuchin monks then resident in Kongo lands. The 22 year old Dona Beatriz was arrested, then burnt alive at the stake on charges of being a witch and a heretic.

===Colonial era===
After the death of Dona Beatriz in 1706 and another three years of wars with the help of the Portuguese, Pedro IV was able to get back much of the old Kongo kingdom. The conflicts continued through the 18th century, however, and the demand for and the caravan of Kongo and non-Kongo people as captured slaves kept rising, headed to the Atlantic ports. Although, in Portuguese documents, all of Kongo people were technically under one ruler, they were no longer governed that way by the mid-18th century. The Kongo people were now divided into regions, each headed by a noble family. Christianity was growing again with new chapels built, services regularly held, missions of different Christian sects expanding, and church rituals a part of the royal succession. There were succession crises, ensuing conflicts when a local royal Kongo ruler died and occasional coups such as that of Andre II by Henrique III, typically settled with Portuguese intervention, and these continued through the mid 19th-century. After Henrique III died in 1857, competitive claims to the throne were raised by his relatives. One of them, Pedro Elelo, gained the trust of Portuguese military against Alvero XIII, by agreeing to be vassal of the colonial Portugal. This effectively ended whatever sovereignty had previously been recognized and the Kongo people became a part of colonial Portugal.

In concert with the growing import of Christian missionaries and luxury goods, the slave capture and exports through the Kongo lands grew. With over 5.6 million human beings kidnapped in Central Africa, then sold and shipped as slaves through the lands of the Kongo people, they witnessed the largest exports of slaves from Africa into the Americas by 1867. According to Jan Vansina, the &quot;whole of Angola&#x27;s economy and its institutions of governance were based on the slave trade&quot; in 18th and 19th century, until the slave trade was forcibly brought to an end in the 1840s. This ban on lucrative trade of slaves through the lands of Kongo people was bitterly opposed by both the Portuguese and Luso-Africans (part Portuguese, part African), states Vansina. The slave trade was replaced with ivory trade in the 1850s, where the old caravan owners and routes replaced hunting human beings with hunting elephants for their tusks with the help of non-Kongo ethnic groups such as the Chokwe people, which were then exported with the labor of Kongo people.

Swedish missionaries entered the area in the 1880s and 1890, converting the northeast section of Kongo to Protestantism in the early twentieth century. The Swedish missionaries, notably Karl Laman, encouraged the local people to write their history and customs in notebooks, which then became the source for Laman&#x27;s famous and widely cited ethnography and their dialect became well established thanks to Laman&#x27;s dictionary of Kikongo.

The fragmented Kongo people in the 19th century were annexed by three European colonial empires, during the Scramble for Africa and Berlin Conference, the northernmost parts went to France (now the Republic of Congo and Gabon), the middle part along river Congo along with the large inland region of Africa went to Belgium (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) and the southern parts (now Angola) remained with Portugal. The Kongo people in all three colonies (Angola, the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo) became one of the most active ethnic groups in the efforts to decolonize Africa, and worked with other ethnic groups in Central Africa to help liberate the three nations to self governance. The French and Belgium regions became independent in 1960. Angolan independence came in 1975.

== Language and demographics ==
The language of the Kongo people is called Kikongo (Guthrie: Bantu Zone H.10). It is a macrolanguage and consists of Beembe, Doondo, Koongo, Laari, Kongo-San-Salvador, Kunyi, Vili and Yombe sub-languages. 

The Kongo language is divided into many dialects which are sufficiently diverse that people from distant dialects, such as speakers of Kivili dialect (on the northern coast) and speakers of Kisansolo (the central dialect) would have trouble understanding each other.

In Angola, there are a few who did not learn to speak Kikongo because Portuguese rules of assimilation during the colonial period was directed against learning native languages, though most Bakongo held on to the language. Most Angolan Kongo also speak Portuguese and those near the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo also speak French. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo most also speak French and others speak either Lingala, a common lingua franca in Western Congo, or Kikongo ya Leta (generally known as Kituba particularly in the Republic of the Congo), a creole form of Kikongo spoken widely in the Republic of the Congo and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

== Creation and cosmology ==

The Bakongo believe that in the beginning, the world was circular void, called &quot;mbûngi&quot;, with no life. Then Nzambi Mpungu, the creator god, summoned a great force of fire, called &quot;Kalûnga&quot;, which filled this empty circle. Then Kalûnga heated up the contents of mbûngi, and when it cooled, it formed the earth. The Earth, the starting point of the fire, then became a green planet after it went through four stages. The first stage is the emergence of the fire. The second stage is the red stage where the planet is still burning and has not formed. The third stage is the grey stage where the planet is cooling, but has not produced life. These planets are naked, dry, and covered with dust. The final stage is green stage is when the planet is fully mature because it breathes and carries life. As the Bakongo believe is part of the universal order, all planets must go through this process.

According to Molefi Kete Asante, &quot;Another important characteristic of Bakongo cosmology is the sun and its movements. The rising, peaking, setting, and absence of the sun provide the essential pattern for Bakongo religious culture. These “four moments of the sun” equate with the four stages of life: conception, birth, maturity, and death. For the Bakongo, everything transitions through these stages: planets, plants, animals, people, societies, and even ideas. This vital cycle is depicted by a circle with a cross inside. In this cosmogram or dikenga, the meeting point of the two lines of the cross is the most powerful point and where the person stands.&quot;

The creation of a Bakongo person, or &quot;muntu&quot;, is also believed to follow the four moments of the sun, which play a significant role in their development. &quot;Musoni&quot; is the time when a muntu is conceived both in the spiritual realm and in the womb of a Bakongo woman. &quot;Kala&quot; is the time when a muntu is born into the physical world. This time is also seen as the rise of the sun. &quot;Tukula&quot; is the time of maturity, where a muntu learns to master all aspects of life from spirituality to purpose to personality. The last period of time is &quot;luvemba&quot;, when a muntu physically dies and enters the spiritual world, or &quot;Nu Mpémba&quot;, with of the ancestors, or &quot;bakulu&quot;. Because Bakongo people have a &quot;dual soul-mind,&quot; or &quot;mwèla-ngindu&quot;, they are able to exist and live in both realms during the different moments of their lives. Even while in Nu Mpémba, a muntu still lives a full life as they prepare for Kala time once again. The right side of the body is also believed to be male, while the left side is believed to be female, creating an additional layer to the dual identity of a muntu. For the Bakongo, a person is a &quot;kala-zimikala&quot;, which means a &quot;living-dying-living being.&quot;

A simbi (pl. bisimbi) is a water spirit that is believed to inhabit bodies of water and rocks, having the ability to guide the &quot;bakulu&quot;, or the ancestors, along the Kalûnga River to the spiritual world after they pass away. They are also present during the baptisms of African American Christians, according to Hoodoo tradition.

== Religion ==

The religious history of the Kongo is complex, particularly after the ruling class of the Kingdom of Kongo accepted Christianity at the start of the 16th century. According to historian John K. Thornton, &quot;Central Africans have probably never agreed among themselves as to what their cosmology is in detail, a product of what I called the process of continuous revelation and precarious priesthood.&quot; The Kongo people had diverse views, with traditional religious ideas best developed in the small northern Kikongo-speaking area, and this region neither converted to Christianity nor participated in slave trade until the 19th century. There is abundant description about Kongo religious concepts in the Catholic missionary and colonial era records, but states Thornton, these are written with a hostile bias and their reliability is problematic.

The Kongo people believed in the Creator God &quot;Nzambi Mpungu&quot;, his female counterpart &quot;Nzambici&quot;, and a host of nature spirits that were referred to as &quot;simbi&quot;, &quot;nkisi&quot;, &quot;nkita&quot; and &quot;kilundu&quot; spirits. In an attempt to convince Kongo people to convert to Catholicism, Portuguese missionaries often stressed that Nzambi was the Christian God. Similarly, the early missionaries used Kongo language words to integrate Christian ideas, such as using the words &quot;nkisi&quot; to mean &quot;holy&quot;. Thus, church to Kongo people was &quot;nzo a nkisi&quot;, which means &quot;another shrine,&quot; and the Bible was &quot;mukanda nkisi&quot;, which means &quot;a consecrated charm.&quot; Kongo people maintained both churches and shrines, which they called &quot;Kiteki&quot;. Their smaller shrines were dedicated to the smaller deities, even after they had converted to Christianity. These deities were guardians of water bodies, crop lands and high places to the Kongo people, and they were very prevalent both in capital towns of the Christian ruling classes, as well as in the villages.
The later Portuguese missionaries and Capuchin monks upon their arrival in Kongo were baffled by these practices in the late 17th century (nearly 150 years after the acceptance of Christianity as the state religion in the Kingdom of Kongo). Some threatened to burn or destroy the shrines. However, the Kongo people credited these shrines for abundance and defended them. The Kongo people&#x27;s conversion was based on different assumptions and premises about what Christianity was, and syncretic ideas continued for centuries.

The Kongo people, state the colonial era accounts, included a reverence for their ancestors and spirits. Some BaKongo people shaved their heads to keep it smooth “for spirits that might want to land there.” 

However, some anthropologists report regional differences. According to Dunja Hersak, for example, the Vili and Yombe do not believe in the power of ancestors in the same degree as to those living farther south. Furthermore, she and John Janzen state that religious ideas and emphasis have changed over time.

The slaves brought over by the European ships into the Americas carried with them their traditional ideas. Vanhee suggests that the Afro-Brazilian Quimbanda religion is a new world manifestation of Bantu religion and spirituality, and Kongo Christianity played a role in the formation of Voudou in Haiti.

== Society and culture ==

The large Bakongo society features a diversity of occupations. Some are farmers who grow staples and cash crops. Among the staples are cassava, bananas, maize, taro and sweet potatoes. Other crops include peanuts (groundnuts) and beans. The cash crops were introduced by the colonial rulers, and these include coffee and cacao for the chocolate industry. Palm oil is another export commodity, while the traditional urena is a famine food. Some Kongo people fish and hunt, but most work in factories and trade in towns.

The Kongo people have traditionally recognized their descent from their mother (matrilineality), and this lineage links them into kinship groups. They are culturally organized as ones who cherish their independence, so much so that neighboring Kongo people&#x27;s villages avoid being dependent on each other. There is a strong undercurrent of messianic tradition among the Bakongo, which has led to several politico-religious movements in the 20th century. This may be linked to the premises of dualistic cosmology in Bakongo tradition, where two worlds exist, one visible and lived, another invisible and full of powerful spirits. The belief that there is an interaction and reciprocal exchange between these, to Bakongo, means the world of spirits can possess the world of flesh.


The Kongo week was a four-day week: Konzo, Nkenge, Nsona and Nkandu. These days are named after the four towns near which traditionally a farmer&#x27;s market was held in rotation. This idea spread across the Kongo people, and every major district or population center had four rotating markets locations, each center named after these days of the week. Larger market gatherings were rotated once every eight days, on Nsona Kungu.

== Genetics ==
The Haplogroup L2a is a mtdna clade that was found to be common in the Democratic Republic of Congo amongst Bantu groups, including the Bakongo. Haplogroup E1b1a8 was the most commonly observed y-chromosome clade.

==Nationalism==
The idea of a Bakongo unity, actually developed in the early twentieth century, primarily through the publication of newspapers in various dialects of the language. In 1910 Kavuna Kafwandani (Kavuna Simon) published an article in the Swedish mission society&#x27;s Kikongo language newspaper &quot;Misanü Miayenge&quot; (Words of Peace) calling for all speakers of the Kikongo language to recognize their identity.

The Bakongo people have championed ethnic rivalry and nationalism through sports such as football. The game is organized around ethnic teams, and fans cheer their teams along ethnic lines, such as during matches between the Poto-Poto people and the Kongo people. Further, during international competitions, they join across ethnic lines, states Phyllis Martin, to &quot;assert their independence against church and state&quot;.

<text>Mike Mitchell Goliat (November 5, 1921 – January 13, 2004) was an American professional baseball second baseman, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies (1949–51) and St. Louis Browns (1951–52). He batted and threw right-handed, and was listed at tall and .

A native of Yatesboro, Pennsylvania, Goliat was the starting second baseman for the Phillies &quot;Whiz Kids&quot; team which won the 1950 National League (NL) pennant. In that season, he batted .234, with 13 home runs, 64 runs batted in (RBI), 49 runs scored, 113 hits, 13 doubles, and six triples, in 145 games played; it was Goliat‘s only season as a regular starting player. In the World Series loss to the New York Yankees, he hit .214, with three hits, one run scored, and one RBI, in 14 at bats (AB).

Goliat finished his four-season big league baseball career with a batting average of .225, 186 hits (in 825 AB), 21 doubles, 10 triples, 20 home runs, and 99 RBI, with three stolen bases, in 249 games played.

Goliat played in Minor League Baseball (MiLB) for the Toronto Maple Leafs (1949; 1952–59), and was named the International League (IL) Most Valuable Player (MVP), in 1956. He holds the Maple Leafs’ franchise career records for games played (1,077), home runs (138), doubles (186), and RBI (556).

==Post-baseball life==
After retiring from the pro baseball following the 1961 season, Goliat ran a small trucking firm for several years before joining the Ford Motor Company.

Goliat died on January 13, 2004, in Seven Hills, Ohio, at 82 years of age.

==Quotations==
*&quot;He was really a third baseman, but he played second for us to fill a need. He really had a strong arm. He was a battler who gave everything he had and he had a lot of big hits off (Brooklyn Dodgers ace) Don Newcombe the year we won the pennant.&quot; – Hall of Famer / Teammate Robin Roberts.
*&quot;He hit the better pitchers in the league. The ones that got him out were the lesser ones.&quot; – Phillies manager Eddie Sawyer

<text>Sotades (; 3rd century BC) was an Ancient Greek poet.

Sotades was born in Maroneia, either the one in Thrace, or in Crete. He lived in Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus (285–246 BC). The city was at that time a remarkable center of learning, with a great deal of artistic and literary activity, including epic poetry and the Great Library. Only a few genuine fragments of his work have been preserved; those in Stobaeus are generally considered spurious. Ennius translated some poems of this kind, included in his book of satires under the name of Sota. He had a son named Apollonius. He has been credited with the invention of the palindrome.

Sotades was the chief representative of the writers of obscene and even satirical poems, called &quot;kinaidoi&quot; (), composed in the Ionic dialect and in the metre named after him. One of his poems attacked Ptolemy II Philadelphus&#x27;s marriage to his own sister Arsinoe II, from which came the infamous line: &quot;You&#x27;re sticking your prick in an unholy hole.&quot; For this, Sotades was imprisoned, but he escaped to the city of Caunus, where he was afterwards captured by the admiral Patroclus, shut up in a leaden chest, and thrown into the sea. 

British Orientalist and explorer Sir Richard Francis Burton (1821–1890) hypothesised the existence of a &quot;Sotadic zone&quot;. He asserted that there exists a geographic zone in which pederasty is prevalent and celebrated among the indigenous inhabitants, and named it after Sotades.

<text>Lennox and Addington County is a county and census division of the Canadian province of Ontario. The county seat is Greater Napanee. It is located in the subregion of Southern Ontario named Eastern Ontario.

Around the middle of the 19th century, the Addington Road was built by the province to encourage settlement in the northern sections of the county.

==Historical evolution==
The two original counties of Lennox and Addington, respectively named after Charles Lennox, 3rd Duke of Richmond and Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth, were organized for electoral purposes in 1792, and were situated within the Mecklenburg District. Mecklenburg was renamed as the &quot;Midland District&quot; in 1792.

In 1798, the Parliament of Upper Canada passed legislation to provide, that, at the beginning of 1800:

In 1821, the newly surveyed township of Kaladar was added to the counties.

In 1845, the counties regained their separate identities, but still remained united for electoral purposes. The newly surveyed township of Anglesea was added to Addington at that time.

Fredericksburgh Township had been settled in 1784, and officially separated into North Fredericksburgh and South Fredericksburgh in 1857.

At the beginning of 1850, Midland District was abolished, and the United Counties of Frontenac, Lennox and Addington replaced it for municipal and judicial purposes. In 1860, Lennox and Addington were formally amalgamated as the &quot;County of Lennox and Addington&quot;, and declared to be the junior county in the United Counties. The townships of Effingham, Abinger, Ashby and Denbigh were added to the County at the same time.

Upon the dissolution of the United Counties at the beginning of 1865, the County became separate for all purposes.

In the late 1990s, the County&#x27;s municipalities were reorganized to form the town of Greater Napanee and the townships of Addington Highlands, Loyalist, and Stone Mills.

<doc id="627786" wikidata="Q382652" url="?curid=627786" title="Oxford County, Ontario">
<text>Oxford County is a regional municipality in the Canadian province of Ontario. Highway 401 runs east–west through the centre of the county, creating an urban industrial corridor with more than half the county&#x27;s population, spanning 25 km between the Toyota auto assembly plant in Woodstock and the CAMI General Motors auto assembly plant in Ingersoll. The local economy is otherwise dominated by agriculture, especially the dairy industry.

The Oxford County regional seat is in Woodstock. Oxford County has been a regional municipality since 2001 but has retained the word &quot;county&quot; in its name. It has a two-tier municipal government structure, with the lower-tier municipalities being the result of a merger in 1975 of a larger number of separate municipalities that previously existed before the restructuring. It also comprises a single Statistics Canada census division, and a single electoral division for federal and provincial elections for which the precise boundaries have been revised from time to time. For part of its history, it was divided into two ridings, Oxford North, for federal and provincial elections, and Oxford South, for federal and provincial elections, for each of which see their own pages. Oxford County had its own school board until 1998, when it was merged into the Thames Valley District School Board. It had its own Health Unit until 2018, when it was merged into the Southwestern Public Health Unit.

==Local government==
Oxford County consists of eight lower-tier municipalities (in order of 2016 population):
* City of Woodstock (40,902)
* Town of Tillsonburg (15,872)
* Town of Ingersoll (12,757)
* Township of Norwich (11,001)
* Township of Zorra (8,058)
* Township of South-West Oxford (7,544)
* Township of Blandford-Blenheim (7,359)
* Township of East Zorra-Tavistock (6,836)

Local municipal governments in Ontario exercise authority delegated to them by the provincial government, which may choose at any time to increase or decrease the powers given to them through enabling statutes, as was demonstrated in the decision by the Ontario government in 2018 to reduce the size of Toronto&#x27;s council, despite the city&#x27;s opposition. In the early days of Upper Canada, the relevant legislation provided for convening an annual meeting of property owners in each township, who were obligated to choose such officers as a township clerk, a constable, property tax assessors and collectors, fence viewers and pound keepers. It was a matter of pride in each township to keep track of population growth, and several townships were divided as they grew, giving separate town meetings and local officers to East, West and North divisions of Oxford-on-the-Thames, East and West divisions of Nissouri, and East and West divisions of Zorra.

The individuals were responsible for the administrative work necessary to enforce the laws of the province and to carry out decisions made at the district level by the area&#x27;s Justices of the Peace, appointed by the Governor, who met periodically at the designated district courthouse for deliberations known as Quarter Sessions. The paternalistic authority of the Governor and his chosen Justices of the Peace continued as the hierarchy for local government until 1841. From the earliest days of settlement, the District Court was convened in the Long Point Settlement, first at Turkey Point, then at the village of Vittoria. It was moved to London in 1826. The Brock District, containing Oxford County&#x27;s territory, was then split off from the London District in 1840.

By the time a courthouse had been built for the Brock District at Woodstock, legislative changes were introduced by the province to provide for election of district council members from each township to take over the local government role from the Justices of the Peace, but appointment of the warden and senior administrative officers for each district council remained the responsibility of the provincial government.

District councils were abolished and replaced with fully elected county councils by the implementation of the Baldwin Act in 1850. The provincial legislation defined the structure for fully-elected local municipal government in Ontario for the next century. In addition to defining the powers of the county council, the legislation created authority for township councils and provided for creation of village, town, and city councils. Woodstock, Ingersoll, Tillsonburg, and other communities within Oxford County were in time incorporated under those provisions as separate municipalities.

At around the same time as the Baldwin Act came into force, some of the townships that had been included in the Brock District were severed off to become parts of a new Brant County and a reconfigured Middlesex County. Norwich Township was divided into North and South in 1855. In the 1960s, the Ontario government began simplifying the structure of local government in select parts of the province, and the process reached Oxford County in 1975, when the number of separate township and village councils was reduced to the current five townships. Three urban municipalities also remained: Ingersoll, Tillsonburg, and Woodstock. The county boundaries were also enlarged to include the entire urban areas of Tavistock in the north and of Tillsonburg in the south.
==History==

The geographical area that is now Oxford County was populated with Neutral/Attawandaron longhouse villages for many centuries but was abandoned to First Nations nomadic peoples by the 1650s, as a result of warfare with Iroquois and epidemics resulting from European contact. The land was acquired by the Crown by three treaties, signed in 1792 (by chiefs of the Mississaugas First Nation), in 1796 (by chiefs of the Chippewas First Nation) and 1827 (by chiefs of the Chippewas). They depended for their certainty on an earlier treaty known as the McKee Purchase of 1790, signed at Detroit with 35 chiefs from the Potawatomi, Wyandot, Ojibwe, and Odawa First Nations.

Oxford County was created by the legislature of the province of Upper Canada in 1798 by an enactment that came into force at the beginning of 1800. The immediate purpose was for better organization of the local militia and the improvement of the social order by the appointment of a lord lieutenant, part of the aristocratic framework for the new province that had been put in place by Governor Simcoe. The county lieutenant appointed for Oxford was William Claus, a grandson of Sir William Johnson and then head of the Indian Department responsible for oversight of the Six Nations settled along the Grand River tract running north and south on the eastern boundary of Oxford.
As first established, Oxford County consisted of the townships of Blenheim, Burford, Oxford-on-the-Thames, Blandford, Norwich, and Dereham (lands to the north of the Thames River had not yet been purchased by the Crown). The first three had been receiving settlers since the summer of 1793, under the leadership of Thomas Hornor (Blenheim), Benajah Mallory (Burford), and Thomas Ingersoll (Oxford-on-the-Thames), each of whom was also captain of the militia in his respective township. Claus remained resident in Niagara, and his appointment as the Crown&#x27;s head for the county set off a rivalry between Hornor and Mallory for the prestige of appointment as Claus&#x27;s resident deputy lieutenant within the county, eventually won by Hornor. Thomas Ingersoll left the county, but the rivalry between Hornor and Mallory for pre-eminence continued for more than a decade, as Mallory was elected as the county&#x27;s representative in the legislative assembly for Upper Canada in 1804 and again in 1808. All of that was swept away with the coming of the War of 1812. Appointed temporary administrator of the government, General Isaac Brock moved Claus to the head of the Lincoln Militia and appointed Henry Bostwick to head the Oxford Militia, thus passing over Hornor for any role in the war effort (Bostwick was the son of a former associate of Thomas Ingersoll). Mallory lost the 1812 election and turned traitor during the war by defecting to the American side as a captain in a volunteer corps.
By the end of the first quarter-century of its development, Oxford&#x27;s population was nearing 2,000 people, but many problems were holding back its development. Robert Gourlay, a Scotsman whose wife had inherited nearly 1,000 acres in Dereham township (around today&#x27;s Mount Elgin), made the journey to Oxford in 1817 to inspect the prize but could not believe that the township was still a complete wilderness. He began a public movement to find solutions through public gatherings and newspaper advocacy all over Upper Canada but in return was prosecuted and jailed by the government for sedition. Gourlay&#x27;s two-volume &quot;Statistical account of Upper Canada, compiled with a view to a grand system of emigration&quot;, published in London in 1822, presented a detailed analysis based upon reports submitted to him by citizen groups in 57 townships who yearned for improvements. Gourlay spent the next 35 years away from Canada but returned to his land in Oxford in 1856 to run for election.
Gourlay was just one of many voices that created dissatisfaction in Oxford and area over the slow pace of growth that continued in the 1820s and 1830s. American-born settlers were again making their way to the county, such as George Tillson, the founder of Tillsonburg, and Abraham Beach, the founder of Beachville. By 1821 all of Thomas Ingersoll&#x27;s sons had returned to create the village that became Ingersoll. Thomas Hornor was elevated again as the county&#x27;s champion, appointed in 1820 to head the Oxford Militia and served as the county&#x27;s representative in the legislative assembly throughout the next decade. There, he was among the members who sought repeal of the law that had been used to imprison Gourlay and opposed laws aimed at restricting rights of settlers who had come from the United States. The Crown entered into a treaty to purchase the lands north of the Thames River and two more townships were added to the county, Zorra and Nissouri, which was followed by an influx of Scottish and Irish immigrants displaced from their homes, such as the large numbers of Sutherlandshire Highlanders who created a Gaelic-speaking enclave around the village of Embro in Zorra Township. Many of them arrived destitute in Oxford after they had suffered brutal evictions from their homeland, often by mass burnings of homes described by their countryman, Donald McLeod, who lived out his remaining days in Oxford after completing his book &quot;Gloomy Memories&quot;. A new government program that gave preferential grants to encourage retired British military officers to settle in Upper Canada in the 1830s was successful in bringing many to Oxford who showed a determination to make Woodstock the seat of a new local aristocracy, just as Simcoe had envisioned 40 years earlier. The &quot;father of the settlement&quot; at Woodstock was Rear-Admiral Henry Vansittart, surrounded by an assortment of retired army and navy officers who had been schooled in the Napoleonic Wars. 
Resentment of the old settlers grew to rebellion, with Oxford&#x27;s elected member in the legislative assembly, Dr. Charles Duncombe, taking on the role as leader of an uprising in December 1837. In the aftermath, Duncombe was driven into exile, and one of the Woodstock retired Royal Navy veterans, Captain Andrew Drew (Vansittart&#x27;s right-hand man), created an international incident that is still studied by legal scholars, when he led a raid into the United States to seize and burn a paddlewheel steamer being used in the Niagara River by the exiled rebels, leaving it to drift over Niagara Falls.

The decade of political turmoil that followed resulted in greater democratic government at the local and provincial levels, as Oxford repeatedly elected Reformers to serve as the county&#x27;s representative in the legislative assembly. They included a Prime Minister (Sir Francis Hincks) and two Fathers of Confederation (George Brown and Sir Oliver Mowat). Enormous growth in the 1840s to the 1860s also became a cure for past grievances. The population chart tells the story and shows the county eventually reached a population plateau in the 1870s that continued well into the first half of the 20th century.

A new era of urbanization starting in the 1950s added 25,000 people to Woodstock, 10,000 to Tillsonburg, and 6,000 to Ingersoll, which has been most of Oxford County&#x27;s modern growth.

==Demographics==
As a census division in the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Oxford County had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


==Diversity==
The Census Commissioner for Oxford County in 1852, Thomas Shenston, compiled elaborate statistics from census records and published the results in a book that year, the first ever to give a detailed examination of the county.
His analysis of place of birth shows that more than half (17,990) of the county&#x27;s population had been born in the province, and of the remainder, the largest groups were from Scotland (4,685), England (3,724), the United States (2,618), Ireland (2,371), and Germany (322). He reports that there were 123 Negroes, 101 of them in Norwich township, which had a community of escaped slaves settled around the village of Otterville. There were 47 distinct religious denominations in the total population, of which 8,493 were Methodists in 5 different denominations, 8,300 were in Scotch or Presbyterian denominations, 5,760 Anglicans, 4,579 Baptists in 5 different denominations, 2,194 were Roman Catholics, 730 Quakers, and 161 Mennonites, amongst other smaller groups including Israelites, Infidels, Free-Thinkers and Heathens.

==Historic hamlets, postal villages and rural clusters==

Oxford County has a multitude of place names identifying the communities which have grown up as service hubs in the course of the county&#x27;s history. A large proportion of these were granted their own post offices and thus became known as &quot;postal villages&quot;, details of which can be found in the online database maintained by Library and Archives Canada. For purposes of modern land use planning, the county now distinguishes between Large Urban Centres being Woodstock, Tillsonburg and Ingersoll, and Rural settlement areas, categorized as Serviced Villages, Villages or Rural Clusters. There are 21 Villages and nearly 40 Rural Clusters currently identified by the county&#x27;s land use plan. An online database of historic place names and locations of these communities is maintained by the Oxford County Library. Most unusual place name in the county belongs to Punkeydoodles Corners, located at the convergence of the border lines of Oxford County, Perth County and Waterloo County, thus making it part of all three counties. It drew national attention on Canada Day in 1982, when former Prime Minister Joe Clark was present for festivities. To mark the occasion, a post office was opened there for one day to issue commemorative stamps and a monument was erected.

==Archaeology, history and genealogy research==
For the first several generations of European settlement, knowledge of First Nations occupation was limited to souvenir hunters who searched freshly-plowed fields for whatever relics had turned up. The first comprehensive scientific archaeology in Oxford County was carried out by William J. Wintemberg (1876–1941), the &quot;Father of Canadian Archaeology&quot;, who grew up just outside the northern boundary of the county and conducted extensive studies throughout Oxford during his career. Modern-day evaluations of new site discoveries still reference Wintemberg&#x27;s concepts, although researchers sometimes caution against fitting old moulds, particularly when interpreting the 15th century longhouse village site discovered at Tillsonburg twenty years ago which is considered &quot;off the charts&quot; by comparison to other sites which have been found and studied.

Attempts to record the history of Oxford County were few and far between during the first century of European settlement and growth. Thomas S. Shenston (1822–1895), the Oxford County commissioner for the provincial census of 1851, authored &quot;The Oxford gazetteer; containing a complete history of the county of Oxford, from its first settlement...&quot; in 1852, but in footnotes to several portions of the text he indicates that the historical narrative he had compiled was forced out of the book by the amount of census data tabulated in its pages. Despite its shortcomings, the book was reprinted by the county as a Canada Centennial project in 1967. When the mania for illustrated county atlases swept across Ontario in the 1870s, Oxford was included, but the volume published by Walker and Miles of Toronto in 1876 devoted only five pages to a summary of the county&#x27;s history. Oxford was not included in the mania which created county history volumes in the 1880s and 1890s, but the Oxford Historical and Museum Society was established in 1897, and a great leap forward took place in 1948 when it partnered with the Royal Ontario Museum and the University of Western Ontario to create the first of what the Ontario government planned as a network of county museums to aid local schools in teaching students about their history. Since then, the Oxford Historical Society has published a series of booklets as history bulletins and a quarterly newsletter, and also ensures that more recent books by local historians are kept in print and available for purchase.

Although little was written in the 19th century about the county&#x27;s history, directories of businesses and property owners were very popular and most of those which were published between the 1850s and 1890s are now available and searchable online – a boon to genealogists. Oxford County has a very active branch of the Ontario Genealogical Society.

The Oxford Historical Society collections are housed with those of the Genealogical Society in a modern facility opened by the county in 2012 for the Oxford County Archives.

==Economic development==
===Roads, canals, railways, and highways===
The greatest hindrance to developing pioneer Oxford was its landlocked location, remote from the Great Lakes.

Governor Simcoe&#x27;s vision for the area in the 1790s included planning a government road joining Burlington Bay to the site of a new provincial capital at London, through a government town where the road first reached the Thames River in Oxford township (now Woodstock), and also plans for a canal across Blandford and Blenheim township joining the Thames River to the Grand River, thereby creating an inland water transport route through the whole area from Detroit to Brantford (see 1795 and 1800 map views on this page). The canal was never built, and the &#x27;Governor&#x27;s Road&#x27; (today a part of Dundas Street) could not be used for decades because no bridge was built where it was to cross the Grand River (now Paris, which did not begin to develop as a village until the 1820s). The reality was that pioneer land transportation continued to follow the ancient footpath from Burlington Bay to the Thames River using a river crossing at what became known as Brant&#x27;s Ford (Brantford) on the Six Nations lands, then down the banks of the Thames River to Detroit. Thomas Ingersoll bore the expense of making the path passable for wagons between Brant&#x27;s Ford and the Thames River as part of his efforts to develop Oxford township in the mid-1790s. Later government appropriations extended that roadwork all the way down the Thames to Detroit – what was henceforth known as the Detroit Road. Woodstock&#x27;s merchants gained support to improve the road along a detour taking it to the Vansittart landholdings (Eastwood) along the Governor&#x27;s Road east of Woodstock, and it was that route which became Highway 53 through Burford and Brantford to Hamilton. The wisdom of a road link from Burlington Bay (Hamilton) through Brantford into Oxford has been reaffirmed with the completion of Highway 403, which also joins the 401 to the east of Woodstock. The portion which originally led into the centre of Oxford is now a county road named the Old Stage Road. The 401 itself replicates the old Detroit Road.
Transportation within Oxford was greatly improved with toll roads and railways planned in the 1830s which were actually built in the 1840s and later. Ingersoll people collaborated with Tillsonburg and points south to construct the Ingersoll and Port Burwell Plank and Gravel Road starting in 1849, which was later extended as a toll road north through Zorra into Perth County. It endures today as Highway 19. Woodstock collaborated with Norwich and Port Dover to build another north–south toll road in the 1850s which was later extended up into Perth County through Tavistock. It endures today as Highway 59. Railways were built criss-crossing Oxford in the 1850s and 1860s, joining Woodstock and Ingersoll to Detroit and Toronto, as well as joining Woodstock to Stratford and Port Dover and Norwich to Brantford and Port Burwell. An electric street railway joined Woodstock and Ingersoll through Beachville from 1900 to the 1920s, but was replaced by a bus service which succumbed in the 1940s to private automobiles as the preferred mode of travel thereafter. Woodstock has developed a transit system which now operates a fleet of 11 buses six days a week, and charter bus companies have experimented with other local services.

===Dairy industry===
A 2008 summary put Oxford&#x27;s annual milk production at 60 million gallons from the county&#x27;s 344 dairy farms, the highest output of any county in Ontario, considered to be enough to supply 3 million people. Farm cash receipts for dairy farming in Oxford in 2016 were more than $223 million. The first two cows were brought into Oxford-on-the-Thames by Thomas Ingersoll in the 1790s, and by 1810 the township was famous for butter and cheese made by farmers&#x27; wives for local sale. On some farms this grew to a truly industrial scale, with some in the Ingersoll area producing as much as one hundred pounds a day by the 1830s. The queen of cheesemakers was Lydia Ranney on their family farm just south of Ingersoll, who was creating thousand pound cheeses for prize competitions at provincial expositions by the 1840s.

===Wheat, corn and soybeans===
The first crop which had earning potential for Oxford&#x27;s pioneers was wheat. In 1852 it was estimated that the county had produced 611,000 bushels, of which 450,000 bushels were exported. When wheat yields fell as a result of soil exhaustion and insect infestations by the 1860s, greater reliance was placed on dairying for butter and cheesemaking. Corn and soybean production now compete with dairying for available farmland, driving up land prices. Wheat is also resurgent. In 1852, only 2,700 acres were devoted to corn. By 2012, corn was being grown on 158,000 acres, producing 25 million bushels. In the same year, soybeans were grown on 77,000 acres yielding 3.7 million bushels, and wheat was grown on 21,000 acres, yielding 2.1 million bushels. As of 2016, Oxford was growing 7 per cent of the corn produced in Ontario, 4 per cent of the wheat, and 3 per cent of its soybeans, resulting in more than $180 million farm cash receipts.

===Tobacco===
Despite decades of public education and government restrictions on marketing, the worldwide revenue in the tobacco industry is still in the range of $500 billion annually. Ontario&#x27;s tobacco belt – an area with sandy loam and warm temperatures ideal for growing tobacco – stretches across the southern portion of Oxford County and the northern portions of Elgin and Norfolk. The crop gained in popularity in the 1920s and by the 1960s the whole economy of the area was dominated by tobacco growing, accounting for 90 per cent of all tobacco grown in Canada. Aggressive expansion of crop area led to recognition of increased risk the area could turn into a desert, but this was remedied with tree-planting. The seasonal workforce demands drew annual influxes of migrant workers and conditions which were made legend in Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors&#x27; 1970 hit song &quot;Tillsonburg&quot;. To cut back production as part of its anti-smoking campaigns, a buyout program was implemented by the federal government in 2008, with payouts totalling $350 million to farmers who agreed to switch to other crops (the buyout funds came from a $1 billion settlement agreed by the major cigarette manufacturers as a result of prosecution for illegal activities). The result was a drop in annual production from 84 million pounds to 20 million pounds. Farmers who agreed to the buyout have favoured a switch to fruit and vegetable crops.

===Poultry and Other Livestock===
The pioneer scene with a few hens scratching in the yard and a rooster crowing atop a fence rail has long since given way to giant poultry barns. As of 2017, Oxford County is the third highest chicken producer in the province, with 108 farms generating 48 million kilograms of chickens per year (8% of the provincial total). It has 15 turkey farms that raise nearly half a million birds per year (12% of the provincial total). It is the second highest pork producer in Ontario, with 128 farms raising nearly 1 million hogs per year (14% of the provincial total). The county&#x27;s beef farmers raise about 100,000 head per year (6% of the provincial total). Farm cash receipts from these 4 categories of livestock were about $190 million in Oxford in 2016.

===Manufacturing===

====Forest products====

The earliest activities which could be categorised as manufacturing for sale were byproducts of the pioneers&#x27; war on the forests which covered the county. As part of his experiment in granting townships to proprietors such as Thomas Hornor, Benajah Mallory and Thomas Ingersoll in the 1790s, Gov. Simcoe imposed terms which sometimes required construction of saw mills. Thomas Hornor was the first to comply, putting a mill into operation in Blenheim Township by 1795, but his millpond dam collapsed and no immediate attempt was made to rebuild. Efforts in Dorchester Township just to the west of Oxford&#x27;s boundary by William Reynolds and Seth Putnam were more successful, but production from their saw mills remained on a small scale for many years. A visitor in 1804 described the difficulty faced rafting lumber from those mills down the Thames River nearly 300 kilometres to sell at Detroit – three or four men could deliver 25,000 board feet at a time in this way and bring back goods to sell upon return, but it was a ten- to fourteen-day journey. Export sales were more frequent for potash and pearlash derived from burning timber and boiling the ashes; individual settlers had little wheat to spare in their early years, but plenty of wood ashes that could be boiled and bartered with local merchants in exchange for supplies. Export of sawn lumber eventually became a booming market by the 1840s, increased with the improvement of roads by toll companies, and even more so after the construction of railways through Oxford.

====Cheese factories====
Grist and flour mills, furniture factories, carriage and wagon factories, tanneries and shoe factories, foundries producing farm equipment, and knitting mills were all becoming commonplace in the county by the 1850s, but the real revolution in manufacturing activity came in the 1860s, with the arrival of cheese factories. It is accepted that the first cheese factories in Canada were established in Oxford County, although there is still some controversy about which one was the very first. Officially the title is given to Harvey Farrington for a factory in Norwich township opened in 1864, but it is likely his was preceded by the factory operated by Andes Smith in the same township. To display his accomplishments, Smith manufactured a 4,000 pound cheese, believed to have been the biggest ever made, which was exhibited at the New York State Fair in Utica and then the Provincial Exhibition in Toronto in 1865, but the fate of that monster foretold Smith&#x27;s doom. In the course of hauling it from the exhibition grounds to the railway station for shipment to England for exhibition and sale, a wheel came off the wagon and the cheese was overturned and broke apart. Smith went bankrupt the following year, and fame passed to Harvey Farrington who had built a co-op factory at which risk was shared.

The real coup came when a consortium in Ingersoll manufactured the 7,300 pound &quot;Mammoth Cheese&quot; which was successfully displayed in New York state as well as in England. The success of the Ingersoll venture led to the town becoming the home of the newly created Canadian Dairymen&#x27;s Association in 1867, and also the cheese export market seat for a throng of cheese factories which quickly went into operation around the county. Cheese factory production in neighbourhood factories surged for the next half century, and millions of pounds of cheese passed through export warehouses in Ingersoll, then later Woodstock as well, but then began to taper off before the First World War and had greatly fallen off by the 1930s. By then Oxford&#x27;s milk production was being trucked to London and Toronto rather than local cheese factories. The Ingersoll Packing Company, later renamed the Ingersoll Cream Cheese Company, continued a large-scale manufacture for international markets, but by 1956 Maclean&#x27;s lamented to the whole country that Ingersoll cheese might become a thing of the past. It did by the 1970s. After lying vacant for many years, the Ingersoll cheese factory was reopened in 1999 as Local Dairy producing artisanal cheese, cultured butter, and yogurt. Other artisanal factories such as Gunn&#x27;s Hill near Woodstock have also taken off, giving a new meaning to Oxford&#x27;s Cheese Trails tourism promotions. There are currently 5 provincially-licensed factories in Oxford.

====Food processing====

The county&#x27;s economic development efforts aimed at increasing food processing within Oxford suffered a setback in 2018 with the closing of the Cold Springs Farms turkey processing and feed mill plant at Thamesford, with the loss of 425 jobs. Cold Springs was founded by W. Harvey Beatty (1916–1994), a dynamo who worked around crippling injuries to build an enterprise starting in Thamesford in 1949 that eventually included 60 farms in Ontario. For his business accomplishments and commitment to industry organizations, he was inducted into the Canadian Agriculture Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Ontario Agricultural Hall of Fame in 2018.

====Heavy industry====

Vast portions of Oxford County are underlain with limestone deposits which are ideal for manufacture of lime and cement. A deposit of unusual purity 100 feet deep stretches from Norwich up to Embro through the centre of the county, with potential extraction volumes of 3.5 billion tonnes. Over 3,000 acres of the deposit area has been licensed by the Ontario government for limestone quarrying. The village of Beachville is atop the deposit and became well known from its earliest days for small kilns burning limestone to produce lime, but manufacturing on a heavy industrial scale now takes place in mills adjacent to quarry properties covering thousands of acres in the county, operated by Lafarge Canada Inc. (1,400 acres) and Carmeuse Lime (Canada) Limited (1,800 acres). The mills which burn the limestone were built in the 1950s with revolving kilns which were the largest pieces of mobile factory equipment in the world, some measuring 10 feet in diameter by 450 feet long. The rate of extraction estimated in the 1980s was an average of 600,000 tonnes per year. It is an energy-intensive industry with very high carbon outputs. Research involving Lafarge in England aims to develop products that will use rather than release some of the carbon.

Automobile assembly plants in Ingersoll (CAMI/General Motors) and Woodstock (Toyota) and related parts manufacturers, warehouses and trucking companies have been a growing part of Oxford County&#x27;s industrial base since 1985. The Ingersoll assembly plant reached production of its 5 millionth vehicle in May 2018.

==Services==
=== Health ===
Oxford County has full service general hospitals in Woodstock and Tillsonburg. A limited services hospital with acute care facilities is located in Ingersoll. All three hospitals have 24/7 emergency room facilities. Each has associated with it a branch of Woodingford Lodge, a long-term care living network operated by Oxford County on a not-for-profit basis. The Oxford County Community Support Services Network offers a variety of health based Community Support Services to help Seniors and Adults with Disabilities remain in their homes. 1-888-866-7518

===Police, fire and ambulance===

Since Woodstock was first settled in the early 1800s, the city has experienced a rich police history. Early law enforcement in the area was conducted by British military veterans who established a system of law based on their British military background. On 13 May 1865, a by-law was passed to establish a &quot;Town Lock-up&quot;, and William Currie, was appointed Chief Constable for the Town of Woodstock. The first Police office and lock up was located in the basement of the present day Woodstock Museum. The Woodstock Police Department continued to grow and by 1875 consisted of a Chief Constable and two Police Constables. On 1 July 1901, Woodstock was incorporated as a City. This placed policing under the control of a Board of Commissioners. A long succession of Chiefs continued to guide the force as it grew in numbers and expertise with the longest serving being Chief Arthur R. Moore who was appointed Chief Constable in 1920 and served for almost 30 years.

In January 1999, the Oxford Community Police Service was formed amalgamating the former Woodstock Police Department, Tavistock Police Service and Township of Norwich Police Service. In addition to the amalgamation of these police services the Oxford Community Police Service assumed the policing responsibilities for the three rural townships of Blandford Blenheim, East Zorra Tavistock, and Norwich. Chief Joe Opthof, Chief Rod Piukkala and Chief Ron Fraser, all served as Chiefs of the Oxford Community Police Service.

However, a few communities such as Ingersoll, Norwich and Tillsonburg were patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Oxford detachment, with Ingersoll formerly having its own independent police service for many years before merging with the OPP. On 19 October 2009, the Oxford Community Police Service ceased to exist and the Woodstock Police Service was reborn under the direction of Chief Rod Freeman. The rest of Oxford County is patrolled by the Ontario Provincial Police (OPP) Oxford detachment.

In 1999 The Government of Ontario downloaded responsibility for the provision of Land Ambulance Services. In the southern half of the province, the responsibility fell onto Upper Tier Municipalities, such as county or regional governments. Woodstock Ambulance Ltd. and Tillsonburg District Memorial Hospital Ambulance were transferred to the County of Oxford on January 1, 2002, to form Oxford County Paramedic Services. In 2017, Oxford County became the first municipality in Canada to introduce electric hybrid ambulances as part of its Paramedic Services fleet with the purchase of two Crestline Coach Fleetmax XL3 Hybrid ambulances.

== Social issues ==
===Land use and environmental controls===
Residents of Ingersoll and surrounding area have been in a militant state of opposition since the announcement in 2012 that the international conglomerate Carmeuse intends to give a 20-year lease to Walker Industries to operate a megadump taking in garbage from Toronto and London to fill the spent portion of the limestone quarry operated by Carmeuse on its nearly 2,000 acres stretching east and north from Ingersoll&#x27;s eastern boundary. Walker has referenced plans to use the quarry site for a multi-use &#x27;campus&#x27; for garbage and recycling operations. Carmeuse has also announced plans to switch to burning garbage in its kilns, which must be heated to 1,000 degrees to process limestone into industrial lime. As a preliminary, it will conduct a pilot Alternative Low-Carbon Fuels (&quot;ALCF&quot;) project to assess pollution levels that result from burning &#x27;engineered&#x27; garbage to be trucked in from New York state. Long term, ALCF garbage to be burned would include non-recyclable paper and plastic packaging materials, cardboard/paper sludge, non-recyclable rubber and plastic from automotive manufacturing, nylon tire fluff/belting, waste materials from diaper manufacturers, and wood refuse.

Burning garbage in its cement plant kilns is also under study by Lafarge at its branches worldwide. Lafarge and its 1,400 acres north of the Carmeuse lands are not a part of the Walker/Carmeuse garbage landfill/recycling proposal currently in contention, and Oxford County residents are concerned Walker has declined to disclose its future business plans for the quarry sites other than the nearly 200 acre section being made available by Carmeuse along Ingersoll&#x27;s eastern boundary for which Walker seeks megadump approval.

===Farm income, labour shortages and production standards===
Oxford County has approximately 2,000 farms of varying sizes, averaging out to 400 acres per farm. The old saw is heard in Oxford just like elsewhere in the country, &#x27;Canadians don&#x27;t want to work on farms for the wages offered.&#x27; Filling farm labour needs in Oxford County during growing and harvest seasons includes approximately 2,000 foreign seasonal workers. Oxford is still categorized as an &#x27;emerging community&#x27; by the Living Wage Canada movement.

===Connectivity, connectedness and globalisation===
Due to low population density over most of its territory, Oxford County faced a challenge achieving high-speed internet connectivity for homes and businesses in all areas, but in response to a request for proposals, county council found a contractor able to create a data service network for residents using cellphone tower infrastructure. Internet access has been important to preserving social connectedness as the ongoing process in Oxford of economizing through centralization has caused neighbourhood schools, churches, post offices and businesses to close. Social media has been widely adopted for service delivery by Oxford County council and its various departments.

County residents recognize that quality of life in Oxford is increasingly decided by multinational businesses. When planning on ways to oppose the proposed megadump on the Carmeuse quarry property, the importance of communicating directly with Carmeuse at its head office in Belgium was obvious. Achieving job stability at the CAMI auto assembly plant in Ingersoll required challenging General Motors over threats that the plant&#x27;s production would be moved to Mexico.

==Education==

The Thames Valley District School Board operates five high schools in Oxford – three in Woodstock (Huron Park SS, College Avenue SS and Woodstock Collegiate Institute), Glendale High School in Tillsonburg, and Ingersoll District Collegiate Institute in Ingersoll. The London District Catholic School Board operates St. Mary&#x27;s Catholic High School in Woodstock. The French-language Catholic school board, Providence, operates Ecole Secondaire Catholique Notre-Dame high school in Woodstock. London&#x27;s Fanshawe College operates a regional campus in Woodstock. Kitchener&#x27;s Conestoga College has a skills training centre in Ingersoll. Work towards creation of a university in Oxford County continued for several decades in the second half of the 19th century with the creation of the Canadian Literary Institute (incorporated 1857, later renamed Woodstock College) in Woodstock, but came to an end in the late 1880s when its departments were divided and transferred to Toronto and Hamilton to become today&#x27;s McMaster University.

<text>Perth County is a county and census division in the Canadian province of Ontario in Southwestern Ontario, west of Toronto. Its population centres are Listowel, Mitchell and Milverton. The City of Stratford and the Town of St. Marys are within the Perth census division, but are administered separately from Perth County. The 2021 population of Perth County was 38,066.

==History==

Perth County was settled primarily through the efforts of the Canada Company agency which opened a road from the site of Stratford to Goderich. The settlers were almost equal in number as to their origins: English, Irish, Scottish and German. They began arriving in the 1820s but the majority arrived in the 1830s and the 1840s. Most became farmers, and even today, the county is known for mixed farming, dairying and hog production.

This area originally formed part of the Huron District, which was constituted as the United Counties of Huron, Perth and Bruce in 1850. The County of Perth was given its own Provisional Municipal Council at that time, and was separated from the United Counties in 1853.

It had 11 original townships. Eight of the townships were laid out as part of the Huron Tract, and three more were surveyed from that part of the crown land known as the Queen&#x27;s Bush:

The City of Stratford was formed from parts of Downie, Ellice and Easthope Townships. In 1831 William Sergeant was given a lot by the Canada Company on the condition that he open an inn. In 1832 he erected the first frame building in the region by the Avon River and called it the &quot;Shakespeare Hotel.&quot; First purchaser of land was John Sharman (1834), a blacksmith from Bedfordshire, England. His son, Henry, was the first child born within the limits of the city.

Over time, four additional towns were incorporated as urban municipalities: St. Marys, Mitchell, Listowel and Milverton. On January 1, 1998, the county was restructured by reducing fourteen municipalities to four. The City of Stratford and the Town of St. Marys retained their status as separated municipalities.

<text>Prince Edward County (PEC) is a single-tier municipality in southern Ontario, Canada. Its coastline on Lake Ontario’s northeastern shore is known for Sandbanks Provincial Park, sand beaches, and limestone cliffs. The Regent Theatre, a restored Edwardian Opera House, sits at the heart of the town of Picton on the Bay of Quinte. Nearby Macaulay Heritage Park highlights local history through its 19th-century buildings. In 2016, Prince Edward County had a census population of 24,735. Prince Edward County is a single-tier municipality and a census division of the Canadian province of Ontario.

== History ==
Settled by indigenous peoples, the county has significant archeological sites. These include the LeVescounte Mounds of the Point Peninsula complex people, built about 2000 years ago.

The county was created by Upper Canada&#x27;s founding lieutenant-governor John Graves Simcoe on July 16, 1792. It was named after Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent (the fourth son of King George III and father of Queen Victoria) who was commander-in-chief of British North America.

Shortly after the American Revolution, the Crown made land grants to some of the earliest United Empire Loyalists to encourage their settlements in Ontario and provide compensation for property lost in the Thirteen Colonies. The county was originally composed of three townships named in honour of three of George III&#x27;s daughters.

For many years Prince Edward County has been closely associated with the wholly mainland Hastings County. Its longtime militia unit has been The Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment (locally known as the Hasty Ps), whose most famous member was Farley Mowat. This noted author wrote two books about his experiences with the Hasty Ps during the Second World War&#x27;s Italian Campaign: &quot;The Regiment&quot; and a subsequent account, &quot;And No Birds Sang&quot;.

On January 1, 1998, the Town of Picton, the villages of Bloomfield and Wellington, and the townships of Ameliasburgh, Athol, Hallowell, Hillier, North Marysburgh, Sophiasburgh, and South Marysburgh amalgamated to form a new municipality with the official legal name of Prince Edward County. Each of the former municipalities is now a ward.

=== Former municipalities ===

The following are former municipalities:

*Ameliasburgh, named after Princess Amelia, youngest daughter of George III
*Athol
*Bloomfield
*Hallowell, named after Captain Benjamin Hallowell (1723–1799)), eminent Loyalist, formerly of Boston. He was the father-in-law of Chief Justice John Elmsley.
*Hillier, organized in 1823, and named after Major George Hillier, military secretary to Sir Peregrine Maitland.
*North Marysburgh, surveyed in 1785 and settled by Loyalist veterans, some of Hessian birth. Named for Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, one of George III&#x27;s daughters.
*Sophiasburgh, named for Princess Sophia, one of George III&#x27;s daughters. Surveyed in 1785 and 1787, settled by Loyalists from Nova Scotia and the Mainland.
*South Marysburgh, also named for Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh, one of George III&#x27;s daughters.
*Picton, named for Sir Thomas Picton
*Wellington, named after Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington

== Geography ==
Prince Edward County is located in Southern Ontario on a large irregular headland or littoral at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, just west of the head of the St. Lawrence River. This headland (officially named Prince Edward County in 1792) is surrounded on the north and east by the Bay of Quinte. As the Murray Canal now connects the bay to Lake Ontario across the only land connection, the county is technically an island. Murray Canal is crossed by two, 2-lane swing bridges, the western one on County Road 64, and at the eastern end, the County Road 33 bridge. Bay of Quinte is crossed by two, 2-lane bridges of about 850m length – one carrying Provincial Highway 62 near Belleville and the other about 24 km east carrying Provincial Highway 49 near Deseronto.

=== Climate ===
The county&#x27;s relatively mild humid continental climate (Dfb) due to the influence of Lake Ontario has led to the establishment of about 50 vineyards and close to 30 wineries; as a result, Prince Edward County is one of Ontario&#x27;s designated viticultural areas. The lake effect from Lake Ontario results in heavier snowfall than in neighbouring counties. July is the hottest month and January is the coldest month.

=== Landscape ===

Prince Edward County is a community encompassing approximately , with over of shoreline (including inland lakes and bordered by Lake Ontario) with beaches and limestone rich soil.

=== Communities ===
Prince Edward County includes the population centres of Picton and Wellington and the communities of Albury, Ameliasburg, Bloomfield, Carrying Place, Cherry Valley, Consecon, Cressy, Demorestville, Fawcettville, Glenora, Hillier, Lake on the Mountain, Milford, Mountain View, Northport, Rednersville, Rosehall, Rossmore, Salmon Point, Sophiasburgh, Waupoos, Waupoos Island, West Lake, Woodrous, and Yerexville.

== Demographics ==

== Attractions ==
=== Music festivals ===
Prince Edward County is home to the Music at Port Milford Chamber Music Academy &amp; Festival, Classical Unbound Festival, the PEC Jazz Festival, and the Prince Edward County Chamber Music Festival. 

Music at Port Milford, established in 1987 is said to bring together promising young musicians for a chamber music summer camp and festival on the shores of South Bay. In the summer, PEC also hosts the Classical Unbound Festival, with performances of classical music in unconventional venues and contexts by Canadian musicians, and the Jazz Festival in the month of August. Some of Canada&#x27;s most prolific jazz musicians gather in the county for this festival.

=== Vacationing ===
Prince Edward County has become a vacation destination with Sandbanks Provincial Park, and Ontario&#x27;s newest VQA wine Appellation as the twin centrepieces of the tourism industry. Hotels, motels and bed &amp; breakfast accommodations are abundant.

=== Water activities ===
Prince Edward County&#x27;s main water attractions are said to be its white sand beaches. Together, Sandbanks Provincial Park, North Beach Provincial Park attract over 600,000 visitors yearly. There are numerous campgrounds throughout the County which allow tourists to enjoy water-sports such as those offered through Westlake Wakeboarding School, kayaking, canoeing, tubing, and more.

=== Skateboarding and BMXing ===
Beside the historic Crystal Palace is the County Youth Park. While the region is known for a large retirement community, young people come to the County to visit the skatepark and playground located in the corner of the Picton Fairgrounds property (which also holds the Picton Arena, the Prince Edward Curling Club &amp; Crystal Palace). For example, the YoungLife youth event &quot;Road Rage&quot; had teens of all ages visiting skateboard parks across Ontario and then entering their homemade skateboarding video into a contest; Picton was one of their stops.

=== Dining ===
Prince Edward County in recent years has said to have become a top culinary destination, from the historic Black River Cheese Company which started operations in 1901 to the new LEED-certified, award-winning Fifth Town Artisan Cheese Factory.

The county held the annual Great Canadian Cheese Festival from 2010 through 2017. This festival, held at the Picton Fairgrounds in June, had cheese-makers from all across Canada who offered more than 125 artisan cheeses for tasting and purchase. The festival also included non-cheese related artisan foods such as breads and condiments, wine, cider and craft beer. It has been on hiatus since 2018.

With an increasing number of cultural activities — in part due to the emigration of top artists and chefs to the area – like the &quot;Taste&quot; celebration or &quot;Six Barrels for Six Chefs&quot;, the County has created a niche in the new Creative Economy. “It&#x27;s yet another point of pride for Prince Edward County, which has become the gastronomic capital of Ontario — a fertile island bursting with vineyards, organic farms and a community of artists and chefs. Tucked into the &quot;golden triangle&quot; between Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa, it is the province&#x27;s newest Designated Viticultural Area, which helps identify the origin of a wine and its grapes.” (&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;)

=== Birding ===
Events also include the Spring Birding Festival; Prince Edward County Authors&#x27; Festival; the County Jazz Festival, a summer event; the Prince Edward County Music Festival (a chamber music series) held on the same fall weekend as the Prince Edward County Studio and Gallery Tour; &quot;Music at Port Milford,&quot; a summer music festival and school for string students from 12–18 years old, and an annual season of professional theatre produced by Festival Players of Prince Edward County.

One of the few surviving art-deco movie houses in Ontario, Picton&#x27;s downtown Regent Theatre, is host to a variety of plays, musicals and art movie screenings throughout the year. Prince Edward County has a live comedy scene with Taste That! producing regular improv and sketch comedy shows throughout the County since 2015, and the annual Comedy Country festival that pairs local acts with professional comedians from across Canada. Theatre companies include: the County Stage Company, Prince Edward Community Theatre and The Marysburgh Mummers.

<doc id="627794" wikidata="Q2418385" url="?curid=627794" title="Grani">
<text>In Scandinavian heroic legend, Grani (Old Norse: ) is a horse owned by the hero Sigurd. He is the horse that Sigurd receives through advice from Odin. Grani is a descendant of Odin&#x27;s own steed, Sleipnir.

==Attestations==
In chapter 13 of &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;, the hero Sigurðr is on his way to a wood when he meets a long-bearded old man he had never seen before. Sigurd tells the old man that he is going to choose a horse, and asks the old man to come with him to help him decide. The old man says that they should drive the horses down to the river Busiltjörn. The two drive the horses down into the deeps of Busiltjörn, and all of the horses swim back to land but a large, young, and handsome gray horse that no one had ever mounted. The grey-bearded old man says that the horse is from &quot;Sleipnir&#x27;s kin&quot; and that &quot;he must be nourished heedfully, for it will be the best of all horses&quot;. The old man vanishes. Sigurd names the horse Grani, and the narrative adds that the old man was none other than Odin.

==Archeological evidence==

Grani is believed to be depicted on several of the Sigurd stones, which depict imagery from the legend of Sigurd the dragon slayer, including the inscription on Sö 327 in Gök, Södermanland County, Sweden. In Norse iconography, the depiction of a horse carrying a chest was sufficient to represent Grani carrying the treasure after Sigurd had slain the dragon Fafnir. This is supported by a kenning in a Norse poem that refers to &quot;Grani&#x27;s beauteous burden,&quot; indicating a common understanding of the motif.

==Modern influence==
In Wagner&#x27;s Ring cycle of operas the name (as &quot;Grane&quot;) is given to Brünnhilde&#x27;s horse.

In &quot;Digimon Tamers&quot;, Grani was the name of the refitted &#x27;Ark&#x27;, which was used as a steed by Gallantmon late in the series. It was directly stated in episode 47 that it was named by its creators after Siegfried&#x27;s horse, Grani. Grani would later be used to upgrade Gallantmon into his Crimson Mode during the finale of the series and in one of the theatrical movies.

Grani also forms the theoretical Old Norse root of the etymology of the island of Guernsey via Anglo-Norman, from &quot;Granis&quot; (Grani&#x27;s) + &quot;ey&quot; (dialectical term for &quot;little island&quot;); although it is probable that this was from a Viking&#x27;s personal name rather than a direct appellation to the divine horse.

In &quot;Fire Emblem Heroes&quot;, Grani&#x27;s Shield is a skill that protects cavalry units against bonus damage from enemies who have anti-cavalry weapons.

In &quot;Final Fantasy XIV&quot;, Grani is a mount available to players that pre-ordered the &quot;Shadowbringers&quot; expansion. It is described in-game as a &quot;heroic steed from a realm not your own.&quot;

In &quot;Arknights&quot;, Grani is a character based on a horse-inspired race.

In &quot;Granblue Fantasy&quot;, Grani can be fought as a raid boss and be obtained as a summon.

<text>Father Brown is a fictional Roman Catholic priest and amateur detective. He is featured in 53 short stories by English author G. K. Chesterton, published between 1910 and 1936. Father Brown solves mysteries and crimes using his intuition and keen understanding of human nature. Chesterton loosely based him on the Rt Rev. Msgr John O&#x27;Connor (1870–1952), a parish priest in Bradford, who was involved in Chesterton&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism in 1922. Since 2013, the character has been portrayed by Mark Williams in the ongoing BBC television series &quot;Father Brown&quot;.

==Character==

Father Brown is a short, plain Roman Catholic priest, with shapeless clothes, a large umbrella, and an uncanny insight into human behaviour. His unremarkable, seemingly naïve appearance hides an unexpectedly sharp intelligence and keen powers of observation. Brown uses his unimposing demeanor to his advantage when studying criminals, to whom he seems to pose no danger, making him a precursor, in some ways, to Agatha Christie&#x27;s later detective character Miss Marple. His job as a priest allows him to blend into the background of a crime scene, as others can easily assume he is merely there on spiritual business.

In early stories, Brown is said to be priest for the fictitious small parish of Cobhole in Essex (although it is never named as the actual location of any of them), but he relocates to London and travels to many other places, in England and abroad, during the course of the stories. Much of his background is never disclosed, including his age, family, and domestic arrangements. Even his first name is never made clear; in the story &quot;The Eye of Apollo&quot;, he is described as &quot;the Reverend J. Brown&quot; (perhaps in tribute to John O&#x27;Connor), while in &quot;The Sign of the Broken Sword&quot;, he is apparently named Paul.

Brown&#x27;s crimesolving method can be described as intuitive and psychological; his process is to reconstruct the perpetrator&#x27;s methods and motives using imaginative empathy, combined with an encyclopaedic criminal knowledge he has picked up from parishioner confessions. While Brown&#x27;s cases follow the &quot;Fair Play&quot; rules of classic detective fiction, the crime, once revealed, often turns out to be implausible in its practical details. A typical Father Brown story aims not so much to invent a believable criminological procedure as to propose a novel paradox with subtle moral and theological implications.

The stories normally contain a rational explanation of who the murderer was and how Brown worked it out. He always emphasises rationality; some stories, such as &quot;The Miracle of Moon Crescent&quot;, &quot;The Oracle of the Dog&quot;, &quot;The Blast of the Book&quot; and &quot;The Dagger with Wings&quot;, poke fun at initially sceptical characters who become convinced of a supernatural explanation for some strange occurrence, but Father Brown easily sees the perfectly ordinary, natural explanation. In fact, he seems to represent an ideal of a devout but considerably educated and &quot;civilised&quot; clergyman. That can be traced to the influence of Roman Catholic thought on Chesterton. Father Brown is characteristically humble and is usually rather quiet, except to say something profound. Although he tends to handle crimes with a steady, realistic approach, he believes in the supernatural as the greatest reason of all.

==Background==
When he created Father Brown, the English writer G. K. Chesterton was already famous in Britain and America for his philosophical and paradox-laden fiction and nonfiction, including the novel &quot;The Man Who Was Thursday&quot;, the theological work &quot;Orthodoxy&quot;, several literary studies, and many brief essays. Father Brown makes his first appearance in the story &quot;The Blue Cross&quot; published in 1910 and continues to appear throughout fifty short stories in five volumes, with two more stories discovered and published posthumously, often assisted in his crime-solving by the reformed criminal M. Hercule Flambeau.

Father Brown also appears in a third story—making a total of fifty-three—that did not appear in the five volumes published in Chesterton&#x27;s lifetime, &quot;The Donnington Affair&quot;, which has a curious history. In the October 1914 issue of an obscure magazine, &quot;The Premier&quot;, Sir Max Pemberton wrote the first part of the story, then invited Chesterton, to complete the story. Chesterton solution followed in the November issue. The story was first reprinted in the &quot;Chesterton Review&quot; in 1981, and published in book form in the 1987 collection &quot;Thirteen Detectives&quot;.

Many of the &quot;Father Brown&quot; stories were produced for financial reasons and at great speed. Chesterton wrote in 1920 that &quot;I think it only fair to confess that I have myself written some of the worst mystery stories in the world.&quot; At the time he wrote this, Chesterton had given up writing Father Brown stories, though he would later return to them; 25 Father Brown stories were first published between 1910 and 1914; another 18 between 1923 and 1927; and the last 10 between 1930 and 1936.

Father Brown was a vehicle for conveying Chesterton&#x27;s worldview and, of all of his characters, is perhaps closest to Chesterton&#x27;s own point of view, or at least the effect of his point of view. Father Brown solves his crimes through a strict reasoning process more concerned with spiritual and philosophic truths than with scientific details, making him an almost equal counterbalance to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes, whose stories Chesterton read.

==Legacy==

Although Chesterton himself saw them as ephemeral, the Father Brown stories became his most lastingly popular works, remaining a familiar classic of detective fiction into the twenty-first century. T. J. Binyon, in a 1989 survey of fictional detectives, concluded that Father Brown had achieved a fame nearly as great as that of Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot. As Chesterton was already a well-established literary figure before creating Father Brown, the stories&#x27; popularity also had a positive impact on detective fiction as a whole, lending the genre further credibility.

Most historians of the Golden Age of Detective Fiction have ranked the Father Brown stories among the best of the genre. Binyon noted that while &quot;the best of the stories are undoubted masterpieces, brilliantly and poetically written&quot;, they often hinge on crimes &quot;so fantastic as to render the whole story absurd&quot;; however, &quot;Chesterton&#x27;s skill as a writer manifests itself precisely in the way in which the moral aspects are concealed&quot;, allowing an astute reader to enjoy the stories as parables. Antonio Gramsci, who found the stories &quot;delicious&quot; in their juxtaposition of heightened poetic style and detective-story plotting, argued that Brown was a quintessentially Catholic figure, whose nuanced psychology and moral integrity stand in sharp contrast to &quot;the mechanical thought processes of the Protestants&quot; and make Sherlock Holmes &quot;look like a pretentious little boy&quot;.

Kingsley Amis, who called the stories &quot;wonderfully organized puzzles that tell an overlooked truth&quot;, argued that they show Chesterton &quot;in top form&quot; as a writer of literary Impressionism, creating &quot;some of the finest, and least regarded descriptive writing of this century&quot;:

P. D. James highlights the stories&#x27; &quot;variety of pleasures, including their ingenuity, their wit and intelligence, […] the brilliance of the writing&quot;, and especially their insight into &quot;the greatest of all problems, the vagaries of the human heart.&quot;

==Adaptations==
===Film===
*Walter Connolly starred as the title character in the 1934 film &quot;Father Brown, Detective&quot;, based on &quot;The Blue Cross&quot;. Connolly would later be cast as another famous fictional detective, Nero Wolfe, in the 1937 film &quot;The League of Frightened Men&quot; and played Charlie Chan on NBC radio from 1932 to 1938.
*The 1954 film &quot;Father Brown&quot; (released in the US as &quot;The Detective&quot;) featured Alec Guinness as Father Brown. Like the 1934 film starring Connolly, it was based on &quot;The Blue Cross&quot;. An experience while playing the character reportedly prompted Guinness&#x27;s own conversion to Roman Catholicism.
*Heinz Rühmann played Father Brown in two West German adaptations of Chesterton&#x27;s stories, &quot;Das schwarze Schaf&quot; (&quot;The Black Sheep&quot;, 1960) and &quot;Er kann&#x27;s nicht lassen&quot; (&quot;He Can&#x27;t Stop Doing It&quot;, 1962) with both music scores written by German composer Martin Böttcher. In these films Brown is an Irish priest. The actor later appeared in &quot;Operazione San Pietro&quot; (also starring Edward G. Robinson, 1967) as Cardinal Brown, but the film is not based on any Chesterton story.

===Radio===
*A Mutual Broadcasting System radio series, &quot;The Adventures of Father Brown&quot; (1945), featured Karl Swenson as Father Brown, Bill Griffis as Flambeau and Gretchen Douglas as Nora, the rectory housekeeper.
*In 1974, to celebrate the centenary of Chesterton&#x27;s birth, five Father Brown stories starring Leslie French as Father Brown and Willie Rushton as Chesterton were broadcast on BBC Radio 4.
*BBC Radio 4 produced a series of &quot;Father Brown Stories&quot; from 1984 to 1986, starring Andrew Sachs as Father Brown.
* A series of 16 Chesterton stories was produced by the Colonial Radio Theatre in Boston, Massachusetts. Actor J. T. Turner played Father Brown; all scripts were written by British radio dramatist M. J. Elliott. &quot;Imagination Theater&quot; added this series to their rotation with the broadcast of &quot;The Hammer of God&quot; on 5 May 2013.

===Television===
*&quot;The Quick One&quot; was adapted for the 1964 BBC anthology series &quot;Detective&quot;, with Mervyn Johns as Father Brown.
*Josef Meinrad played Father Brown in an Austrian TV series (1966–72), which followed Chesterton&#x27;s plots quite closely. 
*In 1974, Kenneth More starred in a 13-episode &quot;Father Brown&quot; TV series, each episode adapted from one of Chesterton&#x27;s short stories. The series, produced by Sir Lew Grade for Associated Television, was shown in the United States as part of PBS&#x27;s &quot;Mystery!&quot;. They were released on DVD in the UK in 2003 by Acorn Media UK, and in the United States four years later by Acorn Media.
*A US film made for television, &quot;Sanctuary of Fear&quot; (1979), starred Barnard Hughes as an Americanised, modernised Father Brown in Manhattan, New York City, and Kay Lenz, as Carol Bains. The film was intended as the pilot for a series but critical and audience reaction was unfavourable, largely due to the changes made to the character, and the mundane thriller plot.
*An Italian television miniseries in six episodes, &quot;I racconti di padre Brown&quot; (&quot;The Tales of Father Brown&quot;) starring Renato Rascel in the title role and Arnoldo Foà as Flambeau was produced and broadcast by the national TV RAI between December 1970 and February 1971 to a wide audience (one episode peaked at 12 million viewers).
* &quot;The Blast of the Book&quot; was adapted into a Soviet stop-motion short in 1990.
*A Catholic cable channel, EWTN, produced the Father Brown story &quot;The Honour of Israel Gow&quot; as a 2009 episode of the television series &quot;The Theater of the Word&quot;.
*A German television series superficially based on the character of Father Brown, &quot;Pfarrer Braun&quot;, was launched in 2003. Pfarrer Guido Braun, from Bavaria, played by Ottfried Fischer, solves murder cases on the (fictitious) island of Nordersand in the first two episodes. Later, other German landscapes like the Harz, the Rhine, and Meißen in Saxony became sets for the show. Martin Böttcher again wrote the score and he was instructed by the producers to write a title theme hinting at the theme of the movies with Heinz Rühmann. Twenty-two episodes were made, which ran very successfully in Germany on ARD. The 22nd episode, which was aired on 20 March 2014, concluded the series with the death of the protagonist.
*In 2012, the BBC commissioned the 10-episode series &quot;Father Brown&quot; starring British actor Mark Williams in the title role. It aired on BBC One beginning January 2013, Monday to Friday, over a two-week period in the afternoon. The era and location are moved to the Cotswolds of the early 1950s and used adaptations and original stories. Filming for the series began around the Cotswolds in the summer of 2012. By 2024, 120 episodes had been aired across 11 series.

===Audio===
*Ignatius Press published an audiobook version of &quot;The Innocence of Father Brown&quot; in 2008. The book is read by actor Kevin O&#x27;Brien and features introductions to each story written and read by Dale Ahlquist, president of the American Chesterton Society. The book was a winner of the 2009 Foreword Audio Book Awards.

== Appearances and references in other works ==

===Literature===
In Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, a quote from &quot;The Queer Feet&quot; is an important element of the structure and theme of the book. Waugh&#x27;s novel quotes Father Brown&#x27;s line after catching a criminal, hearing his confession, and letting him go: &quot;I caught him, with an unseen hook and an invisible line which is long enough to let him wander to the ends of the world, and still to bring him back with a twitch upon the thread.&quot; In Book Three of &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, titled &quot;A Twitch Upon the Thread&quot;, the quotation acts as a metaphor for the operation of grace in the characters&#x27; lives.

Father Brown has occasionally also appeared as a character in works not by Chesterton. In the novel &quot;The D Case&quot; by Carlo Fruttero and Franco Lucentini, Father Brown joins forces with other famous fictional detectives to solve Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot;. The American Chesterton Society published John Peterson&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Father Brown&quot;, a further forty-four mysteries solved by a Father Brown living in the United States in his nineties. In the Italian novel &quot;Il destino di Padre Brown&quot; (&quot;The Destiny of Father Brown&quot;) by Paolo Gulisano, the priest detective is elected pope after Pius XI with the pontifical name of &quot;Innocent XIV&quot;.

===Other===
* Father Brown is one of the detectives on whom Tommy draws inspiration in Agatha Christie&#x27;s series of short stories featuring Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, published in 1929 under the title &quot;Partners in Crime&quot;. In &quot;The Man in the Mist&quot;, Tommy is dressed as a Catholic priest and his method of investigation refers expressly to those used by Father Brown.
* Ralph McInerny used Father Brown as the spiritual inspiration for his Father Dowling pilot script which launched &quot;The Father Dowling Mysteries&quot;, a television series that ran from 1987 to 1991 on US television. An anthology of the two detectives&#x27; stories, titled &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill: Father Brown, Father Dowling and Other Ecclesiastical Sleuths&quot;, was released in 1992.
* Father Brown was highlighted in volume 13 of the &quot;Case Closed&quot; manga&#x27;s edition of &quot;Gosho Aoyama&#x27;s Mystery Library&quot;, a section of the graphic novels where the author introduces a different detective (or occasionally, a villain) from mystery literature, television, or other media.
* In the mobile game Fate/Grand Order, in an effort to thwart James Moriarty after his own defeat of Sherlock Holmes, the characters summon up a number of &quot;Phantom Spirits&quot; of fictional detectives that were inspired by or followed after Holmes. The first to appear is a shadowy spirit described simply as &quot;Round-Faced Priest&quot;, with the outline and vague features closely resembling the appearance of Father Brown in the &quot;Case Closed&quot; appearance.

<doc id="627802" wikidata="Q2007458" url="?curid=627802" title="Gauntlet Legends">
<text>Gauntlet Legends is an arcade game released in 1998 by Atari Games and Midway Games. It is a fantasy themed hack and slash styled dungeon crawl game, a sequel to 1985&#x27;s popular &quot;Gauntlet&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;Gauntlet II&quot; and marks the final game in the series to be produced by Atari Games. Its unusual features for an arcade game included passwords and characters that could be saved, enabling players to play over the course of a long period.

The game was given an expansion called &quot;Gauntlet Dark Legacy&quot;, which featured new characters to play and new levels.

==Gameplay==
In ages past, a corrupt mage named Garm used a set of Runestones to summon a demon named Skorne. However, Skorne crushed Garm and imprisoned his soul in the Underworld. Skorne, fearing the power of the Runestones, scattered them throughout the four realms, so that they could never be used against him. The player(s) must defeat the end bosses of each of the four kingdoms to obtain the four keys which allow access to the desecrated temple and be able to banish Skorne to the Underworld. While traveling through each realm, they must also collect the Thirteen Runestones from where they have been scattered. The complete set of Runestones allows them to pursue Skorne to the Underworld in order to finally destroy him. The players must find three rune stones on each kingdom in order to defeat Skorne in the Underworld (in the arcades only), and one from the battle grounds (home versions only). The initial arcade version had a contest by which the first 500 players to complete the game and send in the supplied validation code would win a free &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; shirt. This game will not end unless the player runs out of health.

A new aspect of the &quot;Gauntlet&quot; series is established in &quot;Legends&quot;: the ability to level up the player&#x27;s character(s) as the game is played, increasing their abilities through experience earned by slaying enemies and acquiring treasure, similar to the character progression methods in many role-playing video games. The four primary attributes are:
*Strength - Determines damage dealt by physical attacks.
*Speed - Determines character movement and attack rates.
*Armor - Determines amount of damage character takes from enemy attacks.
*Magic - Determines the range and effectiveness of magic potion attacks

Attributes increase with each level attained; increases can also be purchased from the Items menu with gold acquired in gameplay.

The stock fantasy characters from the original &quot;Gauntlet&quot; return for &quot;Legends&quot;; as before, each has greater starting ability in a single attribute than their fellows.
*Warrior/Minotaur - Strength
*Wizard/Jackal/Sumner - Magic
*Archer/Tigress - Speed
*Valkyrie/Falconess - Armor

Character progression is saved through a password system; a player can progress all four characters to a maximum level of 99, and each of their attributes to a maximum of 999.

==Ports==
The first home console port of &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; was released for the Nintendo 64 in September 1999 in North America. This port saw a European release by the end of the year, and it was the exclusive platform for the Japanese release in the following year, on April 7, 2000. It can support up to four players by using the Expansion Pak, or up to three when using the standard Jumper Pak. It requires a Controller Pak to save game progress, and it is compatible with the Rumble Pak.

Though it was originally planned to be released in 1999 alongside the Nintendo 64 version, the PlayStation port was released in 2000 for North America and Europe. Unlike the other versions, this release only supports one or two players, as it omitted multitap support.

The Dreamcast port was also released in 2000 for North America and Europe. It incorporated much of the features from &quot;Gauntlet Dark Legacy&quot;.

==Reception==
The arcade version received favorable reviews. Dan Elektro of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;Overall, &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; takes advantage of the 3D space and uses it as much more than a gimmick. [...] &quot;Gauntlet&quot; deserved an update—and the legend has been treated with befitting respect.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the game in their March 1, 1999 issue as the sixth most-successful dedicated arcade game of the previous year.

The PlayStation version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Greg Orlando of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the Dreamcast version, &quot;Four controllers and one &quot;Legends&quot; make for party-game excitement of the highest order.&quot;

Vicious Sid of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the N64 version in one review, &quot;&quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it&#x27;s an impressive port of a polished arcade game that manages to cram in some extra playability to boot. If role-playing with an arcade twist lights your fire, you&#x27;ll combust with &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot;.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, Ash said, &quot;Die-hard fans of &quot;Gauntlet&quot; will especially want to own this game, but it&#x27;s also a great one for gamers who love the idea of intense multiplayer action. It doesn&#x27;t get much better than wasting line after line of grunts with a group of friends.&quot; Boba Fatt later said that the PlayStation version &quot;makes up for its crimes with a responsive, though complicated, interface and a strong two-player performance. Ultimately, this is a rental at best, unless you&#x27;re a huge fan of the arcade version.&quot; Dan Elektro said in one &quot;GamePro&quot; review, &quot;With all the hidden stuff and the reworked sections, &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; on the Dreamcast feels as fresh as a newly minted quarter.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, The D-Pad Destroyer said, &quot;If you like mindless action, gather some friends and play &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; for a day or two. As long as you&#x27;re not looking for depth, you&#x27;ll enjoy walking thigh-deep in bad guys and knocking over barrels in a desperate quest for food.&quot;

During the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Nintendo 64 version was nominated for the &quot;Console Action Game of the Year&quot; award, which went to &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;. Likewise, the same console version was a nominee for &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s 1999 &quot;Nintendo 64&quot; award, which went to &quot;Rayman 2: The Great Escape&quot;. It was also nominated for the &quot;Best Console Multiplayer Game of the Year&quot; at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister Awards 1999, which went to &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Jack&quot;.

<text>Vehicle emissions control is the study of reducing the emissions produced by motor vehicles, especially internal combustion engines. The primary emissions studied include hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and sulfur oxides. Starting in the 1950s and 1960s, various regulatory agencies were formed with a primary focus on studying the vehicle emissions and their effects on human health and the environment. As the worlds understanding of vehicle emissions improved, so did the devices used to mitigate their impacts. The regulatory requirements of the Clean Air Act, which was amended many times, greatly restricted acceptable vehicle emissions. With the restrictions, vehicles started being designed more efficiently by utilizing various emission control systems and devices which became more common in vehicles over time.

==Types of emissions==
Emissions of many air pollutants have been shown to have variety of negative effects on public health and the natural environment. Emissions that are principal pollutants of concern include:
* Hydrocarbons (HC) – A class of burned or partially burned fuel, hydrocarbons are toxins. Hydrocarbons are a major contributor to smog, which can be a major problem in urban areas. Prolonged exposure to hydrocarbons contributes to asthma, liver disease, lung disease, and cancer. Regulations governing hydrocarbons vary according to type of engine and jurisdiction; in some cases, &quot;non-methane hydrocarbons&quot; are regulated, while in other cases, &quot;total hydrocarbons&quot; are regulated. Technology for one application (to meet a non-methane hydrocarbon standard) may not be suitable for use in an application that has to meet a total hydrocarbon standard. Methane is not directly toxic, but is more difficult to break down in fuel vent lines and a charcoal canister is meant to collect and contain fuel vapors and route them either back to the fuel tank or, after the engine is started and warmed up, into the air intake to be burned in the engine.
* Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) – Organic compounds which typically have a boiling point less than or equal to 250 °C; for example chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and formaldehyde.
* Carbon monoxide (CO) – A product of incomplete combustion, inhaled carbon monoxide reduces the blood&#x27;s ability to carry oxygen; overexposure (carbon monoxide poisoning) may be fatal. (Carbon monoxide persistently binds to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying chemical in red blood cells, where oxygen (O2) would temporarily bind. The bonding of CO excludes O2 and also reduces the ability of the hemoglobin to release already-bound oxygen, on both counts rendering the red blood cells ineffective. Recovery is by the slow release of bound CO and the body&#x27;s production of new hemoglobina healing processso full recovery from moderate to severe [but nonfatal] CO poisoning takes hours or days. Removing a person from a CO-poisoned atmosphere to fresh air stops the injury but does not yield prompt recovery, unlike the case where a person is removed from an asphyxiating atmosphere [i.e. one deficient in oxygen]. Toxic effects delayed by days are also common.)
* Nitrogen oxides (NOx) – Generated when nitrogen in the air reacts with oxygen at the high temperature and pressure inside the engine. NOx is a precursor to smog and acid rain. NOx includes NO and NO2. NO2 is extremely reactive. NOx production is increased when an engine runs at its most efficient (i.e. hottest) operating point, so there tends to be a natural tradeoff between efficiency and control of NOx emissions. It is expected to be reduced drastically by use of emulsion fuels.
* Particulate matter – Soot or smoke made up of particles in the micrometre size range: Particulate matter causes negative health effects, including but not limited to respiratory disease and cancer. Very fine particulate matter has been linked to cardiovascular disease.
* Sulfur oxide (SOx) – A general term for oxides of sulfur, which are emitted from motor vehicles burning fuel containing sulfur. Reducing the level of fuel sulfur reduces the level of sulfur oxides emitted from the tailpipe.

==History==

Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, various federal, state and local governments in the United States conducted studies into the numerous sources of air pollution. These studies ultimately attributed a significant portion of air pollution to the automobile, and concluded air pollution is not bounded by local political boundaries. At that time, such minimal emission control regulations as existed in the U.S. were promulgated at the municipal or, occasionally, the state level. The ineffective local regulations were gradually supplanted by more comprehensive state and federal regulations. By 1967 the State of California created the California Air Resources Board, and in 1970, the federal United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was established. Both agencies, as well as other state agencies, now create and enforce emission regulations for automobiles in the United States. Similar agencies and regulations were contemporaneously developed and implemented in Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and Japan.

The first effort at controlling pollution from automobiles was the PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) system. This draws crankcase fumes heavy in unburned hydrocarbons – a precursor to photochemical smog – into the engine&#x27;s intake tract so they are burned rather than released unburned from the crankcase into the atmosphere. Positive crankcase ventilation was first installed on a widespread basis by law on all new 1961-model cars first sold in California. The following year, New York required it. By 1964, most new cars sold in the U.S. were so equipped, and PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide.

The first legislated exhaust (tailpipe) emission standards were promulgated by the State of California for 1966 model year for cars sold in that state, followed by the United States as a whole in model year 1968. Also in 1966, the first emission test cycle was enacted in the State of California measuring tailpipe emissions in PPM (parts per million). The standards were progressively tightened year by year, as mandated by the EPA.

By the 1974 model year, the United States emission standards had tightened such that the de-tuning techniques used to meet them were seriously reducing engine efficiency and thus increasing fuel usage. The new emission standards for 1975 model year, as well as the increase in fuel usage, forced the invention of the catalytic converter for after-treatment of the exhaust gas. This was not possible with existing leaded gasoline, because the lead residue contaminated the platinum catalyst. In 1972, General Motors proposed to the American Petroleum Institute the elimination of leaded fuels for 1975 and later model year cars. The production and distribution of unleaded fuel was a major challenge, but it was completed successfully in time for the 1975 model year cars. All modern cars are now equipped with catalytic converters to further reduce vehicle emissions.

Leading up to the 1981 model year in the United States, passenger vehicle manufactures were faced with the challenges in its history of meeting new emissions regulations, how to meet the much more restrictive requirements of the Clean Air Act (United States) per the 1977 amendment. For example: to meet this challenge, General Motors created a new &quot;Emissions Control Systems Project Center&quot; (ECS) first located at the AC Spark Plug Engineering Building in Flint, Michigan. Its purpose was to &quot;Have overall responsibility for the design and development of the carborated and fuel injected closed loop 3-way catalyst system including related electronic controls, fuel metering, spark control, idle speed control, EGR, etc. currently planned through 1981.&quot;

In 1990, the Clean Air Act (CAA) was amended to help further regulate harmful vehicle emissions. In the amendment, vehicle fuel regulations became more stringent by limiting how much sulfur was allowed in diesel fuel. The amendments also required a procedural change for the creation of gasoline to ensure there are less emissions of hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Changes made to the CAA also required the use of oxygenated gasoline to reduce CO emissions.

Throughout the years, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) continued to implement new regulations to reduce harmful emissions for vehicles. Some of the more important update standards are as follows.

* 1983: For areas with big pollution problems, Inspection and Maintenance programs were created, meaning vehicles would need to get tested for emissions.
* 1985: Changed the allowable amount of gasoline to 0.1 grams per gallon.
* 1991: Lowed the allowable emissions of HC and NOx for vehicle tailpipes
* 1993: Began developing new vehicle technology to help triple the fuel economy in family sedans, thus reducing harmful emissions.
* 1996: Lead in gasoline officially banned. New regulations created with intentions of innovating vehicle design to be cleaner for the environment and improving engine performance.
* 1998: Diesel engine standards further increased in efforts to reduce ozone and PM emissions for various vehicles including industrial equipment.
* 1999: Tailpipe emission standards are finalized, sulfur contents in gasoline are reduced, and various boats/other marine vehicles using diesel had reduced emission limits for NOx and PM.

=== History of lead in gasoline ===
In 1922, lead was added to gasoline as an antiknock agent. It was not until 1969, nearly five decades later, that research began to show the negative health affects related to lead as a pollutant. Despite the plethora of negative health impacts discovered, no regulatory requirements were implemented to reduce lead levels in gasoline until 1983. Slowly, countries began banning use of lead in gasoline entirely from the years of 1986 to 2021. Japan was first to ban lead in gasoline in 1986, with North and South America following with nearly every country in the two continents banning lead by 1998. Africa was the latest to ban lead in gasoline with most countries banning in 2004 and 2005 and the last, Algeria, which didn’t ban it until 2021.

==Regulatory agencies==
The agencies charged with implementing exhaust emission standards vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, even in the same country. For example, in the United States, overall responsibility belongs to the EPA, but due to special requirements of the State of California, emissions in California are regulated by the Air Resources Board. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission is responsible for regulating emissions from LPG-fueled rich burn engines (but not gasoline-fueled rich burn engines).

===North America===
* California Air Resources Board – California, United States (most sources)
* Environment Canada – Canada (most sources)
* Environmental Protection Agency – United States (most sources)
* Texas Railroad Commission – Texas, United States (LPG-fueled engines only)
* Transport Canada – Canada (trains and ships)

===Japan===
* Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism / Road Transport Bureau / Environmental Policy Division

===Europe===
The European Union has control over regulation of emissions in EU member states; however, many member states have their own government bodies to enforce and implement these regulations in their respective countries. In short, the EU forms the policy (by setting limits such as the European emission standard) and the member states decide how to best implement it in their own country.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, matters concerning environmental policy are &quot;devolved powers&quot; so that some of the constituent countries deal with it separately through their own government bodies set up to deal with environmental issues:
* Environment Agency – England and Wales
* Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) – Scotland
* Department of the Environment – Northern Ireland

However, many UK-wide policies are handled by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and they are still subject to EU regulations.

Emissions tests on diesel cars have not been carried out during MOTs in Northern Ireland for 12 years, despite being legally required.

=== China ===
* Ministry of Ecology and Environment – Primary regulatory authority responsible for environmental protection, formulates policies, standards, and regulations which encompass vehicle emissions, and environmental impact assessments.
* Ministry of Industry and Information Technology – Creates and establishes goals for new energy vehicles (NEV), and commercial vehicles. Also plays a role in creating national emissions standards for cars.
* State Administration for Market Regulation – Responsible for market supervision and standardization in China. The State Administration for Market Regulation oversees the enforcement of vehicle emissions standards and ensures compliance by conducting inspections, testing, and quality control measures.
* National Development and Reform Commission - Responsible for macroeconomic planning and formulating energy-related policies in China. The National Development and Reform Commission plays a role on fuel efficiency standards, promoting alternative fuels, and implementing energy-saving measures to reduce emissions from vehicles.
* China Automotive Technology &amp; Research Center - An independent research institution commissioned by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, to research, develop and draft the standards for fuel consumption limits of motor vehicles.
* Ministry of Transport of the People&#x27;s Republic of China - While it is unclear whether this ministry has legal authority on whether they can enforce these standards, the Ministry of Transport will not issue commercial licenses to any heavy-duty vehicles that don&#x27;t meet fuel consumption requirements they have set.
* Provincial and Municipal Environmental Protection Bureaus - At the provincial and municipal level these Bureaus are responsible for enforcing regulations such as those related to vehicle emissions. These bureaus monitor compliance, conduct inspections, and impose penalties for non-compliance.

==Emission control system design==
It was very important to system designers to meet the emission requirements using a minimum quantity of catalyst material (platinum and/or palladium) due to cost and supply issues.
The General Motors &quot;Emissions Control Systems Project Center&quot; was &quot;to follow the operational plans established by previous (GM) Project Centers. Items unique to the &quot;Emissions Control Systems Project Center&quot; (were):
* No Designers - all design work to be done at home divisions.
* Planning activity which will provide the official timing charts, component costs, allocations, etc.

The (&quot;Emissions Control Systems Project Center&quot;) (had) seven tasks to perform, such that an emission system, which passes all existing Federal Emission and Fuel Economy legislation is put into production.

These are to work with the car divisions to:
# Define hardware and system requirements.
# Develop design specifications for all hardware all hardware required.
# Review alternative designs and systems.
# Arrange to test and validate systems, which best suits the needs of all concerned.
# Monitor component design and release.
# Follow progress of divisional certification work.
# Keep management and divisions apprised of progress status.

The system implementation (was to) be phased in over three years. In the 1979 model year. California vehicles with 2.5, 2.8 and 3.5 liter engines will have a CLCC system. In 1980 model year, vehicles sold in California and 3.8 and 4.3 liter engines sold federally will have CLCC, and finally in the 1981 model year all passenger cars will have the system. California light and medium duty trucks may also use the c-4 system. While 1979 and 1980 systems are very similar, the 1981 system (2nd generation) will differ in that it may include additional engine control systems (i.e., electronic spark timing, idle speed control, etc.)

The Emission Control System under development has been designated C-4.This stands for Computer Controlled Catalytic Converter. The C-4 System encompasses Closed Loop Carburetor Control (CLCC) and Throttle Body Injection (TBI) systems.&quot;&quot;

==Emissions control==
Engine efficiency has been steadily improved with improved engine design, more precise ignition timing and electronic ignition, more precise fuel metering, and computerized engine management.

Advances in engine and vehicle technology continually reduce the toxicity of exhaust leaving the engine, but these alone have generally been proved insufficient to meet emissions goals. Therefore, technologies to detoxify the exhaust are an essential part of emissions control.

===Air injection===

One of the first-developed exhaust emission control systems is secondary air injection. Originally, this system was used to inject air into the engine&#x27;s exhaust ports to provide oxygen so unburned and partially burned hydrocarbons in the exhaust would finish burning. Air injection is now used to support the catalytic converter&#x27;s oxidation reaction, and to reduce emissions when an engine is started from cold.
After a cold start, an engine needs an air-fuel mixture richer than what it needs at operating temperature, and the catalytic converter does not function efficiently until it has reached its own operating temperature. The air injected upstream of the converter supports combustion in the exhaust headpipe, which speeds catalyst warmup and reduces the amount of unburned hydrocarbon emitted from the tailpipe.

===Exhaust gas recirculation===

In the United States and Canada, many engines in 1973 and newer vehicles (1972 and newer in California) have a system that routes a metered amount of exhaust into the intake tract under particular operating conditions. Exhaust neither burns nor supports combustion, so it dilutes the air/fuel charge to reduce peak combustion chamber temperatures. This, in turn, reduces the formation of NOx.

===Catalytic converter===

The catalytic converter is a device placed in the exhaust pipe, which converts hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and NOx into less harmful gases by using a combination of platinum, palladium and rhodium as catalysts.

There are two types of catalytic converter, a two-way and a three-way converter. Two-way converters were common until the 1980s, when three-way converters replaced them on most automobile engines. See the catalytic converter article for further details.

==Evaporative emissions control==

Evaporative emissions are the result of gasoline vapors escaping from the vehicle&#x27;s fuel system. Since 1971, all U.S. vehicles have had fully sealed fuel systems that do not vent directly to the atmosphere; mandates for systems of this type appeared contemporaneously in other jurisdictions. In a typical system, vapors from the fuel tank and carburetor bowl vent (on carbureted vehicles) are ducted to canisters containing activated carbon. The vapors are adsorbed within the canister, and during certain engine operational modes fresh air is drawn through the canister, pulling the vapor into the engine, where it burns.

==Remote sensing emission testing==
Some US states are also using a technology which uses infrared and ultraviolet light to detect emissions while vehicles pass by on public roads, thus eliminating the need for owners to go to a test center. Invisible light flash detection of exhaust gases is commonly used in metropolitan areas, and becoming more broadly known in Europe.

===Use of emission test data===
Emission test results from individual vehicles are in many cases compiled to evaluate the emissions performance of various classes of vehicles, the efficacy of the testing program and of various other emission-related regulations (such as changes to fuel formulations) and to model the effects of auto emissions on public health and the environment.

==Alternative fuel vehicles==
Exhaust emissions can be reduced by making use of clean vehicle propulsion. The most popular modes include hybrid and electric vehicles. , China had the world&#x27;s largest stock of highway legal plug-in electric passenger cars with 4.5 million units, representing 42% of the world&#x27;s stock of plug-in cars.

<text>The United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry (SDG) is a county and census division in the Canadian province of Ontario, that comprises three historical counties. The county&#x27;s administrative office is located within the City of Cornwall, which, together with the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne, is geographically within the county but administered independently.

The United Counties of SDG borders Quebec to the east and New York in the United States to the south. The sovereign Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne straddles both borders, thus including territory partly within Ontario, Quebec and New York.

==History==
The area along the Saint Lawrence River had been settled by indigenous peoples for thousands of years. About 2,000 years ago, the Point Peninsula complex people built earthen mounds, such as those at Serpent Mounds Park and Cameron&#x27;s Point. They were gradually replaced about 1000–1300 AD by the Owasco people, who had migrated northward. They practised a more settled form of agriculture.

These people are believed to have developed into the Iroquoian-speaking people, of which the St. Lawrence Iroquoians are identified as having settled along the river valley of the same name. They spoke Laurentian, practised agriculture, and built fortified villages, such as those visited and described by explorer Jacques Cartier. They were a group distinct from the Iroquois Five Nations based in present-day New York. Historians believe the Mohawk Iroquois pushed out or destroyed the St. Lawrence Iroquoians by 1600 and used the uninhabited territory as a hunting and trapping ground. In the 17th and early 18th century, some settled at Kahnawake, south of Montreal.

In the late 1750s, some 30 Mohawk families who had converted to Christianity, who had previously lived at Kahnawake, founded Akwesasne further West (upriver) in what would become Ontario. As of 2019, Akwesasne was the largest Mohawk territory in Canada, with a population of about 12,000 people.

Though accounts suggest Europeans filtered into the area and had lived in poorly documented, unofficial and widely scattered settlements for some time, the first formally documented European settlement was established in 1784 by United Empire Loyalists, primarily from the former British colony of New York. After the war for American independence, former colonial soldiers loyal to the Crown and other disbanded soldiers and their families began to settle at the site of Cornwall, then called New Johnstown. Many of the new arrivals were of German origin, with the town being named for Johnstown, New York where many came from.

The main group were led by Lieutenant-Colonel Sir John Johnson and were soldiers from the First Battalion King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York and a contingent of the 84th Royal Highland Emigrants. Following the success of rebellious colonists in the American Revolution, many of those afraid for their lives or uncomfortable in the newly independent United States would become &quot;United Empire Loyalists&quot;, as they were later called, and migrated to Canada. The British government helped them settle throughout the Canadas as a reward for their loyalty and to compensate them for their losses in the United States. One of the chief settlement regions was the St Lawrence River valley, from Kingston to Cornwall, which would later be known as &quot;loyalist country&quot;.

They founded a settlement on the site formerly called &quot;Pointe Maligne&quot; by French colonists and renamed it &quot;Royal Settlement #2&quot;, and, later, &quot;New Johnstown&quot;. It was later renamed Cornwall by the British for the Duke of Cornwall by proclamation of Prince George, and in 1834 the town became one of the first incorporated municipalities in the British colony of Upper Canada. The construction of the Cornwall Canal between 1834 and 1842 accelerated the community&#x27;s development into a regional and industrial economic &quot;capital&quot; for a growing hinterland of towns and villages.

The united counties comprises six of the original eight Royal Townships of Upper Canada: Lancaster, Charlottenburgh, Cornwall, Osnabruck, Williamsburgh and Matilda. These six townships were divided into 12 a few years after their creation. Each set of four townships became one of three separate counties: Lancaster, Charlottenburgh, Kenyon and Lochiel became Glengarry County, Cornwall, Osnabruck, Finch and Roxborough became Stormont County, and Williamsburgh, Matilda, Winchester and Mountain became Dundas County. The three counties were later amalgamated to form the United Counties of Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry.

In 1846, the population of Cornwall was about 1,600 and there were many brick and stone houses as well as a stone courthouse and jail, but the surrounding region contained a large number of towns that had grown from what were, originally, quite isolated settlements. Several government offices were located in Cornwall, but there was little industry, except for a foundry and two tanneries. However, many independent tradesmen of various types worked in the &quot;city&quot; and in the surrounding counties. Other town-based amenities in Cornwall included two bank agencies, eight taverns and a ladies&#x27; school. 
Canal and lock construction in the late 1800s and early 1900s brought work and international business. Railway connections, beginning in the 1850s, provided connections between Cornwall and local communities in the counties that required access to public services in Cornwall itself, such as high schools and medical services, and helped cement Cornwall&#x27;s position as a regional centre for a large, rapidly expanding and increasingly populated rural hinterland . The network of villages and towns surrounding Cornwall helped make the city a local entrepot for business, commerce, media and services, and the development of communication and travel networks turned what was originally a series of isolated towns into a cohesive economic and social region.

Situated on the southern border of the counties along the St. Lawrence River, west of Cornwall, were several smaller communities that no longer exist. Now known as the Lost Villages, the communities were permanently flooded in 1958 during the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway as the massive Moses-Saunders Power Dam at the western end of the city required a reservoir. The villages were flooded when it was filled. Much of the Cornwall region&#x27;s local character also changed at this time.

===Ethnic history===
Despite being a rural area, the United Counties have had a remarkably complex cultural history. Because of the usefulness of the St Lawrence river valley for transportation and the region&#x27;s general fertility and access to water, the river basin is a natural corridor for people and goods, migration and conquest, and many groups who have traveled through have also settled there.

Prior to European colonization, the Mohawks and Six Nations Iroquois settled, raided and battled through the St. Lawrence valley. The French and British fought over the waterway, often both using and being used by native allies in highly complex economic and political competition. During the War of 1812, a generation after thirteen of the British colonies declared independence and became the United States, the region became a battleground between Americans and the people who would become today&#x27;s Canadians. Formally founded under colonial British control to be a new home for refugees from the American Revolution, it remained a home for refugees and migrants for much of its history.

Early settlement of the region is largely undocumented, although oral histories and early accounts suggest that European settlers, traders and farmers lived in the area long before formal state recognition, and had been interacting with and/or mixing with the native population for most of that time.

The post-contact regional population was a mixture of French Canadian, Ojibwe and Mohawk residents. To this mix was added an influx of American English Loyalists and refugees from the Thirteen Colonies (now the United States), other French Canadian and Acadian migrants and, later, poor Scottish and Irish immigrants and refugees who arrived from overseas and from other parts of Canada. These different groups mixed and integrated over time, with family names and histories reflecting a blending of different backgrounds that became typical of Eastern Ontario.

Smaller but nevertheless impressive contributions in the region were made by a host of other migrants, from Jewish traders, craftsmen and merchants, to Eastern European refugees and even a significant body of former slaves. Many of these stories go unreported in standard histories, which pass over the remarkable history of migration in the region. One good example is the story of John Baker who died in Cornwall in 1871 at the age of 93. Born in Lower Canada, he was said to be the last Canadian born into slavery, and had been an active soldier in the War of 1812, fighting in both Canada and Europe. Slavery was ended in the colony of Upper Canada in stages, beginning in 1793 when importing slaves was banned, and culminating in 1819 when Upper Canada Attorney-General John Robinson declared all slaves in the colony to be freed, making Upper Canada the first place in the British Empire - and, in fact, the world - to unequivocally move towards formal abolition of chattel slavery. Most of these former slaves settled and integrated into the same communities where they were freed. By 1833, this process of liberation had succeeded throughout the Empire and all slaves in the British Empire were free. The British Empire was the first major state in world history to abolish slavery, and Ontario was the place where this process first bore fruit. John Baker, the last slave to be born into slavery in Canada, died in Cornwall.

&quot;Canada&quot; had been stripped from France after the Seven Years&#x27; War, and this included roughly the areas now covered by the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. In the aftermath of the American Revolution, the British authorities split the Province of Canada in 1791 into two, Upper Canada for English settlers fleeing persecution in the United States and Lower Canada for the French (later, Ontario and Quebec, respectively). This was designed to accommodate Loyalists who had fled post-war reprisals and persecution in the new United States, though the 5,000 English-speaking settlers in the Eastern Township of Quebec were allowed to stay in the French-speaking area and many French settlers moved into Ontario, especially into Eastern Ontario. Along with the area&#x27;s original inhabitants, this made the area a patchwork of intersecting ethnicities that would ultimately end up blending.

Cornwall and the surrounding area, originally called &quot;Royal Settlement #2&quot; and then &quot;New Jamestown&quot;, was initially a rough place, and was largely left to its own devices by all levels of government. According to contemporaneous reports, this bred a local culture of intense self-reliance. Adding to this initial history of pragmatic entrepreneurialism, beginning very early with the founding of the city, provincial and federal governments have typically neglected the area, treating it as little more than a transit corridor, an attitude which reached its apogee when the St. Lawrence Seaway was smashed through the region in the late 1950s, allowing the Canadian and American national economies to permanently bypass the region, leaving it once again to become something of an economic backwater. From the beginning to the present day, those who remained in the region tended to be those who had the fortitude and energy to survive on their own, with little useful outside assistance.

The original 516 settlers arrived in Royal Township #2 with minimal supplies and faced years of hard work and possible starvation. Upon their departure from military camps in Montreal, Pointe Claire, Saint Anne, and Lachine in the fall of 1784, Loyalists were given a tent, one month&#x27;s worth of food rations, clothes, and agricultural provisions by regiment commanders. They were promised one cow for every two families, an axe, and other necessary tools in the near future. For the next three years, bateaux (boat) crews delivered rations to the township, after which residents were left to fend for themselves.

The region&#x27;s energetic spirit of enterprise and fortitude was well known in the 19th century. David Thompson, the Welsh-Canadian explorer who mapped the Far West and was called the greatest land geographer in history, drew many of his traveling companions from Cornwall&#x27;s rural hinterland, drawing on Scottish and native settlers, and himself lived in Williamstown.

More recently, Cornwall has seen an increase in the arrival of new immigrants, who tend to integrate and often fare better than immigrants in other parts of the country.

<text>The European Parliamentary Elections Act 1999 (c. 1) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Act amended the procedures on European elections in the United Kingdom. It received Royal Assent on 14 January 1999, after the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 had been invoked, as the House of Lords had rejected the bill six times, refusing to accept the change in the electoral system proposed. The Parliament Acts are rarely invoked; the European Parliamentary Elections Act was only the fifth statute since 1911 enacted under their provisions, and only the second since the Parliament Act 1949.

It was passed mainly to change the electoral system used for electing Member of the European Parliament (MEP)s from first past the post to a closed party list system in England, Scotland and Wales. The single transferable vote system was retained in Northern Ireland. The UK was divided into twelve electoral regions, nine in England (matching the regions of England) and one in Scotland, one in Wales and one in Northern Ireland.

The act led to a significant increase in the number of MEPs being returned from minor parties in the 1999 European elections, with more Liberal Democrats, along with the first European representatives for Plaid Cymru and the first national representatives for both the Green Party and the UK Independence Party.

The act was repealed by the European Parliamentary Elections Act 2002.

<text>In mathematics, a double Mersenne number is a Mersenne number of the form

:formula_1

where &quot;p&quot; is prime.

== Examples ==
The first four terms of the sequence of double Mersenne numbers are :
:formula_2
:formula_3
:formula_4
:formula_5

== Double Mersenne primes ==
A double Mersenne number that is prime is called a double Mersenne prime. Since a Mersenne number &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; can be prime only if &quot;p&quot; is prime, (see Mersenne prime for a proof), a double Mersenne number formula_6 can be prime only if &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is itself a Mersenne prime. For the first values of &quot;p&quot; for which &quot;M&quot;&quot;p&quot; is prime, formula_7 is known to be prime for &quot;p&quot; = 2, 3, 5, 7 while explicit factors of formula_7 have been found for &quot;p&quot; = 13, 17, 19, and 31.

Thus, the smallest candidate for the next double Mersenne prime is formula_9, or 22305843009213693951 − 1.
Being approximately 1.695,
this number is far too large for any currently known primality test. It has no prime factor below 1 × 1036.
There are probably no other double Mersenne primes than the four known.

Smallest prime factor of formula_7 (where &quot;p&quot; is the &quot;n&quot;th prime) are

:7, 127, 2147483647, 170141183460469231731687303715884105727, 47, 338193759479, 231733529, 62914441, 2351, 1399, 295257526626031, 18287, 106937, 863, 4703, 138863, 22590223644617, ... (next term is &gt; 1 × 1036) 

==Catalan–Mersenne number conjecture==

The recursively defined sequence
: formula_11
: formula_12
is called the sequence of Catalan–Mersenne numbers. The first terms of the sequence are: 
:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17
:formula_18
Catalan discovered this sequence after the discovery of the primality of formula_19 by Lucas in 1876. Catalan conjectured that they are prime &quot;up to a certain limit&quot;. Although the first five terms are prime, no known methods can prove that any further terms are prime (in any reasonable time) simply because they are too huge. However, if formula_20 is not prime, there is a chance to discover this by computing formula_20 modulo some small prime formula_22 (using recursive modular exponentiation). If the resulting residue is zero, formula_22 represents a factor of formula_20 and thus would disprove its primality. Since formula_20 is a Mersenne number, such a prime factor formula_22 would have to be of the form formula_27. Additionally, because formula_28 is composite when formula_29 is composite, the discovery of a composite term in the sequence would preclude the possibility of any further primes in the sequence.

If formula_20 were prime, it would also contradict the New Mersenne conjecture. It is known that formula_31 is composite, with factor formula_32.

==In popular culture==
In the Futurama movie , the double Mersenne number formula_33 is briefly seen in &quot;an elementary proof of the Goldbach conjecture&quot;. In the movie, this number is known as a &quot;Martian prime&quot;.

<text>The International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) is the largest conference for the topic of mathematics. It meets once every four years, hosted by the International Mathematical Union (IMU).

The Fields Medals, the IMU Abacus Medal (known before 2022 as the Nevanlinna Prize), the Gauss Prize, and the Chern Medal are awarded during the congress&#x27;s opening ceremony. Each congress is memorialized by a printed set of Proceedings recording academic papers based on invited talks intended to be relevant to current topics of general interest. Being invited to talk at the ICM has been called &quot;the equivalent ... of an induction to a hall of fame&quot;.

==History==


German mathematicians Felix Klein and Georg Cantor are credited with putting forward the idea of an international congress of mathematicians in the 1890s. 

The University of Chicago, which had opened in 1892, organized an International Mathematical Congress at the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair in 1893, where Felix Klein participated as the official German representative.

The first official International Congress of Mathematicians was held in Zürich in August 1897. The organizers included such prominent mathematicians as Luigi Cremona, Felix Klein, Gösta Mittag-Leffler, Andrey Markov, and others. The congress was attended by 208 mathematicians from 16 countries, 
including more than 100 from Switzerland or Germany, 
around 20 from each of France, Italy, and Austria-Hungary, 
13 from the Russian Empire and 7 from the US. Only four were women: Iginia Massarini, , Charlotte Scott, and Charlotte Wedell.

During the 1900 congress in Paris, France, David Hilbert announced his famous list of 23 unsolved mathematical problems, now termed Hilbert&#x27;s problems. Moritz Cantor and Vito Volterra gave the two plenary lectures at the start of the congress.

At the 1904 ICM Gyula Kőnig delivered a lecture where he claimed that Georg Cantor&#x27;s famous continuum hypothesis was false. An error in Kőnig&#x27;s proof was discovered by Ernst Zermelo soon thereafter. Kőnig&#x27;s announcement at the congress caused considerable uproar, and Klein had to personally explain to the Grand Duke of Baden (who was a financial sponsor of the congress) what could cause such an unrest among mathematicians.

During the 1912 congress in Cambridge, England, Edmund Landau listed four basic problems about prime numbers, now called Landau&#x27;s problems. The 1924 congress in Toronto was organized by John Charles Fields, initiator of the Fields Medal; it included a roundtrip railway excursion to Vancouver and ferry to Victoria. The first two Fields Medals were awarded at the 1936 ICM in Oslo.

In the aftermath of World War I, at the insistence of the Allied Powers, the 1920 ICM in Strasbourg and the 1924 ICM in Toronto excluded mathematicians from the countries formerly part of the Central Powers. This resulted in a still unresolved controversy as to whether to count the Strasbourg and Toronto congresses as true ICMs. At the opening of the 1932 ICM in Zürich, Hermann Weyl said: &quot;We attend here to an extraordinary improbable event. For the number of &quot;n&quot;, corresponding to the just opened International Congress of Mathematicians, we have the inequality 7 ≤ &quot;n&quot; ≤ 9; unfortunately our axiomatic foundations are not sufficient to give a more precise statement”. As a consequence of this controversy, from the 1932 Zürich congress onward, the ICMs are not numbered.

For the 1950 ICM in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Laurent Schwartz, one of the Fields Medalists for that year, and Jacques Hadamard, both of whom were viewed by the U.S. authorities as communist sympathizers, were only able to obtain U.S. visas after the personal intervention of President Harry Truman.

The first woman to give an ICM plenary lecture, at the 1932 congress in Zürich, was Emmy Noether. The second ICM plenary talk by a woman was delivered 58 years later, at the 1990 ICM in Kyoto, by Karen Uhlenbeck.

The 1998 congress was attended by 3,346 participants. The American Mathematical Society reported that more than 4,500 participants attended the 2006 conference in Madrid, Spain. The King of Spain presided over the 2006 conference opening ceremony. The 2010 Congress took place in Hyderabad, India, on August 19–27, 2010. The ICM 2014 was held in Seoul, South Korea, on August 13–21, 2014. The 2018 Congress took place in Rio de Janeiro on August 1–9, 2018.

===ICMs and the International Mathematical Union===

The organizing committees of the early ICMs were formed in large part on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; basis and there was no single body continuously overseeing the ICMs. 
Following the end of World War I, the Allied Powers established in 1919 in Brussels the International Research Council (IRC). At the IRC&#x27;s instructions, in 1920 the &quot;Union Mathematique Internationale&quot; (UMI) was created. This was the immediate predecessor of the current International Mathematical Union. Under the IRC&#x27;s pressure, UMI reassigned the 1920 congress from Stockholm to Strasbourg and insisted on the rule which excluded from the congress mathematicians representing the former Central Powers. The exclusion rule, which also applied to the 1924 ICM, turned out to be quite unpopular among mathematicians from the U.S. and Great Britain. The 1924 ICM was originally scheduled to be held in New York, but had to be moved to Toronto after the American Mathematical Society withdrew its invitation to host the congress, in protest against the exclusion rule. As a result of the exclusion rule and the protests it generated, the 1920 and the 1924 ICMs were considerably smaller than the previous ones. In the run-up to the 1928 ICM in Bologna, IRC and UMI still insisted on applying the exclusion rule. In the face of the protests against the exclusion rule and the possibility of a boycott of the congress by the American Mathematical Society and the London Mathematical Society, the congress&#x27;s organizers decided to hold the 1928 ICM under the auspices of the University of Bologna rather than of the UMI. The 1928 congress and all the subsequent congresses have been open for participation by mathematicians of all countries. 
The statutes of the UMI expired in 1931 and at the 1932 ICM in Zürich a decision to dissolve the UMI was made, largely in opposition to IRC&#x27;s pressure on the UMI.

At the 1950 ICM the participants voted to reconstitute the International Mathematical Union (IMU), which was formally established in 1951. Starting with the 1954 congress in Amsterdam, the ICMs are held under the auspices of the IMU.

===Soviet participation===

The Soviet Union sent 27 participants to the 1928 ICM in Bologna and 10 participants to the 1932 ICM in Zürich. No Soviet mathematicians participated in the 1936 ICM, although a number of invitations were extended to them. At the 1950 ICM there were again no participants from the Soviet Union, although quite a few were invited. Similarly, no representatives of other Eastern Bloc countries, except for Yugoslavia, participated in the 1950 congress. Andrey Kolmogorov had been appointed to the Fields Medal selection committee for the 1950 congress, but did not participate in the committee&#x27;s work. However, in a famous episode, a few days before the end of the 1950 ICM, the congress&#x27; organizers received a telegram from Sergei Vavilov, President of the USSR Academy of Sciences. The telegram thanked the organizers for inviting Soviet mathematicians but said that they are unable to attend &quot;being very much occupied with their regular work&quot;, and wished success to the congress&#x27;s participants. Vavilov&#x27;s message was seen as a hopeful sign for the future ICMs and the situation improved further after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in 1953. The Soviet Union was represented by five mathematicians at the 1954 ICM in Amsterdam, and several other Eastern Bloc countries sent their representatives as well. In 1957 the USSR joined the International Mathematical Union and the participation in subsequent ICMs by the Soviet and other Eastern Bloc scientists returned to more normal levels. However, even after 1957, tensions between ICM organizers and the Soviet side persisted. Soviet mathematicians invited to attend the ICMs routinely experienced difficulties with obtaining exit visas from the Soviet Union and were often unable to come. Thus of the 41 invited speakers from the USSR for the 1974 ICM in Vancouver, only 20 actually arrived. Grigory Margulis, who was awarded the Fields Medal at 1978 ICM in Helsinki, was not granted an exit visa and was unable to attend the 1978 congress. Another, related, point of contention was the jurisdiction over Fields Medals for Soviet mathematicians. After 1978 the Soviet Union put forward a demand that the USSR Academy of Sciences approve all Soviet candidates for the Fields Medal, before it was awarded to them. However, the IMU insisted that the decisions regarding invited speakers and Fields medalists be kept under exclusive jurisdiction of the ICM committees appointed for that purpose by the IMU.

<text>Pablo Cottenot (born 1800) was a 19th-century French astronomer and discoverer of a minor planet.

He worked at Marseille Observatory, but according to Édouard Stephan, Cottenot&#x27;s astronomy career was brief. He is credited by the Minor Planet Center with the discovery of one minor planet, the outer main-belt asteroid 181 Eucharis, which he named for a nymph of the goddess Calypso.

<text>The Strelitziaceae comprise a family of monocotyledonous flowering plants, very similar in appearance and growth habit to members of the related families Heliconiaceae and Musaceae (banana family). The three genera with seven species of Strelitziaceae have been included in Musaceae in some classifications, but are generally recognized as a separate family in more recent treatments such as the APG II system (2003). The APG II system assigns the Strelitziaceae to the order Zingiberales in the commelinid clade.

== Taxonomy ==
The Strelitziaceae include three genera, all occurring in tropical to subtropical regions: &quot;Strelitzia&quot; with five species in southern Africa, &quot;Ravenala&quot; with a single species in Madagascar, and &quot;Phenakospermum&quot; with a single species in northern South America. The best-known species is the bird-of-paradise flower &quot;Strelitzia reginae&quot;, grown for its flowers worldwide in tropical and subtropical gardens, and a well-known flower in floristry. The other species of &quot;Strelitzia&quot; have less colourful flowers and are grown instead for their striking foliage. Also grown for its foliage is the traveller&#x27;s tree, &quot;Ravenala madagascariensis&quot;.

<text>Spyridon Marinatos (; – 1 October 1974) was a Greek archaeologist who specialised in the Bronze Age Minoan and Mycenaean civilizations. He is best known for the excavation of the Minoan site of Akrotiri on Santorini, which he conducted between 1967 and 1974. A recipient of several honours in Greece and abroad, he was considered one of the most important Greek archaeologists of his day.

A native of Kephallonia, Marinatos was educated at the University of Athens, at the Humboldt University of Berlin and at the University of Halle. His early teachers included noted archaeologists such as Panagiotis Kavvadias, Christos Tsountas and Georg Karo. He joined the Greek Archaeological Service in 1919, and spent much of his early career on the island of Crete, where he excavated several Minoan sites, served as director of the Heraklion Museum, and formulated his theory that the collapse of Neopalatial Minoan society had been the result of the eruption of the volcanic island of Santorini around 1600 BCE.

In the 1940s and 1950s, Marinatos surveyed and excavated widely in the region of Messenia in southwest Greece, collaborating with Carl Blegen, who was engaged in the simultaneous excavation of the Palace of Nestor at Pylos. He also discovered and excavated the battlefield of Thermopylae and the Mycenaean cemeteries at Tsepi and near Marathon in Attica.

Marinatos served three times as head of the Greek Archaeological Service, firstly between 1937 and 1939, secondly between 1955 and 1958, and finally under the military junta which ruled Greece between 1967 and 1974. In the late 1930s, he was close to the quasi-fascist dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, under whom he initiated legislation to restrict the roles of women in Greek archaeology, and he was later an enthusiastic supporter of the junta. His leadership of the Archaeological Service has been criticised for its cronyism and for promoting the pursuit of grand discoveries at the expense of good scholarship. Marinatos died while excavating at Akrotiri in 1974, and is buried at the site.

== Life ==

=== Early career and education ===
Spyridon Marinatos was born in Lixouri on the Ionian island of Kephallonia on . His father, Nikolaos, was a carpenter. Marinatos studied at the University of Athens from 1916, where he competed unsuccessfully with Christos Karouzos for a scholarship, beginning a lifelong rivalry between the two. Marinatos joined the Greek Archaeological Service in 1919 and was first posted to Crete as an (junior archaeological official). His early excavations on Crete included the Minoan villa at Amnisos, and he continued to excavate on the island periodically between 1919 and 1952. 

Marinatos was one of the first thirty-six students of the &quot;Practical School of Art History&quot;, an archaeological training centre established by the Archaeological Society of Athens at the request of the Greek government, studying there in the 1919–1920 academic year. The school&#x27;s instructors included noted archaeologists and folklorists such as Panagiotis Kavvadias, Christos Tsountas, , Antonios Keramopoulos and , while his fellow students included Karouzos and Semni Papaspyridi, later Karouzos&#x27;s wife. Between 1921 and 1925, Marinatos completed military service in the Hellenic Army. He received his doctorate in 1925, with a dissertation supervised by the archaeologist on the depiction of marine animals in Minoan art.

In June 1926, Marinatos met the British archaeologist Arthur Evans at the site of the Minoan palace at Knossos, which Evans had been excavating since 1900: both had travelled to the site to assess the damage of an earthquake. Evans would become an influence on his theories of contact between Minoan Crete and ancient Egypt, and on his study of natural disasters in prehistory. Marinatos and Evans quarrelled in 1928–1929, when he challenged Evans over a trial excavation that the latter had initiated at Knossos without a permit, but Marinatos subsequently became Evans&#x27;s long-term friend and intellectual supporter. In 1930, inspired by Evans, he gave a lecture in which he argued that the destruction of the site of Knossos had been caused by an earthquake. Other sites Marinatos excavated on Crete included Messara, Sklavokampos, the Geometric temple at Dreros, Tylissos and Eileithyia Cave. 

As was common practice for Greek archaeologists at the time, Marinatos studied in Germany; he attended the Humboldt University of Berlin and the University of Halle. He arrived at Berlin in 1927, where his teachers included the philologist Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and the archaeologist . He attended Halle on a scholarship, which he won in 1928 while serving as deputy to , the senior ephor (archaeological inspector) of eastern Crete. At Halle, he studied under Georg Karo, who had excavated at the Mycenaean site of Tiryns and was working on the publication of the finds from Heinrich Schliemann&#x27;s excavations at Mycenae. Xanthoudidis died suddenly in 1929; Marinatos returned early from Halle to succeed him, and was appointed as senior ephor of eastern Crete in March 1929. He served as director of the Heraklion Museum from 1929 until 1937. He considered his monthly salary of 3,500 drachmas inadequate, and told a Cretan newspaper that he was considering leaving archaeology over it.

During his time on Crete, Marinatos was credited with thwarting the efforts of local goldsmiths to produce and sell forged antiquities, which were commissioned by antiquities traders. He also successfully prosecuted Nikolaos Pollakis, a Cretan priest, in 1931 for illegal antiquities trading. He excavated at Arkalochori Cave in central Crete in 1934–1935, assisted by the Nikolaos Platon, where he uncovered the Arkalochori Axe. Between 1934 and 1935, Marinatos excavated a Mycenaean cemetery on his native island of Kephallonia, where he discovered two chamber tombs. The project was funded by Johanna Goekoop, the widow of the Dutch businessman and amateur archaeologist Adriaan Goekoop, who had paid for excavations by Marinatos&#x27;s former teacher Kavvadias on the island in 1899.

=== First directorship of the Archaeological Service ===
Marinatos served as Director General of Antiquities and Historic Monuments, the head of the Greek Archaeological Service, from 1937 until 1939, succeeding Georgios Oikonomos, who moved to the more prestigious office of Director General of Antiquities, Letters and Arts. Shortly after his promotion, Marinatos left Crete to become a professor at the University of Athens, where he introduced the first teaching of Near Eastern archaeology. His students at Athens included the archaeologists , Stylianos Alexiou and Evi Touloupa.

In 1939, Marinatos undertook a lecture tour of the United States. His former teacher Karo, who had fled there from antisemitic persecution in Germany, asked Marinatos to forward on his behalf a series of postcards from Greece to various addresses in Nazi-occupied Europe. Unsure of Karo&#x27;s intentions, Marinatos gave the letters to his benefactor Elizabeth Humlin Hunt, in whose home he had been staying, to dispose of: she handed them to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. This began a chain of allegations against Karo which, while ultimately dismissed as unproven, saw him labelled an &quot;enemy alien&quot; and denied US citizenship. When a joint excavation between the University of Cincinnati, represented by Carl Blegen, and the Greek Archaeological Service under Kourouniotis discovered in 1939 the remains of the Mycenaean palace at Pylos, Marinatos played an important role in facilitating the purchase of the site and in popularising its identification as the &quot;Palace of Nestor&quot;.

In May 1939, funded and assisted by Elizabeth Humlin Hunt, Marinatos discovered and excavated the battlefield of Thermopylae, the site of the last stand of the Spartans against the Persian Empire in 480 BCE. His excavation was widely reported in the Greek and foreign press, and played an important ideological role for the nationalist government of Ioannis Metaxas. In the same year, Marinatos published an article in the journal &quot;Antiquity&quot; arguing that the Neopalatial civilisation of Crete had been destroyed by the eruption of the volcanic island of Thera, based on his discovery at Amnisos of a large quantity of volcanic pumice that had been worn away by water, which he took as evidence of tsunamis similar to those that followed the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa. Marinatos decided to excavate on Thera to test his hypothesis, though the initially muted scholarly reaction to his ideas led him to reconsider his intention to begin this work in 1939, and it was subsequently further delayed by the Second World War. Later, in 1950, he suggested that the story of Atlantis may derive from an oral tradition of myths concerning the eruption of Thera.

=== Second World War and aftermath ===
During the winter of 1940–1941, at which time Greece was under invasion from Italy, Marinatos collaborated with the British archaeologist Alan Wace to study the façade of the Treasury of Atreus, a late Bronze Age tomb at Mycenae. In 1945, he replaced Kourouniotis, who had died the same year, as the Greek representative in the excavations at Pylos. Blegen offered to collaborate with Marinatos on the excavation of the palace, but Marinatos opted instead to excavated sites in the wider area of Messenia, with the aim of finding hitherto-undiscovered Mycenaean cemeteries and settlements. His method of consulting local farmers and hunters about the location of surface finds allowed him to discover sites previously unknown to archaeology. 

Marinatos travelled to Italy, Germany and Austria on 1 May 1948, with the military rank of (major), to recover Greek antiquities looted during the Second World War. The trip lasted seventy-five days and was often frustrated by the non-cooperation of archaeologists, officials and soldiers from other Allied powers, but Marinatos succeeded in recovering the Aphrodite of Rhodes as well as objects looted from Knossos by the Nazi general Julius Ringel. In 1949–1951, he returned to Crete, excavating at Vathypetro. He returned to Messenia in 1952, representing the Archaeological Society of Athens, when he uncovered a wealthy cemetery at Volimidia, around to the north-east of the Palace of Nestor: he described this discovery as &quot;very encouraging&quot; and considered the tombs to belong to Homeric Pylos, ruled by the mythical Nestor. He excavated a total of thirty-one tombs at Volimidia in 1952–1954, 1960 and 1964–1965. 

Between 1956 and 1957, Marinatos excavated the second, unplundered, tomb at Routsi. Between 1960 and 1965, Marinatos excavated the tombs at Peristeria. Other sites he excavated in Messenia included Mouriatada, Katarrhaki and Palaiohoria – all in the area of Koukounara – Voroulia and the at Voidokilia known as the &quot;Tomb of Thrasymedes&quot;. In total, he produced thirty-five publications on the subject of Mycenaean Messenia. Working in Messenia until 1966, he discovered over twenty archaeological sites, including a monumental building with frescoes at Iklaina, a burial tumulus at Papoulia, and the tomb at Charakopeio. He built a house in Volimidia in the 1960s, which he owned until his death.

Marinatos briefly returned as director of the Archaeological Service in 1955, but was forced to resign in 1958 by the Prime Minister, Konstantinos Karamanlis, and was succeeded by John Papadimitriou. In late July 1960, he resigned from Greece&#x27;s Archaeological Council, which advised the Greek government on archaeological matters, in protest at the transfer of the Archaeological Service from the Ministry of Education to the Ministry of the Presidency, which was seen as a move to align it more closely with the state&#x27;s tourism policy and grant Papadimitriou greater autonomy. He served as rector of the University of Athens in 1958–1959, remaining as a professor there until 1968.

=== Regime of the Colonels, Akrotiri and death ===

Recalled to head the Archaeological Service by the recently installed military junta in 1967, Marinatos established an archaeological journal, the &quot;Athens Annals of Archaeology&quot;, and was credited with facilitating the resumption of the American excavations in the Athenian &quot;agora&quot; in 1969. He discovered the Mycenaean cemetery of Tsepi, near Marathon, excavating it personally between November 1969 and October 1970, and frequently returning to visit and direct the excavations over the succeeding years. At , near Tsepi, he excavated four prehistoric tumuli in 1970 on behalf of the Archaeological Society of Athens, and partially excavated a nearby classical tumulus known as the &quot;Tumulus of the Plataeans&quot;. Marinatos believed that this was the burial mound of the soldiers of Plataea who died during the Battle of Marathon in 490 BCE, but his identification has generally been rejected.

Marinatos&#x27;s most notable excavation was the site of Akrotiri, a Minoan settlement on the island of Thera whose existence had first been established in 1867. His decision to investigate the site followed Platon&#x27;s excavations of Zakros on Crete, which began in 1961 and uncovered pumice: Platon announced in the Greek press that this discovery was proof of Marinatos&#x27;s theory of the volcanic destruction of Minoan civilisation. Marinatos visited Thera in 1962 and 1963, and began excavations in 1967. He circumvented the difficulty of excavating the remains, which were buried beneath approximately of pumice, by tunnelling into the site from a gully that cut through it. The excavations were funded partly by the Archaeological Society of Athens, from whom Marinatos secured $2000 (), and partly by the naval engineer James W. Mavor, who collaborated on the excavation for its first year and supplied the same amount, which he had received as an advance for his collaboration on a book about Atlantis.

Within five days of the excavation&#x27;s start on 24 May, Marinatos uncovered remains of a structure in the Minoan architectural style, as well as pottery of Cretan origin. He was called back to Athens on official business and to commence the purchase of the land, and only able to return on 21 June, a week before the first season was due to conclude. The excavation was supported by forty local pumice miners, and uncovered the first traces of frescoes, over a total of six days of work across the season. Between 1971 and 1972, he excavated a structure he called the &quot;West House&quot;; the frescoes found there were called &quot;one of the most important monuments of Aegean art yet found&quot; by the archaeologist Peter Warren in 1979. By 1974, the excavated area totalled approximately .Marinatos was removed from the leadership of the Archaeological Service on 31 January 1974. No official reason was given for the dismissal, though the general Dimitrios Ioannidis, who had taken power in a coup of November 1973, considered him a potentially subversive &quot;liberal&quot;. On 1 October 1974, Marinatos died while excavating at Akrotiri. Contemporary accounts related that he had died from a fall, while giving instructions to a worker; a later narrative emerged that he had been struck by a collapsing wall. At the time of his death, most of his excavations were not fully published. He was initially buried on the excavation site, near the place of his death; his grave was subsequently moved outside the ruins. Marinatos&#x27;s deputy Christos Doumas, who had worked with him at Akrotiri since 1968, took over the site and published the first full report of its excavation in 1983.

== Politics ==
Marinatos held strong right-wing and Greek nationalist views. In the late 1920s, he was a supporter of Eleftherios Venizelos, a broadly liberal politician who had brought Greece into the First World War on the side of the Entente. In a letter of 1928, he described his fellow Greek archaeologists as &quot;Bolsheviks or social reformers of no international recognition&quot;; in 1949, he visited the concentration camp of Makronisos, used to imprison communists during the Greek Civil War, and wrote that there was &quot;no finer school&quot; in Greece. The archaeological historian Andreas Vlachopoulos has judged that Marinatos&#x27;s politics rarely influenced his work, but that he made &quot;nationalist exaggerations in favour of the Greek race&quot; during his excavations around Marathon. During the quasi-fascist dictatorship of Ioannis Metaxas, which began in August 1936, Marinatos and the Athenian intellectual establishment enjoyed official support: Metaxas had previously visited Marinatos at archaeological excavations, and attended a lecture by him on 13 March 1940. Marinatos was invited by the Nazi government of Germany to speak at the Sixth International Conference of Classical Archaeology, held in Berlin between 21 and 26 August 1939, as a representative of the Metaxas administration. The conference has been described by the archaeological historian Georgia Flouda as &quot;a propaganda venue&quot; for German archaeology. In the late 1960s, Marinatos served on a fundraising committee to raise a monument to Metaxas in Argostoli on Kephallonia.

In 1939, Marinatos initiated legislation which banned women from joining the Archaeological Service or serving as the directors of museums and regional ephorates, as part of a broader scheme of misogynistic legislation promoted by the Metaxas government. In a public address of 28 October 1941, commemorating Metaxas&#x27;s defiance of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini the previous year, Marinatos praised both Metaxas, who had died that January, and the exiled George II, who had made Metaxas prime minister after his own restoration in a military coup led by Georgios Kondylis. Despite the ongoing Axis occupation of Greece, his comments were broadcast on national radio and garnered a strong reaction from the Greek public: the historian and communist Yanis Kordatos denounced Marinatos in , the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Greece, and Karouzos and Yannis Miliadis wrote to the collaborationist Prime Minister, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, criticising Marinatos&#x27;s conduct.

When the military junta known as the &quot;Regime of the Colonels&quot; seized power in 1967, they dismissed the director of the Archaeological Service, Ioannis Kontis, considering him politically unreliable. Marinatos, described in a modern study as &quot;utterly devoted&quot; to the regime, was immediately reappointed to replace him, under the title of &quot;Inspector General of the Services of Archaeology and Restoration&quot;. According to Doumas, Marinatos&#x27;s support was an important factor in the legitimisation of the junta&#x27;s rule. Marinatos promoted his own supporters and oversaw the sacking of many Greek archaeologists, making particular efforts to remove his political opponents, women – particularly Semni Karouzou, who was forced into exile in Italy and Germany – and adherents of progressive, non-traditional methodology. According to his daughter Nanno, he became disillusioned with politics in the last year of his life, particularly following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in July 1974, and wrote in a letter that he was &quot;a citizen of Minos and live[d] in 1500 BCE&quot;.

== Assessment and legacy ==

Until 1974, Marinatos and his followers were considered a dominant force in the Greek archaeological establishment. An Athens newspaper reported his death with the headline &quot;the oak tree of archaeology has fallen&quot;. In 2021, the archaeologist Jack Davis called Marinatos one of the great figures of Greek archaeology. He was listed in 2015 as &quot;belong[ing] to a special archaeological generation that renewed Greek archaeology&quot; by the archaeological historian .

The excavation of Akrotiri was recognised within Marinatos&#x27;s lifetime as his most significant contribution to scholarship. Shortly before Marinatos&#x27;s death, the British archaeologist Reynold Higgins noted that the excavations at Akrotiri had been called &quot;the most important classical excavation since Pompeii&quot;; they were covered by media from Europe, the United States, Australia, Iran, Japan, and China, and prompted a special edition of &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine in 1978. The site is known as one of the best-preserved settlements from the ancient world, and is particularly important in the study of Minoan art, especially wall-painting.

Several of Marinatos&#x27;s archaeological hypotheses were controversial in his time and have since been rejected. The editors of &quot;Antiquity&quot; appended a postscript to his 1939 publication about the Thera eruption, stating that they believed the evidence currently insufficient to support Marinatos&#x27;s hypothesis that the eruption had destroyed Minoan civilisation. Contemporary excavators on Crete found little supporting evidence for it, and it attracted few adherents until Platon&#x27;s work at Zakros in the early 1960s. In the later part of the twentieth century, more detailed analysis of the pottery from both Crete and Akrotiri indicated that the eruption occurred several generations before the end of Neopalatial civilisation, and the latter is now generally attributed to human causes. The story of Atlantis is generally considered to be an &quot;invented myth&quot; by the Athenian philosopher Plato, rather than a genuine oral tradition, and most modern scholars consider the attempt to link archaeological finds to the characters and places of the Homeric poems, as Marinatos did for Pylos, Volimidia and Voidokilia, to be fundamentally misguided. 

Marinatos&#x27;s leadership has been characterised as promoting himself and the pursuit of impressive finds at the expense of scholarship. During his third period as the head of the Archaeological Service, he was criticised for his abolition of the rigorous examination process by which new ephors were selected, and his approach to recruiting and promoting colleagues has been described as driven by cronyism and political manoeuvring. His colleague at the University of Athens, Nikolaos Kontoleon, wrote that Marinatos&#x27;s administration &quot;constituted an unprecedented attempt to curtail the scholarly activity of Greek archaeologists... [and] exercised oppression [which] dismembered a whole service&quot;. According to the archaeological historians Dimitra Kokkinidou and Mariana Nikolaidou, his management had &quot;a disastrous impact on future developments&quot;, as his methods and priorities were adapted by his successors after the return to democracy in 1974.

== Personal life, honours and character ==
Marinatos generally affected to excavate in a pith helmet. His house, which he used as a classroom during the German occupation of Athens of 1941–1944, was designed in the style of Minoan architecture. He had interests in medicine, astronomy, botany and biology, which informed his archaeological work. The archaeologist Emily Vermeule, who excavated with Marinatos at Akrotiri, called him a &quot;crack revolver shot, diplomat, astronomer, linguist, and portly wit&quot;. His former student Stylianos Alexiou later recalled listening to Marinatos play classical music on the violin. He may also have written a novel. 

Marinatos was known to be strong-willed and sometimes stern. His former student, the archaeologist Yannos Lolos, described him as &quot;an archaeologist in the grand tradition&quot;, &quot;an austere and imposing figure&quot; and as a gifted speaker, &quot;restless and indefatigable as an excavator&quot;. Marinatos&#x27;s colleague Yannis Miliadis, however, wrote in 1937 that he had &quot;good intentions, up to the point that they [were] confronted with his personal interests&quot;. During his quarrel with Evans in the late 1920s, archaeologists of the British School at Athens, particularly John Pendlebury, accused Marinatos of being &quot;German-minded&quot; and of anti-British prejudice, a claim that Nanno Marinatos has condemned as unfounded. 

Between 1925 and June 1974, Marinatos maintained a scrapbook of his appearances in the academic and popular press, which eventually grew to around four hundred pages. He cultivated relationships with newspaper editors, such as Miltiadis Paraskevaïdis and Athina Kalogeropoulou (also an archaeologist): he frequently invited Paraskevaïdis to his home at 47 Polyla Street in Athens to give him interviews and photographs for publication. He maintained a particular association with the newspapers and , publishing articles in the former between 1928 and 1961 and in the latter from the 1950s until its closure in 1967. 

Marinatos was made a member of the Academy of Athens, Greece&#x27;s national academy, in 1955, and was its president at the time of his death. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1966. He was also a doctor of the University of Palermo, as well as an honorary member of the Archaeological Institute of America, of the German Archaeological Institute and of the . He held a visiting membership at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, as well as memberships of the British Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies and the Spanish . He was a corresponding member of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts, the and the British Academy. He was made a commander of the Order of the Phoenix, a knight of the Order of George I, and in 1938 an officer of the French Legion of Honour. He was also awarded the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, Italy&#x27;s most senior honour.

Marinatos maintained a long-running collaboration with the conservator Zacharias Kanakis, who worked with him on excavations between 1934 and 1970. Marinatos was married twice, to Maria Evangelidou in 1927 and, at the time of his death, to Emily Loverdos. His daughter by Loverdos, Nanno Marinatos, is also a scholar of Minoan culture. After the elder Marinatos&#x27;s death, a bronze bust of him was erected in the garden of the Archaeological Museum of Chora, which holds many finds from his excavations in Messenia; one of the town&#x27;s major streets is also named after him.

<text>Coral Castle is an oolite limestone structure created by the Latvian-American eccentric Edward Leedskalnin (1887–1951). It comprises numerous large stones, each weighing several tons, sculpted into a variety of shapes, including slab walls, tables, chairs, a crescent moon, a water fountain and a sundial. It was sold to Lennar Corp. for 13.5 million.

Even though Coral Castle is noted for the claim that it was built single-handedly by Leedskalnin using reverse magnetism or supernatural abilities, photographs and eyewitness accounts evidence that he used pulleys and other simple tools.

It is currently a privately operated tourist attraction, located in unincorporated territory of Miami-Dade County, Florida.

==History==
Coral Castle&#x27;s own promotional material says Edward Leedskalnin was 26 years old when he was suddenly rejected by his 16-year-old fiancée Agnes Skuvst in Latvia, just one day before the wedding. Leaving for the United States, he came down with allegedly terminal tuberculosis, but spontaneously healed, stating that magnets had some effect on his disease.

He spent more than 28 years building Coral Castle, refusing to allow anyone to view him while he worked. A few teenagers claimed to have witnessed his work, reporting that he had caused the blocks of coral to move like hydrogen balloons. The only advanced tool that Leedskalnin spoke of using was a &quot;perpetual motion holder&quot;.

Leedskalnin originally built a castle, which he named &quot;Ed&#x27;s Place&quot;, in Florida City, Florida, around 1923. He purchased the land from Ruben Moser whose wife had assisted him when he had another very bad case of tuberculosis. Florida City, which borders the Everglades, is the southernmost city in the United States that is not on an island. At the time, it was an extremely remote location with very little development. The castle remained in Florida City until about 1936 when Leedskalnin decided to move and take the castle with him. Its second and final location has the mailing address of 28655 South Dixie Highway, Miami, FL 33033, which now appears within the census-generated overlay of Leisure City but which is actually unincorporated county territory. He reportedly chose relocation as a means to protect his privacy when discussion about developing land in the original area of the castle started. He spent three years moving the component structures of Coral Castle north from Florida City to its current location outside Homestead, Florida.

Leedskalnin named his new place &quot;Rock Gate&quot; after the huge rear swinging gate he built into the back wall. He continued to work on the castle until his death in 1951. The oolite pieces that are part of the newer castle, not among those transported from the original location, were quarried on the property only a few feet away from the castle&#x27;s walls. The pool and the pit beside the southern wall are quarries. The east and west quarries have been filled in.

At Florida City, Leedskalnin charged visitors ten cents apiece to tour the castle grounds. After moving to Homestead, he asked for donations of twenty-five cents, but let visitors enter free if they had no money. There are signs carved into rocks at the front gate to &quot;Ring Bell Twice&quot;. He would come down from his living quarters in the second story of the castle tower close to the gate and conduct the tour. He never told anyone who asked him how he made the castle. He would simply answer &quot;It&#x27;s not difficult if you know how.&quot;

When asked why he had built the castle, Leedskalnin would vaguely answer it was for his &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot;. This is widely believed to be a reference to Agnes Skuvst (often misspelled as &quot;Scuffs&quot;). In Leedskalnin&#x27;s own publication &quot;A Book in Every Home&quot;, he implies his &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; was more an ideal than a reality. According to a Latvian account, the girl existed, but her name was actually Hermīne Lūsis.

When Leedskalnin became ill in November 1951, he put a sign on the door of the front gate &quot;Going to the Hospital&quot; and took the bus to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. He suffered a stroke at one point, either before he left for the hospital or at the hospital. He died twenty-eight days later of pyelonephritis (a kidney infection) at the age of 64. His death certificate noted that his death was a result of &quot;uremia; failure of kidneys, as a result of the infection and abscess&quot;.

While the property was being investigated, was found among Leedskalnin&#x27;s personal belongings. He had made his income from conducting tours, selling pamphlets about various subjects (including magnetic currents) and the sale of a portion of his property for the construction of U.S. Route 1. As he had no will, the castle became the property of his closest living relative in the United States, a nephew from Michigan named Harry.

Coral Castle&#x27;s website reports that the nephew was in poor health and he sold the castle to an Illinois family in 1953. However, this story differs from the obituary of a former Coral Castle owner, Julius Levin, a retired jeweler from Chicago, Illinois. The obituary states Levin had purchased the land from the state of Florida in 1952 and may not have been aware there was even a castle on the land.

The new owners turned it into a tourist attraction and changed the name of Rock Gate to Rock Gate Park, and later to Coral Castle.

In January 1981, Levin sold the castle to Coral Castle, Inc., for . The company retains ownership today.

In 1984, the property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was added under the name of &quot;Rock Gate&quot;, but the name on the list was changed to &quot;Coral Castle&quot; in 2011.

The stone sign just inside the property that says &quot;Adm. 10c Drop Below&quot; is not original to Coral Castle. Leedskalnin made this sign and placed it in front of his earlier location at Florida City when he was tired of giving a &quot;free show&quot; to visitors who were careless and trampled his shrubbery. This sign was donated by the owners of Ed&#x27;s Place and placed here in subsequent years.

==The Castle==
The grounds of Coral Castle consist of of stones in the form of walls, carvings, furniture, and a castle tower. Commonly mistakenly believed to be made of coral, it is actually made of oolite, also known as oolitic limestone. Oolite is a sedimentary rock composed of small spherical grains of concentrically layered carbonate that may include localized concentrations of fossil shells and coral. Miami Oolite is found throughout southeastern Florida from Palm Beach County to the Florida Keys. Oolite is often found beneath only several inches of topsoil, such as at the Coral Castle site.

The stones are fastened together without mortar. They are set on top of each other using their weight to keep them together. The craftsmanship detail is so fine and the stones are connected with such precision that no light passes through the joints. The tall vertical stones that make up the perimeter wall have a uniform height. Even with the passage of decades the stones have not shifted.

Among the features and carvings are a two-story castle tower that served as Leedskalnin&#x27;s living quarters (walls consisting of 8-foot-high pieces of stone), an accurate sundial, a polar telescope, an obelisk, a barbecue, a water well, a fountain, celestial stars and planets, and numerous pieces of furniture. The furniture pieces include a heart-shaped table, a table in the shape of Florida, twenty-five rocking chairs, chairs resembling crescent moons, a bathtub, beds, and a throne.

With few exceptions, the objects are made from single pieces of stone that weigh on average each. The largest stone weighs and the tallest are two monoliths standing each.

A revolving 8-foot tall gate is a famous structure of the castle, documented on the television programs &quot;In Search of...&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Incredible!&quot;. The gate is carved so that it fits within a quarter of an inch of the walls. It was well-balanced, reportedly so that a child could open it with the push of a finger. The mystery of the gate&#x27;s perfectly balanced axis and the ease with which it revolved lasted for decades until it stopped working in 1986. In order to remove it, six men and a crane were used. Once the gate was removed, the engineers discovered how Leedskalnin had centered and balanced it. He had drilled a hole from top to bottom and inserted a metal shaft. The rock rested on an old truck bearing. It was the rusting out of this bearing that resulted in the gate&#x27;s failure to revolve. Complete with new bearings and shaft, it was set back into place on July 23, 1986. It failed in 2005 and was again repaired; however, it does not rotate with the same ease it once did.

Coral Castle remains a popular tourist attraction. Books, magazines, and television programs speculate about how Leedskalnin was able to construct the structure and move stones that weigh many tons. Claims that nobody had ever seen Leedskalnin at work and that he levitated his stones have been repudiated. Orval Irwin reportedly witnessed him quarry his stones and erect parts of his wall, and illustrated the methods in his book &quot;Mr. Can&#x27;t Is Dead&quot;. The Nemith Film Collection produced a short film documentary in 1944 of him at work . Coral Castle&#x27;s website states that, &quot;If anyone ever questioned Ed about how he moved the blocks of coral, Ed would only reply that he understood the laws of weight and leverage well.&quot; He also stated that he had &quot;discovered the secrets of the pyramids&quot;, referring to the Great Pyramid of Giza.

<doc id="627862" wikidata="Q1922310" url="?curid=627862" title="Mescalero (album)">
<text>Mescalero is the fourteenth studio album by the American rock band ZZ Top. It was released in September 2003, as the band&#x27;s final release for RCA Records. While the band still retained their foundation in blues rock, &quot;Mescalero&quot; explored genres like country and Tejano. Recording sessions took place at Foam Box Recordings in Houston, with Billy Gibbons as producer.

==Background and recording==
In 1993, ZZ Top signed with RCA Records, which produced &quot;Antenna&quot; (1994), &quot;Rhythmeen&quot; (1996), and &quot;XXX&quot;, the latter of which marked the band&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary and received mixed reviews from critics. They mostly toured in the years between &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;Mescalero&quot;, visiting Australia, New Zealand and various countries in Europe. In 2002, the band performed at the annual RodeoHouston and with Brooks &amp; Dunn on CMT Crossroads. They went on a short Casino Tour in the United States and European Tour.

In 2002, ZZ Top convened at Foam Box Recordings in Houston, a private studio owned by the band that was used to record &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;Rhythmeen&quot;. Gibbons produced the project and wrote most of the songs, collaborating with the engineers Joe Hardy and Gary Moon, as well as band members Dusty Hill and Frank Beard. A variety of instruments was used on &quot;Mescalero&quot;. After taking a lunch break at a Mexican restaurant, ZZ Top hired a father-and-son marimba duo from Chiapas, Mexico. They provided entertainment at the restaurant and were anxious to appear on a rock album. After explaining that there were only three chords involved, they played on the title track. James Harman played harmonica on &quot;Que Lastima&quot;, a title meaning &#x27;what a pity&#x27;.

===Music===
&quot;Mescalero&quot; is centered on a variety of Tejano instrumentation including accordion, pedal steel guitar, and harmonica. The album often uses slide guitar and &quot;fuzzy&quot; bass guitar sounds. It opens with &quot;Mescalero&quot;, a track with marimbas used throughout the entire song and a solo at the end. &quot;Two Ways to Play&quot; is a hard rock-inspired track in which Gibbons&#x27; guitar is tuned down a whole step from standard pitch. &quot;Alley-Gator&quot; made use of the accordion and a 1955 Gibson Les Paul Goldtop played by Gibbons. &quot;Buck Nekkid&quot; is a moderate swing, while &quot;Goin&#x27; So Good&quot; is a slow ballad on which Gibbons used a 1949 Fender Telecaster prototype and played Steve Cropper-tinged licks; he traded phrases in call and response form with a pedal steel guitar. &quot;Me So Stupid&quot; is a moderate rock with a clip of Gibbons&#x27; voice remaining constant throughout the track. Dusty Hill sang lead vocals on &quot;Piece&quot;. Auto-Tune is used on Gibbons&#x27; vocals at several points on the album, most audibly on &quot;What Would You Do&quot;, &quot;Que Lastima&quot; and &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;.

===Album art===
The album depicts a skeleton wearing a sarape and a sombrero while drinking mescal in the desert. The skeleton appears to be shooting flames out of its mouth. The title, &quot;Mescalero&quot;, refers to a heavy mescal drinker.

===Promotion===
In 2003, ZZ Top showcased two tracks from &quot;Mescalero&quot; in a performance at RodeoHouston in Texas. &quot;Buck Nekkid&quot; was used in a television commercial promoting the album.

===Reception===

Allmusic awarded the album two out of five stars, stating, &quot;Apart from the dreadful misstep of 1999&#x27;s &quot;XXX&quot;, they showed signs of life on all their RCA labeled albums, and their fourth, 2003&#x27;s long delayed &quot;Mescalero&quot;, is no exception to the rule. Billy Gibbons&#x27; fat guitar tone really has some presence here, at least on some of the album, and there are enough rhythm tracks not performed to a didactic click track to provide some real swing.&quot;

The album peaked at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Tour==
Following &quot;Mescalero&quot;&#x27;s release, ZZ Top embarked on the Beer Drinkers and Hell Raisers Tour (April–November 2003). The tour spanned three months in the US with Ted Nugent (featuring drummer Tommy Aldridge and bassist Marco Mendoza) as the middle act, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd (with Double Trouble) as the opener, with a European leg visiting twelve countries and included a concert in Helsinki, Finland, as special guests with The Rolling Stones. After returning to the United States for more performances, ZZ Top appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;; they played at the Compaq Center (previously known as The Summit); this was the last event to be held in the venue. The band continued touring to support &quot;Mescalero&quot; throughout summer 2004 and performed at the Crossroads Guitar Festival.

<text>Orchidantha is a genus of flowering plants. In the APG III system, it is placed in the family Lowiaceae, as the sole genus. It includes the plants in the formerly recognised genera &quot;Lowia&quot; and &quot;Protamomum&quot;.

&quot;Orchidantha&quot; remains a poorly known genus, found from southern China to Borneo. &quot;Orchidantha&quot; means &quot;orchid-flower&quot;, as one of the petals on the flowers is modified into a labellum, like the flowers of orchids. One species, &quot;Orchidantha inouei&quot; of Borneo, imitates the smell of dung in order to attract small &quot;Onthophagus&quot; dung beetles as pollinators.

<text>Louis Black is an American journalist and businessman who is the co-founder of &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot;, an alternative weekly newspaper published in Austin, Texas, and was the newspaper&#x27;s editor from its inception until his retirement on August 8, 2017. He has written over 600 articles in his column in that newspaper. Black is also the co-founder of the South by Southwest Festival, also located in Austin, although the festival operates separately from the &quot;Chronicle&quot;. He also is a founding partner in Toronto&#x27;s North by Northeast music and film festival.

Black was born in Teaneck, New Jersey where he was childhood friends with film critic Leonard Maltin and singer Phoebe Snow. Maltin and Black attended Teaneck High School and regularly prowled the rep cinemas of Manhattan as teens before graduating in 1968. He moved to Austin to study film at The University of Texas where he received a BFA in 1980, and became knowledgeable about B-movies, including the work of Russ Meyer. Black helped run film nights at the university before starting the &quot;Chronicle&quot; with film friend Nick Barbaro.

Black was an original board member of the Austin Film Society and is a past president of that organization. In 2000, &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; Editor Evan Smith and Black working with AFS established the Texas Film Hall of Fame.

He was executive producer of a documentary on Texan songwriter Townes Van Zandt. In addition to serving as executive producer, he also directed a documentary about Austin director Richard Linklater which premiered on PBS&#x27;s American Masters. He appeared in the film &quot;The Devil and Daniel Johnston&quot; as Black was an early supporter of the singer.

In October 2023 Black and the Austin Chronicle were sued for alleged harassment, abuse, and &quot;sexual servitude.&quot;

<text>Walter Lockhart Gordon (27 January 1906 – 21 March 1987) was a Canadian accountant, businessman, politician, and writer.

==Education==
Born in Toronto, the son of Lieutenant-Colonel H. D. L. Gordon, DSO, he was educated at Upper Canada College and the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.

==Early business career==
Upon graduation, he joined the family accounting firm of Clarkson, Gordon and Company, in January 1927. He was a student there for four years, became a chartered accountant in early 1931, and was promoted to partner in 1935.

During World War II, Gordon served in the Bank of Canada and the federal Ministry of Finance. In 1946, he chaired the Royal Commission on Administrative Classifications in the Public Service.

==The beginnings of economic nationalism==
From 1955 to 1957, Gordon chaired the Royal Commission on Canada&#x27;s Economic Prospects. The commission&#x27;s reports, issued in 1956 and 1957, expressed concern about growing foreign ownership in the Canadian economy, particularly in the resource sector, and made recommendations to redress the problem. The themes raised in the reports were revisited by Gordon in his government career.

==Political career==
In the 1962 federal election, he was elected to the House of Commons of Canada as a Liberal. He was Minister of Finance from 1963 to 1965, during Prime Minister Lester Pearson&#x27;s first minority government. Gordon&#x27;s 1965 budget, which included an 11% tax on construction materials and manufacturing equipment, as well as the expansion of social programs, was attacked by the Opposition parties. Gordon persuaded Pearson to call the 1965 federal election and co-chaired the Liberal campaign. When the election failed to return a Liberal majority, Gordon, taking responsibility for giving the prime minister poor advice, resigned from Cabinet and returned to the backbench. In 1967, he returned to Cabinet as President of the Privy Council from 1967 to 1968. He was noted for his economic nationalism and his support for new social programs.

Gordon disagreed, often sharply, with Pearson over the significant expansion in federal expenditures and the decline of sound financial management in Pearson&#x27;s second administration, which began in 1965. The long friendship between the two men, which had begun in the mid-1930s, gradually unravelled.

Gordon supported Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s winning 1968 bid for the Liberal leadership, after Pearson announced his retirement in late 1967. Trudeau, after he became prime minister, invited Gordon to join his Cabinet in April 1968. However, Gordon declined over some misgivings about being able to work successfully with Trudeau and decided not to run again for office in the June 1968 general election.

==Returns to business==
After leaving politics in 1968, he returned to business. He continued to argue for economic nationalist causes and in 1970, along with Peter C. Newman of the Toronto Star, economist Abraham Rotstein, and University of Toronto professor Mel Watkins, founded the Committee for an Independent Canada. Canadian historian Jack Granatstein argues in &quot;Yankee Go Home?&quot; that the CIC &quot;helped to create the atmosphere in which Trudeau&#x27;s government established the Canada Development Corporation in 1971 to &#x27;buy back&#x27; Canada.&quot;

==Later years==
Gordon was the Chancellor of York University from 1973 to 1977. According to Dr. Stephen Azzi, Walter Gordon is responsible for &quot;New Nationalism&quot; in Canada. This is the idea of supporting stronger ties with Great Britain, to prevent Canada being absorbed by United States.
He published his political memoirs in 1977. He died in 1987.

==Honours and awards==

In 1976, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1946 for his war services.
In 2009, 1681 Honourable Walter L. Gordon, PC, CC, CBE, FCA, LLD (1906–1987) was added to the wall of honour at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario.

== Archives ==
There is a Walter Lockhart Gordon fonds at Library and Archives Canada.

<text>Glacial Lake Iroquois was a prehistoric proglacial lake that existed at the end of the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago.

== Description ==
The lake was essentially an enlargement of the present Lake Ontario that formed because the St. Lawrence River downstream from the lake was blocked by the ice sheet near the present Thousand Islands. The level of the lake was approximately 30 m (~100 ft) above the present level of Lake Ontario.

The lake drained to the southeast, through a channel passing near present day Rome, New York. The Rome Sand Plains has several sand ridges that geologists think were formed at this time. The channel then followed the valley of the Mohawk River to the Hudson River.

The lake was fed by Early Lake Erie, as well as Glacial Lake Algonquin, an early partial manifestation of Lake Huron, that drained directly to Lake Iroquois across southern Ontario, along the southern edge of the ice sheet, bypassing Early Lake Erie.

The subsequent melting of the ice dam resulted in a sudden lowering of the lake to its present level, a potential trigger for the Younger Dryas episode.

==Remnant shorelines==
Two ancient shorelines in the Toronto area mark the existence of former glacial lakes. About 2 km inland from the shore, a ridge known as the &quot;Iroquois Shoreline&quot; can be discerned. The old shoreline runs west-east, running roughly parallel to Davenport Road just south of St. Clair Avenue West. Further east, the Scarborough Bluffs also formed part of the shoreline of the ancient lake. In Mississauga, the shoreline is found south of Dundas Street and most visible with hills found east and west of Mavis Road.

Another ancient shoreline exists between 2–4 km offshore of Toronto. It is known as the &quot;Toronto Scarp&quot; and formed the shore of Glacial Lake Warren or Admiralty Lake. From Bluffer&#x27;s Park in Scarborough to just west of Hanlan&#x27;s Point is an underwater bluff.

In Hamilton, Ontario the Burlington Heights represents a sand and gravel bar formed across the mouth of Cootes Paradise, at the western end of Glacial Lake Iroquois. 

In New York, Ridge Road and New York State Route 104 run from west to east along a ridge of the old shoreline of Lake Iroquois.

<text>Jean Elias Benjamin Valz (May 27, 1787 – April 22, 1867) was a French astronomer.

He was born in Nîmes and trained as an engineer. He was the son of politician Jean Valz and the grandson of the doctor, meteorologist and naturalist Pierre Baux (1708–1790). He became interested in astronomy and comets in particular, observing the return of what would later be named Comet Encke. He later made a very complete calculation of the orbital elements of another comet, for which he won recognition.

In 1835 he hypothesized that irregularities in Comet Halley&#x27;s orbit could be explained by an unknown planet beyond Uranus — at the time, Neptune was not yet discovered.

He built a private observatory at his home and when he left in 1836 to take up a post as director of the Marseille Observatory, he left the use of his home to Joseph Jean Pierre Laurent, who used the observatory to discover the asteroid 51 Nemausa. The house, at 32 rue Nationale in Nîmes, has a plaque commemorating the discovery.

Valz himself was at one time said to be the discoverer of two asteroids, 20 Massalia and 25 Phocaea, but nowadays these are credited to the Italian astronomer Annibale de Gasparis and to Valz&#x27;s colleague Jean Chacornac, respectively.

In 1874, Valz&#x27;s widow donated 10,000 francs to the French Academy of Sciences to establish a prize in honor of her late husband. The Valz Prize &quot;(Prix Valz)&quot; was awarded for work of similar stature as that honored by the pre-existing Lalande Prize. The Valz Prize was given out from 1877 through 1970.

<text>Joseph Jean Pierre Laurent (or Joseph Laurent) (died 1900) was a French amateur astronomer and chemist who discovered the asteroid 51 Nemausa in 1858, for which he was a recipient of the Lalande Prize awarded by the French Academy of Sciences. It is also likely that he is the same person as the person of that name who provided chemistry assistance to photography pioneer André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri in 1853.

He never made any more asteroid discoveries and not much is known about him. He was described as a &quot;very skillful young man&quot; (&quot;un jeune homme très habile&quot;) by Édouard Stephan. He was described as a &quot;distinguished pupil of the Marseille school&quot;, and as an amateur astronomer and an inspector of the assay office in Nîmes (&quot;contrôleur du bureau de garantie de Nîmes&quot;).

The asteroid was discovered using the private observatory at the house formerly occupied by Benjamin Valz, who left in 1836 to become the new director of the Marseille Observatory. He entrusted his former observatory to Laurent, who later found the asteroid. The house, at 32 rue Nationale in Nîmes (at that time known as rue de l&#x27;Agau), has a plaque commemorating the discovery.

Laurent was awarded the Lalande Prize of the French Academy of Sciences in 1858 for his discovery, jointly with five other asteroid and comet discoverers. In addition, asteroid 162 Laurentia was named in his honour.

Laurent was named assistant astronomer at the Marseille Observatory on 26 November 1858, however he resigned on 20 February 1859. He cited the disorder in the management of the observatory by Valz as the reason. Valz for his part blamed Laurent for neglecting his duties and disloyalty, in a 14 May 1863 letter to d&#x27;Abbadie.

Upon his resignation in February 1859, Laurent started a chemical analysis and testing laboratory in Marseille under the name J. Icard et J. Laurent.

== First name ==

Nineteenth-century sources do not mention his first name, referring to him only as &quot;M. Laurent&quot;, the standard French abbreviation for Monsieur Laurent. At one time the Minor Planet Center, which lists asteroid discoverers using their initials and surname, gave his name as &quot;A. Laurent&quot;, with the &quot;A.&quot; (for &quot;Anonymous&quot;) as a sort of placeholder for an unknown first name. However, in a letter dated 5 September 1858 to Benjamin Valz, Laurent wrote that his first name is Joseph-Jean-Pierre (see image), and the Minor Planet Center now uses &quot;J. J. P. Laurent&quot;.

When using only an initial rather than his full first name, he sometimes used &quot;J. Laurent&quot;. A small set of astronomical charts known to have been drawn up by Laurent himself, as well as a hand-drawn star chart portraying the discovery of 51 Nemausa, show his name as J. Laurent (see images). Philippe Véron in his unpublished &quot;Dictionnaire des astronomes français&quot; gives his name as &quot;Joseph Laurent&quot;

In 1857, it was reported that Valz had undertaken the publication of equinoxial charts, to be drawn up by Laurent. When Valz reported the discovery of Nemausa in a letter to the &quot;Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des séances de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot;, he cited this as the &quot;first success&quot; of these equinoxial charts. The equinoxial charts in question indicate the author as &quot;J. Laurent&quot; &quot;(see image)&quot; and this is also indicated in a library catalog. A notation (see image) at the top of a hand-drawn star chart in the Observatoire de Marseille – Patrimoines archives notes the discovery of the asteroid as follows: &quot;Némausa (51) dec. [ = découverte ] à Nîmes par J. Laurent (22 janvier 1858)&quot;, which means &quot;51 Nemausa disc. [ = discovered ] at Nîmes by J. Laurent (22 January 1858)&quot;.

== Possible connection to photography pioneer Disdéri ==

André-Adolphe-Eugène Disdéri pioneered the &quot;carte de visite&quot;, an early form of mass-production portraiture photography. According to his biographer Elizabeth Anne McCauley, Disdéri developed this process during his stay in Nîmes in 1853, and then moved back to Paris to make his fortune. She cites Disdéri&#x27;s own book which thanks a chemist and assay office inspector in Nîmes named Monsieur Laurent for his assistance with the chemistry. In her book McCauley identifies the full name of this Monsieur Laurent as Joseph Jean Pierre Laurent, citing an 1855 passport application.

The coincidence of name, profession, city and time period is suggestive, however a definitive link to the discoverer of the asteroid has not been established.

In general, hereditary office holders (kings, queens, emperors, emirs, and the like) and holders of offices where the normal term limit is life (popes, presidents for life, etc.) are excluded because, until recently, their death in office was the norm.

Such deaths have most often been from natural causes, but there are also cases of assassination, execution, suicide, accident and even death in battle.

The list is in chronological order. The name is listed first, followed by the year of death, the country, the name of the office the person held at the time of death, the location of the death (where known) and the cause of death.

<text>The Marantaceae are a family, the arrowroot family, or the prayer plant family, of flowering plants consisting of 31 genera and around 530 species, defining it as one of the most species-rich families in its order. Species of this family are found in lowland tropical forests of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. The majority (80%) of the species are found in the American tropics, followed by Asian (11%) and African (9%) tropics. They are commonly called the prayer-plant family and are also known for their unique secondary pollination presentation.

==Description==
The plants usually have underground rhizomes or tubers. The leaves are arranged in two rows with the petioles having a sheathing base. The leaf blade is narrow or broad with pinnate veins running parallel to the midrib. The petiole may be winged, and swollen into a pulvinus at the base.

The inflorescence is a spike or panicle, enclosed by spathe-like bracts. The flowers are small and often inconspicuous, irregular, and bisexual, usually with an outer three free sepals and an inner series of three petaloid-like segments, tube-like in appearance. The fruit is either fleshy or a loculicidal capsule. Many species have only a single stamen and that stamen has only a single locule, an oddity they share only with the genus Canna.

==Taxonomy==
The APG II system, of 2003 (unchanged from the APG system, 1998), also recognizes this family, and assigns it to the order Zingiberales in the clade commelinids in the monocots. The Marantaceae are considered the most family in this group due to the extreme reduction in both stamens and carpels.

The family consists of 29 genera with about 570 known species, found in the tropical areas of the world except in Australia. The biggest concentration is in the Americas, with seven genera in Africa, and six in Asia.

==Seed dispersal==
Arilated seeds of Marantaceae are dispersed mainly by birds and mammals. In Amazonia, crickets and ants are important secondary dispersers.

==Phytochemistry==
Rosmarinic acid can be found in plants in the family Marantaceae such as species in the genera &quot;Maranta&quot; (&quot;Maranta leuconeura&quot;, &quot;Maranta depressa&quot;) and &quot;Thalia&quot; (&quot;Thalia geniculata&quot;).

==Rapid plant movement: secondary pollination presentation==
Marantaceae have a distinctive pollination mechanism that is defined by an explosive style movement. It is commonly termed explosive because the action is swift, occurs only one time for each flower, and is irreversible. This quick pollination event plays a significant role in optimizing mating and has been hypothesized to be a factor in the high level of speciation within this family. There are two parts of the floral anatomy that contribute to the explosive pollination mechanism: the style and the hooded staminode.

The secondary pollination presentation begins after a mechanical stimulus is introduced by a pollinator on the trigger appendage of the hooded staminode. Touching this trigger causes the release of the style from the contacted staminode, leading to rapid inward rolling of the style which is no longer being held under high tension. During this quick rolling movement, self pollen (located on top of the style) is deposited on the pollinator while cross-pollen is scooped off the pollinator into the stigmatic cavity. This single action occurs very quickly with the full movement being clocked in at around 0.03 seconds.

==Uses==
The most well-known species in the family is arrowroot (&quot;Maranta arundinacea&quot;), a plant of the Caribbean, grown in parts of the Caribbean, Australasia, and sub-Saharan Africa for its easily digestible starch known as arrowroot. It is grown commercially in the West Indies and tropical Americas.

Several species of genus &quot;Goeppertia&quot; are grown as houseplants for their large ornamental leaves, which are variegated in shades of green, white, and pink. Other genera grown for houseplants includes &quot;Stromanthe&quot;, &quot;Ctenanthe&quot;, and &quot;Maranta&quot;.

&quot;Calathea lutea&quot; has tough, durable leaves used to make waterproof baskets, and in the Caribbean and Central America, its leaves are used for roofing. Two Mexican species - &quot;C. macrosepala&quot; and &quot;C. violacea&quot; - have flowers that are cooked and used as vegetables. &quot;C. allouia&quot; or leren, from the West Indies and tropical America, is known as sweet corn root for its edible tuber.

&quot;Schumannianthus dichotomus&quot; is used for weaving mats to use on floors and beds.

<text>Walter Arthur Gordon (October 10, 1894 – April 2, 1976) was the first African American to receive a JD from University of California, Berkeley School of Law. He had an extremely long and varied career where he served as a police officer, lawyer, assistant football coach, member of the California Adult Authority, Governor of the United States Virgin Islands, and a Federal District Judge.

==Early life and education==
Gordon was born in Atlanta, Georgia, though his family moved to Riverside, California in 1904. He graduated from Riverside Polytechnic High School before enrolling in the University of California, Berkeley, where he lettered in football (as a lineman for the California Golden Bears), boxing, and wrestling.

Gordon was the star of Cal&#x27;s boxing team, winning the California State Championship. He was the star of Cal&#x27;s wrestling team, winning the California State Championship in that sport as well. He was also a star on college football Hall of Fame coach Andy Smith&#x27;s early Cal football teams, playing on both the offensive and defensive lines. In fact, during his Cal football career, at one time or another he played every position on both lines except center. At 6&#x27;0&quot; and 200 pounds, he was one of the biggest men on the team, but with tremendous quickness, and an instinct for knowing where to be on the field.

He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. He was also a founding member of the Alpha Epsilon chapter at University of California, Berkeley.

In 1918 he became one of the first two African-American All-Americans (the first was Paul Robeson). He was later named to the College Football Hall of Fame. He graduated in 1918 and enrolled in Boalt Hall to study law. He married Mary Elizabeth Fisher on July 22, 1920 and received his Doctor of Jurisprudence degree in 1922.

==Careers in California==
In 1919, Gordon began two of his careers: he was hired as a scout and part-time assistant coach of the Golden Bears and joined the police force in Berkeley, California. In 1922, he began his third career and opened a law office in Oakland, California. He continued all three jobs until 1930, when he retired from the police force. He was branch president of the Berkeley NAACP in the 1930s. During the Zoot Suit Riots of Los Angeles in 1943 there were clashes between Mexican American youths and servicemen. Governor Earl Warren sent a team, headed by Walter Gordon, to Los Angeles to evaluate the conflict. Later in 1943, he retired as the assistant coach to join the California Adult Authority, that state&#x27;s parole board, and eventually became chairman, serving for nine years. In 1944, he retired from law.

==Careers in the United States Virgin Islands==
In 1955, while still working for the Adult Authority, he was appointed Governor of the United States Virgin Islands. That same year, he was named as UC Berkeley alumnus of the year and received the Benjamin Ide Wheeler Medal. In 1958, he resigned as Governor to take an appointment as a Federal Judge of the District Court of the Virgin Islands, where he served for 10 years.

<text>Lipps, Inc. ( , a pun on the phrase &quot;lip sync&quot;) was an American disco and funk group from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The group is best known for the chart-topping 1980 worldwide hit single &quot;Funkytown&quot;, which hit No. 1 in 28 countries and was certified as double platinum in sales.

The group originally consisted of lead vocalist Cynthia Johnson and a changing line-up of session musicians, including guitarist David Rivkin, guitarist Tom Riopelle and bassist Terry Grant. Steven Greenberg, the creator of the act, wrote and produced most of the group&#x27;s music.

==History==
Lipps Inc. started as a project of Steven Greenberg when he was a wedding DJ who wanted to try his hand at writing disco songs. He had intended to use the name Lip Sync, but it was in use by another group, so instead he chose the homophone Lipps Inc. Greenberg was the sole member of the group until he met Cynthia Johnson while auditioning singers for his song &quot;Rock It&quot;. Johnson joined the project, and Lipps Inc. became a duo.

Lipps Inc.&#x27;s first release was the 1979 single &quot;Rock It&quot; on Greenberg&#x27;s Flight imprint. The act released its debut album &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; in late 1979.

With the release of the album, &quot;Funkytown&quot; became the second single from &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot; and spent four weeks at No. 1 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and Hot Dance Music/Club Play charts in the United States; the previously released “Rock It” was also on the album, with a slightly different mix. The 7&quot; single of &quot;Funkytown&quot; sold more than 2 million copies within a few months, and it was awarded a platinum record within the year of its release. It reached No. 2 in the United Kingdom and was a hit throughout the world.

Lipps Inc.&#x27;s later singles failed to match the band&#x27;s previous success (the only other Hot 100 entry was &quot;Rock It&quot;, which peaked at No. 64). However, more dance hits were released during the 1980s, including &quot;How Long&quot; in 1981 (originally a hit for Ace), which reached No. 4 on the U.S. dance chart. After &quot;Designer Music&quot;, the group&#x27;s third album, Johnson left the band and was replaced by Margie Cox and Melanie Rosales. Lipps Inc. released &quot;4&quot;, its final album, in 1983, and disbanded two years later.

===Europe===
The &quot;face&quot; of the group in the Netherlands was the British dancer Doris D (Debbie Jenner), who playbacked the song in TopPop with her dancers. Due to the success of this performance, they were invited to perform as Lipps Inc. in other European countries, including Germany. Jenner and her dancers then had success as &quot;Doris D &amp; the Pins&quot; in early 1981.

<doc id="627935" wikidata="Q1170898" url="?curid=627935" title="Mark of the Vampire">
<text>Mark of the Vampire is a 1935 American horror film directed by Tod Browning, and starring Lionel Barrymore, Elizabeth Allan, Bela Lugosi, Lionel Atwill, and Jean Hersholt, produced by Metro Goldwyn Mayer. Its plot follows a series of deaths and attacks by vampires that brings eminent expert Professor Zelen to the aid of Irena Borotyn, who is about to be married. Her father, Sir Karell, died from complete loss of blood, with bite wounds on his neck, and it appears he may be one of the undead now plaguing the area.

It has been described as a talkie remake of Browning&#x27;s silent &quot;London After Midnight&quot; (1927), though it does not credit the older film or its writers.

==Plot==
Sir Karell Borotyn is found murdered in his house, with two tiny pinpoint wounds on his neck. The attending doctor, Dr. Doskil, and Sir Karell&#x27;s friend Baron Otto von Zinden are convinced that he was killed by a vampire. They suspect Count Mora and his daughter Luna, while the Prague Police Inspector Neumann refuses to believe them.

Sir Karell&#x27;s daughter Irena is the Count&#x27;s next target. Professor Zelen, an expert on vampires and the occult, arrives in order to prevent her death. After Irena is menaced by the vampires on several occasions, Zelen, Baron Otto, and Inspector Neumann descend into the ruined parts of the castle to hunt down the undead monsters and destroy them. When Zelen and Baron Otto find themselves alone, however, Zelen hypnotizes the Baron and asks him to relive the night of Sir Karell&#x27;s murder. It is then revealed that the &quot;vampires&quot; are actually hired actors, and that the entire experience has been an elaborate concocted by Zelen in the hopes of tricking the real murderer —Baron Otto— into confessing to the crime. Acknowledging that the charade has failed to produce its intended results, Zelen, along with Irena and another actor who strongly resembles Sir Karell, compels the hypnotized Baron into re-enacting the murder, effectively proving his guilt. During the re-enactment, Baron Otto reveals his true motive: he wished to marry Irena, but her father would not allow it. He also reveals how he staged the murder to resemble a vampire attack.

With Baron Otto arrested, Irena explains the plot to her fiance, Fedor, who was not involved in the subterfuge and believed that the vampires were real. The film ends with the actors who played the vampires packing up their supplies, and &quot;Count Mora&quot; exclaiming, &quot;This vampire business, it has given me a great idea for a new act! Luna, in the new act, I will be the vampire! Did you watch me? I gave all of me! I was greater than any &quot;real&quot; vampire!&quot; His fellow thespians are not enthusiastic.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Development===

The film&#x27;s screenplay was co-written by Guy Endore, who had previously written the novels for &quot;The Werewolf of Paris&quot; (1933) and &quot;Babouk&quot; (1934). The film had the working title &quot;Vampires of Prague&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on January 12, 1935, and completed in mid-February 1935. Co-star Carroll Borland had worked with Lugosi before, in a touring stage version of &quot;Dracula&quot;; she answered the casting call for the younger vampire role without being aware Lugosi was associated with the film, and won the part after the producers were impressed with how closely her physical movements resembled Lugosi&#x27;s. She did not mention that they had previously worked together. Makeup artist William J. Tuttle would later recollect to author Richard Bojarski,

According to Borland, the ending of the film (which reveals the &quot;vampires&quot; to be actors hired to trick a murderer) was not revealed to the cast until the end of shooting; Browning felt that their performances would be negatively affected by knowing that they were not &quot;real&quot; vampires. She reports that an alternate ending – in which Professor Zelen receives a telegram from the hired actors revealing that they were unable to make their train (thus implying the vampires that the film depicts were real) – was considered but rejected by Browning. She further claims that both she and Lugosi were disappointed with the ending, and found the twist &quot;absurd.&quot;

==Release==
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer released &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; theatrically on April 26, 1935.

===Alternate versions===
Early reviews of the film list running times of closer to 80 minutes, strongly suggesting that the film was cut back to 60 minutes by MGM after the early previews. This had led to much speculation about what the deleted footage contained.

Several sources, including critic Mark Viera and Turner Classic Movies writer Jeff Stafford, have claimed that MGM cut out suggestions of incest between Count Mora (played by Lugosi) and his daughter Luna. Viera further claims that the original screenplay explained that Count Mora was condemned to eternity as a vampire for this crime and shot himself out of guilt (which explains the otherwise unaccountable spot of blood which appears on Lugosi&#x27;s right temple during the film). This was an unacceptable topic according to the standards of the Production Code, and consequently cut from the film. While the subplot was cut, the blood spot on Count Mora&#x27;s face remains in the finished film and is never explained.

Writer Gregory William Mank (who had access to the shooting script for his book &quot;Hollywood Cauldron&quot;) disputes these claims, asserting that the original cut was only 75 minutes (the reports of an 80+ minute run time being the result of a misprint) and that most of the cuts were either exposition or comedy. He further asserts that the alleged incest subplot was never in the shooting script and never filmed, though he acknowledges that it was likely hinted at in the original scenario for the film written by Guy Endore. This claim is backed up by Borland, who points out that the studio would never have allowed such content to be filmed.

Lugosi biographer Arthur Lennig asserts that Endore did originally intend an incest backstory, but that it was removed by the studio before the shooting script was written, though he goes on to claim that a cut line of dialogue indicates that Count Mora shot himself after strangling his daughter.

In the commentary which accompanies the film on the &quot;Hollywood Legends of Horror&quot; boxed set released by Warner Home Video, genre historians Kim Newman and Steve Jones seem to concur with Mank, hypothesizing that primarily comedic material—possibly related to the maid character played by Leila Bennett—was cut.

===Home media===
MGM/UA Home Video released &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; on VHS in October 1987. The Warner Archive Collection released the film on Blu-ray on October 11, 2022.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; was a moderate box-office success, earning Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer a profit of $54,000 ().

===Critical response===
Upon its initial release, reviews of the film were relatively positive; a &quot;New York Times&quot; review by Frank Nugent claimed the film would &quot;catch the beholder&#x27;s attention and hold it, through chills and thrills ...&quot; The review finished, &quot;Like most good ghost stories, it&#x27;s a lot of fun, even though you don&#x27;t believe a word of it.&quot; It received similar praise from &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, and &quot;Motion Picture Daily&quot;. The film did draw some distinct criticism as well, most notably from Dr. William J. Robinson, who claimed in a letter to the &quot;New York Times&quot; that,

Seymour Roman of the &quot;Brooklyn Times-Union&quot; praised the film as &quot;a gloriously unrestrained example of the cinema [of the] supernatural, thrilling, chilling, and horrifying.&quot;

Modern evaluations of the film are more mixed, largely due to the ending, which reveals that the vampires were actors hired to help trap a murderer (the twist is very similar to Browning&#x27;s previous &quot;London After Midnight&quot;, where Lon Chaney&#x27;s vampire character is ultimately revealed to be a detective in disguise). While it was not unusual for 1920s films such as &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; or &quot;The Gorilla&quot; to end with a revelation that the supernatural threat was a fraud, 1930s films such as &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&quot; presented the supernatural elements as real, making &quot;Mark of the Vampire&quot; something of an anachronism for its time (particularly since Browning and Lugosi were most known for &quot;Dracula&quot; just a few years earlier). Some viewers thought that the ending compromised the film; Bela Lugosi reportedly found the idea absurd. Some critics, including genre critics Kim Newman and Steve Jones, have suggested the film may be a satire of the conventions of the horror film, pointing to the broad performances by Barrymore and some of the supporting characters, as well as the film&#x27;s twist ending.

<text>Pyramidal cells, or pyramidal neurons, are a type of multipolar neuron found in areas of the brain including the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus, and the amygdala. Pyramidal cells are the primary excitation units of the mammalian prefrontal cortex and the corticospinal tract. One of the main structural features of the pyramidal neuron is the conic shaped soma, or cell body, after which the neuron is named. Other key structural features of the pyramidal cell are a single axon, a large apical dendrite, multiple basal dendrites, and the presence of dendritic spines. 

Pyramidal neurons are also one of two cell types where the characteristic sign, Negri bodies, are found in post-mortem rabies infection. Pyramidal neurons were first discovered and studied by Santiago Ramón y Cajal. Since then, studies on pyramidal neurons have focused on topics ranging from neuroplasticity to cognition.
== Structure ==
One of the main structural features of the pyramidal neuron is the conic shaped soma, or cell body, after which the neuron is named. Other key structural features of the pyramidal cell are a single axon, a large apical dendrite, multiple basal dendrites, and the presence of dendritic spines.

===Apical dendrite===
The apical dendrite rises from the apex of the pyramidal cell&#x27;s soma. The apical dendrite is a single, long, thick dendrite that branches several times as distance from the soma increases and extends towards the cortical surface.

===Basal dendrite===
Basal dendrites arise from the base of the soma. The basal dendritic tree consists of three to five primary dendrites. As distance increases from the soma, the basal dendrites branch profusely.

Pyramidal cells are among the largest neurons in the brain. Both in humans and rodents, pyramidal cell bodies (somas) average around 20 μm in length. Pyramidal dendrites typically range in diameter from half a micrometer to several micrometers. The length of a single dendrite is usually several hundred micrometers. Due to branching, the total dendritic length of a pyramidal cell may reach several centimeters. The pyramidal cell&#x27;s axon is often even longer and extensively branched, reaching many centimeters in total length.

===Dendritic spines===

Dendritic spines receive most of the excitatory impulses (EPSPs) that enter a pyramidal cell. Dendritic spines were first noted by Ramón y Cajal in 1888 by using Golgi&#x27;s method. Ramón y Cajal was also the first person to propose the physiological role of increasing the receptive surface area of the neuron. The greater the pyramidal cell&#x27;s surface area, the greater the neuron&#x27;s ability to process and integrate large amounts of information. Dendritic spines are absent on the soma, while the number increases away from it. The typical apical dendrite in a rat has at least 3,000 dendritic spines. The average human apical dendrite is approximately twice the length of a rat&#x27;s, so the number of dendritic spines present on a human apical dendrite could be as high as 6,000.

==Growth and development==

===Differentiation===

Pyramidal specification occurs during early development of the cerebrum. Progenitor cells are committed to the neuronal lineage in the subcortical proliferative ventricular zone (VZ) and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Immature pyramidal cells undergo migration to occupy the cortical plate, where they further diversify. Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are one class of molecules that have been shown to direct pyramidal cell development and axonal pathfinding. Transcription factors such as Ctip2 and Sox5 have been shown to contribute to the direction in which pyramidal neurons direct their axons.

===Early postnatal development===

Pyramidal cells in rats have been shown to undergo many rapid changes during early postnatal life. Between postnatal days 3 and 21, pyramidal cells have been shown to double the size of the soma, increase the length of the apical dendrite fivefold, and increase basal dendrite length thirteen-fold. Other changes include the lowering of the membrane&#x27;s resting potential, reduction of membrane resistance, and an increase in the peak values of action potentials.

==Signaling==

Like dendrites in most other neurons, the dendrites are generally the input areas of the neuron, while the axon is the neuron&#x27;s output. Both axons and dendrites are highly branched. The large amount of branching allows the neuron to send and receive signals to and from many different neurons.

Pyramidal neurons, like other neurons, have numerous voltage-gated ion channels. In pyramidal cells, there is an abundance of Na+, Ca2+, and K+ channels in the dendrites, and some channels in the soma. Ion channels within pyramidal cell dendrites have different properties from the same ion channel type within the pyramidal cell soma. Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in pyramidal cell dendrites are activated by subthreshold EPSPs and by back-propagating action potentials. The extent of back-propagation of action potentials within pyramidal dendrites depends upon the K+ channels. K+ channels in pyramidal cell dendrites provide a mechanism for controlling the amplitude of action potentials.

The ability of pyramidal neurons to integrate information depends on the number and distribution of the synaptic inputs they receive. A single pyramidal cell receives about 30,000 excitatory inputs and 1700 inhibitory (IPSPs) inputs. Excitatory (EPSPs) inputs terminate exclusively on the dendritic spines, while inhibitory (IPSPs) inputs terminate on dendritic shafts, the soma, and even the axon. Pyramidal neurons can be excited by the neurotransmitter glutamate, and inhibited by the neurotransmitter GABA.
===Firing classifications===
Pyramidal neurons have been classified into different subclasses based upon their firing responses to 400-1000 millisecond current pulses. These classification are RSad, RSna, and IB neurons.

====RSad====
RSad pyramidal neurons, or adapting regular spiking neurons, fire with individual action potentials (APs), which are followed by a hyperpolarizing afterpotential. The afterpotential increases in duration which creates spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in the neuron.

====RSna====
RSna pyramidal neurons, or non-adapting regular spiking neurons, fire a train of action potentials after a pulse. These neurons show no signs of adaptation.

====IB====
IB pyramidal neurons, or intrinsically bursting neurons, respond to threshold pulses with a burst of two to five rapid action potentials. IB pyramidal neurons show no adaptation.

=== Molecular classifications ===
There are several studies showing that morphological and electric pyramidal cells properties could be deduced from gene expression measured by single cell sequencing. Several studies are proposing that single cell classifications in mouse and human neurons based on gene expression could explain various neuronal properties . Neuronal types in these classifications are split into excitatory, inhibitory and hundreds of corresponding sub-types. For example, pyramidal cells of layer 2-3 in human are classified as FREM3 type and often have a high amount of Ih-current generated by HCN-channel.

== Function ==

===Corticospinal tract===

Pyramidal neurons are the primary neural cell type in the corticospinal tract. Normal motor control depends on the development of connections between the axons in the corticospinal tract and the spinal cord. Pyramidal cell axons follow cues such as growth factors to make specific connections. With proper connections, pyramidal cells take part in the circuitry responsible for vision guided motor function.

===Cognition===

Pyramidal neurons in the prefrontal cortex are implicated in cognitive ability. In mammals, the complexity of pyramidal cells increases from posterior to anterior brain regions. The degree of complexity of pyramidal neurons is likely linked to the cognitive capabilities of different anthropoid species. Pyramidal cells within the prefrontal cortex appear to be responsible for processing input from the primary auditory cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, and primary visual cortex, all of which process sensory modalities. These cells might also play a critical role in complex object recognition within the visual processing areas of the cortex. Relative to other species, the larger cell size and complexity of pyramidal neurons, along with certain patterns of cellular organization and function, correlates with the evolution of human cognition. 

=== Memory and learning ===
The hippocampus&#x27;s pyramidal cells are essential for certain types of memory and learning. They form synapses that aid in the integration of synaptic voltages throughout their complex dendritic trees through interactions with mossy fibers from granule cells. Since it affects the postsynaptic voltages produced by mossy fiber activation, the placement of thorny excrescences on basal and apical dendrites is important for memory formation. By enabling dynamic control of the sensitivity of CA3 pyramidal cells, this clustering of mossy fiber synapses on pyramidal cells may facilitate the initiation of somatic spikes.

The interactions between pyramidal cells and an estimated 41 mossy fiber boutons, each originating from a unique granule cell, highlight the role of these boutons in information processing and synaptic connectivity, which are essential for memory and learning. Fundamentally, mossy fiber input is received by pyramidal cells in the hippocampus which integrate synaptic voltages within their dendritic architecture. The location of prickly protrusions and the clustering of synapses influence sensitivity and contribute to the processing of information pertaining to memory and learning.

<text>The New York Euphoria was a women&#x27;s American football team that participated in the Lingerie Bowl, an alternative Super Bowl halftime event originally consisting of two teams of models and actresses wearing lingerie and minimal protective football gear. The team was established as Team Euphoria, one of two teams that participated in the inaugural Lingerie Bowl broadcast during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004. Team Euphoria was captained by Angie Everhart and were shutout the Nikki Ziering-captained Team Dream with a single touchdown scored, losing the inaugural event 6–0.

In the following year, the team was renamed New York Euphoria and the event was expanded by two more teams, the Dallas Desire and Chicago Bliss. After defeating the Chicago Bliss in the Eastern Final (a semifinal competition that included a skill test, a 3-on-2 match, and a dance competition), they met again with the former Team Dream, renamed Los Angeles Temptation, at the final of Lingerie Bowl II and lost again. In 2006, they defeated the Chicago Bliss again in the semifinal and then defeated the Temptation 13–12 in Lingerie Bowl III. The Lingerie Bowl was then cancelled for various reasons from 2007 through 2009.

The team was not carried over when the Lingerie Bowl organization formed the Lingerie Football League in 2009. Instead, New York was ostensibly represented by the New York Majesty, even though its home stadium was in Reading, Pennsylvania.

<text>A gazebo is a pavilion structure, sometimes octagonal or turret-shaped, often built in a park, garden, or spacious public area. Some are used on occasions as bandstands.

The name is also now used for a tent like canopy structure with open sides used as partial shelter from sun and rain at outdoor events.

==Etymology==

The etymology given by Oxford Dictionaries is &quot;Mid 18th century: perhaps humorously from gaze, in imitation of Latin future tenses ending in -ebo: compare with lavabo.&quot; L. L. Bacon put forward a derivation from &quot;Casbah&quot;, a Muslim quarter around the citadel in Algiers. W. Sayers proposed Hispano-Arabic &quot;qushaybah&quot;, in a poem by Cordoban poet Ibn Quzman (d. 1160).

The word &quot;gazebo&quot; appears in a mid-18th century English book by the architects John and William Halfpenny: &quot;Rural Architecture in the Chinese Taste&quot;. There Plate 55, &quot;Elevation of a Chinese Gazebo&quot;, shows &quot;a Chinese Tower or Gazebo, situated on a Rock, and raised to a considerable Height, and a Gallery round it to render the Prospect more complete.&quot;

George Washington had a small eight-sided garden structure at Mount Vernon. Thomas Jefferson wrote about gazebos, then called summerhouses or pavilions.

==Design==
Gazebos are freestanding or attached to a garden wall, roofed, and are often open on all sides. They provide shade, shelter from rain and a place to rest, while acting as an ornamental feature. Some gazebos in public parks are large enough to serve as a bandstand.

==Types==
Gazebos overlap with pavilions, kiosks, belvederes, follies, gloriettes, pergolas, and rotundas.

Such structures first appeared in Egyptian gardens approximately 5,000 years ago and appear in the literature of China, Persia and other classical civilizations.

Examples in England are the garden houses at Montacute House in Somerset. The gazebo at Elton on the Hill in Nottinghamshire, thought to date from the late 18th or early 19th century, is a square, crenelated, brick and stone tower with an arched opening. It acted as a focus for an extensive system of red-brick walled gardens, which has survived with some more modern additions.

In today&#x27;s England and North America, gazebos are typically built of wood and covered with standard roofing materials, such as shingles. Gazebos can be tent-style structures of poles covered by tensioned fabric. Gazebos may have screens to aid in the exclusion of flying insects.

Temporary gazebos are often set up in the campsites of music festivals in the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States, usually accompanying tents around them.

A structure resembling a gazebo, found in villages in the Maldives, is known as a &quot;holhuashi&quot;.

<doc id="627957" wikidata="Q595592" url="?curid=627957" title="Okun's law">
<text>In economics, Okun&#x27;s law is an empirically observed relationship between unemployment and losses in a country&#x27;s production. It is named after Arthur Melvin Okun, who first proposed the relationship in 1962. The &quot;gap version&quot; states that for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate, a country&#x27;s GDP will be roughly an additional 2% lower than its potential GDP. The &quot;difference version&quot; describes the relationship between quarterly changes in unemployment and quarterly changes in real GDP. The stability and usefulness of the law has been disputed.

==Imperfect relationship==
Okun&#x27;s law is an empirical relationship. In Okun&#x27;s original statement of his law, a 2% increase in output corresponds to a 1% decline in the rate of cyclical unemployment; a 0.5% increase in labor force participation; a 0.5% increase in hours worked per employee; and a 1% increase in output per hours worked (labor productivity).

Okun&#x27;s law states that a one-point increase in the cyclical unemployment rate is associated with two percentage points of negative growth in real GDP. The relationship varies depending on the country and time period under consideration.

The relationship has been tested by regressing GDP or GNP growth on change in the unemployment rate. Martin Prachowny estimated about a 3% decrease in output for every 1% increase in the unemployment rate. However, he argued that the majority of this change in output is actually due to changes in factors other than unemployment, such as capacity utilization and hours worked. Holding these other factors constant reduces the association between unemployment and GDP to around 0.7% for every 1% change in the unemployment rate. The magnitude of the decrease seems to be declining over time in the United States. According to Andrew Abel and Ben Bernanke, estimates based on data from more recent years give about a 2% decrease in output for every 1% increase in unemployment.

There are several reasons why GDP may increase or decrease more rapidly than unemployment decreases or increases:

As unemployment increases,
* a reduction in the multiplier effect created by the circulation of money from employees
* unemployed persons may drop out of the labor force (stop seeking work), after which they are no longer counted in unemployment statistics
* employed workers may work shorter hours
* labor productivity may decrease, perhaps because employers retain more workers than they need
One implication of Okun&#x27;s law is that an increase in labor productivity or an increase in the size of the labor force can mean that real net output grows without net unemployment rates falling (the phenomenon of &quot;jobless growth&quot;)

Okun&#x27;s Law is sometimes confused with Lucas wedge.

==Mathematical statements==
The gap version of Okun&#x27;s law may be written (Abel &amp; Bernanke 2005) as:

:formula_1, where
* formula_2 is actual output
* formula_3 is potential GDP
* formula_4 is actual unemployment rate
* formula_5 is the natural rate of unemployment
* formula_6 is the factor relating changes in unemployment to changes in output

In the United States since 1955 or so, the value of c has typically been around 2 or 3, as explained above.

The gap version of Okun&#x27;s law, as shown above, is difficult to use in practice because formula_3 and formula_5
can only be estimated, not measured. A more commonly used form of Okun&#x27;s law, known as the difference or growth rate form of
Okun&#x27;s law, relates changes in output to changes in unemployment:

:formula_9, where:
* formula_2 and formula_6 are as defined above
* formula_12 is the change in actual output from one year to the next
* formula_13 is the change in actual unemployment from one year to the next
* formula_14 is the average annual growth rate of full-employment output

At the present time in the United States, &quot;k&quot; is about 3% and &quot;c&quot; is about 2, so the equation may be written

:formula_15

The graph at the top of this article illustrates the growth rate form of Okun&#x27;s law, measured quarterly rather than annually.

==Derivation of the growth rate form==
We start with the first form of Okun&#x27;s law:
:formula_16
:formula_17
Taking annual differences on both sides, we obtain
:formula_18
Putting both numerators over a common denominator, we obtain
:formula_19
Multiplying the left hand side by formula_20, which is approximately equal to 1, we obtain
:formula_21
:formula_22
We assume that formula_23, the change in the natural rate of unemployment, is approximately equal to 0. We also assume that formula_24, the growth rate of full-employment output, is approximately equal to its average value, formula_14. So we finally obtain
:formula_26

==Usefulness ==

Through comparisons between actual data and theoretical forecasting, Okun&#x27;s law proves to be an invaluable tool in predicting trends between unemployment and real GDP. However, the accuracy of the data theoretically proved through Okun&#x27;s law compared to real world numbers proves to be generally inaccurate. This is due to the variances in Okun&#x27;s coefficient. Many, including the Reserve Bank of Australia, conclude that information proved by Okun&#x27;s law to be acceptable to a certain degree. Also, some findings have concluded that Okun&#x27;s law tends to have higher rates of accuracy for short-run predictions, rather than long-run predictions. Forecasters have concluded this to be true due to unforeseen market conditions that may affect Okun&#x27;s coefficient.

As such, Okun&#x27;s law is generally acceptable by forecasters as a tool for short-run trend analysis between unemployment and real GDP, rather than being used for long run analysis as well as accurate numerical calculations.

The San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank determined through the use of empirical data from past recessions in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s that Okun’s law was a useful theory. All recessions showed two common main trends: a counterclockwise loop for both real-time and revised data. The recoveries of the 1990s and 2000s did have smaller and tighter loops.

<doc id="627961" wikidata="Q632980" url="?curid=627961" title="Emergency brake (train)">
<text>On trains, the expression emergency brake has several meanings:
* The &quot;maximum&quot; brake force available to the engine driver from the conventional braking system, usually operated by taking the brake handle to its furthest position, through a gate mechanism, or by pushing a separate plunger in the cab.
* A completely separate mechanism from the conventional braking system, designed to stop the train as quickly as possible.
* A handle or plunger which may be applied by a passenger in an emergency, either stopping the train directly or sending an alarm to the driver so that they can stop the train.

Industry vernacular for when the emergency brake is applied is go into emergency, as in phrases like &quot;the train may fail to go into emergency&quot; or &quot;the ability of the train to go into
emergency is paramount&quot;.

The emergency brake applies considerably more braking force than the standard full-service brake. The engine driver or motorman will only use the emergency brake as a last resort, since it may cause damage; even with modern wheel slide protection, a train may develop wheel-flats, and the rails themselves can suffer profile damage.

==Possible consequences of operation==
Putting the engine driver&#x27;s brake handle into the emergency position may also:
* Shut off traction power
* On an electric train, drop the pantograph if the power supply is overhead-wire traction current, or raise the pickup shoes where the supply is third rail traction current
* Disable dynamic braking
* Prevent the brakes from being released until the train has stopped
* Connect the brake wires to ground, to prevent a &quot;false-feed&quot; voltage from releasing the brakes
* Send an emergency radio signal, if the brake handle has been in the emergency position for over 30 seconds
*Activate the sander
*Activate the train horn until the selector is placed out of the emergency position

==Passenger-applied brakes==
Trains often have a facility in each car to enable passengers to apply the brakes in case of emergency. In many modern trains, the driver is able to prevent brake activation when a passenger operates the emergency alarm - an audible warning is sounded, and the driver is then able to talk to the person who activated the alarm on the intercom and see them on an internal CCTV. The driver can press an override button and hold the brakes off whilst they choose a safe place to stop the train. Because of possible serious problems, severe fines and/or imprisonment penalties are in place to deter people from activating the brake without good reason.

===Mechanism on locomotive-hauled stock with brake pipe===
The alarm chain in a passenger coach is designed to create a break in the continuity of the brake pipes (whether vacuum or air brakes), immediately resulting in a loss of brake pressure (or vacuum) and thereby causing the train brakes to be applied. With vacuum brakes, a clappet valve is provided, which is released by the pulling of the alarm chain; with air brakes, there is a similar passenger emergency valve which can vent the brake pipe to the air.

In most locomotives (in addition to a warning lamp or buzzer being sounded) the master controller undergoes auto-regression, with the notches falling to zero rapidly as the locomotive&#x27;s motive power is switched off. The guard may also notice the loss of brake pressure (although they may not know it is due to the pulling of the alarm chain) and is expected to apply their brakes immediately as well. It is possible for a driver to override the alarm-chain pull; this is sometimes done where it is known that miscreants resort to pulling the emergency chain solely to get the train to stop at a point convenient for themselves. However, such an act by the driver (or guard) of deliberately ignoring an indication of alarm-chain pulling is a serious matter.

In recent years locomotives have been fitted with emergency flashers on the roof of the cab, and these flashers are also activated when the brake pipe pressure is lost for any reason other than the driver&#x27;s application of the brake valve. This alerts drivers of oncoming trains of the possibility of a derailed or parted rake which may foul other tracks (since brake pressure may have been lost for those reasons as well); at the locomotive, it is not possible to tell whether the loss of brake pressure is due to the pulling of the alarm chain.

ACP (alarm chain pulling) also causes a small lever to be released near the emergency brake valve (usually mounted near one end of the coach), which does not retract to its normal position even when the chain is released. This allows the driver (or guard) to find out in which coach the ACP actually occurred. When the coach is isolated, the lever needs to be manually reset. Until this is done, the lamp and buzzer in the locomotive cab are continuously activated. A circuit breaker controls the lamp and alarm bell in the locomotive cab; in cases where defective equipment causes the lamp and bell to go off, the driver can disable them by placing the MCB (miniature circuit breaker) in the &quot;Off&quot; position. Despite the obvious safety hazards, sometimes this is resorted to by drivers when driving trains through sections where spurious ACP incidents are very common.

==Around the world==

===Germany===

The Regelung B009 NBÜ Rev 3.1 defines a set of nested state machines in the chapter &quot;“Anlage 1: Phasen einer Zugfahrt“&quot;, reflecting a very wide range of use cases, including platforms, tunnels, etc. and is applicable for subways, trams, metros(S-Bahn), as it implements appropriate actions for all use cases occurring in rail transportation. These state machines represents the state of the art in Germany, it is highly recommended to be implemented or retrofitted to avoid the problems experienced at the S-Bahn Rhine-Neckar.

In Germany, passenger vehicles “must have easily visible and reachable emergency brake handles”. It is allowed that the emergency brake can be reset, on S-Bahn vehicles (i.e. Classes 420, 423, 425, 480 or 481) it&#x27;s allowed to only result in a display when used outside of platforms. The implementation of the S-Bahn&#x27;s emergency brake however does currently not reflect the state of the art in Germany, it has failed in practical use at least in one instance 2015, as a driver lost consciousness completely, but still accidentally triggered the vigilance device. Unlike the System NBÜ2004, which is used in conventional trains, the brake was not activated, because it is only an indicator light and a sound, while the train is running on the track. Without ATP enabled or over-speed, the described incident may have been leading to fatalities and substantial damage, as the passengers noticed the unconscious driver, but could not stop the train by pulling the emergency-brake-handle. Using the NBÜ2004, as used in regional- and long-distance-trains, this would have been prevented, a &quot;overwrite&quot; response is needed, typically the &quot;FÜ&quot;(Filling) position of the automatic brake-lever, otherwise the trains brake-computer will perform an emergency-brake after 10 seconds.

Equipment for this override (NBÜ) is necessary in tunnels above 1000 m. For regional trains, UIC 541-5 is not sufficient since 2011, long distance trains must at least be equipped with UIC 541-5. The sections where not to stop are marked with yellow bars on the kilometer signs. Regional trains, except MUs, are usually equipped with NBÜ 2004, which results in a display and a break a few seconds later if the train driver doesn&#x27;t respond. For DB Regio, the rules for the staff are given in Ril 494. Long distance trains are mostly equipped with system DB, which uses the UIC 558 control wire, which results in conflicts with some door control systems and is therefore not used in regional trains. In MUs, usually a special implementation is used.

For trams, emergency brakes are also necessary. In tunnels and track sections without safety area, using them outside a station may stop the tram at the next platform instead of immediately.

===India===
&quot;Chain-pulling&quot; is the act of pulling a cord that activates the train&#x27;s emergency brakes to stop a train, whether for a genuine emergency or (often) illegally for someone to get on or off the train on the Indian Railways network. Illegal chain-pulling is a serious problem on Indian Railways; where miscreants do so to make unscheduled stops near their destination, which delays trains. Penalties for misuse of this facility include a fine of Rs. 1,000 and/or imprisonment up to one year. In an effort to improve the service, former President of India Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam proposed an alternate method wherein a passenger in an emergency communicates with the guard and driver of the train.

===United States===

In the USA, an emergency stop cord is not used. Any visible cord running within the body of a railway car would have been what was known as the &quot;communicating cord&quot;. This was a method of signalling the engine operator (known in the US as the &quot;engineer&quot;). Unlike other countries, it was never intended for use by passengers. It had its own code of signals, similar to engine whistle signals. Drivers receiving an unusual, or unidentifiable, communicating signal might stop the train, perhaps as a &quot;normal stop&quot; or an &quot;emergency application&quot;, at their discretion. A long, continuous signal would usually prompt a driver to make an emergency stop. Emergency brake valves are always located on the bulkheads, inside the body of the car next to its end doors. The emergency brake valve is covered by a metal or clear plastic shield labelled &quot;Emergency Only&quot;. Sometimes there was also a communicating signal handle on the inside bulkhead, labelled &quot;signal&quot;. 

Mistakenly identifying the communication cord as the emergency brake can lead to confusion about how emergency braking works on US trains. Once an emergency brake valve is opened, all of the air in the braking system, except those of the locomotive(s), which are equipped with brakes controlled separately (independent brake) from those of the cars, is evacuated, immediately placing the train cars&#x27; brakes into emergency, just as if there had been an uncoupling of cars (a &quot;separation&quot;). All available pressure from the Equalizing Reservoir will go into the brake pipe, thus running the length of the train, actuating the train brakes on each car. No action is required (or even possible) on the part of the engineer. The train will stop no matter what they do, and there is no override. Once the train has stopped, the braking system will not recharge (pressurize) until the emergency valve has been closed. This means a member of the train crew must locate the open valve, and ascertain that there is no problem which would make it unsafe to release the brakes and proceed. 

Identification of the valve is possible by the sound of air escaping from it. In many cars (and practically all cars built post-WWII), the communicating cord was only located in the vestibule, unless the car was of such a type that it did not have a vestibule, such as a dining or lounge car. In newer Amtrak equipment, the air-operated communicating system was electrified, and operated by pressing a button located in the vestibule. The old communication systems have been gradually supplanted by radios, although they were still required on US passenger equipment until relatively recently. The emergency brake valve continues to be located on the inside bulkhead, or in a consistent (standard) location specified by safety regulations. A member of the train crew must walk the length of the train and inspect it for any damage. The consist will need to be inspected before it can return to normal revenue service.

In the cabs of light-rail cars, the emergency brake is often a large red button, which the train crew refers to as the &quot;mushroom&quot;; this also activates the magnetic track brakes. The mechanism of an emergency brake may differ, depending on railcar design. Emergency-braking a train (without track brakes) will give about deceleration. The braking distance will be approximately at and at . High-speed trains are usually equipped with a magnetic track brake, which can give about 0.3 m/s2 extra, and give braking distances of about at and at .

=== United Kingdom ===

Emergency brakes were introduced in the United Kingdom by the Regulation of Railways Act 1868. Section 22 stated, &quot;All trains traveling a distance of more than 20 miles without stopping are to be provided with a means of communication between the passengers and the servants of the company in charge of the train&quot;. At first, this means of communication was a cord running down the length of the train at roof level outside the carriages, connected to a bell on the locomotive. When the use of automatic brakes was made compulsory in the Regulation of Railways Act 1889, the equipment was modified so that it operated the brakes; however, the term &quot;communication cord&quot; has survived. Until the 1970s a &quot;cord&quot; (by that time a chain) was still used, which ran the length of the carriage and connected to a valve at one end which opened the brake pipe. The exposed section of chain was painted red, with the coiled section behind the wall painted black. The system was designed so that as the black length of chain was exposed, it would not retract so as to identify which particular chain in that carriage was pulled. A butterfly valve on the side of the carriage was used to reset the brake, and also made it easy for the train crew to see in which coach the cord had been pulled. Later designs used handles which were activated by pulling down; more recent types use buttons connected to a PassComm system. On modern trains with sliding doors the body-indicator light (BIL), usually used to show that doors on a carriage are open, will flash when the brake has been used.

Pulling the alarm chain on a British train will pull a lever connected to the brake pipe flaps. Pulling the alarm activates a piston, causing the flaps to be opened and all the air pushed out the air tube, forcing the brakes on. In the driver&#x27;s cab, a buzzer and a light will tell that the alarm has been activated. In the guard&#x27;s van, this is seen from a valve which shows loss of pressure in the brake pipe. In the UK, there is a fine (of level 3 on the standard scale: up to £1000 as of 2018) for pulling the alarm chain without reasonable cause.

==== Override ====
In most rolling stock built since the 1980s, passenger communication handles (or PassComms) have been installed, which activate an alarm in the driver&#x27;s cab when used. If the train is not in a safe place (in a tunnel or on a bridge, for example) the driver has approximately three seconds to override the alarm by pressing a button before the brakes automatically apply. The driver may also speak to the person who pulled the handle via an intercom mounted alongside the handle. On modern trains this is particularly useful, since the PassComm must be much easier to use and more accessible due to accessibility regulations. However this also makes accidental activation easier. On some modern trains, the PassComm in a disabled-friendly toilet is mounted such that it is often confused with the door or flush control; this sometimes leads to accidental activation. As a result, on some models of train such as the Class 180, the alarm panels fitted in the toilets do not operate the train brake, and simply alert the train crew to the emergency.

==== London Underground ====
When London Underground began converting trains for one-person-operation during the 1970s and 1980s, the original emergency brake systems were replaced by an alarm and a passenger-communication system. On earlier systems the brakes were not applied automatically (being under the control of the driver), whereas later systems have an override as above. On older systems, marker boards showing an exclamation mark were provided on departure from each station at the point where the rear of the train would no longer be at the platform. Normally, if the alarm was activated before the board the driver would stop the train, and otherwise continue to the next station. These boards were replaced by a number of boards counting up the number of cars that are beyond the end of the platform; for example, on a line with six-car trains the boards show 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. When a train has stopped, they help the driver to see how much of the train is at the platform. With the help of passenger communication and available station staff, the driver can then decide whether to deal with the situation as it is, continue to the next station or possibly reverse back into the station (after consulting with line controllers and proper safety measures). During hot summer weather passengers are warned against using the emergency alarms if feeling unwell, since it can delay trains and increase the problem; they are instead instructed to leave the train at the next station and get some fresh air or a cold drink.

=== Russia ===
In Russian trains there is usually an emergency brake known as a &quot;stop valve&quot; (). In elektrichkas and other trains it is usually located near the doors, and sometimes in the middle of the coach as well. A stop valve usually has a distinctive red handle. Turning the handle down (anti-clockwise) by about 90 degrees causes pneumatic brakes to engage, due to pressure loss in the standard air-braking system. While primitive and not allowing any override such a system is effective, resembling usual train brake activation; it does not fail in emergency conditions. More complicated systems may not provide quick braking when needed, or during a communications failure. Emergency braking is somewhat risky; it is hard on passengers, and there is a risk of passenger injury if braking occurs at high speed. As a result, use of a stop valve without good reason is prohibited and may lead to fines. Depending on circumstances and consequences, authorities may even arrest a person for the incorrect use of a stop valve.

==== Subways ====
In subways, derailment is usually less dangerous (speeds are lower, trains cannot jackknife in tunnels and so on). It is dangerous to stop in a tunnel if a fire develops; an emergency exit could lead to electrocution by the third rail (typically energized with 825 volts DC). Instead drivers try to reach the next station, even in an emergency. As a result, there are no emergency brakes directly visible to passengers. However, there are hidden stop valves and simplified train controls, allowing each coach to act on its own in need. In an emergency, there are door-control handles (visible to passengers) which are intended to make the pneumatic train doors able to be opened by removing air pressure. Subway trains have mechanisms and alarms which prevent trains from moving if the doors are open, and alert the driver or engage the brakes if doors open while a train is moving. Penalties for misuse of emergency door-opening handles are similar to those for stop-valve misuse.

===Japan===

In many Japanese passenger and freight trains, an EB reset switch is provided which is activated by sounding a buzzer and lighting up the EB reset switch when the driver does not operate the controls within 60 seconds of last operation (30 seconds on Aonami Line, 40 seconds on JR Kyushu lines). If the EB switch is not pressed (reset) within 5 seconds of being activated, it will trigger an emergency brake application so as to prevent accidents due to driver error or when the driver is incapacitated. Also, a red button and/or an emergency brake setting on the levers are provided in the driver&#x27;s cab so the driver can manually activate the emergency brake; these can also be activated (like a dead man&#x27;s handle) when the driver feels unwell or is incapacitated in trains without the EB reset switch. Near train doors, emergency brake cords are available so that passengers can bring the train to a halt in an emergency.

== External signalling ==
In the US, the universally recognized signal to stop is a sweeping, horizontal hand motion, back-and-forth, at arm&#x27;s length and perpendicular to the track (preferably in a downward direction, so as to distinguish it from a mere greeting). This can be done with an object (such as a light or flag) or an empty hand. In US railroad slang it is referred to as a &quot;washout&quot;, or &quot;washing out&quot; signal, or a &quot;signing down&quot;, and requires an immediate stop. If the driver&#x27;s vision is limited, or they feel it necessary, they will make an emergency stop. Drivers are trained to interpret any urgent waving or signalling by a person near the track as a possible warning of danger, perhaps requiring an immediate stop, depending upon the particular circumstances present.

<doc id="627964" wikidata="Q721322" url="?curid=627964" title="Survival of the fittest">
<text>&quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; is a phrase that originated from Darwinian evolutionary theory as a way of describing the mechanism of natural selection. The biological concept of fitness is defined as reproductive success. In Darwinian terms, the phrase is best understood as &quot;survival of the form that in successive generations will leave most copies of itself.&quot;

Herbert Spencer first used the phrase, after reading Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, in his &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; (1864), in which he drew parallels between his own economic theories and Darwin&#x27;s biological ones: &quot;This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called &#x27;natural selection&#x27;, or the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for life.&quot;

Darwin responded positively to Alfred Russel Wallace&#x27;s suggestion of using Spencer&#x27;s new phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as an alternative to &quot;natural selection&quot;, and adopted the phrase in &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot; published in 1868. In &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, he introduced the phrase in the fifth edition published in 1869, intending it to mean &quot;better designed for an immediate, local environment&quot;.

==History of the phrase==
By his own account, Herbert Spencer described a concept similar to &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in his 1852 &quot;A Theory of Population&quot;. He first used the phrase – after reading Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; – in his &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; of 1864 in which he drew parallels between his economic theories and Darwin&#x27;s biological, evolutionary ones, writing, &quot;This survival of the fittest, which I have here sought to express in mechanical terms, is that which Mr. Darwin has called &#x27;natural selection&#x27;, or the preservation of favored races in the struggle for life.&quot;

In July 1866 Alfred Russel Wallace wrote to Darwin about readers thinking that the phrase &quot;natural selection&quot; personified nature as &quot;selecting&quot; and said this misconception could be avoided &quot;by adopting Spencer&#x27;s term&quot; &quot;Survival of the fittest&quot;. Darwin promptly replied that Wallace&#x27;s letter was &quot;as clear as daylight. I fully agree with all that you say on the advantages of H. Spencer&#x27;s excellent expression of &#x27;the survival of the fittest&#x27;. This however had not occurred to me till reading your letter. It is, however, a great objection to this term that it cannot be used as a substantive governing a verb&quot;. Had he received the letter two months earlier, he would have worked the phrase into the fourth edition of the &quot;Origin&quot; which was then being printed, and he would use it in his next book on &quot;Domestic Animals etc.&quot;.

Darwin wrote on page 6 of &quot;The Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication&quot; published in 1868, &quot;This preservation, during the battle for life, of varieties which possess any advantage in structure, constitution, or instinct, I have called Natural Selection; and Mr. Herbert Spencer has well expressed the same idea by the Survival of the Fittest. The term &#x27;natural selection&#x27; is in some respects a bad one, as it seems to imply conscious choice; but this will be disregarded after a little familiarity&quot;. He defended his analogy as similar to language used in chemistry, and to astronomers depicting the &quot;attraction of gravity as ruling the movements of the planets&quot;, or the way in which &quot;agriculturists speak of man making domestic races by his power of selection&quot;. He had &quot;often personified the word Nature; for I have found it difficult to avoid this ambiguity; but I mean by nature only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws,—and by laws only the ascertained sequence of events.&quot;

In the first four editions of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, Darwin had used the phrase &quot;natural selection&quot;. In Chapter 4 of the 5th edition of &quot;The Origin&quot; published in 1869, Darwin implies again the synonym: &quot;Natural Selection, or the Survival of the Fittest&quot;. By &quot;fittest&quot; Darwin meant &quot;better adapted for the immediate, local environment&quot;, not the common modern meaning of &quot;in the best physical shape&quot; (think of a puzzle piece, not an athlete). In the introduction he gave full credit to Spencer, writing &quot;I have called this principle, by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection, in order to mark its relation to man&#x27;s power of selection. But the expression often used by Mr. Herbert Spencer of the Survival of the Fittest is more accurate, and is sometimes equally convenient.&quot;

In &quot;The Man Versus The State&quot;, Spencer used the phrase in a postscript to justify a plausible explanation of how his theories would not be adopted by &quot;societies of militant type&quot;. He uses the term in the context of societies at war, and the form of his reference suggests that he is applying a general principle:

 &quot;Thus by survival of the fittest, the militant type of society becomes characterized by profound confidence in the governing power, joined with a loyalty causing submission to it in all matters whatever&quot;.

Though Spencer&#x27;s conception of organic evolution is commonly interpreted as a form of Lamarckism, Herbert Spencer is sometimes credited with inaugurating Social Darwinism.

Evolutionary biologists criticise the manner in which the term is used by non-scientists and the connotations that have grown around the term in popular culture. The phrase also does not help in conveying the complex nature of natural selection, so modern biologists prefer and almost exclusively use the term natural selection. The biological concept of fitness refers to both reproductive success (fecundity selection), as well as survival (viability selection) and is not prescriptive in the specific ways in which organisms can be more &quot;fit&quot; by having phenotypic characteristics that enhance survival and reproduction (which was the meaning that Spencer had in mind).

== Critiquing the phrase ==
While the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; is often used to mean &quot;natural selection&quot;, it is avoided by modern biologists, because the phrase can be misleading. For example, survival is only one aspect of selection, and not always the most important. Another problem is that the word &quot;fit&quot; is frequently confused with a state of physical fitness. In the evolutionary meaning, &quot;fitness&quot; is the rate of reproductive output among a class of genetic variants.

==Interpreted as expressing a biological theory==
The phrase can also be interpreted to express a theory or hypothesis: that &quot;fit&quot; as opposed to &quot;unfit&quot; individuals or species, in some sense of &quot;fit&quot;, will survive some test. Nevertheless, when extended to individuals it is a conceptual mistake, the phrase is a reference to the &quot;transgenerational&quot; survival of the heritable attributes; particular individuals are quite irrelevant. This becomes clearer when referring to Viral quasispecies, in &quot;survival of the flattest&quot;, which makes it clear &quot;to survive&quot; makes no reference to the question of even being alive itself; rather the functional capacity of proteins to carry out work.

Interpretations of the phrase as expressing a theory are in danger of being tautological, meaning roughly &quot;those with a propensity to survive have a propensity to survive&quot;; to have content the theory must use a concept of fitness that is independent of that of survival.

Interpreted as a theory of species survival, the theory that the fittest species survive is undermined by evidence that while direct competition is observed between individuals, populations and species, there is little evidence that competition has been the driving force in the evolution of large groups such as, for example, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals. Instead, these groups have evolved by expanding into empty ecological niches. In the punctuated equilibrium model of environmental and biological change, the factor determining survival is often not superiority over another in competition but ability to survive dramatic changes in environmental conditions, such as after a meteor impact energetic enough to greatly change the environment globally.

In 2010 Sahney et al. argued that there is little evidence that intrinsic, biological factors such as competition have been the driving force in the evolution of large groups. Instead, they cited extrinsic, abiotic factors such as expansion as the driving factor on a large evolutionary scale. The rise of dominant groups such as amphibians, reptiles, mammals and birds occurred by opportunistic expansion into empty ecological niches and the extinction of groups happened due to large shifts in the abiotic environment.

==Interpreted as expressing a moral theory==

===Social Darwinists===
The use of the term &quot;social Darwinism&quot; as a critique of capitalist ideologies was introduced in Richard Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Social Darwinism in American Thought&quot; published in 1944.

===Anarchists===
Russian zoologist and anarchist Peter Kropotkin viewed the concept of &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; as supporting co-operation rather than competition. In his book &quot;Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution&quot; he set out his analysis leading to the conclusion that the fittest was not necessarily the best at competing individually, but often the community made up of those best at working together. He concluded that: In the animal world we have seen that the vast majority of species live in societies, and that they find in association the best arms for the struggle for life: understood in its wide Darwinian sense – not as a struggle for the sheer means of existence, but as a struggle against all natural conditions unfavourable to the species. The animal species, in which individual struggle has been reduced to its narrowest limits, and the practice of mutual aid has attained the greatest development, are invariably the most numerous, the most prosperous, and the most open to further progress.

Applying this concept to human society, Kropotkin presented mutual aid as one of the dominant factors of evolution, the other being self-assertion, and concluded that: In the practice of mutual aid, which we can retrace to the earliest beginnings of evolution, we thus find the positive and undoubted origin of our ethical conceptions; and we can affirm that in the ethical progress of man, mutual support not mutual struggle – has had the leading part. In its wide extension, even at the present time, we also see the best guarantee of a still loftier evolution of our race.

==Tautology==

&quot;Survival of the fittest&quot; is sometimes claimed to be a tautology. The reasoning is that if one takes the term &quot;fit&quot; to mean &quot;endowed with phenotypic characteristics which improve chances of survival and reproduction&quot; (which is roughly how Spencer understood it), then &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; can simply be rewritten as &quot;survival of those who are better equipped for surviving&quot;. Furthermore, the expression &quot;does&quot; become a tautology if one uses the most widely accepted definition of &quot;fitness&quot; in modern biology, namely reproductive success itself (rather than any set of characters conducive to this reproductive success). This reasoning is sometimes used to claim that Darwin&#x27;s entire theory of evolution by natural selection is fundamentally tautological, and therefore devoid of any explanatory power.

However, the expression &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; (taken on its own and out of context) gives a very incomplete account of the mechanism of natural selection. The reason is that it does not mention a key requirement for natural selection, namely the requirement of &quot;heritability&quot;. It is true that the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;, in and by itself, is a tautology if fitness is defined by survival and reproduction. Natural selection is the portion of variation in reproductive success that is caused by &quot;heritable&quot; characters (see the article on natural selection).

If certain heritable characters increase or decrease the chances of survival and reproduction of their bearers, then it follows mechanically (by definition of &quot;heritable&quot;) that those characters that improve survival and reproduction will increase in frequency over generations. This is precisely what is called &quot;evolution by natural selection&quot;. On the other hand, if the characters which lead to differential reproductive success are not heritable, then no meaningful evolution will occur, &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; or not: if improvement in reproductive success is caused by traits that are not heritable, then there is no reason why these traits should increase in frequency over generations. In other words, natural selection does not simply state that &quot;survivors survive&quot; or &quot;reproducers reproduce&quot;; rather, it states that &quot;survivors survive, reproduce and &quot;therefore&quot; propagate any &quot;heritable&quot; characters which have affected their survival and reproductive success&quot;. This statement is not tautological: it hinges on the testable hypothesis that such fitness-impacting heritable variations actually exist (a hypothesis that has been amply confirmed.)

Momme von Sydow suggested further definitions of &#x27;survival of the fittest&#x27; that may yield a testable meaning in biology and also in other areas where Darwinian processes have been influential. However, much care would be needed to disentangle tautological from testable aspects. Moreover, an &quot;implicit shifting between a testable and an untestable interpretation can be an illicit tactic to immunize natural selection ... while conveying the impression that one is concerned with testable hypotheses&quot;.

Skeptic Society founder and &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine publisher Michael Shermer addresses the tautology problem in his 1997 book, &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things&quot;, in which he points out that although tautologies are sometimes the beginning of science, they are never the end, and that scientific principles like natural selection are testable and falsifiable by virtue of their predictive power. Shermer points out, as an example, that population genetics accurately demonstrate when natural selection will and will not effect change on a population. Shermer hypothesizes that if hominid fossils were found in the same geological strata as trilobites, it would be evidence against natural selection.

<text>Metoidioplasty, metaoidioplasty, or metaidoioplasty (informally called a meto or meta) is a female-to-male gender-affirming surgery.

Testosterone replacement therapy gradually enlarges the clitoris to a mean maximum size of (as the clitoris and the penis are developmentally homologous). In a metoidioplasty, the urethral plate and urethra are completely dissected from the clitoral corporeal bodies, then divided at the distal (far) end, and the testosterone-enlarged clitoris straightened out and elongated. A longitudinal vascularized island flap is configured and harvested from the dorsal skin of the clitoris, reversed to the ventral side, tubularized and an anastomosis (connection) is formed with the native urethra. The new urethral meatus is placed along the neophallus (newly formed penis) to the distal end and the skin of the neophallus and scrotum reconstructed using labia minora and majora flaps. The new neophallus ranges in size from (with an average of ) and has the approximate girth of a human adult thumb.

The term derives from &quot;meta-&quot; &quot;change&quot;, Ancient Greek , and &quot;-plasty&quot;, denoting surgical construction or modification.

==Operation==

===Alternative techniques===
Recent studies have introduced an operative technique known as extensive metoidioplasty. This method extensively detaches the clitoris, nearly completely detaching it from the pubic arch before its reattachment and elongation. Current studies show this method yielding penile lengths of , with 7 out of 10 patients able to obtain erections that are capable of penetrative intercourse. 

Extended metoidioplasty is a more recent technique which attempts to refine extensive metoidioplasty. Both methods work on the same principal of releasing, thereby exposing, more of the clitoris. A study on 17 patients a range of 4–9cm increase in phallic length. Penetration was possible for 4, and 2 had significant length and growth during erection, but had not attempted sexual intercourse yet. Both methods are considered experimental, and are only offered by a few surgeons.

==Complications==
Complications from metoidioplasty vary in severity. Minor complications may be resolved through minor supportive care, while more serious complications may require surgical correction. Like other surgical procedures, each metoidioplasty procedure comes with the possibility of complications such as pain, infection, bleeding, blood clots, and damage to surrounding tissues. There is also a risk of adverse reactions to anesthesia or other medications that are required for the procedure or post-operative period.

If urethral lengthening is performed, urethral complications such as urinary fistula may occur. Patients who experience postvoid incontinence or dribbling following surgery report their symptoms as resolved within three months.

Satisfaction rates among patients who undergo metoidioplasty are generally very high regarding both appearance and sexual satisfaction.

==Comparison with phalloplasty==
Metoidioplasty is technically simpler than phalloplasty, more affordable, and has fewer potential complications. However, phalloplasty patients are far more likely to be capable of sexual penetration (mainly due to size constraints) after they recover from surgery.

In a phalloplasty, a plastic surgeon fabricates a neopenis by autografting tissue from a donor site (such as from the patient&#x27;s back, arm or leg). A phalloplasty takes about 8–10 hours to complete (the first stage), and is generally followed by multiple (up to three) additional surgical procedures including glansplasty, scrotoplasty, testicular prosthesis, and/or penile implantation.

Metoidioplasty typically requires 2–3 hours to complete. Because the clitoris&#x27; erectile tissue functions normally, a prosthesis is unnecessary for erection (although the clitoris might not become as rigid as a penile erection). In nearly all cases, metoidioplasty patients can continue to have clitoral orgasms after surgery.

Note also, that the two alternative techniques are not mutually exclusive and phalloplasty extension of a metioidiplasic base neophallus is possible.
==History==
The first metoidioplasty was reported in 1973 and the term was coined in a 1989 paper.

<doc id="627972" wikidata="Q7458532" url="?curid=627972" title="Masculinizing surgery">
<text>Masculinizing gender-affirming surgery for transgender men or transmasculine non-binary people includes a variety of surgical procedures that alter anatomical traits to provide physical traits more comfortable to the trans man&#x27;s male identity and functioning.

Often used to refer to phalloplasty, metoidoplasty, or vaginectomy, sex reassignment surgery can also more broadly refer to many procedures an individual may have, such as male chest reconstruction, hysterectomy, or oophorectomy.

Gender-affirming surgery is usually preceded by beginning hormone treatment with testosterone.

== Chest reconstruction ==
Chest reconstruction (&quot;top surgery&quot;) can be an important component of transition in the transmasculine population that can substantially improve gender incongruence. This might be done as a step in the process of treating distress due to a difference between experienced or expressed gender and sex assigned at birth (gender dysphoria). The procedure can help transgender men transition physically to their self-affirmed gender. Surgeries for female-to-male transgender patients have similarities to gynecomastia surgeries for cisgender men, breast reduction surgery for gigantomastia, and the separate mastectomies done for breast cancer.
Top surgery involves more than a mastectomy for the treatment of breast cancer. Special techniques are used to contour and reduce the chest wall, position the nipples and areola, and minimize scarring.

If the breast size is small, surgery that spares the skin, nipple and areola (subcutaneous nipple-sparing mastectomy) may be performed. This procedure minimizes scarring, has a faster healing time and usually preserves sensation in the nipples. During this surgery, incisions are made around the borders of the areolae and the surrounding skin. Breast tissue is removed through the incisions and some skin also might be removed. Remaining skin is reattached at the border of the areola.

Research suggests that most transgender men are satisfied with their surgical results, with only 1% experiencing regret after the operation.

== Hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ==
Hysterectomy is a surgical procedure performed to remove the uterus. A total hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus and cervix, and a sub-partial hysterectomy involves removal of only the uterus. Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) is the removal of both ovaries and fallopian tubes.

According to the ACOG, symptomatic uterine leiomyomas are the most common indication for hysterectomy in the US, followed by abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis and prolapse. Risk-reducing hysterectomy is also performed for patients with high-risk of endometrial cancer, including patients with germ-line BRCA1/2 mutations, Lynch Syndrome and family history. Hysterectomy can also be performed for male-identifying patients with uterus in conjunction with testosterone therapy.

Hysterectomy can be performed through three methods: abdominal, laparoscopic, vaginal. Abdominal hysterectomy is performed with incision into the abdominal wall, whereas laparoscopic and vaginal hysterectomies are minimally invasive procedures. Current ACOG guidelines recommend minimally invasive procedures, specifically vaginal hysterectomy, over surgical hysterectomy due to faster recovery time, shorter procedural time, shorter hospital stays and better quality of life. Discharge from minimally invasive hysterectomy can occur as fast as one day post-operation, in contrast to five days post-operation for abdominal hysterectomies. Following discharge, patients often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as constipation or urinary tract infections, as well as vaginal bleeding or discharge. These symptoms should be temporary and resolve within six weeks. Follow-up visits with a gynecologist is recommended six-weeks following hysterectomy.

Follow-up care for male-identifying patients with uterus should still see a gynecologist for a check-up at least every three years. This is particularly the case for patients who:
* retain their vagina (whether before or after further genital reconstruction,)
* have a strong family history of cancers of the breast, ovary, or uterus (endometrium,)
* have a personal history of gynecological cancer or significant dysplasia on a Pap smear.
* develop vaginal bleeding post-operation and hormone therapy

Complications of hysterectomy involve infection, venous thromboembolic events, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tract injury and nerve injury. The most common of these complications is infection, which occurs at a rate of 10.5% of abdominal hysterectomy, 13% of vaginal hysterectomy and 9% of laparoscopic hysterectomy. There is also a low risk of long-term complications, which can include chronic pain, sexual dysfunction and bowel dysfunction.

== Genital reassignment ==
Also known as genital reconstructive procedures (GRT).

=== Phalloplasty ===
Phalloplasty is the process of constructing a penis using a flap (graft) from the patient&#x27;s arm, thigh, abdomen, or back. Compared to metoidioplasty, phalloplasty provides a larger penis which may more closely resemble a natal penis. A neophallus created through phalloplasty relies on penile implants to achieve erection. Sexual sensation varies in location and intensity, but is usually preserved at least at base of the penis, where the original clitoris was.

=== Metoidioplasty ===

Metoidioplasty is done after enlarging the clitoris using hormone replacement therapy, where a neophallus is constructed from the enlarged clitoris, with or without extending the urethra to allow urination while standing up. The labia majora are united to form a scrotum, where prosthetic testicles can be inserted. The new neophallus ranges in size from 4–10 cm (with an average of 5.7 cm) and has the approximate girth of a human adult thumb. Sexual sensation and erectile function are usually completely preserved. Specialized metoidioplasty penile implants may be an option in those who cannot achieve penetration during sex.

=== Penile implants ===
Penile implants are usually used in phalloplasty surgery due to the inability of the neophallus to achieve proper erection. The penile implants are used in cisgender men to treat erectile dysfunction, and in transgender men during female-to-male sex reassignment surgery. Although the same penile implant has been used for both cisgender and transgender men, specialized penile implants for transgender men were recently developed by Zephyr Surgical Implants (Switzerland), in both inflatable and malleable models. During phalloplasty, the tissue flap used to build the neophallus is wrapped around the implant either in the same surgery, or in separate surgeries. Penile implants are less commonly used in metoidioplasty due to how the process is done.

== Facial masculinization ==
Facial masculinization also alters anatomical features to achieve an appearance that aligns more closely with gender identity. This can be achieved surgically, which might entail reconstruction of the forehead, nose, upper lip, or chin. Non-surgical options include injections to alter the jawline and chin. Non-surgical methods can be combined with surgery or used alone when subtle changes are desired. In addition to alteration of facial structure, hair transplantation can be used to achieve more permanent masculine hair growth patterns such as sideburns, mustaches, or beards.

<text>Nanyang Sin-Chew Lianhe Zaobao, commonly abbreviated as Lianhe Zaobao, is the largest Singaporean Chinese-language newspaper with a daily circulation of about 136,900 (print and digital) as of 2021. Published by SPH Media (formerly Singapore Press Holdings), it was formed on 16 March 1983 as a result of a merger between the Singaporean editions of &quot;Nanyang Siang Pau&quot; and &quot;Sin Chew Jit Poh&quot;, two of Singapore&#x27;s oldest Chinese newspapers.

The paper establishes itself as a broadsheet with local news coverage, while international news tend to be largely centred on the East Asia region, with a section dedicated to China. &quot;Zaobao&quot; has an East Asian correspondent network spanning Beijing, Chongqing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Taipei, Seoul and Tokyo. It is SPH&#x27;s flagship Chinese daily and the only Chinese-language daily in Singapore. &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; is the only Chinese-language overseas newspaper which can be purchased in major cities of mainland China. As with all Chinese-language publications currently based in Singapore, the paper is printed in Simplified Chinese.

== History ==
In 1974, after the Newspaper and Printing Presses Act was passed in Singapore, the Singapore branch of &quot;Sin Chew Jit Poh&quot; was reorganised into a public entity under the name Sin Chew Jit Poh (Singapore), while the Singapore edition of &quot;Nanyang Siang Pau&quot; became owned by Nanyang Press Singapore. The two Chinese broadsheets in Singapore merged in March 1983 in anticipation of the impending falling readership, due to English being taught as first language in Singaporean schools. The merger led to the formation of Singapore News and Publications, which published the morning paper &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; as well as the evening paper &quot;Lianhe Wanbao&quot;. &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; was the most read newspaper in Singapore among all English and Chinese newspapers, according to a survey conducted by Survey Research Singapore in 1983, with a readership of 689,000 on weekdays and 743,000 on Sundays. On 4 August 1984, the company merged with The Straits Times Press Group and Times Publishing Berhad to form Singapore Press Holdings.

From 8 September 2016, the portal also presents news from two other Singapore Press Holdings Chinese-language newspapers, &quot;Lianhe Wanbao&quot; and &quot;Shin Min Daily News&quot;. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Zaobao&#x27;s combined print and digital circulation in Singapore fell from 187,900 in 2015 to 144,000 in 2020, according to company filings.&quot;

According to a 2021 study from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the paper has a weekly offline reach of 8% and online reach of 7% in Singapore.

== Editorial stance ==

&quot;Zaobao&quot; is regarded as pro-Beijing by Western media outlets.⁣ The newspaper has included articles from pro-Beijing sources such as &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, &quot;HK01&quot;, &quot;Ming Pao, Global Times,&quot; &quot;China Times&quot; and &quot;United Daily News&quot;. It is one of the few foreign newspapers allowed in China, where all media is tightly controlled and content censored. According to Radio Free Asia, content about the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre has been censored from the &quot;Zaobao&quot; website when accessed from Hong Kong.

A 2019 study by Scotland-based researcher Daniel Hammond found that &quot;Zaobao&quot; played the role of &quot;China’s critical friend in Southeast Asia&quot;, using the region as a means to deliver its concerns and criticisms of the country&#x27;s actions such as on the South China Sea, while covering the China-Singapore relationship in an overwhelmingly positive manner.

In April 2021, &quot;Zaobao&quot; renamed its &quot;Greater China&quot; section, which covers Taiwan, to simply &quot;China.&quot; In December 2021, &quot;Zaobao&quot; interviewed Peng Shuai following her disappearance. The interview, which critics labeled as scripted, generated criticisms of the newspaper.

In July 2023, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the paper had taken a more pro-Beijing stance by creating a China-specific version of the website to avoid having its website blocked in China. &quot;Zaobao&quot; issued a rebuttal in response to the &quot;WaPo&quot; article, stressing that it maintained journalistic neutrality and independence. Singapore&#x27;s ambassador to the US Lui Tuck Yew also responded by saying that in his former role as Singaporean Ambassador to China, he often heard &quot;Zaobao&quot;’s readers of various nationalities affirm the paper’s balanced coverage and uniquely Singaporean viewpoints, adding that it was &quot;misguided for American news outlets to expect &quot;Zaobao&quot; to resemble the Washington Post, or for Singapore to follow either the United States or China.&quot;

At the September 2023 centennial celebration of the newspaper, Prime Minister of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong said he was &quot;heartened that &quot;Zaobao&quot; has been unwavering in its principles, and has remained independent and objective in its news reporting.&quot; He added that when publishing articles by foreign contributors, &quot;Zaobao should also ensure that its readers are aware who these writers are speaking for and recognise that these views do not represent Zaobao’s stance.&quot;

==Format==
=== Broadsheet ===

The paper is published daily by SPH and usually hits newsstands and homes by 5 am local time. &quot;Zaobao&quot; is currently published in three segments. The first comprises breaking news () and local news under &quot;ZaobaoSINGAPORE&quot; (). The second comprises &quot;ZaobaoChina&quot; (), the sports section (), obituaries, the daily editorial, commentaries, letters to the press, other international news from the ASEAN, followed by a finance section &quot;ZaobaoBUSINESS&quot; (). A supplementary lifestyle, arts and entertainment segment is named &quot;Fukan&quot; () with classified advertising at the back of that segment.

The Sunday edition is titled &quot;zbSunday&quot; (), with a tabloid-format lifestyle supplement pull-out &quot;zbWeekly&quot; ().

=== Zaobao Digital ===

The newspaper is available in Southeast Asia, China, Hong Kong as well as organisations such as the United Nations. The online version of the paper Zaobao.com was launched in August 1995 under the name of &quot;Lianhe Zaobao Online&quot;. It serves as a news portal drawing news not just from the &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot;, but also from other Chinese newspapers in the region. A large proportion of &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; daily readership is derived from China, with the official website cites a monthly online readership of 4 million originating from China.

Zaobao.com is targeted at audiences in Greater China, while Zaobao.sg (re-launched in September 2016) targets local and non-China readers. In 2019, &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; launched an English-language e-magazine called ThinkChina.

== ZBSchools.sg ==
ZBSchools.sg is an online portal hosting several publications targeted at students such as zbCOMMA (), Thumbs Up (), Thumbs Up Junior () and Thumbs Up Little Junior (). zbCOMMA is targeted at secondary school students, Thumbs Up at upper primary students, Thumbs Up Junior at lower primary students and Thumbs Up Little Junior at kindergarten students.

zbCOMMA used to be known as Friday Weekly () before its revamp on 7 January 2009. It consists of follow-ups on news on Lianhe Zaobao, articles written by Zaobao reporters and blurbs for Zaobao news that serve to connect students with Zaobao.

== Blocking in China ==
The &quot;Zaobao&quot; online website is occasionally blocked in mainland China, or has its posts removed on Sina Weibo. In 2009, the &quot;Zaobao&quot; website was temporarily blocked in China, analysts in China believed it was likely related to an article &quot;Lianhe Zaobao&quot; ran headlined &quot;Cyber Crackdown in China Angers Netizens&quot; which sparked the temporary ban, as discourse against the Chinese government is censored. The paper was again reportedly blocked in 2017 with no official reasons cited.
