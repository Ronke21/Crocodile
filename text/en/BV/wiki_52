==History==


Namakkal is a historic city with references back to at least the 6th century. The name Namakkal derives from Namagiri, which is the name of the single rock formation at the centre of the town dedicated to Lord Vishnu. The rock is 65 meters high and over a kilometre in circumference.

There are two cave temples namely Sri Namagiri Thayar sametha Sri Narasimhaswamy Perumal Temple and Sri Ranganatha Perumal Temple which are excavated in this Namagiri hill and is believed to be built during the 6th century CE by the Satyaputra Kings and Pandya kings with the help of rock-cut architecture style and various inscriptions. Historian Soundara Rajan places the date to a pre-Varagunan I (800–830 CE) era on the 8th century. Based on the palaeography and rock-cut architecture, P. R. Srinivasan has placed it at 6th century. Most of the historians have compared the temples with similar architectural elements found in Badami Caves (6th century) and a possible influence. There are few inscriptions in the temple, especially an undated inscription in Grantha Characters at the Ranganatha temple which are similar to the inscriptions in the Ganesha Ratha in Mahabalipuram, which is in another cave in the upper part of the hill. Another inscription mentions it as Adiyendra Vishnu Grham which evidently shows that the cave was excavated by the Satyaputra Kings, the recently discovered inscription not only confirms this but also mentions the king&#x27;s name as &quot;Gunasila&quot; (Dated 500 CE). Historians believe it is possible that both the temples were built during the same period. 

Over this massive rock, is a fort, Namakkal Fort. Kongu nadu a small kingdom who ruled Namakkal during the 16th century. During Sangam age, Namakkal region formed a part of the historical Kongu Nadu region ruled by Cheras It is believed that Tippu Sultan hid himself in this fort for some time to escape the British. The fort was not built by Tippu Sultan but he occupied it for a brief period of time. Later the fort was captured by British. The front side of the hill is called Thiru. Vi. Ka. Paarai and today is used by taxis as their stand. 
Namakkal is a part of Kongu Nadu which was hotly contested and coveted by both the ancient Pallavas and the Pandyas. Namakkal was in the hands of Atiakula King called Gunasila who had an alliance with Pallava King through marriage. Later the taluk was overrun by the Cholas in the Mandalam. After the struggle between the Cheras, Cholas and Pandiyan, the Hoysalas rose to power and had control till the 14th century followed by the Vijayanagara Kings until 1565 AD. Then the Telugu Madurai Nayaks came to power in 1623 AD. Two of the polygons of Thirumalai Nayak, namely, Ramachandra Nayaka and Gatti Mudaliars, ruled the Salem area. The Namakkal Fort is reported to have been built by Ramachandra Nayakas. After about 1625 AD, the area successively came successively under the rule of Muslim Sultans of Bijapur and Golkonda, Mysore kings and then the Marathas.

Hyder Ali came to power in about the year 1750 AD. During this period, it was a history of power struggle between Hyder Ali and later Tippu, with the British. Namakkal was held by Killdhar (Caption) of Hyder Ali until it was captured by British in 1768. For a brief period during late 18th and early 19th century Namakkal was under Tiruchirappalli district of British Rule. Later, Namakkal was transferred back to Salem District. Then at 01-01-1997 finally announced as a separate district from Salem District.

Mahatma Gandhi held a public meeting in 1933 in Namakkal under the slope of the Namakkal rock.

<doc id="621163" wikidata="Q910255" url="?curid=621163" title="International Standard Bibliographic Description">
<text>The International Standard Bibliographic Description (ISBD) is a set of rules produced by the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to create a bibliographic description in a standard, human-readable form, especially for use in a bibliography or a library catalog. A preliminary consolidated edition of the ISBD was published in 2007 and the consolidated edition was published in 2011, superseding earlier separate ISBDs for monographs, older monographic publications, cartographic materials, serials and other continuing resources, electronic resources, non-book materials, and printed music. In 2022, IFLA published the 2021 update to the 2011 consolidated edition, which includes expanding ISBD to include unpublished resources, integrating stipulations for the application of ISBD to the description of component parts, clarifying cartographic resources stipulations, as well as added examples and updates to the Areas and glossary sections. IFLA&#x27;s ISBD Review Group is responsible for maintaining the ISBD.

One of the original purposes of the ISBD was to provide a standard form of bibliographic description that could be used to exchange records internationally. This would support IFLA&#x27;s Universal Bibliographic Control program.

== Structure of an ISBD record ==
The ISBD defines nine areas of description. Each area, except area 7, is composed of multiple elements with structured classifications. Elements and areas that do not apply to a particular resource are omitted from the description. Standardized punctuation (colons, semicolons, slashes, dashes, commas, and periods) is used to identify and separate the elements and areas. The order of elements and standardized punctuation make it easier to interpret bibliographic records when one does not understand the language of the description.

* 0: Content form and media type area
* 1: Title and statement of responsibility area, consisting of
** 1.1 Title proper
** 1.2 Parallel title
** 1.3 Other title information
** 1.4 Statement of responsibility
* 2: Edition area
* 3: Material or type of resource specific area (e.g., the scale of a map or the numbering of a periodical)
* 4: Publication, production, distribution, etc., area
* 5: Material description area (e.g., number of pages in a book or number of CDs issued as a unit)
* 6: Series area
* 7: Notes area
* 8: Resource identifier and terms of availability area (e.g., ISBN, ISSN)

== Example ==
A typical ISBD record looks like this:

<doc id="621166" wikidata="Q2733482" url="?curid=621166" title="Happy Together (song)">
<text>&quot;Happy Together&quot; is a song written by Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon and recorded by American rock band the Turtles. It was released as a single, backed with (b/w) &quot;Like the Seasons&quot;, in January 1967, and peaked at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the band&#x27;s first and only chart-topper there. It also reached the top 20 in various countries, including number 2 in Canada and number 12 in the UK. It was later included on the Turtles&#x27; third studio album &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1967).

Bonner and Gordon composed the song while members of the Magicians. The Turtles recorded their version in the Sunset Sound studio, with the newly arrived bassist Chip Douglas arranging the horns and backing vocals.

After the song&#x27;s successful release, the band was called to perform on TV shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and &quot;The Smothers Brothers Show&quot; in 1967. Music critics have continued to praise the Turtles version for its pop qualities. It was covered by several acts, with the most successful being by the soft rock duo Captain &amp; Tennille, and has been featured on numerous movies and TV shows. In 1999, BMI included the song in the list of the most-performed songs in the United States in the 20th century and, in 2007, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman, singers of the Turtles, were involved on various legal battles due to their attempts to copyright &quot;Happy Together&quot; against unauthorized broadcasts, notably with Sirius XM Radio.

==Background==
Alan Gordon had served as the drummer and one of the primary songwriters of the Magicians, which had recently evolved from Tex &amp; the Chex. He wrote and co-wrote a number of songs for the band, most famously &quot;An Invitation to Cry&quot; (with Jimmy Woods). Gordon already had many of the lyrics in mind for &quot;Happy Together&quot; but the chorus of the song came to him at the Park Street Diner in Ayer, Massachusetts, after visiting his father. The melody was based on the constant tuning of guitarist Allan &quot;Jake&quot; Jacobs during the band&#x27;s concerts. After a failed attempt to convince Jacobs to write the song with him, Gordon finished it with vocalist Garry Bonner.

In 1965, Bonner and Gordon started to work with publishers Charles Koppelman and Don Rubin from the Koppelman/Rubin Associates, writing songs for artists selected by them. The songwriters cut a demo of &quot;Happy Together&quot; and offered it to several artists including the Happenings, the Vogues and the Tokens, but it was rejected by all of them.

Around the same time, California band the Turtles had been struggling with financial and personal problems. After scoring three Top 40 hits in 1965 and 1966, including Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me Babe&quot; and &quot;You Baby&quot;, their next five singles had not charted well. Chip Douglas and John Barbata had stepped in as replacements for the original members. As an act focused on singles, member Mark Volman explained that their lack of success almost caused the Turtles to break up.

Lead vocalist Howard Kaylan mentions in his autobiography, and in the Turtles&#x27; documentary, that the group found &quot;Happy Together&quot; after spending some time to listen to demos submitted by publishing companies. Volman remembers it slightly differently, saying that, between the sets of a Manhattan gig, Bonner and Gordon themselves asked the band if they needed material, and then subsequently sent some demos that included &quot;Happy Together&quot;. Because of its circulation to many other artists, the demo acetate was worn out and, according to Fred Bronson, &quot;practically unlistenable&quot;, with Kaylan describing the acetate as &quot;scratchy and sticky&quot;.

During an interview with Grammy Awards, Howard Kaylan said that, when he heard it the first time, he considered the recording to be &quot;terrible&quot;, but later understood that the rejection by other artists was due to the performance. Kaylan recalled that the demo consisted of &quot;one guy (Gary Bonner) strumming an acoustic guitar while the other (Alan Gordon) sings in a bizarre falsetto to get a semblance of rhythm going. Their voices were abysmal&quot;. Volman agreed with Kaylan, calling the demo &quot;amateurish, lacking any kind of professional performance&quot;.

Conversely, Brill Building session guitarist Ralph Casale, in an interview with Songfacts affirmed that he had played on the demo and that other session musicians were involved. The performance was in a &quot;Lovin&#x27; Spoonful feel&quot; and praised it as much like a &quot;finished product&quot;.
Stereogum critic Tom Breihan comments that the Turtles were &quot;hungry&quot; for a hit and with Bonner and Gordon&#x27;s song &quot;it all fit&quot;. Volman observed:
==Recording==
Wanting to record the song, the Turtles had the writers travel from New York to California where Garry Bonner and Alan Gordon performed for them live at the Beverly Hills Hotel. According to Kaylan, &quot;they sounded even worse than the demo, but it didn&#x27;t matter. We wanted this song, and they and their publishers [Koppelman-Rubin] certainly wanted us to have it.&quot; The group rehearsed &quot;Happy Together&quot; in live performances for eight months, although music author Wayne Wadhams states the rehearsals lasted only two weeks. With the audience&#x27;s response becoming very positive, the band members decided to record the song in January 1967.

Koppelman/Rubin, as the publishers of Bonner and Gordon songs, chose how &quot;Happy Together&quot; was going to be recorded, substituting the original producer Bones Howe with Joe Wissert, and the Turtles&#x27; familiar United Western studios with Sunset Sound, which had been the studio for emerging artists like the Doors. The &quot;Happy Together&quot; session was engineered by Sunset Sound regular Bruce Botnick.

As with all their previous records, the band – Kaylan, Volman, guitarists Al Nichol and Jim Tucker, bassist Chip Douglas and drummer John Barbata – played on the recording of &quot;Happy Together&quot; (their independent label, White Whale, could not afford LA session musicians to augment or replace them like other artists on bigger labels), while being accompanied by an orchestra of horns and woodwinds.

According to engineer Botnick, the Turtles benefited from an eight-track recorder being used. The first three tracks were for the basic instrumentation, the other three were for the vocals, and the seventh was for the orchestra overdubs. Barbata recalled that they recorded the drums, bass and guitars at the same time, and then overdubbed the vocals and the orchestra. Volman said that the band usually didn&#x27;t experiment in the studio, and, for him, the process of recording was unremarkable. Botnick agreed with him, stating that the session was short and he would be surprised if it lasted more than three hours: &quot;maybe another three hours to do vocals, and it was basically done&quot;. Kaylan wrote that he recorded his lead vocals in one take. The basic track was cut in 15 takes according to Fred Bronson&#x27;s book &quot;The Billboard Book of Number One Hits&quot;, but Barbata presumed that they had achieved a satisfying sound in only two takes.
Although some members of the band contributed to the record&#x27;s arrangements, probably the most cited is 
Chip Douglas. With only nine months in the group, Douglas proved to be important for the record, arranging the horns and the backing vocals. Both Kaylan and Volman praised his arrangement, the former stating that &quot;Chip knew what he wanted to hear and he actually heard in his head the blend of horns and voices. He wanted to have the flutes echo the high voices and the horns be the middle voices&quot;. John Barbata credited himself with creating &quot;those drum parts that helped make it [the record] magical&quot;.

After the orchestra was overdubbed, Kaylan said he remembered that he took the mono acetate home and listened to it numerous times: &quot;I just couldn’t believe how well the orchestra sat with the track, and how well the vocals blended, and just the overall mysterious sound we got. We knew it was gonna be a No.1 record&quot;. He noted that the song&#x27;s production had sparse instrumentation in some portions while other segments were described as being &quot;so &#x27;Wall of Sound&#x27;&quot;, referring to the production methods of record producer Phil Spector, consisting of heavily layered instrumentation optimized for mono, indicating his influence on Wissert.

==Composition==
The sheet music for &quot;Happy Together&quot; shows the key of E minor, but Wadhams and music teacher Emily Langerholc observed that the Turtles&#x27; recording is in F minor during the verses and F major (F Mixolydian) during the chorus. The song is in common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. It starts with an electric guitar, followed by drums and electric bass, then Kaylan starts to sing the first two verses, reinforced by another guitar and reverberated vocal harmonies in the second verse, before the chorus begins (consisting of double-tracked lead vocals now backed by four part &quot;ah&quot; singing and trumpets).

The switch of minor key verses to the major key chorus is called by Langerholc as &quot;one of the most effective minor to major switcharoos of all time&quot;, citing that the change is preceded by a C chord (V) at the end of the verse and is in Common Tone Modulation. This structure accompanies Kaylan in the third verse, the second chorus, the first repeat of the third verse (harmonizing with Volman), the &quot;baa, baa&quot; chorus and the outro: the second repeat of the third with the coda, that consists of another &quot;baa, baa&quot; section with the joining of the orchestra and the band, before the reverb fades the song. Langerholc stated that the outro (F minor verse with the F major coda) is possibly a Picardy third.

Many listeners (such as Langerholc) thought that the lyrics of &quot;Happy Together&quot; were about a couple in love with each other due to its cheery chorus and the title, but, according to historian James E. Perone, a closer reading in the lyrics (&quot;imagine me and you&quot;, &quot;if i should call you&quot;) reveals that the love expressed by the narrator is not reciprocated by the other person, with Perone stating that the relationship &quot;is only in dreams, wishes, desires and the mind of the singer&quot;. O&#x27;Rourke felt that the song &quot;stretches the contrast between the loneliness of being apart and the thrill of being together to bipolar extremes&quot;. Joe Viglione compared &quot;Happy Together&quot;&#x27;s lyrics to Tommy James&#x27;s hit &quot;Mirage&quot;, but while &quot;Mirage&quot; was about an ex-girlfriend, &quot;the Turtles never even get to first base in their laments&quot;. O&#x27;Rourke observed that is the listener&#x27;s option to determine if in the final line &quot;We&#x27;re happy together&quot;, the narrator conquered his beloved, &quot;or if he’s just retreated into his fantasy world for good&quot;.

==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;Happy Together&quot; was released as a single in January 1967, backed with the Warren Zevon-penned &quot;Like the Seasons&quot;. To promote the single, the band members performed in a couple of shows, including &quot;The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; in February. The Turtles would be called to perform on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; on May 14, 1967, and again, as a quintet, on November 12 (Tucker had left for personal reasons). During this time, Douglas had left the Turtles to produce the Monkees. His replacement was Jim Pons, formerly from the Leaves. With Pons, they participated in a film shot in March that consisted of &quot;the group running, jumping, rolling and mugging in a park in Los Angeles&quot;. Guitarist Tucker said in an interview that the park location was possibly Griffith Park.

According to Volman, the song slowly climbed through the charts, saying that &quot;it took maybe three or four weeks before it even got into the Top 20&quot;. He credits the radio airplay for helping the song to top the charts, on March 25, overtaking The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. It stayed at #1 for three weeks before being knocked out of the #1 position by Frank and Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s duet &quot;Somethin&#x27; Stupid&quot;. In total, the record stayed on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts for 15 weeks. &quot;Happy Together&quot; was the breakthrough hit for the Turtles in Britain, where it peaked at number 12. The single, mainly distributed by London Recordings on other countries, became a Top 10 hit in Australia, Canada, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and Spain.

The associated album &quot;Happy Together&quot; was released in April 1967. The &quot;Happy Together&quot; single sold three million copies, and was certified 3× platinum by the RIAA on February 7, 2024.

==Reception and accolades==
The single received primarily positive reviews in the American press at the time. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine described &quot;Happy Together&quot; as a &quot;groovy folk-oriented item&quot; that could repeat the chart success of the Turtles&#x27; earlier hit single &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe (also predicting that the song would reach the Top 20) and praised Joe Wissert&#x27;s production. It is similarly described in &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine, where they write that it is a &quot;happy go-lucky melody-rocker&quot; regarding a boy who has fallen in love. They end the review by noting that it might become a hit for the group. In &quot;Record World&quot;, the song was ranked a &quot;sleeper of the week&quot;, stating that the group are &quot;happy together&quot;, which they had to be in order to get the song &quot;into the grooves&quot;. In the UK, the single also received praise. In &quot;Disc &amp; Music Echo&quot;, critic Penny Valentine writes that the group has a &quot;divine sound going&quot; on the song. She positively notes the guitars, which she considers &quot;warm&quot;, and closes the review by stating that the lead singer &quot;threads&quot; the lyrics together. Peter Jones from &quot;Record Mirror&quot; believes that &quot;Happy Together&quot; starts off tamely which escalates into a &quot;most commercial sort of sound.&quot; He also adds that the chorus appealed to him the most. All in all, he gave the single four stars.

Since then, the song has continued to receive positive reviews. the Denise Sullivan of AllMusic stated that the Turtles had combined &quot;all their pop, folk, psychedelia, and Zombies-style harmony expertise&quot; into &quot;Happy Together&quot;, while considering it a &quot;pop perfection&quot; and &quot;a most sublime slice of pop heaven&quot;. In his book, &quot;Sixties Rock, a Listener&#x27;s Guide&quot;, Robert Santelli called the song &quot;arguably one of the two or three greatest pop constructions with its intricate arrangement and great harmonies&quot;. Wadhams called it a &quot;brilliant pop production, deftly crafted by Joe Wissert&quot;, while observing that &quot;good pop can be produced by formula, but great pop—like The Turtles&#x27; best—combines real music art with a pure, ear-charming entertainment&quot;. A reviewer from &quot;The Daily Guru&quot; claimed that &quot;the way in which The Turtles take a base of folk music, yet give it a more rock-style edge and mood is the most obvious difference, and the manner with which the chorus sections seem to soar away from the rest of the song is where &quot;Happy Together&quot; truly becomes an unforgettable moment in music history&quot;.

Some reviewers and authors labeled it &quot;bubblegum pop&quot;, but Sullivan and &quot;The Daily Guru&quot; reviewer observed that, despite its bubblegum sensibilities, the song &quot;rises above it&quot; and its &quot;[later] continued legendary status makes it far more than that&quot;.

Tom Breihan of &quot;Stereogum&quot; praised &quot;Happy Together&quot; for its instrumentation but felt that the Turtles were only capitalizing on Beatles and Beach Boys innovations to &quot;put them in service of the sort of silly no-stakes love songs that those bands might’ve recorded a few years earlier in their career.&quot; He rated it an 8/10.

Due to its subsequent popularity, in 1999, BMI named &quot;Happy Together&quot;, with approximately five million performances on American radio, the 44th most-performed song in the United States of the 20th century, placing it in the same league as &quot;Yesterday&quot; by the Beatles and &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; by Simon &amp; Garfunkel. In 2007, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

==Copyright lawsuits==
Flo &amp; Eddie, legal successors to the Turtles, filed a lawsuit in the New York Court of Appeals against Sirius XM Radio to establish common law copyright on their original recording of &quot;Happy Together&quot;. As the song was recorded in 1967, five years before federal sound copyright was established, the group sought to establish that such recordings were covered under common law copyright, a nebulous form of copyright held at the state level, in the hopes of earning royalties from Sirius XM; as they did not write the song, they could receive only performance royalties. The Court of Appeals had previously ruled that such a common law copyright may exist for the sale of recordings in New York in the 2005 ruling &quot;Capitol Records, Inc. v. Naxos of America, Inc.&quot;. On December 20, 2016, the Court ruled that no such common law copyright exists in New York for public performances of a sound recording, and that Flo &amp; Eddie could not claim royalties.

On March 20, 2016, Scottish rock band Biffy Clyro released their single &quot;Wolves of Winter&quot;, which originally featured the lyric &quot;we have the chance to be happy together&quot; in the pre-chorus, sung in a similar manner to the Turtles&#x27; recording. However, the lyric was changed due to copyright infringement, becoming &quot;we have the chance to survive the winter&quot;, as sung in the second pre-chorus.

==Usage in media==
In 1999, the song was used in a commercial for the Nintendo 64 crossover fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; The commercial depicts mascot costumes of Mario, Donkey Kong, Yoshi, and Pikachu skipping through a field of flowers, until Mario trips Yoshi, at which point the four start fighting each other, all while the song plays in the background.

The romantic-drama &quot;Happy Together&quot; (1997) by Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai, takes its English title from the song, while a cover version by artist Danny Chung plays during the film&#x27;s ending. The 2005 British rom-com &quot;Imagine Me &amp; You&quot; also takes its title from the song&#x27;s lyrics, with it playing a key role in the film&#x27;s climax and the original Turtles version playing over the ending.

Jim Bessman reported for &quot;Billboard&quot; that the &quot;key usage in the acclaimed movie&quot; &quot;Adaptation&quot; is &quot;as a means of juxtaposing a soundtrack song against the story&#x27;s mood, à la &#x27;As Time Goes By&#x27; in &quot;Casablanca&quot;&quot;. Bessman goes on to say that &quot;the song&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Adaptation&quot; has also spurred the solo side of Kaylan&#x27;s career.&quot;
A cover of the song was created by Canadian rock band Simple Plan for the 2003 film adaptation of &quot;Freaky Friday&quot; and the accompanying soundtrack.

<doc id="621169" wikidata="Q1699404" url="?curid=621169" title="Existence of God">
<text>The existence of God is a subject of debate in the philosophy of religion and theology. A wide variety of arguments for and against the existence of God (with the same or similar arguments also generally being used when talking about the existence of multiple deities) can be categorized as logical, empirical, metaphysical, subjective, or scientific. In philosophical terms, the question of the existence of God involves the disciplines of epistemology (the nature and scope of knowledge) and ontology (study of the nature of being or existence) and the theory of value (since some definitions of God include &quot;perfection&quot;).

The Western tradition of philosophical discussion of the existence of God began with Plato and Aristotle, who made arguments for the existence of a being responsible for fashioning the universe, referred to as the demiurge or the unmoved mover, that today would be categorized as cosmological arguments. Other arguments for the existence of God have been proposed by St. Anselm, who formulated the first ontological argument; Thomas Aquinas, who presented his own version of the cosmological argument (the first way); René Descartes, who said that the existence of a benevolent God is logically necessary for the evidence of the senses to be meaningful. John Calvin argued for a &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot;, which gives each human a knowledge of God&#x27;s existence. Islamic philosophers who developed arguments for the existence of God comprise Averroes, who made arguments influenced by Aristotle&#x27;s concept of the unmoved mover; Al-Ghazali and Al-Kindi, who presented the Kalam cosmological argument; Avicenna, who presented the Proof of the Truthful; and Al-Farabi, who made Neoplatonic arguments.

In philosophy, and more specifically in the philosophy of religion, atheism refers to the proposition that God does not exist. Some religions, such as Jainism, reject the possibility of a creator deity. Philosophers who have provided arguments against the existence of God include David Hume, Ludwig Feuerbach, and Bertrand Russell.

Theism, the proposition that God exists, is the dominant view among philosophers of religion. In a 2020 PhilPapers survey, 69.50% of philosophers of religion stated that they accept or lean towards theism, while 19.86% stated they accept or lean towards atheism. Prominent contemporary philosophers of religion who defended theism include Alvin Plantinga, Yujin Nagasawa, John Hick, Richard Swinburne, and William Lane Craig, while those who defended atheism include Graham Oppy, Paul Draper, Quentin Smith, 
J. L. Mackie, and J. L. Schellenberg.

== Positions ==

Positions on the existence of God can be divided along numerous axes, producing a variety of orthogonal classifications. Theism and atheism are positions of belief or lack of it, while gnosticism and agnosticism are positions of knowledge or the lack of it. Ignosticism concerns belief about God&#x27;s conceptual coherence. Apatheism concerns belief about the practical importance of whether God exists.

For the purposes of discussion, Richard Dawkins described seven &quot;milestones&quot; on his spectrum of theistic probability:

# Strong theist. 100% probability that God exists. In the words of Carl G. Jung: &quot;I do not believe, I know.&quot;
# &quot;De facto&quot; theist. Very high probability but short of 100%. &quot;I don&#x27;t know for certain, but I strongly believe in God and live my life on the assumption that he is there.&quot;
# Leaning towards theism. Higher than 50% but not very high. &quot;I am very uncertain, but I am inclined to believe in God.&quot;
# Completely impartial. Exactly 50%. &quot;God&#x27;s existence and nonexistence are exactly equiprobable.&quot;
# Leaning towards atheism. Lower than 50% but not very low. &quot;I do not know whether God exists but I&#x27;m inclined to be skeptical.&quot;
# &quot;De facto&quot; atheist. Very low probability, but short of zero. &quot;I don&#x27;t know for certain but I think God is very improbable, and I live my life on the assumption that he is not there.&quot;
# Strong atheist. &quot;I know there is no God, with the same conviction as Jung knows there is one.&quot;

=== Theism ===

The Catholic Church, following the teachings of Paul the Apostle (e.g., ), Thomas Aquinas, and the First Vatican Council, affirms that God&#x27;s existence &quot;can be known with certainty from the created world by the natural light of human reason&quot;.

==== Traditional religious definition of God ====

In classical theism, God is characterized as the metaphysically ultimate being (the first, timeless, absolutely simple and sovereign being, who is devoid of any anthropomorphic qualities), in distinction to other conceptions such as theistic personalism, open theism, and process theism. Classical theists do not believe that God can be completely defined. They believe it would contradict the transcendent nature of God for mere humans to define him. Robert Barron explains by analogy that it seems impossible for a two-dimensional object to conceive of three-dimensional humans.

In modern Western societies, the concepts of God typically entail a monotheistic, supreme, ultimate, and personal being, as found in the Christian, Islamic and Jewish traditions. In monotheistic religions outside the Abrahamic traditions, the existence of God is discussed in similar terms. In these traditions, God is also identified as the author (either directly or by inspiration) of certain texts, or that certain texts describe specific historical events caused by the God in question or communications from God (whether in direct speech or via dreams or omens). Some traditions also believe that God is the entity which is currently answering prayers for intervention or information or opinions.

Many Islamic scholars have used philosophical and rational arguments to prove the existence of God. For example, Ibn Rushd, a 12th-century Islamic scholar, philosopher, and physician, states there are only two arguments worthy of adherence, both of which are found in what he calls the &quot;Precious Book&quot; (The Qur&#x27;an). Rushd cites &quot;providence&quot; and &quot;invention&quot; in using the Qur&#x27;an&#x27;s parables to claim the existence of God. Rushd argues that the Earth&#x27;s weather patterns are conditioned to support human life; thus, if the planet is so finely-tuned to maintain life, then it suggests a fine tuner—God. The Sun and the Moon are not just random objects floating in the Milky Way, rather they serve us day and night, and the way nature works and how life is formed, humankind benefits from it. Rushd essentially comes to a conclusion that there has to be a higher being who has made everything perfectly to serve the needs of human beings.

Moses ben Maimon, widely known as Maimonides, was a Jewish scholar who tried to logically prove the existence of God. Maimonides offered proofs for the existence of God, but he did not begin with defining God first, like many others do. Rather, he used the description of the earth and the universe to prove the existence of God. He talked about the Heavenly bodies and how they are committed to eternal motion. Maimonides argued that because every physical object is finite, it can only contain a finite amount of power. If everything in the universe, which includes all the planets and the stars, is finite, then there has to be an infinite power to push forth the motion of everything in the universe. Narrowing down to an infinite being, the only thing that can explain the motion is an infinite being (meaning God) which is neither a body nor a force in the body. Maimonides believed that this argument gives us a ground to believe that God is, not an idea of what God is. He believed that God cannot be understood or be compared.

==== Non-personal definitions of God ====

In pantheism, God and the universe are considered to be the same thing. In this view, the natural sciences are essentially studying the nature of God. This definition of God creates the philosophical problem that a universe with God and one without God are the same, other than the words used to describe it.

Deism and panentheism assert that there is a God distinct from, or which extends beyond (either in time or in space or in some other way) the universe. These positions deny that God intervenes in the operation of the universe, including communicating with humans personally. The notion that God never intervenes or communicates with the universe, or may have evolved into the universe (as in pandeism), makes it difficult, if not by definition impossible, to distinguish between a universe with God and one without.

The &quot;Ethics&quot; of Baruch Spinoza gave two demonstrations of the existence of God. The God of Spinoza is uncaused by any external force and has no free will, it is not personal and not anthropomorphic.

==== Debate about how theism should be argued ====

In Christian faith, theologian and philosopher Thomas Aquinas made a distinction between: (a) preambles of faith and (b) articles of faith. The preambles include alleged truths contained in revelation which are nevertheless demonstrable by reason, e.g., the immortality of the soul, the existence of God. The articles of faith, on the other hand, contain truths that cannot be proven or reached by reason alone and presuppose the truths of the preambles, e.g., in Christianity, the Holy Trinity, is not demonstrable and presupposes the existence of God.

The argument that the existence of God can be known to all, even prior to exposure to any divine revelation, predates Christianity. Paul the Apostle made this argument when he said that pagans were without excuse because &quot;since the creation of the world God&#x27;s invisible nature, namely, his eternal power and deity, has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made&quot;. In this, Paul alludes to the proofs for a creator, later enunciated by Thomas Aquinas and others, that had also been explored by the Greek philosophers.

Another apologetical school of thought, including Dutch and American Reformed thinkers (such as Abraham Kuyper, Benjamin Warfield, and Herman Dooyeweerd), emerged in the late 1920s. This school was instituted by Cornelius Van Til, and came to be popularly called presuppositional apologetics (though Van Til felt &quot;transcendental&quot; would be a more accurate title). The main distinction between this approach and the more classical evidentialist approach is that the presuppositionalist denies any common ground between the believer and the non-believer, except that which the non-believer denies, namely, the assumption of the truth of the theistic worldview. In other words, presuppositionalists do not believe that the existence of God can be proven by appeal to raw, uninterpreted, or &quot;brute&quot; facts, which have the same (theoretical) meaning to people with fundamentally different worldviews, because they deny that such a condition is even possible. They claim that the only possible proof for the existence of God is that the very same belief is the necessary condition to the intelligibility of all other human experience and action. They attempt to prove the existence of God by means of appeal to the transcendental necessity of the belief—indirectly (by appeal to the unavowed presuppositions of the non-believer&#x27;s worldview) rather than directly (by appeal to some form of common factuality). In practice this school uses what have come to be known as transcendental arguments. These arguments claim to demonstrate that all human experience and action (even the condition of unbelief, itself) is a proof for the existence of God, because God&#x27;s existence is the necessary condition of their intelligibility.

Protestant Christians note that the Christian faith teaches &quot;salvation is by faith&quot;, and that faith is reliance upon the faithfulness of God. The most extreme example of this position is called fideism, which holds that faith is simply the will to believe, and argues that if God&#x27;s existence were rationally demonstrable, faith in its existence would become superfluous. Søren Kierkegaard argued that objective knowledge, such as 1+1=2, is unimportant to existence. If God could rationally be proven, his existence would be unimportant to humans. It is because God cannot rationally be proven that his existence is important to us. In &quot;The Justification of Knowledge&quot;, the Calvinist theologian Robert L. Reymond argues that believers should not attempt to prove the existence of God. Since he believes all such proofs are fundamentally unsound, believers should not place their confidence in them, much less resort to them in discussions with non-believers; rather, they should accept the content of revelation by faith. Reymond&#x27;s position is similar to that of his mentor Gordon Clark, which holds that all worldviews are based on certain unprovable first premises (or, axioms), and therefore are ultimately unprovable. The Christian theist therefore must simply choose to start with Christianity rather than anything else, by a &quot;leap of faith&quot;. This position is also sometimes called presuppositional apologetics, but should not be confused with the Van Tillian variety.

=== Atheism ===

In the philosophy of religion, atheism is standardly defined as the metaphysical claim that God does not exist. In 1972, Antony Flew proposed defining atheism as the psychological state of lacking any belief in God. However, Flew&#x27;s definition is usually rejected, due to the need for a name for the direct opposite proposition to theism, the metaphysical claim that God does exist.

==== Positive atheism ====

Positive atheism (also called &quot;strong atheism&quot; and &quot;hard atheism&quot;) is a proposed form of atheism that asserts that no deities exist. The strong atheist explicitly asserts the non-existence of gods.

==== Negative atheism ====

Negative atheism (also called &quot;weak atheism&quot; and &quot;soft atheism&quot;) is a proposed form of atheism other than positive, wherein a person does not believe in the existence of any deities, but does not explicitly assert there to be none.

=== Agnosticism ===

Agnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims—especially claims about the existence of any deity, but also other religious and metaphysical claims—is unknown or unknowable. Agnosticism does not define one&#x27;s belief or disbelief in gods; agnostics may still identify themselves as theists or atheists.

==== Strong agnosticism ====

Strong agnosticism is the belief that it is impossible for humans to know whether or not any deities exist.

==== Weak agnosticism ====

Weak agnosticism is the belief that the existence or nonexistence of deities is unknown but not necessarily unknowable.

==== Agnostic theism ====

Agnostic theism is the philosophical view that encompasses both theism and agnosticism. An agnostic theist believes in the existence of a god or God, but regards the basis of this proposition as &quot;unknown or inherently unknowable&quot;. Agnostic theists may also insist on ignorance regarding the properties of the gods they believe in.

==== Agnostic atheism ====

Agnostic atheism is a philosophical position that encompasses both atheism and agnosticism. Agnostic atheists are atheistic because they do not hold a belief in the existence of any deity and agnostic because they claim that the existence of a deity is either unknowable in principle or currently unknown in fact.

The theologian Robert Flint explains:

=== Apatheism ===

An apatheist is someone who is not interested in accepting or denying any claims that gods exist or do not exist. An apatheist lives as if there are no gods and explains natural phenomena without reference to any deities. The existence of gods is not rejected, but may be designated unnecessary or useless; gods neither provide purpose to life, nor influence everyday life, according to this view.

=== Ignosticism ===

The ignostic (or igtheist) usually concludes that the question of God&#x27;s existence or nonexistence is usually not worth discussing because concepts like &quot;God&quot; are usually not sufficiently or clearly defined. Ignosticism or igtheism is the theological position that every other theological position (including agnosticism and atheism) assumes too much about the concept of God and many other theological concepts. It can be defined as encompassing two related views about the existence of God. The view that a coherent definition of God must be presented before the question of the existence of God can be meaningfully discussed. Furthermore, if that definition is unfalsifiable, the ignostic takes the theological noncognitivist position that the question of the existence of God (per that definition) is meaningless. In this case, the concept of God is not considered meaningless; the term &quot;God&quot; is considered meaningless. The second view is synonymous with theological noncognitivism, and skips the step of first asking &quot;What is meant by &#x27;God&#x27;?&quot; before proclaiming the original question &quot;Does God exist?&quot; as meaningless.

Some philosophers have seen ignosticism as a variation of agnosticism or atheism, while others have considered it to be distinct. An ignostic maintains that he cannot even say whether he is a theist or an atheist until a sufficient definition of theism is put forth.

The term &quot;ignosticism&quot; was coined in the 1960s by Sherwin Wine, a rabbi and a founding figure of Humanistic Judaism. The term &quot;igtheism&quot; was coined by the secular humanist Paul Kurtz in his 1992 book &quot;The New Skepticism&quot;.

== Philosophical issues ==

=== The problem of the supernatural ===

One problem posed by the question of the existence of God is that traditional beliefs usually ascribe to God various supernatural powers. Supernatural beings may be able to conceal and reveal themselves for their own purposes, as for example in the tale of Baucis and Philemon. In addition, according to concepts of God, God is not part of the natural order, but the ultimate creator of nature and of the scientific laws. Thus in Aristotelian philosophy, God is viewed as part of the explanatory structure needed to support scientific conclusions and any powers God possesses are—strictly speaking—of the natural order that is derived from God&#x27;s place as originator of nature (see also Monadology).

In Karl Popper&#x27;s philosophy of science, belief in a supernatural God is outside the natural domain of scientific investigation because all scientific hypotheses must be falsifiable in the natural world. The non-overlapping magisteria view proposed by Stephen Jay Gould also holds that the existence (or otherwise) of God is irrelevant to and beyond the domain of science.

Scientists follow the scientific method, within which theories must be verifiable by physical experiment. The majority of prominent conceptions of God explicitly or effectively posit a being whose existence is not testable either by proof or disproof. Therefore, the question of God&#x27;s existence may lie outside the purview of modern science by definition. The Catholic Church maintains that knowledge of the existence of God is the &quot;natural light of human reason&quot;. Fideists maintain that belief in God&#x27;s existence may not be amenable to demonstration or refutation, but rests on faith alone.

Logical positivists such as Rudolf Carnap and A. J. Ayer viewed any talk of gods as literal nonsense. For the logical positivists and adherents of similar schools of thought, statements about religious or other transcendent experiences can not have a truth value, and are deemed to be without meaning, because such statements do not have any clear verification criteria. As the Christian biologist Scott C. Todd put it &quot;Even if all the data pointed to an intelligent designer, such a hypothesis is excluded from science because it is not naturalistic.&quot; This argument limits the domain of science to the empirically observable and limits the domain of God to the empirically unprovable.

=== Nature of relevant proofs and arguments ===

John Polkinghorne suggests that the nearest analogy to the existence of God in physics is the ideas of quantum mechanics which are seemingly paradoxical but make sense of a great deal of disparate data.

Alvin Plantinga compares the question of the existence of God to the question of the existence of other minds, claiming both are notoriously impossible to &quot;prove&quot; against a determined skeptic.

One approach, suggested by writers such as Stephen D. Unwin, is to treat (particular versions of) theism and naturalism as though they were two hypotheses in the Bayesian sense, to list certain data (or alleged data), about the world, and to suggest that the likelihoods of these data are significantly higher under one hypothesis than the other. Most of the arguments for, or against, the existence of God can be seen as pointing to particular aspects of the universe in this way. In almost all cases it is not seriously suggested by proponents of the arguments that they are irrefutable, merely that they make one worldview seem significantly more likely than the other. However, since an assessment of the weight of evidence depends on the prior probability that is assigned to each worldview, arguments that a theist finds convincing may seem thin to an atheist and vice versa.

Philosophers, such as Wittgenstein, take a view that is considered anti-realist and oppose philosophical arguments related to God&#x27;s existence. For instance, Charles Taylor contends that the real is whatever will not go away. If we cannot reduce talk about God to anything else, or replace it, or prove it false, then perhaps God is as real as anything else.

In George Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge&quot; of 1710, he argued that a &quot;naked thought&quot; cannot exist, and that a perception is a thought; therefore only minds can be proven to exist, since all else is merely an idea conveyed by a perception. From this Berkeley argued that the universe is based upon observation and is non-objective. However, he noted that the universe includes &quot;ideas&quot; not perceptible to humankind, and that there must, therefore, exist an omniscient superobserver, which perceives such things. Berkeley considered this proof of the existence of the Christian god.

=== Outside of Western thought ===

Existence in absolute truth is central to Vedanta epistemology. Traditional sense perception based approaches were put into question as possibly misleading due to preconceived or superimposed ideas. But though all object-cognition can be doubted, the existence of the doubter remains a fact even in &quot;nastika&quot; traditions of &quot;mayavada&quot; schools following Adi Shankara. The five eternal principles to be discussed under ontology, beginning with God or Isvara, the Ultimate Reality cannot be established by the means of logic alone, and often require superior proof.

In Vaisnavism Vishnu, or his intimate ontological form of Krishna, is equated to the personal absolute God of the Western traditions. Aspects of Krishna as &quot;svayam bhagavan&quot; in original Absolute Truth, &quot;sat chit ananda&quot;, are understood originating from three essential attributes of Krishna&#x27;s form, i.e., &quot;eternal existence&quot; or &quot;&quot;, related to the &quot;brahman&quot; aspect; &quot;knowledge&quot; or chit, to the &quot;paramatman&quot;; and &quot;bliss&quot; or &quot;ananda&quot; in Sanskrit, to &quot;bhagavan&quot;.

== Arguments ==

=== Arguments for the existence of God===

==== Logical arguments ====

===== Aquinas&#x27; Five Ways =====

In article 3, question 2, first part of his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot;, Thomas Aquinas developed his five arguments for God&#x27;s existence. These arguments are grounded in an Aristotelian ontology and make use of the infinite regression argument. Aquinas did not intend to fully prove the existence of God as he is orthodoxly conceived (with all of his traditional attributes), but proposed his Five Ways as a first stage, which he built upon later in his work. Aquinas&#x27; Five Ways argued from the unmoved mover, first cause, necessary being, argument from degree, and the argument from final cause.

* The unmoved mover argument: things in the world are in motion, something can only be caused to move by a mover, therefore everything in the world must be moved by an unmoved mover. 
* The first cause argument: things in the world have a cause, and nothing is the cause of itself, so everything in the world must have a first cause or an uncaused cause. 
* The necessary being argument: things in the world are contingent, and contingent beings cannot exist without a cause, so everything in the world must be caused by a necessary being. 
* The degree argument: there are degrees of goodness and perfection among things, and something of a maximum degree must be the cause of things of a lower degree, so there must be a supremely good and perfect cause for all good things. 
* The final cause argument: things in the world act for an end or purpose, but only an intelligent being can direct itself towards a purpose, so there must be an intelligent being that directs things towards their purpose.

===== Cosmological argument =====

The cosmological argument is an a posteriori argument for a cause or reason for the cosmos.

One type of cosmological, or &quot;first cause&quot; argument, typically called the Kalam cosmological argument, asserts that since everything that begins to exist has a cause, and the universe began to exist, the universe must have had a cause which was itself not caused. This ultimate first cause is identified with God. Christian apologist William Lane Craig gives a version of this argument in the following form:

# Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
# The Universe began to exist.
# Therefore, the Universe had a cause.

===== Ontological argument =====

The ontological argument has been formulated by philosophers including St. Anselm and René Descartes. The argument proposes that God&#x27;s existence is self-evident. The logic, depending on the formulation, reads roughly as follows:

Thomas Aquinas criticized the argument for proposing a definition of God which, if God is transcendent, should be impossible for humans. Immanuel Kant criticized the proof from a logical standpoint: he stated that the term &quot;God&quot; really signifies two different terms: both idea of God, and God. Kant concluded that the proof is equivocation, based on the ambiguity of the word God. Kant also challenged the argument&#x27;s assumption that existence is a predicate (of perfection) because it does not add anything to the essence of a being. If existence is not a predicate, then it is not necessarily true that the greatest possible being exists. A common rebuttal to Kant&#x27;s critique is that, although &quot;existence&quot; does add something to both the concept and the reality of God, the concept would be vastly different if its referent is an unreal Being. Another response to Kant is attributed to Alvin Plantinga, who says that even if one were to grant that existence is not a real predicate, &quot;necessary existence&quot;, which is the correct formulation of an understanding of God, &quot;is&quot; a real predicate.

====== Gödel&#x27;s ontological proof======

The proof uses modal logic, which distinguishes between &quot;necessary&quot; truths and &quot;contingent&quot; truths. In the most common semantics for modal logic, many &quot;possible worlds&quot; are considered. A truth is &quot;necessary&quot; if it is true in all possible worlds. By contrast, if a statement happens to be true in our world, but is false in another world, then it is a &quot;contingent&quot; truth. A statement that is true in some world (not necessarily our own) is called a &quot;possible&quot; truth.

Furthermore, the proof uses higher-order (modal) logic because the definition of God employs an explicit quantification over properties.

First, Gödel axiomatizes the notion of a &quot;positive property&quot;: for each property &quot;φ&quot;, either &quot;φ&quot; or its negation ¬&quot;φ&quot; must be positive, but not both (axiom 2). If a positive property &quot;φ&quot; implies a property &quot;ψ&quot; in each possible world, then &quot;ψ&quot; is positive, too (axiom 1). Gödel then argues that each positive property is &quot;possibly exemplified&quot;, i.e. applies at least to some object in some world (theorem 1). Defining an object to be Godlike if it has all positive properties (definition 1), and requiring that property to be positive itself (axiom 3), Gödel shows that in &quot;some&quot; possible world a Godlike object exists (theorem 2), called &quot;God&quot; in the following. Gödel proceeds to prove that a Godlike object exists in &quot;every&quot; possible world.

====== Meinongian argument ======
====== Trademark argument ======
===== Plantinga&#x27;s free-will defense =====

Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world

Plantinga&#x27;s free-will defense begins by noting a distinction between &quot;moral evil&quot; and &quot;physical evil&quot; (Plantinga&#x27;s defense primarily references moral evil), then asserting that Mackie&#x27;s argument failed to establish an &quot;explicit&quot; logical contradiction between God and the existence of moral evil. In other words, Plantinga shows that (1–4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian&#x27;s &quot;implicit&quot; unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an &quot;explicit&quot; contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed. Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument, then an atheologian&#x27;s intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.

First, Plantinga, using modal logic, pointed out that omnipotence is the power to do all things logically possible, and thus God could not be expected to do things that are logically impossible. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God&#x27;s reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was invalid.

Plantinga&#x27;s defense has received strong support among academic philosophers, with many agreeing that it defeated the logical problem of evil. Contemporary atheologians have presented arguments claiming to have found the additional premises needed to create an explicitly contradictory theistic set by adding to the propositions 1–4.

===== Proof of the Truthful =====
==== Empirical arguments ====

===== Argument from beauty =====

===== Argument from consciousness =====

===== Argument from design =====

===== Argument from natural laws =====

The argument from natural laws (promoted by Isaac Newton, René Descartes, and Robert Boyle) holds that the existence of God is evident by the observation of governing laws and existing order in the Universe.

===== Argument from psychedelics =====

Human subjects in scientific studies have reported that psychedelic drugs such as LSD, mescaline, psilocybin mushrooms, and DMT provide perceptions of a transcendent reality, including encounters with God. 
Since prehistory, cultures around the world have used entheogens for the purpose of enabling mystical experiences. In &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot;, English philosopher and writer Aldous Huxley recounts his mystical experiences while he was under the influence of mescaline, arguing that the human brain normally filters reality, and that such drugs remove this filter, exposing humans to a broader spectrum of conscious awareness which he calls the &quot;Mind at Large&quot;.

===== Argument from sensus divinitatis =====
The argument from &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot; (Latin for &#x27;sense of divinity&#x27;) posits that humans are born with an innate sense, or cognitive mechanism, that grants them awareness of God&#x27;s presence. Alvin Plantinga argues that if beliefs formed by sensory experience can be considered properly basic, requiring no external justification, then beliefs in theism formed by a &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot; can be considered properly basic as well, and thus require no external justification. Research in the cognitive science of religion suggests that the human brain has a natural and evolutionary predisposition towards theistic beliefs, which Kelly James Clark argues is empirical evidence for the presence of a &quot;sensus divinitatis&quot;.

===== Rational warrant =====

Philosopher Stephen Toulmin is notable for his work in the history of ideas that features the (rational) warrant: a statement that connects the premises to a conclusion.

Joseph Hinman applied Toulmin&#x27;s approach in his argument for the existence of God, particularly in his book &quot;The Trace of God: A Rational Warrant for Belief&quot;. Instead of attempting to prove the existence of God, Hinman argues you can &quot;demonstrate the rationally-warranted nature of belief&quot;.

Hinman uses a wide range of studies, including ones by Robert Wuthnow, Andrew Greeley, Mathes and Kathleen Nobel to establish that mystical experiences are life-transformative in a way that is significant, positive and lasting. He draws on additional work to add several additional major points to his argument. First, the people who have these experiences not only do not exhibit traditional signs of mental illness but, often, are in better mental and physical health than the general population due to the experience. Second, the experiences work. In other words, they provide a framework for navigating life that is useful and effective. All of the evidence of the positive effects of the experience upon people&#x27;s lives he, adapting a term from Derrida, terms &quot;the trace of God&quot;: the footprints left behind that point to the impact.

Finally, he discusses how both religious experience and belief in God is, and has always been, normative among humans: people do not need to prove the existence of God. If there is no need to prove, Hinman argues, and the Trace of God (for instance, the impact of mystical experiences on them), belief in God is rationally warranted.

==== Inductive arguments ====

Some have put forward arguments for the existence of God based on inductive reasoning. For example, one class of philosophers asserts that the proofs for the existence of God present a fairly large probability though not absolute certainty. A number of obscure points, they say, always remain; an act of faith is required to dismiss these difficulties. This view is maintained, among others, by the Scottish statesman Arthur Balfour in his book &quot;The Foundations of Belief&quot; (1895). The opinions set forth in this work were adopted in France by Ferdinand Brunetière, the editor of the &quot;Revue des deux Mondes&quot;. Many orthodox Protestants express themselves in the same manner, as, for instance, Dr. E. Dennert, President of the Kepler Society, in his work &quot;Ist Gott tot?&quot;

==== Metaphysical arguments ====
===== Argument from degree =====
===== Argument from desire =====

C. S. Lewis, in &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; and elsewhere, posed that all natural desires have a natural object. One thirsts, and there exists water to quench this thirst; One hungers, and there exists food to satisfy this hunger. He then argued that the human desire for perfect justice, perfect peace, perfect happiness, and other intangibles strongly implies the existence of such things, though they seem unobtainable on earth. He further posed that the unquenchable desires of this life strongly imply that we are intended for a different life, necessarily governed by a God who can provide the desired intangibles.

===== Argument from love =====
===== Argument from mathematics =====

The argument from mathematics is presented by American philosopher William Lane Craig. In the philosophy of mathematics, the ontological status of mathematical entities, such as numbers, sets, and functions is debated. Within this philosophical context, two primary positions emerge: mathematical realism and mathematical anti-realism. Realists argue that mathematical objects exist independently of human thought as abstract, non-causal entities. In contrast, anti-realists deny the independent existence of these mathematical objects. A pivotal issue in this debate is the phenomenon that physicist Eugene Wigner termed &quot;the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.&quot; This refers to the ability of mathematics to describe and predict phenomena in the natural world, exemplified by theoretical physicist Peter Higgs&#x27; use of mathematical equations to predict the existence of a fundamental particle, which was verified experimentally decades later.

Craig posits that this effectiveness presents a significant philosophical question about the applicability of mathematics, regardless of one&#x27;s stance on the existence of mathematical entities. He argues that theism provides a more compelling framework for understanding this phenomenon than metaphysical naturalism. Under realism, non-theistic perspectives might view the alignment of mathematical abstractions with physical reality as a mere coincidence. However, a theistic realist might argue that this alignment is intentional, as a Supreme Being created the world based on these abstract mathematical structures. On the other hand, anti-realists, particularly those of a naturalistic persuasion, see mathematical relationships as reflections of real-world interactions, without necessitating abstract entities. Yet, Craig challenges this view by questioning why the physical world inherently exhibits such complex mathematical patterns without an intentional design. In contrast, the theistic anti-realist has a straightforward explanation: the world reflects a complex mathematical structure because it was created by God following an abstract model. Thus, Craig concludes that theism offers a superior explanation for why mathematics applies so effectively to understanding and predicting the physical world.

===== Argument from morality =====
===== Argument from reason =====
===== Transcendental argument =====
==== Subjective arguments ====
===== Argument from religious experience =====

The argument from religious experience holds that the best explanation for religious experiences is that they are actual perceptions of God&#x27;s presence. Philosopher Robert Sloan Lee notes that this argument possesses an &quot;unexpected resilience&quot; despite seemingly being able to be easily defeated by simple objections, such as pointing out the existence of hallucinations. Philosopher William J. Abraham states &quot;We do not generally believe that because some reports of ordinary natural objects sometimes involve illusion, hallucination, and the like, then all reports do so&quot;. He continues, &quot;If we insist that they apply only to religious experience, then we face the embarrassing fact that we apply standards in the religious sphere which we do not apply elsewhere&quot;.

===== Arguments from witnesses&#x27; testimony =====

Arguments from testimony rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, possibly embodying the propositions of a specific revealed religion. Swinburne argues that it is a principle of rationality that one should accept testimony unless there are strong reasons for not doing so.

* The witness argument gives credibility to personal witnesses, contemporary and throughout the ages. A variation of this is the argument from miracles (also referred to as &quot;the priest stories&quot;) which relies on testimony of supernatural events to establish the existence of God.
* The majority argument argues that the theism of people throughout most of recorded history and in many different places provides &quot;prima facie&quot; demonstration of God&#x27;s existence.
* Islam asserts that the revelation of its holy book, the Qur&#x27;an, and its unique literary attributes, vindicate its divine authorship, and thus the existence of God.
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as Mormonism, similarly asserts that the miraculous appearance of God, Jesus Christ, and angels to Joseph Smith and others and subsequent finding and translation of the Book of Mormon establishes the existence of God. The whole Latter Day Saint movement makes the same claim for example Community of Christ, Church of Christ (Temple Lot), Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), Church of Jesus Christ (Cutlerite), etc.
** The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), similarly asserts that the finding and translation of the Plates of Laban, also known as the Brass Plates, into the Book of the Law of the Lord and Voree plates by James Strang, One Mighty and Strong, establishes the existence of God.
** Various sects that have broken from the Church of Christ (Temple Lot) (such as Church of Christ &quot;With the Elijah Message&quot; and Church of Christ (Assured Way)) claim that the message brought by John the Baptist, One Mighty and Strong, to Otto Fetting and W. A. Draves in The Word of the Lord Brought to Mankind by an Angel establishes the existence of God.

====== Arguments from historical events ======
* Christianity and Judaism assert that God intervened in key specific moments in history, especially at the Exodus and the giving of the Ten Commandments in front of all the tribes of Israel, positing an argument from empirical evidence stemming from sheer number of witnesses, thus demonstrating his existence.
* Christological arguments assert that certain events of the Christian New Testament are historically accurate, and prove God&#x27;s existence, namely:
** The Resurrection of Jesus (an argument from miracles)

====== Arguments from the authority of historical personages ======
These arguments are an appeal to authority:
* The claims of Jesus, as a morally upstanding person, to be the son of God 
* Jesus, said to be a wise person, believed that God exists 
* The belief of Lekhraj Kripalani, who founded the Brahma Kumaris religion when God was said to enter his body

===== Anecdotal arguments =====

* The sincere seeker&#x27;s argument, espoused by Muslim Sufis of the Tasawwuf tradition, posits that every individual who follows a formulaic path towards guidance, arrives at the same destination of conviction in the existence of God and specifically in the monotheistic tenets and laws of Islam. This apparent natural law for guidance and belief could only be consistent if the formula and supplication were being answered by the same Divine entity being addressed, as claimed in Islamic revelations. This was formally organized by Imam Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali in such notable works as &quot;Deliverance from Error&quot; and &quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot;, in Arabic &quot;Kimiya-yi sa&#x27;ādat&quot;. The path includes following the golden rule of no harm to others and treating others with compassion, silence or minimal speech, seclusion, daily fasting or minimalist diet of water and basic nourishment, honest wages, and daily supplication towards &quot;the Creator of the Universe&quot; for guidance.
* The Argument from a proper basis argues that belief in God is &quot;properly basic&quot;; that it is similar to statements like &quot;I see a chair&quot; or &quot;I feel pain&quot;. Such beliefs are non-falsifiable and, thus, neither provable nor disprovable; they concern perceptual beliefs or indisputable mental states.
* In Germany, the School of Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi taught that human reason is able to perceive the suprasensible. Jacobi distinguished three faculties: sense, reason, and understanding. Just as sense has immediate perception of the material so has reason immediate perception of the immaterial, while the understanding brings these perceptions to a person&#x27;s consciousness and unites them to one another. God&#x27;s existence, then, cannot be proven (Jacobi, like Immanuel Kant, rejected the absolute value of the principle of causality), it must be felt by the mind.
* The same theory was advocated in Germany by Friedrich Schleiermacher, who assumed an inner religious sense by means of which people feel religious truths. According to Schleiermacher, religion consists solely in this inner perception, and dogmatic doctrines are inessential.

==== Hindu arguments ====

The school of Vedanta argues that one of the proofs of the existence of God is the law of karma. In a commentary to Brahma Sutras (III, 2, 38, and 41), Adi Sankara argues that the original karmic actions themselves cannot bring about the proper results at some future time; neither can super sensuous, non-intelligent qualities like adrsta by themselves mediate the appropriate, justly deserved pleasure and pain. The fruits, according to him must be administered through the action of a conscious agent, namely, a supreme being (Ishvara). The Nyaya school make similar arguments.

==== Other arguments ====

* The evolutionary argument against naturalism, which argues that naturalistic evolution is incapable of providing humans with the cognitive apparatus necessary for their knowledge to have positive epistemic status.
* An argument from belief in God being properly basic as presented by Alvin Plantinga.
* Argument from Personal Identity.
* Argument from the &quot;divine attributes of scientific law&quot;.

=== Arguments against the existence of God===
The arguments below aim to show that God does not exist—by showing a creator is unnecessary or contradictory, at odds with known scientific or historical facts, or that there is insufficient proof that God exists.

==== Logical arguments ====
The following arguments deduce, mostly through self-contradiction, the non-existence of God as &quot;the Creator&quot;.

* No scientific evidence of God&#x27;s existence has been found. Therefore, according to scientific skeptic or scientist worldviews, one should not believe in God; more philosophically, whether or not God exists is unknown, or even, God does not exist (depending on how strongly such worldviews are held; or, depending on how strongly one believes that there is no scientific evidence of God&#x27;s existence).
* Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book &quot;The Grand Design&quot; that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Christian scholars, like Leonhard Euler and Bernard d&#x27;Espagnat, disagree with that kind of skeptical argument.
* Dawkins&#x27; Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit analogizes the above. Some theists argue that evolution and abiogenesis are akin to a hurricane assembling a Boeing 747—that the universe (or life) is too complex, cannot be made by non-living matter alone and would have to be designed by someone, who theists call God. Dawkin&#x27;s counter-argument is that such a God would himself be complex—the &quot;Ultimate&quot; Boeing 747—and therefore require a designer.
* Theological noncognitivism is the argument that religious language – specifically, words such as &quot;God&quot; – are not cognitively meaningful and that irreducible definitions of God are circular.
* The analogy of Russell&#x27;s teapot argues that the burden of proof for the existence of God lies with the theist rather than the atheist; it can be considered an extension of Occam&#x27;s Razor.

===== Arguments from incompatible divine properties =====

Some arguments focus on the existence of specific conceptions of God as being omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect.

The Omnipotence Paradox

The Omnipotence Paradox is a philosophical problem that challenges the idea of an all-powerful God. The paradox argues that if God is truly omnipotent, then he should be able to do anything, including things that are logically impossible. However, if God cannot do something that is logically impossible, then he is not truly omnipotent. This paradox has been debated by philosophers for centuries and continues to be a topic of discussion in modern times.

The basic form of the Omnipotence Paradox can be presented as follows: Can God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? If God can create such a stone, then he is not omnipotent because he cannot lift it. If God cannot create such a stone, then he is also not omnipotent because there is something he cannot do.

One of the earliest recorded discussions of the Omnipotence Paradox can be found in the writings of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus. In his work &quot;Letter to Menoeceus,&quot; Epicurus argues that if God is truly omnipotent, then he should be able to prevent evil from existing in the world. However, since evil does exist, either God is not omnipotent or he is not benevolent.

Another version of the omnipotence paradox involves God&#x27;s ability to change the past. If God is truly omnipotent, then he should be able to change events that have already occurred. But if he can change the past, then he would be altering his own actions and decisions, which would mean that he was not truly free to act in the first place.

Another early discussion of the Omnipotence Paradox can be found in the writings of the medieval philosopher St. Thomas Aquinas. Aquinas argued that God&#x27;s omnipotence was limited by his own nature and by logical laws. He believed that God could not perform actions that were logically contradictory, such as creating a square circle or making 2+2=5.

One of the most famous versions of this paradox is the question: &quot;Can God create a being more powerful than himself?&quot; This question implies a contradiction because if God is truly omnipotent, then he should be able to create anything, including a being more powerful than himself. However, if such a being exists, then God would no longer be omnipotent.

The omniscience paradox

The omniscience paradox challenges the idea that God can know everything that will happen in the future. If God knows everything that will happen in advance, then it seems that human beings do not have free will. After all, if God already knows what we will do in every situation, then it seems that we cannot choose to do anything differently.

Another version of the omniscience paradox involves God&#x27;s knowledge of his own future actions. If God knows what he will do in advance, then it seems that he does not have the freedom to choose otherwise. But if he does not know what he will do, then he is not truly omniscient.

A more recent version of the omniscience paradox is the &quot;paradox of the stone tablet.&quot; This argument goes as follows: suppose that God writes down everything that will happen in the future on a stone tablet. If God is truly omniscient, then he already knows what is written on the tablet. But if what is written on the tablet is true, then it seems that human beings do not have free will.

The contradiction of omniscience and omnipotence

The contradiction of omniscience and omnipotence has been a topic of philosophical debate for centuries. The concept of omniscience refers to the idea that God knows everything, while omnipotence refers to the idea that God is all-powerful. The contradiction arises when one considers whether an all-knowing God can also be all-powerful. If God knows everything, then he must know what he will do in the future, and if he knows what he will do in the future, then he cannot change his mind and do something else. This would mean that God is not all-powerful because he is limited by his knowledge of the future. On the other hand, if God is all-powerful, then he should be able to change his mind and do something else, but if he does this, then he cannot be all-knowing because he did not know what he was going to do in the first place.

The problem of evil

The problem of evil against God is one of the most challenging philosophical and theological issues. It seeks to reconcile the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and benevolent God with the presence of evil and suffering in the world. This problem has been debated for centuries by philosophers, theologians, and scholars from different religious traditions.

The problem of evil can be formulated in different ways. One common formulation is the logical problem of evil, which argues that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with the existence of an all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good God. This argument goes as follows:

1. Suppose God is defined by the properties of being all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good.

2. If God is all-powerful, then he can prevent evil from occurring.

3. If God is all-knowing, then he knows where evil exists and knows how to eliminate evil.

4. If God is perfectly good, then he would want to prevent evil from occurring.

5. Evil exists.

6. Therefore, God does not exist.

This argument challenges the traditional concept of God as an omnipotent and omnibenevolent being who created the world and governs it with love and care. If such a God exists, why does he allow evil to happen? The existence of natural disasters, diseases, wars, crimes, and other forms of suffering seems to contradict the idea of a loving and compassionate God.

Another formulation of the problem of evil is the evidential problem of evil, which argues that while the existence of evil may not logically disprove the existence of God, it provides strong evidence against his existence. This argument acknowledges that it is possible for an all-powerful and all-good God to have reasons for allowing evil to occur that are beyond our understanding. However, it contends that the sheer amount and intensity of evil in the world make it highly unlikely that such reasons exist.

The problem of evil has been a central concern in the philosophy of religion since ancient times. In his dialogue &quot;The Euthyphro,&quot; Plato raises the question of whether the gods love what is good because it is good, or whether it is good because the gods love it. This question raises the issue of whether morality is independent of God or dependent on him. If morality is independent of God, then God may not be necessary for moral values and duties to exist. If morality is dependent on God, then it raises the problem of whether God&#x27;s commands are arbitrary or whether there is a reason behind them.

The problem of divine immutability

The problem of divine immutability is a philosophical and theological issue that has been debated for centuries. At the heart of the problem is the question of whether or not God can change. This question has far-reaching implications for how we understand the nature of God, the relationship between God and creation, and the problem of evil.

One of the main arguments for divine immutability is based on the idea that God is perfect and complete in all respects. According to this view, if God were to change in any way, it would imply that there was something lacking or imperfect in God&#x27;s nature. This would be inconsistent with the idea of a perfect and complete being.

Another argument for divine immutability is based on the idea that God exists outside of time. According to this view, God&#x27;s nature is eternal and unchanging, and therefore cannot be affected by anything that happens within time. This means that God cannot change in response to events in the world, since these events are themselves temporal and subject to change.

However, there are also a number of arguments against divine immutability. One of these is based on the idea that if God cannot change, then it would be impossible for God to interact with the world in any meaningful way. According to this view, if God&#x27;s nature is fixed and unchanging, then there can be no real relationship between God and creation.

Another argument against divine immutability is based on the problem of evil. If God cannot change, then it would seem that God must have always known about and allowed for the existence of evil in the world. This raises questions about how we can reconcile a perfectly good and loving God with a world that contains so much suffering and injustice.

The problem of hell

This is one of the most difficult challenges to the existence of God. The basic argument is that if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and perfectly good, then why would he create a place of eternal punishment like hell? This question has been debated by philosophers and theologians for centuries.

The problem of hell can be traced to ancient times. The concept of an afterlife was common in many cultures, but the idea of eternal punishment was not. The ancient Greeks believed in a realm called Hades where the dead went, but it was not a place of punishment. The ancient Egyptians believed in a judgment after death that determined whether a person would go to a good or bad afterlife, but again, it was not eternal punishment. It was not until the rise of Christianity that the concept of eternal punishment in hell became widespread.

The Christian concept of hell is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Bible. According to Christian theology, hell is a place of eternal punishment for those who have rejected God and lived sinful lives. It is often described as a place of fire and torment where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth. The idea of eternal punishment in hell has been controversial throughout Christian history.

One argument against the existence of God based on the problem of hell is that it seems incompatible with God&#x27;s perfect goodness. If God is perfectly good, then why would he create a place like hell where people suffer for eternity? This argument has been made by many philosophers throughout history.

Transcendental Argument for the Non-existence of God (TANG)

The Transcendental Argument for the Non-Existence of God (TANG) is a philosophical argument that attempts to demonstrate the non-existence of God by showing that the concept of God is logically incompatible with certain necessary conditions for rationality. The argument is based on the idea that if certain necessary conditions for rationality are true, then the existence of God is impossible. The proponents of TANG argue that it is a powerful argument against theism, and it has been the subject of much debate in philosophical circles.

The basic structure of TANG can be summarized as follows:

1. If rationality exists, then certain necessary conditions for rationality must be true.

2. The existence of God is logically incompatible with these necessary conditions for rationality.

3. Therefore, if these necessary conditions for rationality are true, then the existence of God is impossible.

The proponents of TANG argue that there are three necessary conditions for rationality:

1. The laws of logic are valid.

2. Our cognitive faculties are reliable.

3. There is an objective moral standard.

According to TANG, if these three necessary conditions are true, then the existence of God is impossible.

Firstly, proponents of TANG argue that the laws of logic are valid and necessary for rationality. They contend that if the laws of logic were not valid, then we could not reason or make sense of anything. Therefore, they argue that it is necessary for rationality that the laws of logic be valid and universally applicable.

Secondly, proponents of TANG argue that our cognitive faculties must be reliable in order for us to reason rationally. They contend that if our cognitive faculties were not reliable, then we could not trust our own reasoning processes and would have no basis for knowledge or belief. Therefore, they argue that it is necessary for rationality that our cognitive faculties be reliable.

Finally, proponents of TANG argue that there must be an objective moral standard in order for us to reason rationally. They contend that if there were no objective moral standard, then we could not make moral judgments or reason about ethical issues. Therefore, they argue that it is necessary for rationality that there be an objective moral standard.

Proponents of TANG argue that the existence of God is logically incompatible with these necessary conditions for rationality. They contend that if God exists, then the laws of logic are contingent on his will and could be different from what they are. They also argue that if God exists, then our cognitive faculties are contingent on his will and could be unreliable. Finally, they argue that if God exists, then morality is contingent on his will and there is no objective moral standard.

Therefore, proponents of TANG conclude that if these necessary conditions for rationality are true, then the existence of God is impossible. They argue that the concept of God is logically incompatible with these necessary conditions and therefore cannot exist.

Atheist-Existential Argument

The atheist-existential argument posits that human existence is characterized by absurdity, meaninglessness, and despair. According to this argument, humans are finite beings living in an infinite universe, and their existence is devoid of any inherent purpose or meaning. Proponents of this argument contend that if God existed, He would have provided humanity with a clear purpose and meaning for existence. However, since no such purpose or meaning exists, it follows that God does not exist.

Jean-Paul Sartre was one of the most prominent proponents of the atheist-existential argument. In his book &quot;Existentialism is a Humanism,&quot; Sartre argues that human existence is absurd because there is no inherent purpose or meaning to life. He contends that humans are free to create their own meaning and purpose but are ultimately responsible for their choices and actions. Sartre asserts that if God existed, He would have provided humanity with a clear purpose and meaning for existence. However, since no such purpose or meaning exists, it follows that God does not exist.

Similarly, Friedrich Nietzsche argues in his book &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot; that human existence is meaningless because there is no inherent purpose or meaning to life. Nietzsche contends that humans must create their own values and meanings, and that the concept of God is a human invention that serves as a crutch for those who cannot accept the absurdity of existence. Nietzsche asserts that the death of God is a necessary step in human evolution, as it allows humanity to embrace its freedom and create its own values and meanings.

Albert Camus also presents a similar argument in his book &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. Camus argues that human existence is absurd because there is no inherent purpose or meaning to life. He contends that humans must create their own meaning in the face of this absurdity, and that the concept of God is a distraction from this task. Camus asserts that the only way to confront the absurdity of existence is through rebellion, which involves embracing life despite its lack of inherent meaning.

Martin Heidegger also presents an existentialist argument for the non-existence of God in his book &quot;Being and Time&quot;. Heidegger contends that human existence is characterized by anxiety and dread because humans are aware of their mortality and the ultimate futility of their actions. He argues that if God existed, He would have provided humanity with a clear purpose and meaning for existence, thus alleviating this anxiety. However, since no such purpose or meaning exists, it follows that God does not exist.

The &quot;no reason&quot; argument

The &quot;no reason&quot; argument tries to show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, because it would have no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by Scott Adams in the book &quot;God&#x27;s Debris&quot;, which puts forward a form of Pandeism as its fundamental theological model. A similar argument is put forward in Ludwig von Mises&#x27;s &quot;Human Action&quot;. He referred to it as the &quot;praxeological argument&quot; and claimed that a perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would no longer be able to take action in the present without proving that it had been unable to achieve its wants faster—showing it imperfect.

The argument is based on the idea that if something exists, there must be a reason or explanation for its existence. Therefore, if God exists, there must be a reason or explanation for his existence. However, proponents of the &quot;no reason&quot; argument argue that there is no reason or explanation for God&#x27;s existence, and therefore he does not exist.

One of the main proponents of the &quot;no reason&quot; argument is J. L. Mackie. In his book &quot;The Miracle of Theism: Arguments For and Against the Existence of God&quot;, Mackie argues that the concept of an uncaused cause, which is often used to explain God&#x27;s existence, is flawed. He argues that if everything must have a cause or explanation for its existence, then God must also have a cause or explanation for his existence. However, since God is often described as an uncaused cause, this creates a contradiction in the concept of God.

Another proponent of the &quot;no reason&quot; argument is Bertrand Russell. In his book &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot;, Russell argues that the concept of God as an uncaused cause is illogical. He argues that if everything must have a cause or explanation for its existence, then God must also have a cause or explanation for his existence. However, since God is often described as an uncaused cause, this creates a contradiction in the concept of God.

Furthermore, proponents of the &quot;no reason&quot; argument argue that the burden of proof lies with those who claim that God exists. They argue that since there is no evidence or reason to believe in God&#x27;s existence, it is more reasonable to assume that he does not exist.

In addition to these arguments, proponents of the &quot;no reason&quot; argument also point to the problem of evil as evidence against God&#x27;s existence. They argue that if God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good, then he would not allow evil to exist in the world for any reason. He would have no specific reason for doing so. However, since evil does exist and is allowed to, this creates a contradiction in the concept of God.

==== Empirical arguments ====

The following empirical arguments rely on observations or experimentation to yield their conclusions.

Argument from naturalism

The argument from naturalism is a philosophical argument that asserts that the natural world is all there is and that supernatural explanations are unnecessary. This argument is based on the premise that the universe operates according to natural laws and that these laws can be discovered through scientific inquiry. The argument from naturalism has been a topic of debate among philosophers for centuries, with proponents and opponents presenting various arguments and counterarguments.

The argument from naturalism can be traced to ancient Greek philosophy, where philosophers such as Democritus and Epicurus argued that the universe was composed of atoms and void, with no need for supernatural explanations. However, it was not until the Enlightenment period in the 18th century that naturalism became a dominant philosophical position. During this time, philosophers such as David Hume and Immanuel Kant argued that knowledge could only be derived from empirical observation and rational analysis, without recourse to supernatural explanations.

One of the key premises of the argument from naturalism is that the natural world is all there is. According to this view, there are no supernatural entities or forces that exist beyond the physical realm. This premise is based on the assumption that everything in the universe operates according to natural laws, which can be discovered through scientific inquiry. As philosopher Paul Kurtz states, &quot;the naturalistic outlook holds that nature is a self-contained system of physical causes and effects&quot;

Another important premise of the argument from naturalism is that supernatural explanations are unnecessary. According to this view, any phenomenon in the universe can be explained through natural causes and processes, without invoking supernatural entities or forces. This premise is based on the assumption that naturalistic explanations are sufficient to account for all observed phenomena. As philosopher William L. Rowe states, &quot;Naturalism holds that there is no need to postulate any supernatural entities or forces in order to explain the world&quot;.

Proponents of the argument from naturalism argue that naturalistic explanations are more parsimonious than supernatural explanations. This means that naturalistic explanations are simpler and require fewer assumptions than supernatural explanations. For example, if a person observes a tree falling, a naturalistic explanation would be that the tree fell due to gravity, whereas a supernatural explanation would be that a deity caused the tree to fall. The naturalistic explanation is simpler and requires fewer assumptions than the supernatural explanation.

Opponents of the argument from naturalism argue that there are phenomena in the universe that cannot be explained through naturalistic causes and processes. These phenomena are often referred to as &quot;supernatural&quot; or &quot;paranormal&quot; and include things like miracles, psychic abilities, and near-death experiences. According to opponents of naturalism, these phenomena require supernatural explanations.

However, proponents of the argument from naturalism counter that there is no empirical evidence to support supernatural explanations for these phenomena. They argue that many supposed supernatural phenomena can be explained through naturalistic causes and processes. For example, near-death experiences can be explained through changes in brain chemistry and oxygen deprivation, rather than as evidence of an afterlife.

The Argument from Evolution

The Argument from Evolution against God&#x27;s existence is a philosophical argument that attempts to prove the non-existence of God by using the theory of evolution. The argument is based on the idea that the theory of evolution provides a natural explanation for the diversity of life on Earth, and therefore, there is no need to invoke a divine creator.

The theory of evolution was first proposed by Charles Darwin in his book &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859. According to the theory, all living organisms have evolved over time from a common ancestor through a process of natural selection. Natural selection is the process by which certain traits become more or less common in a population over time depending on their usefulness for survival and reproduction. Over millions of years, this process has led to the vast diversity of life we see on Earth today.

One of the key arguments against God&#x27;s existence based on evolution is known as the argument from imperfection. This argument suggests that if God were responsible for creating all life on Earth, then why would he create imperfect organisms? For example, why would he create animals with vestigial organs that serve no purpose or cause suffering?

Another argument against God&#x27;s existence based on evolution is known as the argument from bad design. This argument suggests that if God were responsible for creating all life on Earth, then why would he create organisms with such poor design features? For example, why would he create animals with eyes that are poorly designed or prone to disease?

The Euthyphro dilemma

The Euthyphro dilemma is a philosophical problem that raises questions about the relationship between morality and God&#x27;s existence. The dilemma was first presented by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato in his dialogue &quot;Euthyphro.&quot; The dilemma asks whether something is morally good because God commands it, or whether God commands it because it is morally good. This dilemma has been used as an argument against the existence of God, as it seems to suggest that either God is not necessary for morality or that God&#x27;s commands are arbitrary and not based on any objective standard of morality.

The first horn of the dilemma suggests that something is morally good because God commands it. This view is known as divine command theory, which states that moral truths are grounded in God&#x27;s will or commands. According to this view, God&#x27;s commands determine what is right and wrong, and morality is dependent on God&#x27;s existence. If God did not exist, then there would be no objective basis for morality.

The second horn of the dilemma suggests that God commands something because it is morally good. This view implies that there is an objective standard of morality that exists independently of God&#x27;s will. In other words, God recognizes what is morally good and commands us to follow it. This view is known as moral realism, which holds that moral truths exist independently of human opinion or belief.

Critics of the divine command theory argue that it leads to a problematic conclusion: if something is morally good simply because God commands it, then anything could be considered morally good if God commanded it. For example, if God commanded us to kill innocent people, then killing innocent people would be considered morally good according to divine command theory. This seems to suggest that morality is arbitrary and dependent on God&#x27;s whims rather than being grounded in any objective standard.

On the other hand, critics of moral realism argue that it raises questions about the nature of morality itself. If there is an objective standard of morality that exists independently of God&#x27;s will, then what is the source of this standard? Is it a natural law, or is it something else entirely? Furthermore, if there is an objective standard of morality, then why do different cultures and societies have different moral codes? This seems to suggest that morality is not as objective as moral realists claim.

The problem of anthropic argument

The anthropic argument is a philosophical and theological concept that argues that the universe and its physical laws are finely tuned to allow for the existence of life and, therefore, must have been designed by an intelligent creator. Proponents of this argument claim that the odds of the universe existing as it does by chance are so astronomically low that it is more reasonable to believe in a creator than not. However, opponents of the anthropic argument argue that it is flawed and does not necessarily prove the existence of God.

One of the main criticisms of the anthropic argument is that it suffers from the fallacy of selection bias. This is because proponents only consider the universe as it exists today, without taking into account all the other possible ways it could have existed. For example, if the physical laws were different, life as we know it may not have been possible, but that does not mean that some other form of life could not have existed under those conditions. Therefore, opponents argue that just because our universe allows for life does not necessarily mean that it was designed to do so.

Another criticism of the anthropic argument is that it assumes that life is inherently valuable and important. Opponents argue that this is a subjective value judgment and cannot be used as evidence for the existence of God. Additionally, opponents point out that there are many aspects of the universe that are not conducive to life, such as black holes or supernovae, which could be seen as evidence against a benevolent creator.

Furthermore, opponents argue that the anthropic argument is based on a flawed understanding of probability. They claim that just because something is unlikely does not mean it is impossible, and therefore, low probabilities cannot be used as evidence for design. Additionally, opponents argue that probability calculations can only be made if all possible outcomes are known, which is impossible in the case of the universe.

Opponents of the anthropic argument also point out that there are alternative explanations for the fine-tuning of the universe. Some scientists propose the multiverse theory, which suggests that our universe is just one of many possible universes, each with its own set of physical laws. In this scenario, it is not surprising that we find ourselves in a universe that allows for life because we could not exist in any other type of universe. Other scientists suggest that the physical constants of the universe are not actually fixed but can vary over time, which could explain why our universe appears to be finely tuned for life.

Argument from the problem of miracles

The problem of miracles is rooted in the concept of natural law, which assumes that the universe operates according to predictable and consistent laws. According to this view, any event that violates natural law, such as a miracle, cannot occur. Therefore, if a miracle is claimed to have occurred, it must be either a misunderstanding or a deliberate deception.

One of the most prominent advocates of the problem of miracles was the Scottish philosopher David Hume. In his essay &quot;Of Miracles,&quot; Hume argued that it is always more reasonable to believe that someone is mistaken or lying than to accept that a miracle has occurred. He claimed that there is no amount of testimony or evidence that can prove a miracle beyond doubt because it always contradicts natural law. Hume&#x27;s argument was based on his empiricist philosophy, which held that all knowledge comes from sensory experience and that claims about supernatural events are not supported by such experience.

The argument from the problem of religious experience

This argument suggests that religious experiences are subjective and cannot be verified or falsified, making them unreliable as evidence for the existence of God.

The argument from the problem of religious experience against God&#x27;s existence can be formulated as follows:

1. Religious experiences are subjective and cannot be verified or falsified.

2. If religious experiences cannot be verified or falsified, then they are unreliable as evidence for the existence of God.

3. Therefore, religious experiences are unreliable as evidence for the existence of God.

Premise 1 is based on the fact that religious experiences are personal and subjective. They are often described in terms of feelings, emotions, and sensations that are difficult to describe or measure objectively. For example, a person may claim to have had a mystical experience in which they felt a deep sense of unity with all things. However, this experience cannot be objectively measured or verified by others. It is purely subjective and exists only in the mind of the individual who had it.

Premise 2 follows logically from premise 1. If religious experiences cannot be verified or falsified, then they cannot be used as evidence to support any particular belief about God&#x27;s existence or nature. This is because there is no way to distinguish between genuine religious experiences and mere hallucinations or delusions. Without objective criteria for verifying or falsifying religious experiences, they remain purely subjective and cannot be used as evidence in any rational debate about the existence of God.

Premise 3 is the conclusion that follows logically from premises 1 and 2. If religious experiences are unreliable as evidence for the existence of God, then they cannot be used to support any argument for the existence of God. This means that any argument that relies on religious experiences as evidence for God&#x27;s existence is inherently flawed and cannot be taken seriously by those who demand objective evidence for their beliefs.

===== Argument from inconsistent revelations =====

===== Argument from parsimony =====

The argument from parsimony (using Occam&#x27;s razor) contends that since natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the development of religion and belief in gods, the actual existence of such supernatural agents is superfluous and may be dismissed unless otherwise proven to be required to explain the phenomenon.

===== Argument from historical induction =====

The argument from &quot;historical induction&quot; concludes that since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. ancient Egyptian religion, ancient Greek religion) and their gods ultimately come to be regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. H. L. Mencken wrote a short piece about the topic entitled &quot;Memorial Service&quot; in 1922. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts&#x27; popular quotation:

I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.

===== Argument from nonbelief =====

===== Arguments from the poor design of the universe =====

The problem of evil contests the existence of a god who is both omnipotent and omnibenevolent by arguing that such a god should not permit the existence of evil or suffering. The theist responses are called theodicies. Similarly, the argument from poor design contends that an all-powerful, benevolent creator god would not have created lifeforms, including humans, which seem to exhibit poor design.

Richard Carrier has argued that the universe itself seems to be very ill-designed for life, because the vast majority of the space in the universe is utterly hostile to it. This is arguably unexpected on the hypothesis that the universe was designed by a god, especially a personal god. Carrier contends that such a god could have easily created a geocentric universe &quot;ex nihilo&quot; in the recent past, in which most of the volume of the universe is inhabitable by humans and other lifeforms—precisely the kind of universe that most humans believed in until the rise of modern science. While a personal god &quot;might&quot; have created the kind of universe we observe, Carrier contends that this is not the kind of universe we would most &quot;likely&quot; expect to see if such a god existed. He finally argues that, unlike theism, our observations about the nature of the universe are strongly expected on the hypothesis of atheism, since the universe would have to be vast, very old, and almost completely devoid of life if life were to have arisen by sheer chance.

==== Subjective arguments ====

Similar to the arguments for the existence of God, subjective arguments against God&#x27;s existence mainly rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, or the propositions of a revealed religion in general.

* The witness argument gives credibility to personal witnesses, contemporary and from the past, who disbelieve or strongly doubt the existence of God.
* The conflicted religions argument notes that many religions give differing accounts as to what God is and what God wants; since all the contradictory accounts cannot be correct, many if not all religions must be incorrect.
* The disappointment argument claims that if, when asked for, there is no visible help from God, there is no reason to believe that there is a God.

==== Hindu arguments ====

Atheistic Hindu doctrines cite various arguments for rejecting a creator God or &quot;Ishvara&quot;. The &quot;IAST&quot; of the Samkhya school states that there is no philosophical place for a creator God in this system. It is also argued in this text that the existence of Ishvara (God) cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. Classical Samkhya argues against the existence of God on metaphysical grounds. For instance, it argues that an unchanging God cannot be the source of an ever-changing world. It says God is a necessary metaphysical assumption demanded by circumstances. The Sutras of Samkhya endeavor to prove that the idea of God is inconceivable and self-contradictory, and some commentaries speak plainly on this subject. The &quot;Sankhya- tattva-kaumudi&quot;, commenting on Karika 57, argues that a perfect God can have no need to create a world, and if God&#x27;s motive is kindness, Samkhya questions whether it is reasonable to call into existence beings who while non-existent had no suffering. Samkhya postulates that a benevolent deity ought to create only happy creatures, not an imperfect world like the real world.

According to Sinha, the following arguments were given by Samkhya philosophers against the idea of an eternal, self-caused, creator God:

* If the existence of karma is assumed, the proposition of God as a moral governor of the universe is unnecessary. For, if God enforces the consequences of actions then he can do so without karma. If however, he is assumed to be within the law of karma, then karma itself would be the giver of consequences and there would be no need of a God.
* Even if karma is denied, God still cannot be the enforcer of consequences. Because the motives of an enforcer God would be either egoistic or altruistic. Now, God&#x27;s motives cannot be assumed to be altruistic because an altruistic God would not create a world so full of suffering. If his motives are assumed to be egoistic, then God must be thought to have desire, as agency or authority cannot be established in the absence of desire. However, assuming that God has desire would contradict God&#x27;s eternal freedom which necessitates no compulsion in actions. Moreover, desire, according to Samkhya, is an attribute of prakṛti and cannot be thought to grow in God. 
* Despite arguments to the contrary, if God is still assumed to contain unfulfilled desires, this would cause him to suffer pain and other similar human experiences. Such a worldly God would be no better than Samkhya&#x27;s notion of higher self.
* Furthermore, there is no proof of the existence of God. He is not the object of perception, there exists no general proposition that can prove him by inference.

Therefore, Samkhya maintained that the various cosmological, ontological and teleological arguments could not prove God.

Proponents of the school of Mimamsa, which is based on rituals and orthopraxy, decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God is insufficient. They argue that there is no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there is no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a god to validate the rituals. Mimamsa argues that the gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the &quot;mantras&quot; that speak their names. In that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of gods.

== Psychological aspects ==


Several authors have offered psychological or sociological explanations for belief in the existence of deities.

Psychologists observe that the majority of humans often ask existential questions such as &quot;why we are here&quot; and whether life has purpose. Some psychologists have posited that religious beliefs may recruit cognitive mechanisms in order to satisfy these questions. William James emphasized the inner religious struggle between melancholy and happiness, and pointed to trance as a cognitive mechanism. Sigmund Freud stressed fear and pain, the need for a powerful parental figure, the obsessional nature of ritual, and the hypnotic state a community can induce as contributing factors to the psychology of religion.

Pascal Boyer&#x27;s &quot;Religion Explained&quot; (2002), based in part on his anthropological field work, treats belief in God as the result of the brain&#x27;s tendency towards agency detection. Boyer suggests that, because of evolutionary pressures, humans err on the side of attributing agency where there is not any. In Boyer&#x27;s view, belief in supernatural entities spreads and becomes culturally fixed because of their memorability. The concept of &quot;minimally counterintuitive&quot; beings that differ from the ordinary in a small number of ways (such as being invisible, able to fly, or having access to strategic and otherwise secret information) leave a lasting impression that spreads through word-of-mouth.

Scott Atran&#x27;s &quot;In Gods We Trust: The Evolutionary Landscape of Religion&quot; (2002) makes a similar argument and adds examination of the socially coordinating aspects of shared belief. In &quot;Minds and Gods: The Cognitive Foundations of Religion&quot;, Todd Tremlin follows Boyer in arguing that universal human cognitive process naturally produces the concept of the supernatural. Tremlin contends that an agency detection device (ADD) and a theory of mind module (ToMM) lead humans to suspect an agent behind every event. Natural events for which there is no obvious agent may be attributed to God (c.f. Act of God).

<text>In mathematical logic, interpretability is a relation between formal theories that expresses the possibility of interpreting or translating one into the other.

==Informal definition==
Assume &quot;T&quot; and &quot;S&quot; are formal theories. Slightly simplified, &quot;T&quot; is said to be &quot;interpretable&quot; in &quot;S&quot; if and only if the language of &quot;T&quot; can be translated into the language of &quot;S&quot; in such a way that &quot;S&quot; proves the translation of every theorem of &quot;T&quot;. Of course, there are some natural conditions on admissible translations here, such as the necessity for a translation to preserve the logical structure of formulas.

This concept, together with weak interpretability, was introduced by Alfred Tarski in 1953. Three other related concepts are cointerpretability, logical tolerance, and cotolerance, introduced by Giorgi Japaridze in 1992–93.

<doc id="621178" wikidata="Q59532" url="?curid=621178" title="Christianization">
<text>Christianization (or Christianisation) is a term for the specific type of change that occurs when someone or something has been or is being converted to Christianity. Christianization has, for the most part, spread through missions by individual conversions, but has also, in some instances, been the result of violence by individuals and groups such as governments and militaries. Christianization is also the term used to designate the conversion of previously non-Christian practices, spaces and places to Christian uses and names. In a third manner, the term has been used to describe the changes that naturally emerge in a nation when sufficient numbers of individuals convert, or when secular leaders require those changes. Christianization of a nation is an ongoing process.

It began in the Roman Empire when the early individual followers of Jesus became itinerant preachers in response to the command recorded in Matthew 28:19 (sometimes called the Great Commission) to go to all the nations of the world and preach the good news of the gospel of Jesus. Christianization spread through the Roman Empire and into its surrounding nations in its first three hundred years. The process of Christianizing the Roman Empire was never completed, and Armenia became the first nation to designate Christianity as its state religion in 301.

After 479, Christianization spread through missions north into western Europe. In the High and Late Middle Ages, Christianization was instrumental in the creation of new nations in what became Eastern Europe, and in the spread of literacy there. In the modern era, Christianization became associated with colonialism, which, in an almost equal distribution, missionaries both participated in and opposed. In the post-colonial era, it has produced dramatic growth in China as well as in many former colonial lands in much of Africa. Christianization has become a diverse, pluralist, global phenomenon of the largest religion in the world.

== Missions ==
Historian Dana L. Robert has written that the significant role of Christianization in shaping multiple nations, cultures and societies is understandable only through the concept of Christian mission. Missionaries &quot;go out&quot; among those who have not heard the gospel and preach. Missions, as the primary means of Christianization, are driven by a universalist logic, cannot be equated with western colonialism, but are instead a multi-cultural, often complex, historical process.

David Abulafia and Nóra Berend speak of religious activity in relation to the &quot;frontier&quot; regions at the borders of civilizations. Berend sees a frontier as &quot;a contact zone where an interchange of cultures was constantly taking place&quot;. In this way, the missionary religions of Buddhism, Islam and Christianity spread themselves geographically, through teaching and preaching, with interaction sometimes producing conflict, and other times &quot;mingling&quot; and accommodation.

Alan Neely writes that, &quot;wherever Christianity (or any other faith) is carried from one culture to another, intentionally or not, consciously or not, it is either adapted to that culture or it becomes irrelevant.&quot; In his book &quot;Christian Mission,&quot; Neely provides multiple historical examples of adaptation, accommodation, indigenization, inculturation, autochthonization and contextualization as the means of successful Christianization through missions. Neely&#x27;s definitions are these:

* Accommodation is a form of adaptation that occurs when the missionary adjusts their own thinking and vocabulary to keep only what is essential and let go of what is expendable in communicating the faith. 
* Indigenization, in this application, refers to taking something that is native to one culture and making it native to another culture; that is, taking Christianity and making it more native by including aspects of native language and practices.
* Autochthonization means the same as indigenization, but is specific to Spanish and Portuguese.
* Inculturation, or acculturation, is the gradual process of adopting aspects of Christianity, but it has often mistakenly been seen as socialization to another culture. Changes of dress, customs and names have sometimes been confused with actual Christianization which involves internal and not simply external changes. Whenever the gospel has been linked to a particular culture, Gustavo Gutiérrez forcefully insists the result has been subjugation not conversion.
* Contextualization is a way to be faithful to the essence of the message while also being relevant to the people to whom it is being presented. In the 21st century, contextualization has led missions to build daycare centers, wells for clean water, schools, address housing and economic injustice issues and more. It depends on the people being addressed, as well as &quot;geography, language, ethnicity, political and economic systems, class gender and age, time frame, sense of identity, religion, values and history&quot;.

== Individual conversion ==

James P. Hanigan writes that individual conversion is the foundational experience and the central message of Christianization, adding that Christian conversion begins with an experience of being &quot;thrown off balance&quot; through cognitive and psychological &quot;disequilibrium&quot;, followed by an &quot;awakening&quot; of consciousness and a new awareness of God. Hanigan compares it to &quot;death and rebirth, a turning away..., a putting off of the old..., a change of mind and heart&quot;. The person responds by acknowledging and confessing personal lostness and sinfulness, and then accepting a call to holiness thus restoring balance. This initial internal conversion is only the beginning of Christianization; it is followed by practices that further the process of Christianizing the individual&#x27;s lifestyle, which according to Hanigan, will include ethical changes.

While Christian theologians such as the fourth century Augustine and the ninth century Alcuin maintained that conversion must be voluntary, there are historical examples of coercion in conversion. Constantine used both law and force to eradicate the practice of sacrifice and repress heresy though not specifically to promote conversion. Theodosius also wrote laws to eliminate heresies, but made no requirement for pagans or Jews to convert to Christianity. However, the sixth century Eastern Roman emperor Justinian I and the seventh century emperor Heraclius attempted to force cultural and religious uniformity by requiring baptism of the Jews. In 612, the Visigothic King Sisebut, prompted by Heraclius, declared the obligatory conversion of all Jews in Spain. In the many new nation-states being formed in Eastern Europe of the Late Middle Ages, some kings and princes pressured their people to adopt the new religion. And in the Northern crusades, the fighting princes obtained widespread conversion through political pressure or military coercion.

=== Baptism ===
Jesus began his ministry after his baptism by John the Baptist which can be dated to approximately AD 28–35 based on references by the Jewish historian Josephus in his ().

Individual conversion is followed by the initiation rite of baptism. In Christianity&#x27;s earliest communities, candidates for baptism were introduced by someone willing to stand surety for their character and conduct. Baptism created a set of responsibilities within the Christian community. Candidates for baptism were instructed in the major tenets of the faith, examined for moral living, sat separately in worship, were not yet allowed to receive the communion eucharist, but were still generally expected to demonstrate commitment to the community, and obedience to Christ&#x27;s commands, before being accepted into the community as a full member. This could take months to years.

The normal practice in the ancient church was baptism by immersion of the whole head and body of an adult, with the exception of infants in danger of death, until the fifth or sixth century. Historian Philip Schaff has written that sprinkling, or pouring of water on the head of a sick or dying person, where immersion was impractical, was also practiced in ancient times and up through the twelfth century. Infant baptism was controversial for the Protestant Reformers, but according to Schaff, it was practiced by the ancients and is neither required nor forbidden in the New Testament.

=== Eucharist ===

The celebration of the eucharist (also called communion) was the common unifier for early Christian communities, and remains one of the most important of Christian rituals. Early Christians believed the Christian message, the celebration of communion (the Eucharist) and the rite of baptism came directly from Jesus of Nazareth.

Father Enrico Mazza writes that the &quot;Eucharist is an imitation of the Last Supper&quot; when Jesus gathered his followers for their last meal together the night before he was arrested and killed. While the majority share the view of Mazza, there are others such as New Testament scholar Bruce Chilton who argue that there were multiple origins of the Eucharist.

In the Middle Ages, the Eucharist came to be understood as a sacrament (wherein God is present) that evidenced Christ&#x27;s sacrifice, and the prayer given with the rite was to include two strophes of thanksgiving and one of petition. The prayer later developed into the modern version of a narrative, a memorial to Christ and an invocation of the Holy Spirit.

=== Confirmation ===
In the early 1500s, confirmation was added to the rites of initiation. While baptism, instruction, and Eucharist have remained the essential elements of initiation in all Christian communities, theologian Knut Alfsvåg writes on the differing status of confirmation in different denominations:Some see baptism, confirmation, and first communion as different elements in a unified rite through which one becomes a part of the Christian church. Others consider confirmation a separate rite which may or may not be considered a condition for becoming a fully accepted member of the church in the sense that one is invited to take part in the celebration of the Eucharist. Among those who see confirmation as a separate rite some see it as a sacrament, while others consider it a combination of intercessory prayer and graduation ceremony after a period of instruction.

== Places and practices ==

Christianization has at times involved appropriation, removal and/or redesignation of aspects of native religion and former sacred spaces. This was allowed, or required, or sometimes forbidden by the missionaries involved. The church adapts to its local cultural context, just as local culture and places are adapted to the church, or in other words, Christianization has always worked in both directions: Christianity absorbs from native culture as it is absorbed into it.

When Christianity spread beyond Judaea, it first arrived in Jewish diaspora communities. The Christian church was modeled on the synagogue, and Christian philosophers synthesized their Christian views with Semitic monotheism and Greek thought. The Latin church adopted aspects of Platonic thought and used the Latin names for months and weekdays that etymologically derived from Roman mythology.

Christian art in the catacombs beneath Rome rose out of a reinterpretation of Jewish and pagan symbolism. While many new subjects appear for the first time in the Christian catacombs – i.e. the Good Shepherd, Baptism, and the Eucharistic meal – the Orant figures (women praying with upraised hands) probably came directly from pagan art.

Bruce David Forbes says &quot;Some way or another, Christmas was started to compete with rival Roman religions, or to co-opt the winter celebrations as a way to spread Christianity, or to baptize the winter festivals with Christian meaning in an effort to limit their [drunken] excesses. Most likely all three&quot;. Michelle Salzman has shown that, in the process of converting the Roman Empire&#x27;s aristocracy, Christianity absorbed the values of that aristocracy.

Some scholars have suggested that characteristics of some pagan gods — or at least their roles — were transferred to Christian saints after the fourth century. Demetrius of Thessaloniki became venerated as the patron of agriculture during the Middle Ages. According to historian Hans Kloft, that was because the Eleusinian Mysteries, Demeter&#x27;s cult, ended in the 4th century, and the Greek rural population gradually transferred her rites and roles onto the Christian saint.

Several early Christian writers, including Justin (2nd century), Tertullian, and Origen (3rd century) wrote of Mithraists copying Christian beliefs and practices yet remaining pagan.

In both Jewish and Roman tradition, genetic families were buried together, but an important cultural shift took place in the way Christians buried one another: they gathered unrelated Christians into a common burial space, as if they really were one family, &quot;commemorated them with homogeneous memorials and expanded the commemorative audience to the entire local community of coreligionists&quot; thereby redefining the concept of family.

=== Temple conversion within Roman Empire ===

R. P. C. Hanson says the direct conversion of temples into churches began in the mid-fifth century but only in a few isolated incidents. According to modern archaeology, of the thousands of temples that existed across the empire, 120 pagan temples were converted to churches with the majority dated after the fifth century. It is likely this stems from the fact that these buildings remained officially in public use, ownership could only be transferred by the emperor, and temples remained protected by law.

In the fourth century, there were no conversions of temples in the city of Rome itself. It is only with the formation of the Papal State in the eighth century, (when the emperor&#x27;s properties in the West came into the possession of the bishop of Rome), that the conversions of temples in Rome took off in earnest.

According to Dutch historian Feyo L. Schuddeboom, individual temples and temple sites in the city of Rome were converted to churches primarily to preserve their exceptional architecture. They were also used pragmatically because of the importance of their location at the center of town.

=== Temple and icon destruction ===
During his long reign (307–337), Constantine (the first Christian emperor) both destroyed and built a few temples, plundered more, and generally neglected the rest. 

In the 300 years prior to the reign of Constantine, Roman authority had confiscated various church properties. For example, Christian historians recorded that Hadrian (2nd century), when in the military colony of Aelia Capitolina (Jerusalem), had constructed a temple to Aphrodite on the site of the crucifixion of Jesus on Golgotha hill in order to suppress veneration there. Constantine was vigorous in reclaiming such properties whenever these issues were brought to his attention, and he used reclamation to justify the destruction of Aphrodite&#x27;s temple. Using the vocabulary of reclamation, Constantine acquired several more sites of Christian significance in the Holy Land.

In Eusebius&#x27; church history, there is a bold claim of a Constantinian campaign to destroy the temples, however, there are discrepancies in the evidence. Temple destruction is attested to in 43 cases in the written sources, but only four have been confirmed by archaeological evidence. Historians Frank R. Trombley and Ramsay MacMullen explain that discrepancies between literary sources and archaeological evidence exist because it is common for details in the literary sources to be ambiguous and unclear. For example, Malalas claimed Constantine destroyed all the temples, then he said Theodisius destroyed them all, then he said Constantine converted them all to churches.

Additional calculated acts of desecration – removing the hands and feet or mutilating heads and genitals of statues, and &quot;purging sacred precincts with fire&quot; – were acts committed by the common people during the early centuries. While seen as &#x27;proving&#x27; the impotence of the gods, pagan icons were also seen as having been &quot;polluted&quot; by the practice of sacrifice. They were, therefore, in need of &quot;desacralization&quot; or &quot;deconsecration&quot;. Antique historian Peter Brown says that, while it was in some ways studiously vindictive, it was not indiscriminate or extensive. Once temples, icons or statues were detached from &#x27;the contagion&#x27; of sacrifice, they were seen as having returned to innocence. Many statues and temples were then preserved as art. Professor of Byzantine history Helen Saradi-Mendelovici writes that this process implies appreciation of antique art and a conscious desire to find a way to include it in Christian culture.

Aspects of paganism remained part of the civic culture of the Roman Empire till its end. Public spectacles were popular and resisted Christianization: gladiatorial combats (&quot;munera&quot;), animal hunts (&quot;venationes&quot;), theatrical performances (&quot;ludi scaenici&quot;), and chariot races (&quot;ludi circenses&quot;) were accommodated by Roman society even while that society disagreed and debated the definition and scope of christianization. Historian of antiquity Richard Lim writes that it was within this process of debate that &quot;the category of the secular was developed ... [which] helped buffer select cultural practices, including Roman spectacles, from the claims of those who advocated a more thorough christianization of Roman society.&quot; This produced a vigorous public culture shared by polytheists, Jews and Christians alike.

The Roman Empire cannot be considered Christianized before Justinian I in the sixth century, though most scholars agree the Empire was never fully Christianized. Archaeologist and historian Judith Herrin has written in her article on &quot;Book Burning as Purification&quot; that under Justinian, there was considerable destruction. The decree of 528 barred pagans from state office when, decades later, Justinian ordered a &quot;persecution of surviving Hellenes, accompanied by the burning of pagan books, pictures and statues&quot;. This took place at the &quot;Kynêgion&quot;. Herrin says it is difficult to assess the degree to which Christians are responsible for the losses of ancient documents in many cases, but in the mid-sixth century, active persecution in Constantinople destroyed many ancient texts.

=== Other sacred sites ===

The &quot;Venerable Bede&quot; was a Christian monk (672–735) who wrote what sociologist and anthropologist Hutton Webster describes as &quot;the first truly historical work by an Englishman&quot; describing the Christianization of Britain. Pope Gregory I had sent Augustine and several helpers as missionaries to Kent and its powerful King Ethelbert. One of those helpers, Abbott Mellitus, received this letter from Gregory on the proper methods for converting the local people.
I think that the temples of the idols in that nation ought not to be destroyed; but let the idols that are in them be destroyed; let holy water be made and sprinkled in the said temples, and let altars be erected and relics placed. For if those temples are well built, it is requisite that they be converted from the worship of devils to the service of the true God; that the people, seeing that their temples are not destroyed, may remove error from their hearts, and, knowing and adoring the true God, may the more familiarly resort to the places to which they have become accustomed.

When Benedict moved to Monte Cassino about 530, a small temple with a sacred grove and a separate altar to Apollo stood on the hill. The population was still mostly pagan. The land was most likely granted as a gift to Benedict from one of his supporters. This would explain the authoritative way he immediately cut down the groves, removed the altar, and built an oratory before the locals were converted.

Christianization of the Irish landscape was a complex process that varied considerably depending on local conditions. Ancient sites were viewed with veneration, and were excluded or included for Christian use based largely on diverse local feeling about their nature, character, ethos and even location.

In Greece, Byzantine scholar Alison Frantz has won consensus support of her view that, aside from a few rare instances such as the Parthenon which was converted to a church in the sixth century, temple conversions (including the Erechtheion and the Theseion) took place in and after the seventh century, after the displacements caused by the Slavic invasions.

In early Anglo-Saxon England, non-stop religious development meant paganism and Christianity were never completely separate. Archaeologist Lorcan Harney has reported that Anglo-Saxon churches were built by pagan barrows after the 11th century. Richard A. Fletcher suggests that, within the British Isles and other areas of northern Europe that were formerly druidic, there are a dense number of holy wells and holy springs that are now attributed to a saint, often a highly local saint, unknown elsewhere. In earlier times many of these were seen as guarded by supernatural forces such as the melusina, and many such pre-Christian holy wells appear to have survived as baptistries. According to Willibald&#x27;s &quot;Life of Saint Boniface&quot;, about 723, the missioner Boniface cut down the sacred Donar&#x27;s Oak also called the &#x27;Oak of Jupiter&#x27; and used the lumber to build a church dedicated to St. Peter.

By 771, Charlemagne had inherited the long established conflict with the Saxons who regularly specifically targeted churches and monasteries in brutal raids into Frankish territory. In January 772, Charlemagne retaliated with an attack on the Saxon&#x27;s most important holy site, a sacred grove in southern Engria. &quot;It was dominated by the Irminsul (&#x27;Great Pillar&#x27;), which was either a (wooden) pillar or an ancient tree and presumably symbolized Germanic religion&#x27;s &#x27;Universal Tree&#x27;. The Franks cut down the Irminsul, looted the accumulated sacrificial treasures (which the King distributed among his men), and torched the entire grove... Charlemagne ordered a Frankish fortress to be erected at the Eresburg&quot;.

Early historians of Scandinavian Christianization wrote of dramatic events associated with Christianization in the manner of political propagandists according to who references the 1987 survey by the historian of medieval Scandinavia, Birgit Sawyer. Sørensen focuses on the changes of names, both personal and place names, showing that cultic elements were not banned and are still in evidence today. Large numbers of pre-Christian names survive into the present day, and Sørensen says this demonstrates the process of Christianization in Denmark was peaceful and gradual and did not include the complete eradication of the old cultic associations. However, there are local differences.

Outside of Scandinavia, old names did not fare as well. The highest point in Paris was known in the pre-Christian period as the Hill of Mercury, Mons Mercuri. Evidence of the worship of this Roman god here was removed in the early Christian period and in the ninth century a sanctuary was built here, dedicated to the 10000 martyrs. The hill was then called Mons Martyrum, the name by which it is still known (Mont Martres) (Longnon 1923, 377; Vincent 1937, 307).

San Marino in northern Italy, the shrine of Saint Marino, replaced a pre-Christian cultic name for the place: Monte Titano, where the Titans had been worshipped (Pfeiffer 1980, 79).

[The] Monte Giove &quot;Hill of Jupiter&quot; came to be known as San Bernardo, in honour of St Bernhard (Pfeiffer 1980, 79).

In Germany an old Wodanesberg &quot;Hill of Ódin&quot; was renamed Godesberg (Bach 1956, 553). Ä controversial but not unreasonable suggestion is that the locality named by Ädam of Bremen as Fosetisland &quot;land of the god Foseti&quot; is to be identified with Helgoland &quot;the holy land&quot;, the island off the coast of northern Friesland which, according to Ädam, was treated with superstitious respect by all sailors, particularly pirates (Laur 1960, 360 with references).

The practice of replacing pagan beliefs and motifs with Christian, and purposefully not recording the pagan history (such as the names of pagan gods, or details of pagan religious practices), has been compared to the practice of &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;.

== Nations ==
=== Roman Empire to Early Middle Ages (1 to 800) ===

==== Christianization without coercion ====

There is agreement among twenty-first century scholars that Christianization of the Roman Empire in its first three centuries did not happen by imposition. Christianization emerged naturally as the cumulative result of multiple individual decisions and behaviors. 
While enduring three centuries of on-again, off-again persecution, from differing levels of government ranging from local to imperial, Christianity had remained &#x27;self-organized&#x27; and without central authority. In this manner, it reached an important threshold of success between 150 and 250, when it moved from less than 50,000 adherents to over a million, and became self-sustaining and able to generate further growth. There was a significant rise in the absolute number of Christians in the third century.

==== Constantine and the goal of Christianization====

The Christianization of the Roman Empire is frequently divided by scholars into the two phases of before and after the conversion of Constantine in 312. 
Constantine did not support the suppression of paganism by force. He never engaged in a purge, and there were no pagan martyrs during his reign. Pagans remained in important positions at his court. Constantine ruled for 31 years and despite personal animosity toward paganism, he never outlawed paganism. Making the adoption of Christianity beneficial was Constantine&#x27;s primary approach to religion, and imperial favor was important to successful Christianization over the next century. Yet, Constantine did not institute many christianizing changes, and those measures he did enact did little to Christianize civic culture.

According to historian Michelle Renee Salzman, there is no evidence to indicate that conversion of pagans through force was an accepted method of Christianization at any point in Late Antiquity. Evidence indicates all uses of imperial force concerning religion were aimed at heretics (who were already Christian) such as the Donatists and the Manichaeans and not at non-believers such as Jews or pagans.

However, Constantine must have written the laws that threatened and menaced pagans who continued to practice sacrifice. The element of pagan culture most abhorrent to Christians was sacrifice, and altars used for it were routinely smashed. Christians were deeply offended by the blood of slaughtered victims as they were reminded of their own past sufferings associated with such altars. Richard Lim writes that &quot;Putting an end to blood sacrifice ... thus became the singular goal of Christianization (Barnes 1984; Bradbury 1994, 1995)&quot;.

There is no evidence that any of the horrific punishments included in the laws against sacrifice were ever enacted. There is no record of anyone being executed for violating religious laws before Tiberius II Constantine at the end of the sixth century (574–582). Still, Bradbury notes that the complete disappearance of public sacrifice by the mid-fourth century &quot;in many towns and cities must be attributed to the atmosphere created by imperial and episcopal hostility&quot;.

==== Christianization with coercion under Justinian I ====
The religious policy of the Eastern emperor Justinian I (527 to 565) reflected his conviction that a unified Empire presupposed unity of faith. Justinian&#x27;s efforts at requiring and enforcing this have led Anthony Kaldellis to write that Justinian is often seen as a tyrant and despot. Unlike Constantine, Justinian did purge the bureaucracy of those who disagreed with him. He sought to centralize imperial government, became increasingly autocratic, and according to the historian Giovanni Mansi, &quot;nothing could be done&quot;, not even in the Church, that was contrary to the emperor&#x27;s will and command. In Kaldellis&#x27; estimation, &quot;Few emperors had started so many wars or tried to enforce cultural and religious uniformity with such zeal&quot;.
=== Germanic tribes ===

Christianization spread through the Roman Empire and neighboring empires in the next few centuries, converting most of the Germanic barbarian peoples who would form the ethnic communities that would become the future nations of Europe. The earliest references to the Christianization of these tribes are in the writings of Irenaeus (130–202), Origen (185–253), and Tertullian (&quot;Adv. Jud. VII&quot;) (155–220).

Tacitus describes the nature of German religion, and their understanding of the function of a king, as facilitating Christianization. Missionaries aimed at converting Germanic nobility first. Ties of fealty between German kings and their followers often produced mass conversions of entire tribes following their king. Afterwards, their societies began a gradual process of Christianization that took centuries, with some traces of earlier beliefs remaining.

In all cases, Christianization meant &quot;the Germanic conquerors lost their native languages. ...[or] the syntax, the conceptual framework underlying the lexicon, and most of the literary forms, were thoroughly latinized&quot;.

Saint Boniface led the effort in the mid-eighth century to organize churches in the region that would become modern Germany. As ecclesiastical organization increased, so did the political unity of the Germanic Christians. By the year 962, when Pope John XII anoints King Otto I as Holy Roman Emperor, &quot;Germany and Christendom had become one&quot;. This union lasted until dissolved by Napoleon in 1806.

==== Franks ====
The Franks first appear in the historical record in the 3rd century as a confederation of Germanic tribes living on the east bank of the lower Rhine River. Clovis I was the first king of the Franks to unite all of the Frankish tribes under one ruler. The most likely date of his conversion to Catholicism is Christmas Day, 508, following the Battle of Tolbiac. He was baptized in Rheims. The Frankish Kingdom became Christian over the next two centuries.

Saxons went back and forth between rebellion and submission to the Franks for decades. Charlemagne (r. 768–814) placed missionaries and courts across Saxony in hopes of pacifying the region, but Saxons rebelled again in 782 with disastrous losses for the Franks. In response, the Frankish King &quot;enacted a variety of draconian measures&quot; beginning with the massacre at Verden in 782 when he ordered the decapitation of 4500 Saxon prisoners offering them baptism as an alternative to death. These events were followed by the severe legislation of the &quot;Capitulatio de partibus Saxoniae&quot; in 785 which prescribes death to those that are disloyal to the king, harm Christian churches or its ministers, or practice pagan burial rites. His harsh methods of Christianization raised objections from his friends Alcuin and Paulinus of Aquileia. Charlemagne abolished the death penalty for paganism in 797.

=== Ireland ===
Pope Celestine I (422–430) sent Palladius to be the first bishop to the Irish in 431, and in 432, St Patrick began his mission there. Scholars cite many questions (and scarce sources) concerning the next two hundred years. Relying largely on recent archaeological developments, Lorcan Harney has reported to the Royal Academy that the missionaries and traders who came to Ireland in the fifth to sixth centuries were not backed by any military force. Patrick and Palladius and other British and Gaulish missionaries aimed first at converting royal households. Patrick indicates in his &quot;Confessio&quot; that safety depended upon it. Communities often followed their king en masse.

=== Great Britain ===

Christianity likely reached Britain around 200 with archaeology indicating that it continued as a minority faith into fourth century. Thereafter, Irish missionaries led by Saint Columba, based in Iona (from 563), converted many Picts.

The Christianisation of Anglo-Saxon England began in the late 6th century when the Gregorian mission was launched, leading to the conversion of Æthelberht of Kent around 600. After this, further kings converted such as Eadwine of Deira around 628 and Sigeberht of Essex around 653. Although the traditional religion often regained royal support after the conversion of the first king, Christianity did nonetheless become dominant in England, with the last heathen Anglo-Saxon king Arwald of Wihtwara being killed in battle in 686 and his two sons forcefully baptised and excecuted. Closely related Nordic forms of paganism were introduced by Scandinavian settlers during the 9th and 10th centuries. Christianity was likely adopted within several generations, with the last potentially heathen king to rule in England being Erik Bloodaxe, who died in 954. Suppression of paganism in England is first recorded as having taken place in the mid 7th century during the reign of Eorcenberht of Kent and continued into the 11th century, with law codes prescribing punishments such as fines, fasting and excecution. Not all Germanic cultural elements were suppressed however, with many blending with Christian ones and some continuing in folklore into the modern period.

=== Italy ===
Classicist J.H.D. Scourfield writes that Christianization in Italy in Late Antiquity is &quot;most aptly described in terms of negotiation, accommodation, adaptation, [and] transformation&quot;. Christianization in Italy allowed for religious competition and cooperation, included syncretism both to and from pagans and Christians, and allowed secularism.

In 529, Benedict of Nursia established his first monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy. He wrote the Rule of Saint Benedict based on &quot;pray and work&quot;. This &quot;Rule&quot; provided the foundation of the majority of the thousands of monasteries that spread across the continent of what is now modern day Europe, thereby becoming a major factor in the Christianization of Europe.

=== Greece ===
Christianization was slower in Greece than in most other parts of the Roman empire. There are multiple theories of why, but there is no consensus. What is agreed upon is that, for a variety of reasons, Christianization did not take hold in Greece until the fourth and fifth centuries. Christians and pagans maintained a self imposed segregation throughout the period. Historian and archaeologist Timothy E. Gregory has written in &quot;The Survival of Paganism in Christian Greece: A Critical Essay&quot; that J. M. Speiser successfully argued this was the situation throughout the country, and &quot;rarely was there any significant contact, hostile or otherwise&quot; between Christians and pagans in Greece.

Gregory adds his view that &quot;it is admirably clear that organized paganism survived well into the sixth century throughout the empire and in parts of Greece (at least in the Mani) until the ninth century or later&quot;. Pagan ideas and forms persisted most in practices related to healing, death, and the family.

=== Albania (Balkan) ===
Proto-Albanian speakers were Christianized under the Latin sphere of influence, specifically in the 4th century AD, as shown by the basic Christian terms in Albanian, which are of Latin origin and entered Proto-Albanian before the Gheg–Tosk dialectal diversification.

At the time of the South Slavic incursion and the threat of ethnic turbulence in the Albanian-inhabited regions, the Christianization of the Albanians had already been completed and it had apparently developed for Albanians as a further identity-forming feature alongside the ethnic-linguistic unity. Church administration, which was controlled by a thick network of Roman bishoprics, collapsed with the arrival of the Slavs. Between the early 7th century and the late 9th century the interior areas of the Balkans were deprived of church administration, and Christianity might have survived only as a popular tradition on a reduced degree. Some Albanians living in the mountains, who were only partially affected by Romanization, probably sank back into the Classic Paganism.

The reorganization of the Church as a cult institution in the region took a considerable amount of time. The Balkans were brought back into the Christian orbit only after the recovery of the Byzantine Empire and through the activity of Byzantine missionaries. The earliest church vocabulary of Middle Greek origin in Albanian dates to the 8th–9th centuries, at the time of the Byzantine Iconoclasm, which was started by the Byzantine Emperor Leo III the Isaurian. In 726 Leo III established &quot;de jure&quot; the jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople over the Balkans, as the Church and the State established an institution. The Eastern Church expanded its influence in the area along with the social and political developments. Between the 7th and 12th centuries a powerful network of cult institutions were revived completely covering the ecclesiastical administration of the entire present-day Albanian-speaking compact area. In particular an important role was played by the Theme of Dyrrhachium and the Archdiocese of Ohrid. Survived through the centuries, the Christian belief among Albanians became an important cultural element in their ethnic identity. Indeed, the lack of Old Church Slavonic terms in Albanian Christian terminology shows that the missionary activities during the Christianization of the Slavs did not involve Albanian-speakers. In a text compiled around the beginning of the 11th century in the Old Bulgarian language, the Albanians are mentioned for the first time with their old ethnonym &quot;Arbanasi&quot; as half-believers, a term which for Eastern Orthodox Christian Bulgarians meant Catholic Christian. The Great Schism of 1054 involved Albania separating the region between Catholic Christianity in the north and Orthodox Christianity in the south.

Regardless of the Christianization, ancient paganism persisted among Albanians, and especially within the inaccessible and deep interior – where Albanian folklore evolved over the centuries in a relatively isolated tribal culture and society – it has continued to persist, or at most it was partially transformed by the Christian, and later Muslim and Marxist beliefs, that were either to be introduced by choice or imposed by force. Albanian traditions have been orally transmitted through memory systems that have survived intact into modern times. The Albanian traditional customary law (Kanun) has held a sacred – although secular – longstanding, unwavering and unchallenged authority with a cross-religious effectiveness over the Albanians, which is attributed to an earlier pagan code common to all the Albanian tribes. Historically, the Christian clergy has vigorously fought, but without success, the pagan rituals practiced by Albanians for traditional feasts and particular events, especially the fire rituals (Zjarri).

=== Caucasian Albania ===
Most scholars agree that Christianity was officially adopted in Caucasian Albania in AD 313 or AD 315 when Gregory the Illuminator baptized the Albanian king and ordained the first bishop Tovmas, the founder of the Albanian church. It is highly probable that Christianity covered the whole of antique Caucasian Albania by the late fourth century. In his article &quot;About the Dating of the Christianization of Caucasian Albania&quot; historian of the Christian East, Aleksan H. Hakobyan, has written:

The king of the country then was the founder of the Arsacid dynasty of Albania Vachagan I the Brave (but not his grandson Urnayr), and the king of Armenia was Tiridat III the Great, also Arsacid. As M. L. Chaumont established in 1969, the latter, with the help of Gregory the Illuminator, adopted the Christian faith at the state level in June 311, two months after the publication of the Edict of Sardica &quot;On Tolerance&quot; by Emperor Galerius (293–311). In 313, after the appearance of the Edict of Milan, Tiridat attracted the younger allies of Armenia Iberia-Kartli, Albania-Aluank&#x27; and Lazika-Egerk&#x27; (Colchis) to the process of Christianization.

In the first half of 315, Gregory the Illuminator baptized the Albanian king (who had arrived in Armenia) and ordained the first bishop Tovmas (the founder of the Albanian church, with the center in the capital Kapalak) for his country: he was from the city of Satala in Lesser Armenia. Probably, at the same stage, Christianization covered the whole of antique Albania, i.e. territory north of the Kura River, to the Caspian Sea and the Derbend Pass.

=== Armenia, Georgia, Ethiopia and Eritrea ===
In 301, Armenia became the first kingdom in history to adopt Christianity as an official state religion. The transformations taking place in these centuries of the Roman Empire had been slower to catch on in Caucasia. Indigenous writing did not begin until the fifth century, there was an absence of large cities, and many institutions such as monasticism did not exist in Caucasia until the seventh century. Scholarly consensus places the Christianization of the Armenian and Georgian elites in the first half of the fourth century, although Armenian tradition says Christianization began in the first century through the Apostles Thaddeus and Bartholomew. This is said to have eventually led to the conversion of the Arsacid family, (the royal house of Armenia), through St. Gregory the Illuminator in the early fourth century.

Christianization took many generations and was not a uniform process. Byzantine historian Robert Thomson writes that it was not the officially established hierarchy of the church that spread Christianity in Armenia; &quot;It was the unorganized activity of wandering holy men that brought about the Christianization of the populace at large&quot;. The most significant stage in this process was the development of a script for the native tongue.

Scholars do not agree on the exact date of Christianization of Georgia, but most assert the early 4th century when Mirian III of the Kingdom of Iberia (known locally as Kartli) adopted Christianity. According to medieval Georgian Chronicles, Christianization began with Andrew the Apostle and culminated in the evangelization of Iberia through the efforts of a captive woman known in Iberian tradition as Saint Nino in the fourth century. Fifth, 8th, and 12th century accounts of the conversion of Georgia reveal how pre-Christian practices were taken up and reinterpreted by Christian narrators.

In 325, the Kingdom of Aksum (Modern Ethiopia and Eritrea) became the second country to declare Christianity as its official state religion.

=== A seismic moment on the Iberian Peninsula ===

Hispania had become part of the Roman Republic in the third century BC. Christian communities can be found dating to the third century, and bishoprics had been created in León, Mérida and Zaragoza by that same period. In AD 300 an ecclesiastical council held in Elvira was attended by 20 bishops. With the end of persecution in 312, churches, baptistries, hospitals and episcopal palaces were erected in most major towns, and many landed aristocracy embraced the faith and converted sections of their villas into chapels.

In 416, the Germanic Visigoths crossed into Hispania as Roman allies. They converted to Arian Christianity shortly before 429. The Visigothic King Sisebut came to the throne in 612 when the Roman emperor Heraclius surrendered his Spanish holdings. Sisebut banished all Jews who would not submit to baptism. Roman historian Edmund Spenser Bouchier says 90,000 Hebrews were baptized while others fled to France or North Africa. This contradicted the traditional position of the Catholic Church on the Jews, and scholars refer to this shift as a &quot;seismic moment&quot; in Christianization.

=== Europe and Asia of the High and Late Middle Ages (800 to 1500) ===
In Central and Eastern Europe of the 8th and 9th centuries, Christianization was an integral part of the political centralization of the new nations being formed. In Eastern Europe, the combination of Christianization and political centralization created what Peter Brown describes as, &quot;specific micro-Christendoms&quot;. Bulgaria, Bohemia (which became Czechoslovakia), the Serbs and the Croats, along with Hungary, and Poland, voluntarily joined the Western, Latin church, sometimes pressuring their people to follow. Full Christianization of the populace often took centuries to accomplish. Conversion began with local elites who wanted to convert because they gained prestige and power through matrimonial alliances and participation in imperial rituals. Christianization then spread from the center to the edges of society.

Historian Ivo Štefan has written, &quot;Although Christian authors often depicted the conversion of rulers as the triumph of the new faith, the reality was much more complex. Christianization of everyday life took centuries, with many non-Christian elements surviving in rural communities until the beginning of the modern era&quot;.

==== Language and literature ====
In the Christianization process of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia territories, the two Byzantine missionary brothers Saints Constantine-Cyril and Methodius played the key roles beginning in 863. They spent approximately 40 months in Great Moravia continuously translating texts and teaching students. Cyril developed the first Slavic alphabet and translated the gospel into the Old Church Slavonic language. Old Church Slavonic became the first literary language of the Slavs and, eventually, the educational foundation for all Slavic nations. In 869 Methodius was consecrated as (arch)bishop of Pannonia and the Great Moravia regions.

=== Bulgaria ===

Official Christianization began in 864/5 under Khan Boris I (852– 889). Boris I determined that imposing Christianity was the answer to internal peace and external security. The decision was partly military, partly domestic, and partly to diminish the power of the Proto-Bulgarian nobility. A number of nobles reacted violently; 52 were executed. After prolonged negotiations with both Rome and Constantinople, an autocephalous Bulgarian Orthodox Church was formed that used the newly created Cyrillic script to make the Bulgarian language the language of the Church. After a series of victories in wars against the Byzantines led by Symeon (893 to 927), the Byzantines recognized the Bulgarian Patriarchate.

=== Serbia ===

The full conversion of the Slavs dates to the time of Eastern Orthodox missionaries Saints Cyril and Methodius during the reign of the Byzantine emperor Basil I (r. 867–886). The first diocese of Serbia, the Diocese of Ras, is mentioned in the ninth century. Serbs were baptized sometime before Basil I, who was asked by the Ragusians for help, sent imperial admiral Nikita Orifas to Knez Mutimir to aid in the war against the Saracens in 869. Serbia can certainly be seen as a Christian nation by 870.

=== Croatia ===
According to Constantine VII, Christianization of Croats began in the 7th century. The conversion of Croatia is said to have been completed by the time of Duke Trpimir&#x27;s death in 864. In 879, under duke Branimir, Croatia received papal recognition as a state from Pope John VIII.

=== Bohemia/Czech lands ===

What was Bohemia forms much of the Czech Republic, comprising the central and western portions of the country.

Significant missionary activity only took place after Charlemagne defeated the Avar Khaganate several times at the end of the 8th century and beginning of the ninth centuries. The first Christian church of the Western and Eastern Slavs (known to written sources) was built in 828 by Pribina (c. 800–861) ruler and Prince of the Principality of Nitra. In 880, Pope John VIII issued the bull &quot;Industriae Tuae&quot;, by which he set up the independent ecclesiastical province with Archbishop Methodius as its head. Relics withstood the fall of Great Moravia.

=== Poland ===


According to historians Franciszek Longchamps de Bérier and Rafael Domingo: &quot;A pre-Christian Poland never existed. Poland entered history suddenly when some western lands inhabited by the Slavs embraced Christianity&quot;. The dynastic interests of the Piasts produced the establishment of both church and state in Great Poland (Greater Poland, also known as &quot;Wielkopolska&quot; in Polish, is a historical region of west-central Poland. Its chief and largest city is Poznań.). The &quot;Baptism of Poland&quot; () in 966, refers to the baptism of Mieszko I, the first ruler. Mieszko&#x27;s baptism was followed by the building of churches and the establishment of an ecclesiastical hierarchy. Mieszko saw baptism as a way of strengthening his hold on power, with the active support he could expect from the bishops, as well as a unifying force for the Polish people.

=== Hungary ===
Around 952, the tribal chief Gyula II of Transylvania, visited Constantinople and was baptized, bringing home with him Hierotheus who was designated bishop of Turkia (Hungary). The conversion of Gyula at Constantinople and the missionary work of Bishop Hierotheus are depicted as leading directly to the court of St. Stephen, the first Hungarian king, a Christian in a still mostly pagan country.

Stephen suppressed rebellion, organized both the Hungarian State (with strong royal authority), and the church, by inviting missionaries, and suppressing paganism by making laws such as requiring people to attend church every Sunday. Soon the Hungarian Kingdom had two archbishops and 8 bishops, and a defined state structure with province governors that answered to the King. Saint Stephen was the first Hungarian monarch elevated to sainthood for his Christian characteristics and not because he suffered a martyr&#x27;s death. Hungarian Christianity and the kingdom&#x27;s ecclesiastical and temporal administrations consolidated towards the end of the 11th century.

=== Scandinavia (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland) ===
Christianization of Scandinavia is divided into two stages by Professor of medieval archaeology Alexandra Sanmark. Stage 1 involves missionaries who arrived in pagan territory in the 800s, on their own, without secular support. Historian Florence Harmer writes &quot;Between A.D. 960 and 1008 three Scandinavian kings were converted to Christianity&quot;. The Danish King Harald Gormsen (Bluetooth) was baptized c. 960. The conversion of Norway was begun by Hákon Aðalsteinsfostri between 935 and 961, but the wide-scale conversion of this kingdom was undertaken by King Olaf Tryggvason in c. 995. In Sweden, King Olof Erikson Skötkonung accepted Christianity around 1000.

According to Peter Brown, Scandinavians adopted Christianity of their own accord c.1000. Anders Winroth explains that Iceland became the model for the institutional conversion of the rest of Scandinavia after AD 1000. Winroth demonstrates that Scandinavians were not passive recipients of the new religion, but converted to Christianity because it was in their political, economic, and cultural interests to do so.

Stage 2 began when a secular ruler took charge of Christianization in their territory, and ended when a defined and organized ecclesiastical network was established. By 1350, Scandinavia was an integral part of Western Christendom.

=== Romania ===
In the last two decades of the 9th century, missionaries Clement and Naum, (who were disciples of the brothers Cyril and Methodius), had arrived in the region spreading the Cyrillic alphabet. By the 10th century when the Bulgarian Tsars extended their territory to include Transylvania, they were able to impose the Bulgarian church model and its Slavic language without opposition. Nearly all Romanian words concerning Christian faith have Latin roots (from the early centuries of Roman occupation), while words regarding the organization of the church are Slavonic.

Romanian historian Ioan-Aurel Pop writes &quot;Christian fervor and the massive conversion to Christianity among the Slavs may have led to the canonic conversion of the last heathen, or ecclesiastically unorganized, Romanian islands&quot;. For Romanians, the church model was &quot;overwhelming, omnipresent, putting pressure on the Romanians and often accompanied by a political element&quot;. This ecclesiastical and political tradition continued until the 19th century.

=== Northern Crusades ===
From before the days of Charlemagne (747–814), the fierce pagan tribes east of the Baltic Sea lived on the physical frontiers of Christendom in what has today become Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and the Kaliningrad oblast (Prussia). They survived largely by raiding – stealing crucial resources, killing, and enslaving captives – from the countries that surrounded them including Denmark, Prussia, Germany and Poland.

One result of the northern crusades, according to historian Aiden Lilienfeld, was that: &quot;[ . . . ] The conquering forces of the Northern Crusades brought more territory under German control than nearly any other concerted expansion in the history of the Holy Roman Empire&quot;—emphasizing that duty to the faith could often go hand-in-hand, from the perspective of prospective crusaders, with political and material benefit.

Combining their personal priorities with a need to permanently stop the raiding, they requested permission to subdue the Baltic instead. In 1147, Eugenius&#x27; &quot;Divini dispensatione,&quot; gave the eastern nobles full crusade indulgences to do so. The Northern, (or Baltic), Crusades followed, taking place, off and on, with and without papal support, from 1147 to 1316.

Acquisition of territory and wealth was a major aim—perhaps &quot;the&quot; major aim—in undertaking military action, on the part of the Christian rulers west of the Oder, and clerics such as Helmond of Bosau complained that the nobles&#x27; demands for tribute hindered the process of conversion; on the other hand, the Christianization of the locals—and the putative rewards in the hereafter to ensue from its success—was a powerful motivator as well. In some cases, voluntary conversion of the local aristocracy—usually followed by the populace, under this influence—was recognized, and stayed the hand of war; in others, naked ambition and greed for material wealth resulted in military actions against ostensibly already-converted peoples. In most cases, conversion was ultimately the result of conquest.

According to Fonnesberg-Schmidt: &quot;While the theologians maintained that conversion should be voluntary, there was a widespread pragmatic acceptance of conversion obtained through political pressure or military coercion&quot;. There were often severe consequences for populations that chose to resist, though in some instances local rulers were able to successfully plead a case for withholding attempts at the forcible Christianization of the populace—both ruler and crusaders cognizant of the risk of armed rebellion (and hence disruption of profitable trade or tribute), were such attempts to proceed.

=== Lithuania ===

The last of the Baltic crusades was the conflict between the mostly German Teutonic Order and Lithuania in the far northeastern reaches of Europe. Lithuania is sometimes described as &quot;the last pagan nation in medieval Europe&quot;.

The Teutonic Order was a mostly German crusading organization from the Christian Holy Land founded by members of the Knights Hospitaller. Medieval historian Aiden Lilienfeld says &quot;In 1226, however, the Duke of Mazovia ... granted the Order territory in eastern Prussia in exchange for help in subjugating pagan Baltic peoples&quot;. Over the course of the next 200 years, the Order expanded its territory to cover much of the eastern Baltic coast.

In 1384, Jadwiga, the ten year old daughter of Louis the Great, King of Hungary and Poland and his wife Elizabeth of Bosnia, was crowned &quot;king&quot; of Poland. One year later, a marriage was arranged between her and the Grand Duke Jogaila of Lithuania. Duke Jogaila was baptized, married, and crowned king in 1386, thus beginning the 400 year shared history of Poland and Lithuania. This would seem to obviate the need for religious crusade, yet activity against local populations, particularly the Samogitian peoples of the eastern Baltic, continued in a frequently brutal manner.

The Teutonic Order eventually fell to Poland-Lithuania in 1525. Lilienfeld says &quot;After this, the Order&#x27;s territory was divided between Poland-Lithuania and the Hohenzollern dynasty of Brandenburg, putting an end to the monastic state and the formal Northern Crusade. All of the Order&#x27;s most powerful cities–Danzig (Gdansk), Elbing (Elblag), Marienburg (Malbork), and Braunsberg (Braniewo)–now fall within Poland in the 21st century, except for Koenigsburg (Kaliningrad) in Russia.&quot;

=== Kievan Rus&#x27; ===
Around 978, Vladimir (978–1015), the son of Sviatoslav, seized power in Kiev. Slavic historian Ivo Štefan writes that, Vladimir examined monotheism for himself, and &quot;Around that same time, Vladimir conquered Cherson in the Crimea, where, according to the Tale of Bygone Years, he was baptized&quot;. After returning to Kiev, the same text describes Vladimir as unleashing &quot;a systematic destruction of pagan idols and the construction of Christian churches in their place&quot;.

Bohemia, Poland, and Hungary had become part of western Latin Christianity, while the Rus&#x27; adopted Christianity from Byzantium, leading them down a different path. A specific form of Rus&#x27; Christianity formed quickly.

The Rus&#x27; dukes maintained exclusive control of the church which was financially dependent upon them. The prince appointed the clergy to positions in government service; satisfied their material needs; determined who would fill the higher ecclesiastical positions; and directed the synods of bishops in the Kievan metropolitanate. This new Christian religious structure was imposed upon the socio-political and economic fabric of the land by the authority of the state&#x27;s rulers. According to Andrzej Poppe, Slavic historian, it is fully justifiable to call the Church of Rus&#x27; a state church. The Church strengthened the authority of the Prince, and helped to justifiy the expansion of Kievan empire into new territories through missionary activity.

Christian clergy translated religious texts into local vernacular language which introduced literacy to all members of the princely dynasty, including women and the general populace. Monasteries of the twelfth century became key spiritual, intellectual, art, and craft centers. Under Vladimir&#x27;s son Yaroslav I the Wise (1016–1018, 1019–1054), a building and cultural boom took place. The Church of Rus&#x27; gradually developed into an independent political force in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

=== Finland ===
According to the archaeological finds, Christianity gained a foothold in Finland during the 11th century. According to the very few written documents that have survived, the church in Finland was still in its early development in the 12th century. Later medieval legends from late 13th century describe Swedish attempts to conquer and Christianize Finland sometime in the mid-1150s. Danish troops raided the Finnish coastline several times between 1191 and 1202. The Finnish tribes were able to wage war and engage in trade, but over time, were increasingly drawn into Latin Christendom. The Catholic church was strengthened with growing Swedish influence in the 12th century and the Finnish &quot;crusade&quot; of Birger Jarl in the 13th century.

In the early 13th century, Bishop Thomas became the first known bishop of Finland. There were several secular powers who aimed to bring the Finnish tribes under their rule. These were Sweden, Denmark, the Republic of Novgorod in northwestern Russia, and probably the German crusading orders as well. Finns had their own chiefs, but most probably no central authority. At the time there can be seen three cultural areas or tribes in Finland: Finns, Tavastians and Karelians. Russian chronicles indicate there were several conflicts between Novgorod and the Finnic tribes from the 11th or 12th century to the early 13th century. The influence of Russian Orthodoxy was extended to the area around Lake Onega and Lake Ladoga and the &quot;Häme&quot; (Tavastians) there were converted.

=== Iberian Reconquista ===
Between 711 and 718, the Iberian Peninsula had been conquered by Muslims in the Umayyad conquest. The centuries long military struggle to reclaim the peninsula from Muslim rule, called the Reconquista, took place until the Christian Kingdoms, that would later become Spain and Portugal, reconquered the Moorish Al-Ándalus in 1492. (The Battle of Covadonga in 722 is seen as the beginning of Reconquista and the annexation of Grenada in 1492 is its end).

Isabel and Ferdinand married in October 1469 thereby uniting Spain with themselves as its first royalty. In 1478, they established the Spanish Inquisition, telling the Pope it was needed to find heretics – specifically Jews pretending to be Christian so they could spy for Moslems who wanted their territory back. In actuality, it served state interests and consolidated power in the monarchy. The Spanish inquisition was originally authorized by the Pope, yet the initial inquisitors proved so severe that the Pope almost immediately opposed it and attempted to shut it down without success. Ferdinand is said to have pressured the Pope, and in October 1483, a papal bull conceded control of the inquisition to the Spanish crown. According to Spanish historian José Casanova, the Spanish inquisition became the first truly national, unified and centralized state institution.

== Early colonialism (1500s–1700s) ==
Following the geographic discoveries of the 1400s and 1500s, increasing population and inflation led the emerging nation-states of Portugal, Spain, and France, the Dutch Republic, and England to explore, conquer, colonize and exploit the newly discovered territories. While colonialism was primarily economic and political, it opened the door for Christian missionaries who accompanied the early explorers, or soon followed them, thereby connecting Christianization and colonialism.

History also connects Christianization with opposition to colonialism. Historian Lamin Sanneh writes that there is an equal amount of evidence of both missionary support and missionary opposition to colonialism through &quot;protest and resistance both in the church and in politics&quot;. In Sanneh&#x27;s view, missions were &quot;colonialism&#x27;s Achilles&#x27; heel, not its shield&quot;. He goes on to explain this is because, &quot;Despite their role as allies of the empire, missions also developed the vernacular that inspired sentiments of national identity and thus undercut Christianity&#x27;s identification with colonial rule&quot;. According to historical theologian Justo Gonzales, colonialism and missions each sometimes aided and sometimes impeded the other.

Different state actors created colonies that varied widely. Some colonies had institutions that allowed native populations to reap some benefits. Others became extractive colonies with predatory rule that produced an autocracy with a dismal record.

=== Disease ===
A catastrophe was wrought upon the Amerindians by contact with Europeans. Old World diseases like smallpox, measles, malaria and many others spread through Indian populations. Historian Barry Strauss and the coauthors of &quot;Western Civilization The Continuing Experiment&quot;, have stated that, &quot;In most of the New World, 90 percent or more of the native population was destroyed by wave after wave of previously unknown afflictions. Explorers and colonists did not enter an empty land but rather an emptied one&quot;.

=== Spanish and Portuguese India, Mexico and the Americas ===

Portugal practiced extractive colonialism, and was the first to get involved in the pre-existing slave trade. Historian Kenneth Morgan writes that, &quot;the Portuguese and the Spanish dominated the early phase of transatlantic slavery&quot;.
Under Spanish and Portuguese rule, creating a Christian Commonwealth was the goal of missions. This included a significant role, from the beginning of colonial rule, played by Catholic missionaries.

Early attempts at Christianization in India were not very successful, and those who had been converted were not well instructed. In the church&#x27;s view, this led them into &quot;errors and misunderstandings&quot; that were often defined as heresy. In December 1560, the state controlled Portuguese Inquisition arrived in Goa, India. This was largely the result of the crown&#x27;s fear that converted Jews were becoming dominant in Goa and might ally with Ottoman Jews to threaten Portuguese control of the spice trade. After 1561, the Inquisition had a practical monopoly over heresy, and its &quot;policy of terror ... was reflected in the approximately 15,000 trials which took place between 1561 and 1812, involving more than 200 death sentences&quot;.

Spanish missionaries are generally credited with championing efforts to initiate protective laws for the Indians and for working against their enslavement. This led to debate on the nature of human rights. In 16th-century Spain, the issue resulted in a crisis of conscience and the birth of modern international law. Jesuit opposition to the enslavement of native Amerindians inadvertently contributed to the proliferation of black African slaves in their place.

In words of outrage, Junipero Serra wrote of the depredations of the soldiers against Indian women in California in 1770. Following through on missionary complaints, Viceroy Bucareli drew up the first regulatory code of California, the &quot;Echeveste Regulations.&quot; Missionary opposition and military prosecution failed to protect the Amerindian women. On the one hand, California missionaries sought to protect the Amerindians from exploitation by the conquistadores, the ordinary soldiers and the colonists. On the other hand, Jesuits, Franciscans and other orders relied on corporal punishment and an institutionalized racialism for training the &quot;untamed savages&quot;.

=== French Canada, North America, West Africa, Indochina and the West Indies ===
In the seventeenth century, the French used assimilation as a means of establishing colonies controlled by the nation-state rather than private companies. Referred to as the &quot;Civilizing Mission&quot;, the goal was a political and religious community representative of an ideal society as articulated through the progressive theory of history. This common theory of the time asserts that history shows the normal progression of society is toward constant betterment; that humans could therefore eventually be perfected; that primitive nations could be forced to become modern states wherein that would happen. The French advocated multiple aspects of European culture such as &quot;civility, social organization, law, economic development, civil status&quot;, as well as European dress, bodily description, religion, and more, excluding and replacing local culture as the means to this end. Dutch historian Henk Wesseling describes this as &quot;... turning the coloured peoples – by means of education – into coloured Frenchmen&quot;.

=== Dutch Indonesia, South Africa, Curaçao, New Guinea ===
The Dutch Reformed church was not a dominant influence in the Dutch colonies. However, the Dutch East Indies Trading Company was a dominant force; it became a monopoly with government support as a merchant company, a military power, a government, and even an agricultural producer. Dutch imperialism began with a military takeover of the Bandanese island of Pulau Ay in 1615, which was followed by more military action, forced relocation (and forced mobilization), slavery, the slave trade which defined people as property like crops, and other forms of coerced labor.

=== British North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia and Africa ===
Colonies in the Americas experienced a distinct type of colonialism called settler colonialism that replaces indigenous populations with a settler society. Settler colonial states include Canada, the United States, Australia, and South Africa.

Great Britain&#x27;s colonial expansion was for the most part driven by commercial ambitions and competition with France. Investors saw converting the natives as a secondary concern. Historian of British history and culture, Laura Stevens, writes that British missions were &quot;more talk than walk&quot;. From the beginning, the British talked (and wrote) a great deal about converting native populations, but actual efforts were few and feeble. Historian Jacob Schacter says these missions were universally Protestant, were based on belief in the traditional duty to &quot;teach all nations&quot;, the sense of &quot;obligation to extend the benefits of Christianity to heathen lands&quot; (just as Europe itself had been &quot;civilized&quot; centuries before), and a &quot;fervent pity&quot; for those who had never heard the gospel. Schacter adds that &quot;ambivalent benevolence&quot; was at the heart of most British and American attitudes toward Native Americans. The British did not create widespread conversion.

==== In the United States ====

Missionaries played a crucial role in the acculturation of the Cherokee and other American Indians. A peace treaty with the Cherokee in 1794 stimulated a cultural revival and the welcoming of white missionaries, says historian Mark Noll. He has written that &quot;what followed was a slow but steady acceptance of the Christian faith&quot;. Both Christianization and the Cherokee people received a fatal blow after the discovery of gold in north Georgia in 1828. Cherokee land was seized by the government, and the Cherokee people were transported West in what became known as the Trail of tears.

The history of boarding schools for the indigenous populations in Canada and the US is not generally good. While the majority of native children did not attend boarding school at all, of those that did, recent studies indicate a few found happiness and refuge while many others found suffering, forced assimilation, and abuse.

Historian William Gerald McLoughlin has written that, humanitarians who saw the decline of indigenous people with regret, advocated education and assimilation as the native&#x27;s only hope for survival. Over time, many missionaries came to respect the virtues of native culture. &quot;After 1828, most missionaries found it difficult to defend the policies of their government&quot; writes McLoughlin.

The beginning of American Protestant missions abroad followed the sailing of William Carey from England to India in 1793 after the Great awakening.

== Africa (19th to 21st centuries) ==
Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, &quot;New Imperialism&quot; was a second wave of colonialism that took place primarily in the years between 1870 and World War I in 1914. It differed from earlier colonialism in many ways. For example, during this time, colonial powers gained territory at almost three times the rate of the earlier period particularly in what is sometimes referred to as the scramble for Africa.

Some imperial practices, (combined with pre-existing conditions in the colonial states), have had negative long-term effects on the colonial states, socially and politically, as well as on economic development, the development of democracy, and the ability of local governments to accomplish policy goals. The political legacies of colonialism include political instability, violence and ethnic exclusion, which is also linked to civil strife and civil war, while contact with the colonial slave trade has had additional harmful effects.

According to political scientists Alexander de Juan and Jan Henryk Pierskalla, the legacy of Protestant Christianization is largely one of beneficial long-term effects in the areas of human capital, political participation, and democratization. De Juan and Pierskalla add that &quot;Sociologists have identified the key role of Christian missionaries, in particular Protestant missionaries, in generating a democratic legacy for many former colonies, through the spread of literacy, mass printing, and voluntary organizations...&quot;

Theologian Justo Gonzales has written that, while the sixteenth century has generally been seen as the &quot;great age of Catholic expansion&quot;, the nineteenth century was that for Protestantism. This included translating the Bible and other Christian writings into the local language (in more than half of the world&#x27;s over 7000 languages). Missionaries of this era worked with indigenous people to create a written grammar, a listed inventory of native traditions, and a dictionary of their spoken language, (in approximately 90% of those languages). Tracing the impact of this shows local native cultures have responded with &quot;movements of indigenization and cultural liberation&quot;.

Sanneh writes that &quot;The translated scripture ... has become the benchmark of awakening and renewal&quot; in Africa. According to anthropologist Elizabeth Isichei, it is the transition to literacy that translation of scripture and missionary schools created that engendered much of the transformation that followed. In Sanneh&#x27;s view, this means that western missionaries pioneered the &quot;largest, most diverse and most vigorous movement of cultural renewal in [the] history&quot; of Africa.

In 1900 under colonial rule there were just under 9 million Christians in Africa. By 1960, and the end of colonialism there were about 60 million. By 2005, African Christians had increased to 393 million, about half of the continent&#x27;s total population at that time. Population in Africa has continued to grow with the percentage of Christians remaining at about half in 2022. According to Isichei, &quot;The expansion of Christianity in twentieth-century Africa has been so dramatic that it has been called &#x27;the fourth great age of Christian expansion&#x27;.&quot;

=== Zaire ===

Simon Kimbangu&#x27;s movement, the Kimbanguist church, had a radical reputation in its early days in the Congo, was suppressed for forty years, and is now the most studied of all the African prophet movements. It has become an establishment church in Zaire, is very much involved in modern Zairian life, and with upwards of 3 million members, is now the largest independent church in Africa. 

Whether Kimbanguism is a political or a religious movement is resolved by making a distinction between the genuine Kimbanguists and the pseudo-Kimbanguists, also known as the Ngunzists. Of first importance to genuine Kimbanguism is unquestioning acceptance of the intercession of Christ. Measured according to Reformation criteria, the &quot;Church of Jesus Christ of this Earth by the Prophet Simon Kimbangu&quot; (EJCSK) is a Christian religion. However, as James W. Fernandez says, it is a mistake to identify Christianity only with its European version.

Jules Rosette shows how ritual symbolization is the training ground, the interface, for the translation of the African into the Christian, &quot;how ritual vocabulary translates tradition into new practices&quot;. Christianity, she suggests, provides the grammar and syntax, as it were, and traditional customs the lexicon that is formulated by Christianity into a new religious argument.

===Tanzania===
In Tanzania, a child is not a full member of society until they reach adulthood. Adulthood begins at puberty, but a man fully enters adult society by marrying, a woman by giving birth, and the transition from childhood to adulthood is marked by initiation rites. For the Maasai, this includes circumcision of both boys and girls.

Anne Marie Stoner-Eby writes, &quot;The Christianization of initiation rites in the Anglican Diocese of Maasai in what is now southeastern Tanzania is arguably the most famous instance of &#x27;adaptation&#x27; in African mission Christianity.&quot; 
It has long been assumed that Vincent Lucas, Bishop of Maasai (1926–1944), initiated the Christianizing of the initiation rites in an effort to adapt, and not destroy African cultural life, publishing what became a famous essay on &#x27;The Christian Approach to Non-Christian Customs&#x27;.

Initiation was one of a chief&#x27;s most important and prestigious responsibilities, but long before &#x27;adaptation&#x27; became a missionary watchword, Maasai clergy had taken advantage of a crucial increase in their numbers to place &quot;jando la kikristo&quot; (Christian initiation) in place of &quot;unyago wa lupanda&quot; (Lupanda initiation in ancestor worship) by 1913.

===Other countries===
Eastern Maghrib was one of the first three places in the world where Christians were a majority.

In the early twenty-first century outside the United States, Kenya has the largest yearly meeting of Quakers. In Uganda, more Anglicans attend church than do so in England. Ahafo, Ghana is recognized as more vigorously Christian than any place in the United Kingdom. There is revival in East Africa, and vigorous women&#x27;s movements called &quot;Rukwadzano&quot; in Zimbabwe and &quot;Manyano&quot; in South Africa. The Apostles of John Maranke, which began in Rhodesia, now have branches in seven countries.

== Decolonization ==
Just as Christianization had a role in colonialism, it has also played a central role in decolonization moving former colonies toward independence. Shifting beliefs about Christianity&#x27;s role in empire began in France in the 1930s and 40s. Christians were rethinking the relationship between religion and politics. From the 1960s onward, this new understanding of theology combined with Christian activism, was instrumental in motivating indigenous people, such as the Algerians, to work toward and fight for independence from foreign governments. This in turn, influenced global trends. In some colonial societies, Christian missionaries played a transformative role in the development of decolonization and post-colonial Christianity, where in others, the nature of the Christian missionary presence shaped the pattern of decolonization as one of violence and opposition.

In the post-colonial world, it has become necessary for Christianization to break free of its colonial moorings, says Sanneh. Mark Boyle writes that: Christianity&#x27;s historical alignment with the Western project and [the overlapping] histories of colonialism and imperialism raises questions about its capacity to serve as a progressive force in global affairs today. Placing Christianity under postcolonial scrutiny, ... Christianity offers a variety of complex, contradictory, and competing approaches to peace building that variously defend the hegemonic ambitions of the West on the one hand, and support critical practices that usurp and decenter the sovereign supremacy assumed by the West on the other.

== Global Christianization ==
Dana L. Robert has written that one third of the world&#x27;s population is now Christian in a huge variety of forms. The geographic range, cultural diversity and organizational variety of these many types of Christians includes traditional Catholics in Brazil, Apostles in Zimbabwe, Coptic Christians still surviving in Egypt, new Pentecostals in Ghana, established Lutherans in Germany, and secret House church believers in China.

In the early twenty-first century, Christianity has been declining in the West and growing in former colonial lands. Sanneh says Christianity has become the most diverse, pluralist, fastest growing religion in the world.

=== China ===

Joseph Tse-Hei Lee observes that, historically, Christianity has long had a tendency to flourish in areas where there is suffering, dislocation and warfare, and that this is evident in its modern development in China. Chaoshan in northeastern Guangdong Province has transitioned from a state of disintegration in the late Imperial era (960–1895) to one of modern entrepreneurial cosmopolitanism with the aid of Christianization. Indigenization happened quickly and Christianization has survived through family lineage networks, which function like a single corporate unit, and native congregations.

Christianity grew as a grassroots movement in rural areas first, through self-propagation and native agency. This led to an overlap of religious, kinship and territorial identities, so that when the socio-political order shattered, the church was able to step in. Lee sees this as revealing &quot;the importance of the church as a major building block and a viable civic institution in the midst of widespread chaos and unrest&quot;.

Lee writes that hostility toward Christianity as expressed in the Anti-Christian Movement (1925–1926) and in the anti-religious Maoist Era (1949–1976), &quot;the impact of regime change, encounters with secular state-building, the church&#x27;s involvement in transforming local religious and socio-economic landscapes, and the importance of religious agency&quot;, are all key factors in Chinese Christianity. There exists a multiplicity of Chinese Christian experiences and religiosity, and they all tend to reject the view that Christianity is incompatible with modern Chinese culture.

<text>Lake Walen, also known as Lake Walenstadt or  (), is one of the larger lakes in Switzerland. Located in the east of the country, about two thirds of its area are in the canton of St. Gallen and about one third in the canton of Glarus.

Its name means &#x27;Lake of the Walhaz&#x27; (), since in the early Middle Ages Lake Walen formed the linguistic border between the Alemanni, who settled in the west, and the Romansh people, the Walhaz (), in the east.

==Geography==
The lake lies in a valley between the Appenzell Alps to the north and the Glarus Alps to the south. It has a long east-west extension but is relatively narrow in north-south direction, with a surface area of . It has a maximum depth of .

The three main tributaries of the lake are the Seez, Murgbach and Linth. The latter continues its course from Walensee to Obersee (Lake Zurich) through the Linth canal. Until the regulation of the Linth during the early 19th century, the Linth bypassed Walensee west of it and the lake&#x27;s outflow was a river called the Maag, which merged with the Linth near Ziegelbrücke. The Seerenbach Falls and Rinquelle are adjacent to the north of the lake. The Schnittlauchinsel, near the eastern end of the lake, is the only island in the Walensee.

The Churfirsten range raises steeply on the north side from the lake&#x27;s level at to above sea level, joining the Mattstock () and Federispitz () to the west. The Paxmal near Walenstadt overlooks the lake. On the south, the lake is overlooked by the Mürtschenstock Massif, whose peak is above sea level, and the resort area Flumserberg. The highest point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Tödi ().
==Settlements and transportation==
Apart from Walenstadt at the eastern end of the lake, other lakeside towns and villages are Weesen at the western end of the lake and Mühlehorn and Mols, Murg and Unterterzen south of the lake. Quinten, located on the northern shore of the lake, can only be reached on foot from Weesen or Walenstadt via a hiking trail or by boat (e.g. via a ferry from Murg) as there are no roads. Commercial passenger boats are operated by Walensee-Schifffahrt.

To the south, the lake is followed by the A3 motorway and the Ziegelbrücke–Sargans railway line. There is also a continuous bike route along the southern shore. Unterterzen railway station is connected via a gondola lift with Oberterzen and the resort area Flumserberg.

==Arts==
The lake provided the inspiration for a solo piano piece by Hungarian Romantic composer Franz Liszt, Au lac de Wallenstadt. The piece is part of a collection of solo piano works inspired by his travels to Switzerland in the 1830s.

<doc id="621189" wikidata="Q25489458" url="?curid=621189" title="Perineal massage">
<text>Antenatal perineal massage (APM) or Birth Canal Widening (BCW) is the massage of a pregnant woman&#x27;s perineum – the skin and deep tissues around the opening to the vagina (or &#x27;birth canal&#x27; – when a baby is in this passage), performed in the 4 to 6 weeks before childbirth, i.e., 34 weeks or sooner (Reference 7, as more births are occurring at around 28 weeks) and continued weekly until birth. The practice aims to gently mimic the &#x27;massaging&#x27; action of a baby&#x27;s head on the opening to the birth canal (vagina) prior to birth, so works with nature, to achieve the 10 cm diameter opening without using the back of baby&#x27;s head, i.e., doing some of the hard work of labour (birth) before the start of labour, making birth less stressful on the baby and mother. The intention is also to attempt to: eliminate the need for an episiotomy during an instrument (forceps and vacuum extraction) delivery; to prevent blood loss (risk of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome) and tearing of the perineum during birth and in this way avoid infection (cellulitis and necrotising fasciitis of the pelvic floor muscles), helping to keep antibiotics working into the future. This technique uses Plastic Surgeons &#x27;skin tissue expansion&#x27; principle, to aid a natural birth. 

==Description==
The Oxford Radcliffe NHS Trust Document &quot;Antenatal Perineal Massage&quot; 2011 describes the use of the pregnant mother&#x27;s thumbs being placed just inside the birth canal, whilst she stands with one foot supported on the toilet. She pulls backwards towards her spine, whilst relaxing her pelvic floor, progressively increasing the pressure under her finger tips until this starts to feel uncomfortable. On the next occasion she uses both thumbs pulling backwards and then sideways, thumbs away from each other, to enlarge the 2 cm diameter opening of the birth canal progressively over time to 10 cm by progressing to use the four fingers of both hands pulling away from each other, painlessly, to avoid causing tearing. It is not possible to stretch this opening further, because this will be limited by the distance between the bony walls of the pelvis.

If preferred by the mother, a trusted partner can also perform the massage thus avoiding the need for the mother to be standing up and exerting herself. The mother can sit on a floor or in bed with knees bent and slightly apart, and, after applying oil or lubricant, the partner can perform the massage by inserting initially two fingers, pressing down towards the perineum (in the direction of the anus) as far as the pressure is comfortable for the mother. Once this point of maximum pressure is found, hold the position for 30 seconds. Repeat daily, gradually inserting more fingers until able to insert the 4 fingers of both hands i.e. you have stretched to 10 cm.

==Purposes==
The goal of APM is to both prevent the baby&#x27;s head from undergoing excessive strain during the last 30 minutes of labour, by training the mother to relax her pelvic floor to allow the baby&#x27;s head to pass through the opening and also to prevent excessive blood loss in the mother (post-partum haemorrhage), as haemorrhage in childbirth is one of the five leading causes of deaths of mothers in childbirth (maternal deaths) by enabling the mother to completely avoid an episiotomy. The pelvic floor muscle has a very good blood supply and the blood loss caused by an episiotomy, contributes to the blood loss, which occurs when the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus, tipping mothers, who have a prolonged labour, into shock. APM prevents a prolonged labour by stretching the two fibrous layers within the uro-genital membrane, a triangular shaped muscular shelf at the front half of the opening of the bony pelvis, through which the 2 cm diameter birth canal and urethra pass, and the fibrous coats of the pelvic floor muscles, in this way shortening the pushing stage of birth, and transforms the fat packed rigid skin at the opening to the birth canal into paper thin, stretchy elastic skin, all without using the baby&#x27;s head, decreasing the risk of tearing. 
If the external skin (perineal skin) opening is stretched before birth, to 10 cm. diameter, the maximal opening in the bony pelvis (pelvic outlet), then there is no reason to perform an episiotomy,as an episiotomy will not increase the diameter of the opening of the birth canal any further i.e. 10 cm. makes episiotomy obsolete. Tearing is less likely as the external skin at the opening has already been stretched and is lax, whilst the underlying muscular pelvic floor has not been damaged, but made more elastic. Episiotomy permanently damages the pelvic floor muscle, as the episiotomy cuts through both the nerve and the arterial blood supply to this muscle, so the larger part of the pelvic floor muscles atrophies and becomes replaced by scar tissue, increasing the mother&#x27;s chance of developing a prolapse in the future. Antenatal (before birth from &#x27;Anteroir&#x27;- meaning before and &#x27;Natal&#x27; Latin derived from Nativity meaning birth) perineal massage does not damage the pelvic floor, and so protects against a prolapse of the urinary bladder, through the front wall of the vagina, and the rectum, through the back wall of the vagina, and the uterus through the upper part of the vagina.

==History==
Antenatal perineal massage or pre-birth obstetric massage (birth canal widening) was reportedly used by African tribal people. The German obstetrician Mr Welheim Horkel, when visiting a medical mission in the mid-1980s, learned that African tribes used gourds of increasing sizes to stretch the perineum, to avoid tearing during childbirth. He replicated this in a hospital setting using an inflatable silicone balloon naming the device &#x27;Epi-no Delphine Plus, from &#x27;Episiotomy -NO!&#x27;. The Czech have produced an improvement on &#x27;Epi-on Delphine Plus&#x27; naming their device &#x27;Aniball&#x27;. A new perineal massage device, Perimom Perineal Massager was approved for use in the US and in Europe in late 2021 (FDA-registration and CE approval respectively).

West Berkshire England performed an antenatal massage trial in 1984, and many small trials have been performed worldwide since. Cochrane Collaborate Reports since 2006 have advised that women should be informed that episiotomy is avoidable if they employ digital antenatal perineal massage.

==Effectiveness==

A recent meta-analysis involving 11 randomized clinical trials and more than 3,000 patients in total clearly demonstrated that antenatal perineal massage is associated with a lower risk of severe perineal trauma and postpartum complications. Women who received antenatal perineal massage had significantly lower incidence of episiotomies (RR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.72, 0.87], p &lt; 0.001) and perineal tears (RR = 0.79, 95% CI [0.67, 0.94], p = 0.007), particularly the risk of third- and fourth-degree perineal tears (p = 0.03). Better wound healing and less perineal pain were evident in the antenatal perineal massage group. Antenatal perineal massage reduced the second stage of labor duration (p = 0.005) and anal incontinence (p = 0.003) with significant improvement in baby&#x27;s Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02). Perineal massage by minimising blood loss during birth, decreases the risk of Sheehan&#x27;s syndrome - the stroke of &#x27;the hormone control centre&#x27; on the under surface of the brain, called the pituitary. PubMed.gov &#x27;Sheehan&#x27;s in modern times: a nationwide retrospective study Iceland 2011&#x27;.

Finger tip &#x27;Antenatal Perineal Massage&#x27; or &#x27;Birth Canal Widening&#x27; to 10 cm diameter, affords mothers worldwide, irrespective of income, the opportunity to shorten the critical last 30 minutes of labour and improve APGAR score of baby at birth. Mothers with a narrowed opening in their bony pelvis, whether from being born with an abnormally narrow pelvis, from previous fracture or from deformity secondary to infection in the bone (osteomyelitis) or very large baby because of gestational diabetes during the pregnancy, or with conjoint twins, may need surgical intervention, as indicated by a failure to progress either when the baby&#x27;s head fails to enter the bony pelvis or develops fetal distress.

It is known for its small, square hamburgers commonly referred to as &quot;sliders&quot;. The burgers were initially priced at five cents until 1929 and remained at 10 cents until 1949. In the 1940s, White Castle periodically ran promotional ads in local newspapers which contained coupons offering five burgers for ten cents, takeout only. In 2014, &quot;Time&quot; named the White Castle slider &quot;The Most Influential Burger of All Time&quot;. The company&#x27;s restaurant locations are shaped like castles colored white, hence the name. White Castle celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2021.

==History==
===Background===
Walter (Walt) A. Anderson (1880–1963), a cook, had been running food stands in Wichita since 1916, when he opened his first diner in a converted streetcar. After a second and third location, he was looking to open a fourth location when he met Edgar Waldo &quot;Billy&quot; A. Ingram (1880–1966), an insurance and real-estate man, and together they started the White Castle chain.

===Founding and early activity===
White Castle was founded in March 1921 in Wichita, Kansas. Anderson partnered with Ingram to make White Castle into a chain of restaurants and market the brand and its distinctive product. The two men incorporated the business in 1924 and named it White Castle System of Eating Houses Corporation.

Anderson and Ingram started with only $700 for the original White Castle in Wichita, Kansas. The original location was the northwest corner of First and Main; the building is no longer standing.

After the novel &quot;The Jungle&quot; by Upton Sinclair had been published in 1906 and exposed the poor sanitation practices of the meat-packing industry, many Americans became wary of eating ground beef. The founders set out to change the public&#x27;s perception of the cleanliness of the industry they were creating. To invoke a feeling of cleanliness, their restaurants were small buildings with stainless steel interiors, and employees outfitted with spotless uniforms. Their first restaurants in Wichita were a success, and the company branched out into other Midwestern markets, starting in 1922 with El Dorado, Kansas.

===1925: &quot;White Castle Official House Organ&quot;, success, expansion and imitators===
The company also began publishing its own internal employee magazine, the &quot;White Castle Official House Organ&quot;, circa November 1925 (it was originally named &quot;The Hot Hamburger&quot;). The bulk of the material was contributed by company personnel and consisted mostly of letters and photographs of workers, promotional announcements, 25-year milestones, retirements, and similar items of interest arranged by geographic area. &quot;Employees could... read about the progress and innovations made by those in other areas which made everyone aware of the entire system&#x27;s direction and condition.&quot; The &quot;White Castle Official House Organ&quot; was published quarterly at least through the early 1980s, and at some point was renamed &quot;The Slider Times&quot;. The Ohio History Connection houses an extensive archive of White Castle System, Inc. records from 1921 to 1991, including issues dating from 1927 to 1970 of the &quot;White Castle Official House Organ&quot;.

The earliest buildings, such as Indianapolis White Castle #3, built in 1927, had exteriors of white enamel-glazed brick and interiors of enameled steel. The Indianapolis unit was in operation until 1979, making it, at the time of its closure, the longest-operating fast food restaurant in the country. The company constructed this style of building from 1924 to 1929. White Castle Building No. 8 in Minneapolis, Minnesota, originally built in 1936 and remodeled, is an example of the chain&#x27;s buildings with prefabricated white porcelain enamel on steel exteriors. The building measured by and was designed to resemble the Chicago Water Tower, with octagonal buttresses, crenelated towers, and a parapet wall.

The success of White Castle led to numerous imitators. Restaurants copied the distinctive architecture of White Castle buildings, as well as created confusion for consumers by using a similar name. The first of these imitators in Wichita was Little Kastle. Many competitors created their names with a play on the White Castle name. Some restaurant chains just replaced the word &quot;Castle&quot; with their own word (Cabin, Cap, Clock, Crescent, Diamond, Dome, Fortress, Grille, House, Hut, Kitchen, Knight, Log, Manna, Mill, Palace, Plaza, Shop, Spot, Tavern, Tower, Turret, Wonder), while others chose to replace &quot;White&quot; with another color or adjective (Blue, King&#x27;s, Little, Magic, Modern, Prince&#x27;s, Red, Royal, Silver). Some of the other imitators included Castle Blanca, Blue Beacon, Blue Bell, Blue Tower, Krystal, Red Barn, Red Lantern, and Klover Kastle. Despite all the competition, few of the competitors were able to match the success of White Castle.

===1932: Paperlynen subsidiary===

Since fast food was unknown in the United States at the time of White Castle&#x27;s founding, there was no infrastructure to support the business, as is common with today&#x27;s fast-food restaurants. The company established centralized bakeries, meat supply plants, and warehouses to supply itself. It was said that the only things that they did not do themselves were raise the cows and grow their own wheat. Ingram developed a device to produce previously unheard of paper hats (for employees to wear as part of the uniform).

In 1932, Ingram set up a subsidiary, Paperlynen, to produce these hats and other paper products used in his restaurants as well as for many other purposes. At the time, White Castle&#x27;s distribution stretched from Wichita to New York. Ingram decided the central office should be in the center of the distribution area, and in 1936, relocated the central office to Columbus, Ohio. That same year, Ingram decided to close all of the restaurants in the two smallest-profit markets, Wichita and Omaha.

In 1955, Paperlynen produced over 42 million paper hats worldwide with more than 25,000 different inscriptions.

===1934: Porcelain Steel Buildings subsidiary===
White Castle also created a subsidiary in 1934 named Porcelain Steel Buildings that manufactured movable, prefabricated, steel frame structures with porcelain enamel interior and exterior panels that could be assembled at any of its restaurant sites. This is the first known use of this material in a building design.

===Buyout of Anderson, headquarters relocation, and expansion===
In 1933, Anderson sold his half of the business to Ingram, and the following year the company moved its corporate headquarters to Columbus, Ohio. Co-founder Billy Ingram was followed as head of the firm by his son E. W. Ingram Jr. and grandson E. W. Ingram III.

In 1959, White Castle expanded into new markets for the first time since the 1920s. Billy Ingram, who had retired to Miami in 1958, built three White Castle restaurants there. The company closed the Florida operations in 1967 due to inefficient supply distribution.

Throughout its existence, White Castle has been a private company and relied on company-owned stores. It remains privately held today, and its restaurants are all company-owned; none are franchised, except very briefly in Japan during the 1980s and more recently in China since 2017.

===Location expansion, plant-based meat sliders, automation===
The first White Castle in the far western United States opened at the Casino Royale Hotel &amp; Casino on the Las Vegas Strip on January 27, 2015. This was the first expansion for White Castle into a region outside the Midwest and Northeast in 56 years. On the first day of business, demand for food was so great that the restaurant had to temporarily close for two hours to restock. White Castle Vice President Jamie Richardson said that the store sold 4,000 sliders per hour in its first 12 hours. He was not aware of any similar closing due to unexpected demand in White Castle&#x27;s 94-year history. A second White Castle location opened in Las Vegas in September 2017 on Fremont Street, a third opened in Jean at the Terrible&#x27;s Road House in October 2018, a fourth location on Paradise Road in December 2019, and a fifth location in Henderson in June 2022.

In September 2015, White Castle began to offer Veggie Sliders with dairy-free buns to provide a vegan option.

In December 2015, White Castle announced that chief executive officer (CEO) E.W. &quot;Bill&quot; Ingram III would step down at the end of the year, but continue to be chairman of the board. His daughter, Lisa Ingram, then became the fourth CEO of the company.

In 2018, White Castle began offering plant-based meat Impossible Burgers designed to closely mimic the flavor and texture of beef burgers.

The first White Castle location in Arizona opened in Scottsdale on October 23, 2019. A second location opened in nearby Tempe on November 28, 2023. In June 2024, a third Arizona location opened in Goodyear.

White Castle announced on November 25, 2019, that the chain would return to Florida after previously leaving the state in 1968, with plans to open the first restaurant in Orlando. A ghost kitchen, operated out of the restaurant while it was under construction, overloaded Uber Eats when it opened for one day on February 24, 2021. The Orlando location opened on May 3, 2021. It is the world&#x27;s largest White Castle, located on Daryl Carter Parkway off Interstate 4. The opening coincided with White Castle&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

In 2020, White Castle began testing an automated cooking robot called Flippy in a number of its Chicago-area stores, and then equipped a larger number of locations with the updated Flippy 2 model in November 2021. The system is able to discriminate amongst burgers, chicken fingers, and french fries, pick them up, cook them through automated temperature detection and flipping action, place the cooked item in a fry basket, and in turn place the basketed food in an area for holding hot items. The Flippy 2 model can operate without human intervention and produce 60 baskets of food per hour. By the end of 2022, approximately one in three White Castle locations are expected to be equipped with the device.

==Activities==
===United States===

The Ingram family&#x27;s steadfast refusal to franchise, take on debt or offer shares to the public throughout the company&#x27;s existence has kept the chain relatively small, with a more discontinuous geography than its principal competitors. There are currently 345 White Castle outlets, as of May 17, 2024, predominantly in the Midwest, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The exceptions are about 20 White Castle locations in the New York—New Jersey metropolitan area (as of 2020), three locations around Las Vegas, Nevada, three in the Phoenix metropolitan area in Arizona, one in Orlando, Florida, and two in Shanghai, China. By comparison, there are over 36,000 McDonald&#x27;s locations globally, with approximately 14,000 of those in the United States. The chain does, however, sell frozen sliders at supermarkets nationwide, with availability varying by chain.

White Castle currently has locations in the following metropolitan areas in the United States:
* Chicago, Illinois (includes Kenosha, Wisconsin)
* Clarksville, Tennessee
* Cincinnati, Ohio
* Columbia, Missouri
* Columbus, Ohio
* Dayton, Ohio
* Detroit, Michigan
* Indianapolis, Indiana
* Las Vegas, Nevada
* Lexington, Kentucky
* Louisville, Kentucky
* Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota
* Nashville, Tennessee
* New York – New Jersey (includes Allentown, Pennsylvania)
* Orlando, Florida
* Phoenix, Arizona (no locations in Phoenix proper)
* St. Louis, Missouri

Louisville and Columbus also house bulk-manufacturing (grocery-store sales, meat, and bun production) divisions. Company headquarters and the Porcelain Steel Buildings division are in Columbus, Ohio.

In the late 20th century, White Castle tried expanding into three new cities, Philadelphia, Kansas City, and Cleveland-Akron. Those restaurants closed within several years. Afer a several decade hiatus, the company returned to the Kansas City area in 1985 only to leave again in 2001. White Castle entered the Cleveland-Akron area in 1987 and then exited in December 2014.

===International activities===
Since 2021 when its restaurants in China closed, White Castle does not currently have any restaurants outside of the continental United States.

Through franchise deals with local corporate business partners, White Castle briefly had restaurants outside of the United States in Singapore, Malaysia, and Japan during the late 1980s and early 1990s, but the concept never caught on in those countries. During the same time period, White Castle also tried to establish franchised operations in Mexico and South Korea, but these restaurants also failed. The lone Korean restaurant in Seoul was quietly closed by 1993.

In 1986, White Castle opened its first Japanese restaurant in the city of Osaka via a franchise deal with a Japanese company. There are no reliable records that show when this location closed and when the company finally left the Japanese marketplace. By the end of 1986, the Japanese franchise had six restaurants with a seventh opened by the following year.

In June 1989, White Castle and its local franchise partner Innovest Bhd. opened seven restaurants in Malaysia. Innovest franchise territory included Malaysia and Singapore, and the company had plans to open three more restaurants by the end of the year, with the possibility of having a total of 20 restaurants within its two country region by the following year.

The first White Castle franchised location in Mexico opened in Mexico City in 1996, but it also closed after a brief trial run.

In 2017, White Castle opened its first and second restaurants in China in the city of Shanghai through a partnership with Shanghai-based ClearVue Partners. In addition to beef sliders, the Shanghai location also sold a spicy tofu slider and a cherry duck slider, which is smoked duck topped with a sweet cherry sauce. At the time of their openings, these two restaurants were the only White Castle restaurants located outside of the United States. These locations were closed by September 2021.

===Canada===
Although White Castle has never opened any restaurants in Canada, Canadians have been able to purchase White Castle hamburgers from the frozen foods section in select Canadian grocery and convenience stores since 2015 and more recently at Walmart. For the production of the 2004 film &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot;, a full-size outlet was built in Caledon, Ontario, but never commissioned opened to the local public, instead reopened as &quot;Yuppie&#x27;s Burgers&quot;, only to go quickly bankrupt (later converted to an Ultramar gas station). White Castle currently has no locations in Canada.

===Former international locations===
* Malaysia – 1989/90
* Japan – 1986
* South Korea – 1993/1994
* Singapore
* Mexico – 1996
* Hong Kong
* Bahamas
* China – 2017–2021

==Products and marketing==

White Castle also markets its sandwiches in 20 or 30-hamburger boxes, called a Crave Clutch or Crave Case, respectively. The figure of 30 burgers represents the number that can be produced on one of its standard griddles at the same time. A &quot;Crave Crate&quot; is also offered, with the contents being 100 burgers.

To celebrate its 100th year in operation, White Castle re-introduced their original burger, called the 1921 Slider. It features an addition of lettuce, tomato, and caramelized onions. Typically normal sliders have 5 holes in the patty while cooking on a griddle of onions and water to steam the sliders to completion. The 1921 is grilled directly on the griddle instead.

A variety of White Castle products (mostly frozen) are also sold in grocery stores.

Some locations had been cobranded with Church&#x27;s Chicken until that co-branding arrangement ended around 2010.

Around 2012, White Castle experimented with the Laughing Noodle brand that was to share space with White Castle restaurants. The Laughing Noodle concept was discarded a few years later. The Laughing Noodle brand was developed to offer supplemental variety to a White Castle Restaurant. At least one such location was constructed and operated in Sharonville, Ohio.

Although White Castle originated in Wichita, Kansas, the city has not had a restaurant since 1938, nor is there a White Castle restaurant in the entire state of Kansas. White Castle is one of the few restaurant chains that does not have a location in its original city. In the early 2000s, White Castle tried expanding into the Kansas City market, with at least one location in Kansas, but those restaurants were closed several years later.

In April 2020, White Castle responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by announcing that the chain would be delivering free meals to healthcare workers. White Castle also offered a free dessert in the month of May 2021 to anyone who showed a vaccination certificate. In certain regions, White Castle offered four hours of paid time off for workers who get both doses of an eligible COVID-19 vaccination and present their vaccination certificate to management.

==Non-traditional sales==
Due to their limited restaurant locations throughout the United States, White Castle had developed a cult following among former customers who develop a craving for their hamburger in areas not served by their restaurants. By the early 1980s, these customers would go to extreme length to obtain White Castle burgers, such as having friends and relative ship the burgers to them.

In November 1980, the town officials of Fountain Hills, Arizona, placed an order for 10,000 hamburgers to be sold at a town festival as part of a fundraiser. The following year, the town create an annual festival that was held each May called Midwest Fest or Midwest Festival in which 100,000 or more hamburgers were purchased and sold as part of a fundraiser. By the middle of the decade, several other western cities were purchasing hundreds of thousands of burgers at a time for fundraisers. In 1982, a Dayton disc jockey sent 3,000 burgers to 1,200 U.S. Marines stationed in Beirut.

In late 1982, White Castle established a toll free phone line in which customers can order as few as 50 burgers to be shipped frozen to any metropolitan area in the United States serviced by Federal Express for as low as $57 as part of a program called &quot;Hamburgers to Fly&quot;. By early 1983, White Castle was shipping 10,000 hamburgers per week via FedEx.

Based on the success of the sale of hamburgers shipped via air express, White Castle decided to expand their frozen hamburgers distribution by selling the burgers through supermarkets. In May 1986, the company test marketed the concept by selling through grocery stores in Denver and Indianapolis. By the following year, the test was expanded to include Columbus, Ohio, and Portland, Oregon. By 2014, retail sales were eventual expanded to all 50 states with sales conducted through supermarkets, c-stores, vending machines, concessions, military, drug, club, mass and dollar stores.

Frozen White Castle hamburgers became available to Canadians in 2015 through various convenience stores and later became available at Canadian Walmart stores in 2018.

==Impact==
Anderson is credited with the invention of the hamburger bun as well as &quot;the kitchen as assembly line, and the cook as infinitely replaceable technician,&quot; hence giving rise to the modern fast-food phenomenon. Due to White Castle&#x27;s innovation of having chain-wide standardized methods, customers could be sure that they would receive the same product and service in every White Castle restaurant.

Ingram&#x27;s business savvy was responsible not only for White Castle&#x27;s success but also for the popularization of the hamburger. &quot;Time&quot; ranked the White Castle slider &quot;The Most Influential Burger of All Time&quot; in its January 14, 2014, edition.

The restaurant is a central plot device of the comedy film &quot;Harold &amp; Kumar Go to White Castle&quot;.

<text>Linum bienne, the pale or narrowleaf flax, is a flowering plant in the genus &quot;Linum&quot;, native to the Mediterranean region and western Europe, north to England and Ireland.

Pale flax grows as a biennial or perennial plant in dry, sunny calcareous or neutral grasslands from sea level up to 1000 m. It has long, narrow stems to 60 cm tall and slender leaves 1.5–2.5 cm long. The flowers have five petals about 1 cm long and nearly round; they are pale blue but streaked with darker colour. It flowers in late spring and, at least in more temperate regions, through the summer. The flowers are monoecious and are pollinated by bees and wasps.

&quot;Linum bienne&quot; (=&quot;L. angustifolium&quot;) is considered the probable wild forebear of the cultivated flax, and a fibre can be made from its stem. It is sometimes grown as a garden plant.

It has been introduced into North America, where it is naturalized on the Pacific coast from Oregon to the central coast of California, and also in Pennsylvania; it is found in Hawaii, as well.

<text>Emil Petrovici (; 1899–1968) was a Romanian linguist, dialectologist and Slavist. He studied both Romanian and Serbian languages. His studies included Romanian phonology, and Romanian, Serbian, and other Slavic dialectology.

Petrovici was born in the village of Torak (former &quot;Begejci&quot;), at the time part of Austria-Hungary, now in northern Serbia.

From 1949 to 1954, Petrovici worked on literary and cultural problems of Transylvania and collaborated on several journals published in Cluj. He was honored with membership in several scientific academies and societies, and was honored with various titles such as (&quot;Emeritus scientist&quot;) and (&quot;The State Prize&quot;). He died in the Bucerdea train collision in 1968.

==Works==

Among his many books were:
* (&quot;On nasalization in the Romanian language&quot;)
* (&quot;Language of Krashovani&quot;)
* (&quot;Folklore from the Almajului Valley&quot;, 1935)
* (&quot;Folklore of the Moţii of Scărişoara&quot;, 1939)
* (&quot;Notes on the folklore of the Romanians of the Mlava Valley&quot;, 1942)
* (&quot;Dialect Texts&quot;, Leipzig, 1943)

<doc id="621215" wikidata="Q5141644" url="?curid=621215" title="Cointerpretability">
<text>In mathematical logic, cointerpretability is a binary relation on formal theories: a formal theory &quot;T&quot; is cointerpretable in another such theory &quot;S&quot;, when the language of &quot;S&quot; can be translated into the language of &quot;T&quot; in such a way that &quot;S&quot; proves every formula whose translation is a theorem of &quot;T&quot;. The &quot;translation&quot; here is required to preserve the logical structure of formulas. 

This concept, in a sense dual to interpretability, was introduced by , who also proved that, for theories of Peano arithmetic and any stronger theories with effective axiomatizations, cointerpretability is equivalent to formula_1-conservativity.

<text>The Australian Graduate School of Management (AGSM @ UNSW Business School) is a postgraduate management and business school that is part of the UNSW Business School at the University of New South Wales (UNSW Sydney), in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. The AGSM offers general management, executive and leadership development programs.

AGSM offers Fulltime MBA, MBA (Executive), MBAX (an online MBA with specialisations in Change, Finance, Law, Social Impact and Technology), Master of Management, Graduate Certificates with specialisations in Change Management, Digital Innovation, Leadership, Management, Strategic Management or Technology Management) and short course executive education programs in Australia and online. For many years the school&#x27;s MBA program has been ranked by the &quot;Financial Times&quot; as the best in Australia.

== History ==
In 1977, UNSW established the AGSM as New South Wales&#x27; second school of postgraduate management studies. In January 1999, the AGSM and the Graduate School of Business of the University of Sydney merged under the AGSM brand. In November 2005, the universities demerged their business schools and the AGSM reverted to wholly UNSW ownership.

One year later, UNSW merged the AGSM with the UNSW Faculty of Commerce and Economics, creating the Faculty of Business (later the Australian School of Business).

In mid-2007, the faculties physically combined, and moved into UNSW&#x27;s newly renovated Heffron Building, which UNSW renamed the Australian School of Business Building.

In 2011 Professor Chris Styles was appointed as Deputy Dean and Director AGSM, and the Master of Business &amp; Technology program was added to AGSM offering. In June 2014, Professor Julie Cogin was appointed Director of AGSM, following the elevation of Professor Styles to Dean of the UNSW Business School. The current Director of AGSM is Professor Nick Wailes.

==Programs==
The AGSM offers a full-time MBA program in Sydney which generally takes 12 months to complete. Alternatively, students can complete one of two part-time MBAs - AGSM MBA (Executive) or the MBAX (where &#x27;x&#x27; stands for a student&#x27;s chosen specialisation), an AGSM Graduate Certificate.

<doc id="621228" wikidata="Q3398036" url="?curid=621228" title="Population of Canada">
<text>Canada ranks 37th by population among countries of the world, comprising about 0.5% of the world&#x27;s total, with more than 40 million Canadians as of 2024. Despite being the second-largest country by total area (fourth-largest by land area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north. Just over 60 percent of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. Though Canada&#x27;s overall population density is low, many regions in the south, such as the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, have population densities higher than several European countries. Canada has six population centres with more than one million people: Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Ottawa.

The large size of Canada&#x27;s north, which is currently not arable, and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the country&#x27;s carrying capacity. In 2021, the population density of Canada was 4.2 people per square kilometre. 

The historical growth of Canada&#x27;s population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as Indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Immigration has been, and remains, the most important factor in Canada&#x27;s population growth. The 2021 Canadian census counted a total population of 36,991,981, an increase of around 5.2 per cent over the 2016 figure. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 per cent overall growth.

==Historical population overview==

===Indigenous peoples===

A variety of estimations have been postulated for the Indigenous population in what is now Canada prior to European contact. Estimates of this population during the late 15th century range between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 currently accepted by Canada&#x27;s Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. Although not without conflict, European Canadians&#x27; early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful. However repeated outbreaks of European infectious diseases such as influenza, measles and smallpox (to which they had no natural immunity), combined with other effects of European contact, resulted in a twenty-five per cent to eighty per cent Indigenous population decrease post-contact. Roland G Robertson suggests that during the late 1630s, smallpox killed over half of the Wyandot (Huron), who controlled most of the early North American fur trade in the area of New France. In 1822 the Indigenous Canadian population, excluding the Métis, was estimated as 283,500 people. In 1871 there was an enumeration of the Indigenous population within the limits of Canada at the time, showing a total of only 102,358 individuals. In 1885 the number of Indigenous people in Canada was reported as 131,952 individuals. From 2006 to 2016, the Indigenous population has grown by 42.5 per cent, four times the national rate. The Indigenous population representing 5 percent or 1.8 million individuals, grew by 9.4 percent compared to the non-Indigenous population, which grew by 5.3 percent from 2016 to 2021. The 2021 Census data reveals that there are over 1. 8 million Indigenous people in Canada, comprising 5. 0% of the overall Canadian population, a slight increase from 4. 9% in 2016,

===New France===

The European population grew slowly under French rule, thus remained relatively low as growth was largely achieved through natural births, rather than by immigration. Most of the French were farmers, and the rate of natural increase among the settlers themselves was very high. The women had about 30 per cent more children than comparable women who remained in France. Demographer Yves Landry says, &quot;Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time.&quot; The 1666 census of New France was the first census conducted in North America. It was organized by Jean Talon, the first Intendant of New France, between 1665 and 1666. According to Talon&#x27;s census there were 3,215 people in New France, comprising 538 separate families. The census showed a great difference in the number of men at 2,034 versus 1,181 women. By the early 1700s the New France settlers were well established along the Saint Lawrence River and Acadian Peninsula with a population around 15,000 to 16,000. Mainly due to natural increase and modest immigration from Northwest France (Brittany, Normandy, Île-de-France, Poitou-Charentes and Pays de la Loire) the population of New France increased to 55,000 according to the last French census of 1754. This was an increase from 42,701 in 1730.

===British Canada===

During the late 18th and early 19th century Canada under British rule experienced strong population growth. In the wake of the 1775 invasion of Canada by the newly formed Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War, approximately 60,000 of the 80,000 Americans loyal to the Crown, designated later as United Empire Loyalists fled to British North America, a large portion of whom migrated to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick (separated from Nova Scotia) in 1784. Although the exact numbers cannot be certain because of unregistered migration At least 20,000 went to Nova Scotia, 14,000 to New Brunswick; 1,500 to PEI and 6,000 to Ontario(13,000 including 5,000 blacks went to England and 5,500 to the Caribbean). For the rest of the 1780s additional immigrants arrived from the south. From 1791 An additional 30,000 Americans, called &quot;Late Loyalists&quot;, were lured into Ontario in the 1790s by the promise of land and swearing loyalty to the Crown. As a result of the period known as the Great Migration by 1831, Lower Canada&#x27;s population had reached approximately 553,000, with Upper Canada reaching about 237,000 individuals. The Great Famine of Ireland of the 1840s had significantly increased the pace of Irish immigration to Prince Edward Island and the Province of Canada, peaking in 1847 with 100,000 distressed individuals. By 1851, the population of the Maritime colonies also reached roughly 533,000 (277,000 in Nova Scotia, 194,000 in New Brunswick and 62,000 in Prince Edward Island). To the west British Columbia had about 55,000 individuals by 1851. Beginning in the late 1850s, the immigration of Chinese into the Colony of Vancouver Island and Colony of British Columbia peaked with the onset of the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. By 1861, as a result of natural births and the Great Migration of Canada from the British Isles, the Province of Canada population increased to 3.1 million inhabitants. Newfoundland&#x27;s population by 1861 reached approximately 125,000 individuals.

===Post-confederation===
The population has increased every year since the establishment of the Dominion of Canada in 1867; however, the population of Newfoundland was not included prior to its entry into confederation as Canada&#x27;s tenth province in 1949. The first national census of the country was taken in 1871, with a population count around 3,689,000. The year with the least population growth (in real terms) was 1882–1883, when only 30,000 new individuals were enumerated.

The 1911 census was a detailed enumeration of the population showing a count of 7,206,643 individuals. This was an increase of 34% over the 1901 census of 5,371,315. The year with the most population growth was during the peak of the Post-World War II baby boom in 1956–1957, when the population grew by over 529,000, in a single twelve-month period. The Canadian baby boom, defined as the period from 1947 to 1966, saw more than 400,000 babies born annually. The 1996 census recorded a total population of 28,846,761. This was a 5.7% increase over the 1991 census of 27,296,859. The 2001 census had a total population count of 30,007,094. In contrast, the official Statistics Canada population estimate for 2001 was 31,021,300.

Canada&#x27;s total population enumerated by the 2006 census was 31,612,897. This count was lower than the official 1 July 2006 population estimate of 32,623,490 people. Ninety per cent of the population growth between 2001 and 2006 was concentrated in the main metropolitan areas. The 2011 census was the fifteenth decennial census with a total population count of 33,476,688 up 5.9% from 2006. On average, censuses have been taken every five years since 1905. Censuses are required to be taken at least every ten years as mandated in section 8 of the Constitution Act, 1867.

==Components of population growth==
A population estimate for 2022 put the total number of people in Canada at 38,232,593.

*One death every 2 minutes
*One net migrant every 2 minutes
*Net gain of one person every 2 minutes

In 2010, Canada&#x27;s annual population growth rate was 1.238%, or a daily increase of 1,137 individuals. Between 1867 and 2009 Canada&#x27;s population grew by 979%. Canada had the highest net migration rate (0.61%) of all G-8 member countries between 1994 and 2004. Natural growth accounts for an annual increase of 137,626 persons, at a yearly rate of 0.413%. Between 2001 and 2006, there were 1,446,080 immigrants and 237,418 emigrants, resulting in a net migration of just over 1.2 million people. Since 2001 until 2010, immigration has ranged between 221,352 and 262,236 immigrants per annum.

In 2023, Canada&#x27;s population jumped by over 1 million people for the first time in the country&#x27;s history. The population now stands at 39.5 million and is set to pass the 40 million mark later this year. The population growth has largely been fuelled by migrants who have been brought into the country to ease labour shortages.
==Population by years ==
Prior to Canadian confederation in 1867 the population counts reflected only the former colonies and settlements and not the country to be as a whole with Indigenous nations separated.

===Ephemeral European settlements===
===Former colonies and territories ===
The first in date of the Colonies which became successful, and which consequently marked the starting point of European settlements on what would be Canada , was the foundation of Port Royal, Acadia.

==Census data by years==

==Data projections==
In 2006, Statistics Canada projected for the decade 2021 to 2031 the population to grow by more than 5 million, or more than 10%. Between 1990 and 2008, the population increased by 5.6 million, equivalent to 20.4 per cent overall growth. The 2016 Canadian census counted a total population of 35.1 million, or 1.5 million under the 2006 projection.

In October 2020, the Trudeau government announced its plans to bring in more than 1.2 million immigrants over the subsequent three years, to catch up to the high-growth scenario.

<text>In mathematical logic, a tolerant sequence is a sequence 

:formula_1...,formula_2 

of formal theories such that there are consistent extensions 

:formula_3...,formula_4 

of these theories with each formula_5 interpretable in formula_6. Tolerance naturally generalizes from sequences of theories to trees of theories. Weak interpretability can be shown to be a special, binary case of tolerance. 

This concept, together with its dual concept of cotolerance, was introduced by Japaridze in 1992, who also proved that, for Peano arithmetic and any stronger theories with effective axiomatizations, tolerance is equivalent to formula_7-consistency.

<doc id="621234" wikidata="Q1139440" url="?curid=621234" title="Crediton">
<text>Crediton is a town and civil parish in the Mid Devon district of Devon, England. It stands on the A377 Exeter to Barnstaple road at the junction with the A3072 road to Tiverton, north west of Exeter and from the M5 motorway. It has a population of 21,990.

The town is in the narrow vale of the River Creedy, between two steep hills and is divided into two parts, the north or old town and the south and east or new town.

==History==

The first indication of settlement at Crediton is the claim that Winfrith or Saint Boniface was born here in c. 672. He propagated Christianity in the Frankish Empire during the 8th century and is the patron saint of both Germany and the Netherlands. In 909 a see was established here with Edwulf as the first bishop. Nine more bishops ruled here until 1050, when Leofric obtained papal permission from Pope Leo IX to transfer the seat to Exeter, a more culturally aware, larger and walled town. Since 1897 Crediton has been the seat of a suffragan bishopric in the Diocese of Exeter; from 2004 until 2012 this was Robert Evens, between 2012 and 2015 it was Nick McKinnel (who was translated to the Anglican See of Plymouth). The current bishop of Crediton is Jackie Searle, who has been the bishop since 2018.

At the Domesday survey (1086) much of the land was still uncultivated, but its prosperity increased, and in 1269 each of the twelve prebends of the collegiate church had a house and farmland within the parish. The bishops to whom the manor belonged until the Reformation had difficulty in enforcing their warren and other rights; in 1351 Bishop Grandisson obtained an exemplification of judgments of 1282, declaring that he had pleas of withername, a view of frankpledge, the gallows and assize of bread and ale. Two years later there was a serious riot against the increase of copyhold.

The jury of the borough are mentioned in 1275, and Crediton returned two members to parliament during the reign of Edward I, in 1306–07, though it was never afterwards represented again. A borough seal dated 1469 is extant, but the corporation is not mentioned in the grant made by Edward VI of the church to twelve principal inhabitants. The borough and manor were granted by Elizabeth I to William Killigrew in 1595, but there is no indication of town organization then or in 1630, and in the 18th century Crediton was governed by commissioners.

The wool trade was established by 1249, and the manufacture and trading of woollen cloth, especially serge, peaked in the 16th century when the town reached the height of its prosperity. In 1630 the market for kerseys was mentioned in conjunction with a saying &quot;as fine as Kirton spinning&quot;. The woollen textile trade declined after the mid 18th century.

During the English Civil War the Earl of Essex passed through the town on 20 July 1644 on his way to Cornwall, and evidently left the town and surrounding countryside in some disarray. He was closely followed by Charles I who arrived on 27 July to review the army gathered there by his nephew, Prince Maurice, before returning to Exeter for a council of war. The following Sunday, the King spent the night at Crediton and then began his expedition of &quot;Essex-catching&quot;.

In late 1645 and early 1646 the town was used as a base by Thomas Fairfax and the New Model Army from where they marched on the Royalist forces gathering in North Devon, and to where they returned on 29 March 1646 after success both at the Battle of Torrington and in overturning the siege of Plymouth.

On Sunday 14 August 1743, a great fire started, completely destroying High Street and buildings in the &quot;West Town&quot;. At that period of time it was the second largest fire in the country, second only to the Great Fire of London. Sixteen people lost their lives, with over 2,000 made homeless and 450 houses destroyed. Other large fires occurred in 1766, 1769 and 1772. The Old Town Hall was completed in 1852.

The town is twinned with Avranches, France.

==Economy==

In the early 20th century shoe-making, tanning, agricultural trade, tin-plating and the manufacture of confectionery and cider had superseded the former large woollen and serge industries.

The creamery and dairy in Crediton has always been located next to the church, but to enable its product to be distributed further, the company ran a transport depot that was located in the goods yard of the railway station. Every day, a train of three or more Milk Tank Wagons would be filled from lorries, and then taken to London by either the Great Western Railway or the Southern Railway. Express Dairies sold the creamery and a similar unit in Kirkcudbright, Scotland in July 2002 to Milk Link, which both by that time produced UHT milk. Milk Link merged with Arla Foods in 2012 but in 2013 the newly merged company sold its Crediton operations in a management buyout. The new company, Crediton Dairy Limited, began trading in April 2013.

Today, the town has two industrial parks at Lords Meadow and Fordton, a dairy and a small collection of units at Westward Business Park. It is the centre for shopping and business for the surrounding area, and has industries such as graphics and pharmaceuticals.

Bristow&#x27;s of Devon, founded in 1932 was one of the town&#x27;s main employers but was closed in 2011 after owner New McCowan&#x27;s went into administration. The factory, on Lords Meadow Industrial Estate, was reopened by Crediton Confectionery which has taken over the Bristow&#x27;s brand.

In 2001 the Crediton area was given priority status with regard to the government&#x27;s Market and Coastal Towns Initiative, following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease. By 2006, of 45 projects in the plan, 18 had been completed, resolved, or begun.

==Sport and leisure==

Crediton has a Football Club, (a Crediton United A.F.C.), (affiliated to the FA) which fields both Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s teams in Senior and Junior competition in local leagues.

Crediton has a Rugby Club (affiliated to the RFU) which has three senior teams, one colts team and a strong girls and Junior section.

Crediton has a running club Crediton Running Network which meets at the Lords Meadow Leisure Centre

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Stockland Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, East Devon Radio and Radio Exe.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Crediton Courier which publishes on Fridays.

==Transport==
Crediton railway station was designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, was opened by the Exeter and Crediton Railway on 12 May 1851 and lies on Station Approach and Exeter Road. The line to {{stnlnk|Barnstaple}} was then opened by the North Devon Railway on 1 August 1854. After 1 November 1865 additional London and South Western Railway trains ran through the station going towards Okehampton. It is currently the junction of the Tarka and Dartmoor lines, though the two lines run parallel until Coleford Junction. Crediton is served by all trains on the Barnstaple to Exeter and Okehampton to Exeter services. They connect with main line services at {{stnlnk|Exeter St Davids}}.

The Exeter to Plymouth railway of the LSWR has been reopened to connect Okehampton via Crediton and Exeter with the rest of the UK railway system. There are proposals to reopen the line from Tavistock to Bere Alston for a through service to Plymouth.

On the night of 4 February 2014, amid high winds and extremely rough seas, part of the sea wall at Dawlish was breached washing away around {{convert|40|m}} of the wall and the ballast under the railway immediately behind. The line was closed. Network Rail began repair work and the line reopened on 4 April 2014. In the wake of widespread disruption caused by damage to the mainline track at Dawlish by coastal storms in February 2014, Network Rail are considering reopening the Tavistock to Okehampton and Exeter section of the line as an alternative to the coastal route.

The nearest airport is at Exeter International.

Crediton lies around {{convert|14|mi}} from the M5 motorway, Exeter to Bristol and {{convert|12|mi}} from the A30 and A38.

==Education==
Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School, founded by Edward VI and refounded by Elizabeth I, is today a state-run academy, named for Queen Elizabeth I which gets good GCSE and A level results. There are two primary schools: Hayward&#x27;s Primary School and Landscore Primary School. Nearby in the village of the same name is Sandford School and ten other partner primaries.

* Southeast of the town, on a ridge overlooking the river, is the country house, Downes, built about 1692 and remodelled in the 18th century. It was the birthplace of Sir Redvers Buller whose family were lords of the manor of Crediton.
* The northwest side of the town had a great wall built in 1276 and it is still partly remaining today, although now it looks no different from a normal garden wall.

<doc id="621235" wikidata="Q1350269" url="?curid=621235" title="Jon Faddis">
<text>Jon Faddis (born July 24, 1953) is an American jazz trumpet player, conductor, composer, and educator, renowned for both his playing and for his expertise in the field of music education. Upon his first appearance on the scene, he became known for his ability to closely mirror the sound of trumpet icon Dizzy Gillespie, who was his mentor along with pianist Stan Kenton and trumpeter Bill Catalano.

==Biography==
Jon Faddis was born in Oakland, California, United States. He played trumpet in the Oakland Symphony&#x27;s Youth Chamber Orchestra, directed by composer Robert Hughes. In 1970 he participated in the YCO historic performance program and tour of &quot;The Black Composer in America&quot; to the American South, later recorded on the Desto label. At 18, he joined Lionel Hampton&#x27;s big band before joining the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra as lead trumpet. After playing with Charles Mingus in his early twenties, Faddis became a noted studio musician in New York City, appearing on many pop recordings in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

One such recording was the Players Association&#x27;s cover of &quot;Disco Inferno&quot;, from their LP &quot;Born to Dance&quot; (1977), on which he plays trumpet. In the mid-1980s, he left the studios to continue to pursue his solo career, which resulted in albums such as &quot;Legacy&quot; (1985), &quot;Into the Faddisphere&quot; (1989) and &quot;Hornucopia&quot; (1991). He became the director and main trumpet soloist of the Dizzy Gillespie 70th Birthday Big Band and Dizzy&#x27;s United Nation Orchestra.

From 1992 to 2002, Faddis led the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band (CHJB) at Carnegie Hall, conducting more than 40 concerts in ten years, during which time the CHJB presented over 135 musicians, featured over 70 guest artists, and premiered works by over 35 composers and arrangers at Carnegie Hall.

In 1997, Faddis composed the jazz opera &quot;Lulu Noire&quot;, which was presented at USA in Charleston, South Carolina, as well as at the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia. 

Faddis appeared in the 1998 movie &quot;Blues Brothers 2000&quot;, playing trumpet with the Louisiana Gator Boys.

In 1999, Faddis released the Grammy Award-nominated &quot;Remembrances&quot; (Chesky Records), which was composed almost entirely of ballads and featured work from Argentinian composer/arranger Carlos Franzetti.

Faddis also led the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars and the Dizzy Gillespie Alumni All-Stars Big Band from their inception in 1998 through 2004, when he was appointed artistic director of the Chicago Jazz Ensemble (CJE), based at Columbia College Chicago in Illinois. Faddis led the CJE from autumn 2004 though spring 2010, premiering significant new works, pioneering educational initiatives in Chicago public schools focusing on Louis Armstrong&#x27;s music, and bringing the CJE into new venues (including presenting the first of the &quot;Made in Chicago&quot; Jazz series at the Pritzker Pavilion in Millennium Park), while concurrently leading the Jon Faddis Jazz Orchestra of New York (the successor to the Carnegie Hall Jazz Band).

In 2006, the Jon Faddis Quartet released the CD &quot;Teranga&quot; (Koch Records, now E1), featuring guests including Clark Terry, Russell Malone, Gary Smulyan, and Frank Wess.

As of May 2010, Faddis leads the JFJONY, while continuing also to lead the Jon Faddis Quartet and the JFQ+2. The JFJONY headlined The Kennedy Center&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve performance in December 2010 (available as a podcast on NPR&#x27;s JazzSet); the JFJONY has also performed at the Kimmel Center in Philadelphia, the Performing Arts Center in Westchester, New York, the Newport Jazz Festival and other venues.

Faddis is also a noted educator for jazz and the trumpet. Faddis has taught – and continues to teach – at the Conservatory of Music at Purchase College-SUNY, in Westchester, New York, where he teaches trumpet, classes, and an ensemble. He also leads master classes, clinics and workshops around the world, often bringing students to his gigs and allowing them to sit in, and has produced a number of CDs for up-and-coming musicians.

In July 2011, he played a tribute to Miles Davis at the Prague Castle, hosted by the Czech President, Václav Klaus, accompanied by Lenny White on drums, Jaroslav Jakubovič on baritone saxophone, Tom Barney on bass and Emil Viklický on piano.

Faddis is a Schilke Performing Artist, performing on the Schilke &quot;Faddis&quot; model trumpet. He has played Schilke instruments since 1970, encompassing nearly his entire career and complete discography.

==Family and personal life==
Faddis has been a resident of Teaneck, New Jersey.

Faddis is the uncle of Madlib and Oh No, acclaimed hip-hop producers.

<doc id="621236" wikidata="Q5942652" url="?curid=621236" title="Hung jury">
<text>A hung jury, also called a deadlocked jury, is a judicial jury that cannot agree upon a verdict after extended deliberation and is unable to reach the required unanimity or supermajority. A hung jury may result in the case being tried again.

This situation can occur only in common law legal systems. Civil law systems either do not use juries at all or provide that the defendant is immediately acquitted if the majority or supermajority required for conviction is not reached during a singular, solemn vote.

== Australia ==
Majority (or supermajority verdicts) are in force in South Australia, Tasmania, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Australian Capital Territory and Commonwealth courts require unanimous verdicts in criminal (but not civil) trials.

== Canada==
In Canada, the jury must reach a unanimous decision on criminal cases. If the jury cannot reach a unanimous decision, a hung jury is declared. A new panel of jurors will be selected for the retrial. Each jury in criminal courts contains 12 jurors. In civil cases, only six people are necessary for a jury, and if there is only one dissenter (i.e. a 5–1 vote), the dissenter can be ignored with the majority opinion becoming the final verdict.

== New Zealand ==
In New Zealand, the jury must try to reach a unanimous verdict. If the jury cannot reach a unanimous verdict after a reasonable time given the nature and complexity of the case (but not less than four hours), then the court may accept a majority verdict. In criminal cases, an all-but-one vote is needed (i.e. 11–1 with a full jury); in civil cases, a three-quarters (75%) vote is needed (i.e. 9–3 with a full jury). 

If the jury fails to reach either a unanimous or majority verdict after a reasonable time, the presiding judge may declare a hung jury. Ordinarily there will be a new trial. If the retrial also results in a hung jury, the case must be referred to the Solicitor-General, who will generally issue a stay of proceedings unless there are compelling reasons to proceed with a third trial.

== United Kingdom ==

=== England and Wales ===

Majority verdicts have been allowed in England and Wales since the Criminal Justice Act 1967. Before this all criminal convictions required a unanimous verdict. At least 10 votes out of 12 is needed for a valid majority verdict. If fewer jurors remain, majorities allowed are 11–0, 10–1, 10–0, 9–1 and 9–0. Failure to reach this may lead to a retrial (&quot;R v. Bertrand&quot;, 1807). 

Initially, the jury will be directed to try to reach a unanimous verdict. If they fail to reach a unanimous verdict, the judge may later give directions that a majority verdict will be acceptable, although the jury should continue to try to reach a unanimous verdict if possible. The judge may not give these directions before at least two hours of deliberation, however in practice it is often given after much longer than two hours.

When the jury is called to deliver a verdict after majority directions have been given, a careful protocol of questions is followed: only in the event of a guilty verdict is it asked whether all jurors were agreed on that verdict, to prevent any acquittal from being tainted by it being disclosed that any jurors dissented. The protocol is followed separately for each charge. Majority verdicts are treated the same as unanimous ones, for example they are not taken as a mitigating factor during sentencing.

=== Scotland ===

It is not possible to have a hung jury in Scotland in criminal cases. Juries consist of 15, and verdicts are decided by simple majority (eight) of the initial membership. If jurors drop out because of illness or another reason, the trial can continue with a minimum of 12 jurors, but the support of eight jurors is needed for a guilty verdict; anything less is treated as an acquittal.

In civil cases there is a jury of 12, with a minimum of 10 needed to continue the trial. It is possible to have a hung jury if there is a tied vote after three hours&#x27; deliberation.

==United States==
Majority verdicts are not allowed in civilian criminal cases in the United States. A hung jury results in a mistrial. The case may be retried (&quot;United States v. Perez&quot;, 1824). 

Louisiana, which was historically influenced by the French civil law system, and Oregon used to allow 10–2 majority verdicts. In the 2020 case &quot;Ramos v. Louisiana&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a jury must vote unanimously to convict in any criminal offense that requires a jury trial.

Some jurisdictions permit the court to give the jury a so-called Allen charge, inviting the dissenting jurors to re-examine their opinions, as a last-ditch effort to prevent the jury from hanging. The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure state, &quot;The verdict must be unanimous. ... If there are multiple defendants, the jury may return a verdict at any time during its deliberations as to any defendant about whom it has agreed. ... If the jury cannot agree on all counts as to any defendant, the jury may return a verdict on those counts on which it has agreed. ... If the jury cannot agree on a verdict on one or more counts, the court may declare a mistrial on those counts. A hung jury does not imply either the defendant&#x27;s guilt or innocence. The government may retry any defendant on any count on which the jury could not agree.&quot;

In jurisdictions giving those involved in the case a choice of jury size (such as between a six-person and twelve-person jury), defense counsel in both civil and criminal cases frequently opt for the larger number of jurors. A common axiom in criminal cases is that &quot;it takes only one to hang,&quot; referring to the fact that in some cases, a single juror can defeat the required unanimity.

One proposal for dealing with the difficulties associated with hung juries has been to introduce supermajority verdicts to allow juries to convict defendants without unanimous agreements amongst the jurors. Hence, a 12-member jury that would otherwise be deadlocked at 11 for conviction and one against, would be recorded as a guilty verdict. The rationale for majority verdicts usually includes arguments related to so-called &#x27;rogue jurors&#x27;, who unreasonably impede the course of justice. Opponents of majority verdicts argue that it undermines public confidence in criminal justice systems and results in a higher number of individuals to be convicted of crimes they did not commit.

In United States military justice, there are no hung juries. If the threshold for a conviction is not met, the defendant is acquitted. Article 52 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. Chapter 47) specifies the minimum number of court-martial panel members required to return a verdict of guilty. In a capital case, a unanimous vote of all panel members is required to convict on a capital charge. 

In all other cases, only a three-fourths vote is required to convict. Additionally, the Manual for Courts-Martial requires only a judge and a specified number of panel members in all non-capital cases (eight for a general court-martial or three for a special court-martial; no panel is seated for a summary court-martial). In capital cases, a panel of 12 members is required.

===Hung jury in capital sentencing===
Of the 27 U.S. states with the death penalty, 25 require the sentence to be decided by a jury.

Two states do not use juries in death penalty cases: 
* In Nebraska the sentence is decided by a three-judge panel, which must unanimously agree on death, and the defendant is sentenced to life imprisonment if one of the judges is opposed. 
* Montana is the only state where the trial judge decides the sentence alone. 
Two states do not require a unanimous jury decision:
* In Alabama, at least 10 jurors must concur, and a retrial happens if the jury deadlocks. 
* In Florida, at least 8 jurors (two-thirds) must concur, and the prosecution can pursue a retrial if the jury deadlocks.

In all states in which the jury is involved, only death-qualified prospective jurors can be selected in such a jury, to exclude both people who will always vote for the death sentence and those who are categorically opposed to it. However, the states differ on what happens if the penalty phase results in a hung jury:
* In five states (Alabama, Arizona, California, Kentucky and Nevada), a retrial of the penalty phase will be conducted before a different jury (the common-law rule for mistrial).
* In two states (Indiana and Missouri), the judge will decide the sentence.
* In the remaining states, a hung jury results in a life sentence, even if only one juror opposed death. Federal law also provides that outcome.

The first outcome is referred as the &quot;true unanimity&quot; rule, while the third has been criticized as the &quot;single-juror veto&quot; rule.

<doc id="621244" wikidata="Q5110210" url="?curid=621244" title="Transformational Christianity">
<text>Transformational Christianity, or Transformationalism, represents a fusion of evangelicalism, Pentecostalism, and ecumenism that started becoming prominent in the early 21st century. Unlike previous movements, it is typically embodied in regional &quot;meta-church&quot; organizations—alliances of churches from different denominational backgrounds—rather than particular churches, , or parachurch organizations. Critics of Transformationalism accuse it of overemphasizing eschatology, false dichotomies, unnecessary idealism and a tendency to be corrosive of individual church identities.

== Radical middle ==
Transformational Christianity interprets the gospel from a unified perspective of transforming individuals, relationships, and institutions. It thus tends to align intellectually with evangelicals, emotionally with charismatics, and socially with ecumenicals—though only up to a point. The emphasis is less on being theologically or politically correct than on being effective in transforming the believer and the world around. It thus tends to reflect the kingdom theology of Gordon Fee&#x27;s radical middle approach to Christianity, which characterizes the role of the church as manifesting God&#x27;s kingdom on Earth.

== Defining beliefs ==
Ed Silvoso identifies &quot;Five Pivotal Paradigms&quot; he considers essential for sustainable transformation to take place. Specifically, he calls people to recognize that:
* The Great Commission is about discipling nations, not just people.
* The marketplace (the heart of the nation) has already been redeemed by Jesus and now needs to be reclaimed by His followers.
* Labor is the premier expression of worship on Earth, and every believer is a minister.
* Our primary call is not to build the Church, but to take the kingdom of God where the kingdom of darkness is still entrenched, in order for Jesus to build His Church.
* The premier social indicator that transformation has taken place is the elimination of &quot;systemic&quot; poverty.

== Marketplace ministers ==
One defining aspect of transformationalism is its focus on what are called &quot;marketplace ministers&quot;. In this context, as in many Christian circles, the term &#x27;marketplace&#x27; is used to represent business, education, and government—i.e., everything outside the church and family. The heroes of most other movements are celebrated for their church-related activities (e.g., evangelists, missionaries, bishops, apostles, etc.). In contrast, the heroes of transformationalism are lionized for their work outside the church. Importantly, they are expected to deliver &quot;secular&quot; success (new business, increased profits or efficiency, improved workplace conditions) as a precondition to &quot;spiritual&quot; success (conversions, transformed lifestyles, formal acknowledgement of Christianity, etc.). They are not valued just for making money, or even just for bringing people into the church; rather, they are seen as the primary carriers for bringing the &quot;kingdom of God&quot; or &quot;presence of Jesus Christ&quot; into the world.

In one sense, this is a return to the ideals of the Protestant reformation, with its emphasis on the &quot;priesthood of all believers&quot; and the value of secular work. The key difference is that transformationalism is set in the context of a post-Christian culture, where personal evangelism is both possible and (in this view) necessary. Thus, secular work is also viewed as a platform for evangelization. At the same time, transformationalists would also affirm—and celebrate—the intrinsic value of work, both as an aspect of worship and as a service to society.

== Regional pastoring ==
A related innovation is the concept of citywide pastoring. The key premise is that in addition to the concepts of one &quot;church universal&quot; and many &quot;local congregations,&quot; which most Christians accept, there is also a third level: &quot;the church in the city&quot;. The idea is that all the congregations in a particular region, of whatever denomination, are really aspects of a single church family, and should actively think, plan, and work together under that common framework. This does not mean that a single unifying structure is imposed from above, as in the old establishment idea of parishes. Rather, it involves formalizing the existing networks of relationship and trust into a coherent organizational structure, usually involving councils of recognized leaders from different communities. This typically means the church as a whole develops a common vision, which is implemented by individual congregations with minimal explicit coordination. It also enables the Christian community to speak with one voice when dealing with local government; however, the focus is usually on finding ways to cooperate in serving the community, rather than dictating policy.

== History ==

The concept of transformation was initiated as a result of claims regarding an apparent series of citywide revivals which took place in several South American locations in the 1990s. These claims were widely promoted in videos produced by George Otis, Jr. under the title, &quot;Transformations&quot; (2000) and &quot;Transformations II&quot; (2002). They are still as of January 2025, being sold from Otis&#x27; Sentinel Group website store. These films claim drug arrests (see Cali Cartel) were connected to revival in the Colombian city as well as purported reports of giant vegetables grown in Guatemala, community transformation in the Canadian Arctic, Ugandan revival and dramatic increases in church attendance. Jack Dennison also wrote a book, &quot;City Reaching.&quot; This provided further impetus within the fundamentalist Christian world to Otis&#x27; teaching in both city reaching and marketplace ministry techniques. Argentinian evangelist Ed Silvoso popularized the latter approach in his book &quot;Anointed for Business&quot;, which introduced the term &quot;Marketplace Transformation&quot;. This combined with the concept of &quot;community transformation&quot; to develop a more general focus on transformation.

The term &quot;Transformationalism&quot; was apparently first used in conjunction with groups such as Pray the Bay in early 2004, reflecting a more general view of transformation as a key (if not defining) attribute of the Christian life. This coincided with a possibly unrelated increase in the use of the term &#x27;transformation&#x27; by a wide range of different churches and organizations during 2004.

Transformation conferences in 2005 (Indonesia) and 2007 (Seoul, Korea) focused on five &quot;streams&quot;: saturation church planting; revival; reaching cities; marketplace ministry and economic development for the poor. The goal was, among other things, to develop a transformational covenant, to provide further definition to this movement.

The claims made by Otis in the &quot;Transformations&quot; videos have been unable to be verified when investigated by neutral researchers, journalists and his critics. His concept has strong influences from the New Apostolic Reformation and utilized strategic-level spiritual warfare as a key strategy. The &quot;Transformations&quot; videos circulated widely through Pentecostal, charismatic and similar spirit-filled Christian churches all over the world. Copies of the videos (and later DVDs) and other associated books and commercial merchandise generated huge personal and corporate profits for various Christian leaders and religious organizations through on-selling in churches. The videos had a significant impact in the conservative Australian city of Toowoomba, where large numbers of fundamentalist and Pentecostal Christians became convinced of the power of strategic level spiritual warfare to bring about a revival and transformation there. Astonishing claims were made, sometimes through so-called prophecies, that this action would lead to Toowoomba becoming a hub for the anticipated great Australian revival, as well as the achievement of reduced sinfulness, a lower crime rate, general prosperity among the population, greatly increased church attendance, the installation of men and women of God into government and a reduced commitment to cults. These predictions failed to materialize (and in fact there is strong evidence the opposite has occurred), and have provided further evidence for critics of the ease with which the spirit-filled Christian community can become prone to fads and cleverly packaged marketing, similar to what occurred in churches through the Y2K panic and &quot;The Prayer of Jabez&quot;.

== Comparisons ==
Transformationalism can be considered a more secular version of the Manifest Sons of God doctrine that emerged from the Latter Rain Movement. It is also similar to the revivalism of traditional Evangelicalism. However, by shifting the focus from individual conversion to large-scale transformation, it adopts an approach not unlike the social gospel that characterized the progressive or liberal Evangelicalism of the pre-war period (this is in contrast to the more confrontational approach of fundamentalism). Unlike the Christian Right, transformationalists emphasize that the way to achieve a renewed society is through personal testimony and servant-leadership towards those in power, rather than political maneuvering. This places it near to &quot;progressive evangelicalism.&quot; Some aspects are reminiscent of the Dutch Neo-Calvinists, Abraham Kuyper and Herman Dooyeweerd, especially talk of &quot;filling up the spheres of society.&quot;

Transformational groups typically involve a cross-section of Protestant, Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and non-denominational churches and parachurch organizations (though not borderline groups, such as Mormons). Most still tend to have an evangelical, or even fundamentalist, statement of faith; however, they are generally more concerned with being inclusive than exclusive, and often will attempt to accommodate individuals and churches with more liberal theological views if they share a compatible vision of the goals and means of transformation. Transformational movements are often mediated by other trans-denominational initiatives such as the Alpha Course or Promise Keepers, which share a similar heritage and goals.

Transformational Christianity is one attempt to aid evangelicals in what &quot;Christianity Today&quot; calls &quot;a paradigm shift—in their understanding of conversion and redemption&quot;.

<text>The 1945 Canadian federal election was held on June 11, 1945, to elect members of the House of Commons of the 20th Parliament of Canada. Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s Liberals won a third term. The party fell five seats short of a majority but was able to rule as a majority government with the support of Independent Liberal MPs.

Since 1939, Canada had been fighting in World War II. In May 1945, the war in Europe ended, allowing King to call an election. As the war in Asia was still raging on, King promised a voluntary force to fight in Operation Downfall, the planned invasion of Japan, while Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) leader John Bracken promised conscription, which was an unpopular proposal and led to the PCs&#x27; third consecutive defeat. The Liberals were also re-elected because of their promise to expand welfare programs. However, they also lost about a third of their seats; this stark decline in support was partly attributed to their introduction of conscription in 1944 (which was unpopular in Quebec, paving the rise of the Bloc Populaire) as well as the breakthrough of the democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), which campaigned on an even bigger expansion of the welfare state than the Liberals. The Social Credit Party made modest gains.

Although the election officially resulted in a minority government, the election of eight &quot;Independent Liberal&quot; MPs, most of whom did not run as official Liberals because of their opposition to conscription, gave the King government an effective working majority in parliament. Most of the Independent Liberal MPs joined (or re-joined) the Liberal caucus following World War II when the conscription issue became moot. As King was defeated in his own riding of Prince Albert, fellow Liberal William MacDiarmid, who was re-elected in the safe seat of Glengarry, resigned so that a by-election could be held, which was subsequently won by King.

==Background==

In the 1935 election, the Liberal Party led by William Lyon Mackenzie King returned to power (King&#x27;s Liberals had previously governed Canada from 1921 to 1930) with a landslide majority government. The King government&#x27;s success in combatting the Great Depression led to their second landslide majority victory in the 1940 election. From 1939 to 1945, the King government&#x27;s main priority was aiding the Allies in World War II.

In the period leading up to the election, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was rising in popularity. A Gallup poll from September 1943 showed the CCF with a one-point lead over both the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. Many predicted a major breakthrough for the CCF nationally and the party was expected to win 70 to 100 seats, possibly even enough to form a minority government. In the Saskatchewan provincial election, the CCF won a landslide victory, forming a provincial government for the first time.

In 1942, members of the Conservative Party held the Port Hope Conference, which established several Conservative goals including support for free enterprise and conscription, and more radical policies such as full-employment, low-cost housing, trade union rights, as well as a whole range of social security measures, including a government financed medicare system. Progressive Party Premier of Manitoba John Bracken became the Conservative Party&#x27;s leader that same year, and changed the party&#x27;s name to the Progressive Conservative Party as a result of this policy shift.

==Campaign==

===Liberals===

A key issue in this election seems to have been electing a stable government. The Liberals urged voters to &quot;Return the Mackenzie King Government&quot;, and argued that only the Liberal Party had a &quot;preponderance of members in all nine provinces&quot;. Mackenzie King threatened to call a new election if he was not given a majority: &quot;We would have confusion to deal with at a time when the world will be in a very disturbed situation. The war in Europe is over, but unrest in the east is not over.&quot;

Social welfare programs were also an issue in the campaign. Another Liberal slogan encouraged voters to &quot;Build a New Social Order&quot; by endorsing the Liberal platform, which included
* $750 million to provide land, jobs and business support for veterans;
* $400 million of public spending to build housing;
* $250 million for family allowances;
* establishing an Industrial development Bank;
* loans to farmers, floor prices for agricultural products;
* tax reductions.

===Progressive Conservatives===

The Progressive Conservatives tried to capitalize on the massive mid-campaign victory by the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in the 1945 Ontario provincial election. PC campaign ads exhorted voters to rally behind their party: &quot;Ontario shows! Only Bracken can win!&quot;, and suggesting that it would be impossible to form a majority government in the country without a plurality of seats in Ontario, which only the Tories could win.

Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan, was scheduled for late 1945-early 1946. Bracken had promised conscription for the invasion of Japan whereas King had promised to commit one division of volunteers to the planned invasion of Japan. Based on the way that the Japanese had fought the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa it was widely expected that the invasion of the Japanese home islands would be a bloody campaign, and Bracken&#x27;s promise of conscription for the planned invasion of Japan did much to turn voters against his party.

Despite the party&#x27;s performance ultimately being their best since R.B. Bennett&#x27;s government was ousted in a landslide a decade previously, Bracken was widely held responsible for their failure to make a better showing – aside from the conscription issue, many believed that his western populism was a futile approach, and that the Tories could not hope to compete with the CCF and Socreds in the west – and the party grandees immediately began pressuring him to resign in favour of George A. Drew, who had led the Ontario Progressive Conservatives to their provincial election victory; Bracken would eventually do so in 1948.

===Co-operative Commonwealth Federation===

Campaigning under the slogan, &quot;Work, Security, and Freedom for All – with the CCF&quot;, the CCF promised to retain war-time taxes on high incomes and excess profits in order to fund social services, and to abolish the Senate of Canada. The CCF fought hard to prevent the support of labour from going to the Labor-Progressive Party (i.e., the Communist Party of Canada).

The LPP, for its part, pointed out that the CCF&#x27;s refusal to enter into an electoral pact with the LPP had cost the CCF 100,000 votes in the Ontario election, and had given victory to the Ontario PCs. It urged voters to &quot;Make Labour a Partner in Government.&quot;

===Social Credit===

The Social Credit Party of Canada tried, with modest success, to capitalize on the positive image of the Alberta Socred government of William Aberhart, asking voters, &quot;Good Government in Alberta -- Why Not at Ottawa?&quot;. Referring to social credit monetary theories, the party encouraged voters to &quot;Vote for the National Dividend&quot;.

<text>Lucienne Robillard (born June 16, 1945) is a Canadian politician and a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. She sat in the House of Commons of Canada as the member of Parliament for the riding of Westmount—Ville-Marie in Montreal, Quebec.

Robillard had a career as a social worker before entering politics. In the Quebec election of 1989, she was elected to the National Assembly of Quebec in the riding of Chambly as a member of the Quebec Liberal Party. She was appointed to the provincial cabinet of Premier Robert Bourassa as Minister of Cultural Affairs. In 1992, she became Minister of Education, and then served as Minister of Health and Social Services from 1994 until the defeat of the Liberal government.

She then moved to federal politics as a star candidate when she was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a by-election in the safe Liberal riding of Westmount—Ville-Marie. Jean Chrétien appointed her to the federal cabinet as Minister of Labour and Minister responsible for the federal campaign in the 1995 Quebec referendum.

In 1996, she became Minister of Citizenship and Immigration. On August 3, 1999, she assumed the responsibilities of President of the Treasury Board.

When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada in 2003, he moved Robillard to the position of Minister of Industry and Minister of the Economic Development Agency of Canada for the Regions of Quebec. With the cabinet shuffle that followed the 2004 election, she became Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs and President of the Queen&#x27;s Privy Council for Canada.

Upon Judy Sgro&#x27;s resignation from Cabinet on January 14, 2005, Joe Volpe moved to fill the vacant position of Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and Robillard assumed his prior responsibilities as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development. When Belinda Stronach crossed the floor and joined the Liberals in the House of Commons on May 17, 2005, she replaced Robillard as Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development.

On February 1, 2006, she was named deputy leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons by Interim Leader Bill Graham. She held this post until the newly elected leader, Stéphane Dion (who represents the nearby riding of Saint-Laurent—Cartierville), in accordance with the customary Anglophone/Francophone division of duties, appointed the Anglophone Michael Ignatieff as his deputy.

On April 4, 2007, she announced she would not run in the next election. She resigned her seat on January 25, 2008.

In 2010 she became co-chair of the election campaign for the Liberal Party of Canada in Quebec. In May 2010 she was elected President of the Liberal Party of Canada (Quebec) (LPCQ) by the Board of directors to replace Marc Lavigne who had resigned for personal reasons a few months after having been elected by the delegates at the October 2009 convention. Lucienne Robillard was also co-chair of the Electoral Commission of the LPCQ in 2010 and 2011 until the commission was dissolved at the start of the 2011 electoral campaign.

As president of the LPCQ she also sits on the National Board of Directors of the Liberal Party of Canada.

<doc id="621261" wikidata="Q713683" url="?curid=621261" title="Stephen Lee (snooker player)">
<text>Stephen Lee (born 12 October 1974) is an English former professional snooker player. He turned professional in 1992, reached a career-high of fifth in the snooker world rankings for the 2000–01 season, and won five ranking titles. His best performances in Triple Crown events were reaching the semi-finals of the 2003 World Championship, where he lost to eventual champion Mark Williams, and reaching the final of the 2008 Masters, where he was runner-up to Mark Selby. He compiled 184 century breaks in professional competition and was noted for his smooth cue action.

West Midlands police arrested Lee in February 2010 as part of an investigation into suspicious betting patterns at the 2009 UK Championship, but no further action was taken against him at that time. Following further reports of irregular betting patterns on a 2012 Premier League match between Lee and John Higgins on 11 October 2012, the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) suspended Lee the next day and subsequently brought match-fixing charges against him. After an independent tribunal found Lee guilty of influencing the outcome of seven matches in 2008 and 2009, he was banned from competing in or attending any WPBSA-affiliated tournament for 12 years, backdated to the beginning of his suspension. This was the longest ban handed down in the sport until Liang Wenbo and Li Hang received lifetime bans in 2023. Lee appealed the decision, but was dismissed in May 2014, meaning that his ban remained in force until 12 October 2024, also the date of his 50th birthday. Lee was ordered to pay the WPBSA £125,000 in costs relating to his hearing and appeal, but has not yet done so.

==Career==

===Early career===
Lee turned professional after winning the English Amateur Championship in 1992. During his first season as a professional he had a run of 33 successive frames won during qualifying matches, an all-time professional record. He reached the Top 16 of the rankings five years later, despite never having reached the semi-finals of a ranking event at this point. He entered the Top 8 after winning his first ranking title during the 1998–99 season.

===1998–2011===
His first ranking victory came at the Grand Prix, in 1998 defeating Dave Harold 6–4 in a hard-fought semi-final that saw Lee come from 3–0 and 4–1 down, before beating newcomer Marco Fu convincingly in the final, 9–2. His first ranking title and first two ranking semi-finals were all achieved without beating a top-16 player. After a failed drugs test in 2000 briefly upset his momentum, he scored more ranking points than any other player in the 2001–02 season (winning the Scottish Open as well as the Grand Prix), thus briefly making him the provisional world No. 1 early in the following season. Lee was favourite to win the 2001 Masters, but lost 5–6 in the first round to John Parrott. He was part of the England team which won the 2001 Nations Cup. His best run in the World Championship came in the 2003 event when he reached the semi-finals.

Due to a dip in form, at the 2006 Welsh Open he came to the competition outside the provisional Top 16 after failing to win a ranking tournament for four years. He went on to win the tournament, beating the then World Champion, Shaun Murphy, 9–4 in the final.

For 2007–08 he slipped to No. 13 in the rankings after reaching just one semi-final, partly due to missing the China Open for personal reasons. He nevertheless reached the final of the 2008 Masters, losing 3–10 to Mark Selby. Following a heavy defeat by Joe Swail in the first round of the 2008 World Championship, confirming his drop out of the top 16 of the rankings, Lee considered retiring from the game.

However, he did compete in the first ranking event of the 2008–09 season, the 2008 Northern Ireland Trophy, and after convincing wins over Judd Trump and Stephen Hendry, he reached the last 16, where despite making three century breaks he lost 4–5 to eventual runner-up Dave Harold. He then failed to qualify for the Shanghai Masters, losing 4–5 to Tom Ford. He reached the televised stages of the 2009 World Championship by defeating Judd Trump in qualifying, but was beaten 10–4 in the first round by Ryan Day.

On 11 February 2010 Lee was arrested by West Midlands Police on suspicion of cheating, in relation to an investigation by the Gambling Commission over suspicious betting patterns.

During the 2010–11 season Lee managed to regain some form including a win in Event 4 of the EPTC events. However, he drew John Higgins in the first round at both the 2010 UK Championship and World Championship, losing on both occasions with Higgins going on to eventually win both events. At the China Open he drew Mark Williams in the first round and despite Williams making four centuries he won 5–4, making a gutsy 61 clearance to the black in the decider. He went on to reach the quarter-finals, where he lost to Ding Junhui 5–2. Lee won a non-ranking event in 2011 in the CCI Open Invitational he beat Jimmy White 10–7 in the final in Mumbai.

=== Return to form ===

Lee began the 2011–12 season ranked 18 and lost in qualifying for the Australian Goldfields Open and in the first round of the Shanghai Masters. However, he had an excellent run of form in the PTC Events by reaching the quarter-finals of Events 3 and 4 and going one better in Event 6, as he lost to Neil Robertson in the last 4. This meant that Lee returned to the top 16 in October, as he was ranked 13 and therefore gained automatic entry into the upcoming ranking events. He lost in the first round of the 2011 UK Championship and in the German Masters reached his first semi-final since the 2006 Northern Ireland Trophy, but could not get past Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan, who won 6–4. He then made it to the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, where he was put off by a mobile phone ringing on his back-swing in a deciding frame against Ding Junhui and went on to lose the match. He used his frustration from the incident to good effect however, as he beat Dominic Dale, Neil Robertson, Graeme Dott and Robert Milkins to reach the final of the World Open, his first since the 2006 Welsh Open. He played Mark Allen, but was dominated throughout, as he lost the match 1–10.

Lee enjoyed further success on the PTC calendar as he reached another semi-final, to finish 14th on the Order of Merit and therefore qualified for the last 24 of the Finals. It was in the finals where Lee won his first ranking title for six years as he dropped just three frames during the tournament, including 4–0 whitewashes over Mark Selby and in the final versus Robertson, where Lee became the first player to beat the Australian in a ranking event final. Lee&#x27;s form in the second half of the season continued into the China Open as he registered his third ranking event semi-final of the year by defeating Judd Trump again, but could not feature in three successive finals as he lost 2–6 to Stephen Maguire. His season did finish in disappointment though as he was beaten in the first round of the World Championship 6–10 by Andrew Higginson. Nevertheless, Lee climbed 10 places in the world rankings to end the season at number 8, the highest he has been since 2003.

==Match-fixing and ban==
Lee was arrested and bailed on suspicion of match-fixing on 11 February 2010. This followed a police investigation into suspicious betting patterns relating to a match played in 2009, believed to have taken place at the 2009 UK Championship. On 2 October 2012, the WPBSA released a statement confirming that the Crown Prosecution Service would not be taking further action against Lee over the claims. Nine days after the statement was issued, Lee was involved in another controversial match on 11 October which resulted in a 2–4 defeat by John Higgins at a Premier League fixture after Lee had been leading the match 2–1, which caused fellow professional Judd Trump to question the integrity of the result on Twitter, especially since Lee squandered a golden opportunity to level the match at 3 frames all. The following day—on his 38th birthday—Lee was suspended by the WPBSA following reports by at least two bookmakers of irregular betting patterns connected to the Premier League match, pending a full inquiry. Lee appealed against the decision made by the Chairman of the WPBSA; Robert Englehart QC—appointed by Sport Resolutions UK to consider Lee&#x27;s appeal against suspension—dismissed it, deciding the suspension should remain in place until either the conclusion of the investigation or any resultant hearings.

On 14 February 2013, the WPBSA brought charges against Lee concerning his group matches at the 2008 Malta Cup, two matches at the 2008 UK Championship, his match at the 2009 China Open, and a match at the 2009 World Snooker Championship. He was charged with violating sections 2.8 and 2.9 of the Members Rules and Regulations, which concern divulging information not already in the public domain with the express purpose of it being used for match-betting, and entering into an arrangement to influence the result of a game. Lee applied for permission to play in the 2013 World Championship in the event that the proceedings against him would be brought to a close before the draw was made, but it later transpired that he would be unable to participate in the tournament after learning that his hearing would not take place before the qualifying draw. On 10 April, the WPBSA announced that they would no longer be proceeding with the investigation into the Premier League match, although the inquiry into the remaining match-fixing charges would still go ahead. While suspended from WSA tournaments, Lee continued to compete in independently organised events, winning the RKGKhar Gymkhana Snooker Masters in May.

The case was heard by independent tribunal, Sport Resolutions UK, in a three-day hearing chaired by Adam Lewis QC, starting on 9 September 2013. The verdict was delivered on 16 September, with Lee found guilty of influencing the outcome of seven matches in 2008 and 2009. On 25 September, he received a twelve-year ban from WSA events, backdated to the beginning of his suspension on 12 October 2012, running through to his 50th birthday on 12 October 2024, and ordered to pay £40,000 in costs. Up until then it was the longest ban ever imposed in the sport until the lifetime bans given to Liang Wenbo and Li Hang in 2023. Lee subsequently appealed against the &quot;finding of the tribunal, the sanction and the costs awarded&quot;. Sport Resolutions appointed Edwin Glasgow QC to chair the appeal, with the Appeals Committee determining that the appeal should be heard in two parts. Originally set for 30 January 2014, the appeal was adjourned to 17 February. In the first stage of his appeal Lee challenged the independence of Adam Lewis, chairman of the original tribunal. Lewis had previously represented Leyton Orient F.C.—owned by World Snooker&#x27;s CEO, Barry Hearn—in a legal dispute, and Lee&#x27;s legal team argued there was a conflict of interest. The argument was rejected on 25 February, and he was ordered to pay a further £30,000 in costs. The appeals panel recused itself from the second part of the appeal—in which Lee would challenge the guilty verdict itself—after finding him to be an unreliable witness. On 15 May, with Nicholas Stewart QC presiding, the remainder of the appeal was dismissed and the costs awarded against Lee at the Adam Lewis hearing were increased from £40,000 to £75,000. Stewart also awarded further costs of £20,000 against Lee for the second part of his appeal, bringing the total costs awarded against him to £125,000. Lee has never discharged these legal costs. He was removed from the snooker tour and world rankings in June 2014.

==Personal life==
Lee married his long-term partner Laura in 2005. He has four children, including twin sons. His son Alfie Lee has become a noted amateur snooker player. When playing on the professional tour, he was noted for his unusually high weight.

In September 2015, Lee was featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out West&quot; documentary series, which revealed that he had established the Stephen Lee Billiards Academy, a snooker coaching club for children and young people, in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.

===Criminal convictions===
Since leaving the professional game, Lee has had several run-ins with the law. On 9 June 2014 Lee pleaded guilty to fraud at Swindon Magistrates&#x27; Court and was fined £110. Lee had sold his personal snooker cue to a Facebook fan for £1,600 but when he failed to deliver the cue the fan reported the matter to the police. Lee was also ordered to repay the £1,600 cost of the cue.

On 12 April 2018 Lee was arrested in Hong Kong following an immigration raid at a billiards hall. Lee was charged with teaching snooker without a work permit and appeared in court on 14 April where he pleaded not guilty to breaching the conditions of his tourist visa. Lee was forced to surrender his passport and was bailed until June. Lee changed his plea to a guilty plea on the first day of his trial, and the case was dismissed after he agreed to a 12-month good behaviour bond of HK$1,000 (£95).

<doc id="621262" wikidata="Q295478" url="?curid=621262" title="Guillermo Coria">
<text>Guillermo Sebastián Coria (born 13 January 1982), nicknamed &quot;El Mago&quot; (&quot;The Magician&quot; in Spanish), is an Argentine former professional tennis player. He reached a career-high ATP world No. 3 singles ranking in May 2004. Coria achieved his best results on clay, where he won eight of his nine ATP singles titles, and during his prime years in 2003 and 2004 was considered &quot;the world&#x27;s best clay-court player.&quot; He reached the final of the 2004 French Open, where he was defeated by Gastón Gaudio despite serving for the match twice and being up two sets to love. In later years, injuries and a lack of confidence affected his game, and he retired in 2009 at the age of 27. Between 2001 and 2002, he served a seven-month suspension for taking the banned substance nandrolone.

==Career==
Coria turned professional in 2000, finishing 2003, 2004, and 2005 as a top-ten player. He was one of the fastest players on the ATP Tour, consistently showing exceptional performances in clay-court tournaments. His playing style was that of a counter-puncher.

He was considered the &quot;King of Clay&quot; between 2003 and 2005 by reaching 6 out of 8 possible Masters finals (since he was absent for 2004 Rome Masters) on clay during that period. While at the French Open, he also reached semifinals in 2003 and held two match points in the final in 2004.

===Junior===
As a junior, Coria reached a ranking of world No. 2 in singles and world No. 5 in doubles.

Coria won the Orange Bowl 16s in 1997 and reached the finals of Orange Bowl 18s in 1998, where he was defeated by future world No. 1 Roger Federer. Coria won the boys&#x27; singles title at the 1999 French Open without dropping a single set, beating his friend and fellow Argentine, David Nalbandian in straight sets in the final. One month later, at the 1999 Wimbledon Championships, in singles as the third seed, Coria reached semifinals without dropping a set, where he was defeated by top seed Kristian Pless in straight sets. In doubles of the same tournament, however, as first seeds, Coria and Nalbandian teamed up to win the boys&#x27; doubles title by beating Todor Enev and Jarkko Nieminen.

=== Early career: failed drugs test and doping suspension ===
Coria tested positive for nandrolone in April 2001 after a match in Barcelona against Michel Kratochvil. Coria was initially banned from tennis for two years, starting in August 2001, and was fined $98,565. Coria claimed that the only supplement that he was taking was a multivitamin made by a New Jersey supplements company. His family employed a private lab to test the multivitamin, which was found to be contaminated with steroids. In December 2001, the ATP refused to acquit Coria but reduced his ban from two years to seven months, which meant that he would be free to continue with his tennis career in March 2002. Coria sued the New Jersey supplements company for more than $10 million in lost prize money and endorsements and settled after the third day of the trial for an undisclosed amount.

As a result of the seven months during which Coria was banned from playing tennis, his world ranking dropped from No. 32 to No. 97. 2002 was, therefore, a rebuilding year for Coria, and he finished 2002 ranked at world No. 45.

===2003–2005: &quot;King of Clay&quot;===
====2003: Dominance on clay begins====
Coria signaled his arrival as a world-class clay-court player in 2003 by reaching the finals in Buenos Aires, where he lost a tight best-of-three-sets match to Carlos Moyá, and at the Monte Carlo Masters, where he lost in two straight sets to Juan Carlos Ferrero. Coria went on to win his first Masters Series title at Hamburg by defeating Agustín Calleri in the final in three straight sets.

At the French Open, Coria defeated Andre Agassi in four sets in the quarterfinals, before suffering an upset loss to Martin Verkerk and his booming serves in the semifinals. In July, Coria was increasingly establishing himself as the new king of clay by winning three clay-court tournaments in three weeks, the Mercedes Cup in Stuttgart, the Generali Open in Kitzbühel and the Orange Prokom Open in Sopot. He won these three tournaments without dropping a set, dishing out five bagels and eight breadsticks in the process. He finished the year ranked No. 5 in the world.

====2004: French Open final====
In 2004, Coria won the clay-court tournament in Buenos Aires and reached his first Masters final on hard court at the NASDAQ-100 Open, where he faced Andy Roddick. From the first set onwards, Coria was visibly hurt by pains in his back that later turned out to be kidney stones. Coria still won the first set 7–6, but Roddick won the next two sets 6–3, 6–1, before Coria was forced to retire during the first game of the fourth set.

Three weeks later, Coria defeated Rainer Schüttler in three straight sets in the final of the Monte Carlo Masters to win his second Masters Series title. Coria had now won five consecutive clay-court tournaments which include two consecutive Masters Series titles and had gone 26 consecutive matches unbeaten on clay. On 3 May 2004, Coria reached a career-high ranking of world No. 3. In attempting to defend his title at the Hamburg Masters, Coria increased his clay-court winning streak to 31 matches by reaching the final, where he lost to world No. 1, Roger Federer, in four sets.

At the French Open, Coria only dropped one set en route to the final, defeating Nikolay Davydenko, Juan Mónaco, Mario Ančić and Nicolas Escudé, before beating former world No. 1, Carlos Moyá, in the quarterfinals and British serve-and-volleyer, Tim Henman, in the semifinals; but he was unexpectedly defeated by unseeded compatriot Gastón Gaudio in an unprecedented all-Argentine final, 6–0, 6–3, 4–6, 1–6, 6–8. Coria had won the first two sets with ease and was in control of the third set at 4–4 and 40–0 up on serve, before Gaudio broke Coria&#x27;s serve and went on to take the third set. Coria then succumbed to leg cramps for the rest of the match and was barely able to move at times, with many of his serves in the fourth set not even reaching the net. Despite this, Coria still got the advantage at several stages of the fifth set, leading by a break of serve on four separate occasions, including twice serving for the championship at 5–4 and 6–5. He had two championship points at 6–5 but he narrowly missed the line with attempted winners on both points, making him the only male player in the Open Era to lose a Grand Slam singles final after having held a championship point, until Roger Federer did so too at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships. Many fans and pundits agree that Coria was never the same player after the loss.

Coria reached finals on three different surfaces (all except carpet) in 2004. He surprised some people by reaching the first grass-court final of his career at &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch, losing the final to Michaël Llodra. This was only two weeks after the devastation of losing the French Open final. Coria then went on to defeat Wesley Moodie in a five-set match in the first round of Wimbledon, which took nearly three days to complete after the start of the match, as a result of rain and poor scheduling. Coria lost in four sets in the second round to Florian Mayer and got a bad injury to his right shoulder during the match. As a result, Coria dropped out for the remainder of the season and in August, Coria had surgery on his right shoulder. He returned to the ATP Tour in November for the Masters Cup, where he performed poorly.

====2005: Two Masters finals on clay &amp; service yips====
Coria appeared in five finals after the 2004 French Open defeat and lost four of them, with three of them against the rising king of clay, Rafael Nadal. The most famous one is the Rome Masters final loss that lasted almost 5 hours and 20 minutes. It is agreed by many that it is one of the greatest matches played on clay, if not the greatest of all. Their head-to-head record was deadlocked at 1–1 prior to the match, with Nadal winning their most recent meeting at the Monte-Carlo Masters final weeks ago in four sets. Nadal took the first set 6–4 after being down a break and Coria went on to take the second 6–3. During the third set, Coria fought back from 1–5 to 3–5, where the game progressed to one of the most exciting deuces in tennis that lasted 15 minutes, featuring a variety of tactics and plays in long breathtaking rallies, although eventually Nadal pulled through and went on to take the third set 6–3. Coria took the fourth set 6–4 and led 3–0 in the fifth set with two breaks of serve and had a game point in the fourth game before Nadal broke back twice to lead 4–3 on serve in the fifth set. Eventually, the match went into tiebreak at the five-hour mark, soon after Coria had saved a championship point for Nadal in the 12th game of the fifth set. During the tiebreak, Coria fought back from a 1–5 deficit and saved another two Nadal championship points when 4–6 down in the tiebreak to level at 6–6. However, Nadal then won the next two points to win the fifth set tiebreak 8–6. As a result, Nadal had won his second consecutive Masters final of the year against Coria.

The only final Coria won in 2005 was on 31 July, when he won in Umag, Croatia, defeating Carlos Moyá in the final. Afterward, Coria joked that the small tournament was considered a fifth Grand Slam in his family because his wife Carla hails from Croatia. Coria had a surprisingly consistent 2005 season, where he was one of only three players to reach the fourth round or better at every Grand Slam, the others being Roger Federer and David Nalbandian.

Despite having a consistent season in 2005, during his tournament victory in Umag he started to suffer from the service yips, a psychological condition that renders a tennis player unable to hit the ball at the correct moment when serving. Initially, it was not very noticeable, but became more apparent at the US Open, during which Coria served a combined total of 34 double faults in his fourth-round win over Nicolás Massú and his quarterfinal loss to unseeded Robby Ginepri. Against Ginepri, having already saved five match points, Coria was serving to take the match into a fifth-set tiebreaker, when two consecutive double faults from deuce gave Ginepri the win.

As the 2005 season drew to a close, Coria&#x27;s form started to dip alarmingly as a result of the high number of double faults he was serving in an increasing number of his matches. Coria lost nine of his last eleven matches of 2005. Some pundits have also speculated that his three losses in finals to the emerging Nadal may have hit his confidence worse than the loss to Gaudio.

Between 2003 and 2005, Coria compiled a record of 90–13 (87.38%) which includes a 31-match win streak on clay.

===2006–2009: Steady decline===
====2006: Gradual loss of form====
Coria&#x27;s service yips got increasingly worse in 2006, although he still reached the third round of the Australian Open, and even managed a victory over Novak Djokovic at the Miami Masters without serving any double faults.

At the Monte-Carlo Masters, Coria came back from 1–6, 1–5 down to defeat Paul-Henri Mathieu, despite serving 20 double faults in the match. Coria then defeated Nicolas Kiefer, despite serving 22 double faults, but he was then easily beaten by Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals. After Monte Carlo, Coria wins generally became fewer and further between, although he did manage a semifinal in Amersfoort in July 2006.

Coria withdrew from the French Open and Wimbledon as he attempted to sort out marital problems, problems with his game, and an elbow injury. In August 2006, he hired Horacio de la Peña as his tennis coach. At the US Open, Coria retired in his first-round match against Ryan Sweeting after just five games. It would be 17 months before Coria played a match on the ATP Tour again.

====2007: Injuries and inactivity====
Coria made his return to a Challenger in Belo Horizonte, Brazil on 22 October 2007. He lost the first set 3–6 to fellow Argentine Juan Pablo Brzezicki and subsequently retired with a back injury. He had been leading in the first set 3–1.

====2008: Attempted comeback====
Coria finally returned to the main tour in the Movistar Open in Chile on 28 January 2008. He showed positive signs of recovering his form but was still defeated in the first round by Pablo Cuevas, 4–6, 6–3, 3–6.

In February, in his second ATP Tour appearance of the year, Coria defeated Italian qualifier Francesco Aldi, 6–4, 7–5. It was his first ATP victory in 19 months.

As a result of Andy Roddick&#x27;s withdrawal from the French Open due to a back injury, Coria made his first Grand Slam appearance since the 2006 US Open, taking the place of the American. He faced Tommy Robredo, the three-time quarterfinalist and 12th seed, in the first round. Coria was defeated in four sets, 7–5, 4–6, 1–6, 4–6, but Coria&#x27;s performance led to some optimism, even from Coria himself, who was close to forcing a fifth set.

Coria never recovered from the service yips that damaged his game and kept his ranking hundreds of places below his once consistent top-ten position. On 28 April 2009, he announced his retirement from professional tennis, saying that he &quot;didn’t feel like competing anymore.&quot;

==Playing style==
Coria was a very well-rounded player who had an excellent technique. He was known as a very solid baseliner and an excellent clay-courter. He had excellent speed, making him one of the best defenders on the tour, and he was able to hit good shots on the run. He had penetrating and balanced groundstroke capabilities and frequently utilised drop shots. His comparatively weak serve was especially noted during the late stages of his career, where Coria would make numerous double faults due to service yips, often resorting to hitting a severely underpowered second serve to avoid this. Whilst his small size and relative lack of power meant he did not have any big, stand-out weapons, Coria had excellent consistency and court craft which enabled him to become a top player, especially on clay courts.

Coria also has one of the strongest, if not the best return game in the history of men&#x27;s tennis, currently ranked No. 1 for three of the four all-time leaderboards regarding returns on all surfaces: for breakpoint conversion percentage at 45.71%, ahead of Rafael Nadal (45.15%), and Sergi Bruguera (44.95%); for first-serve return points won percentage at 36.05%, ahead of Nadal (34.05%), and David Ferrer (33.65%); for return games won percentage at 35.26%, ahead of Nadal (33.35%) and Novak Djokovic (32.23%). His incredibly strong return game was sometimes enough to allow him to win matches despite his service yips. The only leaderboard about return that Coria did not rank No. 1 at is the second serve return points won, where he is currently ranked 13th.

==Personal life==
Coria was named after French Open champion and compatriot Guillermo Vilas. He began to play tennis at the age of three, not long after learning how to walk, when his father Oscar, a tennis coach, introduced the game to him. His mother Graciela is a housewife. He was the oldest of three brothers in his family.

Coria attended preschool with David Nalbandian in Argentina (their ages are 12 days apart). He admired Andre Agassi and Marcelo Ríos while growing up. He enjoys playing soccer and he is a well-known River Plate fan. Coria married Carla Francovigh on 27 December 2003. They have a son named Thiago, born on 12 April 2012. A daughter, Delfina, was born on 4 October 2013.

As of 2010, Coria was coaching his younger brother Federico Coria.

As of 2016, Coria has been traveling around Argentina managing the government-funded program &quot;Our Tennis&quot; whose purpose is to promote the sport, and identify and develop talent among children and teens.

==Equipment==
Coria used the Prince O3 Tour. His racquet was strung with Luxilon Big Banger Original 16 String. His clothing sponsor was Adidas.

<doc id="621267" wikidata="Q637545" url="?curid=621267" title="Gluteus maximus">
<text>The gluteus maximus is the main extensor muscle of the hip in humans. It is the largest and outermost of the three gluteal muscles and makes up a large part of the shape and appearance of each side of the hips. It is the single largest muscle in the human body. Its thick fleshy mass, in a quadrilateral shape, forms the prominence of the buttocks. The other gluteal muscles are the medius and minimus, and sometimes informally these are collectively referred to as the glutes.

Its large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular system in humans, connected as it is with the power of maintaining the trunk in the erect posture. Other primates have much flatter hips and cannot sustain standing erectly.

The muscle is made up of muscle fascicles lying parallel with one another, and are collected together into larger bundles separated by fibrous septa.

==Structure==
The gluteus maximus (or buttock) is the outermost muscle of the buttocks. It arises from connections to nearby structures in this area. It arises from the posterior gluteal line of the outer upper ilium, a bone of the pelvis, as well as above it to the iliac crest and slightly below it; from the lower part of the sacrum and the side of the coccyx, the tailbone; from the aponeurosis of the erector spinae (lumbodorsal fascia), the sacrotuberous ligament, and the fascia covering the gluteus medius (gluteal aponeurosis).

The fibers are directed obliquely inferiorly and laterally;

The gluteus maximus ends in two main areas:
*those forming the upper and larger portion of the muscle, together with the superficial fibers of the lower portion, end in a thick tendinous lamina, which passes across the greater trochanter, and inserts into the iliotibial band of the fascia lata;
*the deeper fibers of the lower portion are inserted into the gluteal tuberosity of the linea aspera, between the vastus lateralis and adductor magnus. If present, the third trochanter also serves as an attachment.

===Bursae===
Three bursae are usually found in relation with the deep surface of this muscle:
*One of these, of large size, separates it from the greater trochanter (&quot;Bursa trochanterica m. glutaei maximi&quot;),
*a second (often missing) is situated on the tuberosity of the ischium (&quot;Bursae glutaeofemorales&quot;),
*a third is found between the skin and the tendon of the muscle, which sometimes extends to the vastus lateralis (&quot;Bursa trochanterica subcutanea.&quot;

==Function==
The gluteus maximus straightens the leg at the hip; when the leg is flexed at the hip, the gluteus maximus extends it to bring the leg into a straight line with the body. The anus also aligns when the leg is flexed at the hip, making the muscle tighten and the pelvis tilt forward. Taking its fixed point from below, it acts upon the pelvis, supporting it and the trunk upon the head of the femur; this is particularly obvious in standing on one leg. Its most powerful action is to cause the body to regain the erect position after stooping, by drawing the pelvis backward, being assisted in this action by the biceps femoris (long head), semitendinosus, semimembranosus, and adductor magnus.

The lower part of the muscle also acts as an adductor and external rotator of the limb. The upper fibers act as abductors of the hip joints.

The gluteus maximus is a tensor of the fascia lata, and by its connection with the iliotibial band steadies the femur on the articular surfaces of the tibia during standing, when the extensor muscles are relaxed. Therefore, the muscle carries out an extension, a valgisation and an external rotation of the knee.

==Society and culture==

===Training===

The gluteus maximus is involved in several sports, from running to weight-lifting. A number of exercises focus on the gluteus maximus and other muscles of the upper leg:
*Hip thrusts
*Glute bridge
*Quadruped hip extensions
*Kettlebell swings
*Squats and variations like split squats, unilateral squats with the raised foot positioned either backwards or forwards (pistols), and wide-stance lunges
*Deadlift (and variations)
*Reverse hyperextension
*Four-way hip extensions
*Glute-ham raise

===In art===
In cultural terms, the glutes are often considered a symbol of health and strength, and aesthetically appealing. They frequently feature in artwork which seeks to emphasise and celebrate physicality, and the ability to move dynamically and powerfully. They are usually shown to be efficiently proportioned and prominent.

Evidence of such depictions of the gluteal muscles extends from at least Ancient Greece to the modern day.

==Clinical significance==
Functional assessment can be useful in assessing injuries to the gluteus maximus and surrounding muscles.

The 30-second chair-to-stand test measures a participant&#x27;s ability to stand up from a seated position as many times as possible in a thirty-second period of time. Testing the number of times a person can stand up in a thirty-second period helps assess strength, flexibility, pain, and endurance, which can help determine how far along a person is in rehabilitation, or how much work is still to be done.

The piriformis test measures flexibility of the gluteus maximus. This requires a trained professional and is based on the angle of external and internal rotation in relation to normal range of motion without injury or impingement.

==Other animals==
The gluteus maximus is larger in size and thicker in humans than in other primates. Specifically, it is approximately 1.6 times larger relative to body mass compared to chimpanzees and comprises about 18.3% of total hip musculature mass versus 11.7% in chimpanzees. Its large size is one of the most characteristic features of the muscular system in humans, connected as it is with the power of maintaining the trunk in the erect posture. Other primates have much flatter hips and cannot sustain standing erectly.
In other primates, the correlate to the human gluteus maximus consists of the ischiofemoralis, a small muscle that corresponds to the human gluteus maximus and originates from the ilium and the ligaments of the sacroiliac, and the gluteus maximus proprius, a large muscle that extends from the ischial tuberosity to a relatively more distant insertion on the femur. In adapting to bipedal gait, reorganization of the attachment of the muscle as well as the moment arm was required.

== Running ==
The human gluteus maximus plays multiple important functional roles, particularly in running rather than walking. During running, it helps control trunk flexion, aids in decelerating the swing leg, and contributes to hip extension. During level walking, the muscle shows minimal activity, suggesting its enlargement was not primarily adapted for walking.

The muscle&#x27;s size and position make it uniquely suited for controlling trunk position during rapid movements and stabilizing the trunk against flexion. While traditionally associated with maintaining erect posture, evidence suggests its enlargement was more likely selected for its role in running capability and trunk stabilization during various dynamic activities. These adaptations would have been particularly important for activities like running and climbing in early human evolution.

<text>The minister of innovation, science, and industry () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for overseeing the economic development and corporate affairs department of the government of Canada; Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.

The minister of innovation, science and industry is also the minister responsible for Statistics Canada. By convention, the minister of innovation, science and industry also serves as the registrar general of Canada.

The current minister of innovation, science and industry is François-Philippe Champagne.

== History ==
===First century of Canada===
The office of the registrar general of Canada has traditionally been associated with the responsibility of overseeing corporate affairs, by virtue of its function in registering all letters patent. From Confederation to 1966, the secretary of state for Canada was the registrar general. Between 1966 and 1995, the office was held by the minister of consumer and corporate affairs.

The National Research Council of Canada was established in 1916, under the pressure of World War I, to advise the government on matters of science and industrial research. In 1932, laboratories were built on Sussex Drive in Ottawa.

The economic development function of the portfolio can be traced from the office of the minister of trade and commerce, which was created in 1892. The post of minister of industry briefly existed, between 1963 and 1969, as a successor to the post of minister of defence production. It was merged with the trade and commerce portfolio in 1969. The post of minister of industry, trade and commerce existed between 1969 and 1983. During that time, separate posts of minister of regional economic expansion (1969 to 1983) and minister of regional industrial expansion (1983–1990) also existed. In 1990, the post of minister of industry, science and technology was created.

University funding was a problem for the government of Canada over the first three-quarters of the 20th century. In 1967 the passage of the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (FPFAA) replaced the policy of direct federal grants to the universities with a system of transfers to the provincial governments to support the operating costs of universities, which are a provincial responsibility under the 1867 British North America Act.

Over the course of seven years, from 1970, the so-called Lamontagne Report on &quot;A Science Policy for Canada&quot; detailed the work of the Senate Special Committee on Science Policy. Several avenues were investigated by the Canadian Cabinet, including the nomination of the Royal Society of Canada as the exclusive distributor of federal &quot;governmental science and technology contract services&quot; funds for post-secondary education, in a &quot;national academy of science&quot; type arrangement but this avenue was rejected because of the provincial responsibility factor.

===1977 GOSA Act===
In 1977 the funding of university research in Canada was formally separated from the NRC, under the Established Programs Financing Act and the Government Organization (Scientific Activities) Act, 1976 (GOSA Act). Several legally-distinct bodies were created to disburse federal government monies: the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council, the Canada Council, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, the National Research Council, the Defence Research Board, the Medical Research Council (latterly renamed to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research) and the National Library of Canada each nurture the related trade. Of these bodies, the first, third, fourth, fifth and sixth report to the minister of innovation. The government provides subsidy (the major source of federal government funding to post-secondary research) and the scientists look after the details. The first, third and sixth bodies are sometimes collectively referred to as the &quot;Tri-Council&quot; or &quot;Tri-Agency&quot;. The effect of the GOSA Act was dramatic, as reported by Rogers and McLean: &quot;since 1979-80, federal support for self-initiated, non-contractual research in education has increased from C$126,000 to more than C$1.7 million&quot; in 1986.

The present system grants directly to faculty members for research projects under such policies as the Canada Research Chair programme, and provides capital funds on a &quot;shared-cost basis&quot; for large infrastructure projects, such as buildings or laboratories. Fisher and Rubenson write that &quot;both types of funding are disbursed by federal granting agencies [such as the Tri-Council bodies] on a competitive basis and awarded in accordance with federal criteria, which includes merit and national interests&quot;, observance of human rights and the general direction of state. &quot;Furthermore, these policy decisions are set within a science and technology policy that emerged from competing definitions of science, utility, and the &quot;public good&quot;. At the policy level, the interests of capital are privileged under the guise of serving the national interest.&quot;

From 1993 to 1995, a single minister was styled as minister of industry while concurrently holding the posts of industry, science and technology, and of consumer and corporate affairs, pending a government restructuring. The post of minister of industry was formally created in 1995 under the direction of John Manley.

===Since 2000===
On 4 November 2015 the office was renamed to its current name in the 29th Canadian Ministry of Justin Trudeau.

<text>&quot;California Dreamin&quot; is a song written by John and Michelle Phillips in 1963 and first recorded by Barry McGuire. The best-known version is by the Mamas &amp; the Papas, who sang backup on the original version and released it as a single in December 1965. The lyrics express the narrator&#x27;s longing for the warmth of Los Angeles during a cold winter in New York City. It is recorded in the key of C-sharp minor.

&quot;California Dreamin became a signpost of the California sound, heralding the arrival of the nascent counterculture era. It was certified three-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in June 2023 and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2001. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; placed the song at number 420 in its &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; list.

==History==
The song was written in 1963 while John Phillips and Michelle Phillips were living in New York City during a particularly cold winter, and the latter was missing sunny California. John would work on compositions late at night and brought Michelle the first verse one morning. At the time, John and Michelle Phillips were members of the folk group the New Journeymen, which evolved into the Mamas and the Papas.

They earned their first record contract after being introduced to Lou Adler, the head of Dunhill Records, by Barry McGuire. In thanks to Adler, they sang the backing vocals to &quot;California Dreamin, with members of the session band The Wrecking Crew, on McGuire&#x27;s album &quot;This Precious Time&quot;. Adler, impressed with the Mamas and the Papas, then had the lead vocal track re-recorded with Denny Doherty singing, but paired with the same instrumental and backing vocal tracks, and an alto flute solo by Bud Shank, reportedly improvised. The guitar introduction was performed by P. F. Sloan. McGuire&#x27;s original vocal can be briefly heard on the left channel at the beginning of the record, having not been completely erased.

The single was released in late 1965 but was not an immediate breakthrough. After gaining little attention in Los Angeles, a radio station in Boston was the catalyst to break the song nationwide. After making its chart debut in January 1966, the song peaked at No. 4 in March on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, lasting 17 weeks, and &quot;Cashbox&quot;, lasting 20 weeks. &quot;California Dreamin was the top single on the &quot;Billboard&quot; end-of-the-year survey for 1966. As well, it tied for #1 on the Cashbox end-of-the-year survey with SSgt. Barry Sadler&#x27;s &quot;Ballad of the Green Berets&quot;.

&quot;California Dreamin reached number 23 on the UK charts upon its original release, and re-charted after its use in a Carling Premier commercial in 1997, peaking at number nine. 

&quot;Billboard&quot; described the song as having &quot;a fascinating new sound with well written commercial material&quot; and praised Lou Adler&#x27;s production.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; described it as a &quot;medium-paced, rhythmic shufflin&#x27; romantic woeser [sic] with a plaintive, lyrical undercurrent.&quot;

The song is used repeatedly in the 1994 Hong Kong film &quot;Chungking Express&quot; as a central plot point and a cover by the Beach Boys was used on season 4 of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;.

Michelle Phillips wrote the lyrics, &quot;Well, I got down on my knees / And I pretend to pray,&quot; but Cass Elliot had sung &quot;began&quot; on the original recording and had continued doing so on tour until corrected by Phillips.

===America version===

In the spring of 1979, the band America reached No. 56 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with their remake of &quot;California Dreamin which was the first studio recording by America as the duo of Gerry Beckley and Dewey Bunnell without third founding member Dan Peek, who had departed the group in 1977. Bunnell – who sang lead – and Beckley – who sang background – self-produced the track which featured America&#x27;s touring musicians: David Dickey, drummer Willie Leacox, guitarist Michael Woods, percussionist Tom Walsh, and Jim Calire who played keyboards and also saxophone.

America performed &quot;California Dreamin at least once in concert in 1974, &quot;California Dreamin being a sentimental favorite of the band&#x27;s members having been a setlist staple of the cover band in which all three had performed while London Central High School students in the late 1960s. The recording of &quot;California Dreamin by America was specifically made to play under the closing credits of the American International Pictures (AIP) movie release &quot;California Dreaming&quot; which had been shot in the final months of 1977 for release in the summer of 1978 although the movie was held back from wide release until March 16, 1979 with America recording the song &quot;California Dreamin in the autumn of 1978: Beckley and Bunnell agreed to record the song after being (at least partially) shown the movie – &quot;We liked what we saw&quot; – and the track was recorded at Studio 55 (Hollywood): &quot;We did it more as a rock thing [compared to the original], [with] a full sound but reliant on the harmonies.&quot;

The track was originally scheduled for a January 15, 1979, release which was delayed until after AIP&#x27;s February 1979 pacting with Casablanca Records to distribute the &quot;California Dreaming&quot; soundtrack, Casablanca having recently managed to bolster the modest success of the film &quot;Thank God It&#x27;s Friday&quot; through a hit soundtrack album: the recording of &quot;California Dreamin by America was therefore given parallel release with the movie, another soundtrack item: &quot;See It My Way&quot; by session group F.D.R., serving as B-side. Both the America single and (in April 1978) the soundtrack album were issued by AIP on its own label (distributed by Casablanca): outside the US and Canada, Casablanca acted as label of release.
By the spring of 1979, America were involved in sessions for their Capitol Records debut album &quot;Silent Letter&quot; and were either unable or uninterested in promoting their version of &quot;California Dreamin which single proved unable to buoy its parent film&#x27;s faltering box office take. However the publicity inherent in the film&#x27;s release was evidently enough to afford minor hit status to America&#x27;s soundtrack item (heard in the film&#x27;s trailer, America&#x27;s &quot;California Dreamin was also cited in the movie&#x27;s poster), and despite its lowly chart peak, America&#x27;s &quot;California Dreamin remake was more successful than any of their first five Capitol single releases, none of which ranked in the Hot 100 (the band&#x27;s sixth Capitol single release, &quot;You Can Do Magic&quot; in 1982 afforded the band a sole latter-day top ten hit).

&quot;California Dreamin continued to be featured in America&#x27;s live gigs eventually being established as a mandatory America concert title. A live performance of the song by America is featured on &quot;In Concert&quot;, the band&#x27;s 1996 album release of a 1982 live gig. The band&#x27;s 1978 recording was included on the 2000 America retrospective box set &quot;Highway: 30 Years of America&quot; as well as on &quot;The Complete Greatest Hits&quot; in 2001.

===Beach Boys version===
====Background====
The Beach Boys recorded &quot;California Dreamin in 1986 for their greatest hits compilation &quot;Made in U.S.A.&quot; It was produced by Terry Melcher and featured Roger McGuinn of the Byrds on 12-string guitar. This version of the song was referenced in the lyrics of the Dead Milkmen&#x27;s 1988 novelty hit &quot;Punk Rock Girl&quot;.

Although the song only charted at a modest No. 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, it reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard Adult&quot; Contemporary chart and it was supported by a music video that saw heavy rotation on MTV. The video featured the Beach Boys along with John Phillips, Michelle Phillips and Roger McGuinn. Denny Doherty was on the East coast and declined; Cass Elliot had died in 1974.

Released as a single on RCA Records in the summer of 1968, José Feliciano&#x27;s arrangement reached number 43 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart and number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rhythm &amp; Blues Singles chart. The song was the A-side of a single which became a big hit when radio stations started to play the B-side with his cover of &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, which reached number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and was popular in many other countries around the world. This elaborate string version with jazz Latin influences serves as the opening track of Feliciano&#x27;s 1968 hit album &quot;Feliciano!&quot; (gold status in 1968), and was heard in a key sequence in Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2019 film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Hollywood&quot; and is included on its soundtrack.

<doc id="621279" wikidata="Q602702" url="?curid=621279" title="Henri René Guieu">
<text>Henri René Guieu (19 March 1926 – 2 January 2000) was a French science fiction writer and ufologist, who published primarily with the pseudonym Jimmy Guieu. He occasionally used other pseudonyms as well, including &quot;Claude Vauzière&quot; for a young adult series, &quot;Jimmy G. Quint&quot; (with Georges Pierquin) for a number of espionage novels, &quot;Claude Rostaing&quot; for two detective novels and &quot;Dominique Verseau&quot; for six erotic novels.

==Overview==
Guieu was one of the authors published by Fleuve Noir company&#x27;s &quot;Anticipation&quot; science fiction imprint.

His first novel, &quot;Le Pionnier de l&#x27;Atome&quot; [The Pioneer of the Atom] (1952), concerned a journey into the microcosmos through psychic powers. With his second novel, &quot;Au-delà de l&#x27;Infini&quot; [Beyond Infinity] (1952), Guieu introduced the character of American biologist Jerry Barclay and reversed the theme. This time, it was our universe that was a microcosmos contained within the knee of a beautiful woman from a macrocosmos. Guieu continued the &quot;Jerry Barclay&quot; series for three more books.

With &quot;La Dimension X&quot; [Dimension X] (1953) and &quot;Nous les Martiens&quot; [We The Martians] (1954), Guieu introduced a new hero: archeologist &quot;Jean Kariven&quot;. In the &quot;Kariven&quot; series, Guieu began to explore his favorite themes such as UFOs, close encounters, Erich Von Däniken-like theories of ancient astronauts, secret societies, lost civilizations and occult conspiracies. Throughout his novels he featured footnotes claiming that the various facts upon which he was basing his tales were indeed &quot;authentic&quot;. In &quot;Nous les Martiens&quot; [We The Martians], Kariven discovers that, during the remote past, men had emigrated to Earth from Mars. Eight more Kariven novels were published subsequently, often pitting good aliens from Polaris versus evil aliens from Deneb with Earth secretly caught in the middle. &quot;Univers Parallèles&quot; [Parallel Universes] featured a crossover with Jerry Barclay.

Guieu continued to exploit his UFO and occult theme with increasing success. After the &quot;Kariven&quot; series, he published a number of novels unrelated to each other, except for two that featured a team of American investigative reporters, &quot;Ericksson and Wendell&quot;: &quot;Les Monstres du Néant&quot; [The Monsters From The Void] (1956) and &quot;Les Êtres de Feu&quot; [The Beings of Fire] (1956).

He also wrote two non-fiction books about UFOs, one of the first published into the story of ufology, &quot;Les Soucoupes Volantes viennent d&#x27;un Autre Monde&quot; [The Flying Saucers Come From Another World] and &quot;Black-Out sur les Soucoupes Volantes&quot; [Black-Out on the Flying Saucers], the latter prefaced by Jean Cocteau, and by the 1970s, had become a major French ufologist.

Simultaneously, Guieu began to chronicle the exploits of two daring space traders, Blade and Baker. The series began with &quot;Les Forbans de l&#x27;Espace&quot; [The Space Pirates] (1963).

During 1967, with &quot;Le Retour des Dieux&quot; [The Return of the Gods], Guieu revamped the Kariven character into that of journalist Gilles Novak who, with the help of his girl-friend Régine Véran, and various friends and allies, often real-life friends of Guieu or thinly-disguised real-life figures, fought against would-be tyrants, communists, terrorists, drug cartels and various alien menaces. Novak was helped in his struggles by Michael Merkavim, the commander of a new, powerful Order of Knights Templar, equipped with futuristic weapons and based in a parallel universe. Merkavim was introduced in &quot;Les Sept Sceaux du Cosmos&quot; [The Seven Seals of the Cosmos] (1968) and &quot;L&#x27;Ordre Vert&quot; [The Green Order] (1969). The theme was later developed as the Les Chevaliers de Lumière (&quot;The Knights of Light&quot;) sub-series.

Guieu was granted his own imprint during 1979. At first, it reprinted rewritten, updated versions of his original novels, then it began publishing a series of &quot;sharecropping&quot; novels, featuring &quot;Gilles Novak&quot;, &quot;Blade and Baker&quot;, &quot;Jean Kariven,&quot; etc., written by other writers, mostly Roland C. Wagner, but also Philippe Randa, Nicolas Gauthier and Laurent Genefort.

During the early 1990s, Jimmy Guieu wrote two docu-dramas, using as plot the Grey aliens / Majestic-12 conspiracy as described by John Lear and Milton William Cooper : the series &quot;E.B.E.&quot; (for &quot;Extraterrestrial Biological Entity&quot;) : &quot;E.B.E. : Alerte rouge&quot; (first part) (1990) and &quot;E.B.E. : L&#x27;entité noire d&#x27;Andamooka&quot; (second part) (1991).

<text>Peter David Ebdon (born 27 August 1970) is an English retired professional snooker player who is a former world champion and current coach. Ebdon won nine ranking titles during his career, placing him in joint 12th position (with John Parrott) on the all-time list of ranking tournament winners. He won two Triple Crown titles, the 2002 World Snooker Championship and the 2006 UK Championship. 

After winning the 1990 IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship, Ebdon turned professional in the 1991–92 season. He made his first Crucible appearance at the 1992 World Snooker Championship, reaching the quarter-finals on his debut. Winning his first professional ranking title at the 1993 Grand Prix helped him enter the top 16 in the world rankings for the 1994–95 season; he remained consistently in the top 16 until the end of the 2009–10 season, reaching a career high of third. He made 24 Crucible appearances during his career and reached three World Championship finals, losing 12–18 to Stephen Hendry in 1996, defeating Hendry 18–17 in 2002, and losing 14–18 to Graeme Dott in 2006. He won his last ranking title at the 2012 China Open and reached the last of his 18 ranking event finals at the 2018 Paul Hunter Classic. He retired from the professional tour at the end of the 2019–20 season, aged 49, due to chronic neck and spinal pain. 

Known for his intensity and his often controversially slow playing style, Ebdon made 377 century breaks in professional competition, including two maximum breaks. Since retiring as a player, Ebdon has coached and mentored current professionals including Shaun Murphy, Jack Lisowski, Anthony McGill, Elliot Slessor, and Kyren Wilson.

==Career==

===Amateur career===
From the mid-1980s, Ebdon took part in various amateur tournaments and became one of the leading amateurs of his era. He won the 1990 IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship, defeating Oliver King 11–9 in the final.

===Early professional career and World Championship win (1991–2002)===
Ebdon turned professional in 1991. Making his Crucible debut at the 1992 World Championship, he defeated Steve Davis 10–4 in the first round and went on to reach the quarter-finals, losing 7–13 to Terry Griffiths. This earned Ebdon the WPBSA&#x27;s &quot;Young Player of the Year&quot; award. He won his first ranking title at the 1993 Grand Prix, defeating Ken Doherty 9–6 in the final. His second title was the 1995 Irish Masters, defeating Stephen Hendry 9–8 in the final, and reached his first Triple Crown final at the 1995 UK Championship, but lost 3–10 to Hendry. He first entered the top 16 for the 1994–95 season, and rose to a career high of third in the 1996–97 season, a position he reached again in the 2002–03 season.

At the 1996 World Snooker Championship, Ebdon defeated Jimmy White in the last 16, Steve Davis in the quarter-finals, and Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in the semi-finals to reach his first world final, which he lost 12–18 to Hendry. He subsequently won the 1997 Thailand Open, defeating Nigel Bond 9–7 in the final; the 2000 British Open, defeating White 9–6 in the final; and the 2001 Scottish Open, defeating Doherty 9–7 in the final.

Ebdon defeated Michael Judge, Joe Perry, Anthony Hamilton, and Matthew Stevens to reach his second world final at the 2002 World Snooker Championship. He won his only world title, clinching an 18–17 victory over Hendry. Having started the tournament at odds of 33–1, he stated: &quot;It&#x27;s what I have been working for and dreaming about for the last 17 years... I wasn&#x27;t ready to win it six years ago, but I&#x27;ve improved as a player and as a person&quot;.

===Post–World Championship win (2002–2011)===
Defending his title at the 2003 World Championship, Ebdon faced Paul Hunter in the quarter-finals. Ebdon came from 10–12 behind to force a deciding frame, but Hunter clinched a 13–12 victory after a match that lasted 8 hours and 4 minutes.
The slower pace of Ebdon&#x27;s play after his world title attracted criticism, especially when he played O&#x27;Sullivan in the 2005 World Championship quarter-finals. Ebdon began the third session of the match trailing 6–10, but won seven of the last eight frames for a 13–11 victory, despite making a highest break of 60 and having an average shot time of 37 seconds. At one stage, Ebdon took three minutes over a shot, and took five minutes to compile a break of 12. Ebdon stated after the match: &quot;When I&#x27;m trying my hardest I seem to go slow. I don&#x27;t do it intentionally&quot;. When &quot;The Times&quot; described his slow play as &quot;cheating&quot;, he sued for libel.

At the 2006 World Snooker Championship, Ebdon led Marco Fu 15–9 in the semi-finals. Fu won seven of the next eight frames to tie the scores at 16–16, but Ebdon won the deciding frame to reach his third world final, where he faced Graeme Dott. Trailing 7–15 before the final session, Ebdon won six successive frames, but Dott won the match 18–14. Later that year, Ebdon won his second Triple Crown title at the 2006 UK Championship, defeating Ding Junhui in the quarter-finals, John Higgins in the semi-finals, and Hendry 10–6 in the final. 

At the 2008 World Championship, Ebdon defeated Mark King 13–9 in the second round to reach the quarter-finals. He lost 9–13 to Ali Carter, who made a maximum break during the match. This was the last time Ebdon featured in the later stages of a World Championship; his final seven Crucible appearances all ended in first-round defeats.

In the 2008 Northern Ireland Trophy, Ebdon lost 0–5 to Liang Wenbo, making a highest break of 32. After the match, the Gambling Commission expressed concern about attempts by punters to place unusually large bets for Ebdon to lose 0–5 and not to make a break over 50. However, the WPBSA did not instigate a match-fixing investigation. Ebdon won the 2009 China Open with a 10–8 victory over John Higgins in the final, but lost 5–10 to Bond in the first round of the 2009 World Championship. After a disappointing 2009–10 season, Ebdon lost 5–10 to Dott in the first round of the 2010 World Championship. This result ended Ebdon&#x27;s 16 consecutive seasons ranked within the top 16 in the world rankings. Ebdon stated he was &quot;bitterly disappointed but also very proud&quot; to have been in the top 16 for so many years.
At the 2010 World Open, Ebdon reached the semi-finals, losing 1–3 to O&#x27;Sullivan. His first semi-final appearance since the 2009 China Open, it saw him re-enter the top 16. Ebdon lost in the first round of the 2010 UK Championship and lost 8–10 to Stuart Bingham in the first round of the 2011 World Championship. However, Ebdon was ranked number 13 at the end of the season.

===Fall from the top 16 (2011–15)===
Ebdon fell out of the top 16 again early in the 2011–12 season, meaning he had to qualify for the main stage of ranking events thereafter. He lost his first 2011 UK Championship qualifying match 3–6 to Robert Milkins, meaning that he did not feature at the tournament&#x27;s main stage for the first time since 1991. He missed the 2012 Masters, the first time he had not featured at the event since 1992. At the PTC series, he played in all 12 events, but won only four matches all season. He finished 98th in the Order of Merit and fell to number 28 in the rankings in March 2012.

Ebdon won the 2012 China Open, defeating John Higgins, Neil Robertson, and Ding before beating Stephen Maguire 10–9 in the final. This boosted his ranking to number 21. During the final, he recorded his 300th century break. At the 2012 World Championship, he recorded a 10–0 whitewash over Alfie Burden in qualifying, but lost 4–10 to O&#x27;Sullivan in the first round. He finished the season ranked world number 20.

Ebdon began the 2012–13 season by qualifying for the Wuxi Classic, but lost 4–5 to Bingham in the first round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the Australian Goldfields Open, he defeated Michael Holt, Ding, and Shaun Murphy, all by 5–4 scorelines. His match against Ding provoked controversy, with Ebdon recording an average shot time of 32 seconds in a nine-frame encounter that lasted almost five hours. Judd Trump on Twitter called it a &quot;joke&quot; that Ebdon was permitted to play so slowly. In the semi-finals, Ebdon defeated Fu 6–2, despite his opponent having an over 90 percent pot success, 80 percent long pot success, and 80 percent safety success. Facing Barry Hawkins in the final, Ebdon lost 3–9, admitting afterwards that he had struggled in every department of his game. He lost in the first round of the 2012 Shanghai Masters, but reached the semi-finals of the inaugural 2012 International Championship, where he lost 1–9 to Trump.

By qualifying for the 2013 World Championship, Ebdon equalled Steve Davis&#x27;s then-record 22 consecutive appearances in the tournament. He faced Dott in a match that lasted seven hours, spread over three sessions, as Ebdon recovered from 2–6 behind to level at 6–6, before losing 6–10. After the match, Dott called for rules to combat slow play. Ebdon fell to world number 30 in the world rankings after the tournament.

Ebdon&#x27;s run of 22 consecutive Crucible appearances ended at the 2014 World Snooker Championship, when he lost 8–10 to Robin Hull in qualifying, missing the event&#x27;s main stage for the first time since turning professional. He failed to qualify for the event again in 2015, losing 7–10 to Stuart Carrington in the second qualifying round.&lt;ref name=&quot;2014/15&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career and retirement (2015–20)===
At the 2015 UK Championship, Ebdon beat opponents including reigning world champion Bingham to reach the last 16, where he lost 2–6 to David Grace. At 45, he was the oldest competitor at the 2016 World Grand Prix; he defeated Robertson 4–3 before Ding whitewashed him 0–4 in the second round. At the 2016 World Championship, Ebdon defeated James Wattana 10–6 in the first qualifying round. He came from 3–9 behind against Gerard Greene to win 10–9 in the second round, the match ending just after 2:00 a.m. He qualified for the Crucible for the first time in three years by defeating Ian Burns 10–2 in the final qualifying round. However, he lost 2–10 to Fu in the first round.

Ebdon reached the quarter-finals of the 2016 Indian Open, where he lost 3–4 to Bond. He made his 24th and last Crucible appearance at the 2017 World Championship, after beating Holt 10–9 on the final black to qualify. He won the ninth frame of his first-round match against Bingham on a re-spotted black, after having required four snookers, and trailed 4–5 overnight; however, he lost the match 5–10. He ended the season ranked 40th in the world, the first time since 1992 he had finished a season outside the top 32.

Ebdon reached his 18th and last ranking event final at the 2018 Paul Hunter Classic, where he lost 2–4 to Kyren Wilson. He played his last professional match at the 2020 German Masters qualifiers in December 2019, losing 4–5 to Stevens. Following months of chronic neck and spinal pain, Ebdon announced his retirement from professional snooker on 30 April 2020, stating that he was unwilling to undergo spinal surgery in an effort to remain in the sport.

=== Coaching career (2021–present) ===
In 2021, Ebdon became mentor and coach to Jack Lisowski, who reached his first world quarter-final at the 2022 World Championship and credited his improved performance to Ebdon. Ebdon also coaches and mentors current professionals Anthony McGill, Elliot Slessor, and Kyren Wilson.

==Status==

Ebdon was the third player to make two competitive maximum breaks in professional tournament play—at the Strachan Professional and UK Championship, both in 1992. In the same year, he became the first player to make four centuries in five frames. He won World Championship and UK Championship titles but never completed a career Triple Crown; his best Masters performances were semi-finals at the 1995 and 2005 events, which he lost respectively to O&#x27;Sullivan and Higgins. Ebdon was criticised by other professionals for his slow play as well as his exuberant outpourings of emotion after winning important frames or matches, with O&#x27;Sullivan once calling him a &quot;psycho&quot;.

==Personal life==

Born in Islington, London, Ebdon later moved to Wellingborough, Northamptonshire. He attended Highbury Grove School, where he played oboe in the school orchestra, studied Latin and Greek, and represented North London at cricket. He dropped out of school to pursue his snooker career, after which his father did not speak to him for six months. Ebdon later stated that he regretted not sitting his O levels.

In the early years of his professional career, Ebdon became known for wearing his hair in a ponytail. He is also colour blind. While playing snooker, he often asked the referee for help on distinguishing the brown ball from red balls. In several notable matches, Ebdon played foul shots because he confused the two colours.

He had four children with his first wife Deborah. In 2005, he emigrated to Dubai with his wife and children, stating that the move was due to tax reasons, lower crime rates, and better weather. He lived there until 2009, when he announced that he and Deborah had separated by mutual consent after 16 years of marriage. In 2010, Ebdon married his second wife, Nora, whom he first met at a players&#x27; party at a snooker event in Austria. After their marriage, they lived in Nora&#x27;s home country of Hungary. Ebdon was declared bankrupt in 2015. 

Ebdon became known for his focus on fitness, including swimming one mile every day. In 2012, he adopted a vegan diet. He is a devotee of Napoleon Hill&#x27;s motivational book &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot;. In 2018, he became a professional healer at the College of Healing in Malvern. He has a longstanding interest in breeding racehorses. He has released three music singles.

Shortly after his retirement, Ebdon was criticised for promoting conspiracy theories. In a May 2020 interview on BBC Radio 5 Live, he discussed the COVID-19 pandemic, calling social distancing guidelines &quot;harmful&quot;, stating that people were being &quot;brainwashed&quot;, and claiming that the public was &quot;facing the greatest psychological operation in history&quot;. During the interview, Ebdon referenced individuals who had made unsubstantiated claims about topics such as the September 11 attacks and the Manchester Arena bombing, prompting &quot;Telegraph&quot; sports journalist James Corrigan to ask if winning the World Snooker Championship &quot;gives you the right to propagate wild conspiracy theories on a national radio show&quot;.

<text>Morris Communications, headquartered in Augusta, Georgia, is a privately held media company with diversified holdings that include magazine publishing, outdoor advertising, book publishing and distribution, visitor publications, and online services.

Morris Communications is the parent company to Morris Media Network. Morris Media Network consists of city magazines and special interest magazines including travel. Morris brands include Alaska Magazine, American Angler, Skirt!, The Milepost, Western Horseman, and the Where series for travelers.

Morris Communications is separate from Morris Multimedia, which was founded by Charles H. Morris, a member of the same family that founded Morris Communications.

==History==
William S. Morris Jr. began working in the media industry in 1929 when he got a job as a bookkeeper at The &quot;Augusta Chronicle&quot;. He and his wife bought stock in the paper in 1945 and founded Southeastern Newspapers, Inc. They bought the remaining shares of the &quot;Chronicle&quot; in 1955 and expanded with the purchase of the &quot;Augusta Herald&quot;. Their son William S. &quot;Billy&quot; Morris III joined the company in 1956. Additional newspapers in Georgia were added in the coming years. Billy was appointed President of the company in 1966, and the name was changed to Morris Communications Corp. in 1970.

The company continued to expand, adding interests radio and television as well as newspapers in Alaska, Florida, and Texas. The company purchased Florida Publishing Co., owners of &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; and &quot;The St. Augustine Record&quot;, on January 1, 1983. The company expanded into outdoor advertising in 1985 with the purchase of Naegele Outdoor Advertising, which they renamed Fairway Outdoor Advertising in 1991 after selling various units to other companies. In 1995, they expanded into Kansas by acquiring Stauffer Communications, which had a portfolio of newspapers and TV and radio stations. They added travel guides starting with the acquisition of Best Read Guide Franchise Corp in 1997, and added &quot;Guest Informant&quot; in 2001. They acquired &quot;The London Guide and the be IN series&quot; from the publishers NBC in London. They then expanded with the takeover of &quot;Where&quot; in 2004. Another subsidiary, Morris Publications Ltd. UK, was created in 1998, when Cadogan Guides of London was purchased. They acquired &quot;London This Week&quot;, renaming it the &quot;London Planner&quot;.

Morris Publishing Group (MPG) was formed in 2001 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Morris Communications to handle the newspaper side of the corporation. MPG published twelve daily newspapers, eleven non-daily papers, and numerous free community newspapers in the US. In 2017, the MPG division and its portfolio of newspapers was sold to GateHouse Media for $120M. Included in the sale were Augusta Chronicle, Savannah Morning News, Athens Banner-Herald, Florida Times-Union, St. Augustine Record, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Amarillo Globe-News, Topeka Capital-Journal, Log Cabin Democrat, Juneau Empire, and Peninsula Clarion.

==Challenges ==
With the decline of the newspaper industry, Morris Communications cut employee wages in 2009 to prevent further layoffs.

In 2010, Morris Publishing Group filed a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization with $415 million in debt.

On May 18, 2015, Morris announced that it had sold its 36 radio stations to Alpha Media.

On October 14, 2015, it was revealed that Morris Communications Company VP of audience sent a company-wide email to maintain specific editorial positions to make a political point. This has put the organization into question relating to its ethics. Further issues arose with Morris Communications&#x27; failure to respond for comment.

In 2004, Morris unsuccessfully brought suit against PGA Tour, alleging that PGA Tour violated section 2 of the Sherman Act, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 2, by monopolizing the markets for (1) the publication of compiled real-time golf scores on the Internet, and (2) the sale, or syndication of those scores. In addition, Morris alleged that PGA Tour further violated section 2 of the Sherman Act by refusing to deal with Morris. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of PGA Tour because it found, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that PGA Tour had a valid business justification for its actions.

<text>Hexaplex trunculus (previously known as Murex trunculus, Phyllonotus trunculus, or the banded dye-murex) is a medium-sized sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex shells or rock snails. It is included in the subgenus &quot;Trunculariopsis&quot;.

This species is a group of opportunist predatory snails that are known to attack their prey in groups. What is peculiar about this specific species is that they show no preference for the size of their prey, regardless of their hunger levels.

The snail appears in fossil records dating between the Pliocene and Quaternary periods (between 3.6 and 0.012 million years ago). Fossilized shells have been found in Morocco, Italy, and Spain.

This sea snail is historically important because its hypobranchial gland secretes a mucus used to create a distinctive purple-blue indigo dye. Ancient Mediterranean cultures, including the Minoans, Canaanites/Phoenicians and classical Greeks created dyes from the snails. One of the dye&#x27;s main chemical ingredients is red dibromo-indigotin, the main component of tyrian purple or tekhelet. The dye will turn indigo blue, similar to the color of blue jeans, if exposed to sunlight before the dye sets.

;Subspecies:
* &quot;Hexaplex trunculus trunculus&quot; 

==Distribution==

This species lives in the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic coasts of Europe and Africa, specifically Spain, Portugal, Morocco, the Canary Islands, Azores.
This murex occurs in shallow, sublittoral waters.
==Shell description==

&quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; has a broadly conical shell about 4 to 10 cm long. It has a rather high spire with seven angulated whorls, and the shell is formed similar to the shape of a fish. The shell is variable in sculpture and coloring with dark banding, in four varieties. The ribs sometimes develop thickenings or spines and give the shell a rough appearance. The shell is often covered in algae, which camouflages it, making it appear very similar to the seabed. 
== Human use ==
Snail secretions were used as dye in ancient times. People still eat the snail in Spain and Portugal.

===As ancient dye===
The oldest known purple textiles were discovered in Syria, dating back to the early second millennium BCE. Among these findings are textiles from a burial site at Chagar Bazar, which date back to the 18th to 16th centuries BCE, as well as samples of preserved textiles found in gypsum at the Royal Palace of Qatna. 
The ancient method for mass-producing blue dye from &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; has not been successfully reproduced. Today, with stronger reduction agents which are more transparent, it is possible to break the original purplish hue molecule and degrade it by introducing it to UV sun rays, resulting in a more blue color. Therefore, archeologists have confirmed &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; as the species used to create the purple-blue dye; large numbers of shells were recovered from inside ancient live-storage chambers that were used for harvesting. Apparently, 10 to 12,000 shells yielded only one gram of dye. Because of this, the dye was highly prized. Also known as &quot;Royal Purple&quot;, it was prohibitively expensive and was only used by the highest ranking aristocracy.

A similar dye, &quot;Tyrian purple&quot;, which is purple-red in color, was made from a related species of marine snail, &quot;Murex brandaris&quot;. This dye (alternatively known as &quot;imperial purple&quot;, see purple) was also prohibitively expensive.

Jews may have used the pigment from the shells to create a sky-blue, &quot;tekhelet&quot;, dye to put on the fringes that the Torah specifies for the corner of the prayer shawl. This blue dye would have been made by taking the yellow dye solution and letting it sit in the sunlight, and then dipping the wool in it. This dye was lost to history until it was rediscovered by Otto Elsner, a professor at the Shenkar College of Fibers in Haifa. Since then, it has been re-introduced as the authentic &quot;tekhelet&quot; and has once again been reinstated to the Jewish garment although only with limited acceptance.

<doc id="621294" wikidata="Q1067478" url="?curid=621294" title="RANDU">
<text>RANDU is a linear congruential pseudorandom number generator (LCG) of the Park–Miller type, which was used primarily in the 1960s and 1970s. It is defined by the recurrence

: formula_1

with the initial seed number formula_2 as an odd number. It generates pseudorandom integers formula_3 which are uniformly distributed in the interval , but in practical applications are often mapped into pseudorandom rationals formula_4 in the interval , by the formula
: formula_5

IBM&#x27;s RANDU is widely considered to be one of the most ill-conceived random number generators ever designed, and was described as &quot;truly horrible&quot; by Donald Knuth. It fails the spectral test badly for dimensions greater than 2, as shown below.

The reason for choosing these particular values for the multiplier and modulus had been that with a 32-bit-integer word size, the arithmetic of mod 231 and formula_6 calculations could be done quickly, using bitwise operators in hardware, but the values were chosen for computational convenience, not statistical quality.

== Problems with multiplier and modulus ==
For any linear congruential generator with modulus &quot;m&quot; used to generate points in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space, the points fall in no more than formula_7 parallel hyperplanes. This indicates that low-modulus LCGs are unsuited to high-dimensional Monte Carlo simulation. For &quot;m&quot; = 231 and &quot;n&quot; = 3, an LCG could have up to 2344 planes, theoretical maximum. A much tighter upper bound is proved in the same Marsaglia paper to be the sum of the absolute values of all the coefficients of the hyperplanes in standard form. That is, if the hyperplanes are of the form &quot;Ax&quot;1 + &quot;Bx&quot;2 + &quot;Cx&quot;3 = some integer such as 0, 1, 2 etc, then the maximum number of planes is |&quot;A&quot;| + |&quot;B&quot;| + |&quot;C&quot;|.

Now we examine the values of multiplier 65539 and modulus 231 chosen for RANDU. Consider the following calculation where every term should be taken mod 231. Start by writing the recursive relation as

: formula_8

which after expanding the quadratic factor becomes

: formula_9

(because )
and allows us to show the correlation between three points as

: formula_10

Summing the absolute values of the coefficients, we get no more than 16 planes in 3D, becoming only 15 planes on closer examination, as shown in the diagram above. Even by the standards of LCGs, this shows that RANDU is terrible: using RANDU for sampling a unit cube will only sample 15 parallel planes, not even close to the upper limit of formula_11 planes.

As a result of the wide use of RANDU in the early 1970s, many results from that time are seen as suspicious. This misbehavior was already detected in 1963 on a 36-bit computer, and carefully reimplemented on the 32-bit IBM System/360. It was believed to have been widely purged by the early 1990s but there were still FORTRAN compilers using it as late as 1999.

==Sample output==

The start of the RANDU&#x27;s output period for the initial seed formula_12 is
: 1, 65539, 393225, 1769499, 7077969, 26542323, … .

<doc id="621297" wikidata="Q384055" url="?curid=621297" title="Microsoft Train Simulator">
<text>Microsoft Train Simulator (informally abbreviated to MSTS) is a 2001 train simulator game developed by UK-based Kuju Entertainment and published by Microsoft Games (now known as Xbox Game Studios) for Windows. It was released on June 18, 2001.

==Features==
Microsoft Train Simulator allows players to operate a selection of trains on various routes within Europe, Asia, and North America. Gameplay features include the ability to couple wagons, start and stop them, as well as operate trains using mouse and keyboard or hardware accessories (e.g. Raildriver) as controls.

===Routes===
The game features six routes in four countries: Austria, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America.
==Reception==

===Critic reviews===
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. John Lee of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;All aboard for HO scale fans, trainspotters, and nostalgic rail buffs. Train haters, however, may prefer the old cliché, &#x27;Run for the roundhouse, boys. They can&#x27;t corner you there.&#x27;&quot;

===Sales===
The game sold 191,952 units in the U.S. by the end of 2001, which drew revenues of $8.7 million. These numbers rose to 330,000 units ($11.6 million) in the U.S. by August 2006. This led &quot;Edge&quot; to rank it as the country&#x27;s 54th-best-selling computer game released in the 21st century in 2006.

Internationally, the game received a &quot;Silver&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 100,000 units in the UK. In the German market, the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) presented it with a &quot;Gold&quot; certification in early 2003, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland.

The game sold one million units by 2005, and, despite its age, is still very popular and has a large, active community.

===Awards===
The game was nominated for the &quot;PC Simulation&quot; award at the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; 5th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator 2002&quot;.

==Mods==
The game also included a route and activity editor that enabled users to create and modify routes, trains, and activities. Additionally, the game also allowed for mod support to add and change routes, trains, cargo, scenery, etc. Over 30,000 mods have been created and are mostly hosted on community sites such as TrainSim.com, UKTrainsim.com, and ElvasTower.com. MSTS BIN, a community mod aimed at adding features and fixing old MSTS, was released in 2006.

==Cancelled sequel==

On May 7, 2003, Microsoft announced that it would be developing a sequel called &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator 2;&quot; it was first demoed to the public at E3 on May 15. Seemingly, its main improvements were the addition of people to the game (e.g. passengers waiting at the stations, people operating the new locomotive roster, etc.) and turntables. It was being developed by Kuju Entertainment, the original MSTS creators. Despite restructuring efforts at Kuju, the project was handed over to Microsoft Game Studios on August 18, 2003.

This project was ultimately halted, as the following statement on April 24, 2004, from Microsoft confirmed:
On January 19, 2007, Microsoft announced the relaunch of the &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; project. This time the game was being developed in-house by Aces Game Studio (Microsoft Game Studios) known for its long line of &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulators&quot;, as a part of the &quot;Games for Windows&quot; initiative. The game would have used the &quot;Microsoft Flight Simulator X&quot; graphics engine, and it was planned to be compatible with both Windows Vista and Windows XP. A post on &quot;The Little Wheel Goes in Back&quot; blog, written by one of the developers, on August 23, 2007, suggested the working title was &quot;Train Simulator 2&quot;.

== Open Rails ==
MSTS is compatible with the open source project &quot;Open Rails&quot;, created by followers of MSTS, which hosts a collection of third party digital content. MSTS&#x27;s development ended in 2009; however, community support for MSTS led to the creation of a third party team which created Open Rails.

Open Rails uses the GPL license, and the project has progressed from providing legacy support for MSTS to adding new features. Open Rails supports modern graphics processors, which allows it to achieve increased frame rates compared to MSTS.

A form of Open Rails was used in several studies about the real life operation of railroads, such as in a 2016 study analyzing the impact of cyber attacks on railroads.

==Community==
TrainSim.Com was the first community to embrace MSTS in 2001, and has an active support community as well as a file library of user created content for the game. Over 50,000 files ranging from entire routes to individual locomotives and cars are available to use with the legacy MSTS game and with Open Rails. As of August 2024, new content is still being developed for the game.

Additional communities, such as UK TrainSim, also emerged, however many of these have since closed down.

<text>The minister of justice and attorney general of Canada () is a dual-role portfolio in the Canadian Cabinet. 

The officeholder in the role of Minister of Justice () serves as the minister of the Crown responsible for the Department of Justice and the justice portfolio, and in the role of Attorney General (), litigates on behalf of the Crown and serves as the chief legal advisor to the Government of Canada. (Though most prosecution functions of the attorney general have been assigned to the Public Prosecution Service of Canada. The attorney general is supported in this role by the director of public prosecutions.)

==Attorney General of Canada==

The role was created in 1867 to replace the attorney general of Canada West and attorney general of Canada East.

As the top prosecuting officer in Canada, &#x27;attorney general&#x27; is a separate title held by the minister of justice—a member of the Cabinet. The minister of justice is concerned with questions of policy and their relationship to the justice system. In their role as attorney general, they are the chief law officer of the Crown. The roles have been connected since confederation. As a result of controversy, following the SNC-Lavalin affair, Anne McLellan was appointed to review the roles and prepare a report on whether they should be separated. She recommended the positions remain combined.

This cabinet position is usually reserved for someone holding a legal qualification. There have been exceptions: Joe Clark only studied the first year of law at Dalhousie University before transferring to University of British Columbia Faculty of Law and dropping out to embark on political life.

This cabinet portfolio has been held by many individuals who went on to become prime minister including John Sparrow David Thompson, R. B. Bennett, Louis St Laurent, Pierre Elliott Trudeau, John Turner, Kim Campbell and Jean Chrétien (Clark became MoJAG after his time as prime minister). This is the only Canadian Ministry (other than that of the prime minister) which has not been reorganized since its creation in 1867.

A separate cabinet position, the minister of public safety (formerly known as the &quot;solicitor general&quot;) administers the law enforcement agencies (police, prisons, and security) of the federal government.

<doc id="621307" wikidata="Q387746" url="?curid=621307" title="Trainz">
<text>Trainz is a series of 3D train simulator video games. The Australian studio Auran (since 2007 N3V Games) released the first game in 2001.

The simulators consist of route and session editors called &quot;Surveyor&quot;, and a &quot;Driver&quot; module that loads a route and lets the player operate and watch the trains run in either &quot;DCC&quot; mode, which simulates a bare-bones Digital Command Control (DCC) system for the simple stop-and-go of a basic model railway, or &quot;CAB&quot; mode, which simulates real-world physics and adds working cab controls.

The games emphasize themselves on inclusion of content, and all subsequent games following &quot;Trainz Community Edition&quot; would allow users to install 3rd-party rolling stock, scenery, routes, and other content under the .CDP file type. 

==Overview==
In the route editor, Surveyor, the user can shape the landscape, paint with ground textures, lay tracks, and place buildings and roads. The user then operates the trains in Driver, either in free play, or according to a scenario called a &quot;Driver Session&quot; (previously called &quot;Scenarios&quot; in the early versions of &quot;Trainz&quot;, &quot;Ultimate Trainz Collection&quot;, and &quot;TRS2004&quot;) which can range in difficulty from beginner to expert. In CAB (cabin) mode the train physics are more sophisticated than in DCC mode; adding real-life considerations such as wheel slip on the rails; how the weight of the consist slows acceleration and deceleration. Any train can be given directions to be driven by the computer.
===Other software===
The simulators are supported by a large library of freeware assets which can be downloaded from the N3V servers, referred to as the Download Station (DLS). Unless users purchase a First Class Ticket with real money, download speeds for the DLS (both in Content Manager and directly through File Transfer Protocol on the Trainz website) are throttled, which tends to be a point of contention in the Trainz community. PaintShed is a simple program for aiding and easing the process of &#x27;reskinning&#x27; traincars, altering their livery, by recoloring and adding new heraldry to &quot;Trainz&quot; locomotives and other rolling stock. The &quot;Content Manager&quot; (CM) module is a Windows program that allows management of the in-game database files. It was renamed under the name of &quot;Content Manager Plus&quot; (CMP) in &quot;TRS2006&quot;.

&quot;Trainz&quot; rolling stock assets were also used in a &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; expansion pack dubbed the &quot;Regional Add-On Pack&quot;, which allowed users to drive locomotives used in Trainz in MSTS maps, with some locomotives being unused in the former altogether, such as an ATSF Dash 9, UP DD40AX, and a Penn Central GG1. Another add-on, &quot;MSTS Paintshed&quot;, was basically a reskinned version of the Trainz Paintshed module, which allowed users to make reskins of the same templates found in Trainz Paintshed, and export them to MSTS. Both of these add-on releases were created by N3V, originally Auran at the time.

==Games==

===&quot;Trainz&quot;===

The first ever version of &quot;Trainz&quot; originally started life as a set of downloadable files in 2000, eventually becoming &quot;Trainz 0.9&quot;, which was a CD-ROM beta that was mailed to testers by Auran. 

&quot;Trainz Community Edition&quot; was released in December 2001, with Service packs 1 (April), 2 (June) and 3 (November) being released in 2002, in which they progressively updated the &quot;Community Edition, Trainz 1.0&quot;, to versions 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 successively. Two retail builds (retail versions releases) existed; the English/USA version is commonly known as &quot;Trainz 1.0&quot;.

&quot;Trainz Retail Edition&quot; was released in June 2002 aimed at the United States and other North American markets.
Service pack 3 was released in November 2002, this updated both the &quot;Community and Retail Editions&quot; to version 1.3. Thus all USA versions are commonly known as &quot;Trainz 1.3&quot;.
The &quot;Ultimate Trainz Collection&quot;, or &quot;UTC&quot;, was released on 26 November 2002 in North America as a 3-CD set including extra rolling stock, and a CD-ROM with TrainzScript-based scenarios and route map content based on Trainz 1.3 tech. This was the first edition to include the formerly separately retailed PaintShed program and support RailDriver, as well as the first incorporating Trainz user developed freeware content as part of the release, some of which became Trainz staple content in TRS2004 et al. through current releases.

==== Special hardware support ====
The desktop cab controller RailDriver was first supported for use in Service Pack 1 for the &quot;Ultimate Trainz Collection&quot;, and is also supported by all subsequent &quot;Trainz&quot; releases.

===&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004&quot;===

&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004&quot; (known as &quot;Trainz Railway Simulator 2004&quot; in the United Kingdom), or
&quot;TRS2004&quot;, was released in September 2003. &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004&quot; incorporated a load of technical changes and these required many bug fixes that were released as four service packs throughout 2004 and 2005.

&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004&quot; was the first version of &quot;Trainz&quot; to include interactive industries and loadable rolling stock capabilities, which allow the player to deliver various resources (such as coal, wood, and steel) and passengers to various industries and stations across the playable area. There were many industries included and much of the bundled rolling stock was updated to include this new dynamic loading and unloading animated capability with a corresponding load-state dynamic driving physics change in the handling of a consist. It was also the first version of the &quot;Trainz&quot; series to have built-in steam engines.

&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004 Deluxe&quot; was a later 4 CDROM follow on with the first two service packs pre-installed. It also included PaintShed, and a bonus content CD.

This edition was also the first to support downloadable fan-made content, such as characters, buildings and scenery from the popular &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; franchise, which has since seen the birth of a massive community on YouTube involving users recreating episodes of the series using &quot;Trainz&quot; or creating their own original stories.

===&quot;Trainz Railway Simulator 2006&quot;===

&quot;Trainz Railway Simulator 2006&quot; (known as &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006&quot; in the USA), or &quot;TRS2006&quot;, was a transitional release, incorporating the stable Auran JET based TRS2004 GUI modules with only some graphics improvements, but introducing the data base manager Content Manager Plus (CMP) as a new core technology. ContentManager.exe (now called just CM) combines data base management, and secure FTP upload and download facilities and special user definable filters all in one integrated system. By defining a good filter, the user could&quot; &#x27;selectively not see&#x27; &quot;the clutter of regional items in the Surveyor asset selection menus saving user time when world building. This important filtering feature was further improved in Trainz 2009, becoming far more powerful and easier to use. In addition to these improvements, several new routes were included, such as Hawes Junction (representing a small section of the Settle and Carlisle Railway and serving as a demo for TC3), Toronto Rail Lands 1954 (representing Toronto&#x27;s sprawling railyard in 1954), and Marias Pass Approach (representing the BNSF Marias Pass line between Shelby, Montana and Cut Bank, Montana and serving as a demo for the full Marias Pass payware route). TRS2006 was published in September 2005, and the base release with its single service pack formed the core of the regional releases (most are joint ventures with &#x27;Trainz Partners&#x27; combining payware content provider&#x27;s products with the base Trainz software) over the next four years until the introduction of new technologies in TC3 and TRS2009. In Germany, it was published by Bluesky-Interactive, as &quot;ProTrain Perfect&quot;.

====&quot;Trainz Driver&quot;====

&quot;Trainz Driver&quot; (also known as &quot;Trainz Driver Edition (TDE)&quot; in the USA) is a version of &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006&quot; released in 2005 lacking the Content Manager and Surveyor GUI world building module, having only the Driver and Railyard modules. Note this is precisely the formula utilized with the 2011-2016 release of iPhone and iPad based Trainz releases, as well as the new &#x27;Driver 2016&#x27;.
* The package includes three large routes with 21 driver sessions, all set in North America. &quot;Trainz Driver&quot; is the first instance when Auran turned to blatant marketing measures to boost sales. Current CEO Tony Hilliam had taken on an increasing role in company management beginning in 2005, and by 2008 would end up a principle investor in Auran with rights to develop and distribute the Trainz franchise.
* Over the same three-year period, Auran licensed eight separate&quot; &#x27;Regional releases&#x27; &quot;based on the stable JET2 (TRS2004/TRS2006) game engine releases aimed at opening new market niches. These versions had few game improvements, and Driver and Surveyor were technically equivalent to The TRS2004-TRS2006 games, albeit, given new skins and better graphics interfacing. Prior to those releases, if you had a high end graphics system, to let the game know about your superior hardware you had to edit an ini file called TrainzOptions.txt with apropos height and width entries.

====&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2007&quot;====

&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2007&quot; (abbreviated as &quot;TRS2007&quot;) was the second release targeting a regional market distributed by Anuman Interactive for sale in France, Belgium and Switzerland. There were initially two versions: the standard version which consisted of &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006&quot; with Service Pack 1 applied, and the &quot;Gold&quot; edition, which included French regional add-on items.
  Halycon Media later distributed &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2007&quot; with German region-specific content for the British, Austrian, and Swiss market. This release version of &quot;TRS2007&quot; was not available in American markets, though the &quot;Gold&quot; edition content was included in later games.

====&quot;Trainz Classics (TC1—TC3)&quot;====

&quot;Trainz Classics&quot;, also abbreviated as &quot;TC&quot; (TC1, TC2, TC3), is a series of 3 standalone &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006&quot; joint venture customizations put together by Auran and different professional providers of third party content. Unlike typical Trainz releases which feature a round-the-world sampling of content typical to different regions of the planet, the Trainz Classics versions feature a large railroad layout with plenty of special professionally written sessions exploiting the featured railroad. Trainz Classics 3 renewed evolution of the Trainz base technologies incorporating various changes to the older stable four-year-old data models resulting in the publication of a new .pdf file TC3 Content Creator&#x27;s Guide.

TC1 focuses on the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line in the 2000s (due to EMD FL9 locomotives still being in service), TC2 focuses on a freelanced city called &quot;Modula City&quot;, featuring European trams running in the city and to an island (a demo version was included with TRS2004). TC3 focuses on the famed Settle-Carlisle Line from Skipton to Carlisle in the late 1950s/early 1960s during the steam-diesel transition.

Demos of Modula City and the Settle-Carlisle line were included in &quot;TRS2006&quot;, along with a limited amount of content in unrefined states.

The content from Trainz Classics 1 and 2 were later released as built-content for TS2009 and TS2010, and can be downloaded from the DLS for all future games. Trainz Classics 3 was re-released as an expansion pack for all subsequent games as the &quot;Settle &amp; Carlisle Route,&quot; with extra content added from the original release (some of the Mark 1 coaches in BR Blue were also included by default in these versions due to being used in the consists of trains on the built-in East Coast Main Line routes).

;TRS2008
A version of Trainz Classics which included regional French content and staple content from previous games was also published by Anuman Interactive. This version of Trainz was built on the Trainz Classics interface which later paved the way for future Trainz releases.

====&quot;Trainz – The Complete Collection&quot;====
Released 13 June 2008. This is a large compilation, containing three DVD&#x27;s: &quot;Ultimate Trainz Collection&quot;, &quot;TRS2004&quot;, &quot;TRS2006&quot;, &quot;Trainz Routes&quot; (volumes 1–4), and &quot;Trainz PaintShed&quot;.

====&quot;Trainz Simulator 2009: World Builder Edition&quot;====
Released in 2008, &quot;Trainz Simulator 2009&quot; received the &quot;World Builder Edition&quot; name from its greatly improved Surveyor and graphics capabilities such as better terrain tools, quad detail and normal-mapped terrain, new stitched track modelling technique, a large collection of stock assets, and performance improvements to allow for higher detail trains, terrain, textures, and routes. It also introduced improved physics, Content Manager v2.0, new screenshot and video capture functions, user interface improvements, and an embedded web browser for easier community interaction.

====&quot;Trainz Simulator 2010: Engineer’s Edition&quot;====
&quot;Trainz Simulator 2010,&quot; or &quot;TS2010&quot;, introduced improved graphics capabilities, Speedtree technology, an overhauled user interface, seasonal assets, and layer support in Surveyor. &quot;TS2010&quot; also introduced Native Mode, which allowed the game to harness new 64-bit processing, while retaining a Compatibility Mode for older 32-bit computer architectures and better performance with older routes and assets marked as &quot;Faulty&quot; due to stricter code enforcement..

Service Pack 4 introduced an early version of multiplayer, but also controversially removed Compatibility Mode.

===&quot;Trainz Simulator&quot;: iPad, Android===
To celebrate the 10th anniversary of &quot;Trainz&quot;, N3V Games released a &quot;Trainz&quot; app for the iPad on 4 December 2010. Users can lay tracks, drive trains. Users have access to Driver and Surveyor and can create routes and drive trains with the help of tutorials. An Android version of the game was released on 22 July 2011 and has the same features as the iPad version. The app is a port of &quot;Trainz Simulator 2009&quot;.

===&quot;Trainz Simulator 12&quot;===

&quot;Trainz Simulator 12&quot;, or &quot;TS12&quot;, was released on 12 April 2011. Among other upgrades, this product offers a variety of new routes, doppler effect support, satellite view, and a multiplayer feature for the first time (multiplayer was publicly tested in &quot;TS2010 SP4&quot;). A Trainz 10th Anniversary Boxset was announced which includes the game and other extras. The game was initially released for pre-order on 18 March 2011 as part of the limited-edition &quot;Trainz 10th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition&quot;. A certain amount of content from previous versions was removed from this release, making it the first release since Trainz 1.0 to feature all and only new routes and related assets. Like most Trainz releases, the package contains only content vetted for the new technology, which in TS12 needed to be updated for compatibility with 64 bit computers. However, much of the content (not all of it) from the previous versions was released on the Download Station (DLS) in an updated form as of the end of 2012 under an initiative known as the &quot;Download Station Cleanup&quot;.

===&quot;My First Trainz Set&quot;===
&quot;My First Trainz Set&quot; was designed for the younger generation who do not want to worry about realism or management when playing the &quot;Trainz&quot; game. The game features 4 locations to lay track in that are based on rooms throughout a house, such as a bedroom or kitchen. The user has the ability to place down small toy-like objects in the replacement of buildings and scenery. However, its graphical quality of the trains, track, and objects is still very much like that of the standard &quot;Trainz&quot; simulator games. Controls are also far more simplified. The game was also ported to Android devices.

===&quot;Trainz Simulator: Mac&quot;===
&quot;Trainz Simulator: Mac&quot; was a port of &quot;Trainz Simulator 2010&quot; for the Mac.

===&quot;Trainz Driver&quot;: iPhone===
&quot;Trainz Driver&quot; leveraged the work done porting Trainz Simulator onto iPad and brought the driving aspect of the Trainz franchise to mobile phones for the first time.

===&quot;Trainz Simulator 2 Mac&quot;===
&quot;Trainz Simulator 2 Mac&quot; was released on 27 March 2014 via the Mac App Store, which amongst other things, introduced an online multiplayer feature. It is a port of &quot;Trainz 12&quot;.

===&quot;Trainz Driver 2&quot;: iPhone===

&quot;Trainz Driver 2&quot; leveraged the iPad updates and introduced the powerful route editing tools to the phone. It has &quot;TS2009&quot;’s game engine built into it.

===&quot;Trainz: A New Era&quot;===
&quot;Trainz: A New Era&quot; is, as noted in the new naming convention, a new beginning for the Trainz franchise. In November 2013, a Kickstarter campaign for the game was launched to help fund the game and the new purpose-built game engine. The campaign reached its target funding level a month later. Contributors were awarded prizes ranging from desktop wallpapers, First Class Tickets for the Download Station, full copies of the game, and various additional content depending on the amount pledged. 
* The game utilizes a new custom designed 64 bit game engine, which features far more realistic (lifelike) graphics, slightly improved train physics, and various other new features and improvements led by a top ten hit-list drawn up by the user community on the forums between September and November 2013.
* Subsequently, a download only release, &quot;the &#x27;TANE Community Edition&#x27; &quot;was released in mid-December 2014. The new game was officially released as a retail version for wide distribution on 15 May 2015, though it was rather bare bones, lacking many normal User Interface features such as Content Manager hotkeys, a working minimap and like UX multiplier factors.
* A whole series of bug fixing hotfix software updates were released throughout the year, and often these would incrementally improve UI lacks and so gradually raise the UX. On 12 January 2016, the long delayed Service Pack 1, which had finally passed a succession of hurdles, was released, heralding a new stage of stability and capability. Major Kickstarter contributors also could participate in Beta testing in addition to a dedicated in-house employee team testing new code, so hundreds participated in moving the new technology into matured stability. Two hotfixes followed after just a month and a half, one after the other a week apart on 11 March 2016 (build 81190) and 18 March 2016 (build 81296), but normal UI to recapture UX operations of earlier Trainz versions aside from Driver were still lacking in hotfix2. Several of the CM hotkeys were reinstated with the second hotfix, and N3V announced that Service Pack 2 beta candidate builds would be coming soon, implying the rapid rebuilding of the Trainz customary UX may not be far behind. On 16 June 2017, SP2 was finally released and introduced over 1,000 individual fixes and updates. A little over a year later, SP3 was released on 11 July 2018 and included many bug fixes and improvements to AI, Multiplayer, stability, and performance.

=== &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019&quot; ===
On 11 May 2018, N3V Games announced a new version of Trainz featuring better graphics, Physically-Based Rendering, Parallax Occlusion Mapping and more content than ever before. Early Access was released in July 2018 and the game was officially launched 7 January 2019. It is also the first entry in the series since TRS2006 to feature the &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator&quot; moniker, possibly to avoid confusion with &quot;Train Simulator&quot; by Dovetail Games. The game uses whole-game DRM in all versions, whereas certain versions of &quot;Trainz: A New Era&quot; could be purchased and run offline. This requires that the game is connected to the internet at least once a month in order for the game and content to continue functioning. TRS19 was primarily offered as subscription model, although a one-time purchase (but with the monthly DRM check still required) is also available via the Trainz Store and Steam. It also has the ability to download content from the Download Station (DLS) while in the game; though without the purchase of so-called &quot;first class tickets&quot; (limited-duration speed upgrades) the download speed is severely throttled.

==== Full Editions ====
There are two editions offered:
* Standard Edition - The baseline version, which includes six routes: Kickstarter County 2 (an updated version of the Kickstarter County route from T:ANE), Canadian Rockies - Golden, BC (featuring the Canadian Pacific Mountain and Wildemere subdivisions, on which the Rocky Mountaineer runs), Sebino Lake, Italy (representing the Ferrovienord line from Brescia to Pisogne in the 1980s), Niddertalbahn (representing Main-Weser-Bahn from Bad Vilbel to Stockheim), Edinburgh-Dundee (representing the East Coast Main Line from Edinburgh Waverley to Dundee in 1976, serving as an extension of the main ECML route from King&#x27;s Cross to Edinburgh in T:ANE), and Cornish Mainline and Branchlines (representing the Cornish Main Line and its associated branchlines just after the formation of British Railways in 1948)
* Platinum Edition - This includes everything in the Standard Edition plus unified camera and surveyor options, and an additional content bundle

==== Regional Editions ====
2019 saw the release of regional versions, with content (routes, locomotives, etc.) specific to certain parts of the world (and only those parts):
* World Edition - Containing all six routes and related content, this is a new name for the standard edition
* North American Edition - Only comes with Kickstarter County 2 and Golden, BC
* United Kingdom Edition - Only comes with Kickstarter County 2, Edinburgh-Dundee, and Cornish Mainline and Branchlines
* European Edition - Only comes with Kickstarter County 2, Niddertalbahn, and Sebino Lake, Italy

===&quot;Trainz Simulator 3&quot;: Mobile===
A port of &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2019&quot; for mobile devices was released around August 2021. The game currently comes with 4 routes, one of them being based on a fictional high-speed line in Sweden used by the ETR 1000, an Italian high-speed train. The line is most likely based on the Swedish SJ X2000 high-speed trainset used between Copenhagen and major cities in Sweden such as Stockholm, Malmö or Göteborg. Another route involves the Rocky Mountains featuring the Rocky Mountaineer, and some CSX freighters. Despite the game not having a route based in China, there are Chinese trains available for purchase such as the SS4, an electric locomotive used for cargo operations Despite being able to place trains onto the map, the game does not contain a Surveyor mode.
The latest DLC is the SR &quot;Schools&quot; model. It was released on September 27, 2024.

=== &quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2022&quot; ===
The next major release of Trainz was announced in November 2021, with preorders starting on 9 December. An Early Access edition was released on 11 February 2022 and the game was officially launched on 31 May 2022.

New features include Multiplayer Surveyor (tested in TRS2019 closed betas), the unification of Driver and Surveyor to allow seamless switching between the two, a total overhaul of the Surveyor called Surveyor 2.0, new effect layer tools and presets, the ability to bulk paint textures under splines, new camera options beyond the original four (including Walk, Car, Fly, and Drone), an in-game content store, and support for game controllers. Features exclusive to subscribers include HD Terrain, which adds 1600x more data density to manipulate and texture the terrain, and Trainz Living Railroad, a system that completely automates freight and passenger operations.

==== Full Editions ====
There are two editions offered:
* Standard Edition - The baseline version, which includes six routes: Kickstarter County 2, West from Denver (representing the Union Pacific mainline from Denver to Hot Sulphur Springs, Colorado), Schwäninger Land (a freelance route set in modern Germany), Liskeard to Looe (representing the Looe Valley Line in Cornwall from the Privatisation of British Rail to modern Great Western Railway operations), Bairnsdale to Orbost (representing the Gippsland railway line in the 1970s), and Beloreck - South Ural Mountains (representing the South Urals Railway)
* Platinum Edition - This includes everything in the Standard Edition plus Surveyor 2.0 and a content bundle including 5 new routes and over 400 new locomotives, cars, and wagons

==== Subscriptions ====

A different way of purchasing Trainz is by paying a monthly or annual subscription. This gives you access to the game and extra perks as long as you remain a subscriber.
* Trainz Plus Standard - This gives you access to the standard game, early access to new features and pre-release content, and accelerated downloads (&quot;first class ticket&quot;)
* Trainz Plus Gold - In addition to the Standard tier, you get extra promotional features and gain free access to all DLC

=== &quot;Trainz Simulator: World Tour&quot; ===
In December 2024, N3V announced a console port of Trainz for a 2025 release. The trailer received backlash for usage of AI in marketing and was later reworked and reuploaded.

=== Technical support ===
All games of the &quot;Trainz&quot; series have a support schedule which is described on the official wiki page. According to the document, game support includes following features:

* Product-specific information, downloads, and utilities on the N3V Games web site.
* Product assistance through the N3V Games Helpdesk.
* Maintenance of product-specific forums.
* Access to the Download Station.
* Access to upload content to the Download Station
* Access to the iTrainz network.
* Access to other product-specific network services.

==== Versioning of game engine and assets ====
The &quot;Trainz&quot; game series has a complicated versioning scheme for game engine and assets. Game builds are listed on a special wiki page and game engine versions are listed separately. All the assets created in an editor store a version number of the game engine used to create them. In many cases assets created in earlier versions of game have compatibility with game engine of newer versions.

==== Official Wiki website ====
The &quot;Trainz&quot; game series has its own official wiki website. Despite the old domain name, this site is an official wiki website of the whole &quot;Trainz&quot; project. &quot;This wiki is created by both N3VGames (the developers behind Trainz) and by the Trainz Community (requires a Planet Auran login and registered Trainz product to gain edit rights).&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Trainz&quot; was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Simulation on PC&quot; award in 2002.

&quot;Trainz Railroad Simulator 2004&quot; was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; &quot;Computer Simulation Game of the Year&quot; award in 2004.

<text>A train simulator (also railroad simulator or railway simulator) is a computer-based simulation of rail transport operations. They are generally large complicated software packages modeling a 3D virtual reality world implemented both as commercial trainers, and consumer computer game software with &#x27;play modes&#x27; which lets the user interact by stepping inside the virtual world. Because of the near view modeling, often at speed, train simulator software is generally far more complicated software to write and implement than flight simulator programs.

==Industrial train simulations==

Like flight simulators, train simulators have been produced for railway training purposes. Driver simulators include those produced by:
* Avansim, based in the UK and Germany
* Transurb Simulation, a Belgian-based company
* FAAC (the training division of Arotech Corporation) in the United States 
* Ongakukan in Japan
* EADS in Germany
* Bentley Systems in the UK
* Lander Simulation &amp; Training Solutions, Spain
* CORYS, a French company with offices in Grenoble, France and Jacksonville, FL, USA
* Krauss-Maffei Wegmann GmbH &amp; Co KG (KMW), a German company based in Munich
* Oktal Sydac in Australia, France, India and the UK
* SMART Simulation - part of the Neokon Baltija group from Lithuania with offices in the UK and Russia.
* New York Air Brake, an American company based in Watertown, NY.
* PS Technology, an American company based in Boulder, CO.
* Zusi 3 Professional, a German Professional Software to train and educate train drivers. (There is even a hobby version for the community.) The possible routes in the simulator can go mainly through Germany, but also Austria, little Italy and some French.

Signaller training simulators have been developed by Funkwerk in Germany, The Railway Engineering Company (TRE) in the UK, OpenTrack Railway Technology in Switzerland, and PS Technology in the US.

== Types of train simulators ==
There are various types of train driving simulators that are adapted to varying training needs and can be combined to meet operators&#x27; training needs in the most efficient way.

=== Full-cabin simulators ===
Similarly to flight simulators, train simulators can be a replica of a full driving cabin, on a one-to-one scale. This type of simulator is opted for when a train operator needs an immersive training tool for particularly effective training sessions.

=== Intermediate, more compact simulators ===
Certain simulators can uphold a certain level of immersion while optimising the space of a training room. When a certain balance between immersion and scalability is needed, this type of simulator is chosen by instructors.

=== Portable simulators ===
When a train operator has various training centres, it is sometimes easier and more logical to invest in smaller simulators that can be transported from one centre to another. The company Transurb Simulation was the first to propose such a tool, which has now been adopted by many operators around the world and is becoming of a growing interest for smaller operators.

== Consumer train simulation ==
Many consumer train simulations have been produced, often focusing on different aspects of real-life railways.

===Driving simulation===
Train driving simulation games usually allow a user to have a &quot;driver&#x27;s view&quot; from the locomotive&#x27;s cab and operate realistic cab controls such as throttle, brake valve, sand, horn and whistle, lights etc.

Train driving simulation software includes:
* &quot;BVE Trainsim&quot; (originally &quot;Boso View Express&quot;) is a Japanese three-dimensional computer-based train simulator. It is notable for focusing on providing an accurate driving experience as viewed from inside the cab, rather than creating a network of other trains—There are no outside views, drivers can only look directly ahead, and other trains passed along the route are only displayed as stationary objects.
* &quot;Densha de Go!&quot;, a Japanese train simulation game series focused on driving, developed by Taito.
* &quot;Diesel Railcar Simulator&quot;, a train simulator focusing on British diesel-mechanical railcars.
* &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; (&quot;MSTS&quot;), developed by Kuju Entertainment.
** Open Rails, an open source, freeware simulator that is backwards compatible with Microsoft Train Simulator content.
* &quot;Rail Simulator&quot;, a spiritual successor to &quot;MSTS&quot; also developed by Kuju Entertainment.
* &quot;Train Simulator&quot; (originally &quot;RailWorks&quot;), a successor to &quot;Rail Simulator&quot; created when a new company, Rail Simulator Developments Ltd, purchased the rights. In 2013 RSDL rebranded themselves as Dovetail Games, and renamed &quot;Railworks&quot; to simply &quot;Train Simulator&quot;.
** &quot;Train Sim World&quot;, a successor to the above developed by Dovetail Games using the Unreal Engine.
* &quot;Run8&quot;, a primarily multiplayer train simulator focused on realistic North American freight operations.
* &quot;Train Simulator&quot; series (a.k.a. &quot;Railfan&quot;)
* &quot;Trainz&quot;
* &quot;Zusi 3 Hobby&quot;, an offshoot of the professional version with the identical programme versions, with real tracks recreated by the community. Actual existing Train Network on this map in light green, but is regularly updated to bigger networks. 
* &quot;Mechanik EN57&quot; and &quot;MaSzyna&quot;, freeware train simulators mainly focusing on Polish mainline rolling stock.
* Train Sim, a mobile phone Train Simulator developed by 3583 Bytes using the Unity Engine.

The PC game &quot;3D Ultra Lionel Traintown&quot;, amongst some others, give a different experience to driving, by being in a 3rd person omniscient perspective, controlling the trains from a bird&#x27;s eye view.

Peripherals specifically designed for use with driving simulations include RailDriver by US manufacturer P.I. Engineering. RailDriver is a programmable desktop cab controller with throttle, brake lever and switches designed to work with &quot;Trainz&quot;, &quot;TrainMaster&quot;, &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; and &quot;Rail Simulator. There are also numerous Rail simulators on Roblox such as Stepford County Railway and British Railway.&quot;

===Strategy simulation===
Railroad-themed strategy simulation video games are focused mostly on the economic part of the railroad industry rather than on technical detail. The &quot;A-Train&quot; series (1985 to present) is an early example. Chris Sawyer&#x27;s &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot; (1994) was an influential game in this genre, spawning remakes such as &quot;Simutrans&quot; (1999 to present), &quot;OpenTTD&quot; (2004 to present) and Sawyer&#x27;s own &quot;Locomotion&quot; (2004). Sid Meier designed two railroad simulations: &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; (1990) and &quot;Railroads!&quot; (2006). The &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; series itself inspired other rail games such as &quot;Rails Across America&quot; (2001).

===Other genres===
Some rail simulation games focus on railway signalling rather than driving or economics. Examples include &quot;The Train Game&quot; (1983), &quot;SimSig&quot;, &quot;JBSS BAHN&quot;, &quot;Train Dispatcher&quot;, and the series of signalling simulations produced by PC-Rail Software.

==History==
Train simulators are particularly popular in Japan, where rail transport is the primary form of travel for most citizens. Train video games have been developed in Japan since the early 1980s, with Sega&#x27;s arcade action game &quot;Super Locomotive&quot; (1982) being an early example, before more realistic train simulators emerged, such as Ongakukan&#x27;s &quot;Train Simulator&quot; series (1995 debut) and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Densha de Go&quot; series (1996 debut), as well as train business simulations such as the &quot;A-Train&quot; series (1985 debut). Non-commercial Japanese sims include the freeware BVE, first released in 1996, which was later remade as the free and open-source &quot;OpenBVE&quot;.

One of the first commercially available train simulators in the West was &quot;Southern Belle&quot;, released in 1985. The game simulated a journey of the &quot;Southern Belle&quot; steam passenger train from London Victoria to Brighton, while at the same time the player must comply with speed limits, not to go too fast on curves and keep to the schedule. It was followed with &quot;Evening Star&quot; in 1987. The first two train simulators to achieve large sales in the West, &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; and &quot;Trainz&quot;, arrived within a few months of one another in 2001. These featured differing design philosophies - &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot; focused on providing a realistic driving experience, whereas &quot;Trainz&quot; focused more on the ability of the user to create their own content such as trains and routes.

The developers behind &quot;Microsoft Train Simulator&quot;, Kuju Entertainment, later released a spiritual successor called &quot;Rail Simulator&quot;, which was later purchased by a separate company and rereleased as &quot;Railworks&quot;.

<text>A lever action is a type of action for repeating firearms that uses a manually operated cocking handle located around the trigger guard area (often incorporating it) that pivots forward to move the bolt via internal linkages, which will feed and extract cartridges into and out of the chamber, and cock the firing pin mechanism. This contrasts to other type of repeating actions such as the bolt-action, pump-action, semi-automatic, fully automatic, and/or burst mode actions. A firearm using this operating mechanism is colloquially referred to as a levergun.

Most lever-action firearms are rifles, but some lever-action shotguns and a few pistols have been made. The Winchester Model 1873 rifle is one of the most famous lever-action firearms, but many manufacturers (notably Henry and Marlin) also produce lever-action rifles. Colt produced the 6403 lever-action Colt-Burgess rifles from 1883 until 1885 and Mossberg formerly produced the Model 464 rifle.

==History==
In 1826, a lever-action revolver was capable of firing six shots in less than six seconds. It was produced in Italy by Cesar Rosaglio and patented in 1829.

The first lever-action rifles on the market were likely the Colt&#x27;s 1st and 2nd model ring lever rifles, both cap and ball rifles, produced by the Patent Arms Mfg. Co. Paterson, N.J.-Colt&#x27;s Patent between 1837 and 1841. The ring lever was located in front of the trigger. This loading lever, when pulled, would index the cylinder to the next position and cock the internal hidden hammer.

Multiple lever-action designs, including the Volcanic pistol, were designed before the American Civil War, but the first significant designs were the Spencer repeating rifle and Henry rifle, both created in 1860. The Spencer was a lever-operated rifle with a removable seven-round tube magazine, designed by Christopher Spencer. Over 20,000 were made, and it was adopted by the United States and used during the American Civil War, which marked the first adoption of an infantry and cavalry rifle with a removable magazine by any country. The early Spencer&#x27;s rifle lever only served to unlock the action and chamber a new round; the hammer had to be cocked separately after chambering.

The Henry rifle, invented by Benjamin Tyler Henry, had a centrally located hammer, cocked by the rearward movement of the bolt rather than an offset hammer typical of muzzle-loading rifles. Henry placed the magazine under the barrel rather than in the buttstock, an idea copied by most designers since.

John Marlin, founder of Marlin Firearms Company, introduced the company&#x27;s first lever-action repeating rifle, the Model 1881. This was chambered in rounds such as .45-70 Government and .38-55 Winchester. Its successor was the 1895 solid-top design, known as the Marlin 336 today. It gave rise to the Model 1894, which is still in production.

By the 1890s, lever actions had evolved into a form that would last for over a century. Both Marlin and Winchester released new model lever-action rifles in 1894. The Marlin rifle is still in production, whereas production of the Winchester 94 ceased in 2006. While externally similar, the Marlin and Winchester rifles are different internally. The Marlin has a single-stage lever action, while the Winchester has a double-stage lever. The double-stage action is easily seen when the Winchester&#x27;s lever is operated, as the entire trigger group drops down to unlock the bolt which then moves rearward to eject the spent cartridge.

The fledgling Savage Arms Company became well known after the development of its popular hammerless Models 1895 and 1899 (which became the Model 99) lever-action sporting rifles. The Models 1895 and 1899 were produced from their introduction in 1899 until the expense of producing the rifle and declining interest in lever-action rifles resulted in dropping the Model 99 from production in 1998.

Sturm, Ruger &amp; Co introduced a number of new lever-action designs in the 1990s.

== Use in warfare ==

The Henry Lever-Action was used in the US Civil War and was used in the US until the Winchester Model 1866 rifle replaced it. The Spencer repeating rifle was also used in the US Civil War. Additionally, rifles using the lever-action design were used extensively during the 1930s by irregular forces in the Spanish Civil War. Typically, these were Winchesters or Winchester copies of Spanish manufacture. At least 9,000 Model 1895 rifles are known to have been provided by the Soviet Union in 1936 to the Spanish Republicans for use in the Spanish Civil War. Both the Russian Empire and the United States adopted the Winchester Model 1895 as a military weapon.

=== Shotguns ===
Early attempts at repeating shotguns invariably centered around either bolt-action or lever-action designs, drawing obvious inspiration from the repeating rifles of the time. The earliest successful repeating shotgun was the lever-action Winchester Model 1887, designed by John Browning in 1885 at the behest of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company. The lever-action design was chosen for reasons of brand recognition despite the protestations of Browning, who pointed out that a slide-action design would be much better for a shotgun. Initially chambered for black powder shotgun shells (as was standard at the time), the Model 1887 gave rise to the Winchester Model 1901, a strengthened version chambered for 10ga smokeless powder shells. Their popularity waned after the introduction of slide-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1897, and production was discontinued in 1920. Modern reproductions are manufactured by Armi Chiappa in Italy, Norinco in China, and ADI Ltd. in Australia. Winchester continued to manufacture the .410 bore Winchester Model 1894 (Model 9410) from 2003 until 2006.

Australian firearm laws strictly control pump-action shotguns and semi-automatic actions (Category C, D &amp; R). Lever-action operation falls into a more lenient category (Category A &amp; B), which has led to an increase in popularity of lever action shotguns.

=== Other applications ===
A one-off example of lever-action reloading on automatic firearms is the M1895 Colt–Browning machine gun. This weapon had a swinging lever beneath its barrel that was actuated by a gas bleed in the barrel, unlocking the breech to reload. This unique operation gave the nickname &quot;potato digger&quot;, as the lever swung each time the weapon fired and would dig into the ground if the weapon was not situated high enough on its mount.

== Cartridges ==

The cartridges for lever-action rifles have a wide variety of calibers, bullet shapes, and powder loads which fall into two categories: low-pressure cartridges with rounded bullets, and high-pressure cartridges with aerodynamic pointed (&quot;spitzer&quot;) bullets.

Some lever-actions are not as strong as bolt action or semi-automatic rifle actions. The weaker actions utilize low- and medium-pressure cartridges, somewhat similar to high-powered pistol ammunition. To increase the bullet&#x27;s energy at relatively low velocities, these often have larger, heavier bullets than other types of rifles. The most common cartridge is the .30-30 Winchester, introduced by Winchester with the Model 1894. Other common cartridges include: .22 calibre rimfire, .38 Special/.357 Magnum, .44 Special/.44 Magnum, .41 Magnum, .444 Marlin, .45-70 Government, .38-40 Winchester, .44-40 Winchester, .45 Colt, .25-35 Winchester, .32-40 Winchester, .35 Remington, .38-55 Winchester, .308 Marlin Express, and .300 Savage. There is some dispute about which of these cartridges can safely be used to hunt large game or large predators. Even in the largest calibers, the low velocities give these cartridges much lower energies than elephant gun cartridges with comparable calibers. However, even the smallest cartridges fit lightweight, handy rifles that can be excellent for hunting small herbivores, pest control, and personal defense.

Some stronger, larger pistols (usually revolvers) also accept some of these cartridges, permitting the use of the same ammunition in both a pistol and rifle. The rifle&#x27;s longer barrel and better accuracy permit higher velocities, longer ranges, and a wider selection of game. 

Some of these cartridges (e.g. the .50-70 Government (1866) and .45-70 Government (1873)) are developmental descendants of very early black powder metallic cartridges. When metallic cartridges and lever actions were first invented, very small, portable kits were developed for hand reloading and bullet molding (so-called &quot;cowboy reloading kits&quot;). These kits are still available for most low-pressure lever-action cartridges.

Stronger lever-actions, such as the action of the Marlin Model 1894, can utilize high-pressure cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary locking bolts (such as the Browning BLR with seven locking lugs) safely use very high-powered cartridges like the .300 Winchester Magnum, .300 WSM, and 7 mm Remington Magnum. Tilting block designs such as the Savage Model 99 are also strong enough to handle much higher chamber pressures.

Many lever actions have a tubular magazine under the barrel. It&#x27;s not uncommon to see extra ammunition stored in externally mounted &quot;shell holder&quot; racks (usually as &quot;sidesaddle&quot; on one side of the receiver, or on the buttstock) for quick on-field reloading. To operate safely, cartridges for these should have bullets with rounded tips, and some use rimfire primers rather than centerfire primers. The safety problem is that long-range aerodynamic supersonic bullets are pointed. In a tubular magazine, the points can accidentally fire centerfire cartridges. A related problem is that some pointed bullets have fragile tips, and can be damaged in a tubular magazine. Some lever actions such as the Savage Model 99 can be fed from either box or rotary magazines. The Winchester Model 1895 also uses a fixed box magazine, and was chambered for a variety of popular commercial and military rifle cartridges at the time. More recently, spitzer bullets with elastomeric tips have been developed.

Lever-action shotguns such as the Winchester Model 1887 are chambered in 10 or 12 gauge black powder shotgun shells, whereas the Model 1901 is chambered for 10-gauge smokeless shotshells. Modern reproductions are chambered for 12 gauge smokeless shells, while the Winchester Model 9410 shotgun is available in .410 bore.

== Comparison to bolt-action rifles ==

While lever-action rifles have always been popular with hunters and sporting shooters, they have not been widely accepted by the military. Several reasons for that have been proposed.

One significant reason for this is that it is harder to fire from the prone position with a lever-action rifle than it is with a bolt-action with either a straight pull or rotating bolt.

While lever-action rifles generally possess a greater rate of fire than bolt-action rifles, that was not always a feature, since, until about the turn of the 20th century, most militaries were wary of it being too high, afraid that excessive round consumption would put a strain on logistics of the military industry.

Tubular magazines, similar to the one used on the first bolt-action rifle and used on hunting lever-action rifles to this day, are sometimes described as a problem: while a tubular magazine is indeed incompatible with pointed centerfire &quot;spitzer&quot; bullets developed in the 1890s (discounting recently invented elastomer-tipped ones) due to the point of each cartridge&#x27;s projectile resting on the primer of the next cartridge in the magazine, lever-action rifles actually adapted for military use (such as the Winchester Model 1895, which saw service with the Russian Army in World War I) were fitted with a box magazine invented in the late 1870s.

Another explanation for the lack of widespread use of lever-action designs stems from the initial inability to fire high-pressure cartridges made possible by the invention of smokeless powder in the 1880s. Safe operation could only be carried out by using low-pressure cartridges in the toggle-lock lever-action rifles such as the Henry rifle and the following Winchester Model 1866, Winchester Model 1873, and Winchester Model 1876 (which was used by the mounted police of Canada). The newer lever-action rifle designs, notably the Winchester Model 1886, Winchester Model 1892, Winchester Model 1894, and the Winchester Model 1895, with a strong locking-block action designed by John Moses Browning, were capable of firing more powerful higher-pressure pistol and rifle cartridges.

In the end, the problem was economical. By the time these rifles became available in the late 19th century, militaries worldwide had put cheap bolt-action rifles into service and were unwilling to invest in producing more expensive lever-action rifles.

Due to the higher rate of fire and shorter overall length than most bolt-action rifles, lever-actions have remained popular to this day for sporting use, especially short- and medium-range hunting in forests, scrub, or bushland. Lever-action firearms have also been used in some quantity by prison guards in the United States, as well as by wildlife authorities in many parts of the world.
Many newer lever-action rifles are capable of shooting groups smaller than 1 minute of angle (MOA), making their accuracy equal to that of most modern bolt-action rifles.

Additionally, another advantage over typical bolt-action rifles is the lack of handedness: lever-action rifles, with similarities to pump-action shotguns, are frequently recommended as ambidextrous in sporting guidebooks.

<doc id="621321" wikidata="Q1068543" url="?curid=621321" title="Chamber (firearms)">
<text>The chamber of a firearm is the cavity at the back end of a breechloading weapon&#x27;s barrel or cylinder, where the ammunition is inserted before being fired. The rear opening of the chamber is the breech, and is sealed by the breechblock or the bolt.

==Function==
The act of &quot;chambering&quot; a cartridge means the insertion of a round into the chamber, either manually or through the action of the weapon, e.g., pump-action, lever-action, bolt action, or autoloading operation generally in anticipation of firing the weapon, without need to &quot;load&quot; the weapon upon decision to use it (reducing the number of &quot;actions&quot; needed to discharge).

Automatic and single-shot pistols (such as Derringers), rifles, and shotguns generally have a single chamber integral to their barrels, but revolvers have multiple chambers in their cylinder, and no chamber in their barrel. Thus, pistols, rifles, and shotguns can usually still be fired with the magazine removed as long as a cartridge is inserted into the chamber, while a revolver cannot be fired at all with its cylinder swung out or broken open.

In firearms design or modification, &quot;chambering&quot; is fitting a weapon&#x27;s chamber for a particular caliber or round, so a Colt Model 1911 is &quot;chambered&quot; for .45 ACP or .38 Super, or &quot;re-chambered&quot; for .38/.45 Clerke. While the majority of firearms are chambered for one caliber, some are chambered for multiple calibers; however firing an oversized or undersized cartridge can be hazardous.

==Fluted chamber==

In the barrel chamber, fluting refers to gas relief flutes/grooves used to ease the extraction of cartridges. They may also come in annular and helical forms. Notable firearms using fluted chambers are the roller-delayed blowback Heckler &amp; Koch G3 and lever-delayed blowback FAMAS and AA-52.

Roller or lever-delayed blowback arms require that the bolt starts moving while the bullet is still in the barrel and the spent case is fully pressurized. Fluting the end of the chamber allows combustion gasses to float the neck and front of the cartridge case providing pressure equalization between the front outer surface of the cartridge case and its interior. The roller-delayed blowback StG 45(M) assault rifle prototypes proved pressure equalization fluting is desirable, since the breech of roller or lever-delayed blowback arms is opened whilst under very high internal cartridge case pressure that presses a spent (bloated) cartridge casing against the chamber walls which can cause significant problems during the cartridge extraction phase. Using traditionally cut (non-fluted) chambers in the StG 45(M) resulted in separated cartridge case heads during testing.

==Ported chamber==
A barrel chamber with pressure relief ports that allows gas to leak around the cartridge during extraction. Basically, the opposite of a fluted chamber, as it is intended for the cartridge to stick to the chamber wall making a slight delay of extraction. This requires a welded-on sleeve with an annular groove to contain the pressure.

==Multi chamber==
Mostly used on artillery guns. Multi chambered is where the barrel has a series of chambers to propel the round down the barrel to increase speed and range. The Lymann-Haskell multi chamber gun is an example.

==Forensics==
The chamber is a key component to the practice of forensic firearm examination. The chamber is known to imprint its surface striations irregularities on the cartridge case, in what are called chamber marks, due to the pressure produced when shooting. Such imperfections in chamber may be produced in the manufacturing process or through extensive use. Such chamber marks are more pronounced on substandard firearms or when firing from an undersized chamber. 

In recent years there has been a push to automate this process via the use of automated firearms databases. Ballistics identification has also seen the development of microstamping technology which purposefully creates chamber marks through engravings on the firing pin and breech face.

<doc id="621328" wikidata="Q739761" url="?curid=621328" title="Schneider CA1">
<text>The Schneider CA 1 (originally named the Schneider CA) was the first French tank, developed during the First World War.

The Schneider was inspired by the need to overcome the stalemate of trench warfare which on the Western Front prevailed during most of the Great War. It was designed specifically to open passages for the infantry through barbed wire and then to suppress German machine gun nests. After a first concept by Jacques Quellennec devised in November 1914, the type was developed from May 1915 onwards by engineer Eugène Brillié, paralleling British development of tanks the same year. Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne in December 1915 began to urge for the formation of French armoured units, leading to an order in February 1916 for four hundred Schneider CA tanks, which were manufactured by SOMUA, a subsidiary of Schneider located in a suburb of Paris, between September 1916 and August 1918.

Like most early tanks, the Schneider was built like a simple armoured box, without compartmentalisation of the inner space. It lacked a turret, with the main armament, a short 75 mm cannon, in a sponson on the right side. By later standards it would therefore have been an assault gun instead of a tank. The vehicle was considered a very imperfect design, because of a poor layout, insufficient fire-power, a cramped interior and inferior mobility due to an overhanging nose section, which had been designed to crush through the belts of barbed wire but in practice caused the tank to get stuck. Improved designs were almost immediately initiated but the production of these, the Schneider CA 2, CA 3 and CA 4, was eventually cancelled.

The Schneider CA 1 tanks were widely used in combat during the last war years. Their first action on 16 April 1917 was largely a failure, the tank units suffering heavy losses, but later engagements were more successful. In 1918 the Schneider tanks played an important role in halting the German spring offensive and breaking the German front in the French summer offensives. They were active until the end of September 1918, less than two months before the Armistice of 11 November 1918, their numbers having dropped considerably due to attrition. After the war the surviving tanks were mostly rebuilt as utility vehicles but six Schneider tanks were deployed by Spain in the Rif War in Morocco and the type saw its last action in the beginning of the Spanish Civil War.

==Development==

===Armoured caterpillar tractor development===
Before the First World War, mechanic Charles Marius Fouché cooperated with engineer Édouard Quellennec and the latter&#x27;s son Jacques Quellennec to adapt existing caterpillar tractors to the conditions of Egyptian and French farming, among them the Holt Model 75. In this context in 1914 contacts were made with engineer Eugène Brillié of Schneider &amp; Co. to adapt the Castéran Flexible Track Tractor. When that year war broke out, Jacques Quellennec was drafted as an infantry sergeant, witnessed most men of his unit being slaughtered during the First Battle of the Marne and was then severely wounded at the end of October. While recovering, he devised plans for an armoured tractor armed with a machine-gun and capable of destroying German machine-gun nests. Many in this period had comparable ideas but contrary to most, Quellennec had excellent contacts. Fouché had become a second lieutenant with the &quot;Grand Parc Automobile de Réserve&quot; of the &quot;Service Automobile&quot;, the Army branch responsible for motorisation, and Brillié was chief designer with one of France&#x27;s main arms manufacturers. Early December, Quellennec met Fouché in Paris and both then went to Brillié to present drawings of a tracked armoured fighting vehicle. During a second visit Quellennec urged Brillié to bring over two Holt Model 75 tractors, at that time present in Tunisia, to France in order to perform the first trials. Brillié showed himself less than enthusiastic about the idea, objecting there would be not enough room on a tractor for both crew and armament. In February 1915, Quellennec was sent to an air force training base and tasked Fouché with trying to convince Brillié, without much apparent success.

Meanwhile, the Schneider company had been given the order to develop heavy artillery tractors in January 1915. On 30 January it sent out its chief designer, Brillié, to investigate tracked tractors from the American Holt Company, at that time participating in a test programme at Aldershot in England. On his return, Brillié, who had earlier been involved in designing armoured cars for Spain, apparently without mentioning being influenced in this by Quellennec, convinced the company management to initiate studies on the development of an armoured fighting vehicle, based on the &quot;Baby Holt&quot; chassis, two of which were ordered. The type was intended to be sold to the French Cavalry.

Experiments on the Holt caterpillar tracks started in May 1915 at the Schneider plant with a 75 hp wheel-directed model and the 45 hp integral caterpillar Baby Holt, showing the superiority of the latter. The Castéran and the Killen-Strait Tractor were also tested but rejected. Work was now begun on an &quot;auto-mitrailleuse blindée à chenilles&quot; (&quot;tracked armoured self-propelled machine gun&quot;). On 16 June, new experiments followed in front of the President of the Republic Raymond Poincaré, leading to the order of six, later expanded to ten, armoured tracked vehicles for further testing. The type was since July called a &quot;machine offensive à chenilles&quot; (&quot;tracked offensive machine&quot;) and was based on the &quot;Baby Holt&quot; with a suspension that was to be thirty centimetres lengthened. In August drawings were made of what was now designated the &quot;tracteur blindé et armé&quot; (&quot;armoured and armed tractor&quot;). In September 1915 the Schneider programme was combined with an official one for the development of an armoured barbed wire cutter by engineer and Member of Parliament Jules-Louis Breton, the Breton-Prétot machine. Ten of the fifteen available &quot;Baby Holt&quot; vehicles were to be armoured and fitted with the wire cutter of which ten systems had been ordered on 7 August. This involved the &quot;Service Automobile&quot; in the project. On 10 September, new experiments were made for &quot;Commandant&quot; L. Ferrus, an officer who had been involved in the study (and ultimate rejection) of the Levavasseur tank project in 1908.

===The Souain experiment===
On 9 December 1915 in the Souain experiment, a Schneider prototype armoured tank, a Baby Holt chassis with boiler-plate armour, was demonstrated to the French Army. Among the onlookers were General Philippe Pétain, and Colonel Jean Baptiste Eugène Estienne — an artillery man and engineer held in very high regard throughout the army for his unmatched technological and tactical expertise. The results of the prototype tank were, at least according to Estienne, excellent, displaying remarkable mobility in the difficult terrain of the former battlefield of Souain. The length of the Baby Holt however appeared to be too short to bridge German trenches, justifying the development of longer caterpillar tracks for the French tank project. For Estienne the vehicle shown embodied concepts about armoured fighting vehicles which he had been advocating since August 1914. Already on 1 December Estienne had proposed to the French GHQ the use of tracked armoured tractors to move infantry, equipment and cannon over the battlefield, having performed some trials with British caterpillar tractors. On 11 December Estienne let a certain lieutenant Thibier draw a sketch of two conceptions: the one of a Baby Holt chassis fitted at the front and the back with auxiliary rollers, to improve the trench-crossing capacity; the other of an elongated suspension protected by side armour.

===Estienne&#x27;s proposal===

On 12 December Estienne presented to the High Command, represented by General Maurice Janin, a plan to form an armoured force equipped with tracked vehicles. In it he formulated some specifications. The machines should be twelve tonnes in weight, protected by fifteen to twenty millimetres of armour. The dimensions of the vehicles were indicated as four metres long, 2.6 metres wide and 1.6 metres high. An engine of eighty horsepower should allow for a maximum speed of nine kilometres per hour and a low speed of three. The vehicle should be able to cross a two metres wide trench and tow a seven tonne armoured sled holding twenty men with arms and equipment. Its armament should consist of two machine guns and a 37 mm gun, able to pierce the armour shields of enemy machine guns. The crew would total four men.

On 20 December Estienne, on leave in Paris, together with Ferrus visited Louis Renault in Boulogne-Billancourt, in vain trying to convince the car producer to get involved in the production of the new weapon system. Later the same day they received Brillié who disclosed the amount of work already done by Schneider on its project. The August order of ten vehicles had been confirmed on 7 December; on the 15th the official contract was signed. On 22 December, the Schneider company began to prepare for armoured vehicle production. It indicated it had the capacity to manufacture in total three hundred to four hundred units in 1916. At this point the Schneider project envisioned a ten tonne vehicle, armed by a 75 mm gun, protected by 10 mm chrome steel and powered by a specially developed 50 HP engine allowing for a top speed of 7 km/h. On the 27th, the paper design was adapted to incorporate some of Estienne&#x27;s ideas; because the original drawings have not been rediscovered, it is impossible to determine to what extent this was done. The same day new tests were held with the Baby Holt tractor at Vincennes; the next day Estienne further elaborated his proposal at the GHQ. The prototype was fitted with extensions at the front and rear end to improve its trench-crossing capacity and successfully tested on 5 January 1916. 

Estienne&#x27;s plan met with approbation from Commander-in-chief Joffre, who on 7 January 1916 proposed the production of an &quot;offensive engine&quot; to Minister of Armaments Albert Thomas. On the 18th Estienne was received by Joffre personally to clarify his ideas. In a letter to the ministry dated 31 January 1916 Joffre desired the production of four hundred tanks of the type suggested by Estienne. Although there had been a long prior development phase with the Schneider company, Estienne&#x27;s decisive role in getting the Schneider vehicle produced in mass has earned him a traditional position in history as the creator of the first French tank. This is put into perspective by his limited involvement in its technical design; as early as January 1916 the actual completion was entrusted to a ministerial bureau headed by General Léon Augustin Jean Marie Mourret, director of the Army automobile service. Mourret did not closely cooperate with Estienne, who was essentially excluded from decisions of a technical nature.

In January it was decided to manufacture a longer suspension. Schneider had, already before 9 December 1915, devised a system thirty centimetres longer with seven road wheels instead of five. Mourret ordered to build an alternative system. Two &quot;Baby Holt&quot; tractors, part of the order of fifteen by Schneider on 21 September 1915, and property of the French State, were during two weeks from 2 February onwards in an army workshop combined into a single elongated vehicle, a &quot;caterpillar offensif allongé&quot;, by Lieutenant Charles Fouché, assisted by a small team of mechanics. The workshop was in the Farman factory at Billancourt appropriated from the &quot;l&#x27;Automobilette&quot; company. It was again about a foot longer than the Schneider type, and featured three bogies with a total of eight road wheels. The new suspension system was not based on exact blueprints but improvised by private Pierre Lescudé. On 17 February the eight-wheeled system, which prototype was later designated &quot;L&#x27;appareil n° 1 Type A&quot; (&quot;Device Number 1 Type A&quot;) was tested at Vincennes, easily crossing trenches up to 1.75 metres wide and overcoming barbed wire obstacles. On 21 February successful tests were held at Vincennes, the Schneider company providing a non-elongated Baby Holt chassis for comparison. From this it was concluded that the tank was sufficiently developed to justify a production order. On 25 February 1916 the War Ministry secretly ordered the production of four hundred &quot;tracteurs-chenilles type Schneider &amp; Cie blindés&quot; (&quot;tracked and armoured tractors of the Schneider type&quot;), at a price of 56,000 French francs per vehicle. For security reasons it was pretended these were simple towing vehicles, &quot;tracteurs Estienne&quot;. The earlier order of 15 December for ten vehicles was hereby replaced. Fouché was ordered to improve the prototype, which resulted in a slightly changed &quot;L&#x27;appareil n° 1 Type B&quot;, tested on 2 March. Further changes, now including improvised side armour extending to the front in a bow, created the &quot;L&#x27;appareil n° 1 Type C&quot; or &quot;Machine Profilée&quot; which was tested on 17 March. On 27 February, Schneider had been asked to provide a first armoured superstructure made of boiler steel, which was late March placed on the eight-wheeled chassis. Pictures of this vehicle have often been presented in books as showing the &quot;first Schneider CA prototype&quot;. However, this entire development line, even though its official order had been based on it, would not be ancestral to the Schneider tank. In the Spring of 1916, for reasons that are not entirely clear, there was a fundamental falling-out between the French Army and Schneider Cie. The latter company would develop and produce its Schneider tank on the basis of its seven-wheeled chassis, which had been patented on 17 January; the Army would develop the eight-wheeled system into the Saint-Chamond heavy tank.

==Designation==
Whereas the first order spoke of &quot;tracteurs Estienne&quot;, the factory designation of the tank was &quot;Schneider CA&quot;. The meaning of &quot;CA&quot; is uncertain. Later it was usually understood to mean &quot;Char d&#x27;Assaut&quot;, literally &quot;chariot&quot; and today the full French word for &quot;tank&quot;. However, the &quot;CA&quot; part first surfaces in a &quot;Tracteur CA&quot;, as a next development step in 1916 after the &quot;Tracteur A&quot; (the lengthened Army prototype or &quot;L&#x27;appareil n° 1 Type A&quot;), &quot;Tracteur B&quot; and &quot;Tracteur C&quot;. The term &quot;char d&#x27;assaut&quot; in the meaning of &quot;tank&quot; was first applied by Estienne in October 1916. Sometimes a reversed order was used: Schneider AC. The combination with &quot;char&quot; was typically in the form of &quot;Char Schneider&quot;. A gun-towing tractor (&quot;remorqueur&quot;), based on the CA chassis and produced in 1918, was designated Schneider CD, and a prototype &quot;porteur&quot; variant of it, intended to carry a heavy artillery piece, the CD3. This would seem to indicate that the CA suffix was merely a Schneider product code similar to those used by Renault.

At the end of 1916, the type was called &quot;Schneider CA 1&quot; to make a distinction with a derived tank project, the &quot;Schneider CA 2&quot;. In 1917 the Schneider CA 1 is also called the &quot;Schneider 1916&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;Schneider 1917&quot;, another name for the next tank project, the &quot;Schneider CA 3&quot;. This had its origin in a demand by Estienne on 30 January 1917 to agree on a standardised terminology. General Mourret then proposed to use the official designations &quot;Schneider Modèle 1916&quot; and &quot;Saint-Chamond Modèle 1916&quot;.

==Description==
The Schneider is effectively an armoured steel box on top of a caterpillar tractor. It has no turret; the main armament is a 75 mm &quot;Blockhaus Schneider&quot; &quot;fortification gun&quot; in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand to the left of the barrel to operate the gun. The cannon type was developed from a 75 mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed . This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75 mm shell but with a reduced propelling charge, shortening the overall length of the round from to , allowing for a muzzle velocity of only . The maximum range of the gun was metres, the practical range was and the tank needed to close within of a target for precision shooting. In its mounting the gun had a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. The tank carried ninety rounds for the gun stowed vertically in bins to the right of the cannon (20), extreme right rear corner (14), left of the engine (32) and left rear corner (24). 

Secondary armement was two 8 mm Hotchkiss M1914 machine guns in the sides of the tank in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on pintles. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. A bin, in the extreme left corner, was for four thousand rounds of 8 mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts, each of ninety-six rounds, were carried for a total of 4,800 rounds.

Another unusual feature is the slanted overhang of the frontal part of the chassis which has the form of a pointed nose, ending in a high obliquely protruding steel spur. It had been designed for cutting through and crushing down German barbed wire, thus opening passages for following French infantry, originally seen as the primary function of the system. This long overhang could cause the tank to ditch itself readily. The tank is long by wide and high. There was no separation of the crew from the engine and transmission. The room available to the crew, illuminated by three small electric lights, is entered through a double door in the back of the tank and is extremely cramped. The crew consisted of a commanding officer who was also the driver; an NCO who was the gunner, two machine gunners, a loader who assisted both the cannon and the machine guns and a mechanic who doubled as a machine gun loader. Four of these six men had, at their assigned position, to crouch inside a high space between the roof and the tank&#x27;s floor. They then had to stand within two narrow troughs, one, behind the driver&#x27;s seat, used by the gunner and a second square one more to the back, between the suspension elements, used by the cannon loader and the two machine gunners. Most of the space however, had a height of just three feet between the roof and the covering of transmission and suspension: to load the right machine gun, the mechanic had to lie on his belly. Each Schneider tank team included three riflemen who in battle accompanied the tank. All-around protection was thick steel plate, later improved by a spaced armour of 5.4/5.5 mm, raising the weight from 12.5 to 13.5 tonnes. The roof was armour. The plates are partly riveted; the superstructure is largely bolted.

The 60 hp Schneider gasoline engine and its radiator are located in the front part of the tank, to the immediate left of the driver. The four cylinder, 135×170 9,753 cc, engine was specially built for the Schneider CA. It delivered a maximum output of at 1,000 rpm. The three forward speed gearbox, as well as the differentials, which can be engaged by brakes on the half shafts to steer the tank, are all located on the rear axle. They are linked to the engine in the front by a driveshaft and a primary clutch. A secondary clutch is coupled to each sprocket and can be decoupled for a tight turn. The main clutch and the main brakes can be engaged by pedals, the throttle by a handle. By means of a reverse device the three gears can also be applied to drive backwards. Steering was generally very tiring and there was a tendency to jump out of gear when the clutch was engaged too forcefully. 

The tank&#x27;s official top speed is only ; practical speed was . At 1,000 engine rpm, the first gear equalled a speed of 2 km/h, the second 3.95 km/h, the third 6.75 km/h. At the Schneider could climb a slope of 55%. The capacity to overcome obstacles, limited to a parapet of about eighty centimetres, is improved by two short climbing tails, fitted to the left and right of the lower hull rear. The lower profile of the tails is curved, allowing the vehicle to gradually raise itself above a trench floor, until its centre of gravity shifts over the edge causing its hull to suddenly tumble forward. The trench-crossing capacity is about 175 centimetres. The wading capacity is eighty centimetres. Two fuel gravity-feed reservoirs placed above the engine below the right front roof and nose plate, have a total capacity of 145 litres, and allow for a practical range of about fifty kilometres, though the official range is eighty kilometres. The suspension consists of seven double road wheels attached to two bogies, the one in front carrying three, the other four. The rear bogie is sprung by two vertical coil springs, the front one larger than the rear one. The front bogies of the left and the right, each sprung by a vertical coil of narrow diameter, are connected to each other by means of a yoke-like transverse beam, itself attached to the hull bottom by two wide vertical coils springs, diminishing rolling and tilt when crossing rough terrain. Ground clearance is forty-one centimetres. There are five small return rollers. The six-spoked idler is attached to the front bogie and can thus move vertically to some degree. The sprocket, having twenty teeth, is however fixed in relation to the hull. It has a somewhat larger diameter than the idler, causing the upper track profile to slope slightly downwards to the front. The track consists of thirty-three flat links with a width of thirty-six centimetres. The ground pressure is about 0.75 kg/cm2.
As the traverse of the main gun was limited, it had first to be pointed in the general direction of the target by the driver-commander swivelling the entire vehicle. To facilitate this, a small rectangular frame is fitted on the right side of the nose of the tank. Looking through it, the driver had a sightline parallel to that of the cannon in a neutral position. In practice, the commander had too limited view of his surroundings through the small hatches to his left, front and right and had to put his head out of his rectangular top hatch to observe the enemy. Small rectangular hatches, fitted with a vision slit, are further present to the front of each machine-gun. The main ventilation is provided by a large skylight slit running along the midline of the hull. It is doubly roofed with the lower roof having a second slit in its top, while the higher roof has open lower sides, creating oblique oblong ventilation channels through which fresh air can be sucked in from the outside. The top roof is the highest element of the vehicle. With later production vehicles, polluted air is removed through a broad ventilation grid in the nose, having a recessed armour plate below it. To the left and the right of the skylight roof rectangular escape hatches are present in the hull top.

The vehicles were delivered by the factory painted in the standard grey colour used by the Artillery Arm and other branches of the army often called &quot;artillery grey&quot;. It was a rather light pearl grey shade. At first, by the &quot;Section Camouflage&quot; in the field a specially designed complex striped flame pattern was added consisting of narrow vertical red brown, dark green and yellow ochre patches, delineated in black. This was intended to break the contours of the vehicles. To some observers, it made them seem strikingly colourful. The original grey paint was perhaps only partly covered, including it in the ensemble; an alternative interpretation of the lightest patches seen in black-and-white photographs is that it represents a light green hue. Later, when the appliqué armour was added a much simpler scheme was used where the same hues were shown in large irregular areas, again demarcated in black. In the first combat actions, it became clear that German machine gunners concentrated their fire on the vision slits. To confuse them, in the summer of 1917 a cross-hatched scheme of narrow vertical and horizontal dark grey stripes was applied on top of the original patches. The stripes continued over the side machine gun ball mounts but a round area remained untouched to suggest a false position. The individual Schneider CA tanks had serial numbers ranging from 61001 to 61399. The first tactical markings consisted of simple numbers, to distinguish the individual tanks within a training unit. Early 1917 the combat units used small inconspicuous playing-card symbols, each symbol indicating one of four batteries within a &quot;groupe&quot;. These were sprayed in white on the tank side, often combined with an individual tank number, depending on the style each &quot;groupe&quot; preferred. The tank number could also be indicated on the tank spur, by horizontal stripes.

==Production==
In the original contract of 25 February 1916 it had been stipulated that all four hundred units would be delivered that same year: the first hundred by 25 August and the last by 25 November, completing the full order in nine months. Because Schneider had no experience in tracked armoured fighting vehicle production and a true pilot model was lacking, this was highly optimistic. Schneider company had expected to be able to employ the other major French arms producer, the &quot;Forges et Aciéries de la Marine et d&#x27;Homécourt&quot;, as a subcontractor but they had developed a heavier tank design, the Saint-Chamond tank. As a result, the first prototype could only be presented to the Ministry of Armament on 4 August. The Schneider subsidiary &quot;Société d&#x27;outillage mécanique et d&#x27;usinage d&#x27;artillerie&quot; (SOMUA) at Saint Ouen near Paris was only able to finish the first vehicle chassis on 5 September, which was delivered at the training centre at Marly on 8 September with the first Army tests carried out on 12 September. By the original deadline of 25 November just eight vehicles had been delivered; on 4 January 1917 thirty-two were present. To aggravate matters, these were training vehicles, not fitted with hardened armour but ordinary boiler plate.

Late January production picked up, reaching three or four units per day. However, it soon slowed down again because the new Commander-in-Chief, Robert Nivelle, ordered that priority should be given to the manufacture of the Schneider CD towing tractor. As a result, production fell from seventy tanks between 28 January and 27 February to sixty between the latter date and 28 March and only twenty additional vehicles were manufactured up to 12 April. By 15 March the Army had accepted 150 tanks; by 1 April 208, by 1 June 322. Then production almost came to a halt, both because of a loss of interest in the type and to maintain a sufficient supply of spare parts. The total reached 340 on 30 September, 370 on 1 December and 372 on 19 December. The full order would not be completed until August 1918. The ultimate costs of the project were about fifty million French francs. Official factory deliveries were fifty in 1916, 326 in 1917 and twenty-four in 1918. Of these 397 were transferred to the French Army.

Early in 1917 one vehicle was delivered to Italy. It had been ordered by the Italians after Captain Alfredo Bennicelli had observed the first French Army testing in September 1916; the single vehicle was tested in 1917 and deployed on the Kras front. It made a favourable impression and in the Autumn of 1917 the Italian High Command desired either the purchase of twenty Schneiders or the tooling capable of producing them. This plan was abandoned after the heavy defeat of the Italian Army at the Battle of Caporetto. Its High Command now envisaged a far larger number of tanks, demanding the import or manufacture of about 1,500 Schneiders. After it had become clear that the French industry did not have the spare capacity to meet those demands and that they far out-reached the possibilities of domestic production, it was decided to produce the smaller, cheaper and more modern FIAT 3000 (a copy of the Renault FT) instead, three of which had been received in May 1918.

==Improvements==

During production, the type was gradually improved, which caused further delays. From the 245th vehicle onwards an automatic starter was installed, engaged by a handle, as the original manual system did not allow for a sufficiently quick response to a changing battlefield situation. Also it was decided the design was too poorly protected. In response to the first use of British Mark I tanks on 15 September 1916, the Germans had begun to introduce anti-tank weapons and tactics. One of the measures taken by them was the issuing of the &quot;Kerngeschoss&quot; or &quot;K-bullet&quot;, a hardened steel core round capable of piercing the thin armour of tanks. To defeat it, from the 210th vehicle onwards the Schneider tank was fitted with extra 5.4 mm thick armour plates on the sides and front with a space of four centimetres between the main armour and these appliqué plates. Even without the spaced armour, the front plates would have been immune against K-bullet fire from a distance of two hundred metres, because they were angled at 60°, providing an effective line-of-sight thickness of . During the spring of 1917 existing vehicles were uparmoured (creating a &quot;surblindé&quot; version) by the army workshop at Champlieu. Some of these, such as a vehicle with series number 61213, were fitted with additional armour plates on the vertical front surfaces, including an extra rectangular shield around the gun barrel. On 1 April 1917 of the 208 tanks available only about a hundred had been retrofitted. None of the older tanks had at this point yet received the new starter engine, this part of the improvement process would take until the end of the summer.

The first combat actions showed that the fuel reservoirs were prone to explode when the vehicle was hit by an artillery round. To remedy this the reservoirs were replaced by fuel tanks with a double wall, using a felt filler layer to absorb gasoline leakages. Furthermore, these fuel tanks, each containing , were moved to a safer position under armour though still outside the hull, in vertical rectangular steel boxes to the left and right of the rear door. This necessitated the construction of an additional safer exit, at the left side of the vehicle. On 8 September 1917 only twelve tanks had been changed to this new configuration. As of 21 March 1918 about 245 vehicles featured all three of these major improvements.

Numerous smaller modifications were introduced during the testing phase and the production run. The first included an improved cooling system and better ventilation to prevent and remove carbon monoxide fumes which otherwise threatened to asphyxiate the crew within an hour. To prevent dirt entering the chassis near the crank, at the bottom of the vehicle an armour plate was added. Later additions were a periscope sight, an exhaust pipe, and speaking tubes for internal communications. In 1917, to provide some modicum of communication with higher command levels and accompanying tanks or infantry, a hinged metal shield was attached to the rear of the hull skylight roof. Its back was painted in a conspicuous horizontal tricolour red-white-red scheme. When lifted by means of a steel cable operable from the inside via a grooved small vertical plate located on the front of the skylight roof, it indicated the position of the tank to friendly observers from behind. Several versions of this system existed, differing in the precise location of the shield and its shape. It was especially intended to signal to the infantry that it was safe to advance after the tank had neutralised all enemy machine-gun positions.

Some improvements were studied but not applied. Simple ones included the introduction of track shoes with a chevron profile to improve grip. Also it was originally considered to use blocks of sodium peroxide (&quot;oxylithe&quot;) to remove the carbon monoxide, but this was rejected in view of the fire hazard. The first testing to equip a French tank with a radio set was carried out in the summer of 1917 with a Schneider CA, using a twelve-metre wire antenna with a range of . A second test with a fourteen-metre antenna on 18 August 1917 established that contact could be made with an aircraft within a distance of two kilometres provided that the tank was not moving, and it was decided to equip the command tanks of two units, AS 11 and AS 12, with an &quot;Émitteur 10&quot;ter radio set.

Much more far-reaching were early proposals to fundamentally change the design, to be implemented during the production run. These were inspired by the awkward layout; in order to limit the width of the tank, the main armament had been placed in an inconvenient position. On 1 December 1916 a certain Lieutenant Saar submitted drawings showing a vehicle on which the 75 mm cannon had been replaced by a 47 mm gun turret, the number of machine guns was raised to six, the number of vision slits to eleven and the engine was located in the middle of the hull. On 28 and 29 December 1916 the Schneider company considered moving the 75 mm gun to the nose of the vehicle and give it a 120° traverse.

==Operational history==

===Training===
To deploy tanks, it was first needed to train crews and create tank units. On 14 July 1916 Estienne started to set up a training base at the &quot;Fort du Trou-d&#x27;Enfer&quot;, a fortress at Marly-le-Roi, west of Paris. For reasons of secrecy this location was officially attached to the 81st Heavy Artillery Regiment, a depot unit. On 15 August the camp was formally established and quickly filled with recruits, most of them young volunteers from various French armies. At Marly the crews received their first instruction consisting of the basics of maintenance and a lot of driver training with an emphasis on crossing trenches, avoiding shell craters and running down trees and walls. Because no actual Schneider vehicles were available at first, Holt tractors were used instead; later boiler plate training chassis were employed with the superstructure removed and replaced by a protective wooden frame. From the spring of 1917 onwards about seven vehicles were used for this goal. For unit training and live fire exercises, which required much larger manoeuvre grounds, on 30 August 1916 a camp was established at Cercottes. It received its first training vehicles on 17 November 1916. To get better acquainted with the mechanical side of the tanks, most crew members left Cercottes for a month to work as a trainee at the SOMUA factory. New vehicles would normally be first delivered at Cercottes. In 1917 the Cercottes base grew to a strength of about five thousand men, many of them sent there from units trying to get rid of undesirable elements, forcing the base command to reduce manpower by again removing them. On 28 September 1916 a large instruction centre was established at Champlieu, south of Compiègne. This location, close to the frontline and officially part of the warzone, could serve for final training and sending out battle-ready units to those armies needing them. The tank workshops were also located there, repairing and updating existing vehicles. The bases at Cercottes and Champlieu used about sixty-four tanks purely for training purposes, to limit the wear on the combat vehicles.

===Unit formation===
The French Army did not intend to create an independent tank force; the tank units would be part of the Artillery Arm, which was reflected in the organisational terminology. The basic units were officially called &quot;Groupes&quot;, but had the designation &quot;AS&quot;, for &quot;Artillerie Spéciale&quot;. Each group consisted of four batteries, each battery again of four tanks. This would have resulted in a total of sixteen tanks and indeed this was the official organic strength of an AS, but the fourth battery was normally a depot unit, intended to provide replacement vehicles and crews for the other three batteries. It had an official allotment of three tanks and the total matériel strength of an AS was thus fifteen. Actual operational strength varied wildly, due to frequent breakdowns. The personnel strength consisted of twelve officers — each commanding a tank of the three regular batteries — sixteen NCOs and 110 men of lower rank. In practice often four batteries of three tanks were fielded, to allow for a greater tactical flexibility. The first Schneider CA units were formed from 17 November 1916 onwards. Six AS were raised until the end of January 1917, three more in February and March each and again two in April and May each for a total of seventeen operational &quot;Groupes&quot;, numbered AS 1–17. Three more had been created by 2 June 1917, AS 18, 19 and 20, but were almost immediately dissolved, their personnel retrained to form Saint Chamond units. Between 1 March and 1 May 1917 the AS were combined into five larger units, called &quot;Groupements&quot;, with a variable strength. In May 1918, three of the surviving four &quot;Groupements&quot;, I, II and IV, were each attached to three light tank Renault FT battalions to form larger &quot;Régiments de Artillerie Spéciale&quot;, the &quot;501e, 502e&quot; and &quot;504e RAS&quot; respectively.

===Actions===

====Berry-au-Bac====

Estienne had hoped to create a powerful and large striking force before committing his tanks to battle. He had strongly disapproved of the, in his eyes premature, British use of tanks in September 1916, just two months after first deliveries of the Mark I. However, political circumstances would compel him to deploy the &quot;Artillerie Spéciale&quot; before it was at full strength or adequately trained. In December 1916 Robert Nivelle had been appointed supreme French commander on the promise that his tactical innovation of the &quot;rolling barrage&quot; would ensure a quick collapse of the German front. Not favourably inclined towards the independent mass deployment of armour, Nivelle hoped that the tanks produced could be made of some use by letting them assist his planned offensive. Ultimately, the Germans learned of the French intentions so that strategic surprise was lost, allowing them to reinforce the threatened front sectors; nor was there a tactical surprise, as it had become known that French tanks existed and were about to be introduced. Three AS first assembled at the frontline near Beuvraignes in late March 1917, hoping to exploit a possible success in an offensive by the Third Army, that however had to be cancelled because of the strategic German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. Eventually, the tank units were to support the attack by the Fifth Army at the Aisne and were concentrated in a nine kilometres wide sector south of Juvincourt-et-Damary, chosen for its firm ground. The Germans had created a strong defensive belt in this area, held by four divisions of the Bavarian Army, with a depth of nine kilometres and divided into four main trench systems. The plan was for the French infantry to take the first and second trench within about four hours, advancing behind the &quot;creeping barrage&quot;, after which the tanks would immediately exploit this success and maintain the momentum of the offensive by quickly progressing towards the third trench, directly followed by the infantry; together they would conquer the third and fourth trenches. The &quot;strategic rupture&quot; resulting from this and many adjoining attacks was to be exploited through deep penetrations by large reserve infantry armies, outflanking the Hindenburg Line from the south. 

Three &quot;Groupements&quot; were committed to the offensive. Two of these, named after their commanders Louis Bossut and Louis Léonard Chaubès, were attached to the 32nd and 5th Army Corps respectively and would engage on the first day. &quot;Groupement Bossut&quot; consisted of five &quot;groupes&quot;: AS 2, 4, 5, 6 and 9, thus fielding eighty tanks, as the AS in this phase of the war operated at full strength with four batteries of four tanks. &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot;, created on 8 March, included AS 3, 7 and 8, with about forty-eight tanks. Each &quot;Groupement&quot; was reinforced by a supply and recovery unit or &quot;Section de Réparations et de Ravitaillement&quot; which besides two unarmed Saint-Chamonds and some Baby Holt tractors was equipped with two unarmed Schneider CA tanks, towing &quot;Troy&quot; trailers with fuel, bringing the total at 132 Schneider vehicles, at that date the largest tank force ever deployed. On 13 April the tank units concentrated behind the frontline. There they were joined by supporting infantry companies: five from the &quot;154e R.I.&quot; of the &quot;165e D.I.&quot; for &quot;Groupement Bossut&quot; and three of the &quot;76e R.I.&quot; of the &quot;125e D.I.&quot; for &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot;. 

During the early morning of 16 April 1917 the Nivelle Offensive was launched. In the sector where the tanks operated the initial waves of French infantry succeeded in taking the first and second German trenches as planned, but with very heavy losses. The French artillery was insufficient in number to simultaneously sustain the creeping barrage and suppress the numerous German artillery batteries. This was aggravated by the German air superiority which allowed artillery observation planes to precisely direct German interdiction fire on the advancing French columns. &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot; suffered many losses before it was even able to leave the French lines. When arriving at the frontline in the early afternoon, it had to assist the infantry in clearing the second trench of the last German remnants. These did not panic at the sight of the French tanks but had been trained to hide from them, leaving their cover to engage the French infantry when the armoured vehicles had moved on. At the end of the day, the French infantry proved unable to continue the offensive and the last surviving French tanks had to be withdrawn. More to the east, north of Berry-au-Bac after which village later the entire tank action would be named, &quot;Groupement Bossut&quot; proved more successful. It managed to cross the various trench lines losing only a few vehicles and in the late morning concentrated to carry on the offensive. However, around 11:00 the tank of Bossut, &quot;Trompe-la-Mort&quot; (&quot;Dare-devil&quot;) leading the advance, carrying a tricolour fanion blessed in the Sacré-Cœur at Montmartre, received a direct heavy artillery hit, incinerating most of the crew and blowing Bossut himself from the rear entrance from which he had been directing the battle, killed by a shell splinter through the heart. Nevertheless, the Schneiders continued their progress, advancing several miles in a narrow penetration through a shallow valley towards the third German trench. The weakened infantry though, was unable to follow, forcing the tanks to wait for the arrival of reserve units. For several hours the tanks moved up and down the conquered terrain to avoid presenting static targets for the German artillery. Despite this many vehicles were hit, as they were in plain sight of German batteries on the surrounding hills. Flank assaults by Bavarian stormtroopers were repulsed. In the early evening, fresh infantry units together with the tanks conquered a sector of the third trench, marking the high tide of the French progress during the entire Second Battle of the Aisne. The Schneiders then withdrew, again suffering losses by artillery fire.

The Nivelle Offensive was a grave disappointment, demoralising the French troops and leading to the French Army Mutinies. The sense of failure extended to the Schneider tanks. Their losses had indeed been heavy: 76 of the 128 combat tanks engaged had been lost. Many of these had burnt: 57 in total, 31 with &quot;Groupement Bossut&quot; and 26 with &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot;. Most had been set on fire by German artillery: twenty-three vehicles of &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot; had been hit by indirect fire and fifteen of &quot;Groupement Bossut&quot;; this latter unit had fourteen tanks hit by direct fire. Investigations showed that most vehicles had carried additional fire-hazards: to compensate the limited range two fifty litre cans of petrol had been attached to the rear and some crews had even stowed a third one inside; sometimes explosive charges had been stowed outside; each tank had a bottle of ether to mix with the petrol to boost the engine and to enhance the fighting spirit three litres of strong liquor had been provided at the start of the battle. Also the personnel losses had been high: 180 of the 720 crew members, and 40% of the supporting infantry had become casualties. On a positive note, twenty broken-down tanks had been salvaged from the battlefield, all enemy infantry assaults had failed, and the spaced armour proved to be very resistant, beyond expectations, against small-arms fire and shell splinters. The main technical complaint was that visibility from within the vehicle was poor for the driver as well as the gunners. Tactical lessons drawn were that tanks should spread out more to avoid artillery fire and had to cooperate more closely with the infantry.

&quot;Groupement III&quot;, commanded by Captain Henri Lefebvre, was intended to assist an attack by the Fourth Army on 17 April at Moronvilliers. It consisted of two Schneider groups, AS 1 and AS 10, reinforced by some Saint-Chamond tanks. When the initial infantry attacks largely failed, the tank attack was cancelled, also in view of the events the previous day.

====Moulin-de-Laffaux====
Despite the general failure of the Nivelle Offensive and the ensuing mutinies, French High Command in May 1917 tried to make use of the force concentration at the Aisne by at least conquering the notorious Chemin-des-Dames positions. Part of the plan was a limited but strategically important objective: the German saillant east of Laffaux where the Hindenburg Line hinged on the Chemin-des-Dames, named after the hillock of the Moulin-de-Laffaux. This attack was to be supported by &quot;Groupement Lefebvre&quot;. To improve the cooperation with the infantry, the &quot;Groupement&quot; was reinforced by an infantry battalion specially trained in combined arms tactics, the &quot;17e Bataillon de Chasseurs à Pied&quot;. Coordination with the artillery was improved by attaching a special observation plane, protected by six SPAD VII fighters, that had to identify German antitank-batteries and have them destroyed by counterbattery fire; it also had to report the position of the tanks to higher command levels.

The more general offensive was launched on 5 May. Whereas most infantry attacks along the Chemin-des-Dames were bloody failures that day, the tank attack on the Moulin-de-Laffaux largely attained its objectives. The Schneiders, advancing not in column but &quot;line abreast&quot;, exploited the initial infantry conquest of the first trench by crossing the second and then assisted the foot soldiers in heavy and fluid battles with counterattacking German reserves. Eventually most tanks broke down and had to be left behind by the advancing infantry. Salvaging them proved difficult as thunderstorms made the surface of the in itself firm chalkstone of the area very slippery and the terrain was rough, dotted with ruins and intersected by ravines and quarries. The majority of the vehicles were repaired during the night, but the soil had so deteriorated that only a single battery of four was deployed on the sixth. Nevertheless, the Schneiders had made a good account of themselves. Of thirty-three tanks engaged only five had been destroyed, three of them Schneiders. Casualties among the crews numbered fifty-five, three of them fatal.

====La Malmaison====

In the wake of the mutinies Philippe Pétain was appointed supreme commander. He tried to restore confidence by abstaining from overambitious offensive plans. Only in 1918 when the influx of American troops and new armoured vehicles would tip the balance in favour of the Entente, could decisive attacks be considered. His motto was therefore: &quot;J&#x27;attends les Américains et les chars&quot; (&quot;I wait for the Americans and the tanks&quot;). However, remaining purely inactive would undermine the morale; to bolster it a series of meticulously prepared small-scale offensives were undertaken in which success was guaranteed by deploying an overwhelming numerical superiority, especially in artillery, to conquer a limited objective. On 23 October 1917 Pétain in one blow took the notorious Chemin-des-Dames crest, including the fortress of La Malmaison. The attack was supported by &quot;Groupement Chaubès&quot;, at the time consisting of AS 8, 11 and 12. Due to the losses in April, each AS now deployed twelve tanks. Including the supply vehicles the Schneider total numbered forty-one. The command vehicles of AS 11 and AS 12 were that day the first French tanks ever to use radio equipment in battle.

The tanks did not play a decisive role in this action. Because of the traffic jam, many were unable to even leave their own lines; many others broke down or got stuck in a marsh before reaching the enemy. Those that managed to engage however, effectively cooperated with the infantry. A ground fog largely hid the vehicles from enemy artillery and the spaced armour defeated German machine-gun &quot;Kerngeschoss&quot;-rounds. Losses were therefore low, with two tanks burnt and less than 10% personnel casualties. Six vehicles that had in May been abandoned at Moulin-de-Laffaux, could now be salvaged. Despite their modest contribution, the efficacy of the tanks seemed proven, justifying the planned expansion of the tank force. During the three 1917 battles, Schneider tanks engaged 175 enemy targets. Eighty-six vehicles were lost that year.

====The 1918 battles====

French command considered to launch large-scale summer offensives in 1918, benefiting from a grown number of AFVs. At this point of the war, less than a year after their first employment, the Schneider tanks were already considered obsolete. They nevertheless still formed an essential part of the tank force: a successor medium tank type, the Schneider Modèle 1917, had been cancelled; the light Renault FT had not been produced in sufficient numbers yet, especially the 75 mm cannon version; and the Saint-Chamond was of limited utility, so the Schneiders had to provide the necessary fire-power. Their continued importance became obvious when the French plans were on 21 March, at which date 245 Schneider tanks were operational, disrupted by the German spring offensive, a massive infantry onslaught made possible by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk allowing Germany to shift the bulk of its forces to the Western Front. In April there were minor counterattacks at the Somme by a small number of Schneider tanks: five vehicles on the 5th at Sauvillers-Mongival, six on the 7th at Grivesnes, and twelve on the 18th at the &quot;Bois de Sénécat&quot;, west of Castel. On 28 May, also at the Somme, twelve vehicles (AS 5) supported an American Expeditionary Forces attack in the Battle of Cantigny, the first time in history American troops cooperated with tanks. At first the German offensive was largely directed against the British Expeditionary Force but when this ultimately failed to produce the desired decisive breakthrough, late May the Germans turned in force on the French in the Third Battle of the Aisne. The German advance threatened the Champlieu base, which was abandoned, severely disrupting repair and maintenance. Early June the offensives had created a large French salient around Compiègne and Erich Ludendorff decided to reduce it in Operation Gneisenau. Soon for the French the situation became critical as a German success would open the way to Paris. On 11 June, tanks were for the first time used in mass for a mobile counterattack in the Battle of Matz. Although most of the vehicles involved were of the Saint-Chamond type, two Schneider &quot;Groupements&quot; (II and III) also participated with seventy-five tanks. The French armour concentration, hitting the flank of the enemy penetration, succeeded in halting the German advance and &quot;Gneisenau&quot; was cancelled. The success came at a price however: thirty-five Schneiders were lost. In the west of the salient on 9 July a small local counterattack took place named after the &quot;Porte&quot; and &quot;Des Loges&quot; farms, which was supported by about fifteen Schneider tanks of AS 16 and AS 17.

On 15 July the Germans began their last large 1918 offensive, attacking Rheims in the Second Battle of the Marne. Soon their advance faltered and they found themselves in a very vulnerable situation, with overextended supply lines and exhausted troops lacking well-entrenched positions. On 18 July French and American divisions, cooperating with a large number of tanks, started a major offensive, the Battle of Soissons, in which for the first time since 1914 Entente forces on the Western Front succeeded in making substantial progress, reducing the entire German salient created in the Third Battle of the Aisne. In the operation three Schneider &quot;Groupements&quot; (I, III and IV) participated with 123 vehicles, the second largest deployment of the type during the war. The battle was a strategic disaster for the Germans, leading to the disintegration of a large part of their forces and initiating a period of almost continuous retreats. Although now at last the conditions were favourable to fulfil the offensive role for which they had been created, the Schneider tanks could not be of much assistance to the itself also decimated French infantry. By 1 August 1918 the number of operational Schneider CA tanks had dropped to fifty. As production was halted that month, losses could not be replaced, whereas the intensified fighting resulted in a much-increased wear. As a consequence, effective levels remained low: forty vehicles on 1 September, sixty on 1 October, fifty-one on 1 November. Accordingly, in subsequent operations the Schneiders never again equalled the numbers reached in July. On 16 August three groups with thirty-two tanks attacked near Tilloloy; on 20 August one group of twelve participated in actions near Nampcel. On 12 September &quot;Groupement IV&quot; could muster twenty-four tanks to support the Americans in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. From 26 September during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive &quot;Groupement IV&quot; continued to support the Americans with about twenty-two tanks, and &quot;Groupements&quot; I and III supported the French Fourth Army with thirty-four vehicles. During October most Schneider units were recuperating and German intelligence assumed the type had now been completely phased out, replaced by the newer and more effective Renault FT tanks, but in fact it was planned to again deploy about fifty Schneiders in a large offensive in Lorraine to begin on 11 November. That day however, the First World War ended as the Armistice with Germany was concluded. During the 1918 battles, Schneider tanks engaged 473 enemy targets. In the war, in total 121 Schneider tanks had been lost, 86 in 1917 and 35 in 1918: 114 by enemy artillery fire, three by mines, three by antitank rifle fire and one by unknown causes.

==Later designs: the Schneider CA2, CA3 and CA4==
The first projects to create new variants were based on the original Schneider CA design. On 27 September 1916 Estienne wrote a memorandum to the General Headquarters outlining his thoughts about a possible command tank. Considering that tank units would not only attack static enemy positions but also had to manoeuvre on the battlefield against moving hostile troops, he foresaw that their commanders would need more agile vehicles with armament and armour concentrated in the front, to lead a pursuit or cover a retreat. Therefore, a variant was needed fitted with a turret featuring a 37 mm gun and one or two machine-guns in the front instead of the sides, protected by 15 mm front armour, with a crew of four and with a top speed of at least 10 km/h. Fifty such vehicles should be constructed. On 2 October, Joffre demanded the production of fifty &quot;voitures cuirassées de commandement&quot;. On 13 October Schneider had a paper design ready; on 17 October the order was confirmed by Mourret. Towards the end of 1916 a &quot;mock-up&quot; was ready under the designation of Schneider CA2. On 26 and 27 March 1917 a prototype made of boiler-plate, perhaps identical to the &quot;mock-up&quot;, was tested at Marly. It had the standard suspension of the Schneider CA but its hull was significantly shortened so that the overhanging nose had disappeared. The 75 mm cannon had been replaced by a cylindrical turret, intended to be armed with a 47 mm gun and a machine-gun, close to the rear of the hull. The hull was further diminished in size and weight by a considerable narrowing, and closing of the roofed skylight slit, which lowered its height. As a result, the type weighed only eight tonnes. During the testing the vehicle, though no longer getting itself stuck on an overhanging nose, still proved unable to climb out of muddy shell craters. It was concluded that the suspension should be lengthened by the equivalence of three track links, about forty centimetres, and on 13 April 1917 a quick commencement of production was envisaged. In reality Estienne had already on 22 March decided to discontinue this project in favour of a Renault FT command (&quot;signal&quot;) version. The CA2 prototype was subsequently used as a training and test bed vehicle and the immediate need for command vehicles was met by fitting two standard Schneider CAs with radio sets. On 29 December 1916 it was proposed to develop from the Schneider CA2 two light tank prototypes.

Early 1917 it was suggested to construct some vehicles as flamethrower tanks by installing a flamethrowing device in two armoured turrets, one at the left front corner and the other at the right rear corner, each having a field of fire of about 180°. The fuel reservoirs would be inside the hull. No production resulted. In February 1917, Schneider proposed to build a variant with a thirty-two centimetres wider hull fitted in the front with a 47 mm gun and two machine-gun turrets placed diagonally behind the driver position, while the engine was relocated to the rear of the vehicle. On 2 April 1917 the Ministry of Armament asked Schneider to design two improved versions of the Schneider CA: one with a gun turret, the calibre not surpassing 47 mm if it were a long gun; the other with a long 75 mm gun in the front of the hull.

After the failure of the Nivelle Offensive, Schneider understood that more capable designs had to be manufactured if the tank were to remain a viable weapon system. On 1 May 1917 it discussed a range of possible options, numbered one to five. All had in common that basically the same mechanical components were used as with the Schneider CA, though often improved, and that the suspension was only partially changed: elongated by the addition of an eighth road wheel and using thirty-five instead of thirty-three wider, forty-five centimetres broad, track links. However, all were also significantly modernised: the hull overhang had disappeared, the hull front formed as a sloped wedge, and the inner space was compartmentalised, with an engine room, protruding behind the sprocket, at the back and the driver in front. The armour base was about sixteen to twenty millimetres. The first two proposals were probably identical to the April 1917 projects and discarded by the company as inferior. The last three, favoured by Schneider itself, were all turreted vehicles: design No 3 had a 47 mm gun in the hull and a single machine-gun turret; No 4 differed in having two machine-gun turrets and No 5 in having the gun moved to a turret. During discussions about these proposals, Estienne pointed out that the intended long 47 mm gun had not entered production yet and that no high performance explosive charge was available to give it a sufficient effect on soft targets. Therefore, he insisted on fitting the standard 75 mm field gun, even if this would raise weight to 14.5 tonnes. A week later Schneider presented proposal No 6, which envisaged a vehicle weighing fourteen tonnes and having a shortened 75 mm gun in the turret. On 5 July 1917 drawings were ready of the type, which was now called the Schneider CA3. However, these included an alternative version with a shortened 75 mm gun in the hull. Estienne had misgivings about this project, questioning its trench-crossing capacity and predicting engine power would be insufficient, given a weight that had by now reached 16.6 tonnes. Also he demanded a gun sight allowing some fire-on-the-move capability. Nevertheless, on 24 July the Consultative Committee of the &quot;Artillerie Spéciale&quot; decided that the four hundred vehicles of the Schneider Modèle 1917 ordered on 10 May 1917, were to be of the CA3 type. These had to be delivered from May 1918 onwards. A prototype was ordered of each version — the mechanical parts in May and the armour hulls in July — but the company itself limited its construction activities to the one with the gun in the hull, probably because a cannon turret was judged to be &quot;absurd&quot; given the lack of enemy tanks and a machine gun turret was seen as necessary for close defence against infantry assault. Later that year, in an official answer to an inquiry by parliamentarian Paul Doumer regarding the progress achieved within French tank development, the designation &quot;Schneider CA4&quot; is used to indicate a design studied within the context of a larger order for two prototypes, weighing twenty tonnes and fitted with a cannon turret armed with the shortened 75 mm gun, and of which Schneider is unable to predict when the single prototype to be constructed would be finished, though deliveries could start in April 1918. A mock-up was built of the Schneider CA3, and on 24 October the chassis was tested at SOMUA. During the summer however, Estienne and Pétain had become worried that the medium tank production might become an obstacle to the planned light tank mass production of the Renault FT. On 27 October the committee advised that the construction of the Schneider CA3 would be suspended in favour of light tank production. It argued that the type could probably not be delivered before August 1918 anyway, too late for the summer offensives of that year, and that an improved medium tank design should be taken into development instead. The ultimate decision not to produce the Schneider CA3 was only taken in February 1918. On 19 January 1918 it was proposed that the preproduced CA3 components would be used to construct a further two hundred Schneider artillery tractors. On 3 November 1917 the order for the Schneider CA4 prototype was annulled. The new medium tank project had already been started on 15 August 1917 and strived for a technically advanced seventeen tonne vehicle armed with a shortened 75 mm gun and benefiting from a much improved mobility. It remained a paper project.

Sometimes projects of a more general investigative nature considered to employ Schneider CA hulls. In January 1917, engineer Louis Boirault proposed an articulated tank, a vehicle that would be long enough to cross wide trenches and yet sufficiently flexible to maintain mobility. Older literature sometimes suggested that he actually coupled two Schneiders rear to rear to research this concept. In fact, this was on 8 May 1917 merely advised by the committee judging the merits of the proposal, as a lighter alternative for Boirault&#x27;s original plans which envisaged three hulls of a completely new design. The Schneider company would subsequently refuse to make any vehicles available and the project was continued based on the Saint-Chamond hull.

== Aftermath ==

===France===

Even before the end of the war, on 6 October 1918 Estienne had proposed to phase out all Schneider tanks from operational units, remove their armament and deploy them as instruction and recovery vehicles. These should be distinguished from those vehicles that from the very beginning had been used as supply tanks, with the cannon removed and the hole plated over. Indeed, by the end of 1918, all surviving Schneider tanks had been given the destination of utility vehicles, although it is unknown to what extent and at what rate any rebuilding took place. On 1 December 1918 &quot;Groupements&quot; I and IV fused with Renault FT units and &quot;Groupement&quot; II and III, together with AS 9 from &quot;Groupement I&quot;, reformed into three new &quot;Groupements Lourds&quot; (I, II and III) equipped with the British Mark V* type. Some of the still serviceable Schneiders were rebuilt as recovery vehicles and tank transporters serving with Renault FT units. In 1928 a project was presented for a Schneider CA Modèle 1928 recovery tank with the upper hull replaced by a motorised crane, that could be stabilised by a large jack at the rear of the vehicle.

====Last surviving Schneider CA====

The only surviving exemplar of the Schneider CA, at the Musée des Blindés in Saumur, is also the world&#x27;s oldest tank in full running condition. It was donated at the end of the war by the French government to the United States of America, was preserved in the Aberdeen Proving Ground Ordnance Museum in Maryland, USA and in 1985 again donated to France for restoration. The tank&#x27;s original four cylinder Schneider gasoline engine and the original transmissions were fully restored to original working condition by the repair teams at the &quot;Musée des Blindés&quot;. This particular vehicle had been fitted with later upgrades, such as the fuel reservoirs located at its rear.

====Last surviving Schneider CD====

The last surviving example of the artillery tractor variant of this vehicle is currently in the possession of the France 40 Association.

===Italy===
Italy in the summer of 1918 formed its first tank unit, the &quot;Reparto speciale di marcia carri d&#x27;assalto&quot;, with one Schneider and three Renault FT tanks; the Schneider tank was replaced in November 1918 with a FIAT 2000.

=== Spain ===

On one occasion after the war phased out Schneider tanks were exported. After an urgent request by the Spanish government following serious defeats against Berber rebels in the Rif War, six were sold to Spain on 16 September 1921 within the context of a joint French–Spanish effort to subdue the newly independent Rif Republic. The vehicles were designated &quot;Carro de Asalto Schneider M16&quot; and modified by the addition of a driver&#x27;s visor annex gun port in the front glacis plate. They reached Morocco on 28 February 1922. On 14 March 1922, as the first Spanish tanks to see combat action ever, they provided close support fire. Seen primarily as mobile artillery, they were combined into an artillery assault battery commanded by Captain Carlos Ruiz de Toledo which supported the single Renault FT company. In September 1925 they took part in the major amphibious landings in the bay of Al Hoceima. The Schneider tanks saw action until May 1926 and returned to Spain in 1929, not having lost a single vehicle. In Spain, due to their poor mechanical state, they were delegated to a reserve status and used as training and instruction vehicles. Four were part of the depot of the &quot;Regimiento Ligero de Carros de Combate N° 1&quot; at Madrid, a Renault FT unit, the other two were part of the depot strength of RLCC N° 2 at Zaragoza, the other Renault FT unit. At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the first unit remained under Republican command, while the second took the side of the Nationalist rebels. The Madrid vehicles saw some action during the bloody attacks on the Cuartel de la Montaña, the main military barracks of the capital. Some of the tanks were manned by militia members of the &quot;Unión General de Trabajadores&quot; and the &quot;Unión de Hermanos Proletarios&quot;. Also the Zaragoza vehicles participated in the initial fighting. Probably all Schneider tanks became inoperational during 1936.

===China ===
According to an English military observer named Impey, the Fengtian Army had a number of Schneider tanks by 1925.

<text>Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists and a designation by Wassily Kandinsky and Franz Marc for their exhibition and publication activities, in which both artists acted as sole editors in the almanac of the same name (first published in mid-May 1912). The editorial team organized two exhibitions in Munich in 1911 and 1912 to demonstrate their art-theoretical ideas based on the works of art exhibited. Traveling exhibitions in German and other European cities followed. &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; disbanded at the start of World War I in 1914.

The artists associated with &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; were important pioneers of modern art of the 20th century; they formed a loose network of relationships, but not an art group in the narrower sense like Die Brücke (The Bridge) in Dresden. The work of the affiliated artists is assigned to German Expressionism.

==History==
The forerunner of &quot;The Blue Rider&quot; was the Neue Künstlervereinigung München (N.K.V.M: New Artists&#x27; Association Munich), instigated by Marianne von Werefkin, Alexej von Jawlensky, Adolf Erbslöh and German entrepreneur, art collector, aviation pioneer and musician . The N.K.V.M was co-founded in 1909 and Kandinsky (as its first chairman) organized the exhibitions of 1909 and 1910. Even before the first exhibition, Kandinsky introduced the so-called &quot;four square meter clause&quot; into the statutes of the N.K.V.M due to a difference of opinion with the painter Charles Johann Palmié; this clause would give Kandinsky the lever to leave the N.K.V.M in 1911. 

There were repeated disputes among the conservative forces in the N.K.V.M, which flared up due to Kandinsky&#x27;s increasingly abstract painting. In December 1911, Kandinsky submitted &quot;Composition V&quot; for the association&#x27;s third exhibition, but the jury rejected the painting. In response, Kandinsky, along with Münter, Marc, and others, formed a rival group and quickly organised a parallel exhibition at the same venue, the Thannhauser Gallery, in rooms adjacent to the official show. This breakaway group adopted the name &quot;Der Blaue Reiter.&quot;

Years later, Kandinsky recalled anticipating the controversy and having already prepared extensive material for the new group&#x27;s exhibition: &quot;Our halls were close to the rooms of the NKVM exhibition. It was a sensation. Since I anticipated the &#x27;noise&#x27; in good time, I had prepared a wealth of exhibition material for the BR [Blaue Reiter]. So the two exhibitions took place simultaneously. (…) Revenge was sweet!&quot;. The exhibition was officially titled the &quot;First Exhibition of the Editorial Board of Der Blaue Reiter&quot;, reflecting Kandinsky and Marc&#x27;s plans to publish an art almanac under the same name.

Kandinsky resigned as chairmanship of the N.K.V.M. on 10 January 1911 but remained in the association as a simple member. His successor was Adolf Erbslöh. In June, Kandinsky developed plans for his activities outside of the N.K.V.M. He intended to publish a &quot;kind of almanac&quot; which could be called &quot;Die Kette&quot; (&quot;The Chain&quot;). On 19 June, he pitched his idea to Marc and won him over by offering him the co-editing of the book.
The name of the movement is the title of a painting that Kandinsky created in 1903, but it is unclear whether it is the origin of the name of the movement as Professor Klaus Lankheit learned that the title of the painting had been overwritten. Kandinsky wrote 20 years later that the name is derived from Marc&#x27;s enthusiasm for horses and Kandinsky&#x27;s love of riders, combined with a shared love of the color blue. For Kandinsky, blue was the color of spirituality; the darker the blue, the more it awakened human desire for the eternal (as he wrote in his 1911 book &quot;On the Spiritual in Art&quot;).

Within the group, artistic approaches and aims varied from artist to artist; however, the artists shared a common desire to express spiritual truths through their art. They believed in the promotion of modern art; the connection between visual art and music; the spiritual and symbolic associations of color; and a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting. Members were interested in European medieval art and primitivism, as well as the contemporary, non-figurative art scene in France. As a result of their encounters with Cubist, Fauvist and Rayonist ideas, they moved towards abstraction.

&quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; organized exhibitions in 1911 and 1912 that toured Germany. They also published an almanac featuring contemporary, primitive and folk art, along with children&#x27;s paintings. In 1913, they exhibited in the first German Herbstsalon.

The group was disrupted by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914. Franz Marc and August Macke were killed in combat. Wassily Kandinsky returned to Russia, and Marianne von Werefkin and Alexej von Jawlensky fled to Switzerland. There were also differences in opinion within the group. As a result, Der Blaue Reiter was short-lived, lasting for only three years from 1911 to 1914.

In 1923, Kandinsky, Feininger, Klee and Alexej von Jawlensky formed the group &quot;Die Blaue Vier&quot; (&quot;The Blue Four&quot;) at the instigation of painter and art dealer Galka Scheyer. Scheyer organized &quot;Blue Four&quot; exhibitions in the United States from 1924 onward.

An extensive collection of paintings by &quot;Der Blaue Reiter&quot; is exhibited in the Städtische Galerie in the Lenbachhaus in Munich.

== Almanac ==

Conceived in June 1911, &quot;Der Blaue Reiter Almanach&quot; (&quot;The Blue Rider Almanac&quot;) was published in early 1912 by Piper in an edition that sold approximately 1100 copies; on 11 May, Franz Marc received the first print. The volume was edited by Kandinsky and Marc; its costs were underwritten by the industrialist and art collector Bernhard Koehler, a relative of Macke. It contained reproductions of more than 140 artworks, and 14 major articles. A second volume was planned, but the start of World War I prevented it. Instead, a second edition of the original was printed in 1914, again by Piper.

The contents of the &quot;Almanac&quot; included:

* Marc&#x27;s essay &quot;Spiritual Treasures,&quot; illustrated with children&#x27;s drawings, German woodcuts, Chinese paintings, and Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Woman with Mandolin at the Piano&quot;
* an article by French critic Roger Allard on Cubism
* Arnold Schoenberg&#x27;s article &quot;The Relationship to the Text&quot;, and a facsimile of his song &quot;Herzgewächse&quot;
* facsimiles of song settings by Alban Berg and Anton Webern
* Thomas de Hartmann&#x27;s essay &quot;Anarchy in Music&quot;
* an article by Leonid Sabaneyev about Alexander Scriabin
* an article by Erwin von Busse on Robert Delaunay, illustrated with a print of his &quot;The Window on the City&quot;
* an article by Vladimir Burliuk on contemporary Russian art
* Macke&#x27;s essay &quot;Masks&quot;
* Kandinsky&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Question of Form&quot;
* Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;On Stage Composition&quot;
* Kandinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Sound&quot;.

The art reproduced in the &quot;Almanac&quot; marked a dramatic turn away from a Eurocentric and conventional orientation. The selection was dominated by primitive, folk and children&#x27;s art, with pieces from the South Pacific and Africa, Japanese drawings, medieval German woodcuts and sculpture, Egyptian puppets, Russian folk art, and Bavarian religious art painted on glass. The five works by Van Gogh, Cézanne, and Gauguin were outnumbered by seven from Henri Rousseau and thirteen from child artists.

==Exhibitions==
===First exhibition===

On December 18, 1911, the &quot;First exhibition of the editorial board of Der Blaue Reiter&quot; (&quot;Erste Ausstellung der Redaktion Der Blaue Reiter&quot;) opened at the Heinrich Thannhauser&#x27;s Moderne Galerie in Munich, running through the first days of 1912. 43 works by 14 artists were shown: paintings by Henri Rousseau, Albert Bloch, David Burliuk, Wladimir Burliuk, Heinrich Campendonk, Robert Delaunay, Elisabeth Epstein, Eugen von Kahler, Wassily Kandinsky, August Macke, Franz Marc, Gabriele Münter, Jean Bloé Niestlé and Arnold Schoenberg, and an illustrated catalogue edited.

<text>Paul Alan Hunter (14 October 1978 – 9 October 2006) was an English professional snooker player. He was a three-time Masters champion, winning the event in 2001, 2002, and 2004; on all three occasions, he recovered from a deficit in the final to claim the title on a . He also won three ranking events: the Welsh Open in 1998 and 2002, and the 2002 British Open.

Hunter was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumours in March 2005, but he continued to play for several months after receiving the diagnosis. He died shortly before his 28th birthday in October 2006. A tournament in Fürth, Germany, was renamed the Paul Hunter Classic in his memory, and he was posthumously awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award. In April 2016, the Masters trophy was renamed the Paul Hunter Trophy. He made 114 century breaks in professional competition, the highest of these a 146 in the 2004 Premier League tournament. During the 200405 season, Hunter attained a career-high ranking of world number four.

==Early life==
Paul Alan Hunter was born on 14 October 1978 in Leeds, England, where he attended the Cardinal Heenan High School. Hunter played alongside his father, Alan, at a young age and won many amateur junior events, including the English Doubles Championship, which he won aged 14 with fellow Yorkshireman Richard Brooke. After leaving school at 14 to spend more time playing snooker, he often travelled to Bradford to practise alongside professional players such as Joe Johnson. Hunter was the runner-up at the 1995 English Amateur Championship, losing 78 to David Gray in the final. He made his professional debut in July 1995 at age 16, with the help of his mentors Johnson and Jimmy Michie.

== Career ==
=== Early career (1995–2000) ===
Four months after making his professional debut, Hunter reached the second round of the 1995 UK Championship by defeating Alan McManus, the sixth highest ranked player in the snooker world rankings, 94. Aged 17, he reached the semi-finals of the 1996 Welsh Open, the youngest player to appear at this stage of a ranking event, by defeating the world champion Stephen Hendry in the last 16. He also reached the quarter-finals of the 1996 UK Championship, where he completed a of Willie Thorne 90, and bested James Wattana 95 and Terry Murphy 97, before losing 59 against Hendry, the eventual winner of the event. Due in part to this performance, Hunter was awarded a wildcard to play at the 1997 Masters, where he lost 15 against Mark Williams in the first round. He reached the last 16 stage of the 1997 Grand Prix, but was later disqualified for testing positive for cannabis. He was fined £4,550 and docked the entirety of the ranking points he had earned at the event.

The following year, Hunter won his first ranking tournament at the 1998 Welsh Open; after eliminating Paul Wykes 53, Neal Foulds 52, Steve Davis 53, Nigel Bond 54, Alan McManus 53, and Peter Ebdon 61, he defeated John Higgins 95 in the final. Hunter trailed 24 but won seven from the next eight to win the match and the Welsh Open title. He also reached the semi-finals of the 1998 UK Championship, defeating both Jimmy White and Davis, before losing to Higgins. For 1998, he was named the Snooker Writers Association&#x27;s Young Player of the Year.

Hunter played in the main stage of the World Snooker Championship for the first time in 1999, after qualifying against Euan Henderson. He then lost 810 in the first round to Hendry, the eventual champion. Hunter&#x27;s performance that season elevated him to 12th in the 19992000 world rankings, allowing him automatic qualification into the final stages of ranking events for the first time. He retained his good form for the 200001 season, reaching at least the quarter-final stage in five ranking tournaments: he was a runner-up at the 2001 Welsh Open, a semi-finalist at the British Open and Scottish Open, and a quarter-finalist at the Grand Prix and China Open.

=== Masters winner (2001–2004) ===
Ranked amongst the world&#x27;s top 16 players in 200001, Hunter gained entry into the invitational Masters tournament. At the 2001 Masters, he eliminated the defending champion Matthew Stevens 65 in the first round, Peter Ebdon 63 in the quarter-finals, and Stephen Hendry 64 in the semi-finals. He then met Fergal O&#x27;Brien in the final; Hunter trailed 37 but won seven of the next nine frames to win 109. After winning the Masters title, Hunter claimed that he and his fiancée had had sex during the when he was trailing 26, which had caused him to play significantly better.

At the following year&#x27;s Masters, he defeated Stephen Lee 63, Ebdon 65 and Alan McManus 65 to reach the final, where he met Mark Williams. Despite losing the first five frames of the final, Hunter won the match and tournament on a 109. He was only the third player to retain the Masters title, after Cliff Thorburn (19851986) and Hendry (19891993). Hunter won his second ranking event the same year, defeating Ken Doherty 92 in the final to win the 2002 Welsh Open. He lost to Quinten Hann in the first round of the 2002 World Championship. In November, he defeated Ian McCulloch 94 in the final of the 2002 British Open to win the third ranking event of his career. As the defending champion at the 2003 Masters, Hunter progressed to the semi-finals but lost 36 to Williams.

Hunter progressed past the second round of the World Championship for the first time in 2003. He defeated Ali Carter 105, Stevens 136 and defending champion Ebdon 1312 to reach the semi-finals. In the best-of-33 frames semi-final, Hunter established an overnight lead of 159 over opponent Doherty. Despite leading by six frames, he won only one of the remaining nine, and lost 1617. Years later, the BBC broadcast the highlights of the match alongside other memorable matches in place of the 2020 World Championship, which was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Hunter&#x27;s progress in the World Championship helped earn him a place in the world&#x27;s top eight in the 200304 rankings for the first time in his career, having been ranked number nine for the previous two seasons.

In 2003–04, Hunter won the Masters for the third time in four years. He trailed Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan throughout the final, with scores of 16, 27, 68, and 79, but took the remaining three frames to win 109. Hunter compiled five century breaks in the match. The 2004 Masters final was voted one of the best matches of all time by Eurosport in 2020. Hunter reached his last ranking event final at the 2004 Players Championship, but lost 79 against Jimmy White. At the 2004 Premier League Snooker event, he made the highest of his career, a 146 in a 35 loss to Marco Fu. He reached the second round of the 2004 World Championship, where he lost 1213 against Stevens, despite leading 106 and 1210.

Hunter began the 2004–05 season by reaching the semi-finals of the Grand Prix, where he lost 36 to O&#x27;Sullivan. He won the 2004 Fürth Grand Prix, a pro-am competition, defeating Stevens 42 in the final; the event was later renamed in Hunter&#x27;s honour. He reached the quarter-finals of the 2005 China Open in March 2005, just days after being diagnosed with cancer. His career-high ranking was world number four during 200405, which dropped to number five the following season.

=== Later years and illness (2005–2006) ===
In April 2005, Hunter was diagnosed with malignant neuroendocrine tumours in his stomach, a rare disease, the cause of which is unknown. A spokesperson for the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) said at the time: &quot;Paul will undergo treatment to cure himself of this illness. He would like to reassure his fans and supporters that, as with his snooker career, he is tenacious and positive in his fight against the disease.&quot; Hunter received chemotherapy for his illness.

Hunter returned to the circuit for the start of the 2005–06 season but lost to Rory McLeod in the first round of the Grand Prix. Hunter&#x27;s next match of the season was at the 2005 UK Championship against Jamie Burnett, in which Hunter came back from 68 down to win the match 98. Despite this, Hunter lost in the next round 29 against eventual champion Ding Junhui. He lost in the first round of the 2006 World Championship 5–10 to Neil Robertson, which was his last professional match.

Slipping from 5th to 34th in the 200607 rankings, Hunter admitted he played worse than the previous year and confirmed that he had been in continuous pain. Following a members&#x27; vote on 27 July 2006, the WPBSA announced its rules would be changed to allow Hunter to sit out the entire 2006–07 snooker season with his world ranking frozen at 34. Hunter intended to devote the year to treatment for his cancer.

== Death and legacy ==
Hunter died on 9 October 2006, aged 27, at the Kirkwood Hospice in Huddersfield. Prior to the Premier League Snooker matches on 12 October 2006, players, referees and commentators stood for a moment of silence to remember Hunter. His funeral took place on 19 October 2006 at Leeds Parish Church. Many snooker players attended the ceremony, and his best friend, Matthew Stevens, was a pallbearer at the service.

Following his death, fellow professionals Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams, Jimmy White, Matthew Stevens and Ken Doherty led immediate calls for the Masters trophy to be named in Hunter&#x27;s memory. The idea was ruled out at the time, but in 2007 the then-non-ranking Fürth German Open, a tournament first won by Hunter in 2004, was renamed the Paul Hunter Classic in his honour. The same year, the amateur English Open tournament was renamed the Paul Hunter English Open. On 20 April 2016, the World Snooker chairman Barry Hearn committed to renaming the Masters trophy in Hunter&#x27;s honour, stating that the organisation had &quot;messed up&quot; by not doing so sooner.

Hunter was posthumously awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Helen Rollason Award in 2006, and his widow Lindsey accepted the award on his behalf. A registered charity called The Paul Hunter Foundation was set up after his death with the &quot;specific aim of giving disadvantaged, able bodied and disabled youngsters an opportunity to play snooker&quot;. 

Noted for his &quot;flamboyant&quot; and &quot;fluent&quot; style by snooker commentator Clive Everton, Hunter was also described as being unfazed by bad luck or playing conditions by commentator Phil Yates, and Barry Hearn said that Hunter&#x27;s &quot;mercurial talent&quot; was a &quot;sad loss&quot; to the sport. Over his 11-year professional career, Hunter&#x27;s total prize money was £1.53 million. He compiled 114 century breaks in professional competition, including a high break of 146.

== Personal life ==
Hunter married Lindsey Fell, a beauty therapist, in August 2004 in Jamaica. The couple had one daughter, born on 26 December 2005. After his death, Lindsey wrote the memoir &quot;Unbreakable: My Life with Paul – a Story of Extraordinary Courage and Love&quot;, covering his snooker career, his personal life and his death. Hunter became known as the &quot;Beckham of the Baize&quot;, a reference to football player David Beckham.

<text>In a road bicycle race, the peloton (, originally meaning ) is the main group or pack of riders. Riders in a group save energy by riding close (drafting or slipstreaming) to (particularly behind) other riders. The reduction in drag is dramatic; riding in the middle of a well-developed group, drag can be reduced by as much as 95%. Exploitation of this potential energy saving leads to complex cooperative and competitive interactions between riders and teams in race tactics. The term is also used to refer to the community of professional cyclists in general.

==Definition==
More formally, a peloton is defined as &quot;two or more cyclists riding in sufficiently close proximity to be located either in one of two basic positions: (1) behind cyclists in zones of reduced air pressure, referred to as ‘drafting’, or (2) in non-drafting positions where air pressure is highest. Cyclists in drafting zones expend less energy than in front positions.&quot; A peloton has similarly been defined &quot;as a group of cyclists that are coupled together through the mutual energy benefits of drafting, whereby cyclists follow others in zones of reduced air resistance.&quot; A peloton is a complex system, which means that collective behavior emerges from simple rules of cyclists&#x27; interactions.

==Formations==

Pelotons are typically observed during bicycle races in which drafting is permitted, although pelotons also form from cyclist commuter traffic. Pelotons travel as an integrated unit in which each rider makes positional adjustments in response to the movements of adjacent riders and those ahead. Riders at the front are fully exposed to wind resistance, hence they experience higher fatigue loads than riders in drafting positions. After a period of time in front, leading riders maneuver farther back in the peloton to a drafting position to recover. Thus the peloton is in fluid motion as a continuous rotation of riders push from the back through to the leading edge, then falling away. Like bird flocks, peloton-like behavior that involves drafting or similar energy-saving mechanisms has been identified in a variety of biological systems.

The shape or formation of the peloton changes according to multiple factors. Comparatively high power output efforts due to high-speeds on flat topography, a strong headwind or inclines (hills) tends to spread out or lengthen the formation, often into single file. A slow pace or brisk tailwind in which cyclists&#x27; power outputs are low result in compact formations such that riders ride side-by-side, often filling roads from one side to the other. When two or more groups of riders have reason to contest control of the peloton, several lines may form, each seeking to impose debilitating fatigue on the other teams. Fatigue is a decisive factor in the outcome of every race. Cyclists&#x27; range of peripheral vision is a significant factor in peloton formation.

Thus these formations comprise two main phases of behavior: a compact, low-speed formation, and a single-file, high-speed formation. Peloton phases are indicated by thresholds in collective output that can be modeled mathematically and computationally. The principles of phase behavior identified by Trenchard et al. have been applied to optimize engineering problems.

Similarly, these thresholds in peloton formations define transitions between peloton cooperative behavior and free-riding behavior. Cooperation and free-riding in pelotons have been studied using game theory and as a social dilemma, and have also been considered in terms of equivalencies to aspects of economic theory.

Basic peloton behaviors have also been modelled with robots, and principles of peloton behavior have also been considered in relation to the future of collective robot behavior.

==Models and simulations==

===Olds&#x27; model===

Olds&#x27; analysis involved peloton breakaway and chasing groups. He identified the factors involved in determining the likelihood that a breakaway group would succeed in reaching the finish ahead of chasing groups. He identified the following critical factors: distance remaining in the race, the speed of the breakaway group, the number of riders in both the breakaway and chasing groups, how closely riders draft each other, course gradient and roughness, and headwinds and crosswinds (referred to as &quot;demand&quot; factors). Introducing riders&#x27; physiological variables including metabolic power production and time to exhausion (&quot;supply&quot; factors), Olds&#x27; presents an iterative algorithm for determining the mean power of each group and their relative times to exhaustion, thus determining whether the chasers will catch the breakaway.

Olds&#x27; key findings include that group mean velocity increases rapidly as a function of group size up to five or six riders, and then continues to increase but only gradually up to about 20 cyclists; wheel spacing is a significant determinant of group speed due to drafting advantages; mean velocity falls as a function of distance remaining; the required lead time for a breakaway group falls rapidly as the number in the breakaway group increases up to about 10 riders, but flattens as the number of riders in the breakaway group approaches the number of riders in the chasing group. Similarly, Olds&#x27; observed that if the chase-group size is less than the size of the breakaway group and the wheel spacing among the chasers is greater than 3 meters, a chasing group will never catch a lead group, assuming other factors remain constant between the groups.

===Hoenigman et al.&#x27;s model===

Agent-based computer models allow for any number of independent &quot;agents&quot; with assigned attributes to interact according to programmed rules of behavior. In this way, simulated global behaviors emerge which can be studied for their properties and compared with actual systems. For their cyclist agents, Hoenigman et al. assigned individual maximum-power-outputs over a heterogeneous range among peloton cyclists and individual and team cooperative attributes in which agents share the most costly front position, or defect by seeking lower-cost drafting positions within the peloton, both according to some probabality. Hoenigman et al. introduced power equations from the literature for non-drafting and drafting positions, an approximate anaerobic threshold as a percentage of cyclists&#x27; maximum power when traveling alone without drafting, and a time-to-exhaustion parameter. The authors also introduced a &quot;breakaway&quot; state in which defecting riders increase their speeds to a higher threshold either to breakaway or to catch a group ahead.

The authors performed experiments by varying the noted parameters over a simulated flat road race containing 15 teams of 10 riders. Cooperators (those willing to take the most costly front position) spend 5 minutes at the front, then rotate to the back of the pack. Defectors spend only one minute at the front. As the race approaches the end, strategies change such that each agent increases their output incrementally based on their remaining energy up to 100% of their maximum power output. Results of the model shows that weaker riders are better off defecting, while cooperation is a good strategy for stronger riders. The results are realistic when compared with real-world competitive cycling and demonstrate the effectiveness of this kind of agent-based model which facilitates accurate identification and analysis of underlying principles of system (in this case, peloton) behavior.

===Erick Ratamero&#x27;s simulation===
In his 2013 agent-based peloton simulation, Erick Ratamero applied Wilenski&#x27;s agent-based flocking model that incorporates three main dynamical parameters: alignment, separation and cohesion. Wilenski&#x27;s model originates from Craig Reynolds&#x27; flocking model that incorporates the same parameters, which he described as velocity matching, collision avoidance, and flock centering.

Ratamaro then applied Sayama&#x27;s algorithm for cohesive and separating forces to adjust agents&#x27; acceleration based on their proportionate spacing within a defined field of vision. Ratamero then introduced cyclists&#x27; energetic parameters, adopting elements of Olds&#x27; equations for cyclists&#x27; energy expenditure, and cyclist performance results from Hoenigman, and Kyle&#x27;s drafting equation. Ratamero then introduced a threshold energetic quantity to simulate the lactate threshold derived from Hoenigman, whereby cyclist-agents which expend energy above this level will fatigue and eventually fall back in position within the simulated peloton. Thus cyclist-agents expend their energy differentially within the peloton based on their positions and proximity to drafting positions.

Ratamero&#x27;s model demonstrates that cyclists tend to expend energy more efficiently by participating in well-organized lines in which cyclists advance toward the front, even though they might spend more time in front non-drafting positions than some cyclists internal to the peloton whose continual positional adjustments may result in less time in optimal drafting positions. Ratamero&#x27;s model exhibits self-organized convection-like behavior which Trenchard described as a phase of peloton behavior.

===Trenchard et al.&#x27;s simulation===
In their 2015 agent-based peloton simulation, Trenchard et al. applied Ratamero&#x27;s dynamical model, but introduced a different way of modelling the energetic relationships between cyclist-agents. Whereas Ratamero applied a constant maximal sustainable output for all cyclists who then lose energy differentially according to their proximity to drafting positions, Trenchard et al. introduced different maximal sustainable capacities for each cyclist-agent whose positions are determined by the proportion of their maximal capacities to that of the front rider who sets the speed of the peloton. For this they apply the equation:

:PCR = [Pfront - [Pfront ⋅ (1 - d)]] / MSOfollow

where PCR is the &quot;peloton convergence ratio&quot;, describing two coupled riders; the non-drafting front-rider sets the pace, while the follower obtains the drafting benefit of reduced power output at the same speed as the front rider. Two-cyclist coupling generalizes to multiple rider interactions.

&quot;Pfront&quot; is the power output of the front-rider as she sets the pace within the coupled system;

&quot;d&quot; expresses the follower’s energy savings due to drafting, as a fraction (percentage) of the front-rider’s power output;

&quot;MSOfollow&quot; is the maximal sustainable power output for the follower.

Thus, if Pfront exceeds the follower&#x27;s MSO, the follower will be unable to sustain the speed of the pace-setting front-rider and must decelerate to a speed less than or equal to that speed representative of the limitation of MSO. A drafting cyclist may operate at or below MSO. If the cyclist is at MSO while drafting but conditions change (e.g., the rider falls too far behind or too far to the side of the optimal drafting position, with respect to the leader), then the follower must decelerate. If she is below MSO while drafting but temporarily falls outside drafting range, she can increase power output to maintain the pace of the leader as long as she does not exceed MSO. This algorithm produces a realistic simulation of oscillating phase behavior between compact and stretched pelotons as speeds vary throughout the course of a race. Trenchard et al. tested the model against an actual set of MSOs for 14 cyclists who participated in a velodrome (track) race. The simulation test produced a realistic simulation of the actual race in terms of phase oscillations and cyclist&#x27;s relative positions.

==Protocooperative behavior in pelotons==

Trenchard proposed a theoretical framework for peloton &quot;protocooperative&quot; behavior, a form of cooperation that emerges naturally from physical interactive principles as opposed to ones driven by human competitive, sociological or economic motivations. In this way, protocooperative behavior involves universal principles which Trenchard hypothesizes may be found in many biological systems involving energy saving mechanisms. The parameters of protocooperative behavior include: 1. two or more cyclists coupled by drafting benefit; 2. cyclists&#x27; power output or speed; and 3. cyclists&#x27; maximal sustainable outputs (MSO). The main characteristics of protocooperative behavior are: 1. a comparatively low-speed phase in which cyclists naturally pass each other and share highest-cost front positions; and 2. a free-riding phase (essentially the singe-file phase identified above), in which cyclists can maintain speeds of those ahead, but cannot pass. The threshold between these two phases is equivalent to the coefficient of drafting (d), below which cooperative behavior occurs and above which free-riding (single-file) occurs up to a second threshold when coupled cyclists diverge. Applying the PCR equation (noted above), the range of cyclists’ MSOs in the free-riding phase is equivalent to the energy savings benefit of drafting (1-d). When driven to maximal speeds, pelotons tend to sort into sub-groups such that their MSO ranges equal the free-riding range (1-d).

Trenchard extracts the following principles:

# Weaker cyclists can sustain the pace of the strongest rider between PCR = d and PCR = 1 (d &lt; PCR &lt; 1), as free-riders. In this PCR range, equivalent to the energy savings (1-d), these cyclists cannot pass and share the most costly front position. Stronger cyclists in drafting positions will always be able to pass weaker cyclists ahead.
# As speeds are increased up to maximal speeds set by the strongest riders, cyclists whose MSOs are below the PCR range (1-d), equivalent to the energy saved by drafting, will separate from the peloton (PCR ≥ 1).
# Cyclists can engage in cooperative behavior (passing and sharing most costly front position) in combinations of MSOs at speeds such that PCR ≤ d.
# These principles imply that if cyclists in a peloton exhibit a range of MSOs greater than the energy savings equivalent of drafting (1-d), over time and continual fluctuations in peloton speed, the peloton will divide such that sub-groups fit within the range equivalent of 1-d.

It is this sorting behavior that Trenchard hypothesizes to be a universal evolutionary principle among biological systems coupled by an energy-saving mechanism, which he and collaborators have developed further in relation to extinct trilobites and slime mold

==Strategy==

While the riders at the very front encounter the greatest air resistance (and also those on the windward side when there is a significant crosswind), those behind the first few riders near the front have critical advantages.

Being close to the front means that the rider can see and react to attacks from competitors, and changes in position, with far less effort. Gaps sometimes form in the peloton, and being close to the front reduces the risk of getting caught in the rear group if a break occurs in the peloton, for example, after a crash. Riders near the front are much less likely to have delays due to involvement in crashes.

There is increasing risk of delays or injury from involvement in crashes as one falls farther back in the peloton. In addition, riders are increasingly affected by the accordion effect, in which a change in speed becomes amplified as it propagates to the back of the peloton. The riders following must anticipate and brake early to avoid collisions when the peloton slows. Touching wheels for even a moment normally results in a crash, which spreads across the field in chain reaction as the densely packed riders cannot avoid hitting downed riders and bikes. The entire peloton behind the crash may be stopped.

Being close to the front is also critical in strong crosswind conditions. Cross winds create a significant fatigue penalty for everyone, unless riders form moving groups called echelons in which riders collaborate to form a &#x27;paceline&#x27; in a racetrack pattern angled across the road, with the leading rider on the upwind side of the road. Riders for a paceline, such as an echelon, sequentially change positions at short intervals so that no one rider must long accumulate excessive fatigue from facing maximum wind resistance at the leading edge. Echelons are necessarily limited in size by the roadway&#x27;s width.

When a large peloton is exposed to a significant crosswind on a narrow road, the peloton cannot avoid breaking into a number of small echelons. Teams aware of wind conditions ahead, strong enough to move to the front, well experienced in echelon riding, can gain an important time advantage in these circumstances.

It is critical for riders in contention to win a race to remain near (but not at) the front of the peloton, especially when approaching sharp turns that require braking. Resuming pace after a sharp turn (especially into wind) routinely causes division in a peloton. Once a division occurs, if the will and collective strength of those wisely placed at the front is greater than those behind, the gap between the groups will remain (or increase) to the end of the race, because the extra air resistance for a single rider attempting to move forward to reach the front group imposes an extravagant fatigue penalty, as compared to those who remained protected in the peloton. This is particularly true at high speed on flat roads.

When a team maneuvers to the front of the peloton, it has placed itself in position to dictate the tempo of the race. Teams of riders may prefer a faster or slower tempo depending on the team&#x27;s tactics.

Being near or at the front of the peloton is critical when initiating a breakaway.

A few strong riders will always attempt to break away from the main peloton, attempting to build such a commanding lead early in the race that the peloton cannot catch up before the finish. Breakaways may succeed when break riders are strong, especially if none of the riders in the break is a danger man (in contention for a win in the overall contest), and if they all pull together as a team. The rider (or riders) who are in the lead and have also successfully broken away from the peloton are referred to as Tête de la Course (a French expression meaning “head of the race”). The peloton will not allow a break with a danger man to get far ahead. Strong teams who want to bring their sprinter into contention for the win come to the front of the peloton and dictate a harsh pace, imposing fatigue on rivals, meanwhile breakaway riders (who individually must spend much more time exposed to the wind than peloton members) sequentially succumb to fatigue and are normally caught. Otherwise successful breaks often fall into disarray just before the finish, where rider calculations regarding personal chances for victory destroy the uneasy break alliance, meanwhile the peloton is catching up quickly.

Tactical factors also apply. Team tactics generally involve clustering their members within the peloton in order to maximize their ability to affect the peloton. For example, if a team member is currently in a breakaway group out in front of the main peloton, the remaining team members will normally make no attempt to accelerate the peloton, to maximize the chances of success for their breakaway group rider. Rarely, they may move to the front of the peloton, and actively seek to check the progress of the peloton at a critical moment. This tactic has the best chance of success on narrow roads, with tight turns, where a single team can fill the road from one side to the other.

In races where the finish is on flat roads, within a few kilometers from the finish, strong teams form into lines, with their principal sprint contender at the rear. The leading rider of each contending team drives forward at the highest pace he can achieve, until he reaches the limit of his endurance, when he then pulls off to the side, allowing the succeeding team member in line to drive forward to his limit. The team sprinter slipstreams at the rear to minimize fatigue due to air resistance until the last hundred meters or so, when the sprinter will choose the moment to dash out from behind his lead-out rider to charge to the finish at the highest possible speed.

<text>The minister of energy and natural resources () is the minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet who is responsible for Natural Resources Canada (NRCan).

In addition to NRCan, the minister oversees the federal government&#x27;s natural resources portfolio, which includes Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, the Canada Energy Regulator, and the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, as well as the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore and the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Petroleum Boards. The Energy Supplies Allocation Board and the Northern Pipeline Agency also report to the Minister as required.

The current minister of energy and natural resources is Jonathan Wilkinson, since October 26, 2021. This position was established in 1995 under the &quot;Department of Natural Resources Act&quot;, S.C. 1994, c. 41, which merged the positions of the minister of energy, mines and resources and minister of forestry.

== History ==
Prior to 1995, the responsibilities of the current natural resources portfolio were divided between the minister of energy, mines and resources and the minister of forestry, both posts which are now defunct.

With the transfer of the Canadian Forest Service from the Department of Forestry to the Department of Agriculture, the forestry portfolio came under the minister of agriculture between 1984 and 1985, then back to the minister of the environment from 1985. It became a single department in 1989 and then designated to the minister of energy, mines and resources in 1990.

In 1994, the &quot;Department of Natural Resources Act&quot;, S.C. 1994, c. 41, provided for the creation of the minister of natural resources, with authority to carry out matters previously undertaken by the minister of forestry and the minister of energy, mines and resources.

=== Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources ===
The minister of energy, mines, and resources () was a member of the Cabinet from 1966 to 1995.

Prior to 1966, the responsibility related to Canadian mines and natural resources resided in various ministers:

* Minister of the Interior (1873–1936)
* Minister of Mines (1907–36)
* Minister of Mines and Resources (1936–50)
* Minister of Resources and Development (1950–53)
* Minister of Mines and Technical Surveys (1950–66)
* Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1953–62)

The emerging role of energy development in federal policy would become more prominent in 1966, when that responsibility was adopted by the natural resources portfolio, whereupon the minister of mines and technical surveys was abolished and the minister of energy, mines and resources was established in its place by Statute 14-15 Eliz. II, c. 25—which received royal assent on 16 June 1966 and proclaimed in-force on October 1 later that year.

Three decades later, in 1995, the energy, mines and resources portfolio merged with that of forestry to form the current minister of natural resources, under the &quot;Department of Natural Resources Act&quot;, S.C. 1994, c. 41—which received royal assent on December 15, 1994.

===Minister of Forestry===
The minister of forestry was an office in the Cabinet from 1962 to 1966 and again from 1990 to 1995. Between 1966 and 1990, the holder was known as the minister of forestry and rural development.

Prior to 1962, the responsibility for forestry resided in various ministers:

* Minister of the Interior (1873–1936)
* Minister of Mines and Resources (1936–50)
* Minister of Resources and Development (1950–53)
* Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources (1953–62)

The position of minister of forestry was first created in 1962, late in John Diefenbaker&#x27;s premiership. It lasted into the government of Lester B. Pearson.

In 1971, during the first mandate of Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s government, responsibility for forestry along with fisheries merged into the minister of the environment, briefly renamed as minister of fisheries and the environment from 1976 to 1979, minister of state (environment) from 1977 to 1979, and then minister of the environment again from 1979 to 1984.

In 1989, during the second mandate of Brian Mulroney&#x27;s government, the second incarnation of the Department of Forestry was established under the &quot;Department of Forestry Act&quot; (assented to 21 December 1989). In 1995, during the first mandate of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s government, the forestry portfolio was merged with that of the minister of energy, mines, and resources to create the post of minister of natural resources. During the cabinet shuffle of July 26, 2023, this title was expanded to become the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

<text>Natural Resources Canada (NRCan; ; ) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for natural resources, energy, minerals and metals, forests, earth sciences, mapping, and remote sensing. It was formed in 1994 by amalgamating the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources with the Department of Forestry. 

Under the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;, primary responsibility for natural resources falls to provincial governments, however, the federal government has jurisdiction over off-shore resources, trade and commerce in natural resources, statistics, international relations, and boundaries. The department administers federal legislation relating to natural resources, including energy, forests, minerals and metals. The department also collaborates with American and Mexican government scientists, along with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, to produce the &quot;North American Environmental Atlas&quot;, which is used to depict and track environmental issues for a continental perspective. 

The current minister of natural resources is Jonathan Wilkinson. The department is governed by the &quot;Resources and Technical Surveys Act&quot; and the &quot;Department of Natural Resources Act&quot;.

==Structure==
The department currently has these sectors:

*Corporate Management and Services Sector
*Land and Minerals Sector
*Strategic Policy and Innovation Sector
*Low Carbon Energy Sector
*Energy Efficiency and Technology Sector

<doc id="621350" wikidata="Q1755021" url="?curid=621350" title="Niyama">
<text>Niyamas () are positive duties or observances. In Dharma, particularly Yoga, &quot;niyamas&quot; and their complement, yamas, are recommended activities and habits for healthy living, spiritual enlightenment, and a liberated state of existence. It has multiple meanings depending on context in Hinduism. In Buddhism, the term extends to the determinations of nature, as in the Buddhist &quot;niyama dhammas&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Niyama&quot; (नियम) is derived from the Sanskrit root &quot;niyam&quot; (नियम्) which means &quot;to hold&quot;. Thus, &quot;niyama&quot; translates to &quot;rule&quot;, &quot;observances&quot;, or &quot;practices of self-restraint&quot;.

==Hinduism==
Within the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, &quot;niyamas&quot; are described in the eight limbs (steps; ashtanga yoga) of yoga. &quot;Niyama&quot; is the second limb which includes virtuous habits, behaviors, and observances (the &quot;dos&quot;). These virtues and ethical premises are considered in Hinduism as necessary for an individual to achieve a liberation or moksha.

===Five niyamas ===
In Patanjali&#x27;s Yoga Sutras, the five &quot;niyamas&quot; are listed as:

# Shaucha (शौच): external (the body) and internal (the mind) purity.
# Santosha (सन्तोष): contentment; disinterest in acquiring more than one&#x27;s needs of life.
# Tapas (तपस्): austerity, self-discipline, persistent meditation and perseverance.
# Svādhyāya (स्वाध्याय): study of sacred scriptures for one&#x27;s liberation.
# Īśvarapranidhāna (ईश्वरप्रणिधान): offering all of one&#x27;s activities to Supreme/God (&quot;Īśvara&quot;).

===Ten niyamas===
Some texts suggest a different and expanded list of &quot;niyamas&quot;. For example, the Shandilya and Varaha Upanishads, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, verses 552 to 557 in Book 3 of the Tirumandhiram of Tirumular suggest ten &quot;niyamas.&quot; The Hatha Yoga Pradipika lists the following ten niyamas in verse 1.18:

# Tapas (तपस्): persistence, perseverance in one&#x27;s purpose, austerity
# Santosha (सन्तोष): contentment, acceptance of others and of one&#x27;s circumstances as they are, optimism for self
# Āstikya (आस्तिक्य): faith in Real Self (jnana yoga, raja yoga), belief in God (bhakti yoga), conviction in Vedas/Upanishads (orthodox school)
# Dāna (दान): generosity, charity, sharing with others
# Īśvarapūjana (ईश्वरपूजन): worship of the Ishvara (God/Supreme Being, Brahman, True Self, Unchanging Reality)
# Siddhānta vākya śravaṇa (सिद्धान्त वाक्य श्रवण) or Siddhānta śravaṇa (सिद्धान्त श्रवण): Listening to the ancient scriptures
# Hrī (ह्री): remorse and acceptance of one&#x27;s past, modesty, humility
# Mati (मति): think and reflect to understand, reconcile conflicting ideas
# Japa (जप): mantra repetition, reciting prayers or knowledge
# Huta (हुत) or Vrata (व्रत): 
## Huta (हुत): rituals, ceremonies such as yajna sacrifice.
## Vrata (व्रत): Fulfilling religious vows, rules and observances faithfully.

Some texts replace the last niyama of &quot;Huta&quot; with &quot;Vrata&quot;. The niyama of &quot;Vrata&quot; means making and keeping one&#x27;s vows (resolutions), which may be pious observances. For example, a promise to fast and visit a pilgrimage site is a form of &quot;Vrata&quot;. The education process in ancient India, where Vedas and Upanishads were memorized and transmitted across generations without ever being written down, required a series of &quot;Vrata&quot; niyamas over a number of years.

===Other niyamas===
At least sixty five ancient and medieval era Indian texts are known so far that discuss &quot;niyamas&quot;. Most are in Sanskrit, but some are in regional Indian languages of Hindus. The number of niyamas mentioned in these texts range from just one to eleven, however five and ten are the most common. The order of listed niyamas, the names and nature of each niyama, as well as the relative emphasis vary between the texts. For example, Sriprashna Samhita discusses only one niyama in verse 3.22 - ahimsa. Shivayoga Dipika, Sharada Tilaka, Vasishtha Samhita, Yoga Kalpalatika, Yajnavalkya Smriti, and many others, each discuss 10 &quot;niyamas&quot;. The Bhagavata Purana discusses eleven &quot;niyamas&quot;, with kind hospitality of guests, to one&#x27;s best ability, as an additional virtuous behavior. Other texts substitute one or more different concepts in their list of &quot;niyamas&quot;. For example, in the five &quot;niyamas&quot; listed by Markandeya Purana in verse 36.17, Matanga Parameshvaram in verse 17.31, and Pashupata Sutra in verse 1.9, each suggest akrodha (non-anger) as a &quot;niyama&quot;. 

Ahimsa is the most widely discussed ethical theory and highlighted as the highest virtue by majority of these texts.

==Buddhism==
Buddhist commentary from the 5th to 13th centuries CE contains the &quot;pañcavidha niyama&quot;, the fivefold niyamas, in the following texts:

* In the &quot;Aṭṭhasālinī&quot; (272-274), the commentary attributed to Buddhaghosa on the &quot;Dhammasangaṅi&quot;, the first book of the Theravāda Abhidhamma Piṭaka;
* In the &quot;Sumaṅgala-Vilāsinī&quot; (DA 2.431), Buddhaghosa&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Dīgha Nikāya&quot;;
* In the &quot;Abhidhammāvatāra&quot; (PTS p. 54), a verse summary of &quot;Abhidhamma&quot; by Buddhaghosa&#x27;s contemporary, Buddhadatta.
* &quot;Abhidhammamātika Internal Commentary.&quot; (p. 58) The &quot;Abhidhamma-mātika&quot; is a matrix of abstracts for the Abhidhamma, with lists of pairs and triplets of terms from which the whole of the text can theoretically be reconstructed. The passage on the niyamas is from an internal commentary on the mātika associated with the Dhammasaṅgaṇī (the niyāmas do not appear to be mentioned in the mātrix itself, but only in this appendix.); and was composed in South India by Coḷaraṭṭha Kassapa (12th–13th century).
* &quot;Abhidhammāvatāra-purāṇatīkā&quot; (p. 1.68). Composed in Sri Lanka by Vācissara Mahāsāmi c. 13th century or Sāriputta c. 12th century. This text is an incomplete word-by-word commentary on the text of the Abhidhammāvatāra Nāmarūpa-parichedo (ṭīka).

The five niyamas in this set are:

# &quot;utu-niyāma&quot; &quot;the constraint of the seasons&quot;, i.e. in certain regions of the earth at certain periods the flowering and fruiting of trees all at one time (&quot;ekappahāreneva&quot;), the blowing or ceasing of wind, the degree of the heat of the sun, the amount of rain-fall, some flowers like the lotuses opening during the day and closing at night and so on; 
# &quot;bīja-niyāma&quot; &quot;the constraint of seeds or germs&quot;, i.e. a seed producing its own kind as barley seed produces barley; 
# &quot;kammaniyāma&quot; &quot;the constraint of &quot;kamma&quot;&quot;, i.e. good actions produce good results and bad actions produce bad results. This constraint is said to be epitomised by [Dhammapada] verse 127 which explains that the consequences of actions are inescapable; 
# &quot;citta-niyāma&quot; &quot;the constraint of mind&quot;, i.e. the order of the process of mind-activities as the preceding thought-moment causing and conditioning the succeeding one in a cause and effect relation; 
# &quot;dhamma-niyāma&quot; &quot;the constraint of dhammas&quot;, i.e. such events like the quaking of the ten thousand world-systems at the Bodhisatta&#x27;s conception in his mother&#x27;s womb and at his birth. At the end of the discussion &quot;Sumaṅgalavilāsinī&quot; passage the Commentary says that &quot;dhammaniyāma&quot; explains the term dhammatā in the text of the &quot;Mahāpadāna Sutta&quot; (D ii.12) (Cf. S 12.20 for a discussion of the use of the word &quot;dhammaniyamatā&quot; in the suttas)

In these texts the set of fivefold niyamas was introduced into commentarial discussions not to illustrate that the universe was intrinsically ethical, but as a list that demonstrated the universal scope of &quot;paṭicca-samuppāda&quot;. The original purpose was, according to Ledi Sayadaw, neither to promote or to demote the law of karma, but to show the scope of natural law as an alternative to the claims of theism.

C.A.F. Rhys Davids was the first western scholar to draw attention to the list of &quot;pañcavidha niyama&quot; in her 1912 book, &quot;Buddhism&quot;. Her reason for mentioning it was to emphasise how for Buddhism we exist in a &quot;moral universe&quot; in which actions lead to just consequences according to a natural moral order, a situation she calls a &quot;cosmodicy&quot; in contrast with the Christian theodicy.:

In Rhys Davids&#x27; scheme the niyamas become:

* &quot;kamma niyama&quot;: (&quot;action&quot;) consequences of one&#x27;s actions
* &quot;utu niyama&quot;: (&quot;time, season&quot;) seasonal changes and climate, law of non-living matter
* &quot;bīja niyama&quot;: (&quot;seed&quot;) laws of heredity
* &quot;citta niyama&quot;:(&quot;mind&quot;) will of mind
* &quot;dhamma niyama&quot;: (&quot;law&quot;) nature&#x27;s tendency to perfect

This is similar to the scheme proposed by Ledi Sayadaw. Western Buddhist Sangharakshita has taken up Mrs Rhys Davids conception of the niyamas and made it an important aspect of his own teachings on Buddhism.

===Spelling===

In Pāli the word is spelled both &quot;niyama&quot; and &quot;niyāma&quot;, and the Pali Text Society Dictionary says that the two forms have become confused. It is likely that &quot;niyāma&quot; is from a causative form of the verb &quot;ni√i&quot;.

<text>Parliamentary elections were held in Norway on 14 and 15 September 1997. Prior to the election Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland of the Labour Party had issued the 36.9 ultimatum declaring that the government would step down unless it gained 36.9% of the vote, the percentage gained by the Labour Party in 1993 under Gro Harlem Brundtland. Whilst Labour won a plurality of seats, they were unable to reach Jagland&#x27;s 36.9% threshold, gaining 35% of the vote.

As a result of this, the Labour government stepped down, being replaced by a centrist coalition of the Christian People&#x27;s Party, Liberal Party and the Centre Party, with Kjell Magne Bondevik being appointed Prime Minister, and confidence and supply support from the Conservative Party and the right-wing Progress Party.
