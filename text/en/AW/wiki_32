<text>Pleasure is experience that feels good, that involves the enjoyment of something. It contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling bad. It is closely related to value, desire and action: humans and other conscious animals find pleasure enjoyable, positive or worthy of seeking. A great variety of activities may be experienced as pleasurable, like eating, having sex, listening to music or playing games. Pleasure is part of various other mental states such as ecstasy, euphoria and flow. Happiness and well-being are closely related to pleasure but not identical with it. There is no general agreement as to whether pleasure should be understood as a sensation, a quality of experiences, an attitude to experiences or otherwise. Pleasure plays a central role in the family of philosophical theories known as hedonism.

== Definition ==
&quot;Pleasure&quot; refers to experience that feels good, that involves the enjoyment of something. The term is primarily used in association with &quot;sensory pleasures&quot; like the enjoyment of sex or food. But in its most general sense, it includes all types of positive or pleasant experiences including the enjoyment of sports, seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity. 

Pleasure contrasts with pain or suffering, which are forms of feeling bad. Both pleasure and pain come in degrees and have been thought of as a dimension going from positive degrees through a neutral point to negative degrees. This assumption is important for the possibility of comparing and aggregating the degrees of pleasure of different experiences, for example, in order to perform the Utilitarian calculus.

===Related concepts===
The concept of pleasure is similar but not identical to the concepts of well-being and of happiness. These terms are used in overlapping ways, but their meanings tend to come apart in technical contexts like philosophy or psychology. &quot;Pleasure&quot; refers to a certain type of experience while &quot;well-being&quot; is about what is good for a person. Many philosophers agree that &quot;pleasure&quot; is good for a person and therefore is a form of &quot;well-being&quot;. But there may be other things besides or instead of pleasure that constitute &quot;well-being&quot;, like health, virtue, knowledge or the fulfillment of desires. On some conceptions, &quot;happiness&quot; is identified with &quot;the individual&#x27;s balance of pleasant over unpleasant experience&quot;. &quot;Life satisfaction theories&quot;, on the other hand, hold that &quot;happiness&quot; involves having the &quot;right attitude towards one&#x27;s life as a whole&quot;. &quot;Pleasure&quot; may have a role to play in this attitude, but it is not identical to &quot;happiness&quot;.

Pleasure is closely related to value, desire, motivation and right action. There is broad agreement that pleasure is valuable in some sense.

==Sources and types==
===Sources===
Many pleasurable experiences are associated with satisfying basic biological drives, such as eating, exercise, hygiene, sleep, and sex. Pleasure may come from the enjoyment of food, sex, sports, seeing a beautiful sunset or engaging in an intellectually satisfying activity. The appreciation of cultural artifacts and activities such as art, music, dancing, and literature is often pleasurable. 

===Types===
Pleasure is sometimes subdivided into fundamental pleasures that are closely related to survival (food, sex, and social belonging) and higher-order pleasures (e.g., viewing art and altruism). 

Jeremy Bentham listed 14 kinds of pleasure; sense, wealth, skill, amity, a good name, power, piety, benevolence, malevolence, memory, imagination, expectation, pleasures dependent on association, and the pleasures of relief. 

Some commentators see &#x27;complex pleasures&#x27; including wit and sudden realisation, and some see a wide range of pleasurable feelings.

Nick Bostrom listed 3 types of pleasure;
* pleasant or voluptuous bodily sensations.
* thrills from high-energy socialising, consumerism, and indulgence.
* positive hedonic tone, meaning an unmediated liking of the ways things present in the moment.

== Theories of pleasure ==
&quot;Theories of pleasure&quot; try to determine what pleasurable experiences have in common, what is essential to them. They are traditionally divided into 
* quality theories; that pleasure is a quality of pleasurable experiences themselves,
* attitude theories; that pleasure is in some sense external to the experience since it depends on the subject&#x27;s attitude to the experience. An alternative terminology refers to these theories as &quot;phenomenalism&quot; and &quot;intentionalism&quot;. 
* hybrid or dispositional theories, that incorporate elements of both quality and attitude approaches.

=== Quality theories ===
In everyday language, the term &quot;pleasure&quot; is primarily associated with sensory pleasures like the enjoyment of food or sex. One traditionally important &quot;quality-theory&quot; closely follows this association by holding that pleasure is a sensation. On the simplest version of the sensation theory, whenever we experience pleasure there is a distinctive pleasure-sensation present. So a pleasurable experience of eating chocolate involves a sensation of the taste of chocolate together with a pleasure-sensation. An obvious shortcoming of this theory is that many impressions may be present at the same time. For example, there may be an itching sensation as well while eating the chocolate. But this account cannot explain why the enjoyment is linked to the taste of the chocolate and not to the itch. Another problem is due to the fact that sensations are usually thought of as localized somewhere in the body. But considering the pleasure of seeing a beautiful sunset, there seems to be no specific region in the body at which we experience this pleasure.

These problems can be avoided by felt-quality-theories, which see pleasure not as a sensation but as an aspect qualifying sensations or other mental phenomena. As an aspect, pleasure is dependent on the mental phenomenon it qualifies, it cannot be present on its own. Since the link to the enjoyed phenomenon is already built into the pleasure, it solves the problem faced by sensation theories to explain how this link comes about. It also captures the intuition that pleasure is usually pleasure &quot;of&quot; something: enjoyment &quot;of&quot; drinking a milkshake or &quot;of&quot; playing chess but not just pure or object-less enjoyment. According to this approach, pleasurable experiences differ in content (drinking a milkshake, playing chess) but agree in feeling or hedonic tone. Pleasure can be localized, but only to the extent that the impression it qualifies is localized.

One objection to both the sensation theory and the felt-quality theory is that there is no one quality shared by all pleasure-experiences. The force of this objection comes from the intuition that the variety of pleasure-experiences is just too wide to point out one quality shared by all, for example, the quality shared by &quot;enjoying a milkshake&quot; and &quot;enjoying a chess game&quot;. One way for quality theorists to respond to this objection is by pointing out that the hedonic tone of pleasure-experiences is not a regular quality but a higher-order quality. As an analogy, a vividly green thing and a vividly red thing do not share a regular color property but they share &quot;vividness&quot; as a higher-order property.

=== Attitude theories ===
&quot;Attitude theories&quot; propose to analyze pleasure in terms of attitudes to experiences. So to enjoy the taste of chocolate it is not sufficient to have the corresponding experience of the taste. Instead, the subject has to have the right attitude to this taste for pleasure to arise. This approach captures the intuition that a second person may have exactly the same taste-experience but not enjoy it since the relevant attitude is lacking. Various attitudes have been proposed for the type of attitude responsible for pleasure, but historically the most influential version assigns this role to desires. On this account, pleasure is linked to experiences that fulfill a desire had by the experiencer. So the difference between the first and the second person in the example above is that only the first person has a corresponding desire directed at the taste of chocolate.

One important argument against this version is that while it is often the case that we desire something first and then enjoy it, this cannot always be the case. In fact, often the opposite seems to be true: we have to learn first that something is enjoyable before we start to desire it. This objection can be partially avoided by holding that it does not matter whether the desire was there before the experience but that it only matters what we desire while the experience is happening. This variant, originally held by Henry Sidgwick, has recently been defended by Chris Heathwood, who holds that an experience is pleasurable if the subject of the experience wants the experience to occur for its own sake while it is occurring. But this version faces a related problem akin to the Euthyphro dilemma: it seems that we usually desire things because they are enjoyable, not the other way round. So desire theories would be mistaken about the direction of explanation. Another argument against desire theories is that desire and pleasure can come apart: we can have a desire for things that are not enjoyable and we can enjoy things without desiring to do so.

=== Dispositional theories ===
&quot;Dispositional theories&quot; try to account for pleasure in terms of dispositions, often by including insights from both the quality theories and the attitude theories. One way to combine these elements is to hold that pleasure consists in being disposed to desire an experience in virtue of the qualities of this experience. Some of the problems of the regular desire theory can be avoided this way since the disposition does not need to be realized for there to be pleasure, thereby taking into account that desire and pleasure can come apart.

==Roles in philosophy==
===Hedonism===
&quot;Pleasure&quot; plays a central role in theories from various areas of &quot;philosophy&quot;. Such theories are usually grouped together under the label &quot;hedonism&quot;. Axiological hedonists hold that pleasure is the only thing that has intrinsic value. Many desires are concerned with pleasure. Psychological hedonism is the thesis that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain. Freud&#x27;s pleasure principle ties pleasure to motivation and action by holding that there is a strong psychological tendency to seek pleasure and to avoid pain. Classical utilitarianism connects pleasure to ethics in stating that whether an action is right depends on the pleasure it produces: it should maximize the sum-total of pleasure.

=== Ethics ===
Pleasure is related not just to how we actually act, but also to how we ought to act, which belongs to the field of &quot;ethics&quot;. Ethical hedonism takes the strongest position on this relation in stating that considerations of increasing pleasure and decreasing pain fully determine what we should do or which action is right. &quot;Ethical hedonist theories&quot; can be classified in relation to whose pleasure should be increased. According to the egoist version, each agent should only aim at maximizing her own pleasure. This position is usually not held in very high esteem. Utilitarianism, on the other hand, is a family of altruist theories that are more respectable in the philosophical community. Within this family, classical utilitarianism draws the closest connection between pleasure and right action by holding that the agent should maximize the sum-total of everyone&#x27;s happiness. This sum-total includes the agent&#x27;s pleasure as well, but only as one factor among many.

=== Value ===
Pleasure is intimately connected to &quot;value&quot; as something that is desirable and worth seeking. According to axiological hedonism, it is the only thing that has intrinsic value or is &quot;good in itself&quot;. This position entails that things other than pleasure, like knowledge, virtue or money, only have &quot;instrumental value&quot;: they are valuable because or to the extent that they produce pleasure but lack value otherwise. Within the scope of axiological hedonism, there are two competing theories about the exact relation between pleasure and value: &quot;quantitative hedonism&quot; and &quot;qualitative hedonism&quot;. Quantitative hedonists, following Jeremy Bentham, hold that the specific content or quality of a pleasure-experience is not relevant to its value, which only depends on its quantitative features: intensity and duration. On this account, an experience of intense pleasure of indulging in food and sex is worth more than an experience of subtle pleasure of looking at fine art or of engaging in a stimulating intellectual conversation. Qualitative hedonists, following John Stuart Mill, object to this version on the grounds that it threatens to turn axiological hedonism into a &quot;philosophy of swine&quot;. Instead, they argue that the quality is another factor relevant to the value of a pleasure-experience, for example, that the &quot;lower pleasures&quot; of the body are less valuable than the &quot;higher pleasures&quot; of the mind.

=== Beauty ===
A very common element in many conceptions of beauty is its relation to pleasure. Aesthetic hedonism makes this relation part of the definition of beauty by holding that there is a necessary connection between pleasure and beauty, e.g. that for an object to be beautiful is for it to cause pleasure or that the experience of beauty is always accompanied by pleasure. The pleasure due to beauty does not need to be &quot;pure&quot;, i.e. exclude all unpleasant elements. Instead, beauty can involve &quot;mixed&quot; pleasure, for example, in the case of a beautifully tragic story. We take pleasure from many things that are not beautiful, which is why beauty is usually defined in terms of a special type of pleasure: &quot;aesthetic&quot; or &quot;disinterested&quot; pleasure. A pleasure is disinterested if it is indifferent to the existence of the beautiful object. For example, the joy of looking at a beautiful landscape would still be valuable if it turned out that this experience was an illusion, which would not be true if this joy was due to seeing the landscape as a valuable real estate opportunity. Opponents of &quot;aesthetic hedonism&quot; have pointed out that despite commonly occurring together, there are cases of beauty without pleasure. For example, a cold jaded critic may still be a good judge of beauty due to her years of experience but lack the joy that initially accompanied her work. A further question for hedonists is how to explain the relation between beauty and pleasure. This problem is akin to the Euthyphro dilemma: is something beautiful because we enjoy it or do we enjoy it because it is beautiful? Identity theorists solve this problem by denying that there is a difference between beauty and pleasure: they identify beauty, or the appearance of it, with the experience of aesthetic pleasure.

==History of analysis of pleasure==
=== Hellenistic philosophy ===
The ancient Cyrenaics posited pleasure as the universal aim for all people. Later, Epicurus defined the highest pleasure as aponia (the absence of pain), and pleasure as &quot;freedom from pain in the body and freedom from turmoil in the soul&quot;. According to Cicero (or rather his character Torquatus) Epicurus also believed that pleasure was the chief good and pain the chief evil. The Pyrrhonist philosopher Aenesidemus claimed that following Pyrrhonism&#x27;s prescriptions for philosophical skepticism produced pleasure.

=== Medieval philosophy ===
In the 12th century, Razi&#x27;s &quot;Treatise of the Self and the Spirit&quot; (&quot;Kitab al Nafs Wa’l Ruh&quot;) analyzed different types of pleasure- sensuous and intellectual, and explained their relations with one another. He concludes that human needs and desires are endless, and &quot;their satisfaction is by definition impossible.&quot;

=== Schopenhauer ===
The 19th-century German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer understood pleasure as a negative sensation, one that negates the usual existential condition of suffering.

== Psychology ==
Pleasure is often regarded as a bipolar construct, meaning that the two ends of the spectrum from pleasure to suffering are mutually exclusive. That is part of the circumplex model of affect. Yet, some lines of research suggest that people do experience pleasure and suffering at the same time, giving rise to so-called mixed feelings. Pleasure is considered one of the core dimensions of emotion. It can be described as the positive evaluation that forms the basis for several more elaborate evaluations such as &quot;agreeable&quot; or &quot;nice&quot;. As such, pleasure is an affect and not an emotion, as it forms one component of several different emotions. The clinical condition of being unable to experience pleasure from usually enjoyable activities is called anhedonia. An active aversion to obtaining pleasure is called hedonophobia.

===Pleasure and belief===
The degree to which something or someone is experienced as pleasurable not only depends on its objective attributes (appearance, sound, taste, texture, etc.), but on beliefs about its history, about the circumstances of its creation, about its rarity, fame, or price, and on other non-intrinsic attributes, such as the social status or identity it conveys. For example, a sweater that has been worn by a celebrity is more desired than an otherwise identical sweater that has not, though considerably less so if it has been washed.

=== Motivation and behavior ===
Pleasure-seeking &quot;behavior&quot; is a common phenomenon and may indeed dominate our conduct at times. The thesis of psychological hedonism generalizes this insight by holding that all our actions aim at increasing pleasure and avoiding pain. This is usually understood in combination with egoism, i.e. that each person only aims at her own happiness. Our actions rely on beliefs about what causes pleasure. False beliefs may mislead us and thus our actions may fail to result in pleasure, but even failed actions are &quot;motivated&quot; by considerations of pleasure, according to &quot;psychological hedonism&quot;. The paradox of hedonism states that pleasure-seeking behavior commonly fails also in another way. It asserts that being motivated by pleasure is self-defeating in the sense that it leads to less actual pleasure than following other motives.

Sigmund Freud formulated his pleasure principle in order to account for the effect pleasure has on our behavior. It states that there is a strong, inborn tendency of our mental life to seek immediate gratification whenever an opportunity presents itself. This tendency is opposed by the reality principle, which constitutes a learned capacity to delay immediate gratification in order to take the real consequences of our actions into account. Freud also described the &quot;pleasure principle&quot; as a positive feedback mechanism that motivates the organism to recreate the situation it has just found pleasurable, and to avoid past situations that caused pain.

=== Cognitive biases ===
A &quot;cognitive bias&quot; is a systematic tendency of thinking and judging in a way that deviates from a normative criterion, especially from the demands of rationality. Cognitive biases in regard to &quot;pleasure&quot; include the &quot;peak–end rule&quot;, the &quot;focusing illusion&quot;, the &quot;nearness bias&quot; and the &quot;future bias&quot;.

The &quot;peak–end rule&quot; affects how we remember the pleasantness or unpleasantness of experiences. It states that our overall impression of past events is determined for the most part not by the total pleasure and suffering it contained but by how it felt at its &quot;peaks&quot; and at its &quot;end&quot;. For example, the memory of a painful colonoscopy is improved if the examination is extended by three minutes in which the scope is still inside but not moved anymore, resulting in a moderately uncomfortable sensation. This extended colonoscopy, despite involving more pain overall, is remembered less negatively due to the reduced pain at the end. This even increases the likelihood for the patient to return for subsequent procedures. Daniel Kahneman explains this distortion in terms of the difference between two selves: the &quot;experiencing self&quot;, which is aware of pleasure and pain as they are happening, and the &quot;remembering self&quot;, which shows the aggregate pleasure and pain over an extended period of time. The distortions due to the &quot;peak–end rule&quot; happen on the level of the &quot;remembering self&quot;. Our tendency to rely on the &quot;remembering self&quot; can often lead us to pursue courses of action that are not in our best self-interest.

A closely related bias is the &quot;focusing illusion&quot;. The &quot;illusion&quot; occurs when people consider the impact of one specific factor on their overall happiness. They tend to greatly exaggerate the importance of that factor, while overlooking the numerous other factors that would in most cases have a greater impact.

The &quot;nearness bias&quot; and the &quot;future bias&quot; are two different forms of violating the principle of &quot;temporal neutrality&quot;. This principle states that the temporal location of a benefit or a harm is not important for its normative significance: a rational agent should care to the same extent about all parts of their life. The &quot;nearness bias&quot;, also discussed under the labels &quot;present bias&quot; or &quot;temporal discounting&quot;, refers to our tendency to violate &quot;temporal neutrality&quot; in regards to temporal distance from the present. On the positive side, we prefer pleasurable experiences to be near rather than distant. On the negative side, we prefer painful experiences to be distant rather than near. The &quot;future bias&quot; refers to our tendency to violate &quot;temporal neutrality&quot; in regards to the direction of time. On the positive side, we prefer pleasurable experiences to be in the future rather than in the past. On the negative side, we prefer painful experiences to be in the past rather than in the future.

==Reward system==
===Pleasure centers===
===Motivation===
While all pleasurable stimuli can be seen as rewards, some rewards do not evoke pleasure. Based upon the incentive salience model of reward – the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces approach behavior and consummatory behavior – an intrinsic reward has two components: a &quot;wanting&quot; or desire component that is reflected in approach behavior, and a &quot;liking&quot; or pleasure component that is reflected in consummatory behavior. Some research indicates that similar mesocorticolimbic circuitry is activated by quite diverse pleasures, suggesting a common neural currency. Some commentators opine that our current understanding of how pleasure happens within us remains poor, but that scientific advance gives optimism for future progress.

==Animal pleasure==

In the past, there has been debate as to whether pleasure is experienced by other animals rather than being an exclusive property of humankind; however, it is now known that animals do experience pleasure, as measured by objective behavioral and neural hedonic responses to pleasurable stimuli.

<text>Cornell Iral Haynes Jr. (born November 2, 1974), better known by his stage name Nelly, is an American rapper, singer, and actor. He grew up in St. Louis, Missouri, and embarked on his musical career in 1993 as a member of the Midwest hip hop group St. Lunatics. He signed with Universal Records as a solo act in 1999 to release his debut studio album, &quot;Country Grammar&quot; (2000). Its lead single &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot; and follow-up, &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;, (featuring City Spud), both entered the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album peaked atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His second album, &quot;Nellyville&quot; (2002), spawned two consecutive &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number-one singles: &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; and &quot;Dilemma&quot; (featuring Kelly Rowland), along with the top-five single, &quot;Air Force Ones&quot; (featuring Murphy Lee and St. Lunatics).

The same-day dual release of his next albums &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;Suit&quot; (2004)—bundled into the 2005 compilation album &quot;Sweatsuit&quot; —were met with continued success. &quot;Sweat&quot; debuted at number two while &quot;Suit&quot; debuted at number one, selling an estimated 700,000 combined units in their first week. His fifth studio album, &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot; (2008), was supported by the singles &quot;Party People&quot; (featuring Fergie), &quot;Stepped on My J&#x27;z&quot; (featuring Jermaine Dupri and Ciara), and &quot;Body on Me&quot; (featuring Akon and Ashanti). His sixth album, &quot;5.0&quot; (2010), delved further into pop. Its lead single, &quot;Just a Dream&quot;, received triple platinum certification by the RIAA and was followed by &quot;Move That Body&quot;, (featuring T-Pain and Akon), and &quot;Gone&quot;, (featuring Kelly Rowland). His seventh and eighth albums, &quot;M.O.&quot; (2013) and &quot;Heartland&quot; (2021), were both met with lukewarm commercial response and mixed reviews; the latter was released by Columbia Records and marked a full departure from his previous styles in favor of country rap.

Nelly has won multiple accolades throughout his career, including three Grammy Awards and nine &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards. He has been referred to by Peter Shapiro as &quot;one of the biggest stars of the new millennium&quot;. In 2014, Nelly was ranked as the fourth-best-selling hip hop artist in American music history according to the RIAA, with 21 million albums sold in the United States. In December 2009, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked Nelly at number three on the Top Artists of the Decade list for the 2000s. Outside of recording, he starred in the 2005 sports film, &quot;The Longest Yard&quot; alongside Adam Sandler and Chris Rock. He launched the clothing line Vokal in 1997 and the line of womenswear, Apple Bottoms in 2003. His record label imprint, Derrty Entertainment, was launched in a joint venture with Motown in 2003; however, it has been largely inactive.

== Life and career ==

=== 1974–2000: Early life and start of career ===
Cornell Iral Haynes Jr. was born on November 2, 1974, in Austin, Texas, the only son of Cornell Haynes and Rhonda Mack. His father served in the Air Force for much of his childhood and when he was seven, his parents divorced. As a teenager, Haynes moved with his mother from St. Louis, Missouri, to University City, a St. Louis County suburb. While in high school, Nelly formed the St. Lunatics with his friends Ali, Murphy Lee, Kyjuan, Slo Down, and his half brother City Spud. The group enjoyed moderate local popularity with their single &quot;Gimme What Ya Got&quot; in 1996.

Despite being popular in Missouri and the surrounding areas, the group struggled to achieve success outside of St. Louis. The rest of the group agreed to let Nelly go solo after a major record deal failed to appear. Later in 1999, Nelly was signed to Universal Music Group by A&amp;R Kevin Law. Law told HitQuarters that Nelly was largely disliked by the label when he first signed, with the feedback he received from his colleagues on the rapper&#x27;s music being &quot;extraordinarily negative&quot;.

Nelly was unusual for being a rapper from the Midwest at a time when hip-hop was dominated by the East Coast, West Coast and the South. The label used this to their advantage by branding him as a star of the Midwest, hoping to inspire pride in the people of St Louis and the surrounding regions. Despite the negative feedback he received from the label, his debut single, &quot;Country Grammar (Hot Shit)&quot;, was a success, peaking at number 7 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and UK singles chart. Recognizing Nelly&#x27;s potential, the label began to change their mind and allowed work to begin on his debut album. The label decided to do a solo record with him first and then reunite him with the St. Lunatics the following year.

=== 2000–2003: Breakthrough with &quot;Country Grammar&quot; and &quot;Nellyville&quot; ===
The label released his debut album, &quot;Country Grammar&quot;, in 2000. The success of its title track as a single, reaching number 7 on the Hot 100 and No. 1 Hot Rap Tracks, led to the album debuting at number three in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S. Other singles from the album included &quot;E.I.&quot;; &quot;Ride wit Me&quot;, featuring City Spud; and &quot;Batter Up&quot;, featuring the St. Lunatics. The album was certified 9× platinum by the RIAA in April 2004. In January 2001, Nelly performed as a special guest in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show.

In 2002, Nelly&#x27;s second album, &quot;Nellyville&quot;, was released, debuting at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Top 200 Music Albums. Its lead single &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; was a number-one hit. Other singles included &quot;Dilemma&quot;, which featured Kelly Rowland and sold over 7.6 million records worldwide, &quot;Work It&quot; featuring Justin Timberlake, &quot;Air Force Ones&quot; featuring Murphy Lee and the St. Lunatics, &quot;Pimp Juice&quot;, and &quot;#1&quot;. This album was highly successful and was certified 6x multi-platinum in June 2003. &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Male Rap Solo Performance in 2003.

In 2003, Nelly released &quot;Da Derrty Versions: The Reinvention&quot;, which featured the hit single &quot;Iz U&quot; from the soundtrack to Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot;. The music video of a Tip Drill Remix became a source of controversy due to perceptions of misogynistic depictions of women. The controversy forced him to cancel an appearance at a bone marrow drive at Spelman College, a historically black college in Atlanta. Similar claims of misogyny surrounded his single &quot;Pimp Juice&quot;. RIAA has certified the album as Platinum. For the &quot;Bad Boys II&quot; soundtrack album, Nelly contributed the single &quot;Shake Ya Tailfeather&quot; featuring Diddy and Murphy Lee. Another number-one hit, &quot;Shake Ya Tailfeather&quot;, won the 2004 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group.

=== 2004–2008: Continued success; &quot;Sweat&quot;, &quot;Suit&quot;, and &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot; ===
In February 2004, Nelly performed in the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, his second time performing in a Super Bowl halftime show.

On September 14, 2004, he released two albums, &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;Suit&quot;. &quot;Suit&quot;, an R&amp;B-oriented album, debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart, and &quot;Sweat&quot;, a rap-oriented album, debuted at number two. From &quot;Suit&quot;, the slow ballad &quot;Over and Over&quot;, an unlikely duet with country music star Tim McGraw, became a crossover hit. On the 2004 NBC television concert special &quot;Tim McGraw: Here and Now&quot;, McGraw and Nelly performed the song. A feud with another St. Louis-based rapper, Chingy, emerged at the end of 2004. &quot;Tsunami Aid: A Concert for Hope&quot;, a 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake benefit concert special produced by NBC, featured Nelly. In the winter of 2005 came &quot;Sweatsuit&quot;, a compilation of tracks from &quot;Sweat&quot; and &quot;Suit&quot; with three new tracks. &quot;Grillz&quot;, produced by Jermaine Dupri, was a number-one hit. To date both albums have sold over 5 million units in the United States.

&quot;Brass Knuckles&quot; was released on September 16, 2008, after several delays. Initial release dates for the album were October 16 and November 13. Its original lead single was &quot;Wadsyaname&quot;, a ballad-oriented track produced by Ron &quot;NEFF-U&quot; Feemstar and sampling the piano riff from &quot;All My Life&quot; by K-Ci &amp; JoJo. Nelly later confirmed that &quot;Wadsyaname&quot; was never going to be on &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot;. He recorded &quot;Party People&quot;, featuring Fergie and produced by Polow da Don, which turned out to be his first official single off the album. &quot;Stepped on My J&#x27;z&quot; was the next single, produced by Jermaine Dupri; it features Dupri and Ciara. Next was &quot;Body on Me&quot;, produced by Akon which features Akon and Ashanti. Nelly appeared on Rick Ross&#x27;s third single, &quot;Here I Am&quot; featuring label mate Avery Storm.

=== 2009–2010: Collaborations and &quot;5.0&quot; ===

In the summer of 2009, Nelly made a public announcement in Las Vegas about the yet-to-be-titled album. In October 2009, in an interview with SOHH.com he said that the album was going to be released sometime in 2010. In an interview with Semtex TV, he told reporters that he planned to release the album under the name &quot;Nelly&quot;. In April 2010, Nelly&#x27;s cousin Michael Johnson was murdered in Missouri. Nelly said that he delayed releasing the album because of the tragedy. Guests featured on the album were T-Pain, Chris Brown, Akon, Plies, T.I., Kelly Rowland, Birdman, DJ Khaled, Avery Storm, and Diddy-Dirty Money.

In May 2010, Nelly confirmed that the title of the album was &quot;5.0&quot;. The album was released on November 16, 2010. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Just a Dream&quot; was released on August 17, 2010, through iTunes along with the promotional single &quot;Tippin&#x27; in da Club&quot;. The two songs were released to mainstream and Rhythm/Crossover radio on August 10, 2010. &quot;Just a Dream&quot; made its first chart appearance debuting on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 12 and peaking at number 3 in its fourth week. The song debuted at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Digital Songs chart, selling 888,000 downloads in its first week.

&quot;Just a Dream&quot; is Nelly&#x27;s highest-charting song since his 2005 single &quot;Grillz&quot; and debuted at number 7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rap Songs. The song entered the Canadian Hot 100 in August 2010, at number 32 It debuted in Australia (ARIA Charts) on the Singles Chart at number 3, in New Zealand Singles Charts at number 29, and in Switzerland (Media Control AG) at number 52. The second single &quot;Move That Body&quot;, which features T-Pain and Akon, was released on October 12, 2010. The song made its first chart appearance debuting on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 54 and reached number 29 in Australia.

In October 2010, Nelly featured on the second single by singer Mohombi entitled &quot;Miss Me&quot;, produced by RedOne. In November 2010, Nelly appeared on the Pacquiao vs. Margarito pay-per-view, at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. &quot;Gone&quot; is the sequel to his 2002 worldwide number-one single &quot;Dilemma&quot;, also with Rowland, and is the third single from the album.

=== 2011–2014: &quot;M.O.&quot; and &quot;The Next: Fame Is at Your Doorstep&quot; ===
In June 2011, Pitbull released a song off the deluxe version of the album &quot;Planet Pit&quot; featuring Nelly titled &quot;My Kinda Girl&quot;. In December 2011, he released his first solo mixtape, entitled &quot;O.E.MO&quot;, which stands for &quot;On Everything MO&quot;.

== Artistry ==

Nelly&#x27;s rapping style has been described by Peter Shapiro as using &quot;unforgettable hooks based on schoolyard songs, double-dutch chants, and nonsense rhymes&quot; and has a &quot;Missouri twang&quot;. AllMusic suggests Nelly&#x27;s style is based largely on where he comes from: &quot;Nelly&#x27;s locale certainly informs his rapping style, which is as much country as urban, and his dialect as well, which is as much Southern drawl as Midwestern twang&quot;.

Nelly explains his method of writing in the book &quot;How to Rap&quot;, describing how he freestyles most of the lyrics before going back over them to &quot;make it a little tighter&quot;, he generally writes in the studio rather than at home, he normally comes up with a chorus for a song before writing the verses, and he likes to write to the music he will be rapping over. AllMusic notes his &quot;tongue-twisting&quot; hooks, which are often sung rather than rapped.

== Personal life ==
Nelly dated singer Ashanti from 2003 to 2013 after meeting at the 2003 Grammy Awards. The two began dating again in 2023. In December 2023, it was reported the couple were expecting their first child together and had married on the 27th. In April 2024, Ashanti confirmed her pregnancy and the couple&#x27;s engagement in &quot;Essence&quot; magazine. On July 18, 2024, the couple welcomed their first child.

Nelly has two children from previous relationships: a son named Cornell Haynes III (Tre) and a daughter named Chanelle (Nana). Nelly also has two adopted children from his stepsister Jaqueline Donahue, who died of leukemia on March 25, 2005. Nelly has been a longtime fan of the St. Louis Cardinals of Major League Baseball. Likewise a fan of the former St. Louis Rams during their tenure in St. Louis from 1995 to 2015, he expressed ongoing support for the team following their relocation to Los Angeles in 2016, even attending their appearance at Super Bowl LVI in 2022.

== Other ventures ==
Nike and Nelly agreed on a one-year deal in 2003 to release a limited-edition sneaker called the &quot;Air Derrty&quot;, which was a retro remake of Charles Barkley&#x27;s signature sneaker. In 2005, Nelly signed a shoe deal with Reebok. He has been in ads for Got Milk? and the Ford Motor Company. His energy drink Pimp Juice sold one million cans during the first two months after its introduction in August 2003, and was criticized for its name by black consumer activists. He owns Apple Bottoms, a female clothing line, and Vokal, which caters to men. He was one of the owners of the Charlotte Bobcats, along with Robert L. Johnson and Michael Jordan, until Jordan became the majority owner in March 2010.

Nelly has played the Main Event at the 2007 World Series of Poker. He has played The PokerStars European Poker Tour and PokerStars Caribbean Adventure. In August 2010, he began a stint as the afternoon host on WHHL HOT 104.1 in St. Louis. He was taking the place of regular PM drive personality, Stacy Static, who left on pregnancy leave.

In September 2010, Nelly released a fitness DVD entitled &quot;Celebrity Sweat&quot;, walking viewers through various exercises and weight training techniques. In 2011, he and Vatterott College worked together to found the Ex&#x27;treme Institute By Nelly, which is a music production school in the heart of St. Louis.

In 2015, Nelly teamed up with Mike and Ike candy after a halt in collaborating a year earlier. He and the owners of Mike and Ike released a movie trailer the same day titled &quot;The Return of Mike and Ike&quot; describing the split and reunion. In 2021, he collaborated with Burger King on the &quot;Cornell Haynes, Jr. Meal&quot;, part of a line of celebrity-themed meals that the establishment created to promote its &quot;Keep It Real Meals&quot;, in recognition of their removal of 120 artificial ingredients from its menu items. The meal consisted of a Whopper, small fries, and a small Sprite.

In April 2023, Nelly launched a moonshine brand called &quot;MoShine&quot;.

=== Feud with Chingy ===
Fellow St. Louis rapper Chingy was hired as an opening act, while touring in support of Nellyville in 2002. Chingy had initially expressed discontent with the lack of promotion on the tour. Meanwhile, reports persisted that Nelly was increasingly irritated with Chingy&#x27;s growth in fame, particularly when he signed with Ludacris&#x27; DTP label shortly following the tour. Nelly claimed he felt disrespected by Chingy&#x27;s actions, claiming in a 2005 interview; &quot;&quot;For him to say that &#x27;Nelly and all them didn&#x27;t take no part in him getting a deal&#x27;, is like saying &#x27;RUN DMC and them didn&#x27;t take any part on me getting a deal&#x27;, everybody that comes out tries to help the next motherfucker&quot;.&quot;

Nelly dropped a verse on the song &#x27;Anotha one&#x27; on his 2004 album Sweat with a line in the song saying, &quot;″I like it how you do it right thurr [there]/You just to remember why you do that right thurr, I made it tight to be country/ They thought country was bummy/ Till country start making money″&quot; which was perceived by Chingy as a diss track. In an interview with Nelly in December 2004, he stated that he believed the lyrics were taken out of context, later claiming: &quot;&quot;I wasn&#x27;t going at him. If you listen to the song, it says, &#x27;I like the way you do that right thurr.&#x27; I could have said, &#x27;Fuck the way you do that right thurr!&#x27; It ain&#x27;t even like that&quot;.

Angered by the song, Chingy leaked a song in response taking aim at Nelly entitled &#x27;We Got&#x27; on January 7, 2005. In December 2005 at the Radio Music Awards in Las Vegas, Chingy alleges he approached Nelly to end the feud, but claims he refused to discuss in private but was ignored repeatedly.

Months later, Chingy approached Nelly&#x27;s cousin, who allowed both rappers to put an end to the feud in 2006. During an interview in November 2022, Chingy alleged Nelly&#x27;s sister Jackie had also approached him at an airport, diligent for both to resolve the feud prior to her death due to cancer complications in March 2005, claiming &quot;At that point, she said she had a wish, and that wish was for me and him to come together... When I heard that, I had to end this; for her. This can&#x27;t go on. She had a wish for this to happen, she really wanted me and her brother to be cool.&quot; 

== Philanthropy ==
Nelly runs the non-profit organization 4Sho4Kids Foundation. In March 2003, he and Jackie Donahue, his sister, began the Jes Us 4 Jackie campaign, after Donahue was diagnosed with leukemia. The campaign attempts to educate African Americans and other minorities about the need for bone marrow transplants. It also tries to register more donors. Donahue died of leukemia on March 24, 2005, almost two years after the campaign began.

In 2006, Nelly started hosting a &quot;White and Black Ball&quot; in his hometown of St. Louis as a fundraiser to collect funds for scholarships. He has sent two students to college every year for over a decade, and set up a scholarship fund named after Michael Brown was shot and killed.

In 2010, Nelly endorsed Do Something&#x27;s Tackle Hunger campaign. In a public service announcement he filmed for the cause, he challenged teens to fight hunger by collecting one million pounds of food for the holiday season.

== Legal issues ==
=== Misdemeanor drug-offense conviction (2015) ===
In April 2015, the Tennessee Highway Patrol conducted a traffic stop of Nelly&#x27;s Prevost tour bus, because of non-conforming U.S. Department of Transportation and International Fuel Tax Association stickers. He, a bus driver, and four other people were on board. After a state trooper said that he smelled marijuana, the troopers searched the bus and said that they found drug paraphernalia and marijuana, as well as a substance that they initially believed to be methamphetamine and several handguns. He was initially booked into the Putnam County Jail and was released on bail.

Nelly was initially charged with felony drug possession, simple possession of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. After further testing proved that the seized substance was not methamphetamine, the felony charge was dropped. In December 2015, the case was resolved when he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of marijuana and misdemeanor possession of drug paraphernalia, and was sentenced to one year probation. Nelly entered a diversion program, in which the misdemeanor convictions were cleared from his record after 11 months.

=== Tax lien (2016) ===
In 2016, it was reported that there was a $2.4 million tax lien against Nelly due to unpaid taxes owed to the IRS.

=== Rape arrest (2017) ===
On October 7, 2017, Nelly was arrested in Auburn, Washington, a southern Seattle suburb, on suspicion of second-degree rape after a woman alleged that he invited her onto his tour bus earlier that morning and raped her. Nelly was booked into a Des Moines, Washington, jail and released from custody without charge. He denied wrongdoing; his attorney said that the accusation was &quot;clearly false&quot;. On December 14, it was revealed Nelly would not be charged in the case because the alleged victim declined to cooperate. He also filed a countersuit claiming defamation. Both lawsuits were dropped after the parties reached a settlement in 2018.

At the end of January 2018, Nelly was again accused of sexual assault after a gig at the Cliffs Pavilion in Westcliff-on-Sea, England, at the end of 2017. There was an additional allegation of assault reported at the time. In 2019, it was reported that he had reached a settlement with the woman who was at Cliffs Pavilion.

=== Drug and insurance arrest (2024) ===
On August 7, 2024, Nelly was arrested in St. Louis, Missouri on a failure-to-appear warrant. The warrant stemmed from an earlier traffic charge in Maryland Heights, Missouri. He was charged with possessing four ecstacy pills and lacking insurance. He was held and then released. His attorney said that Nelly was &quot;targeted by an overzealous, out of line officer&quot;, and that his legal representation would ask for an inquiry into the arresting officer&#x27;s conduct. It was acknowledged that this arrest was originally tied to an arrest warrant, which had been issued by a Judge in December 2023 for a no proof of insurance charge.

The arrest was made after the December 2023 arrest warrant was discovered, following a required background check which occurred after Nelly scored jackpot wins at the Hollywood Casino and Hotel in Maryland Heights. After Nelly was pulled over and handcuffed, for the no proof of insurance charge, his car was searched, and the four ecstasy pills were discovered in his possession. According to a statement released by the Missouri State Highway Patrol, the initial patrol contact with Nelly occurred during an &quot;identification verification in accordance with the Missouri Gaming Commission regulations.&quot; The arrest warrant had been issued based on a June 2018 infraction, which involved Nelly operating a vehicle without proof of insurance.

On November 12, 2024, Chris King, a spokesperson for the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney&#x27;s Office, stated that Nelly would not face charges. King claimed that &quot;We don&#x27;t believe the facts in this case warrant the issuing of charges.&quot;

<doc id="169409" wikidata="Q8" url="?curid=169409" title="Happiness">
<text>Happiness is a complex and multifaceted emotion that encompasses a range of positive feelings, from contentment to intense joy. It is often associated with positive life experiences, such as achieving goals, spending time with loved ones, or engaging in enjoyable activities. However, happiness can also arise spontaneously, without any apparent external cause.

Happiness is closely linked to well-being and overall life satisfaction. Studies have shown that individuals who experience higher levels of happiness tend to have better physical and mental health, stronger social relationships, and greater resilience in the face of adversity.

The pursuit of happiness has been a central theme in philosophy and psychology for centuries. While there is no single, universally accepted definition of happiness, it is generally understood to be a state of mind characterized by positive emotions, a sense of purpose, and a feeling of fulfillment.

== Definitions ==
&quot;Happiness&quot; is subject to debate on usage and meaning, and on possible differences in understanding by culture.

The word is mostly used in relation to two factors:
* the current experience of the feeling of an emotion (affect) such as pleasure or joy, or of a more general sense of &#x27;emotional condition as a whole&#x27;. For instance Daniel Kahneman has defined happiness as &quot;what I experience here and now&quot;. This usage is prevalent in dictionary definitions of happiness.
* appraisal of life satisfaction, such as of quality of life. For instance Ruut Veenhoven has defined happiness as &quot;overall appreciation of one&#x27;s life as-a-whole.&quot; &quot;&#x27;Happiness&#x27; is often used, in ordinary life, to refer to a short-lived state of a person, frequently a feeling of contentment: &#x27;You look happy today&#x27;; &#x27;I&#x27;m very happy for you&#x27;. Philosophically, its scope is more often wider, encompassing a whole life. And in philosophy it is possible to speak of the happiness of a person&#x27;s life, or of their happy life, even if that person was in fact usually pretty miserable. The point is that some good things in their life made it a happy one, even though they lacked contentment. But this usage is uncommon, and may cause confusion.&#x27; Kahneman has said that this is more important to people than current experience.

Some usages can include both of these factors. Subjective well-being (swb) includes measures of current experience (emotions, moods, and feelings) and of life satisfaction. For instance Sonja Lyubomirsky has described happiness as &quot;the experience of joy, contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one&#x27;s life is good, meaningful, and worthwhile.&quot; Eudaimonia, is a Greek term variously translated as happiness, welfare, flourishing, and blessedness. Xavier Landes has proposed that happiness include measures of subjective well-being, mood and eudaimonia.

These differing uses can give different results. Whereas Nordic countries often score highest on swb surveys, South American countries score higher on affect-based surveys of current positive life experiencing.

The implied meaning of the word may vary depending on context, qualifying happiness as a polyseme and a fuzzy concept.

A further issue is when measurement is made; appraisal of a level of happiness at the time of the experience may be different from appraisal via memory at a later date.

Some users accept these issues, but continue to use the word because of its convening power.

===Happiness vs joy===
German philosophy professor Michela Summa says that the distinction between joy and happiness is that &quot;joy accompanies the process through and through, whereas happiness seems to be more strictly tied to the moment of achievement of the process... joy is not only a direct emotional response to an event that is embedded in our life-concerns but is also tightly bound to the present moment, whereas happiness presupposes an evaluative stance concerning one period of one&#x27;s life or one&#x27;s own life as a whole.&quot;

==Measurement==

People have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. In 1780, the English utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans, it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing.

Today, happiness is typically measured using self-report surveys. Self-reporting is prone to cognitive biases and other sources of errors, such as peak–end rule. Studies show that memories of felt emotions can be inaccurate. Affective forecasting research shows that people are poor predictors of their future emotions, including how happy they will be.

Happiness economists are not overly concerned with philosophical and methodological issues and continue to use questionaries to measure average happiness of populations.

Several scales have been developed to measure happiness:
* The Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS) is a four-item scale, measuring global subjective happiness from 1999. The scale requires participants to use absolute ratings to characterize themselves as happy or unhappy individuals, as well as it asks to what extent they identify themselves with descriptions of happy and unhappy individuals.
* The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) from 1988 is a 20-item questionnaire, using a five-point Likert scale (1 = very slightly or not at all, 5 = extremely) to assess the relation between personality traits and positive or negative affects at &quot;this moment, today, the past few days, the past week, the past few weeks, the past year, and in general&quot;. A longer version with additional affect scales was published 1994.
* The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) is a global cognitive assessment of life satisfaction developed by Ed Diener. A seven-point Likert scale is used to agree or disagree with five statements about one&#x27;s life.
* The Cantril ladder method has been used in the World Happiness Report. Respondents are asked to think of a ladder, with the best possible life for them being a 10, and the worst possible life being a 0. They are then asked to rate their own current lives on that 0 to 10 scale.
* Positive Experience; the survey by Gallup asks if, the day before, people experienced enjoyment, laughing or smiling a lot, feeling well-rested, being treated with respect, learning or doing something interesting. 9 of the top 10 countries in 2018 were South American, led by Paraguay and Panama. Country scores range from 85 to 43.
*The Oxford Happiness Inventory is a comprehensive assessment tool consisting of 29 items, in which the person has to chose one of four options. It is user-friendly and easy to administer. This questionnaire shows the amount of well-being of a person. Providing quality insights of the happiness of one person.

Since 2012, a World Happiness Report has been published. Happiness is evaluated, as in &quot;How happy are you with your life as a whole?&quot;, and in emotional reports, as in &quot;How happy are you now?,&quot; and people seem able to use happiness as appropriate in these verbal contexts. Using these measures, the report identifies the countries with the highest levels of happiness. In subjective well-being measures, the primary distinction is between cognitive life evaluations and emotional reports.

The UK began to measure national well-being in 2012, following Bhutan, which had already been measuring gross national happiness.

Academic economists and international economic organizations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. There are many different contributors to adult wellbeing, such as the point that happiness judgements partly reflect the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course. Although these factors play a role in happiness, they do not all need to improve simultaneously to help one achieve an increase in happiness.

Happiness has been found to be quite stable over time.

==Genetics and heritability==

, no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found; the topic is being researched at the Lee Kum Sheung Center for Health and Happiness at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
A positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brain&#x27;s gray matter in the right precuneus area and one&#x27;s subjective happiness score.

Sonja Lyubomirsky has estimated that 50 percent of a given human&#x27;s happiness level could be genetically determined, 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control.

When discussing genetics and their effects on individuals it is important to first understand that genetics do not predict behavior. It is possible for genes to increase the likelihood of individuals being happier compared to others, but they do not 100 percent predict behavior.

At this point in scientific research, it has been hard to find a lot of evidence to support this idea that happiness is affected in some way by genetics. In a 2016 study, Michael Minkov and Michael Harris Bond found that a gene by the name of SLC6A4 was not a good predictor of happiness level in humans.

On the other hand, there have been many studies that have found genetics to be a key part in predicting and understanding happiness in humans. In a review article discussing many studies on genetics and happiness, they discussed the common findings. The author found an important factor that has affected scientist findings this being how happiness is measured. For example, in certain studies when subjective wellbeing is measured as a trait heredity is found to be higher, about 70 to 90 percent. In another study, 11,500 unrelated genotypes were studied, and the conclusion was the heritability was only 12 to 18 percent. Overall, this article found the common percent of heredity was about 20 to 50 percent.

== Causes and achievement methods ==

Theories on how to achieve happiness include &quot;encountering unexpected positive events&quot;, &quot;seeing a significant other&quot;, and &quot;basking in the acceptance and praise of others&quot;.
Some others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures.

Research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of Diener, Ryff, Keyes, and Seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including &quot;the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life.&quot; The psychiatrist George Vaillant and the director of longitudinal Study of Adult Development at Harvard University Robert J. Waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships. Research showed that adequate sleep contributes to well-being. Good mental health and good relationships contribute more to happiness than income does. In 2018, Laurie R. Santos course titled &quot;Psychology and the Good Life&quot; became the most popular course in the history of Yale University and was made available for free online to non-Yale students.

Some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way. Kahneman has said that &quot;&quot;When you look at what people want for themselves, how they pursue their goals, they seem more driven by the search for satisfaction than the search for happiness.&quot;

Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist and prisoner in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II, noticed that those who lost hope soon died, while those who held to meaning and purpose tended to live on. Frankl observed that joy and misery had more to do with a person&#x27;s perspective and choice than with their surroundings. Three key sources of meaning that he highlights in his writings include the following:

# Creation of an important work, or doing a deed. 
# Love, as manifest in thoroughly encountering another person or experience. 
# Finding meaning in unavoidable suffering, such as seeing it as a sacrifice or learning opportunity.

Psychologist Robert Emmons has identified the centrality of goals in pursuing happiness. He found that when humans pursue meaningful projects and activities without primarily focusing on happiness, happiness often results as a by-product. Indicators of meaningfulness predict positive effects on life, while lack of meaning predicts negative states such as psychological distress. Emmons summarizes the four categories of meaning which have appeared throughout various studies. He proposes to call them WIST, or work, intimacy, spirituality, and transcendence.

Throughout life, one&#x27;s views of happiness and what brings happiness can evolve. In early and emerging adulthood many people focus on seeking happiness through friends, objects, and money. Middle aged-adults generally transition from searching for object-based happiness to looking for happiness in money and relationships. In older adulthood, people tend to focus more on personal peace and lasting relationships (ex. children, spouse, grandchildren). Antti Kauppinen, a Swedish philosopher and phenomenological researcher, posited that the perception of time affects the change in focus throughout life. In early adulthood, most view life optimistically, looking to the future and seeing an entire life ahead of them. Those that fall into the middle life, see that life has passed behind them as well as seeing more life ahead. Those in older adulthood often see their lives as behind them. This shift in perspective causes a shift in the pursuit of happiness from more tactile, object based happiness, to social and relational based happiness.

=== Self-fulfilment theories ===
Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. When a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, self-actualization is reached. Beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, Maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. This is similar to the flow concept of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi. The concept of flow is the idea that after our basic needs are met we can achieve greater happiness by altering our consciousness by becoming so engaged in a task that we lose our sense of time. Our intense focus causes us to forget any other issues, which in return promotes positive emotions.

Erich Fromm said &quot;Happiness is the indication that man has found the answer to the problem of human existence: the productive realization of his potentialities and thus, simultaneously, being one with the world and preserving the integrity of his self. In spending his energy productively he increases his powers, he „burns without being consumed.&quot;&quot;
Self-determination theory relates intrinsic motivation to three needs: competence, autonomy, and relatedness. Competence refers to an individual&#x27;s ability to be effective in their interactions with the environment, autonomy refers to a person&#x27;s flexibility in choice and decision making, and relatedness is the need to establish warm, close personal relationships.

Ronald Inglehart has traced cross-national differences in the level of happiness based on data from the World Values Survey. He finds that the extent to which a society allows free choice has a major impact on happiness. When basic needs are satisfied, the degree of happiness depends on economic and cultural factors that enable free choice in how people live their lives. Happiness also depends on religion in countries where free choice is constrained.

Sigmund Freud said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we &quot;are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things.&quot;

The idea of motivational hedonism is the theory that pleasure is the aim for human life.

===Positive psychology===
Since 2000 the field of positive psychology, which focuses on the study of happiness and human flourishing rather than maladjusted behavior or illness, expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications. It has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness, such as positive social interactions with family and friends.

These factors include six key virtues:

1. Wisdom and knowledge, which includes creativity, curiosity, love of learning and open-mindedness.

2. Courage, which includes bravery, persistence, integrity, and vitality.

3. Humanity, which includes love, kindness, and social intelligence.

4. Justice, which includes leadership, fairness, and loyalty.

5. Temperance, which includes self-regulation, prudence, forgiveness, humility, patience and modesty.

6. Transcendence, which includes religious/spirituality, hope, gratitude, appreciation of beauty and excellence, and humor.

In order for a virtue to be considered a key strength in the field of positive psychology it must meet the demands of 12 criteria, namely ubiquity (cross-cultural), fulfilling, morally valued, does not diminish others, be a nonfelicitous opposite (have a clear antonym that is negative), traitlike, measurable, distinct, have paragons (distinctly show up in individuals&#x27; behaviors), have prodigies (show up in youth), be selectively absent (distinctly does not show up in some individuals), and is supported by some institutions.

Numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.

Yale researcher Emma Seppälä has emphasized the importance of compassion for others, balanced with self-compassion. Compassion for others may involve service and volunteering, or simply reaching out to connect, show gratitude, or draw others together.

=== Spillover ===
A person&#x27;s level of subjective well-being is determined by many different factors and social influences prove to be a strong one. Results from the famous Framingham Heart Study indicate that friends three degrees of separation away (that is, friends of friends of friends) can affect a person&#x27;s happiness. From abstract: &quot;A friend who lives within a mile (about 1.6 km) and who becomes happy increases the probability that a person is happy by 25%.&quot;

===Indirect approaches===
Various writers, including Camus and Tolle, have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy.

John Stuart Mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. This meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on one&#x27;s happiness. Then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would &quot;inhale happiness with the air you breathe.&quot;

William Inge said that &quot;on the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so.&quot; Orison Swett Marden said that &quot;some people are born happy.&quot;

=== Cognitive behavioral therapy ===
Cognitive behavioral therapy is a popular therapeutic method used to change habits by changing thoughts and problematic behaviors. It focuses on emotional regulation and uses a lot of positive psychology practices. It is often used for people with depression, anxiety, or addictions and works towards how to lead a happier life. Common processes in cognitive behavioral therapy are reframing thoughts from problematic thinking patterns by replacing them with beneficial or supportive ones, roleplaying, finding beneficial coping skills, and choosing new activities that support desired behaviors and avoid negative behaviors.

=== Synthetic happiness ===
Coined by Harvard professor of psychology and author of &quot;Stumbling on Happiness&quot;, Daniel Gilbert, synthetic happiness is the happiness we make for ourselves. In his TedTalk titled, the surprising science of happiness, Gilbert explains that everyone possesses a &quot;psychological immune system&quot; that helps to regulate our emotional reactions. Through research that he studied and held, he and his team found that personal happiness is largely based on personal perception. Synthetic happiness as an idea has become more popular as people attempt to define happiness as a journey instead of a destination.

==Effects==
Happiness research understands &quot;happiness&quot; as &quot;life satisfaction&quot; or &quot;well-being&quot;. Since it has proved difficult to find a definition of happiness, individual people are instead asked how happy they feel. Numerous surveys are then summarized and analyzed using static methods. Although some researchers believe that the scales are fundamentally unsuitable for estimating happiness, other researchers argue that the happiness indices formed on the basis of the survey have a high statistical correspondence with characteristics that are generally understood to indicate a happy person. For example, individuals who report high happiness on scales smile more often, exhibit more social behavior, are more helpful, and are less likely to commit suicide. For this reason, happiness indices determined on the basis of the survey are considered reliable by happiness researchers.

Before recommending strategies, it is crucial to rely on rigorous, large-scale experiments that confirm their effectiveness. Over the past decade, there has been a significant shift in what constitutes &#x27;high-quality evidence&#x27; in psychology (there were adopted e. g. practices like pre-registration, committing to specific methodological and analytical decisions in advance, and increased sample sizes to avoid underpowered studies). A meta analysis of 2023 has used this modern evidence-based approach, evaluating evidence for common happiness-boosting strategies. The study aimed to shed light on the effectiveness of these strategies and their impact on subjective well-being. As a first step, the authors analyzed numerous media articles on happiness to identify the five most commonly recommended strategies, these were: expressing gratitude, enhancing sociability, exercising, practicing mindfulness/meditation, and increasing exposure to nature. Next, the published scientific literature was searched but limited to the above-described high-quality criteria that tested the effects of these strategies on subjective well-being in everyday individuals (non-clinical samples). Only 10% of the initially retrieved studies met those rigorous criteria. The findings revealed that unlike so far suggested by scientific studies, there is currently still a lack of robust scientific evidence to support some of the most frequently suggested happiness strategies. Among the five most common happiness strategies, there was &quot;reasonably solid evidence&quot; of positive effects from a) Gratitude messages or lists, b) conversations with strangers or Gratitude and sociability – that is, establishing and maintaining social relationships. In contrast, no convincing evidence could be found that c) sports, d) mindfulness training, or e) walks in the countryside make people happier.

===Positive===
There is a wealth of cross-sectional studies on happiness and physical health that shows consistent positive relationships. Follow-up studies appear to show that happiness does not predict longevity in sick populations, but that it does predict longevity among healthy populations.

Other positive effects of happiness and being in a good mood, that have been studied and confirmed, are that happier people tend to be more helpful, attentive, and generous to others, as well as to themselves. Happy people also have been shown to act more cooperatively and less aggressively, and be more likely to help others in need. They were also found to be more sociable and communicative.

More positive effects that happiness seems to evoke are creative problem solving, persisting through challenges, more intrinsic motivation for work related or responsible tasks, and being more effective at using efficient decision-making strategies.

While some believe that success breeds happiness, Lyubomirsky, King and Diener found that happiness precedes success in income, relationships, marriages, work performance, and health.

Low mood is correlated with many negative life outcomes such as suicide, poor health, substance abuse, and low life expectancy. By extension, happiness protects from those negative outcomes.

===Negative===
June Gruber argued that happiness may trigger a person to be more sensitive, more gullible, less successful, and more likely to undertake high risk behaviours. She also conducted studies suggesting that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failure to meet over-high expectations. Iris Mauss has shown that the more people strive for happiness, the more likely they will set up too high of standards and feel disappointed. One study shows that women who value happiness more tend to react less positively to happy emotions. A 2012 study found that psychological well-being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions.

== Society and culture ==
=== Government ===

Jeremy Bentham believed that public policy should attempt to maximize happiness, and he even attempted to estimate a &quot;hedonic calculus&quot;. Thomas Jefferson put the &quot;pursuit of happiness&quot; on the same level as life and liberty in the United States Declaration of Independence. Presently, many countries and organizations regularly measure population happiness through large-scale surveys, e.g., Bhutan.

Richer nations tend to have higher measures of happiness than poorer nations. The relationship between wealth and happiness is not linear and the same GDP increase in poor countries will have more effect on happiness than in wealthy countries.

Some political scientists argue that life satisfaction is positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. Others argue that happiness is strongly correlated with economic freedom, preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy.

===Cultural values===

Personal happiness can be affected by cultural factors. Hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures. Forcing people to marry and stay married can have adverse consequences. Research has shown that unhappily married couples suffer 3–25 times the risk of developing clinical depression.

One theory is that higher SWB in richer countries is related to their more individualistic cultures. Individualistic cultures may satisfy intrinsic motivations to a higher degree than collectivistic cultures, and fulfilling intrinsic motivations, as opposed to extrinsic motivations, may relate to greater levels of happiness, leading to more happiness in individualistic cultures.

Cultural views on happiness have changed over time. For instance Western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century. Not all cultures seek to maximize happiness, and some cultures are averse to happiness. It has been found in Western cultures that individual happiness is the most important. Some other cultures have opposite views and tend to be aversive to the idea of individual happiness. For example, people living in Eastern Asian cultures focus more on the need for happiness within relationships with others and even find personal happiness to be harmful to fulfilling happy social relationships.

=== Religion ===
People in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries.

==== Buddhism ====

Happiness forms a central theme of Buddhist teachings. For ultimate freedom from suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leads its practitioner to Nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. Ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. More mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people (see &quot;sukha&quot;). Buddhism also encourages the generation of loving kindness and compassion, the desire for the happiness and welfare of all beings.

====Hinduism====
In Advaita Vedanta, the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between Atman and Brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the Self in all.

Patanjali, author of the Yoga Sutras, wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.

====Confucianism====
The Chinese Confucian thinker Mencius, who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during China&#x27;s Warring States period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the &quot;lesser self&quot; (the physiological self) and the &quot;greater self&quot; (the moral self), and that getting the priorities right between these two would lead to sage-hood. He argued that if one did not feel satisfaction or pleasure in nourishing one&#x27;s &quot;vital force&quot; with &quot;righteous deeds&quot;, then that force would shrivel up (Mencius, 6A:15 2A:2). More specifically, he mentions the experience of intoxicating joy if one celebrates the practice of the great virtues, especially through music.

==== Judaism ====

Happiness or &quot;simcha&quot; () in Judaism is considered an important element in the service of God. The biblical verse &quot;worship The Lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs,&quot; () stresses joy in the service of God. A popular teaching by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, a 19th-century Chassidic Rabbi, is &quot;&quot;Mitzvah Gedolah Le&#x27;hiyot Besimcha Tamid&quot;,&quot; it is a great mitzvah (commandment) to always be in a state of happiness. When a person is happy they are much more capable of serving God and going about their daily activities than when depressed or upset.

==== Christianity ====

The primary meaning of &quot;happiness&quot; in various European languages involves good fortune, blessing, or a similar happening. The meaning in Greek philosophy refers primarily to ethics.

In Christianity, the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, Latin equivalent to the Greek &quot;eudaimonia&quot; (&quot;blessed happiness&quot;), described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian Thomas Aquinas as a beatific vision of God&#x27;s essence in the next life.

According to Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas, man&#x27;s last end is happiness: &quot;all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness.&quot; Aquinas agreed with Aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to virtue.

According to Aquinas, happiness consists in an &quot;operation of the speculative intellect&quot;: &quot;Consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of Divine things.&quot; And, &quot;the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect.&quot; So: &quot;Therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. But imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions.&quot;

Human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. In temporal life, the contemplation of God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. &quot;Beatitudo&quot;, or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.

====Islam====
Al-Ghazali (1058–1111), the Sufi thinker, wrote that &quot;The Alchemy of Happiness&quot; is a manual of religious instruction that is used throughout the Muslim world and widely practiced today.

== Philosophy ==

===Relation to morality===
Philosophy of happiness is often discussed in conjunction with ethics. Traditional European societies, inherited from the Greeks and from Christianity, often linked happiness with morality. In this context, morality was the performance in a specific role in a certain kind of social life.

Happiness remains a difficult term for moral philosophy. Throughout the history of moral philosophy, there has been an oscillation between attempts to define morality in terms of consequences leading to happiness or defining it as nothing to do with happiness at all.

In psychology, connections between happiness and morality have been studied in a variety of ways. Empirical research suggests that laypeople&#x27;s judgments of a person&#x27;s happiness in part depend on perceptions of that person&#x27;s morality, suggesting that judgments of others&#x27; happiness involve moral evaluation. A large body of research also suggests that engaging in prosocial behavior can increase happiness.

===Ethics===
Ethicists have made arguments for how humans should behave, either individually or collectively, based on the resulting happiness of such behavior. Utilitarians, such as John Stuart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, advocated the greatest happiness principle as a guide for ethical behavior. This principle states that actions are proportionately right or wrong by how much happiness or unhappiness they bring. Mill defines happiness as that which brings about an intended pleasure and avoids an unnecessary pain, and he defines unhappiness as the reverse, namely an action that brings about pain and not pleasure. He is quick to specify that pleasure and pain are to be understood in an Epicurean light, referring chiefly to the higher human pleasures of increased intellect, feelings, and moral sentiments not what one might call beastly pleasures of mere animal appetites. Critics of this view include Thomas Carlyle, Ferdinand Tönnies and others within the German philosophical tradition. They posit that a greater happiness is to be found in choosing to suffer for others, rather than allowing others to suffer for them, declaring this to be a form of satisfying, and heroic, nobility.

Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found that those who exhibit volunteerism also have better current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered had higher life satisfaction and will to live, and less depression, anxiety, and somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well, attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over 30 years and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults aged 55 and older found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality.

===Aristotle===
Aristotle described &quot;eudaimonia&quot; (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) as the goal of human thought and action. Eudaimonia is often translated to mean happiness, but some scholars contend that &quot;human flourishing&quot; may be a more accurate translation. Aristotle&#x27;s use of the term in Nicomachiean Ethics extends beyond the general sense of happiness.

In the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, written in 350 BCE, Aristotle stated that happiness (also being well and doing well) is the only thing that humans desire for their own sake, unlike riches, honour, health or friendship. He observed that men sought riches, or honour, or health not only for their own sake but also in order to be happy. For Aristotle the term &quot;eudaimonia&quot;, which is translated as &#x27;happiness&#x27; or &#x27;flourishing&#x27; is an activity rather than an emotion or a state. Eudaimonia (Greek: εὐδαιμονία) is a classical Greek word consists of the word &quot;eu&quot; (&quot;good&quot; or &quot;well-being&quot;) and &quot;daimōn&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot; or &quot;minor deity&quot;, used by extension to mean one&#x27;s lot or fortune). Thus understood, the happy life is the good life, that is, a life in which a person fulfills human nature in an excellent way.

Specifically, Aristotle argued that the good life is the life of excellent rational activity. He arrived at this claim with the &quot;Function Argument&quot;. Basically, if it is right, every living thing has a function, that which it uniquely does. For Aristotle human function is to reason, since it is that alone which humans uniquely do. And performing one&#x27;s function well, or excellently, is good. According to Aristotle, the life of excellent rational activity is the happy life. Aristotle argued a second-best life for those incapable of excellent rational activity was the life of moral virtue.

The key question Aristotle seeks to answer is &quot;What is the ultimate purpose of human existence?&quot; A lot of people are seeking pleasure, health, and a good reputation. It is true that those have a value, but none of them can occupy the place of the greatest good for which humanity aims. It may seem like all goods are a means to obtain happiness, but Aristotle said that happiness is always an end in itself.

===Nietzsche===
Friedrich Nietzsche critiqued the English Utilitarians&#x27; focus on attaining the greatest happiness, stating that &quot;Man does not strive for happiness, only the Englishman does&quot;. Nietzsche meant that making happiness one&#x27;s ultimate &quot;goal&quot; and the aim of one&#x27;s existence, in his words &quot;makes one contemptible.&quot; Nietzsche instead yearned for a culture that would set higher, more difficult goals than &quot;mere happiness.&quot; He introduced the quasi-dystopic figure of the &quot;last man&quot; as a kind of thought experiment against the utilitarians and happiness-seekers.

These small, &quot;last men&quot; who seek after only their own pleasure and health, avoiding all danger, exertion, difficulty, challenge, struggle are meant to seem contemptible to Nietzsche&#x27;s reader. Nietzsche instead wants us to consider the value of what is difficult, what can only be earned through struggle, difficulty, pain and thus to come to see the affirmative value suffering and &quot;unhappiness&quot; truly play in creating everything of great worth in life, including all the highest achievements of human culture, not least of all philosophy.

<doc id="169410" wikidata="Q153056" url="?curid=169410" title="Destiny's Child">
<text>Destiny&#x27;s Child was an American girl group whose final lineup comprised Beyoncé Knowles, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams. The group began their musical career as Girl&#x27;s Tyme, formed in 1990 in Houston, Texas. After years of limited success, the original quartet comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records as Destiny&#x27;s Child. The group was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of the song &quot;No, No, No&quot; and their best-selling second album, &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; (1999), which contained the number-one singles &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot; and &quot;Say My Name&quot;, alongside successful singles &quot;Bug a Boo&quot; and &quot;Jumpin&#x27;, Jumpin&#x27;&quot;. Despite critical and commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict and legal turmoil, as Roberson and Luckett attempted to split from the group&#x27;s manager Mathew Knowles due to favoritism of Knowles and Rowland.

In early 2000, both Roberson and Luckett were replaced with Williams and Farrah Franklin; however, Franklin quit after a few months, leaving the group as a trio. Their third album, &quot;Survivor&quot; (2001), whose themes the public interpreted as a channel to the group&#x27;s experience, produced the worldwide hits &quot;Independent Women&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Bootylicious&quot;. Later that year, they also released a Christmas album titled &quot;8 Days of Christmas&quot;, and announced a hiatus to pursue solo careers. The trio reunited two years later for the release of their fifth and final studio album, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; (2004), which spawned the international hits &quot;Lose My Breath&quot; and &quot;Soldier&quot;. Since the group&#x27;s official disbandment in 2006, Knowles, Rowland, and Williams have reunited several times, including at the 2013 Super Bowl halftime show and the 2018 Coachella festival.

Destiny&#x27;s Child has sold more than 60 million records . &quot;Billboard&quot; ranks the group as one of the greatest musical trios of all time, the ninth most successful artist/band of the 2000s, and placed the group 68th in its All-Time Hot 100 Artists list in 2008 and in December 2016, the magazine ranked them as the 90th most successful dance club artist of all time. The group was nominated for 14 Grammy Awards, winning twice for Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals and once for Best R&amp;B Song.

== History ==

=== 1990–1997: Early beginnings and Girl&#x27;s Tyme ===
In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met LaTavia Roberson at an audition for a girl group. Based in Houston, Texas, they were joined to a group that performed rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who moved into Knowles&#x27; house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl&#x27;s Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl&#x27;s Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R&amp;B producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios in Northern California, with focus on Knowles&#x27; vocals because Frager thought she had personality and the ability to sing. With efforts to sign Girl&#x27;s Tyme to a major record deal, Frager&#x27;s strategy was to debut the group in &quot;Star Search&quot;, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.

Because of the group&#x27;s defeat, Knowles&#x27; father, Mathew, voluntarily dedicated his time to manage them. He decided to cut the original lineup to four, with the removal of Davis and the Taylor sisters and the inclusion of LeToya Luckett in 1993. Aside from spending time at their church in Houston, Girl&#x27;s Tyme practiced in their backyards and at the Headliners Salon, owned by Knowles&#x27; mother, Tina. The group would test routines in the salon, when it was on Montrose Boulevard in Houston, and sometimes would collect tips from the customers. Their try-out would be critiqued by the people inside. During their school days, Girl&#x27;s Tyme performed at local gigs. When summer came, Mathew Knowles established a &quot;boot camp&quot; to train them in dance and vocal lessons. After rigorous training, they began performing as opening acts for established R&amp;B groups of that time such as SWV, Dru Hill and Immature. Tina Knowles designed the group&#x27;s stage attire.

Over the course of the early years in their career, Girl&#x27;s Tyme changed their name to Somethin&#x27; Fresh, Cliché, The Dolls, and to Destiny. The group signed with Elektra Records with the name Destiny, but were dropped several months later before they could release an album. The pursuit of a record deal affected the Knowles family: in 1995, Mathew Knowles resigned from his job as a medical-equipment salesman, a move that reduced Knowles&#x27; family&#x27;s income by half, and her parents briefly separated due to the pressure. In 1996, they changed their name to Destiny&#x27;s Child. Group members have claimed that the name was taken from a passage in the Bible: &quot;We got the word destiny out of the Bible, but we couldn&#x27;t trademark the name, so we added child, which is like a rebirth of destiny,&quot; said Knowles. The word &quot;Destiny&quot; was stated to have been chosen from the Book of Isaiah, by Tina Knowles.

Mathew Knowles helped in negotiating a record deal with Columbia Records at the behest of Columbia scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites, which signed the group that same year. Prior to signing with Columbia, the group had recorded several tracks in Oakland, California produced by D&#x27;wayne Wiggins of Tony! Toni! Toné!. Upon the label&#x27;s recognition that Destiny&#x27;s Child had a &quot;unique quality&quot;, the track &quot;Killing Time&quot; was included in the soundtrack to the 1997 film &quot;Men in Black&quot;.

=== 1997–2000: Breakthrough and lineup changes ===
Destiny&#x27;s Child first charted in November 1997 with &quot;No, No, No&quot;, the lead single from their self-titled debut album, which was released in the United States on February 17, 1998, featuring productions by Tim &amp; Bob, Rob Fusari, Jermaine Dupri, Wyclef Jean, Dwayne Wiggins and Corey Rooney. &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot; peaked at number sixty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number fourteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. It managed to sell over one million copies in the United States, earning a platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The remix version to &quot;No, No, No&quot;, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks and number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Its follow-up single, &quot;With Me Part 1&quot; failed to reproduce the success of &quot;No, No, No&quot;. Meanwhile, the group featured on a song from the soundtrack album of the romantic drama &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love&quot; and &quot;Get on the Bus&quot; had a limited release in Europe and other markets. In 1998, Destiny&#x27;s Child garnered three Soul Train Lady of Soul awards including Best New Artist for &quot;No, No, No&quot;. Later that year, the group was featured in an episode of the TV sitcom Smart Guy. Knowles considered their debut successful but not huge, claiming as a neo soul record it was too mature for the group at the time.

After the success of their debut album, Destiny&#x27;s Child re-entered the studio quickly, bringing in a new lineup of producers, including Kevin &quot;She&#x27;kspere&quot; Briggs and Rodney Jerkins. Coming up with &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot;, they released it on July 27, 1999, and it eventually became their breakthrough album. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number two on R&amp;B chart in early 2000. &quot;Bills, Bills, Bills&quot; was released in 1999 as the album&#x27;s lead single and reached the top spot of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming their first US number-one single. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; has been credited as Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s breakthrough album, spurring their career and introducing them to a wider audience.

In late 1999, Destiny&#x27;s Child were to appear on two songs for Columbia Records labelmates: &quot;Thug Love&quot; for rapper 50 Cent&#x27;s debut album &quot;Power of the Dollar&quot;, and &quot;Baby Baby Baby&quot; for American basketball player Kobe Bryant&#x27;s debut rap album &quot;Visions&quot;. Both albums were shelved: 50 Cent would be shot nine times, postponing all promotional activities three days before their collaboration video could be filmed, and Bryant&#x27;s album did not live up to label expectations. Their collaboration with Bryant would later leak alongside the rest of the album in 2021.
On December 14, 1999, Luckett and Roberson attempted to split with their manager, claiming that he kept a disproportionate share of the group&#x27;s profits and unfairly favored Knowles and Rowland. While they never intended to leave the group, when the video for &quot;Say My Name&quot;, the third single from &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot;, surfaced in February 2000, Roberson and Luckett found out that two new members were joining Knowles and Rowland. Prior to the video premiere, Knowles announced on &quot;TRL&quot; that original members Luckett and Roberson had left the group. They were replaced by Michelle Williams, a former backup singer to Monica, and Farrah Franklin, an aspiring singer-actress. Shortly after her stint with Monica, Williams was introduced to Destiny&#x27;s Child by a choreographer friend, and was flown to Houston where she stayed with the Knowles family.

On March 21, 2000, Roberson and Luckett filed a lawsuit against Mathew Knowles and their former bandmates for breach of partnership and fiduciary duties. Following the suit, both sides were disparaging towards each other in the media. Five months after joining, Franklin left the group. The remaining members claimed that this was due to missed promotional appearances and concerts. According to Williams, Franklin could not handle stress. Franklin, however, disclosed that she left because of the negativity surrounding the strife and her inability to assert any control in the decision-making. Her departure was seen as less controversial. Williams, on the other hand, disclosed that her inclusion in the group resulted in her &quot;battling insecurity&quot;: &quot;I was comparing myself to the other members, and the pressure was on me.&quot;

Towards the end of 2000, Roberson and Luckett dropped the portion of their lawsuit aimed at Rowland and Knowles in exchange for a settlement, though they continued the action against their manager. As part of the agreement, both sides were prohibited from speaking about each other publicly. Roberson and Luckett formed another girl group named Anjel but also left it due to issues with the record company. Although band members were affected by the turmoil, the publicity made Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s success even bigger and they became a pop culture phenomenon. &quot;Say My Name&quot; topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for three consecutive weeks, while the fourth single, &quot;Jumpin&#x27;, Jumpin&#x27;&quot;, also became a top-ten hit. &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot; eventually sold over eight million copies in the United States, gaining eight-time platinum certification by the RIAA. The album sold more than 11 million copies worldwide and was one of the top-selling albums of 2000. During this time, Destiny&#x27;s Child began performing as an opening act at the concerts of pop singers Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.

With Williams in the new lineup, Destiny&#x27;s Child released a theme song for the soundtrack to the 2000 film &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Released as a single in October 2000, &quot;Independent Women Part 1&quot; spent eleven consecutive weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 from November 2000 to January 2001, the longest-running number-one single of Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s career and of that year in the United States. The successful release of the single boosted the sales of the soundtrack album to &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; to 1.5 million by 2001. In 2000, Destiny&#x27;s Child won Soul Train&#x27;s Sammy Davis Jr. Entertainer of the Year award.

=== 2000–2003: &quot;Survivor&quot;, subsequent releases, hiatus and side projects ===
At the 2001 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards, Destiny&#x27;s Child won several accolades, including Artist of the Year and Duo/Group of the Year, and again won Artist of the Year among five awards they snagged in 2001. In September 2000, the group took home two at the sixth annual Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards, including R&amp;B/Soul Album of the Year, Group for &quot;The Writing&#x27;s on the Wall&quot;. Destiny&#x27;s Child recorded their third album, &quot;Survivor&quot;, from mid-2000 until early 2001. In the production process, Knowles assumed more control in co-producing and co-writing almost the entire album. &quot;Survivor&quot; hit record stores in the spring of 2001 and entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number one, selling over 663,000 copies in its first week sales. The first three singles, &quot;Independent Women Part I&quot;, &quot;Survivor&quot; and &quot;Bootylicious&quot; reached the top three in the United States and were also successful in other countries; the first two were consecutive number-one singles in the United Kingdom. The album was certified four-time platinum in the United States and double platinum in Australia. It sold 6 million copies as of July 27, 2001.

In the wake of the September 11 attacks, Destiny&#x27;s Child canceled a European tour and performed in a concert benefit for the survivors. In October 2001, the group released a holiday album, &quot;8 Days of Christmas&quot;, which contained updated versions of several Christmas songs. The album managed to reach number thirty-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In February 2001, Destiny&#x27;s Child won two Grammy awards for &quot;Say My Name&quot;: Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group and Best R&amp;B Song. They also earned an American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Band/Duo. Also in 2001, Destiny&#x27;s Child sang backup vocals for Solange Knowles, who was the lead, on the theme song to the animated Disney Channel series &quot;The Proud Family&quot;. In March 2002, a remix compilation titled &quot;This Is the Remix&quot; was released to win fans over before a new studio album would be released. The remix album reached number 29 in the United States. The lead single &quot;Survivor&quot; was by some interpreted as a response to the strife between the band members, although Knowles claimed it was not directed at anybody. Seeing it as a breach of the agreement that barred each party from public disparagement, Roberson and Luckett once again filed a lawsuit against Destiny&#x27;s Child and Sony Music, shortly following the release of &quot;This Is the Remix&quot;. In June 2002, remaining cases were settled in court.

In late 2000, Destiny&#x27;s Child announced their plan to embark on individual side projects, including releases of solo albums, an idea by their manager. In 2002, Williams released her solo album, &quot;Heart to Yours&quot;, a contemporary gospel collection. The album reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Gospel Albums chart. In the same date &quot;Heart to Yours&quot; hit stores, Destiny&#x27;s Child released their official autobiography, &quot;Soul Survivors&quot;. Rowland collaborated with hip hop artist Nelly on &quot;Dilemma&quot;, which became a worldwide hit and earned Rowland a Grammy; she became the first member of Destiny&#x27;s Child to have achieved a US number-one single. In the same year, Knowles co-starred with Mike Myers in the box-office hit &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;. She recorded her first solo single, &quot;Work It Out&quot;, for the film&#x27;s soundtrack. To capitalize on the success of &quot;Dilemma&quot;, Rowland&#x27;s solo debut album &quot;Simply Deep&quot; was brought forward from its early 2003 release to September 2002. Rowland&#x27;s career took off internationally when &quot;Simply Deep&quot; hit number one on the UK Albums Chart. In the same year, she made her feature film debut in the horror film &quot;Freddy vs. Jason&quot;. Meanwhile, Knowles made her second film, &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot;, and appeared as featured vocalist on her then-boyfriend Jay-Z&#x27;s single &quot;&#x27;03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde&quot;, which paved the way for the release of her debut solo album.

Knowles&#x27; debut album, &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;, was postponed many times until being released in June 2003. The album used her first name as a mononymous stage name. Knowles&#x27; release was the most commercially successful among the three solo releases. &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling 317,000 copies. It yielded the number-one hits &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;, and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;; and the top-five singles &quot;Me, Myself and I&quot; and &quot;Naughty Girl&quot;. The album was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It remains as Knowles&#x27; best-selling album to date, with sales of 5 million copies in the United States, as of June 2016. Worldwide, the album has sold more than eleven million copies. Knowles&#x27; solo debut was well received by critics, earning five Grammy awards in one night for &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot;, tying the likes of Norah Jones, Lauryn Hill, and Alicia Keys for most Grammys received in one night by a female artist. In November 2003, Williams appeared as &quot;Aida&quot; on Broadway. In January 2004, she released her second gospel album, &quot;Do You Know&quot;.

D&#x27;wayne Wiggins, who had produced their first recordings as Destiny&#x27;s Child, filed suit in 2002 against his former counsel (Bloom, Hergott, Diemer &amp; Cook LLP) seeking $15 million in damages for lessening his contractual agreement with the group without his consent, effectively nullifying his original contract that offered Sony Music/Columbia Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s exclusive recording services for an initial seven years, in exchange for &quot;certain royalties&quot;, instead of royalties only from the first three albums. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles announced that Destiny&#x27;s Child would expand back to a quartet, revealing Knowles&#x27; younger sister, Solange, as the latest addition to the group. Destiny&#x27;s Child had previously recorded songs with Solange and shared the stage when she temporarily replaced Rowland after she broke her toes while performing. Their manager, however, said the idea was used to test reactions from the public. In August 2003, Knowles herself confirmed that her sister would not be joining in the group, and instead promoted Solange&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Solo Star&quot;, released in January 2003.

=== 2003–2006: &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; and &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; ===
Three years after the hiatus, members of Destiny&#x27;s Child reunited to record their fourth and final studio album, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot;. The album introduces the trio to a harder, &quot;urban&quot; sound, and songs featured are conceptually interrelated. &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; saw equality in the trio: each member contributed to writing on the majority songs, as well as becoming executive producers aside from their manager. Released on November 15, 2004, &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; failed to top &quot;Survivor&quot;; the album reached number two the following week, selling 497,000 copies in its first week, compared to 663,000 for the previous album. Certified three-time platinum in the United States, it was still one of the best-selling albums of 2005, selling over eight million copies worldwide; it pushed the group back into the position of the best-selling female group and American group of the year. Four singles were released from the album: the lead &quot;Lose My Breath&quot;, &quot;Soldier&quot;, &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; and &quot;Girl&quot;; the first two reached number three in the United States. &quot;Soldier&quot; &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; were certified platinum by the RIAA in 2006.

To promote the album, Destiny&#x27;s Child embarked on their worldwide concert tour, Destiny Fulfilled... and Lovin&#x27; It Tour. On June 11, 2005, while at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain, the group announced to the audience of 16,000 people that they planned to officially break up once the tour concluded. Knowles stated that the album&#x27;s title &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; was not a coincidence and reflected the fact that the breakup was already being planned when the album was being recorded. While making the album, they planned to part ways after their fourteen-year career as a group to facilitate their continued pursuit in individual aspirations. Knowles stated that their destinies were already fulfilled. The group sent a letter to MTV about the decision, saying:
We have been working together as Destiny&#x27;s Child since we were 9 and touring together since we were 14. After a lot of discussions and some deep soul searching, we realized that our current tour has given us the opportunity to leave Destiny&#x27;s Child on a high note, united in our friendship and filled with overwhelming gratitude for our music, our fans, and each other. After all these wonderful years working together, we realized that now is the time to pursue our personal goals and solo efforts in earnest...No matter what happens, we will always love each other as friends and sisters and will always support each other as artists. We want to thank all of our fans for their incredible love and support and hope to see you all again as we continue fulfilling our destinies. —Destiny&#x27;s Child, MTV
Destiny&#x27;s Child released their greatest hits album, &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot;, on October 25, 2005. The compilation includes their number-one hits including &quot;Independent Woman Part 1&quot;, &quot;Say My Name&quot; and &quot;Bootylicious&quot;. Three new tracks were recorded for the compilation including &quot;Stand Up for Love&quot;, which was recorded for the theme song to the World Children&#x27;s Day, and &quot;Check on It&quot;, a song Knowles recorded for &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;″s soundtrack. Record producer David Foster, his daughter Amy Foster-Gillies and Knowles wrote &quot;Stand Up for Love&quot; as the anthem to the World Children&#x27;s Day, an annual worldwide event to raise awareness and funds for children causes. Over the past three years, more than $50 million have been raised to benefit Ronald McDonald House Charities and other children&#x27;s organizations. Destiny&#x27;s Child lent their voices and support as global ambassadors for the 2005 program. &quot;#1&#x27;s&quot; was also released as a DualDisc, featuring the same track listing, seven videos of selected songs and a trailer of the concert DVD &quot;Live in Atlanta&quot;. The DVD was filmed during the Atlanta visit of the Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin&#x27; It tour, and was released on March 28, 2006. It has been certified platinum by the RIAA, denoting shipments of over one million units. Notwithstanding the album title, only five of the album&#x27;s 16 tracks had reached #1 on either the Billboard Hot 100 or the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart; writer Keith Caulfield of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine suggested that the title was &quot;a marketing angle&quot;. Despite this, journalist Chris Harris of MTV said that the album &quot;lives up to its name&quot;.

== Disbandment and aftermath ==
Destiny&#x27;s Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19, 2006, in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, &quot;It&#x27;s the last album, but it&#x27;s not the last show.&quot; Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York a few days later. On March 28, 2006, Destiny&#x27;s Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny&#x27;s Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001.

After their formal disbandment, all members resumed their solo careers, each experiencing different levels of success. Since then, Knowles, Rowland, and Williams have continued to collaborate on each other&#x27;s solo projects through song features, music video appearances, and live performances. Both Rowland and Williams, along with Knowles&#x27; sister Solange, appeared in Knowles&#x27; music video for her single &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; (2007). On June 26, 2007, the group made a mini-reunion at the 2007 BET Awards, where Knowles performed &quot;Get Me Bodied&quot; with Williams and Solange as her back-up dancers. After her performance, Knowles introduced Rowland who performed her single &quot;Like This&quot; (2007) with Eve. On the September 2, 2007 Los Angeles stop of The Beyoncé Experience tour, Knowles sang a snippet of &quot;Survivor&quot; with Rowland and Williams, and the latter two rendered a &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; song to Knowles. The performance was featured in Knowles&#x27; tour DVD, &quot;The Beyoncé Experience Live&quot;. In 2008, Knowles recorded a cover of Billy Joel&#x27;s &quot;Honesty&quot; for Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Mathew Knowles &amp; Music World Present Vol.1: Love Destiny&quot;, which was released only in Japan to celebrate the group&#x27;s tenth anniversary.

Rowland made a cameo appearance in Knowles&#x27; music video for her single &quot;Party&quot; (2011), and the group&#x27;s third compilation album, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2012 to mark the fifteenth anniversary since their formation. The fourth compilation album, &quot;Love Songs&quot;, was released on January 29, 2013, and included the newly recorded song &quot;Nuclear&quot;, produced by Pharrell Williams. &quot;Nuclear&quot; marked the first original music from Destiny&#x27;s Child in eight years. The following month, Rowland and Williams appeared as special guests for Knowles&#x27; Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where they performed &quot;Bootylicious&quot;, &quot;Independent Women&quot; and Knowles&#x27; own song &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot;. A video album titled &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Child Video Anthology&quot; was released in May 2013 and featured sixteen of the group&#x27;s music videos. Knowles and Williams were then featured on Rowland&#x27;s song &quot;You Changed&quot; from her fourth solo album &quot;Talk a Good Game&quot; (2013). Later that year, Rowland and Williams made cameo appearances in the music videos for Knowles&#x27; songs &quot;Superpower&quot; and &quot;Grown Woman&quot;, which were both included on her self-titled fifth solo visual album. Williams released the single &quot;Say Yes&quot; in June 2014, featuring Knowles and Rowland. They performed &quot;Say Yes&quot; together during the 2015 Stellar Awards, and the live version of the song was mastered for iTunes in April 2015. On November 7, 2016, the group reunited in a video to try the Mannequin Challenge, which was posted on Rowland&#x27;s official Instagram account. The group reunited for Beyoncé&#x27;s headline performance at Coachella in April 2018; the show was filmed and released as the &quot;Homecoming&quot; documentary and live album.

== Artistry ==
=== Musical style and themes ===
Destiny&#x27;s Child recorded R&amp;B songs with styles that encompass urban, contemporary, and dance-pop. In the group&#x27;s original lineup, Knowles was the lead vocalist, Rowland was the second lead vocalist, Luckett was on soprano, and Roberson was on alto. Knowles remained as the lead vocalist in the group&#x27;s final lineup as a trio, however, Rowland and Williams also took turns in singing lead for the majority of their songs. Destiny&#x27;s Child has cited R&amp;B singer Janet Jackson, En Vogue and TLC as their influences. Ann Powers of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Destiny&#x27;s Child music as &quot;fresh and emotional ... these ladies have the best mixes, the savviest samples and especially the most happening beats.&quot; In the same publication, Jon Pareles noted that the sound that defines Destiny&#x27;s Child, aside from Knowles&#x27; voice, &quot;is the way its melodies jump in and out of double-time. Above brittle, syncopated rhythm tracks, quickly articulated verses alternate with smoother choruses.&quot; The group usually harmonize their vocals in their songs, especially on the ballads. In most instances of their songs, each member sings one verse and chimes in at the chorus. In their third album &quot;Survivor&quot; (2001), each member sings lead in the majority of the songs. Knowles said, &quot;... everybody is a part of the music ... Everybody is singing lead on every song, and it&#x27;s so great—because now Destiny&#x27;s Child is at the point vocally and mentally that it should be at.&quot; Knowles, however, completely led songs like &quot;Brown Eyes&quot; and &quot;Dangerously in Love 2&quot;. The group explored themes of sisterhood and women&#x27;s empowerment in songs such as &quot;Independent Women&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot;, but have also been criticized for the anti-feminist message of songs such as &quot;Cater 2 U&quot; and &quot;Nasty Girl&quot;.

&quot;Survivor&quot; contains themes interpreted by the public as a reference to the group&#x27;s internal conflict. The title track, &quot;Survivor&quot;, which set the theme used throughout the album, features the lyrics &quot;I&#x27;m not gonna blast you on the radio ... I&#x27;m not gonna lie on you or your family ... I&#x27;m not gonna hate you in the magazine&quot; caused Roberson and Luckett to file a lawsuit against the group; the lyrics were perceived to be a violation over their agreement following a settlement in court. In an interview, Knowles commented: &quot;The lyrics to the single &#x27;Survivor&#x27; are Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s story because we&#x27;ve been through a lot, ... We went through our drama with the members ... Any complications we&#x27;ve had in our 10-year period of time have made us closer and tighter and better.&quot; In another song called &quot;Fancy&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;You always tried to compete with me, girl ... find your own identity&quot;, was interpreted by critic David Browne, in his review of the album for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; magazine, as a response to the lawsuit. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic summarized &quot;Survivor&quot; as &quot;a determined, bullheaded record, intent on proving Destiny&#x27;s Child has artistic merit largely because the group survived internal strife. ... It&#x27;s a record that tries to be a bold statement of purpose, but winds up feeling forced and artificial.&quot; Despite the album&#x27;s receiving critical praise, Knowles&#x27; close involvement has occasionally generated criticism. Knowles wrote and co-produced the bulk of &quot;Survivor&quot;. Browne suggested that her help made &quot;Survivor&quot; a &quot;premature, but inevitable, growing pains album&quot;. In the majority of the songs on their final studio album &quot;Destiny Fulfilled&quot; (2004), the verses are divided into three sections, with Knowles singing first, followed by Rowland, then Williams; the three harmonize together during the choruses.

=== Public image ===
Destiny&#x27;s Child were compared to The Supremes, a 1960s American female singing group, with Knowles being compared to Supremes frontwoman Diana Ross; Knowles, however, has dismissed the notion. Coincidentally, Knowles starred in the film adaptation of the 1981 Broadway musical &quot;Dreamgirls&quot; as Deena Jones, the frontwoman of the Dreams, a female singing group based on the Supremes. With Knowles&#x27; wide role assumed in the production of &quot;Survivor&quot;, Gil Kaufman of MTV noted that &quot;it became clear that Beyoncé was emerging as DC&#x27;s unequivocal musical leader and public face&quot;. Her dominance to the creative input in the album made the album &quot;very much her work&quot;. For Lola Ogunnaike of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s been a long-held belief in the music industry that Destiny&#x27;s Child was little more than a launching pad for Beyoncé Knowles&#x27; inevitable solo career.&quot;

In the wake of Knowles&#x27; debut solo album &quot;Dangerously in Love&quot; (2003), rumors spread about a possible split of Destiny&#x27;s Child after each member had experienced solo success and had ongoing projects. Comparisons were drawn to Justin Timberlake, who did not return to band NSYNC after his breakthrough debut solo album, &quot;Justified&quot;. Rowland responded to such rumors, announcing they were back in the studio together. The group claimed that the reunion was destined to happen and that their affinity to each other kept them cohesive. Margeaux Watson, arts editor at &quot;Suede&quot; magazine, suggested that Knowles &quot;does not want to appear disloyal to her former partners,&quot; and called her decision to return to the group &quot;a charitable one&quot;. Knowles&#x27; mother, Tina, wrote a 2002-published book, titled &quot;Destiny&#x27;s Style: Bootylicious Fashion, Beauty and Lifestyle Secrets From Destiny&#x27;s Child&quot;, an account of how fashion influenced Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s success.

== Legacy ==
Destiny&#x27;s Child have been referred to as R&amp;B icons, and have sold more than 60 million records worldwide. Following the disbandment of Destiny&#x27;s Child, MTV&#x27;s James Montgomery noted that &quot;they have left a fairly sizable legacy behind&quot; as &quot;one of the best-selling female pop vocal groups in history.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; observed that Destiny&#x27;s Child were &quot;defined by a combination of feisty female empowerment anthems, killer dance moves and an enviable fashion sense,&quot; while &quot;Essence&quot; noted that they &quot;set trends with their harmonious music and cutting-edge style.&quot; In 2015, Daisy Jones of &quot;Dazed Digital&quot; published an article on how the group made a significant impact in R&amp;B music, writing &quot;Without a hint of rose tint, Destiny&#x27;s Child legitimately transformed the sound of R&amp;B forever... their distinct influence can be found peppered all over today&#x27;s pop landscape, from Tinashe to Ariana Grande.&quot; Nicole Marrow of &quot;The Cut&quot; magazine believed that R&amp;B music in the 1990s and early 2000s &quot;was virtually redefined by the success of powerhouse performers like TLC and Destiny&#x27;s Child, who preached a powerful litany of embracing womanhood and celebrating individuality.&quot; Hugh McIntyre of &quot;Forbes&quot; wrote that before The Pussycat Dolls and Danity Kane burst onto the music scene in the mid-2000s, Destiny&#x27;s Child were &quot;the reigning queens&quot; of the girl group genre.

Writing for Pitchfork, Katherine St. Asaph noticed how Destiny&#x27;s Child defined the revival of girl groups similar to The Supremes in the early-to-mid-&#x27;90s, saying:
There is no better microcosm of what happened to Top 40 music between 1993 and 1999 than this. Bands like the “Star Search” winner were buried in a landfill of post-grunge, while R&amp;B groups built out from soul and quiet storm to create a sound innovative enough to earn the “futuristic” label almost everything got in that pre-Y2K time. This bore itself out in the revival in the early-to-mid-’90s of excellent girl groups vaguely in the Supremes mold—TLC, En Vogue, SWV—but it would be Destiny’s Child who would become their true successors.

Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s final lineup as a trio has been widely noted as the group&#x27;s most recognizable and successful lineup. &quot;Billboard&quot; recognized them as one of the greatest musical trios of all time; they were also ranked as the third most successful girl group of all time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, behind TLC and The Supremes. The group&#x27;s single &quot;Independent Women&quot; (2000) ranked second on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s list of the &quot;Top 40 Biggest Girl Group Songs of All Time on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 Chart&quot;. &quot;Independent Women&quot; was also acknowledged by the &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the longest-running number-one song on the Hot 100 by a girl group. The term &quot;Bootylicious&quot; (a combination of the words booty and delicious) became popularized by Destiny&#x27;s Child&#x27;s single of the same and was later added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2006. The term was also used to describe Beyoncé during the 2000s decade due to her curvaceous figure. VH1 included &quot;Bootylicious&quot; on their &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the &#x27;00s&quot; list in 2011, and Destiny&#x27;s Child on their &quot;100 Greatest Women in Music&quot; list the following year. Additionally, &quot;Independent Women&quot; was ranked as one of &quot;NME&quot;″s &quot;100 Best Songs of the 00s&quot;. Destiny&#x27;s Child was honored at the 2005 World Music Awards with the World&#x27;s Best Selling Female Group of All Time Award, which included a 17-minute tribute performance by Patti LaBelle, Usher, Babyface, Rihanna, Amerie and Teairra Mari. In 2006, the group was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Destiny&#x27;s Child has been credited as a musical influence or inspiration by several artists including Rihanna, Meghan Trainor, Fifth Harmony, Little Mix, Girls Aloud, Haim, Jess Glynne, Katy B, and RichGirl. Ciara was inspired to pursue a career in music after seeing Destiny&#x27;s Child perform on television. Ariana Grande cited Destiny&#x27;s Child as one of her vocal inspirations, saying that listening to the group&#x27;s music is how she discovered her range and &quot;learned about harmonies and runs and ad-libs.&quot; Meghan Trainor stated that her single &quot;No&quot; (2016) was inspired by the late 1990s and early 2000s sounds of Destiny&#x27;s Child, NSYNC, and Britney Spears. Fifth Harmony cited Destiny&#x27;s Child as their biggest inspiration, and even paid tribute to the group by performing a medley of &quot;Say My Name&quot;, &quot;Independent Women&quot;, &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and &quot;Survivor&quot; on the television show &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;. Fifth Harmony also incorporated elements of the intro from &quot;Bootylicious&quot; for the intro to their own song &quot;Brave, Honest, Beautiful&quot; (2015).

<doc id="169412" wikidata="Q172668" url="?curid=169412" title="Fugging, Upper Austria">
<text>Fugging (), spelled Fucking until 2021, is an Austrian village in the municipality of Tarsdorf, located in the Innviertel region of western Upper Austria. It is north of Salzburg and east of the Inn river, which forms part of the German border.

Despite a population of only 106 in 2020, the village has drawn attention in the English-speaking world for its former name, which was spelled the same as an inflected form of the vulgar English-language word &quot;fuck&quot;. Its road signs were a popular visitor attraction and were often stolen by souvenir-hunting vandals until 2005, when they were modified to be theft-resistant. A campaign to change the village&#x27;s name to Fugging was rejected in 2004 but succeeded in late 2020.

== Former name and etymology ==
The settlement is believed to have been founded in the 6th century AD by Focko, a Bavarian nobleman. The Austrian region during this century was mostly under the domain of the Kingdom of the Ostrogoths and was populated by a mix of Christians and pagans. The existence of the village was documented for the first time in 1070, and historical records show that some 20 years later, the lord was recorded in Latin as &quot;&quot;. The spelling of the name, which is pronounced with the English language vowel &quot;oo&quot; as in &quot;book&quot;, evolved over the years; it is first recorded in historical sources as &quot;Vucchingen&quot; in 1070, as &quot;Fukching&quot; in 1303, as &quot;Fugkhing&quot; in 1532, and in the modern spelling &quot;Fucking&quot; in the 18th century. The ending &quot;-&quot; is an old Germanic suffix indicating the people belonging to the root word to which it is attached, thus &quot;Fucking&quot; means &quot;(place of) Focko&#x27;s people&quot;.

== Demographics ==
The Austrian census of 2020 recorded that the village had a population of 106. &quot;The Age&quot; reported in 2005 that it had 104 inhabitants and 32 houses.

== Popularity and notoriety ==
Fugging is best known for the four traffic signs at the entrances to the village, beside which many English-speaking tourists have had their photograph taken because of its former name of &quot;Fucking&quot;. British and United States soldiers based in nearby Salzburg noticed the name after World War II and began to travel to the village to have their photos taken beside the signs. The local residents, the Fuckingers, were bemused, as they had not previously been aware of the meaning of their village&#x27;s name in English. During the second half of the 20th century and the early 21st century, the number of tourists visiting the village increased, including the occasional tour bus.

The village is especially popular with British tourists; as a local tour guide explained: &quot;The Germans all want to see Mozart&#x27;s house in Salzburg; the Americans want to see where &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was filmed; the Japanese want Hitler&#x27;s birthplace in Braunau; but for the British, it&#x27;s all about Fucking.&quot; Augustina Lindlbauer, the manager of an area guesthouse, said that the area had lakes, forests, and vistas worth visiting, but there was an &quot;obsession with Fucking&quot;, and she had to explain to a British tourist &quot;that there were no Fucking postcards&quot;. The English meaning of its name also resulted in the village being the butt of jokes in popular media. &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; featured the village in the 2017 episode &quot;[censored] to [censored]&quot;, as part of a road trip from Wank via Kissing, Petting, and Fucking to Wedding. In 2019, Norwegian broadcasting company NRK Sport produced a comedic tourism video on Fucking. Released on YouTube, the video consists of the reporter and the former &quot;Melodi Grand Prix Junior&quot; presenter Nicolay Ramm both advertising the village&#x27;s attractions and listing off a large number of double entendres based on its name.

The road signs were commonly stolen as souvenirs, and cost some 300 euros to replace. In 2005, theft-resistant welded signs were installed, secured in concrete. The mayor of Tarsdorf said that tourists were still welcome, though the local police chief emphasised that &quot;we will not stand for the Fucking signs being removed. It may be very amusing for you British, but Fucking is simply Fucking to us. What is this big Fucking joke? It is puerile.&quot; One resident set up a website selling T-shirts featuring the signs, with the slogan &quot;I like Fucking in Austria&quot;, but shut it down after other residents disapproved.

In 2009, the village said it would install surveillance cameras to deter tourists from continuing to attempt to steal the road signs. The mayor said that he would prefer not to see the village featured in the press anymore: &quot;Just leave [us] alone&quot;.

In the same year, the European Union&#x27;s Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market trademarks agency forbade a German brewery to market a beer called &quot;Fucking Hell&quot;. The brewery successfully argued that &quot;hell&quot; in German means &quot;pale&quot; and that the beer is produced in Fucking; permission for the name was granted in January 2010. (The second part of the name is the German term for a pale lager, &quot;&quot;.)

== Name change ==
A 2004 vote on changing the village&#x27;s name failed. &quot;Everyone here knows what it means in English, but for us Fucking is Fuckingand it&#x27;s going to stay Fucking&quot; said the mayor as he pointed out that the name had been &quot;Fucking&quot; for 800 years.

In April 2012, rumours spread through international media that villagers had been thinking about changing the name of the village or had actually voted to change it. The satirical website &quot;The Spoof!&quot; published a story that was expanded in the British tabloid the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. The story was then reported elsewhere as news, including by &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, who said that a vote had taken place to change the name to Fugging, but it was discovered that a village with that name already existed in the municipality of Obritzberg-Rust just west of Herzogenburg. The mayor denied these rumours.

The council of Tarsdorf voted in their 17 November 2020 session to have the village&#x27;s name officially changed to Fugging, effective 1 January 2021. A video by Danish YouTuber Albert Dyrlund, which drew attention to the village&#x27;s peculiar name, was reportedly stated as being the reason for the name change. Around 28,673 people visited the village following the release of the video, disrupting local residents with the excessive filming and trespassing of local property such as the village&#x27;s elementary school and residents&#x27; homes. The following month, signs with the new name were vandalised to read &quot;Fucking&quot;. One of the last remaining signs with the old name was given to the in Vienna. In September 2021, village mayor Andrea Holzner stated that the disruptions had ceased, and that the name change had the intended effect.

==In literature and film==
&quot;Bad Fucking&quot;, a 2011 satirical mystery novel by the Austrian director and novelist Kurt Palm, is set in a slightly renamed Fucking; it won the and was filmed in 2013 by Harald Sicheritz.

<doc id="169414" wikidata="Q742804" url="?curid=169414" title="TLC (group)">
<text>TLC is an American girl group formed in 1990 in Atlanta. The group&#x27;s best-known line-up was composed of Tionne &quot;T-Boz&quot; Watkins, Lisa &quot;Left Eye&quot; Lopes, and Rozonda &quot;Chilli&quot; Thomas. The group enjoyed success during the 1990s, with nine top-ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, including four number-one singles: &quot;Creep&quot;, &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, &quot;No Scrubs&quot;, and &quot;Unpretty&quot;. TLC also recorded four multi-platinum albums, including &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; (1994), which received a diamond certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). They became the first R&amp;B group in history to receive the million certification from the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for &quot;FanMail&quot; (1999).

Having sold over 65 million records worldwide, TLC is one of the five best-selling American girl groups of all time. VH1 ranked TLC as the greatest female group, placing them at number 12 on the list of 100 Greatest Women in Music. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine ranked TLC as one of the greatest musical trios, as well as the seventh-most-successful act of the 1990s. The group&#x27;s accolades include four career Grammy Awards, five MTV Video Music Awards, and five Soul Train Music Awards.

Twenty years after their debut, TLC received the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 17th MOBO Awards and the Legend Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan. After Lopes&#x27; death in 2002, instead of replacing her, the remaining members chose to continue as a duo. In 2017, they released their eponymous fifth album &quot;TLC&quot;. In 2022, the group was inducted into the Black Music &amp; Entertainment Walk of Fame.

==History==

===1990–1991: Formation and early years===
Record producer Ian Burke, based in Atlanta, and one of his clients, a teenager Crystal Jones came up with a concept for a girl group with a tomboyish, hip-hop image, similar to the blend of contemporary R&amp;B and hip-hop music of new jack swing act Bell Biv DeVoe in 1990. Jones put out a call for two more girls to join her, eventually answered by Tionne Watkins, a native of Des Moines, Iowa who had moved to Atlanta with her family at a young age, and Lisa Lopes, a rapper who had just moved to the city from her native Philadelphia with a small keyboard and $750 ($ today). The group, then named &quot;2nd Nature&quot;, was formed with Jones, Watkins, and Lopes, who then began working with producers Jermaine Dupri and Rico Wade on demo tape material.

Through a connection at the hair salon where Watkins worked, the group eventually managed to arrange an audition with singer Perri &quot;Pebbles&quot; Reid, who had started her own management and production company, Pebbitone. Impressed by the girls, Reid renamed the group TLC, an initialism for the names Tionne, Lisa, and Crystal. Reid arranged an audition for them with local record label LaFace Records, run by Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds and Reid&#x27;s then-husband, Antonio &quot;L.A.&quot; Reid.

Antonio Reid saw potential in Watkins and Lopes as performers, but felt that Jones should be replaced. According to Jones, things began to unravel for her after Pebbles denied the group the opportunity to take home the contracts that Pebbitone had drafted. Jones did not want to sign before having the contract reviewed by others and perhaps a lawyer. In contrast, Watkins&#x27;s recollection of Jones&#x27;s departure is that both she and Lopes asked Jones to leave the group before their initial contracts were negotiated.

On February 28, 1991, Watkins and Lopes signed production, management, and publishing deals with Pebbitone, with Perri Reid becoming their general manager. As they looked for a replacement for Jones, the two-member TLC made its first recorded appearance on a track for LaFace act Damian Dame&#x27;s self-titled 1991 LP. Pebbles found the third member in Rozonda Thomas, one of Damian Dame&#x27;s part-time backup dancers.

Thomas was signed to the act in April 1991, and to maintain TLC&#x27;s name as an acronym for the girls&#x27; names, Watkins became &quot;T-Boz&quot;, Lopes became &quot;Left-Eye&quot;, and Thomas became &quot;Chilli&quot;. The girls were then signed to LaFace in May through the production deal with Pebbitone; their records would be distributed by Arista Records/BMG. TLC was immediately set up to go into the studio with Reid and Edmonds, Dallas Austin, Jermaine Dupri, and Marley Marl producing their first album. The new trio debuted as backing vocalists on &quot;Rebel (With a Cause)&quot;, a track on Jermaine Jackson&#x27;s sole album for LaFace, &quot;You Said&quot; (1991).

===1991–1994: &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot; and early success===
Their debut album, &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot;, was released on February 25, 1992, by LaFace/Arista Records. The songs on the album are a blend of funk (Watkins), hip-hop (Lopes), and R&amp;B (Thomas), similar to the new jack-swing sound popularized by producer Teddy Riley in the late 1980s. The album was a critical and commercial success, being certified quadruple-platinum for shipments of four million copies in the United States. It scored three top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 with &quot;Ain&#x27;t 2 Proud 2 Beg&quot;, &quot;Baby-Baby-Baby&quot; (peaked at number two), and &quot;What About Your Friends&quot;, as well as the top 30 single &quot;Hat 2 da Back&quot;. Observers coined the term &quot;new jill swing&quot; to describe the album and the group. Later, TLC&#x27;s sound evolved from the genre, but not before opening the door for similar groups such as SWV, Destiny&#x27;s Child, 702, Jade, and the Lopes-produced Blaque.

TLC&#x27;s debut album, chiefly written by Dallas Austin and Lisa Lopes, consisted of playful lyrics, with some female-empowering songs. It was characterized by Watkins&#x27;s contralto vocals, Thomas&#x27;s mezzo-soprano vocals, and Lopes&#x27;s soprano raps. The musical formula was augmented by the girls&#x27; brightly colored videos and peculiar costuming: each girl wore wrapped condoms on their clothing (Lopes also wore one over her left eye in a pair of glasses).

During that period, TLC recorded a song called &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot;, which first appeared on the soundtrack of the film &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot; in 1992. A year later, the song was released as a promotional single and music video for the 1993 holiday season, appearing on the compilation album &quot;A LaFace Family Christmas&quot;. Also in 1993, TLC released a cover version of The Time&#x27;s 1981 hit &quot;Get It Up&quot; as a single from the &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; film soundtrack. During TLC&#x27;s first national tour, as MC Hammer&#x27;s opening act, Lopes and Thomas discovered that Watkins had sickle-cell anemia, a blood disorder which she kept as a closely guarded secret until becoming extremely ill while touring with TLC in the southwest US, ending up hospitalized, with Lopes and Thomas staying with her, resulting in the cancellation of some concerts. Watkins continued to battle her condition and eventually became a spokesperson for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America in the late 1990s.

At the conclusion of the tour, TLC, who had received little monetary compensation up to this point, decided that they no longer wished to employ Pebbles Reid as their manager, in an effort to hold more control over their careers. Reid released the group from its management deal, but they remained signed to Pebbitone, and Reid continued to receive a share of their earnings.

Lopes began dating American football player Andre Rison shortly after the release of &quot;Ooooooohhh... On the TLC Tip&quot;, and by 1994 the two lived together in Rison&#x27;s upscale home. Their relationship was allegedly violent at times, and Lopes filed an assault charge against Rison on September 2, 1993, which Rison denied. Lopes was battling alcoholism at the time, having been a heavy drinker since the age of 15. After another fight between the couple in the early morning hours of June 9, 1994, Lopes tossed numerous pairs of Rison&#x27;s newly purchased shoes into a bathtub, doused them with lighter fluid, and lit them on fire. The fiberglass bathtub quickly melted and set the structural frame of the house on fire. Lopes was arrested and indicted on charges of first-degree arson; she was sentenced to five years of probation and a $10,000 fine. Rison eventually reconciled with Lopes and they continued dating on and off for seven years.

===1993–1996: &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, career height and bankruptcy===

TLC&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot;, saw the group reunited with producers Dallas Austin, Babyface, and Jermaine Dupri, as well as new collaborators Organized Noize, Chucky Thompson, and Sean &quot;Puffy&quot; Combs. Lopes was released from rehab to attend the recording sessions, but the finished album featured significantly less of her raps and vocals. An R&amp;B and hip hop soul album, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; featured hip-hop beats, funk, deep grooves, propulsive rhythms, and smooth production. Released on November 15, 1994, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; was critically acclaimed, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranking it among the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; debuted at number 15. Eventually, it peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spent over two years on the chart. The album sold over 7.7 million copies in the United States alone and received a diamond certification from the RIAA. Worldwide the album sold over 14 million copies.
All four singles from &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; reached the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100—&quot;Creep&quot; and &quot;Waterfalls&quot; reached number one, &quot;Red Light Special&quot; peaked number two, and &quot;Diggin&#x27; on You&quot; reached number five. &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, an Organized Noize-produced song that features an old-school soul-based musical arrangement, socially conscious lyrics criticizing drug dealing and unsafe sex, and an introspective rap from Lopes, became the biggest hit of TLC&#x27;s career. Its million-dollar music video was an MTV staple for many months and made TLC the first black act to win MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year. At the 38th Annual Grammy Awards, TLC took home Best R&amp;B Album and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group for &quot;Creep&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; also crowned TLC as the Artist of the Year at the 1996 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

Amidst their apparent success, the members of TLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on July 3, 1995. TLC said that they had debts totaling $3.5 million, some of it due to Lopes&#x27;s insurance payments arising from the arson incident and Watkins&#x27;s medical bills, but the primary reason being that the group received what they called a less than favorable deal from Pebbitone. After Arista Records, LaFace, and Pebbitone recouped their investment for recording costs and manufacturing and distribution (common recoupable charges in most record contracts), both Pebbitone and LaFace Records went on to charge for expenses such as airline travel, hotels, promotion, music videos, food, clothing, and other expenses. According to the members of TLC, ironically, the more successful the album became, the more they were in debt. In addition to this, managers, lawyers, producers, and taxes had to be paid, leaving each member of the group with less than $50,000 a year after having sold millions upon millions of albums.

TLC sought to renegotiate their 1991 contract with LaFace, under which they received only 56 cents (split three ways) per album sold—considerably less than most major label recording contracts—and received even less than this for each single sold; TLC also wanted to dissolve their association with Pebbitone. LaFace Records refused to renegotiate their deal midway through the contract, thus prompting TLC to file a bankruptcy petition. Both Pebbitone and LaFace countered that TLC &quot;simply&quot; wanted more money and were in no real financial danger, resulting in two years of legal debates before the cases were finally settled in late 1996. TLC&#x27;s contract was renegotiated with LaFace, and Pebbitone agreed to let them out of their production/management deal in exchange for Pebbitone receiving a percentage of royalties on some future releases. By this time, Pebbles had separated from her husband. TLC also bought the rights to the name TLC, which was previously owned by Pebbles.

TLC recorded the theme song to Nickelodeon&#x27;s popular sketch comedy &quot;All That&quot;, which was produced and co-written by Arnold Hennings. The show ran for ten seasons from 1994 to 2005, and was later revived in 2019. The group appeared on the soundtrack album of the Forest Whitaker&#x27;s 1995 film &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; with &quot;This Is How It Works&quot; (a song written by Babyface and Lopes) and was set to re-enter the recording studio the following year after signing a new contract with LaFace and with distribution handled by Arista. Watkins began to release her solo effort with &quot;Touch Myself&quot;, a single from the soundtrack album of 1996 film &quot;Fled&quot;; It reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Lopes also collaborated with fellow female rappers Missy &quot;Misdemeanor&quot; Elliott, Da Brat, and Angie Martinez on Lil&#x27; Kim&#x27;s single &quot;Not Tonight&quot;. It peaked at number six on the Hot 100 and was nominated for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group at the 40th Grammy Awards.

===1997–2000: &quot;FanMail&quot; and members feud===
Preliminary work on TLC&#x27;s third studio album was delayed when friction arose between the group and their main producer Dallas Austin, who was romantically involved with Thomas and had had a child with her in 1997. Austin wanted $4.2 million and creative control to work on the project, resulting in a stand-off between the producer and the artists. During this period, Thomas appeared in the Miramax independent film &quot;Hav Plenty&quot;, while Watkins co-starred with rappers Nas and DMX in Hype Williams&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;Belly&quot;. Lopes started her own production company, Left-Eye Productions, and signed Blaque, an R&amp;B trio. Under her guidance, Blaque released their 1999 self-titled debut album, which was certified platinum and contained two top-ten singles on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Lopes also hosted the short-lived MTV talent series &quot;The Cut&quot; (1998), which featured then-unknown recording artists Ne-Yo and Anastacia.

TLC eventually began working with other producers for their third album, until finally negotiating with Austin, who produced the bulk of the album. Lopes always had an idea of a futuristic feel for the project, which Austin incorporated into the album. Titled &quot;FanMail&quot;, the album was released in February 1999, another critical and commercial success. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified six-time platinum by the RIAA for six million copies shipped in the United States. Worldwide the album exceeded over 10 million copies sold. &quot;No Scrubs&quot; was released as the lead single and became a worldwide hit, topping the singles charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United States. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Unpretty&quot;, incorporated folk and alternative rock influences and became TLC&#x27;s fourth number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The other three singles also received decent radio play: &quot;Silly Ho&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Good at Being Bad&quot;, and Edmonds-written ballad, &quot;Dear Lie&quot;.

At the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;FanMail&quot; received eight nominations, and won three awards: Best R&amp;B Album, Best R&amp;B Song and Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals, the last two for &quot;No Scrubs&quot;. At the Lady of Soul Awards, the group was honored with the Aretha Franklin Entertainer of the Year Award. TLC went on a worldwide tour called the FanMail Tour. The group had a PayPerView special of their tour, which at the time became PayPerView&#x27;s highest-grossing televised special.

During and after the release of &quot;FanMail&quot;, Lopes made it known to the press on multiple occasions that she felt that she was unable to express herself in TLC fully. Her contributions to songs had been reduced to periodic eight-bar raps, and there were several songs in which she had no vocals. Studio session singers such as Debra Killings often sang background vocals for the group&#x27;s songs, something Lopes also wanted to do on songs in which she did not rap. In late 1999, Entertainment Weekly published a letter written by Lopes that challenged her groupmates Watkins and Thomas to all record solo albums and see which album performed the best:

The members eventually settled the feud, and &quot;The Challenge&quot; was never taken up. After the conclusion of the successful &quot;FanMail&quot; tour, they took some time off and pursued personal interests. Lopes was the first to begin recording her solo album, &quot;Supernova&quot;. The album was released in Europe, and the first—and only—single &quot;The Block Party&quot; reached the Top 20 on the UK Singles Chart. The song was released in the United States a few weeks before the scheduled album release. However, when the song did not perform well, the album&#x27;s release was canceled for North America, and no further singles were promoted. In 2000, Spice Girls member Melanie C collaborated with Lopes on the single &quot;Never Be the Same Again&quot;; it became an international hit reaching number one in many countries. On August 1, 2001, the group performed &quot;Waterfalls&quot; at MTV&#x27;s 20th anniversary party in New York City, which would be their final performance as a trio before the death of Lopes.

===2002–2006: Lisa Lopes&#x27; death, &quot;3D&quot; and &quot;R U the Girl&quot;===
After an unsuccessful debut solo album, &quot;Supernova&quot;, Lopes started working on her second solo album, known as &quot;N.I.N.A. (New Identity Non Applicable)&quot;, whilst regrouping with Watkins and Thomas to record raps for TLC&#x27;s fourth album. On April 25, 2002, before both projects were completed, Lopes died in a car crash while filming a documentary in Honduras, which would later be released as &quot;The Last Days of Left Eye&quot; in 2007 on VH1. After taking a two-week hiatus following Lopes&#x27;s death, Watkins, Thomas, and Austin decided that they would complete the remainder of their fourth album, to be called &quot;3D&quot;, which also featured production from Rodney Jerkins, The Neptunes, Raphael Saadiq, Missy Elliott, and Timbaland. They also decided that TLC would go on an indefinite hiatus after the release and promotion of &quot;3D&quot;, rather than replace Lopes and continue as a group. However, they chose to carry on as a duo. Lopes appears vocally on &quot;3D&quot;, as she had already completed her vocals for three songs for the new album, two of which were included on the standard version. Two others feature unused vocals from previously unreleased material, and several of the songs eulogized Lopes. &quot;3D&quot; was released on November 12, 2002.

With its release, &quot;3D&quot; debuted at number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified two times platinum by the RIAA for two million shipped in the United States. It failed to generate success overseas, except for Japan, where it reached number two and achieved platinum from the RIAJ for 200,000 copies sold. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Girl Talk&quot;, peaked at number 28 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, making it their lowest-charting lead single ever. Its music video featured Watkins and Thomas alone in live-action segments and Lopes in animated segments. It was followed by &quot;Hands Up&quot;, which became their first single not to enter the Hot 100 chart (peaking at number seven on the Bubbling Under R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles), and &quot;Damaged&quot;, which reached number 53 on the Hot 100.

In June 2003, a year after the death of Lopes, at &quot;Zootopia&quot;, an annual concert hosted by New York radio station Z100 held at Giants Stadium, TLC appeared in what was announced to be their last performance. The group, introduced by Britney Spears and Carson Daly, showed a video montage dedicated to Lopes and went on to perform songs against video footage of Lopes performing the same songs and wearing the same outfits appearing onstage. Nevertheless, TLC made a comeback in February 2004 as a featured artist on a Japanese charity single titled &quot;VOICE OF LOVE POSSE&quot; with other Japanese artists. In 2003, LaFace released the first TLC&#x27;s greatest hits album titled &quot;Now &amp; Forever: The Hits&quot; with a new song, &quot;Come Get Some&quot;, featuring Lil Jon and Sean P of the YoungBloodZ. However, the compilation was not released in the United States until June 2005. The album debuted at number 53, with 20,000 copies sold.

On June 25, 2004, Watkins and Thomas announced that they were pitching a reality television show that was eventually picked up for development by UPN. Titled &quot;R U the Girl&quot;, the show debuted on July 27, 2005. Despite media speculation that the winner of the series was to become a new, permanent member of TLC, Watkins and Thomas have vowed never to replace Lopes with a new member. The winner of the show, 20-year-old Tiffany &quot;O&#x27;so Krispie&quot; Baker, worked with Watkins and Thomas to record a new song, &quot;I Bet&quot;, and they performed it together during a live concert finale in Atlanta. Roughly 4.1 million viewers tuned in for the season finale of &quot;R U The Girl&quot; on September 20, 2005. &quot;I Bet&quot; was released to radio and iTunes on October 4, 2005, but failed to make it onto the charts. The song later became a bonus track on &quot;Now &amp; Forever: The Hits&quot;.

===2007–2014: Hiatus and biographical television film===

On August 20, 2007, a new greatest hits album was released in the UK called &quot;Crazy Sexy Hits: The Very Best of TLC&quot;. The album fared better than previous compilation &quot;Now &amp; Forever: The Hits&quot;, peaking at number 57 on the UK Albums Chart. Watkins and Thomas made a special appearance at the BET Awards on June 24, 2008. They, along with the original members of En Vogue and SWV, performed in Alicia Keys&#x27;s tribute to girl groups. TLC performed a 13-song set in Japan during the 2009 Springroove music festival on April 4. They also performed their set to the 10,000 audience members at the &quot;Justin Timberlake and Friends&quot; benefit concert, held on October 17, 2009, at the Mandalay Bay Events Center in the Las Vegas Valley, U.S. TLC later performed on the season finale of &quot;American Idol&quot;, which aired on May 25, 2011. On May 21, 2023, they performed again on the show for the first time in 11 years, singing a medley of their hits, including &quot;No Scrubs&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, with contestant Lucy Love.

In 2012, Watkins and Thomas appeared in British pop group Stooshe&#x27;s music video for their cover version of &quot;Waterfalls&quot;. It was later included in &quot;Totally T-Boz&quot;, a docu-series chronicling Watkins&#x27;s move to California, health issues, and solo endeavors. Stooshe later performed &quot;Waterfalls&quot; at the 17th annual MOBO Awards on November 3, 2012, where TLC was honored with Outstanding Contribution to Music. On June 23, 2013, TLC received the Legend Award at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards Japan, at which they also performed a medley of their hit singles. On June 19, 2013, to celebrate their 20th anniversary in the music industry, the group released a Japan-exclusive compilation album titled &quot;TLC 20: 20th Anniversary Hits&quot;, which includes remastered versions of their old songs; as a gift for their Japanese fans, they also recorded a new version of &quot;Waterfalls&quot;, enlisting Japanese singer Namie Amuro to sing Lopes&#x27;s part. The decision to record with Amuro was raised as an issue by Lopes&#x27;s family, who felt &quot;betrayed&quot;, as they were not informed about the vocal replacement. Watkins and Thomas subsequently stated that they had been unable to gain clearance to use Lopes&#x27;s vocals for the new version of the song, but that Lopes would have approved of having Amuro on the track.

TLC was featured on &quot;Crooked Smile&quot;, the second single from American rapper J. Cole&#x27;s 2013 album &quot;Born Sinner&quot;. It peaked at number 27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, giving TLC their first top-40 hit in over a decade. The collaboration won the &quot;Impact Track&quot; award at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards and was nominated for MTV Video Music Award for Best Video with a Social Message at the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards. They also made an appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards, introducing Drake&#x27;s performance. TLC signed a new recording contract with Epic Records and released an American version of the compilation album &quot;20&quot; on October 15, 2013. The album included one new recording, &quot;Meant to Be&quot;, written and produced by Ne-Yo. The song served as the soundtrack for &quot;&quot;, a TLC biographical telefilm, which premiered on VH1 on October 21, 2013. Directed by Charles Stone III, the film starred Keke Palmer as Thomas, Lil Mama as Lopes, and Drew Sidora as Watkins. The film uses the newly rearranged songs from &quot;TLC 20: 20th Anniversary Hits&quot;. The premiere broadcast garnered 4.5 million viewers, a five-year ratings high for VH1. In November 2013, TLC had three albums charting on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, including &quot;20&quot; at number 12, &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; at number 108 and &quot;Now and Forever: The Hits&quot; at number 169.

On November 24, 2013, TLC performed a highly anticipated rendition of &quot;Waterfalls&quot; at the 2013 American Music Awards, with Lil Mama delivering Lopes&#x27;s part, including the rap segment. Subsequently, TLC performed &quot;No Scrubs&quot; with Lil Mama on the &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; television show. In January 2014, TLC appeared at VH1&#x27;s &quot;Super Bowl Concert Series&quot; performing at the Beacon Theatre in New York City. TLC announced the first Australian tour of their career in April 2014, consisting of shows in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, and Perth. The group performed a set of their hits, including visual and vocal representation of Lopes for the performance. On December 12, 2014, TLC released a new Christmas song titled &quot;Gift Wrapped Kiss&quot;.

===2015–present: Comeback tours and self-titled studio album===
On January 19, 2015, TLC announced their plan to release their fifth and final album with the launch of a Kickstarter campaign. They asked fans to help finance the project by donating a pledge of at least $5 to reach their goal of $150,000. In less than 48 hours, they surpassed their goal and become the &quot;fastest most-funded pop project in Kickstarter history&quot;. Among other artists who donated were New Kids on the Block (donating $10,000), Katy Perry (donating $5,000), Soulja Boy, Bette Midler, and Justin Timberlake. The Kickstarter campaign raised a total of $400,000. In an interview published following the end of the campaign, Watkins and Thomas clarified that they would never split up following the release and promotion of the album and that they would continue to perform together as TLC.

In May 2015, TLC embarked on a North American tour with New Kids on the Block and Nelly titled The Main Event Tour. It was their first tour in 15 years since the completion of the Fanmail Tour in 2000. Subsequently, TLC embarked on TLC 2016–17 Tour and I Love the 90s: The Party Continues Tour. During the development of their album, they petitioned Lisa Lopes&#x27;s brother Ron Lopes for assistance with making Left Eye&#x27;s presence on the album a possibility since she had an abundance of unreleased material. However, they ultimately passed on using any of Lopes&#x27;s archive recordings as the available source material conflicted with the sound that they were recording for the album. On October 28, 2016, TLC released two new songs off of the new album called &quot;Joyride&quot; and &quot;Haters&quot; in Japan. The former hit number one on the iTunes R&amp;B chart in Japan. For the first time ever, on December 8, 2016, TLC performed &quot;Sleigh Ride&quot; with surprise guest Missy Elliott along with their latest song &quot;Sunny&quot; on &quot;Taraji&#x27;s White Hot Holidays&quot;, a Fox holiday special hosted by actress Taraji P. Henson.

Their fifth studio album, &quot;TLC&quot;, was released on June 30, 2017. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;Way Back&quot; featuring Snoop Dogg was released April 14 to all major digital music outlets and streaming services, but not to radio. The single was produced by D&#x27;Mile and released via TLC&#x27;s newly formed independent label 852 Musiq, which is distributed through RED Distribution in the US. TLC made its UK Debut at London&#x27;s KOKO on May 9, 2017. Ultimately, &quot;TLC&quot; sold 12,000 copies domestically in the first week.

In July 2019, TLC embarked on the &quot;Whole Lotta Hits Tour,&quot; co-headlining with Nelly and supported by Flo Rida. It was announced in October 2020, that television channel A&amp;E Network had greenlit a brand new two-hour documentary special chronicling the group&#x27;s meteoric rise to the top. Tentatively titled &quot;Biography: TLC&quot;, the documentary was set to be executive produced by Academy Award-winning director Roger Ross Williams and Emmy Award-winning producer Geoff Martz. Directed by Matt Kay, the special was scheduled to premiere on A&amp;E some time in 2021 but was later pushed back to 2022; then 2023. Titled &quot;TLC Forever&quot;, it premiered on Lifetime and A&amp;E, on June 2, 2023.

In June 2021, it was announced that TLC would embark on &quot;Celebration of CrazySexyCool,&quot; an 18-city concert tour of the United States to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their blockbuster sophomore album &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; which was certified 12× platinum by the RIAA in October 2019. The tour, which included Bone Thugs-n-Harmony as an opening act and other surprise guests, began on September 3, 2021, in Albertville, Alabama. In March 2022, it was announced TLC would be playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June. On March 13, 2023, it was announced that TLC would join Shaggy on the &quot;Hot Summer Nights&quot; tour with special guests En Vogue and Sean Kingston; the tour began on June 1.

==Legacy==
&quot;Vibe&quot; believed that there would be no &quot;all-Black female R&amp;B group having a chemistry, cultural and commercial impact as remotely comparable as TLC&quot; and dubbed CrazySexyCool as &quot;the blueprint for female ensembles to follow&quot;. The &quot;Philippine Daily Inquirer&quot; called TLC &quot;the most influential female group the world has ever seen&quot;. Beyoncé, who was the lead singer of Destiny&#x27;s Child, said that &quot;TLC has influenced just about every female group that&#x27;s out there now, and they definitely influenced Destiny&#x27;s Child.&quot; Craig JC from &quot;Clutch&quot; wrote that TLC was &quot;big and influential&quot; during the 1990s and that their contemporaries such as SWV, Total, Blaque, 3LW, Brownstone, 702, Jade, Xscape and En Vogue did not have TLC&#x27;s crossover appeal. David A. Keeps from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained the impact of TLC:

&quot;TLC&#x27;s career has been filled with both hits and headlines. The group was one of the few R&amp;B acts to build a strong identity out of its initial success, and they exerted more control over each successive record. Their music—particularly the 11-million-selling &quot;CrazySexyCool&quot; and the 6-million-selling &quot;FanMail&quot;, both of which won two Grammys each—set the standard for contemporary R&amp;B. TLC helped to pioneer a deft blend of acoustic and computer sounds that paved the way for groups like Destiny&#x27;s Child, as did their image as independent women. Whether addressing AIDS in &#x27;Waterfalls&#x27; or the struggle for female self-esteem in &#x27;Unpretty&#x27;, they showed themselves able to take serious issues to the top of the pop charts.&quot;

TLC is the best-selling American girl group since the Supremes, with 65 million records sold worldwide. According to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), TLC has 23 million certified album sales. TLC and the Chicks, a country band, are the only two female ensembles to receive the RIAA diamond award, which indicates sales of 10,000,000 copies. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, TLC is the second most successful girl group on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, behind the Supremes.

<doc id="169415" wikidata="Q7425068" url="?curid=169415" title="Sasha &amp; John Digweed">
<text>Sasha &amp; John Digweed are a British DJ duo comprising Sasha and John Digweed. Digweed had been DJing for ten years before getting a gig at Renaissance where he met Sasha, who had been working the past few years in various acid house music clubs and raves. Together, they honed their DJ skills, focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. In 1994, they released the triple CD mix album &quot;&quot; on Renaissance Records. It contained many popular dance hits of the time from artists such as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice as well as original productions and remixes from themselves. Two years later, the duo became &quot;true superstars&quot; (AllMusic) with the release of their double CD &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; on mega-label Ministry of Sound. This release was brought to the United States the next year in a single CD package on Ultra Records. 1997 saw the release of the &quot;Northern Exposure 2&quot; double CD mix album, again on Ministry of Sound. Sasha and Digweed toured internationally, helping define the sound of progressive house &amp; trance music in the late 1990s. In 1998, both John Digweed and Sasha released separate mix albums on Boxed as part of the Global Underground series with Digweed&#x27;s GU 006: Sydney and Sasha&#x27;s GU 009: San Francisco release.

In the late 1990s, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City&#x27;s famous Twilo nightclub as well as releasing their third edition in the Northern Exposure series: &quot;Northern Exposure: Expeditions&quot;. They both continued their success in the Global Underground series with Digweed&#x27;s GU 014: Hong Kong and Sasha&#x27;s GU 013: Ibiza. In addition to their residency, they toured the United States, especially to promote their DJ mix &quot;Communicate&quot; in 2000. Shortly thereafter, they embarked on their international Delta Heavy Tour in 2002. They have collaborated little since Delta Heavy. They appeared together at the 2007 Bonnaroo Music Festival, and counted down the new year during a four-hour set in Los Angeles at Together As One.

In 2008, Sasha &amp; Digweed announced their plans to do another tour of North America taking in 21 cities in one month, as they announced the Sasha and John Digweed Spring Club Tour 2008. The tour began at the Winter Music Conference on 27 March at the club Mansion. This was the first time they toured North America together in six years.

In 2009, Sasha &amp; Digweed headlined the SW4 festival in London&#x27;s Clapham Common.

==History==

===Early years and &quot;Renaissance&quot; (1993–1995)===
In early 1993, Renaissance DJs Sasha and John Digweed teamed up for DJ sets together. The pair had honed their DJing skills, often performing in tandem and focusing on track selection and technical mixing abilities. Renaissance was pleased with their performances together. Renaissance decided to let the duo compile the triple mix album, entitled &quot;Renaissance - The Mix Collection&quot;, releasing it on the club&#x27;s own Renaissance Records label in April 1994, by which point Sasha had already left Renaissance. Sasha had been featured on the cover of &quot;Mixmag&quot; with the tagline &quot;SON OF GOD?&quot;, though he did not welcome the accolade. The album featured tracks from such artists as Leftfield, Fluke, and 2 Bad Mice, and original productions and remixes from Sasha and Digweed, and was successful in the UK Compilation Chart where it peaked at #9. Another album, &quot;Renaissance: The Mix Collection Part 2&quot;, acting as the second part to &quot;Renaissance: The Mix Collection&quot;, was released in 1995. As Sasha had left Renaissance, John Digweed mixed this album alone.

===&quot;Northern Exposure&quot; (1996–2000)===
After touring together for a further two years, the duo became &quot;true superstars&quot; with the release of their next mix album, the double &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; on the Ministry of Sound&#x27;s record label. The album was designed as a concept album of two &quot;journeys&quot;, disc one being &quot;0° North&quot; and the second, &quot;0° South&quot;. A special unmixed version of the album with a highly altered track list was released on vinyl. The album was critically acclaimed and is generally considered a landmark in the history of progressive house.
In 1997, the duo worked on a follow-up to &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;, again following the concept album theme, with one disc representing the West Coast and the other disc the East Coast. It was released in 1997 on the Ministry of Sound label as &quot;Northern Exposure 2&quot;. The album only charted at #15 in the UK Compilation Chart but it was again a critical success. To support the album, the duo toured internationally, and in the process helped to define the sound of trance music in the late 1990s. After extensive touring, Digweed and Sasha took up residency at New York City&#x27;s famous Twilo nightclub, where they would DJ for the entire night. In 1998, the two released separate mix albums on the Boxed label, as part of the Global Underground series: Digweed&#x27;s &quot;Global Underground 006: Sydney&quot;, and Sasha&#x27;s &quot;Global Underground 009: San Francisco&quot;, which drew from Sasha&#x27;s experience touring on the West Coast of the United States. Both DJs formed their own record labels that year: Sasha created Excession Records and Digweed started Bedrock Records. Excession released fewer than ten records, the last in 1998; the experience, however, led Sasha to found the management agency &quot;Excession: The Agency LTD.&quot; Excession remains a booking agency for many DJs, including Hybrid, Nick Warren, and Steve Lawler.

In 1998, Sasha and Digweed reunited in the studio to record their third and final album for the &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; series, &quot;Northern Exposure: Expeditions&quot;, which saw the duo voyage into exploring vocal trance. Popular with critics, it charted better in the UK Compilations Chart than their previous albums, the CD version charting at #6 (the vinyl edition of the album, largely different from the CD version, charted at #37).

===&quot;Communicate&quot; (2000–2001)===
In between touring and producing original material, Sasha and Digweed released the mix album &quot;Communicate&quot; in 2000, prompting them to temporarily leave their Twilo residency for a promotional tour of the United States. &quot;Communicate&quot; had reasonable commercial success, but it received mixed reviews: &quot;Spin&quot; stated that despite a &quot;few stellar moments, [&quot;Communicate&quot;] is ultimately a let-down&quot;. LAUNCHcast, too, described &quot;Communicate&quot; as &quot;boring and lackluster...stalled in a monochrome world of dead beats&quot;. To promote the album, the duo toured the United States.

During the late 1990s, the increased popularity and visibility of &quot;superstar DJs&quot; led to the creation of superclubs such as Liverpool&#x27;s Cream and Sheffield&#x27;s Gatecrasher. By 2003, however, electronic dance music clubs languished. Though dance music had been declared &quot;dead&quot; by many in the dance industry, Sasha continued to tour—despite the closing of many superclubs, including his resident club Twilo in May 2001. Sasha was unable to play their last gigs at Twilo due to an ear injury, leaving Digweed to perform alone.

===&quot;Delta Heavy&quot; tour and hiatus (2002–2006)===
Sasha and Digweed began their ambitious Delta Heavy Tour of the United States in 2002, following the closing of Twilo. The tour featured veteran tour producer Kevin Lyman and opening act Jimmy Van M, the tour covered 31 cities and played to 85,000 people. Sasha and Digweed performed at Water Street Music Hall in Rochester, New York in April 2002. The appearances were complete with laser shows and video production, were similar to rock concerts than to typical DJ events. This motif was new to the DJing scene, and compelled other DJs to host similar concerts.
2004 marked the tenth anniversary of &quot;&quot;, which had been out of print for years prior. Sasha and Digweed decided to release an anniversary edition of the album. However, rather than re-release the album straight forward, they recreated the album in a brand new session. Two tracks by M People that featured on the original 1994 release had to be dropped due to licensing issues, so they were replaced by a track each by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark and Anthony White respectively. Though the original blend sequences from the original album remained the same, Sasha and Digweed re-created the album using Apple G4 laptops in order to create, what they considered, a better quality version of the original mix, with recording techniques simply not available in 1994, as well as the advantage of crystal clear audio, and spatial separation of frequencies within the song, making it sound more dynamic.

The duo&#x27;s next release was based on &quot;Delta Heavy&quot;. The release was a Region 1 DVD of performance highlights, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage, &quot;Sasha &amp; John Digweed present Delta Heavy&quot;, released on System Recordings. Ben Turner, creator of the DanceStar awards, retrospectively described the Delta Heavy tour as &quot;a landmark moment for electronic music&quot;.

Though the duo of Sasha and Digweed never explicitly split up, demanding schedules and frequent independent touring prevented any substantial collaboration for a long period after Delta Heavy.

===Reunion (2006–present)===
Though frequent performing and other activities prevented them from working together for several years, Sasha and Digweed announced that they would reunite for a few Australian performances, starting in November 2006. The duo performed at several venues, including Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne as well as numerous tour dates which had followed throughout 2007. In 2008, Sasha and Digweed started an American tour with a performance at the Winter Music Conference. The duo played at mainly larger venues on the weekends and smaller (750-1000 people) shows on weekdays. Sasha described their music as &quot;driving and dark&quot; with &quot;a little throwback of Twilo sounds&quot;. They appeared together at the 2007 Bonnaroo Music Festival, and counted down the new year during a 4-hour set in Los Angeles at Together As One. Another extensive hiatus as a live duo took place after the 2010 WMC Miami Boat Cruise set. After a surprise b2b performance on Easter of 2016, Sasha and Digweed confirmed via Twitter that a world tour was in the works beginning in September which commenced on 9 September at the Social Festival in Kent, UK. They have toured intermittently and extensively on a global scale together since.

<doc id="169419" wikidata="Q6822966" url="?curid=169419" title="Metamagical Themas">
<text>Metamagical Themas is an eclectic collection of articles that Douglas Hofstadter wrote for the popular science magazine &quot;Scientific American&quot; during the early 1980s. The anthology was published in 1985 by Basic Books.

The volume is substantial in size and contains extensive notes concerning responses to the articles and other information relevant to their content. (One of the notes—page 65—suggested memetics for the study of memes.)

==Contents==
Major themes of the columns include self-reference in memes, language, art and logic; discussions of philosophical issues important in cognitive science/AI; analogies and what makes something similar to something else (specifically what makes, for example, an uppercase letter &#x27;A&#x27; recognizable as such); and lengthy discussions of the work of Robert Axelrod on the prisoner&#x27;s dilemma, as well as the idea of superrationality.

The concept of superrationality, and its relevance to the Cold War, environmental issues and such, is accompanied by notes on experiments conducted by the author at the time. Another notable feature is the inclusion of two dialogues in the style of those appearing in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;. Ambigrams are mentioned.

There are three articles centered on the Lisp programming language, in which Hofstadter first details the language itself, and then shows how it relates to Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem. Two articles are devoted to Rubik&#x27;s Cube and similar puzzles. Many chapters open with an illustration of an extremely abstract alphabet, yet one which is still gestaltly recognizable as such.

The game of Nomic was first introduced to the public in this column, in June 1982, when excerpts from a book (still unpublished at the time) by the game&#x27;s creator Peter Suber were printed and discussed.

The index of the book mentions Hofstadter&#x27;s recurring alter ego, Egbert B. Gebstadter.

==List of Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; columns==
From January 1957 through December 1980, Martin Gardner&#x27;s &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column was a monthly feature in &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine. In 1981, Gardner&#x27;s column alternated with a new column by Hofstadter called &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; (an anagram of &quot;Mathematical Games&quot;). Then Hofstadter&#x27;s column appeared monthly from January 1982 through July 1983.
==French edition==

&quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; was also published in French, under the title &quot;Ma Thémagie&quot; (InterEditions, 1988), the translators being Jean-Baptiste Berthelin, Jean-Luc Bonnetain, and Lise Rosenbaum.

The wordplay was lost in the French title, and replaced with another one (&quot;ma Thémagie&quot; would translate to &quot;my themagy&quot;, where &quot;themagy&quot; is a neologism, but could also be read as &quot;maths et magie&quot;, which translates to &quot;maths and magic&quot;). The translators had contemplated &quot;Le matin des métamagiciens&quot;, which would have been a play on Hofstadter&#x27;s title plus &quot;Le Matin des Magiciens&quot; and &quot;Jeux malins des mathématiciens&quot; (respectively, &quot;The Dawn of the Magicians&quot; and &quot;Clever Tricks of Mathematicians&quot;); however, the publisher found that suggestion to be too elaborate.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #88, and stated that &quot;a heady mixture of computers, art, mathematics, philosophy, jokes and above all games.&quot;

<doc id="169425" wikidata="Q665979" url="?curid=169425" title="Reel Big Fish">
<text>Reel Big Fish is an American ska punk band from Huntington Beach, California. The band gained mainstream recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s during the third wave of ska with the release of the gold-certified album &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot;. Soon after, the band lost mainstream recognition but gained an underground cult following. As of 2006, the band was no longer signed to a major record label and has since been independent. After numerous line-up changes, frontman Aaron Barrett is the last remaining founding member still performing in the band.

==History==
===1991–2001: Early success===
The band formed in 1991 while the members were in high school. The group started as a cover band until they released a demo in 1992, titled &quot;In The Good Old Days&quot;. With the departure of Ben Guzman soon after, then backup vocalist Aaron Barrett took his place as lead singer. The band then changed its genre to ska.

Reel Big Fish&#x27;s self-released debut album, &quot;Everything Sucks&quot;, was successful and became an underground hit spread by word-of-mouth, which led to the band signing a deal with Mojo Records. In August 1996, the band released the album &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot; on the new label, which appealed to fans of ska punk style, and the band began touring throughout the United States. After the single &quot;Sell Out&quot; became well known in mainstream venues, including MTV, the album peaked at number 57 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, staying on the charts for 32 weeks. However, the ska revival was short-lived, and the group&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Why Do They Rock So Hard?&quot; failed to match the sales of the band&#x27;s previous record. In 1998, the band appeared in the movie &quot;BASEketball&quot;, performing in the stands to rouse the crowd. The band also appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack with a cover of A-ha&#x27;s &quot;Take On Me&quot;. &quot;Why Do They Rock So Hard?&quot; was the last album for two members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry was fired for his conduct, culminating with him committing battery on a security guard at Mississippi Nights during a concert in St. Louis, and drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family.

===2001–2006: Major label years===
Trumpet player Tavis Werts left the band in 2001. Former Suburban Rhythm drummer Carlos de la Garza and former Spring Heeled Jack trumpeter Tyler Jones, who tracked for two songs on &quot;Cheer Up!&quot; (because Werts had already recorded the majority of his trumpet parts before his departure), were brought in. De la Garza&#x27;s last concert with Reel Big Fish was on June 20, 2003, at the House of Blues in Anaheim, California. That concert was later released as a DVD in &quot;The Show Must Go Off!&quot; series. Jones appeared in the music videos for &quot;Where Have You Been?&quot; and &quot;Monkey Man&quot; (although neither featured any trumpet-playing), and continued to play live with the band until September 2004. Jones was replaced by trumpeter John Christianson, who had previously played with Barrett in the band, The Forces of Evil.

On April 5, 2005, the band released its fourth album on Mojo, &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot;. Justin Ferreira (who replaced De La Garza) was on drums for the recording, but left before the album&#x27;s release to join the Orange County band Takota and subsequently is listed as an additional musician on the CD. He was replaced by Ryland Steen.

Compared to the previous album (&quot;Cheer Up!&quot;), which was more lighthearted and cheerful, Allmusic describes the songs in &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot; as &quot;angry&quot; and &quot;embittered&quot;, but also deemed the album as &quot;super catchy&quot;. Common themes expressed throughout the songs include jealousy, regret, short-lasting fame, and disappointment toward mainstream record companies.

Aaron Barrett has stated that &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot; was &quot;the third record in a trilogy&quot; that began with &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot;. &quot;The first one was about being in a band and trying to make it. Then &quot;Why Do They Rock So Hard?&quot; was like, &#x27;we&#x27;ve made it, we&#x27;re rock stars&#x27;. &quot;Cheer Up&quot; we made because we had to make it. But &quot;We&#x27;re Not Happy &#x27;Til You&#x27;re Not Happy&quot; is about us being old and jaded now.&quot;

===2006–present: Independent work===
While on tour in early 2006, Reel Big Fish were dropped from the Jive Records label. The band formed its own label and released a 3-disc live performance CD/DVD set, &quot;Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album&quot;. This package became available on July 18, 2006, on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22. Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album, &quot;Greatest Hit...And More&quot;.

On February 20, 2007, the band released &quot;Duet All Night Long&quot;, which is a split EP with power pop punk band &quot;Zolof the Rock &amp; Roll Destroyer&quot;. It features six cover songs (three from each band), with the two vocalists performing with both bands. The song, &quot;Say Say Say&quot; features Scott Klopfenstein on vocals in place of Barrett.

The band released its first studio album since leaving Jive Records; &quot;Monkeys for Nothin&#x27; and the Chimps for Free&quot; worldwide on July 10, 2007, on the Rock Ridge Music record label. On June 26, 2007, shortly before its release, the band announced in a Myspace blog that Matt Wong was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn child. He was replaced by Derek Gibbs who played bass in Jeffries Fan Club and Aaron Barrett&#x27;s now defunct side project, The Forces Of Evil. Since Matt Wong was very popular with fans, some were skeptical of the new bassist&#x27;s ability, but the band has stated that Derek Gibbs is &quot;Matt Wong Approved&quot; therefore extinguishing several fans&#x27; worries. Gibbs had been filling in for Wong on various tours since early 2002.

On December 19, 2007, the band announced that it would play the entire Warped Tour 2008.

Reel Big Fish released a new studio album on January 20, 2009. The name of the album is &quot;Fame, Fortune and Fornication&quot;, and it consists of 10 cover songs. Another album, &quot;A Best of Us for the Rest of Us&quot;, featuring a 22-track disc of re-recorded songs and a 14-track disc of &quot;Skacoustic&quot; versions produced by lead singer Aaron Barrett, was released on July 20, 2010. An extended version of the album, A Best of Us for the Rest of Us (Bigger Better Bonus Deluxe Version), was released on June 21, 2011. The group also intended to work on a new album, recording new songs in the fall of 2010. The band has also recorded a live DVD at The Grove in Anaheim, California, on January 4, 2009; which was released on July 21, 2009, with the title &quot;Reel Big Fish Live! In Concert!&quot; In an interview with &#x27;The Examiner&#x27;, Aaron Barrett stated that he planned on releasing a new album, with all new material, in late 2011.

On January 11, 2011, the band announced that longtime member Scott Klopfenstein would be leaving the band to focus on raising a family. Matt Appleton of Goldfinger began filling in for Scott on the band&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Tour, and he has since been announced as a permanent replacement. This marks the first time since 1995 that the band has had a saxophone player.

In March 2012, Reel Big Fish announced via Facebook that the group had begun recording a new album of new, original songs. The album is titled &quot;Candy Coated Fury&quot;, though the band also considered &quot;Honk If You&#x27;re Horny&quot; as a title. The album was released on July 31, 2012.

On October 21, 2013, the band announced via its website that long-time trombonist Dan Regan, who has played with Reel Big Fish since 1994, will depart from the band to spend more time with his family and follow his dream of starting a brewery.

Reel Big Fish announced a co-headline UK and Ireland tour with Less than Jake with support from Zebrahead in early 2014.

In November 2014, Reel Big Fish announced on Facebook that the group would release an EP titled &quot;Happy Skalidays&quot; scheduling release on December 15, 2014.

In February 2015, the band announced through its website that drummer Ryland Steen had gone on hiatus from the band in order to play drums in America. Since the summer of 2014, Edward Beach (née Larsen) of Suburban Legends has been filling in.

On October 9, 2018, through their Instagram page, the band announced a new single called &quot;You Can&#x27;t Have All of Me&quot;, released on October 12. They also confirmed the title for the new album to be &quot;Life Sucks...Let&#x27;s Dance!&quot; and a December release.

On April 11, 2019, Billy Kottage announced that he had quit the band via his Instagram page. Kottage has since toured as a featured musician with The Interrupters. Brian Robertson of Suburban Legends played with the band from June 2019 until their touring hiatus starting in 2020.

On March 22, 2020, former trumpet player Tyler Jones died; the band paid its respects via social media.

On October 28, 2021, former member Scott Klopfenstein reunited with Aaron Barrett to sing on a track by Lo(u)ser titled No Hope. Former drummer Ryland Steen played drums and produced, and Dan Regan also appeared in the music video alongside the others.

In July 2024, Ice Nine Kills released a cover of &quot;Walking On Sunshine&quot; in collaboration with Reel Big Fish, featuring Dan Regan as a credited band member for the first time since 2013.

<doc id="169438" wikidata="Q4006223" url="?curid=169438" title="Up Front (game)">
<text>Up Front is a World War II card-based wargame. It was designed by Courtney F. Allen and published by Avalon Hill in 1983. Hasbro now owns the franchise, and at one time licensed it to Multi-Man Publishing, a license that has since expired without republication of the game. There was an attempt to reprint &quot;Up Front&quot; through Kickstarter in 2013. The project raised over $300,000, but no updates to status has been posted since March 21, 2014.

In 2016 Hasbro licensed Wargame Vault to sell Up Front as a print on demand product; and the game is now available through on-line ordering. The official rules are currently available to order either as a printed book or as a portable document format electronic file. The components (cards) are produced on high quality card-stock with all known official errata incorporated in the reprints.

==Description==

Subtitled &quot;The Squad Leader Card Game&quot;, &quot;Up Front&quot; was intended as a card version of their successful &quot;Squad Leader&quot; series of games, but it represented a radical change in approach. Traditional wargames are based on maps representing terrain and game pieces representing units, which attack on their players&#x27; turns. &quot;Up Front&quot; has terrain, attack opportunities, and other factors determined by cards dealt to the players.

Fans of the game claim this type of play gives the player a more realistic feel for man-to-man combat where most terrain will be unfamiliar. With traditional map-based wargames, players have an overhead view of the entire battlefield. In &quot;Up Front&quot;, locations are revealed as the game is played, emulating how real soldiers might encounter and explore terrain.

The game contains two different kinds of cards, Personality and Action. A Personality card depicts a single soldier and several statistics about him including his name, rank, and the weapon he is carrying. These are assigned by the scenario selected (scenarios lettered A-L were included in the base game) and arranged in groups by the players. The Action Deck contains different types of cards including terrain, movement, heroes, and many other game factors. These are shuffled and dealt to the players.

The original game included German, U.S., and Russian units along with their equipment. Expansions added to the nationalities available for play. Each nationality was given different capabilities including variations in hand size and discard ability which imposes different tactics for the players by limiting the options available to them.

== Expansions ==
Two official expansions were released for &quot;Up Front&quot;:
* &quot;Banzai&quot; (1984), which included Japanese, British, and USMC forces along with rules for Jungle Terrain, Random Reinforcements, and Scenarios M-X.
* &quot;Desert War&quot; (1985), which included French, and Italian forces as well as rules for Desert Terrain.

Both expansions are now available as print to order products from Wargame Vault.

==Reception==
Sandy Petersen comments: &quot;If you can find a copy of &quot;Up Front&quot;, and you like tactical combat at all, check it out. Or even if you just like card games. In either case, you won&#x27;t be disappointed. This is a game that surpasses its flaws, and turns some of them into strengths.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Like many Avalon Hill games, &quot;Up Front&quot; continues to be popular among loyal fans. There are active groups dedicated to the game on the Internet.

There is also a VASSAL Engine module for this game.

Wargame Vault now sells licensed copies of the original game and both expansions as print to order products.

<text>The Holsten Gate (Low German and German: &quot;Holstentor&quot;) is a city gate marking off the western boundary of the old center of the Hanseatic city of Lübeck. Built in 1464, the Brick Gothic construction is one of the relics of Lübeck&#x27;s medieval city fortifications and one of two remaining city gates, the other being the Citadel Gate (&quot;Burgtor&quot;). Known for its two-round towers and arched entrance, it is regarded today as a symbol of the city. Together with the old city centre (Altstadt) of Lübeck it has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1987.

== Appearance ==

The Holsten Gate is composed of a south tower, a north tower and a central building. It has four floors, except for the ground floor of the central block, where the gate&#x27;s passageway is located. The side facing west (away from the city) is called the &quot;field side&quot;, the side facing the city the &quot;city side&quot;. The two towers and the central block appear as one construction when viewed from the city side. On the field side, the three units can be clearly differentiated. Here the two towers form semicircles which at their widest point extend 3.5 metres beyond the central block. The towers have conical roofs; the central block has a pediment.

=== Passageway and inscriptions ===

The passageway once had two gates on the field side, which have not survived. A portcullis installed in 1934 does not correspond to the original security installations. Instead, there was once a so-called &quot;pipe organ&quot; at this location, with individual bars which could be lowered separately rather than together as a set. Thus it was possible to first lower all but one or two rods, leaving a small gap for their own men to slip through later. There is an inscription over the passageway on both the city side and the field side.

On the city side it reads, &quot;SPQL&quot; and is framed by the years 1477 and 1871, the former being the supposed date of construction (the correct date is, however, now known to be 1478), the latter being the date of the gate&#x27;s restoration and the founding of the German Reich. This inscription was modeled on the Roman &quot;SPQR&quot; (Latin &quot;Senatus populusque Romanus&quot; - the Senate and People of Rome) and stands for &quot;Senatus populusque Lubecensis&quot;. It was, however, affixed only in 1871. There was previously no inscription at this location. It would also have been pointless, since the view of the lower parts of the Holsten Gate from the city side was obscured by high walls.

There is another inscription on the field side. The text is &quot;concordia domi foris pax&quot; (&quot;harmony within, peace outside&quot;). This inscription is also from 1871 and is a shortened form of the text which had previously been on the (not preserved) foregate: &quot;Concordia domi et pax foris sane res est omnium pulcherrima&quot; (&quot;Harmony within and peace outside are indeed the greatest good of all&quot;; see &quot;Outer Holsten Gate&quot; below).

=== Fortifications on the field side ===
Functionally, the field and the city side have very different designs. While the city side is richly decorated with windows, this would be inappropriate on the field side considering the possibility of combat situations. On the field side there are accordingly only a few small windows. In addition, the walls are interspersed with embrasures. Also, the wall thickness on the field side is greater than on the city side: 3.5 metres compared to less than 1 metre. The reasoning during construction may have been to be able to quickly destroy the gate from the city side in an emergency, so that it would not fall into enemy hands as a bulwark.

The loopholes and the openings of the gun chambers are directed toward the field side. In each tower there were three gun chambers, one each on the ground, first and second floors. Those on the ground floor have not been preserved. Since the building has subsided over the centuries, they are now 50 centimetres below ground level, and even below the new flooring. On the first upper storey there are, in addition to the aforementioned chambers, two slits for small guns which were above and between the three chambers. There are also small openings on the third upper storey with forward- and downward-directed slits for firing small arms.

The central block has no loopholes. The windows above the passage were also designed for dousing invaders with pitch or boiling water.

=== Ornamentation ===
The most striking nonfunctional embellishments are two so-called &quot;terracotta&quot; stripes which encircle the building. These consist of individual tiles, most of which are square with sides of 55 centimetres. Each tile bears one of three different ornaments: either an arrangement of four heraldic lilies, a symmetrical lattice, or a representation of four thistle leaves. There is no apparent order to these recurring symbols, but each group of eight tiles is always followed by a tile with a different design. It has the form of a heraldic shield and bears either the Lübeck heraldic eagle or a stylized tree. These shields are flanked by two male figures who function as bearers of a coat of arms.

The terracotta stripes were repaired during restoration work between 1865 and 1870. Only three of the original tiles are preserved as museum specimens. The new tiles approximate the former design, although liberties were taken during the restoration. For example, the design of the heraldic eagle motif is by no means a reflection of the original.

The pediment was also not faithfully restored, but this is not the fault of the restorers, since in the 19th century it had long been gone and its original appearance was unknown. An old view on an altarpiece in the Lübeck fortress monastery shows a Holsten Gate with five pediment towers. But since this picture shows the Holstentor Gate in the middle of a fantasy landscape of mountains and forests the credibility of the representation is disputed. Today, three towers crown the pediment, but they are visible only from the city side.

It was constructed with red bricks.

=== Interior ===
Both tower interiors have the same design. The ground floor and first upper story have the highest ceilings, while the floors above are much lower. Two narrow spiral staircases wind their way upwards, in each case between the central building and the adjacent tower. On each floor corridors connect the rooms of the central block with tower rooms at the same level. The ceiling of the north tower&#x27;s second floor has been removed, so that today the second and third upper storeys there share a common space. This change dates from 1934 and does not reflect the original situation.

The gun chambers are in front of the loopholes. Today there are guns in the chambers of the second floor, but they are not originals and were placed there at a late date. Above the gun chambers are hooks from which chains were suspended and attached to the cannon to cushion the recoil after firing. The higher gun chambers of the first upper storey could only be accessed with ladders.

== History ==
The rich Hanseatic city of Lübeck felt the need in the course of the centuries to protect itself from outside threats with ever stronger walls and fortifications. Three gates gave access to the city: the Citadel Gate in the north, Mill Gate in the south, and the Holsten Gate in the west. To the east, the city was protected by the dammed Wakenitz River. Here, the less martial Hüxter Gate led out of the city.

These city gates were initially simple gates which were repeatedly strengthened over time so that they eventually all had an outer, middle and inner gate. Today, only fragments remain of these ancient city gates. The gate now known as the Citadel Gate is the former Interior Citadel Gate; the Middle and Outer Citadel Gates no longer exist. All three Mill Gates have completely disappeared. The gate now known as the Holsten Gate is the former Middle Holsten Gate; there was also an (older) Inner Holsten Gate, an Outer Holsten Gate, and even a fourth gate, known as the Second Outer Holsten Gate. So the history of the Holsten Gate is actually the history of four consecutive gates, although only one of them is left.

The names of the individual gates changed as a matter of course as their components emerged and disappeared. The Middle Holsten Gate was once the Outer Holsten Gate before the gates on either side were constructed. Still today there is a great deal of confusion about the names as one studies the historical record. The four gates and their history are described below.

=== Inner Holsten Gate ===
The oldest Holsten Gate guarded the nearby banks of the Trave River. One had to leave the city through this gate in order to get to the Holsten Bridge, which crossed the river. It is not known when a gate was erected here for the first time. The Holsten Bridge was first mentioned in a 1216 deed signed by the king of Denmark. It is likely that already at that time there was a gate and a city wall along the Trave River. The designations &quot;Holsten Bridge&quot; (and &quot;Holsten Gate&quot;) are simply a consequence of the fact that the city&#x27;s western exit was in the direction of Holstein.

Historical records indicate that the Holsten Bridge and Holsten Gate were renewed in 1376. There is good evidence for the appearance of the gate erected at that time in a woodcut of a view of the city of Lübeck produced by Elias Diebel. Although this is a city view from the eastern, Wakenitz side of the old inner city hill, the artist has folded out essential parts of the gate&#x27;s west side, so that they too become visible. It was a rectangular tower with a wooden gallery on the upper part.

At an unknown date in the 17th century, the Inner Holsten Gate was replaced by a smaller, simple half-timbered gate—possibly because no point was seen in having a strong inner gate in light of the strong outer fortifications which had been erected in the meantime. The Inner Holsten Tor was connected to the dwelling of the tollkeeper, who guarded the access to the city at this location.

The half-timbered gate was replaced by a simple iron gate in 1794, which in turn was demolished in 1828, together with the tollkeeper&#x27;s house and the city wall along the Trave River.

It is likely that there was a gate also on the opposite bank of the Trave at an early date. But nothing is known of its appearance. If it existed, it was torn down before or after the construction of the Middle Holsten Gate.

=== Middle Holsten Gate ===
In the 15th century the entire gate construction was considered to be inadequate. The proliferation of firearms and canon made stronger fortifications necessary. It was decided to build another gate—the Outer Holsten Gate, later known as the Middle Holsten Gate and today only as the Holsten Gate. Funding was secured by a legacy of the councilman John Broling amounting to 4,000 Lübeck marks. In 1464 the city&#x27;s architect, Hinrich Helmstede, began construction, which was completed in 1478. It was erected on a seven-metre high hill raised for the purpose. Already during the construction period this foundation proved to be unstable. The south tower sagged because of the marshy ground and already during constructions attempts were made to compensate for its inclination.

For more history of the Middle Holsten Gate see the section on demolition and restoration below.

=== Outer Holsten Gate ===
The exterior Holsten Gate was also known as the Renaissance Gate, the Foregate or the Crooked Gate. It was constructed in the 16th century when a wall was built west of the Middle Holsten Gate into which a gate was inserted. The outer Holsten Gate was completed in 1585. The new gate obstructed the view of the Middle Holsten Gate since its eastern exit was located only 20 metres from that construction. A walled area known as the &quot;zwinger&quot; was created between the two gates.

Its foregate was small compared with the approximately one hundred years older Middle Holsten Gate, but much more richly decorated on the field side. The city side was by contrast left plain. The Outer Holsten Gate was the first gate to bear an inscription. It read, &quot;Pulchra res est pax foris et concordia domi – MDLXXXV&quot; (&quot;It is wonderful to have peace without and harmony within - 1585&quot;) and was placed on the city side. It was later moved to the field side and slightly modified (&quot;Concordia domi et foris pax sane res est omnium pulcherrima&quot;, &quot;harmony within and peace without are the greatest good of all&quot;). Connected to the gate was the home of the Wall Master, who was responsible for the maintenance of the fortifications.

The builder of the Renaissance gate was probably the city architect Hermann von Rode, who designed the front following Dutch prototypes. For example, the Nieuwe Oosterpoort in Hoorn is directly comparable. This gate existed for about 250 years and was in the end sacrificed to the railway; it was demolished in 1853 to make room for the first Lübeck train station and tracks. Today, this station no longer exists either; the present station is located about 500 metres to the west.

=== Second Outer Holsten Gate ===
At the beginning of the 17th century new city walls were built in front of the city moat, under the supervision of military engineer Johhann von Brüssel. As part of this construction a fourth Holsten Gate was built in 1621. It was completely integranted into the high walls and topped by an octagonal tower. The archways bore the inscriptions &quot;Si Deus pro nobis, quis contra nos&quot; ( &quot;If God be for us, who can be against us?&quot;) on the city side and &quot;sub alis altissimi&quot; (&quot;Under the protection of the Most High&quot;) on the field side. This gate was the last of the four Holsten Gates to be constructed and the first to disappear, namely in 1808.

=== Demolition and restoration in the 19th century ===
In the course of industrialization, the fortifications were considered to be only annoying obstacles. In 1808 the second outer Holsten Gate was demolished, in 1828 the inner Holsten Gate, and in 1853 the outer Holsten Gate. It was then considered to be only as a matter of time before the Middle Holsten Gate, the only remaining of the four gates, would be torn down. Indeed, in 1855, Lübeck citizens petitioned the Senate to finally demolish the remaining gate, since it hindered the extension of the railway facilities. This petition had 683 signatures.

However, there was at that time also growing resistance to the destruction of old buildings. 
Thus August Reichensperger wrote in 1852, &quot;Even Lübeck, once the proud head of the Hanseatic League, does not seem able to endure the reflection of its former glory. It maims, crops and covers up so assiduously that &quot;modern Enlightenment&quot; will soon have nothing to be ashamed of any more&quot;. When King Frederick William IV of Prussia heard of this, he sent Prussia&#x27;s then-curator of historic monuments, Ferdinand von Quast, to salvage whatever could be saved.

Controversy over the demolition went on for a long time. A decision was made only in 1863 when the Lübeck citizens decided by a majority of just one vote not to demolish the building but to instead extensively restore it. Meanwhile, the gate was in very bad condition, since every year it had sunk a few centimetres further into the ground. The lowest loopholes were already 50 centimetres below ground, and the inclination of the entire gate was beginning to be dangerous. This drastically altered the statics of the building, so that its collapse was feared. The Holsten Gate was thoroughly restored, with work continuing into 1871.

Afterwards there was a change in the relationship of the Lübeck population to the Holsten Gate. It was no longer perceived as a troublesome ruin, but as a symbol of a proud past. In 1925, the German Association of Cities made the Holstentor its symbol. As early as 1901, the marzipan manufacturer Niederegger used the Holsten gate in its company trademark. Other Lübeck companies did the same.

=== Restoration 1933/34 ===
Since the towers continued to slant and their collapse could still not be ruled out, a second restoration became necessary. This occurred in the years 1933-34, during which the Holsten Gate was stabilized so that it finally stood firm. In this final restoration, reinforced concrete anchors were used to secure the towers, which were girded by iron rings. Changes were, however, also made which did not correspond with the original character of the gate, including the above-mentioned merging of north tower floors. The Nazis turned the Holsten Gate into a museum. It was called the Hall of Honor and Glory, and was supposed to represent Lübeck and German history from the perspective of Nazi ideology.

In the second half of the 20th century minor repairs were made to the Holsten Gate which are no longer in line with current standards for architectural conservation.

=== Restoration 2005/06 ===
From March 2005 to December 2006, the Holsten Gate was again restored. The restoration was estimated to cost around one million euros, with 498,000 euros (the originally planned cost) being provided by the German Foundation for Monument Protection and the Possehl Foundation. The remaining costs were primarily covered through donations from individuals, companies and academic institutions. A swastika dating from 1934 was cut out and taken away by unknown parties a few days after the scaffolding was installed for the repairs. It was considered to be the last swastika still remaining on a public building in Germany and was supposed to be concealed with metal sheeting as part of the restoration work. A plate with the date 2006 was put up where the stolen swastika had been to commemorate the completion of restoration work.

On 2 December 2006, the Holstentor reopened to the public as part of a light show created by the artist Michael Batz. For safety reasons the gate had been obscured during restoration by a high resolution depiction of the gate before work had begun, printed on scaffolding tarpaulins.

== The Holsten Gate today ==
In 1950 the Holsten Gate was again a museum, this time for municipal history. Relics from historic Lübeck were presented, the development of medieval Lübeck was shown by using models and pictures, and models of the ships of the Hanseatic League and the flagship &quot;Eagle of Lübeck&quot; were exhibited. The features of this museum were also not historically accurate. For example, the museum also included a torture chamber with a dungeon, a rack and other torture devices. But the Holsten Gate had never contained anything like that.

The two monumental iron statues of reclining lions placed in an area in front of the Holsten Gate designed by Harry Maasz date from 1823 and are unsigned. They are attributed to Christian Daniel Rauch and may possibly have been made with the collaboration of a member of Rauch&#x27;s workshop, Th. Kalide (1801–1863). One lion is asleep, the other is awake and attentively regards the other. They were originally placed in front of the house built in 1840 by the Lübeck merchant and art collector John Daniel Jacobj (1798–1847) at Große Petersgrube 18. In 1873 they were placed in front of the Hotel Stadt Hamburg am Klingenberg until its destruction in 1942 during World War II, and only later in front of the Holsten Gate. They are complemented by a bronze statue on the other side of the street, the Striding Antilope, by the sculptor Fritz Behn.

The Holsten Gate Museum was modernized in 2002. Not only was the torture chamber removed; all rooms were redesigned according to a new concept that involved the integration of image and sound documentation. As of 2006, the museum has been managed by the Cultural Foundation of the Hanseatic City of Lübeck.

== Surroundings ==
The Holsten Gate is located in the Lübeck city wall complex on the main access road connecting the main railway station with the suburb of St. Lorenz and crossing the Puppen Bridge. The Holsten Gate Square (&quot;Holstentorplatz&quot;) is enclosed on one side by a branch of the Deutsche Bundesbank; with new construction extending the original Reichsbank building to the rear. On the other side there is the brick expressionist Holsten Gate Hall (&quot;Holstentorhalle&quot;) between the historic salt warehouses and the DGB&#x27;s House of Trade Unions (&quot;Gewerkschaftshaus&quot;). This building was altered with funds from the Possehl Foundation to create a rehearsal and teaching facility for Lübeck&#x27;s University of Music (&quot;Musikhochschule Lübeck&quot;) was rebuilt. Another pedestrian bridge over the Upper Trave River was completed in spring 2007 to provide a connection the university&#x27;s main building complex in the old city centre.

==Miscellaneous==

=== On currency and postage stamps ===
The Holsten Gate appears on the 50 DM bank notes produced from 1960 to 1991 and on the German two-euro coin issued in 2006.

In 1948 it appeared on the four highest denominations (DM 1, DM 2, DM 3 and DM 5) of the first long-term series of postage stamps in German mark currency, which featured buildings. In 1997 it appeared on the 510 Pf. postage stamp of another definitive series, &quot;Places of Interest&quot;.

=== In video games ===
The gate appeared in the trading simulation &quot;The Patrician&quot;.

The gate also appeared as a landmark in the Maxis PC game Simcity 3000.

=== Other uses ===
Since 1926 there has been a stylization of the Holsten Gate in the emblem of the German Association of Cities (Deutscher Städtetag DST).

A simplified and scaled-down replica of the Holsten Gate was completed in 2008 for the Hansa Park in Sierksdorf.

The current Guinness World Record for the fastest marathon dressed as a landmark building was achieved by a Richard Mietz wearing a Holstentor costume at the 2018 Berlin Marathon

The Amphicar (a mass-produced amphibious automobile) built in Lübeck in the 1960s, sports a golden image of the Holstentor on the horn button in the center of the steering wheel. Many people who see the Amphicar think the emblem is a castle.

<text>Topology of a transmembrane protein refers to locations of N- and C-termini of membrane-spanning polypeptide chain with respect to the inner or outer sides of the biological membrane occupied by the protein.

Several databases provide experimentally determined topologies of membrane proteins. They include Uniprot, TOPDB, OPM, and ExTopoDB. There is also a database of domains located conservatively on a certain side of membranes, TOPDOM.

Several computational methods were developed, with a limited success, for predicting transmembrane alpha-helices and their topology. Pioneer methods utilized the fact that membrane-spanning regions contain more hydrophobic residues than other parts of the protein, however applying different hydrophobic scales altered the prediction results. Later, several statistical methods were developed to improve the topography prediction and a special alignment method was introduced. According to the positive-inside rule, cytosolic loops near the lipid bilayer contain more positively-charged amino acids. Applying this rule resulted in the first topology prediction methods. There is also a negative-outside rule in transmembrane alpha-helices from single-pass proteins, although negatively charged residues are rarer than positively charged residues in transmembrane segments of proteins. As more structures were determined, machine learning algorithms appeared. Supervised learning methods are trained on a set of experimentally determined structures, however, these methods highly depend on the training set. Unsupervised learning methods are based on the principle that topology depends on the maximum divergence of the amino acid distributions in different structural parts. It was also shown that locking a segment location based on prior knowledge about the structure improves the prediction accuracy. This feature has been added to some of the existing prediction methods. The most recent methods use consensus prediction (i.e. they use several algorithms to determine the final topology) and automatically incorporate previously determined experimental informations. HTP database provides a collection of topologies that are computationally predicted for human transmembrane proteins.

Discrimination of signal peptides and transmembrane segments is an additional problem in topology prediction treated with a limited success by different methods. Both signal peptides and transmembrane segments contain hydrophobic regions which form α-helices. This causes the cross-prediction between them, which is a weakness of many transmembrane topology predictors. By predicting signal peptides and transmembrane helices simultaneously (Phobius), the errors caused by cross-prediction are reduced and the performance is substantially increased. Another feature used to increase the accuracy of the prediction is the homology (PolyPhobius).”

It is also possible to predict beta-barrel membrane proteins&#x27; topology.

<text>c&#x27;t – (; &quot;Magazine for Computer Technology&quot;) is a biweekly German computer magazine, published by the Heinz Heise publishing house of Hanover. 
==History and profile==
The first issue of the magazine was the November/December 1983 edition. Originally a special section of the electronics magazine &quot;elrad&quot;, the magazine has been published monthly since December 1983 and biweekly since October 1997. A Dutch edition also exists which is published monthly. In addition, since 2008 a Russian licensed-title version named &quot;&quot; is published in Moscow.

The magazine is the second most popular German-language computer magazine with a circulation of about 315,000 (; printed circulation: 419,000). With 241,000 subscriptions it is the computer magazine with the most subscribers in Europe.

&quot;c&#x27;t&quot; covers both hardware and software; it focuses on software for the Microsoft Windows platform, but Linux and Apple are also regularly featured. The magazine has a reputation of being thorough, although critics claim that the magazine has been &quot;dumbed down&quot; in recent years to accommodate the mass market.

One of the numerous projects &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; initiated is the WSUS Offline Update, a set of scripts to download Microsoft updates, combine it with an install script, and create a CD image. With Offline Update burned to a CD or DVD, a technician can update Windows 2000/XP/Vista and Microsoft Office 2003/2007 without an Internet connection. This is especially useful for people with no or slow Internet connections, or not exposing a vulnerable system to the Internet.

A sister magazine, &quot;iX&quot;, focuses on topics for IT professionals.

== Popularity ==
&quot;c&#x27;t&quot; became widely known in 1995 when it rated the program SoftRAM95 &quot;Placebo-Software&quot; in a limited test. When the German distributor of the program took legal action to prohibit this rating, &quot;c&#x27;t&quot; followed up with a more extensive test showing the product had virtually no effect other than giving misleading data about system statistics. Subsequent media coverage led to SoftRAM95 being removed from the German and US markets. In a 1996 interview, Rainer Poertner, the German-born CEO of Syncronys Softcorp which released SoftRAM95, took responsibility for forcing the product&#x27;s release before its development was complete.

<text>Condom (; ), also known as Condom-en-Armagnac, is a commune in southwestern France in the department of Gers, of which it is a subprefecture.

== Geography ==
=== Localisation ===
The town of Condom is located in the northern part of the department of Gers, halfway between Mont-de-Marsan (to the west) and Montauban (to the east), and north of Auch.

=== Roads and transports ===
;Way of St. James
Condom is a town on the Via Podiensis, one of the three major French arms of the pilgrimage route, the Way of St. James.

This particular route begins in Le Puy and ends in Santiago de Compostela in northwest Spain. Pilgrims arrive at Condom after Miradoux and continue on to Larressingle.

== Toponymy ==
The toponym &quot;Condom&quot; comes from the Gaulish words &quot;condate&quot; and &quot;magos&quot; combined into &quot;Condatomagos&quot;, which means &quot;market or field, of the confluence&quot;.

&quot;Condatómagos&quot; evolved into &quot;Condatóm&quot; and then into &quot;Conddóm&quot;. &quot;Condom&quot; was first recorded in Latin in the 10th century as &#x27; or &#x27;. It is where the river Gèle flows into the river Baïse.

Although the French word for a &quot;condom&quot; is &quot;&quot;, in 1995 the town&#x27;s mayor, taking advantage of the incidental relationship between the town&#x27;s name and the English word, opened a museum of contraceptives. It operated until 2005.

== Politics and administration ==

== Population ==
==Tourism==
Condom is the site of two castles, the Château de Mothes and the Château de Pouypardin, both started in the 13th century. In total, 19 sites in Condom are listed as &quot;monuments historiques&quot; by the French Ministry of Culture, including the cathedral, churches and houses.

Condom is known for the production of Armagnac, an international music festival of &quot;bandas&quot;, an international chess tournament and an international chess marathon. It is also known for its tourism with farm campings and boating on waterways. It is also home to a museum about Armagnac.

A statue of The Three Musketeers and d&#x27;Artagnan stands beside the cathedral and was created in 2010 by Zurab Tsereteli.

<text>Buzkashi () is the national sport of Afghanistan. It is a traditional sport in which horse-mounted players attempt to place a goat or calf carcass in a goal. Similar games are known as kokpar, kupkari, and ulak tartysh in Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.


==History==
Buzkashi began among the nomadic Asian tribes who came from farther north and east spreading westward from China and Mongolia between the 10th and 15th centuries in a centuries-long series of migrations that ended only in the 1930s. From Scythian times until recent decades, buzkashi has remained a legacy of that bygone era.

==Distribution==
Games similar to buzkashi are played today by several Central Asian ethnic groups such as the Uzbeks, Kyrgyz, Turkmens, Kazakhs, Uyghurs, Tajiks, Wakhis and Pashtuns. In the West, the game is also played by Kyrgyz who migrated to Ulupamir village in the Van district of Turkey from the Pamir region. In western China, there is not only horse-back buzkashi, but also yak buzkashi among the Tajiks of Xinjiang.

===Afghanistan===
Buzkashi is the national sport and a &quot;passion&quot; in Afghanistan where it is often played on Fridays and matches draw thousands of fans. Whitney Azoy notes in his book &quot;Buzkashi: Game and Power in Afghanistan&quot; that &quot;leaders are men who can seize control by means foul and fair and then fight off their rivals. The buzkashi rider does the same&quot;. Traditionally, games could last for several days, but in its more regulated tournament version, it has a limited match time.

During the first reign of the Taliban government in Afghanistan, buzkashi was banned as they considered the game immoral. After the Afghan Taliban was ousted in 2001, the sport resumed. When the Taliban regained power in 2021, they allowed the sport to continue.
===Kazakhstan===
Kazakhstan&#x27;s first National Kokpar Association was registered in 2000. The association has been holding annual kokpar championships among adults since 2001 and youth kokpar championships since 2005. All 14 regions of Kazakhstan have professional kokpar teams. The regions with the biggest number of professional kokpar teams are Southern Kazakhstan with 32 professional teams, Jambyl region with 27 teams and Akmola region with 18 teams. Kazakhstan&#x27;s national kokpar team currently holds a title of Eurasian kokpar champions.

===Kyrgyzstan===
A photograph documents &quot;kokboru&quot; players in Kyrgyzstan around 1870; however, Kyrgyzstan&#x27;s kokboru rules were first officially defined and regulated in 1949. Starting from 1958 kokboru began being held in hippodromes. The size of a kokboru field depends on the number of participants.

===Tajikistan===
The buzkashi season in Tajikistan generally runs from November through April. High temperatures often prevent matches from taking place outside of this period, though isolated games might be found in some cooler mountain areas.

In Tajikistan and among the Tajik people of Tashkorgan in China&#x27;s Xinjiang region, buzkashi games are particularly popular in relation to weddings as the games are sponsored by the father of the bride as part of the festivities.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan, buzkashi has traditionally been very popular in the areas bordering Afghanistan. Although the sport is dying, it is still played by the Wakhi people of Hunza in Gilgit Baltistan and by the Pashtuns including Afghan refugees in parts of Balochistan.

=== United States ===
Buzkashi was brought to the U.S. by a descendant from the Afghan Royal Family, the family of King Amanullah and King Zahir Shah. A mounted version of the game has also been played in the United States in the 1940s. Young men in Cleveland, Ohio, played a game they called &quot;kav kaz&quot;. The men – five to a team – played on horseback with a sheepskin-covered ball. The Greater Cleveland area had six or seven teams. The game was divided into three &quot;chukkers&quot;, somewhat like polo. The field was about the size of a football field and had goals at each end: large wooden frameworks standing on tripods, with holes about two feet square. The players carried the ball in their hands, holding it by the long-fleeced sheepskin. A team had to pass the ball three times before throwing it into the goal. If the ball fell to the ground, the player had to reach down from his horse to pick it up. One player recalls, &quot;Others would try to unseat the rider as he leaned over. They would grab you by the shoulder to shove you off. There weren&#x27;t many rules.&quot;

Mounted team-based potato races, a popular pastime in early 20th-century America, bore some resemblance to buzkashi, although on a much smaller and tamer scale.

==Rules and variations==

Competition is typically fierce. Prior to the establishment of official rules by the Afghan Olympic Federation, the sport was mainly conducted based upon rules such as not whipping a fellow rider intentionally or deliberately knocking him off his horse. Riders usually wear heavy clothing and head protection to protect themselves against other players&#x27; whips and boots. For example, riders in the former Soviet Union often wear salvaged Soviet tank helmets for protection. The boots usually have high heels that lock into the saddle of the horse to help the rider lean on the side of the horse while trying to pick up the goat. Games can last for several days, and the winning team receives a prize, not necessarily money, as a reward for their win. Top players, such as Aziz Ahmad, are often sponsored by wealthy Afghans.

A buzkashi player is called a &quot;chapandaz&quot; (); it is mainly believed in Afghanistan that a skilful chapandaz is usually in his forties. This is based on the fact that the nature of the game requires its player to undergo severe physical practice and observation. Similarly, horses used in buzkashi also undergo severe training and due attention. A player does not necessarily own the horse. Horses are usually owned by landlords and highly rich people wealthy enough to look after and provide training facilities for such horses. However, a master chapandaz can choose to select any horse and the owner of the horse usually wants his horse to be ridden by a master Chapandaz as a winning horse also brings pride to the owner.

The game consists of two main forms: Tudabarai () and Qarajai (). Tudabarai is considered to be the simpler form of the game. In this version, the goal is simply to grab the carcass and move in any direction until clear of the other players. In Qarajai, players must carry the carcass around a flag or marker at one end of the field, then throw it into a scoring circle (the &quot;Circle of Justice&quot;) at the other end. The riders will carry a whip to fend off opposing horses and riders. When the rider&#x27;s hands are occupied, the whip is typically carried in the teeth. 

The calf in a buzkashi game is normally beheaded and disembowelled and has two limbs cut off. It is then soaked in cold water for 24 hours before play to toughen it. Occasionally sand is packed into the carcass to give it extra weight. Though a goat is used when no calf is available, a calf is less likely to disintegrate during the game. While players may not strap the calf to their bodies or saddles, it is acceptable—and common practice—to wedge the calf under one leg in order to free up the hands.

=== Afghanistan ===
These rules are strictly observed only for contests in Kabul.
# The ground has a square layout with each sidelong.
# Each team consists of 10 riders.
# Only five riders from each team can play in a half.
# The total duration of each half is 45 minutes.
# There is only one 15 minute break between the two halves.
# The game is supervised by a referee.

===Kyrgyzstan===

Rules of kokboru have undergone several changes throughout history. Modernized rules of kokboru are:
# There are two teams with 12 participants each.
# Only 4 players a team are allowed to play on the field at any given time.
# Teams are allowed to substitute players or their horses.
# The game is played on a field 200 meters long and 70 meters wide.
# Two &quot;kazans&quot; – big goals with a 4.4 meters in diameter and 1.2 meters high are placed on opposite sides of a field.
# The total duration of three periods is 60 minutes.
# There is a 10-minute break between each period.
# A goal is scored each time a ulak (goat carcass) is placed in an opponent&#x27;s kazan.
# A kokboru is brought to centre of the field after scoring a goal.

It is also prohibited to ride towards the spectators or receive spectators&#x27; assistance or to start a kokboru game without giving an oath to play justly.

===Tajikistan===
In Tajikistan, buzkashi is played in a variety of ways. The most common iteration is a free-form game, often played in a mountain valley or other natural arena, in which each player competes individually to seize the buz and carry it to a goal. Forming unofficial teams or alliances does occur, but is discouraged in favor of individual play. Often, dozens of riders will compete against one another simultaneously, making the scrum to retrieve a fallen buz a chaotic affair. Tajik buzkashi games typically consist of many short matches, with a prize being awarded to each player who successfully scores a point.

==In popular culture==
===In books and film adaptations===
Buzkashi is portrayed in several books, both fiction and non-fiction. It is shown in Steve Berry&#x27;s book &quot;The Venetian Betrayal&quot;. Buzkashi was the subject of a book called &quot;Horsemen of Afghanistan&quot; by French photojournalists Roland and Sabrina Michaud. Gino Strada wrote a book named after the sport (with the spelling Buskashì) in which he tells about his life as surgeon in Kabul in the days after the 9-11 strikes. P.J. O&#x27;Rourke also mentions the game in discussions about Afghanistan and Pakistan in the Foreign Policy section of &quot;Parliament of Whores&quot;, and Rory Stewart devotes a few sentences to it in &quot;The Places in Between&quot;.

Two books have been written about buzkashi which were later turned into films. The game is the subject of a novel by French novelist Joseph Kessel titled &quot;Les Cavaliers&quot; (aka &quot;Horsemen&quot;), which then became the basis of the film &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (1971). The film was directed by John Frankenheimer with Omar Sharif in the lead role, and U.S. actor and accomplished horseman Jack Palance as his father, a legendary retired chapandaz. This film shows Afghanistan and its people the way they were before the wars that wracked the country, particularly their love for the sport of buzkashi.

The game is also a key element in the book &quot;Caravans&quot; by James Michener and the film of the same name (1978) starring Anthony Quinn. A scene from the film featuring the king of Afghanistan watching a game included the real-life king at the time, Mohammed Zahir Shah. The whole sequence of the game being witnessed by the king was filmed on the Kabul Golf Course, where the national championships were played at the time the film was made.

In Ken Follett&#x27;s book, &quot;Lie Down with Lions&quot; (1986), the game is mentioned being played, but instead of a goat, a live Russian soldier is used.

In &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; (2003) by Khaled Hosseini, the protagonist, Amir returns to Afghanistan from the United States several years later, when the Taliban has taken over the government. He attends a game of Buzkashi, in which the audience was forced by the Taliban authorities circling the stadium to remain silent during the match. During the break, a Taliban leader, who is later revealed to be Amir&#x27;s childhood enemy Assef, brings prisoners convicted of breaking the Sharia law in the stadium to be executed by stoning. The Taliban authorities, who were forcing the audience to be silent during the match, begin forcing everyone to cheer the stoning of the criminals.

===In film===
A number of films also reference the game. 
&quot;La Passe du Diable&quot;, a French 1956 film by Jacques Dupont and Pierre Schoendoerfer, concerns Buzkashi players. &quot;The Horsemen&quot; (1971) starring Jack Palance and Omar Sharif as father and son is centered on the game. Both &quot;La Passe du Diable&quot; and &quot;The Horseman&quot; are based on a novel by Joseph Kessel. 
In &quot;Rambo III&quot; (1988), directed by Peter MacDonald, John Rambo (played by Sylvester Stallone) was shown in a sequence playing and scoring in a buzkashi with his mujahideen friends when suddenly they were attacked by Soviet forces. The Tom Selleck film &quot;High Road to China&quot; (1983) features a spirited game of buzkashi. Buzkashi is described at length in Episode 2, &quot;The Harvest of the Seasons&quot;, of the documentary &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; by Jacob Bronowski. It is put in the context of the domestication of the horse and the effect of nomadic warbands and raiders on agricultural settlements. The film includes several scenes from a game in Afghanistan. The opening scenes of the Indian film &quot;Khuda Gawah&quot; (1992), which was filmed in Afghanistan and India, show actors Amitabh Bachchan and Sridevi engaged in the game. The game also shown in other Indian films like &quot;Kabul Express&quot; (2006) and &quot;Sahasam&quot; (2013).

The 2012 joint international-Afghan short film &quot;Buzkashi Boys&quot; depicts a fictional story centered on the game, and has won awards at several international film festivals.
On January 10, 2013, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated &quot;Buzkashi Boys&quot; for an Oscar in the category of Short Film (Live Action) for the 85th Academy Awards.

Venerated Buzkashi (ulak tartysh in Kyrgyz) player, 82 year old veteran school teacher Khamid Boronov stars in 2016 feature documentary film &quot;Letters from the Pamirs&quot; by Janyl Jusupjan. Famed Buzkashi players of Jaylgan village Shamsidin and Kazyke appear in a sequence to show the elements of Buzkashi to kids from a town. A spirited Buzkashi match is one of the last episodes of the film made in Jerge-Tal Kyrgyz region in Tajikistan&#x27;s north.

<text>Sextus Julius Frontinus (c. 40 – 103 AD) was a Roman civil engineer, author, soldier and senator of the late 1st century AD. He was a successful general under Domitian, commanding forces in Roman Britain, and on the Rhine and Danube frontiers. A &quot;novus homo&quot;, he was consul three times. Frontinus ably discharged several important administrative duties for Nerva and Trajan. However, he is best known to the post-Classical world as an author of technical treatises, especially &quot;De aquaeductu&quot;, dealing with the aqueducts of Rome.

== Family ==
Due to a lack of either a &quot;titulus honorarius&quot; or &quot;sepulcralis&quot;, there is no outline of Frontinus&#x27; life, the names of his parents, or of his wife. Some details can be inferred from chance mentions: He is thought to be of Narbonese origins, and originally of the equestrian class. From the nomenclature of the name of Publius Calvisius Ruso Julius Frontinus (consul c. 84), it is likely Frontinus had a sister, who was the other&#x27;s mother. Frontinus had at least one daughter, the wife of Quintus Sosius Senecio (cos. 99, II 107) and mother of Sosia Polla.

== Career ==
In AD 70, Frontinus participated in the suppression of the Rhineland revolt, and later recorded that he received the surrender of 70,000 Lingones. Between that date and being appointed governor of Britain to succeed Quintus Petillius Cerialis a few years later, Frontinus was appointed suffect consul. While governor of Britain, he subjugated the Silures of South Wales and is thought to have likewise campaigned against the Brigantes. He was succeeded by Gnaeus Julius Agricola, the father-in-law of the famous historian Tacitus, in 77. Birley believes it &quot;is fair to speculate&quot; that Frontinus was with Domitian during the German campaign of 83. An inscription at Hieropolis in Phrygia, as well as a number of coins of Smyrna, attests that he was proconsul of Asia in AD 86.

In 97, he was appointed &quot;curator aquarum&quot; (supervisor of the aqueducts) by the emperor Nerva, an office only conferred upon persons of very high standing. In this capacity, he followed another distinguished Roman statesman, Agrippa, the friend, ally and son-in-law of Augustus, who organised in 34 BC a campaign of public repairs and improvements, including renovation of the aqueduct Aqua Marcia and an extension of its pipes to cover more of the city.

The following year Frontinus held a second consulship as suffect in February, with Trajan as his colleague, and two years later he was made &quot;consul ordinarius&quot; with Trajan. Birley notes, &quot;This exceptional honour underlines the high regard in which he [Frontinus] was held, and suggests, further, that Trajan had a debt to repay.&quot; He was also a member of the College of Augurs. He died in 103 or 104, a date based on Pliny the Younger writing to his friends that he was elected to the college of augurs to fill the vacancy Frontinus&#x27; death had created.

== Writings ==
===Aqueducts of Rome===

Frontinus&#x27;s chief work is &quot;De aquaeductu&quot;, in two books, an official report to the emperor on the state of the aqueducts of Rome. It presents a history and description of the water-supply of Rome, including the laws relating to its use and maintenance. He provides the history, sizes and discharge rates of all of the nine aqueducts of Rome at the time at which he was writing at the turn of the 1st century AD: the Aqua Marcia, Aqua Appia, Aqua Alsietina, Aqua Tepula, Anio Vetus, Anio Novus, Aqua Virgo, Aqua Claudia and Aqua Augusta. Frontinus describes the quality of water delivered by each, mainly depending on their source, be it river, lake, or spring.

====Fraud and theft====
One of the first jobs he undertook when he was appointed water commissioner was to prepare maps of the system so that he could assess their condition before undertaking their maintenance. He says that many had been neglected and were not working at their full capacity. He was especially concerned by diversion of the supply by unscrupulous farmers and tradesmen, among many others. They would insert pipes into the channel of the aqueducts to tap the supply. He, therefore, made a meticulous survey of the intake and the supply of each line, and then investigated the discrepancies. Lead pipe stamps bearing the name of the owner were also used to prevent such water theft. He was well aware of the seminal work &quot;De architectura&quot; by Vitruvius, which mentions aqueduct construction and maintenance published in the previous century; Frontinus refers to the possible influence of Vitruvius on the plumbers.

====Distribution system====
Distribution of the water depended in a complex way on its height entering the city, the quality of the water, and its rate of discharge. Thus, poor-quality water would be sent for irrigation, gardens, or flushing, while only the best would be reserved for drinking water. Intermediate-quality water would be used for the many baths and fountains. However, Frontinus criticized the practice of mixing supplies from different sources, and one of his first decisions was to separate the waters from each system.

====Maintenance====
He was very concerned by leaks in the system, especially those in the underground conduits, which were difficult to locate and mend, a problem still faced by water engineers today. The aqueducts above ground needed care to ensure that the masonry was kept in good condition, especially those running on arched superstructures. It was, he said, essential to keep trees at a distance so that their roots would not damage the structures. He reviewed the existing law governing the state aqueducts, as well as the need for enforcement of those statutes.

===Military tactics===
Frontinus also wrote a theoretical treatise on military science, which is lost. His extant work on military matters, the &quot;Stratagems&quot; (Latin: &quot;Strategemata&quot;), is a collection of examples of military stratagems from Greek and Roman history, for the use of generals. He draws on his own experience as a general in Germania under Domitian, but similarities between the anecdotes he records and versions of other Roman authors like Valerius Maximus and Livy suggest that he drew mainly on literary sources. The authenticity of the fourth book has been challenged.
One example he gives of control of river water during a siege reads:

<doc id="169474" wikidata="Q1127109" url="?curid=169474" title="Silures">
<text>The Silures ( , ) were a powerful and warlike tribe or tribal confederation of ancient Britain, occupying what is now south east Wales and perhaps some adjoining areas. They were bordered to the north by the Ordovices; to the east by the Dobunni; and to the west by the Demetae.

== Origins ==
According to Tacitus&#x27;s biography of Agricola, the Silures usually had a dark complexion and curly hair. Due to their appearance, Tacitus believed they had crossed over from Spain at an earlier date.The dark complexion of the Silures, their usually curly hair, and the fact that Spain is the opposite shore to them, are an evidence that Iberians of a former date crossed over and occupied these parts.

Jordanes, in his Origins and Deeds of the Goths, describes the Silures.
The Silures have swarthy features and are usually born with curly black hair, but the inhabitants of Caledonia have reddish hair and large loose-jointed bodies. They are like the Gauls or the Spaniards.

The Iron Age hillfort at Llanmelin near Caerwent has sometimes been suggested as a pre-Roman tribal centre. But some archaeologists believe that the people who became known as the Silures were a loose network of groups with some shared cultural values, rather than a centralised society. Although the most obvious physical remains of the Silures are hillforts such as those at Llanmelin and Sudbrook, there is also archaeological evidence of roundhouses at Gwehelog, Thornwell (Chepstow) and elsewhere, and evidence of lowland occupation notably at Goldcliff.

== Etymology ==
The Latin word is of Celtic origin, perhaps derived from the Common Celtic root , &#x27;seed&#x27;. Words derived from this root in Celtic languages (for example Old Irish , Welsh ) are used to mean &#x27;blood-stock, descendants, lineage, offspring&#x27;, as well as &#x27;seed&#x27; in the vegetable sense. Silures might therefore mean &#x27;kindred, stock&#x27;, perhaps referring to a tribal belief in a descent from an originating ancestor. Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel hypothesises that the Silures were originally referred to as , &#x27;rich in grain&#x27;.

==Roman resistance==
The Silures fiercely resisted Roman conquest about AD 48, with the assistance of Caratacus, a military leader and prince of the Catuvellauni, who had fled from further east after his own tribe was defeated.

The first attack on the Welsh tribes was by the legate Publius Ostorius Scapula about AD 48. Ostorius first attacked the Deceangli in the north-east of what is now Wales, however little else is known or recorded of this conflict. He spent several years campaigning against the Silures and the Ordovices. Their resistance was led by Caratacus, who had fled from the south-east (of what is now England) when it was conquered by the Romans. He first led the Silures, then moved to the territory of the Ordovices, where he was defeated by Ostorius in AD 51.

The Silures were not subdued, however, and waged effective guerrilla warfare against the Roman forces. Ostorius had announced that they posed such a danger that they should be either exterminated or transplanted. His threats only increased the Silures&#x27; determination to resist. They surrounded and attacked a large legionary force occupied in building Roman forts in their territory; it was rescued by others only with difficulty and considerable loss. The Silures also took Roman prisoners as hostages and distributed them amongst their neighbouring tribes in order to bind them together and encourage resistance.

Ostorius died with the Silures still unconquered. After his death, they defeated the Second Legion. It remains unclear whether the Silures were militarily defeated or simply agreed to come to terms, but Roman sources suggest rather opaquely that they were eventually subdued by Sextus Julius Frontinus in a series of campaigns ending about AD 78. The Roman Tacitus wrote of the Silures: &quot;non atrocitate, non clementia mutabatur&quot; – the tribe &quot;was changed neither by cruelty nor by clemency&quot;.

== Romanization ==
To aid the Roman administration in keeping down local opposition, a legionary fortress (Isca, later Caerleon) was planted in the midst of tribal territory.

The town of Venta Silurum (Caerwent, six miles west of Chepstow) was established in AD 75. It became a Romanized town, not unlike Calleva Atrebatum (Silchester), but smaller. An inscription shows that, under the Roman Empire, it was the capital of the Silures, whose &quot;ordo&quot; (local council) provided local government for the district. Its massive Roman walls still survive, and excavations have revealed a forum, a temple, baths, amphitheatre, shops, and many comfortable houses with mosaic floors, etc. In the late 1st and early 2nd centuries, the Silures were given some nominal independence and responsibility for local administration. As was standard practice, as revealed by inscriptions, the Romans matched their deities with local Silurian ones, and the local deity Ocelus was identified with Mars, the Roman god of war.

Caerwent seems to have continued in use in the post-Roman period as a religious centre. The territory of the Silures later developed as the 5th-century Welsh kingdoms of Gwent, Brycheiniog, and Gwynllŵg. Some theories concerning King Arthur make him a leader in this area. There is evidence of cultural continuity throughout the Roman period, from the Silures to the kingdom of Gwent in particular, as shown by leaders of Gwent using the name &quot;Caradoc&quot; in remembrance of the British hero Caratacus.

==The term &quot;Silurian&quot;==
Reference is occasionally made to this period of Celtic history by the use of terms such as &quot;Silurian&quot;. The poet Henry Vaughan called himself a &quot;Silurist&quot;, by virtue of his roots in South Wales.

The geological period Silurian was first described by Roderick Murchison in rocks located in the original lands of the Silures, hence the name. That period postdates the Cambrian and Ordovician periods, whose names are also derived from ancient Wales.

<doc id="169477" wikidata="Q7308137" url="?curid=169477" title="Regents of the University of California v. Bakke">
<text>Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. 265 (1978), was a landmark decision by the Supreme Court of the United States that involved a dispute over whether preferential treatment for minorities could reduce educational opportunities for whites without violating the Constitution. It upheld affirmative action, allowing race to be one of several factors in college admission policy. However, the court ruled that specific racial quotas, such as the 16 out of 100 seats set aside for minority students by the University of California, Davis, School of Medicine, were impermissible.

Although in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; the Supreme Court had outlawed segregation in schools and had ordered school districts to take steps to ensure integration, the question of the legality of voluntary affirmative action programs initiated by universities remained unresolved. Proponents deemed such programs necessary to make up for past discrimination, while opponents believed they violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A previous case that the Supreme Court had taken in an attempt to address the issue, &quot;DeFunis v. Odegaard&quot; (1974), had been dismissed on procedural grounds.

Allan P. Bakke (), an engineer and former Marine officer, sought admission to medical school but was rejected for admission partly because of his age — Bakke was in his early 30s while applying, which at least two institutions considered too old. After twice being rejected by the University of California, Davis, he brought suit in state court challenging the constitutionality of the school&#x27;s affirmative-action program. The California Supreme Court struck down the program as violative of the rights of white applicants and ordered Bakke admitted. The U.S. Supreme Court accepted the case amid wide public attention.

The ruling on the case was highly fractured. The nine justices issued a total of six opinions. The judgment of the court was written by Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr.; two different blocs of four justices joined various parts of Powell&#x27;s opinion. Finding diversity in the classroom to be a compelling state interest, Powell opined that affirmative action in general was allowed under the Constitution and the Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Nevertheless, UC Davis&#x27;s program went too far for a majority of justices; it was struck down and Bakke was admitted. The practical effect of &quot;Bakke&quot; was that most affirmative action programs continued without change. Questions about whether the &quot;Bakke&quot; case was merely a plurality opinion or binding precedent were addressed in 2003 when the court upheld Powell&#x27;s position in the majority opinion of &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;. However, in 2023, the Supreme Court reversed that position, finding that affirmative action in student admissions impermissibly violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; and &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina&quot;.

== Background ==
=== State of the law ===
In &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; (1954), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled segregation by race in public schools to be unconstitutional. In the following fifteen years, the court issued landmark rulings in cases involving race and civil liberties, but left supervision of the desegregation of Southern schools mostly to lower courts. Among other progressive legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VI of which forbids racial discrimination in any program or activity receiving federal funding. By 1968, integration of public schools was well advanced. In that year, the Supreme Court revisited the issue of school desegregation in &quot;Green v. County School Board&quot;, ruling that it was not enough to eliminate racially discriminatory practices; state governments were under an obligation to actively work to desegregate schools. The school board in &quot;Green&quot; had allowed children to attend any school, but few chose to attend those dominated by another race. In 1970, in &quot;Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education&quot;, the Supreme Court expanded the equitable powers of the district courts by upholding a district court order for busing of students as an appropriate remedy to desegregate a school system.

Although public universities were integrated by court decree, selective colleges and graduate programs, and the professions which stemmed from them, remained almost all white. Many African Americans had attended inferior schools and were ill-prepared to compete in the admissions process. This was unsatisfactory to many activists of the late 1960s, who protested that given the African American&#x27;s history of discrimination and poverty, some preference should be given to minorities. This became a commonly held liberal position, and large numbers of public and private universities began affirmative action programs. Among these were the University of California, Davis School of Medicine (UC Davis or &quot;the university&quot;), which was founded in 1968 and had an all-white inaugural class. The faculty was concerned by this, and the school began a special admissions program &quot;to compensate victims of unjust societal discrimination&quot;. The application form contained a question asking if the student wished to be considered disadvantaged, and, if so, these candidates were screened by a special committee, on which more than half the members were from minority groups. Initially, the entering class was 50 students, and eight seats were put aside for minorities; when the class size doubled in 1971, there were 16 seats that were to be filled by candidates recommended by the special committee. While nominally open to whites, no one of that race was admitted under the program, which was unusual in that a specific number of seats were to be filled by candidates through this program.

The first case taken by the Supreme Court on the subject of the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education was &quot;DeFunis v. Odegaard&quot; (1974). Marco DeFunis, a white man, had twice been denied admission to the University of Washington School of Law. The law school maintained an affirmative-action program, and DeFunis had been given a higher rating by admissions office staff than some admitted minority candidates. The Washington state trial court ordered DeFunis admitted, and he attended law school while the case was pending. The Washington Supreme Court reversed the trial court, but the order was stayed, and DeFunis remained in school. The U.S. Supreme Court granted review and the case was briefed and argued, but by then, DeFunis was within months of graduation. The law school stated in its briefs that, even if it won, it would not dismiss him. After further briefing on the question of mootness, the Supreme Court dismissed the case, 5–4, holding that as DeFunis had almost completed his studies, there was no longer a case or controversy to decide. Justice William Brennan, in an opinion joined by the other three members of the minority, accused the court of &quot;sidestepping&quot; the issues, which &quot;must inevitably return to the federal courts and ultimately again to this court&quot;.

=== Allan Bakke ===
Allan Paul Bakke (born 1940), a white male, applied to twelve medical schools in 1973. He had been a National Merit Scholar at Coral Gables Senior High School in Coral Gables, Florida. Bakke attended the University of Minnesota for his undergraduate studies, deferring tuition costs by joining the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps. He graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1963 with a 3.51 GPA. In order to fulfill his ROTC requirements, he joined the Marine Corps and served four years, including a seven-month tour of duty in Vietnam as a commanding officer of an anti-aircraft battery. In 1967, having achieved the rank of captain, he was granted an honorable discharge. Bakke then worked as an engineer at NASA. He stated that his interest in medicine started in Vietnam, and increased at NASA, as he had to consider the problems of space flight and the human body there. But twelve medical schools rejected his application for admission.

Bakke had applied first to the University of Southern California and Northwestern University, in 1972, and both rejected him, making a point of his age, with Northwestern writing that it was above their limit. Medical schools at the time openly practiced age discrimination.

Bakke applied late to UC Davis in 1973 because his mother-in-law was ill. This delay may well have cost him admission: although his credentials were outstanding even among applicants not part of the special program, by the time that his candidacy was considered under the school&#x27;s rolling admissions process, there were few seats left. His application reflected his anxiety about his age, referring to his years of sacrifice for his country as a cause of his interest in medicine.

Bakke received 468 points out of a possible 500 on the admissions committee&#x27;s rating scale in 1973. Earlier in the year, a rating of 470 had won automatic admission, with some promising applicants being admitted with lower scores. Bakke had a science GPA of 3.44 and an overall GPA of 3.46 after taking science courses at night to qualify for medical school. On the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT), Bakke scored in the 97th percentile in scientific knowledge, the 96th percentile in verbal ability, the 94th percentile in quantitative analysis, and the 72nd percentile in general knowledge. Bakke&#x27;s MCAT score overall was 72; the average applicant to UC Davis scored a 69 and the average applicant under the special program a 33. In March 1973, Bakke was invited to UC Davis for an interview. Dr. Theodore West, who met with him, described Bakke as “a well-qualified candidate for admission whose main hardship is the unavoidable fact that he is now 33. … On the grounds of motivation, academic records, potential promise, endorsement by persons capable of reasonable judgments, personal appearance and decorum, maturity, and probable contribution to balance in the class, I believe Mr. Bakke must be considered as a very desirable applicant and I shall so recommend him.” About two months later in May 1973, Bakke received notice of his rejection.

Bakke complained to Dr. George Lowrey, chairman of the admissions committee at the medical school, about the special admissions program. At Lowrey&#x27;s request, Assistant Dean Peter Storandt told Bakke that his candidacy had come close and encouraged him to reapply. If he was not accepted the second time, &quot;he could then research the legal question. He had been a good candidate. I thought he&#x27;d be accepted and that would end the matter.&quot; Storandt also gave Bakke the names of two lawyers interested in the issue of affirmative action. The general counsel for the University of California said, &quot;I don&#x27;t think Storandt meant to injure the university. It&#x27;s simply an example of a non-lawyer advising on legal matters.&quot; Storandt stated, &quot;I simply gave Allan the response you&#x27;d give an irate customer, to try and cool his anger. I realized the university might be vulnerable to legal attack because of its quota, and I had the feeling by then that somebody somewhere would sue the school, but I surely didn&#x27;t know this would be the case.&quot; Storandt was demoted and later left the university. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of the &quot;Bakke&quot; case, Storandt was fired.

Allan Bakke applied to UC Davis medical school again in 1974. He was interviewed twice: once by a student interviewer, who recommended his admission, and once by Dr. Lowrey, who in his report stated that Bakke &quot;had very definite opinions which were based more on his personal viewpoints than on a study of the whole problem … He was very unsympathetic to the concept of recruiting minority students.&quot; Lowrey gave Bakke a poor evaluation, the only part of his application on which he did not have a high score. He was rejected again, although minorities were admitted in both years with significantly lower academic scores through the special program. Not all minority applicants whose admission was recommended under the program gained entry—some were rejected by the admissions committee. This, however, did not affect the number of minority students to be admitted, sixteen. Although 272 white people between 1971 and 1974 had applied under this program, none had been successful; in 1974, the special admissions committee summarily rejected all white students who asked for admission under the program. Only one black student and six Latinos were admitted under the regular admissions program in that time period, though significant numbers of Asian students were given entry.

According to a 1976 &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article, the dean of the medical school sometimes intervened on behalf of daughters and sons of the university&#x27;s &quot;special friends&quot; in order to improve their chances. Among those who benefitted by Dean C. John Tupper&#x27;s interventions (about five per year) was the son of an influential state assemblyman, who had not even filed an application. The special picks were ended by order of University of California President David S. Saxon in 1976. Bakke&#x27;s lawyer deemed it impossible to tell if these picks caused Bakke not to be admitted, but, according to an attorney who filed an &quot;amicus curiae&quot; brief on behalf of the National Urban League in support of affirmative action, the practice of dean&#x27;s picks made the university reluctant to go into detail about its admission practices at trial, affecting its case negatively.

=== Lower court history ===
On June 20, 1974, following his second rejection from UC Davis, Bakke brought suit against the university&#x27;s governing board in the Superior Court of California, Yolo County. He sought an order admitting him on the ground that the special admission programs for minorities violated the U.S. and California constitutions, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. UC Davis&#x27;s counsel filed a request that the judge, F. Leslie Manker, find that the special program was constitutional and legal, and argued that Bakke would not have been admitted even if there had been no seats set aside for minorities. On November 20, 1974, Judge Manker found the program unconstitutional and in violation of Title VI, &quot;no race or ethnic group should ever be granted privileges or immunities not given to every other race.&quot; Manker ordered the medical school to disregard race as a factor, and to reconsider Bakke&#x27;s application under a race-free system. After Manker entered final judgment in the case on March 7, 1975, both parties appealed, the university on March 20 because the program was struck down, and Bakke on April 17 because he was not ordered admitted.

Because of the important issues presented, the Supreme Court of California on June 26, 1975, ordered the appeal transferred to it, bypassing the intermediate appeals court. On March 19, 1976, the case was argued before the state supreme court. Nine &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs were filed by various organizations, the majority in support of the university&#x27;s position. The California Supreme Court was considered one of the most liberal appellate courts, and it was widely expected that it would find the program to be legal. Nevertheless, on September 16, 1976, the court, in an opinion by Justice Stanley Mosk, upheld the lower-court ruling, 6–1. Mosk wrote that &quot;no applicant may be rejected because of his race, in favor of another who is less qualified, as measured by standards applied without regard to race&quot;. Justice Matthew O. Tobriner dissented, stating that Mosk&#x27;s suggestion that the state open more medical schools to accommodate both white and minority was unrealistic due to cost: &quot;It is a cruel hoax to deny minorities participation in the medical profession on the basis of such fanciful speculation.&quot; The court barred the university from using race in the admissions process and ordered it to provide evidence that Bakke would not have been admitted under a race-neutral program. When the university conceded its inability to do so in a petition for rehearing, the court on October 28, 1976, amended its ruling to order Bakke&#x27;s admission and denied the petition.

== U.S. Supreme Court consideration ==
=== Certiorari and amicus curiae briefs ===

The university requested that the U.S. Supreme Court stay the order requiring Bakke&#x27;s admission pending its filing of a petition asking for a review. U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Rehnquist, as circuit justice for the Ninth Circuit (California is within the Ninth Circuit) granted the stay for the court in November 1976.

The university filed a petition for a writ of certiorari in December 1976. The papers of some of the justices who participated in the &quot;Bakke&quot; case reveal that the case was three times considered by the court in January and February 1977. Four votes were needed for the court to grant certiorari, and it had at least that number each time; however, it was twice put over for reconsideration at the request of one of the justices. A number of civil rights organizations filed a joint brief as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;, urging the court to deny review, on the grounds that the &quot;Bakke&quot; trial had failed to develop the issues fully as the university had not introduced evidence of past discrimination or of bias in the MCAT. On February 22, the court granted certiorari, with the case to be argued in its October 1977 term.
The parties duly filed their briefs. The university&#x27;s legal team was now headed by former U.S. Solicitor General and Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox, who had argued many cases before the Supreme Court. Cox wrote much of the brief, and contended in it that &quot;the outcome of this controversy will decide for future generations whether blacks, Chicanos, and other insular minorities are to have meaningful access to higher education and real opportunities to enter the learned professions&quot;. The university also took the position that Bakke had been rejected because he was unqualified. Reynold Colvin, for Bakke, argued that his client&#x27;s rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal protection of the laws had been violated by the special admission program.

Fifty-eight &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs were filed, establishing a record for the Supreme Court that would stand until broken in the 1989 abortion case &quot;Webster v. Reproductive Health Services&quot;. Future justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg signed the ACLU&#x27;s brief supporting reversal in favor of the Regents; Marco deFunis, the petitioner in the 1974 case dismissed for mootness, wrote the brief for Young Americans for Freedom supporting affirmation in favor of Bakke.

In addition to the various other &quot;amici curiae&quot;, the United States filed a brief through the Solicitor General, as it may without leave of court under the Supreme Court&#x27;s rules. When consideration of &quot;Bakke&quot; began in the new administration of President Jimmy Carter, early drafts of the brief both supported affirmative action and indicated that the program should be struck down and Bakke admitted. This stance reflected the mixed support of affirmative action at that time by the Democrats. Minorities and others in that party complained, and, in late July 1977, Carter announced that the government&#x27;s brief would firmly support affirmative action. That document, filed October 3, 1977 (nine days before the oral argument), stated that the government supported programs tailored to make up for past discrimination, but opposed rigid set-asides. The United States urged the court to remand the case to allow for further fact-finding (a position also taken by civil rights groups in their &quot;amicus curiae&quot; briefs).

While the case was awaiting argument, another white student, Rita Clancy, sued for admission to UC Davis Medical School on the same grounds as Bakke had. In September 1977, she was ordered admitted pending the outcome of the &quot;Bakke&quot; case. After &quot;Bakke&quot; was decided, the university dropped efforts to oust her, stating that, as she had successfully completed one year of medical school, she should remain.

=== Argument and deliberation ===

Oral argument in &quot;Bakke&quot; took place on October 12, 1977. There was intense public interest in the case; prospective attendees began to line up the afternoon before. The court session took two hours, with Cox arguing for the university, Colvin for Bakke, and Solicitor General Wade H. McCree for the United States. Colvin was admonished by Justice Lewis Franklin Powell for arguing the facts, rather than the Constitution. Cox provided one of the few moments of levity during the argument when Justice Harry A. Blackmun wondered whether the set-aside seats could be compared to athletic scholarships. Cox was willing to agree but noted that he was a Harvard graduate, and as for sporting success, &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s our aim, but we don&#x27;t do very well.&quot;

Deliberation began with the justices lobbying each other through written memorandum. At a conference held among justices on October 15, 1977, they decided to request further briefing from the parties on the applicability of Title VI. The supplemental brief for the university was filed on November 16, and argued that Title VI was a statutory version of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and did not allow private plaintiffs, such as Bakke, to pursue a claim under it. Bakke&#x27;s brief, submitted by Colvin, claimed that Bakke did have a private right of action and that his client did not want the university to suffer the remedy prescribed under Title VI for discriminatory institutions, that is the loss of federal funding, and that he wanted to be admitted to the medical school.

In November, Justice Blackmun absented himself to have prostate surgery at the Mayo Clinic. On November 22, Justice Lewis Powell submitted a memo that analyzed the university&#x27;s minority admissions program under the strict scrutiny standard which is often applied when the government treats some citizens differently based on a suspect classification such as race. He concluded that the program did not meet the standard and must be struck down. Powell&#x27;s memorandum stated that affirmative action was permissible under some circumstances; this view eventually formed much of his final opinion.

On December 9, at a conference, with Blackmun still absent, the justices considered the case. Four justices (Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, and Justices Potter Stewart, Rehnquist, and John Paul Stevens) favored affirming the California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision. Three justices (Brennan, White, and Thurgood Marshall) wanted to uphold the program. Powell stated his views, after which Brennan, hoping to cobble together a five-justice majority to support the program, or at least to support the general principle of affirmative action, suggested to Powell that applying Powell&#x27;s standard meant that the lower court decision would be affirmed in part and reversed in part. Powell agreed.

When Blackmun returned in early 1978. he was slow to make his position on &quot;Bakke&quot; known. On May 1, he circulated a memorandum to his colleagues indicating that he would join Brennan&#x27;s bloc in support of affirmative action and the university&#x27;s program. This meant that Powell&#x27;s vote would decide the majority opinion. Over the following eight weeks, Powell fine-tuned his opinion to secure the willingness of each group to join part of it. The other justices began work on opinions that would set forth their views.

=== Decision ===

The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bakke&quot; was announced on June 28, 1978. The justices penned six opinions; none of them, in full, had the support of a majority of the court. In a plurality opinion, Justice Powell delivered the judgment of the court. Four justices (Burger, Stewart, Rehnquist, and Stevens) joined with him to strike down the minority admissions program and admit Bakke. The other four justices (Brennan, White, Marshall, and Blackmun) dissented from that portion of the decision, but joined with Powell to find affirmative action permissible under some circumstances, though subject to an intermediate scrutiny standard of analysis. They also joined with Powell to reverse that portion of the judgment of the California Supreme Court that forbade the university to consider race in the admissions process.

==== Powell&#x27;s opinion ====
Justice Powell based a significant portion of his diversity rationale in the decision on the First Amendment, which has been significantly emphasized by later scholars. Justice Powell, after setting forth the facts of the case, discussed and found it unnecessary to decide whether Bakke had a private right of action under Title VI, assuming that was so for purposes of the case. He then discussed the scope of Title VI, opining that it barred only those racial classifications forbidden by the Constitution.

Turning to the program itself, Powell determined that it was not simply a goal, as the university had contended, but a racial qualification—assuming that UC Davis could find sixteen minimally qualified minority students, there were only 84 seats in the freshman class open to white students, whereas minorities could compete for any spot in the 100-member class. He traced the history of the jurisprudence under the Equal Protection Clause, and concluded that it protected all, not merely African Americans or only minorities. Only if it served a compelling interest could the government treat members of different races differently.

Powell noted that the university, in its briefs, had cited decisions where there had been race-conscious remedies, such as in the school desegregation cases, but found them inapposite as there was no history of racial discrimination at the University of California-Davis Medical School to remedy. He cited precedent that when an individual was entirely foreclosed from opportunities or benefits provided by the government and enjoyed by those of a different background or race, this was a suspect classification. Such discrimination was only justifiable when necessary to a compelling governmental interest. He rejected assertions by the university that government had a compelling interest in boosting the number of minority doctors, and deemed too nebulous the argument that the special admissions program would help bring doctors to underserved parts of California—after all, that purpose would also be served by admitting white applicants interested in practicing in minority communities. Nevertheless, Powell opined that government had a compelling interest in a racially diverse student body.

In a part of the opinion concurred in by Chief Justice Burger and his allies, Powell found that the program, with its set-aside of a specific number of seats for minorities, did discriminate against Bakke, as less restrictive programs, such as making race one of several factors in admission, would serve the same purpose. Powell offered the example (set out in an appendix) of the admissions program at Harvard University as one he believed would pass constitutional muster—that institution did not set rigid quotas for minorities, but actively recruited them and sought to include them as more than a token part of a racially and culturally diverse student body. Although a white student might still lose out to a minority with lesser academic qualifications, both white and minority students might gain from non-objective factors such as the ability to play sports or a musical instrument. Accordingly, there was no constitutional violation in using race as one of several factors.

Powell opined that, because the university had admitted that it could not prove that Bakke would not have been admitted even had there been no special admissions program, the portion of the California Supreme Court&#x27;s decision ordering Bakke&#x27;s admission was proper, and was upheld. Nevertheless, the state was entitled to consider race as one of several factors, and the portion of the California court&#x27;s judgment that had ordered the contrary was overruled.

==== Other opinions ====
Brennan delivered the joint statement of four justices: Marshall, White, Blackmun and himself. In verbally introducing their opinion in the Supreme Court courtroom, Brennan stated that the &quot;central meaning&quot; of the &quot;Bakke&quot; decision was that there was a majority of the court in favor of the continuation of affirmative action. In the joint opinion, those four justices wrote, &quot;government may take race into account when it acts not to demean or insult any racial group, but to remedy disadvantages cast on minorities by past racial prejudice&quot;. They suggested that any admissions program with the intention of remedying past race discrimination would be constitutional, whether that involved adding bonus points for race, or setting aside a specific number of places for them.

White issued an opinion expressing his view that there was not a private right of action under Title VI. Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, recounting at length the history of discrimination against African Americans, and concluding, &quot;I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America&#x27;s past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible.&quot; Blackmun subscribed to the idea of color consciousness, declaring that, &quot;in order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race. There is no other way. And in order to treat some persons equally, we must treat them differently. We cannot—we dare not—let the Equal Protection Clause perpetuate racial superiority.&quot;

Justice Stevens, joined by Burger, Stewart and Rehnquist, concurring in part and dissenting in part in the judgment, found it unnecessary to determine whether a racial preference was ever allowed under the Constitution. A narrow finding that the university had discriminated against Bakke, violating Title VI, was sufficient, and the court was correct to admit him. &quot;It is therefore perfectly clear that the question whether race can ever be used as a factor in an admissions decision is not an issue in this case, and that discussion of that issue is inappropriate.&quot; According to Stevens, &quot;[t]he meaning of the Title VI ban on exclusion is crystal clear: Race cannot be the basis of excluding anyone from a federally funded program&quot;. He concluded, &quot;I concur in the Court&#x27;s judgment insofar as it affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court of California. To the extent that it purports to do anything else, I respectfully dissent.&quot;

== Reaction ==
Newspapers stressed different aspects of &quot;Bakke&quot;, often reflecting their political ideology. The conservative &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; bannered Bakke&#x27;s admission in its headline, while noting that the court had permitted affirmative action under some circumstances. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, a liberal newspaper, began its headline in larger-than-normal type, &quot;Affirmative Action Upheld&quot; before going on to note that the court had admitted Bakke and curbed quotas. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, in a headline, deemed &quot;Bakke&quot; &quot;The Decision Everybody Won&quot;. According to Oxford University Chair of Jurisprudence Ronald Dworkin, the court&#x27;s decision &quot;was received by the press and much of the public with great relief, as an act of judicial statesmanship that gave to each party in the national debate what it seemed to want most&quot;.

Attorney General Griffin Bell, after speaking with President Jimmy Carter, stated, &quot;my general view is that affirmative action has been enhanced&quot;, and that such programs in the federal government would continue as planned. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chair Eleanor Holmes Norton told the media &quot;that the &quot;Bakke&quot; case has not left me with any duty to instruct the EEOC staff to do anything different&quot;.

Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe wrote in 1979, &quot;the Court thus upheld the kind of affirmative action plan used by most American colleges and universities, and disallowed only the unusually mechanical—some would say unusually candid, others would say unusually impolitic—approach taken by the Medical School&quot; of UC Davis. Robert M. O&#x27;Neil wrote in the &quot;California Law Review&quot; the same year that only rigid quotas were foreclosed to admissions officers and even &quot;relatively subtle changes in the process by which applications were reviewed, or in the resulting minority representation, could well produce a different alignment [of justices]&quot;. Law professor and future judge Robert Bork wrote in the pages of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that the justices who had voted to uphold affirmative action were &quot;hard-core racists of reverse discrimination&quot;.

Allan Bakke had given few interviews during the pendency of the case, and, on the day it was decided, went to work as usual in Palo Alto. He issued a statement through attorney Colvin expressing his pleasure in the result and that he planned to begin his medical studies that fall. Most of the lawyers and university personnel who would have to deal with the aftermath of &quot;Bakke&quot; doubted the decision would change very much. The large majority of affirmative action programs at universities, unlike that of the UC Davis medical school, did not use rigid numerical quotas for minority admissions and could continue. According to Bernard Schwartz in his account of &quot;Bakke&quot;, the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision &quot;permits admission officers to operate programs which grant racial preferences—provided that they do not do so as blatantly as was done under the sixteen-seat &#x27;quota&#x27; provided at Davis&quot;.

== Aftermath ==
Allan Bakke, &quot;America&#x27;s best known freshman&quot;, enrolled at the UC Davis medical school on September 25, 1978. Seemingly oblivious to the questions of the press and the shouts of protesters, he stated only &quot;I am happy to be here&quot; before entering to register. When the university declined to pay his legal fees, Bakke went to court, and on January 15, 1980, was awarded $183,089. Graduating from the UC Davis medical school in 1982 at age 42, he went on to a career as an anesthesiologist at the Mayo Clinic and at the Olmsted Medical Group in Rochester, Minnesota.

In 1996, Californians by initiative banned the state&#x27;s use of race as a factor to consider in public schools&#x27; admission policies. The university&#x27;s Board of Regents, led by Ward Connerly, voted to end race as a factor in admissions. The regents, to secure a diverse student body, implemented policies such as allowing the top 4% of students in California high schools guaranteed admission to the University of California System—which, it was felt, would aid minority inner-city students.

Dworkin warned in 1978 that &quot;Powell&#x27;s opinion suffers from fundamental weaknesses, and if the Court is to arrive at a coherent position, far more judicial work remains to be done than a relieved public yet realizes&quot;. The Supreme Court continued to grapple with the question of affirmative action in higher education. In the 2003 case of &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;, it reaffirmed Justice Powell&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Bakke&quot; in a majority opinion, thus rendering moot concerns expressed by lower courts that &quot;Bakke&quot; might not be binding precedent due to the fractured lineup of justices in a plurality opinion. The court&#x27;s decision in the 2013 case of &quot;Fisher v. University of Texas&quot; made alterations to the standards by which courts must judge affirmative action programs, but continued to permit race to be taken into consideration in university admissions, while forbidding outright quotas. In 2023, the Court, in &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&quot; and &quot;Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina&quot;, reversed its former position, holding that considering race in college admissions violated the Fourteenth Amendment.

The admission to medical school of Patrick Chavis, one of the black doctors admitted under the medical school&#x27;s affirmative action program instead of Bakke, was widely praised by many notable parties, including Ted Kennedy, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Nation&quot;. As an actual medical doctor, Chavis practiced for 15 years as an Ob/Gyn. In the early 90s, he turned to cosmetic surgery, primarily liposuction. At this point, he underwent a deterioration and became incompetent and negligent. In 1997, his medical license was revoked. Chavis was widely cited by both the supporters, and the opponents, of affirmative action, as a real world example of why they held their respective beliefs.

<doc id="169484" wikidata="Q724283" url="?curid=169484" title="Essen, Belgium">
<text>Essen () is a town and municipality in the Belgian province of Antwerp, notable for being bordered by the Netherlands on three sides. As of September 2022, it has a population of 19,029 residents. The town belongs to both the electoral canton of Brecht and the judicial canton of Kapellen and is situated in the region of Noorderkempen.

== Toponymy ==
The name &quot;Essen&quot; has historical variations, including &quot;Esshen,&quot; &quot;Essche(n),&quot; and &quot;Esse.&quot; These names are believed to refer to elevated fields near a watercourse or to settlements situated along a stream. An additional etymological connection exists with the ash tree, known as &quot;es&quot; in Dutch. The ash tree was historically used in shipbuilding, which might explain the name&#x27;s Old Dutch meaning of &#x27;boat of ash wood.&#x27;

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Essen has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Finds from four different sites indicate that around 8,500 years ago, nomadic tribes roamed the region, making tools like flint arrowheads. However, the limited number of sites makes it difficult to draw broader conclusions.

=== Abbey of Tongerlo ===
In 1159, Berner van Rijsbergen granted Essen as an allodium to Tongerlo Abbey. The abbey shared lordship rights with the Dukes of Brabant. Essen, along with Kalmthout and Huijbergen, formed one seigniory under the abbey&#x27;s rule until the French Revolution.

=== Lootings ===
Essen didn&#x27;t escape the chaos of the 16th century; it was sacked twice—first by Maarten van Rossum&#x27;s troops in 1542 and then by Marshal Armand de Gontaut-Biron&#x27;s forces in 1583.

=== Border community and coat of arms ===
After gaining independence in 1795, Essen adopted the coat of arms of Prelate Hermans, the last abbot of Tongerlo. The symbols on the coat of arms—two ox heads and a lamb—reflect both the town&#x27;s agricultural heritage and its virtues of steadfastness and patience. In 1802, Essen became an independent parish, having previously been part of the parish of Nispen.

==== Belgian Revolution ====
After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Essen became part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, under the rule of William I of Orange-Nassau. However, when the Southern Netherlands seceded to form present-day Belgium in 1830, Essen&#x27;s geopolitical status shifted, turning it into a border town. This transition was marked by significant military conflict, most notably the Battle of Essen on 21 November 1830, during the Belgian War of Independence. In the years following the secession, Walloon soldiers were stationed to guard the newly established border. Tensions escalated further on 20 November 1831, when these soldiers moved to Roosendaal, inciting a strong Dutch military response the following day. During a high mass, 4,000 Dutch soldiers entered and searched Essen, resulting in the death of five soldiers and two villagers. This event is known as the Battle of the Hill.

=== Economy ===
In an agreement signed on 9 July 1852, Belgium and the Netherlands paved the way for a new railroad connecting Antwerp and Rotterdam. Constructed between 1852 and 1854, the Antwerp-Lage Zwaluwe rail line included a key border station in Essen. Interestingly, the line bypassed the city of Breda, a decision influenced by one of the founding members of the Société Anonyme des chemins de fer d&#x27;Anvers à Rotterdam, who owned land in Essen. This new transit route attracted affluent residents from Antwerp seeking tranquility, while also facilitating easier access to educational and employment opportunities in Antwerp for the local populace.

Essen Railway Station has historically been the final Belgian stop before the Dutch border, serving as a significant border checkpoint between the two countries. The station&#x27;s multiple adjustment tracks are vestiges of its role in border control. The introduction of the railway accelerated Essen&#x27;s development, creating numerous job opportunities and establishing the station as a mandatory stop for international trains. In the contemporary setting, the station offers an Intercity (IC) connection to Antwerp and Brussels-Midi, along with a local train service to Roosendaal.

Further adding to its historical significance, the border station has housed quarantine stables since 1896. These were primarily used to isolate cattle and assess them for contagious diseases, a practice that continued until the 1970s. Recognizing their historical value, the Quarantine Stables received legal protection as a monument in 1994.

=== WW I ===
During the First World War, Essen found itself isolated from the outside world. German forces, opting not to encircle the town&#x27;s geographically protruding &quot;hump&quot; with barbed wire, instead installed what came to be known as the &quot;Wire of Death.&quot; This deadly barrier is commemorated in numerous artworks displayed in both Essen and neighboring Kalmthout. Meanwhile, the Netherlands, maintaining its neutrality, erected similar barriers on the remaining border stretches. Despite this isolation, smuggling activities thrived in the area.

=== WW II ===
The end of the Second World War saw German forces leaving a swath of destruction in their wake. Notably, several churches and their towers, such as O.-L.-V. Geboortekerk in Essen-Centre, Sint-Jan-Baptistkerk in Wildert, and Sint-Vincentius-à-Paulokerk in Horendonk, were demolished. These had been considered strategic vantage points. Only a few places of worship, including the Eucharistic Heart Church at College, St. Anthony of Padua Church at Essen-Statie, and St. Peter&#x27;s Church at Hoek, were spared. Moreover, the town suffered from misplaced V1 and V2 rocket attacks, originally aimed at the port of Antwerp.

=== Post-war history ===
In 1959, a new customs office rose on Nieuwstraat, the very site where the O.-L.-V. Geboortekerk (Church of the Nativity) once stood before its destruction in World War II. Essen claimed the title of second-busiest road office on the Belgian-Dutch border, right behind Wuustwezel, until it shuttered on 1 January 1993.

Since 1976, Essen has maintained civic ties with Essen in Oldenburg, Germany.

The landscape of local governance saw a shake-up in 1977. Municipal borders and territories were rationalized, culminating in the formation of Essen-Hoek. Although Hoek had been around for centuries, it was fragmented into Kalmthoutsehoek and Essen-Hoek (also known as Moerkant). Given that the parish of Hoek had already existed for 150 years, this administrative unification served more as a formality than a revolution.

== Geography ==
Essen holds the distinction of being Belgium&#x27;s third most northern municipality, flanked by the municipality of Kalmthout and the Dutch border. This unique geographic status, shared only with Momignies, means Essen borders just one other Belgian municipality. The rest of its neighbors are Dutch. Geographically, Essen&#x27;s shape resembles a &quot;hump,&quot; positioning it as the most northwestern municipality in the Kempen region and the northernmost in Noorderkempen.

=== Towns / Districts ===
Essen is devoid of formal boroughs but is rich in neighborhoods and hamlets. The village center, known as &quot;Essen-Centre,&quot; serves as the heart of the municipality. Adjacent to the west lies the district of Heikant, followed by the rural residential ribbon of Essen-Hoek. Horendonk sits to the east of the center, while Wildert nestles to the south. Statie district resides west of the center.

The 1977 municipal redistribution granted Essen a portion of Kalmthoutse Hoek, which was then integrated into Essen-Hoek.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
Essen is subdivided into two major districts: Essen-Centre and Essen-Statie. These districts are further divided into a tapestry of neighborhoods, including De Heuvel, De Donk, Spijker, Zandstraat, Werf, Bredestraat, Schanker, Schriek, Steenpaal, Vennen, Schildershof, Hemelrijk, Statievelden, and Hondsberg.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
North: Roosendaal (NL), Ruchphen (NL)

East: Zundert (NL)

South: Kalmthout (BE)

West: Woensdrecht (NL)

== Landmarks ==

* de Kiekenhoeve, an old farm from 1776 close to the Wheelbarrow museum in the Moerkantsebaan
* the Quarantine Stables where until the 1970s mainly cattle were placed in isolation via a special unloading quay to check the animals for contagious diseases, located in the Hemelrijk
* Essen railway station
* the old SNCB goods shed, close to Essen Railway station
* some mansions in the Nieuwstraat
* the old presbytery, which was the residence of the priests of Essen-Nispen for 500 years. The first mention of the Old Rectory dates back to 1362. It now serves as a cultural centre. Both in 1422 and in 1557 the pastor was murdered there. After its destruction in 1586, it was rebuilt under the leadership of Abbot Piera. His coat of arms was affixed above the door. What remains today is only a quarter of what it once was.

Legislature 2001 - 2006

A coalition was formed between CVP and VLD. The mayor was Frans Schrauwen.

Legislature 2007 - 2012

The previous coalition was rejected by the voters. A coalition was made between CD&amp;V and sp.a. The latter party made an explicit condition to end Schrauwen&#x27;s mandate as mayor.

Legislature 2013 - 2018

The mayor is Gaston Van Tichelt (CD&amp;V). He leads a coalition consisting of CD&amp;V and sp.a. Together they form the majority with 14 out of 25 seats.

Legislature 2019 - 2024

In the municipal elections of October 2018, there were some changes regarding the emerging parties. Open VLD and Piratenpartij did not emerge anymore and some members of Vlaams Belang tore off from their party and these emerged under the name &quot;Essen&#x27;s Belang&quot;.

The cartel party N-VA/PLE became the largest party by two votes over CD&amp;V and the cartel went up 4.7%. As a result, N-VA/PLE gained one more seat than in the previous election and obtained one more seat than CD&amp;V, which lost one seat. CD&amp;V and N-VA/PLE obtained the same percentage of votes, namely 34.7%. sp.a retained its four seats . Vlaams Belang obtained two seats, one more than in the previous election. Essen&#x27;s Belang did not exceed the electoral threshold.

The previous Roman-red coalition CD&amp;V-sp.a was continued with a majority of 13 to 25 seats and N-VA/PLE ended up in the opposition. Gaston Van Tichelt again became mayor.

<doc id="169486" wikidata="Q27392" url="?curid=169486" title="Bristol Cars">
<text>Bristol Cars was a British manufacturer of hand-built luxury cars headquartered in Bristol, England. It was formed from the car division of the Bristol Aeroplane Company after the Second World War and later became independent as Bristol Cars Limited. After being placed in receivership and being taken over in 2011, it entered liquidation in February 2020.

Bristol was always a low-volume manufacturer; the most recent published official production figures were for 1982, which stated that 104 cars were produced in that year. The company also had only one sales showroom, on the corner of Kensington High Street and Holland Road in London.

The company suspended manufacturing in March 2011, when administrators were appointed, 22 staff were made redundant at the factory in Filton, Bristol and subsequently the company was dissolved. In April 2011, a new company was formed by the administrator to sell the original assets to Kamkorp. The new company was liquidated in 2020 in order to pay creditors.

==History==

The British aircraft industry suffered a dramatic loss of orders and great financial difficulties following the Armistice of 1918. To provide immediate employment for its considerable workforce, the Bristol Aeroplane Company undertook the manufacture of a light car (the single-seat Bristol Monocar, powered by a motorcycle engine) and the construction of car bodies for Armstrong Siddeley, alongside bus bodies for their sister company, Bristol Tramways.

On the outbreak of World War II, Sir Stanley White, managing director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company from 1911 to 1954, was determined not to suffer the same difficulties a second time. The company now employed 70,000 and he knew he must plan for the time when the wartime demand for Bristol aircraft and aircraft engines would suddenly end. The company began working with AFN Ltd, manufacturers of Frazer Nash cars and British importer of BMWs before the war, on plans for a joint venture in automotive manufacture.
As early as 1941, a number of papers were written or commissioned by Sir George White, Sir Stanley&#x27;s son, proposing a post-war car manufacturing division. It was decided to purchase an existing manufacturer for this purpose. Alvis, Aston Martin, Lagonda, ERA and Lea-Francis were considered.

===Beginning===
In May 1945, a chance discussion took place between D. A. Aldington, a director of Frazer Nash then serving as an inspector for the wartime Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP), and Eric Storey, an assistant of George White at the Bristol Aeroplane Company. It led to the immediate take-over of Frazer Nash by the aeroplane company.

Aldington and his two brothers had marketed the Frazer Nash BMW before the war, and proposed to build an updated version after demobilisation. This seemed the perfect match for the aeroplane company&#x27;s own ambitions to manufacture a high quality sports car. With the support of the War Reparations Board, H. J. Aldington travelled to Munich and purchased the rights to manufacture three BMW models and the 328 engine.

By July 1945, BAC had created a car division and bought a controlling stake in AFN. A factory was established at Filton Aerodrome, near Bristol. 

George White and Reginald Verdon-Smith of the aeroplane company joined the new Frazer Nash Board, but in January 1947, soon after the first cars had been produced, differences between the Aldingtons and Bristol led to the resale of Frazer Nash. The Bristol car division became an independent entity.

===Independence===
Bristol Cars was sold after its parent joined with other British aircraft companies in 1960 to create the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC), which later became part of British Aerospace.

The car division originally merged with Bristol Siddeley Engines, and was marked for closure, but was bought in September 1960 by George White, the chairman and effective founder. White retained the direction of the company, but sold a forty per cent shareholding to Tony Crook, a leading Bristol agent. Crook then became sole distributor.

===New ownership===
In September 1969, only a month before the unveiling of the new Bristol 411 at the Earl&#x27;s Court Motor Show, Sir George White (as he had become) suffered a serious accident in his Bristol 410. The car was only superficially damaged, but he suffered severe trauma.

As time passed it became clear that he would never regain his health sufficiently to return to full-time work. To safeguard the future of his workforce, he decided in 1973 to sell his majority shareholding to Crook. As the ties with the White family were severed, British Aerospace requested the company to move its factory from Filton Aerodrome and it found new premises in nearby Patchway. The showroom on Kensington High Street became the head office, with Crook shuttling between the two in Bristol&#x27;s light aircraft.

Under Crook&#x27;s direction the company produced at least six types, the names of which were largely borrowed from Bristol&#x27;s aeronautical past: the Beaufighter, Blenheim, Britannia and Brigand.

===End of the second era===
In February 1997, Crook, then aged 77, sold a fifty per cent holding in Bristol Cars to Toby Silverton, with an option to take full control within four years. Silverton, then son-in-law of Joe Lewis of the Tavistock Group and son of Arthur Silverton of Overfinch, joined the board with his father.

Crook and Toby Silverton produced the Speedster, Bullet, Blenheim and 411 Series 6, though 2002 saw the transfer of Bristol Cars fully into the ownership of Silverton and the Tavistock Group, with Silverton in the chair and Crook remaining as managing director. Together they developed a V10 engined two-seater named after the first Sir George White&#x27;s First World War two-seater aircraft, the Bristol Fighter. Crook finally relinquished his connection with Bristol Cars in August 2007.

=== Kamkorp era (2011–2020) ===
On 3 March 2011 it was announced that Bristol Cars had gone into administration, with the loss of 22 jobs when the factory at Filton, Bristol was shut down. On 21 April 2011 another new company was formed to sell the assets of the former dissolved company; that company was purchased by Kamkorp, which also owned Frazer-Nash Research, a technology manufacturer of electric power systems. During this era, the company focused on restoring and selling all models of the marque while a new model was being developed.

In 2015 Bristol Cars announced the development of a new model codenamed &quot;Project Pinnacle&quot;. Initial reports indicated it would be a petrol-electric hybrid with a petrol engine from BMW. However a later media report and a May 2015 press release, indicated that the car would have non-hybrid V8 power. The car, a two-seater roadster, made its first public appearance, slightly camouflaged, at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in June 2016. In July, the car was shown undisguised, technical details were announced, and its name given as the Bristol Bullet. However, subsequently there was no further news about the car&#x27;s homologation, and many members of the sales and marketing team soon left the company. The Bullet was said to be powered by a normally aspirated 4.8-litre BMW N62 V8 engine (sharing the same drivetrain and chassis as the most recent Morgan Aero 8) driving the rear wheels, had a body of carbon fibre, weighed 1130 kg, and would cost £95,000. The planned production run was said to be limited to 70 cars to commemorate the marque&#x27;s 70th anniversary.

On 5 March 2020 it was reported that Bristol cars had been officially wound up in order to pay creditors, with court-ordered liquidation under way. The Bristol Owners Club working together with the Bristol Owners and Drivers Association and the Bristol Owners Heritage Trust is reported to be actively engaged in order to preserve the heritage and associated spares for the marque.

=== Post liquidation (since 2021) ===
In 2021, intellectual property rights to Bristol Cars were registered by Bristol Fighter Limited, a subsidiary of Bristol Manufacturing Limited, owned by Essex based investor and property developer Jason Wharton, with revocation of 297 defunct trademarks. Wharton plans to transform the company into a &quot;leading British electric vehicle company&quot; by 2026, the brand&#x27;s 80th anniversary. The new Bristol Cars would firstly launch &quot;remastered&quot; versions of historic cars with modernised mechanicals on a built to order basis. It was also reported that the new company will subsequently revive the Buccaneer nameplate for an all new electric vehicle. Shortly after this announcement, however, controversy erupted between Wharton and Bristol&#x27;s insolvency practitioner Frost Group. The practitioner stated that Wharton had in fact not purchased any intellectual property rights, but had merely purchased certain tooling and spares at the auction of the company&#x27;s assets. Despite this controversy, plans to revive the brand continued and Wharton announced in 2024 that Bristol would be revived as a contemporary coachbuilder by 2026.

==Pre-war BMW designs, Aldington brothers and early cars==

HJ Aldington, a director of the Bristol Aeroplane Company affiliated AFN (BMW&#x27;s pre-war concessionaire in the UK), used his British Army connections to visit the bombed BMW factory in Munich several times post-war. In 1945 he took plans for BMW cars back to Britain, and BMW chief engineer, Dr. Fritz Fiedler was also employed. Its first car was the Bristol 400, prototyped in 1946 and introduced at the 1947 Geneva Motor Show. Derived from immediately pre-WW2 BMW products (thanks to a connection to BMW through Frazer Nash), the chassis was based on the BMW 326, the engine on the 328, and the body on the 327. Even a variation on the famous double-kidney BMW grille was retained. Bristol, however, did a thorough examination of the car&#x27;s handling and ended up with performance &quot;only matched by outright purpose-built competition cars&quot;. Seven hundred of the Bristol 400 were built, 17 of which received &quot;handsome&quot; drophead bodywork from Pininfarina.

In 1949, the 400 was joined by the five-place 401. Bodied by Touring, it was aerodynamically sleeker, accelerated better, and had higher top speed. It was joined by the drophead 402, of which just 24 examples were built.

The 403 followed in 1953, which featured improved brakes, gearbox, dampers, heater, and engine (a detuned racing motor, in fact). Bristol would use this same engine in the 450, entered at Le Mans in 1953; it broke its experimental crankshaft, but despite being less than aerodynamically ideal proved fully five seconds a lap quicker than the competition. Bristol withdrew from racing two years later.

Along with the 403 was the 404, on a shorter wheelbase, with a more powerful engine and styling reminiscent of the 450. The 404 introduced a concealed front wing-mounted spare wheel and battery. It was built to extremely exacting standards, and the price reflected it; this, plus newly introduced &quot;punitive taxation&quot;, meant only 40 were produced.
The 405, which entered production in 1954, was much more successful, not least for being Bristol&#x27;s only four-door. It remained in production until 1958, with 297 saloons and 43 drophead coupés produced in all.

Bristol debuted the 406 in 1958, and it remained in production until 1961.

===V8 cars===
The 406&#x27;s replacement, the 407, was powered by a 5.2-litre V8 provided by Chrysler of Canada.

It was followed in 1963 by the 408, with drastic restyling as well as improved suspension. This was succeeded by the 409. Many buyers preferred the crisp steering and gearbox of the earlier six-cylinder cars.

The 410, introduced in 1966, was a return to the high-performance touring tradition, offering the same top speed as the 409, and superior acceleration, with the same powerplant. It also saw Bristol become a private company and marked a return to quality to the exclusion of output: no more than three cars a week were to be made.
In 1969, the Bristol 411 appeared, with a new 6.2-litre Chrysler V8 (still rebuilt and modified by Bristol, as before) delivering higher top speed and even better acceleration.
===Engines===
Until 1961 all Bristol cars used Bristol-built derivatives of the BMW M328 2-litre six-cylinder engine. These engines also powered a number of sports and racing cars, including all post-war Frazer Nashes (apart from a few prototypes), some ACs, some Lotus and Cooper racing cars, and several others.

In 1961, with the launch of the Bristol 407, the company switched to larger Chrysler V8 engines, which were more powerful than Bristol&#x27;s own, BMW derived 2.25-litre 6 cylinder engine. The Chrysler V8s could be bought off the shelf from Canadian Chrysler without the startup costs of Bristol&#x27;s own 3.65-litre all alloy 6 then in development. All post-1961 Bristols, including the later Blenheim and Fighter models, used Chrysler engines.

<text>The European Union Police Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (EUPM) was the European Union&#x27;s mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina that aided the local police organizations, and was one of a number of European Union Police Missions worldwide. It was the first such mission undertaken by the EU within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EUPM was the successor to the United Nations International Police Task Force (part of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina) in Bosnia, whose term ended at the end of 2002.

The EUPM acted under co-ordination of the European Union Special Representative, who also served as High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The mission was ended on 30 June 2012.

==Mission==
The EUPM aimed to help in establishing a sustainable, professional and multi-ethnic police force. It assisted the local police, fighting large-scale organised crime and helping with police reform.

EUPM, the first mission launched under the Common Security and Defence Policy, was launched on 1 January 2003 for an initial period of three years. Following an invitation by the Bosnian authorities, the EU decided to establish a follow-on police mission with a modified mandate and size. EUPM II lasted for two years (from 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2007). It monitored, advised and inspected BiH police forces according to three main pillars, i.e. support to the police reform process, strengthening of police accountability and supporting the fight against organised crime.

At the end of 2007 the EU Police Mission was extended for another two years (from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2009). During those two years, the mission continued its work with regard to the three same pillars, with particular emphasis on the fight against organised crime. EUPM also devoted particular attention to reinforcing cooperation between police and prosecutors.

<text>Popular monarchy is a term used by Kingsley Martin (1936) for monarchical titles referring to a people rather than a territory. 
This was the norm in classical antiquity and throughout much of the Middle Ages, and such titles were retained in some of the monarchies of 19th- and 20th-century Europe.

During the French Revolution, Louis XVI had to change his title to indicate he was &quot;king of the French&quot; rather than &quot;king of France&quot;, paralleling the title of &quot;king of the Franks&quot; (&quot;rex Francorum&quot;) used in medieval France.

Currently, Belgium has the only explicit popular monarchy, the formal title of its king being &quot;King of the Belgians&quot; rather than &quot;King of Belgium&quot;.

<doc id="169491" wikidata="Q1239030" url="?curid=169491" title="Don Camillo and Peppone">
<text>Don Camillo () and Peppone () are the fictional protagonists of a series of works by the Italian writer and journalist Giovannino Guareschi set in what Guareschi refers to as the &quot;small world&quot; of rural Italy after World War II. Most of the Don Camillo stories came out in the weekly magazine &quot;Candido&quot;, founded by Guareschi with Giovanni Mosca. These &quot;Little World&quot; (Italian: &quot;Piccolo Mondo&quot;) stories amounted to 347 in total and were put together and published in eight books, only the first three of which were published when Guareschi was still alive.

Don Camillo is a parish priest and is said to have been inspired by an actual Roman Catholic priest, World War II partisan and detainee at the concentration camps of Dachau and Mauthausen, named Don Camillo Valota (1912–1998). Guareschi was also inspired by Don Alessandro Parenti, a priest of Trepalle, near the Swiss border. Peppone is the communist town mayor. The tensions between the two characters and their respective factions form the basis of the works&#x27; satirical plots.

==Characterisation==
In the post-war years (after 1945), Don Camillo Tarocci (his full name, which he rarely uses) is the hotheaded priest of a small town in the Po valley in northern Italy. He is a big man, tall and strong with hard fists. For the films, the town chosen to represent that of the books was Brescello (which currently has a museum dedicated to Don Camillo and Peppone) after the production of movies based on Guareschi&#x27;s tales, but in the first story Don Camillo is introduced as the parish priest of Ponteratto.

Don Camillo is constantly at odds with the Communist mayor, Giuseppe Bottazzi, better known as Peppone (meaning, roughly, &#x27;Big Joe&#x27;, an allusion to Josef Stalin) and is also on very close terms with the crucifix in his town church. Through the crucifix he hears the voice of Christ. The Christ in the crucifix often has far greater understanding than Don Camillo of the troubles of the people, and has to constantly but gently reprimand the priest for his impatience.

What Peppone and Camillo have in common is an interest in the well-being of the town. They also appear to have both been partisan fighters during World War II; one episode mentions Camillo having braved German patrols in order to reach Peppone and his fellow Communists in the mountains and administer Mass to them under field conditions. While Peppone makes public speeches about how &quot;the reactionaries&quot; ought to be shot, and Don Camillo preaches fire and brimstone against &quot;godless Communists&quot;, they actually grudgingly admire each other. Therefore, they sometimes end up working together in peculiar circumstances, though keeping up their squabbling. Thus, although he publicly opposes the Church as a Party duty, Peppone takes his gang to the church and baptises his children there, which makes him part of Don Camillo&#x27;s flock; also, Peppone and other Communists are seen as sharing in veneration of the Virgin Mary and local Saints. Don Camillo also never condemns Peppone himself, but the ideology of communism which is in direct opposition to the church.

Peppone and his comrades are sometimes seen at odds with the city-based Communist bureaucrats, who are sometimes seen as &quot;barging in&quot; and trying to dictate policy to the local Communists without knowing the local conditions. This is paralleled by Don Camillo sometimes coming into serious conflict with his Bishop, on one occasion a case of flagrant disobedience leading to Camillo being exiled to a tiny village high in the mountains; however, the Bishop is soon forced to reinstate him at the strong demand of his parishioners (including the Communists). 

As depicted in the stories, the Communists are the only political party with a mass grassroots organization in the town. The Italian Christian Democratic Party, the main force in Italian politics at the time, does not have a local political organization (at least, none is ever mentioned); rather, it is the Catholic Church which unofficially but very obviously plays that role. Don Camillo thus plays an explicitly political as well as religious role. For example, when the Communists organize a local campaign to sign the Stockholm Peace Appeal, it is Don Camillo who organizes a counter-campaign, and the townspeople take for granted that such a political campaign is part of his work as priest.

Many stories are satirical and take on the real world political divide between the Italian Roman Catholic Church and the Italian Communist Party, not to mention other worldly politics. Others are tragedies about schism, politically motivated murder, and personal vendettas in a small town where everyone knows everyone else, but not everyone necessarily likes everyone else very much.

Political forces other than the Communists and the Catholics have only a marginal presence. In one episode the local Communists are incensed at the announcement that the small Italian Liberal Party has scheduled an election rally in their town, and mobilize in force to break it up—only to discover virtually no local Liberals have turned up; the Liberal speaker, a middle-aged professor, speaks to a predominantly Communist audience and wins its grudging respect by his courage and determination.

In one story, Don Camillo visits the Soviet Union, pretending to be a comrade. In another, the arrival of pop culture and motorcycles propels Don Camillo into fighting &quot;decadence&quot;, a struggle in which he finds he has his hands full, especially when Christ mainly smiles benevolently on the young rascals. In this later collection, Peppone is the owner of several profitable dealerships, riding the &quot;Boom&quot; years of the 1960s in Italy. He is no longer quite the committed Communist he once was, but he still does not get on with Don Camillo – at least not in public. Don Camillo has his own problems: the Second Vatican Council has brought changes in the Church, and a new assistant priest, who comes to be called Don Chichì, has been foisted upon him to see that Don Camillo moves with the times. Don Camillo, of course, has other ideas.

Despite their bickering, the goodness and generosity of each character can be seen during hard times. They always understand and respect each other when one is in danger, when a flood devastates the town, when death takes a loved one, and in many other situations in which the two &quot;political enemies&quot; show their mutual respect for one another and fight side by side for the same ideals (even if they are each conditioned by their individual public roles in society).

Guareschi created a second series of novels about a similar character, Don Candido, Archbishop of Trebilie (or Trebiglie, literally &quot;three marble balls&quot; or &quot;three billiard balls&quot;). The name of this fictional town is a play on words of Trepalle (literally &quot;three balls&quot;), a real town (near Livigno) whose priest was an acquaintance of Guareschi&#x27;s.

==Media==

===Films===
A series of black-and-white films were made between 1952 and 1965. These were French–Italian coproductions and were simultaneously released in both languages. Don Camillo was played by French actor Fernandel, Peppone by the Italian actor Gino Cervi, quite a Guareschi-lookalike, both tall and bulky with big mustaches. The author of the original stories was involved in the scripts and helped select the main actors. To this day, the films are screened in Europe. The titles were:

*&quot;Little World of Don Camillo&quot; (Italian: &quot;Don Camillo&quot;; French: &quot;Le Petit Monde de don Camillo&quot;)
*&quot;The Return of Don Camillo&quot; (Italian:&quot; Il ritorno di don Camillo&quot;; French: &quot;Le Retour de don Camillo&quot;)
*&quot;Don Camillo&#x27;s Last Round&quot; (Italian: &quot;Don Camillo e l&#x27;onorevole Peppone&quot;; French: &quot;La Grande Bagarre&quot;)
*&quot;Don Camillo: Monsignor&quot; (Italian: &quot;Don Camillo monsignore ma non troppo&quot;; French:&quot; Don Camillo Monseigneur&quot;)
*&quot;Don Camillo in Moscow&quot; (Italian: &quot;Il compagno don Camillo&quot;; French:&quot; Don Camillo en Russie&quot;)

Christian-Jaque began filming the French-Italian film &quot;Don Camillo e i giovani d&#x27;oggi&quot; in 1970 but had to stop filming due to Fernandel&#x27;s falling ill, which resulted in his untimely death. The film was then realized in 1972 by Mario Camerini with Gastone Moschin playing the role of Don Camillo and Lionel Stander as Peppone. A Don Camillo (&quot;The World of Don Camillo&quot;; Italian: &quot;Don Camillo&quot;) film was remade in 1983, an Italian production with Terence Hill directing and also starring as Don Camillo. Colin Blakely performed Peppone in one of his last film roles.

===Radio===
A BBC Radio English-language radio dramatization of &quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot; was broadcast in 2001 starring Alun Armstrong as Don Camillo, John Moffatt as the Bishop, Shaun Prendergast as Peppone and Joss Ackland as God, and rebroadcast in July 2010 on BBC Radio 7.

Four further BBC Radio series of &quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot; were made, with the final series broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in December 2006. Ian Hogg replaced Armstrong as Don Camillo, while Prendergast, Ackland and Moffatt all continued to reprise their roles as Peppone, God and the Bishop respectively. BBC Radio 7 broadcast the second and third series throughout August and September 2010 with the fourth series beginning on 6 October.

===Television===
In 1980, the BBC produced a well-received television series, &quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot;, based on the stories, starring Italian-German actor Mario Adorf as Don Camillo and Englishman Brian Blessed as Peppone. The narrator and Voice of the Christ was Cyril Cusack. Thirteen episodes were screened on BBC 2 at 9pm on Thursday nights from January 8th 1981 to April 2nd 1981. As of 2023, the series has not been rebroadcast or released on DVD/Blu-ray.

In Colombia the stories were adapted into a TV comedy called &quot;Don Camilo&quot;. The Italian Communist era was changed to a Colombian period called &quot;La Violencia&quot; when the Liberal and Conservative parties were fighting to maintain power in Colombia. The comedy was produced from 1987 to 1988 by the now defunct Coestrellas company and produced and directed by Daniel Samper Pizano and Bernando Romero Pereiro. The series starred Carlos Benjumea as Don Camillo (Don Camilo in Colombian Spanish), Hector Rivas as Peppone (Pepón in Colombian Spanish), Luis Fernando Múnera as The Christ Voice, and the actors Diego León Hoyos and Manuel Pachón as Peppone flunkies. The series was broadcast on Mondays at 10:00 pm by Cadena 2 (Señal Institucional now) and rebroadcast by Señal Colombia in 2011 and Canal Uno in 2014.

===Thai novel===
&quot;The Little World of Don Camillo&quot; was adapted by the Thai writer and politician Kukrit Pramoj into his own 1954 novel, &quot;Phai Daeng&quot; (Red Bamboo).

<text>Giovannino Oliviero Giuseppe Guareschi (; 1 May 1908 – 22 July 1968) was an Italian journalist, cartoonist, and humorist whose best known creation is the priest Don Camillo.

==Life and career==
Guareschi was born into a middle-class family in Fontanelle di Roccabianca, in the province of Parma, in 1908. He always joked about the fact that he, a big man, was baptized Giovannino, a name meaning &quot;little John&quot; or &quot;Johnny&quot;. In 1926, his family went bankrupt and he could not continue his studies at the University of Parma. After working at various minor jobs, he started to write for a local newspaper, the &quot;Gazzetta di Parma&quot;. In 1929, he became editor of the satirical magazine &quot;Corriere Emiliano&quot;, and from 1936 to 1943 was the chief editor of a similar magazine called &quot;Bertoldo&quot;.

In 1943, Guareschi was drafted into the army, which apparently helped him to avoid trouble with the Italian Fascist authorities. He ended up as an artillery officer. When Italy signed the armistice of Cassibile with the Allies in 1943, he was arrested as an Italian military internee and imprisoned with other Italian soldiers in camps in German-occupied Poland for almost two years, including at Stalag X-B near Sandbostel. He later wrote about this period in &quot;Diario Clandestino&quot; (&quot;My Secret Diary&quot;).
After the war, Guareschi returned to Italy and in 1945 founded a monarchist weekly satirical magazine, &quot;Candido&quot;. After Italy became a republic, he supported the Christian Democracy party. He criticized and satirized the Italian Communist Party in his magazine, famously drawing a Communist as a man with an extra nostril, and coining a slogan that became very popular: &quot;Inside the voting booth God can see you, Stalin can&#x27;t.&quot; When the Communists were defeated in the 1948 Italian general election, Guareschi did not put his pen down but also criticized the Christian Democracy party.

In 1950, &quot;Candido&quot; published a satirical cartoon by Carlo Manzoni poking fun at Luigi Einaudi, the then president of the Republic. The President is at the Quirinal Palace, surrounded by, instead of the presidential guard of honour (the &quot;corazzieri&quot;), giant bottles of Nebbiolo wine, which Einaudi actually produced on his land in Dogliani. Each bottle was labeled with the institutional logo. The cartoon was judged &quot;in contempt of the President&quot; by a court at the time. Guareschi, as the director of the magazine, was held responsible and sentenced.

In 1954, Guareschi was charged with libel after he published two facsimile wartime letters from resistance leader and former Prime Minister Alcide De Gasperi requesting that the Allies of World War II bomb the outskirts of Rome in order to demoralize Nazi German collaborators. The legitimacy of the letters was never established by the court; after a two-month trial, it found in favour of De Gasperi. Guareschi declined to appeal the verdict and spent 409 days in Parma&#x27;s San Francesco jail, and another six months on probation at his home.

His most famous comic creations are his short stories, begun in the late 1940s, about the rivalry between Don Camillo, a stalwart Italian priest, and the equally hot-headed Peppone, Communist mayor of a Po River Valley village in the &quot;Little World&quot;. These stories were dramatized on radio, television and in films, most notably in the series of films featuring Fernandel as Don Camillo.

By 1956, Guareschi&#x27;s health had deteriorated and he began spending time in Switzerland for treatment. In 1957, he retired as editor of &quot;Candido&quot; but remained a contributor. He died in Cervia in 1968 of a heart attack at the age of 60.

<doc id="169493" wikidata="Q107412" url="?curid=169493" title="Petal">
<text>Petals are modified leaves that form an inner whorl surrounding the reproductive parts of flowers. They are often brightly coloured or unusually shaped to attract pollinators. All of the petals of a flower are collectively known as the corolla. Petals are usually surrounded by an outer whorl of modified leaves called sepals, that collectively form the &quot;calyx&quot; and lie just beneath the corolla. The calyx and the corolla together make up the perianth, the non-reproductive portion of a flower. When the petals and sepals of a flower are difficult to distinguish, they are collectively called tepals. Examples of plants in which the term &quot;tepal&quot; is appropriate include genera such as &quot;Aloe&quot; and &quot;Tulipa&quot;. Conversely, genera such as &quot;Rosa&quot; and &quot;Phaseolus&quot; have well-distinguished sepals and petals. When the undifferentiated tepals resemble petals, they are referred to as &quot;petaloid&quot;, as in petaloid monocots, orders of monocots with brightly coloured tepals. Since they include Liliales, an alternative name is lilioid monocots.

Although petals are usually the most conspicuous parts of animal-pollinated flowers, wind-pollinated species, such as the grasses, either have very small petals or lack them entirely (apetalous).

==Corolla==
The collection of all petals in a flower is referred to as the corolla. The role of the corolla in plant evolution has been studied extensively since Charles Darwin postulated a theory of the origin of elongated corollae and corolla tubes.

A corolla of separate petals, without fusion of individual segments, is &quot;&quot;. If the petals are free from one another in the corolla, the plant is &quot;polypetalous&quot; or &quot;choripetalous&quot;; while if the petals are at least partially fused, it is &quot;gamopetalous&quot; or &quot;sympetalous&quot;. In the case of fused tepals, the term is &quot;syntepalous&quot;. The corolla in some plants forms a tube.

== Variations ==

Petals can differ dramatically in different species. The number of petals in a flower may hold clues to a plant&#x27;s classification. For example, flowers on eudicots (the largest group of dicots) most frequently have four or five petals while flowers on monocots have three or six petals, although there are many exceptions to this rule.

The petal whorl or corolla may be either radially or bilaterally symmetrical. If all of the petals are essentially identical in size and shape, the flower is said to be regular or actinomorphic (meaning &quot;ray-formed&quot;). Many flowers are symmetrical in only one plane (i.e., symmetry is bilateral) and are termed irregular or zygomorphic (meaning &quot;yoke-&quot; or &quot;pair-formed&quot;). In &quot;irregular&quot; flowers, other floral parts may be modified from the &quot;regular&quot; form, but the petals show the greatest deviation from radial symmetry. Examples of zygomorphic flowers may be seen in orchids and members of the pea family.

In many plants of the aster family such as the sunflower, &quot;Helianthus annuus&quot;, the circumference of the flower head is composed of ray florets. Each ray floret is anatomically an individual flower with a single large petal. Florets in the centre of the disc typically have no or very reduced petals. In some plants such as &quot;Narcissus&quot;, the lower part of the petals or tepals are fused to form a floral cup (hypanthium) above the ovary, and from which the petals proper extend.

A petal often consists of two parts: the upper broader part, similar to a leaf blade, also called the &quot;blade;&quot; and the lower narrower part, similar to a leaf petiole, called the &quot;claw&quot;, separated from each other at the &quot;limb&quot;. Claws are distinctly developed in petals of some flowers of the family &quot;Brassicaceae&quot;, such as &quot;Erysimum cheiri&quot;.

The inception and further development of petals show a great variety of patterns. Petals of different species of plants vary greatly in colour or colour pattern, both in visible light and in ultraviolet. Such patterns often function as guides to pollinators and are variously known as nectar guides, pollen guides, and floral guides.

==Genetics==
The genetics behind the formation of petals, in accordance with the ABC model of flower development, are that sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels are modified versions of each other. It appears that the mechanisms to form petals evolved very few times (perhaps only once), rather than evolving repeatedly from stamens.

==Significance of pollination==
Pollination is an important step in the sexual reproduction of higher plants. Pollen is produced by the male flower or by the male organs of hermaphroditic flowers.

Pollen does not move on its own and thus requires wind or animal pollinators to disperse the pollen to the stigma of the same or nearby flowers. However, pollinators are rather selective in determining the flowers they choose to pollinate. This develops competition between flowers and as a result flowers must provide incentives to appeal to pollinators (unless the flower self-pollinates or is involved in wind pollination). Petals play a major role in competing to attract pollinators. Henceforth pollination dispersal could occur and the survival of many species of flowers could prolong.

==Types of pollination==

===Wind pollination===

Wind-pollinated flowers often have small, dull petals and produce little or no scent. Some of these flowers will often have no petals at all. Flowers that depend on wind pollination will produce large amounts of pollen because most of the pollen scattered by the wind tends to not reach other flowers.

===Attracting insects===
Flowers have various regulatory mechanisms to attract insects. One such helpful mechanism is the use of colour guiding marks. Insects such as the bee or butterfly can see the ultraviolet marks which are contained on these flowers, acting as an attractive mechanism which is not visible towards the human eye. Many flowers contain a variety of shapes acting to aid with the landing of the visiting insect and also influence the insect to brush against anthers and stigmas (parts of the flower). One such example of a flower is the pōhutukawa (&quot;Metrosideros excelsa&quot;), which acts to regulate colour in a different way. The pōhutukawa contains small petals also having bright large red clusters of stamens.
Another attractive mechanism for flowers is the use of scents which are highly attractive to humans. One such example is the rose. On the other hand, some flowers produce the smell of rotting meat and are attractive to insects such as flies. Darkness is another factor that flowers have adapted to as nighttime conditions limit vision and colour-perception. Fragrancy can be especially useful for flowers that are pollinated at night by moths and other flying insects.

===Attracting birds===
Flowers are also pollinated by birds and must be large and colourful to be visible against natural scenery. In New Zealand, such bird–pollinated native plants include: kowhai (&quot;Sophora&quot; species), flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) and kaka beak (&quot;Clianthus puniceus&quot;). Flowers adapt the mechanism on their petals to change colour in acting as a communicative mechanism for the bird to visit. An example is the tree fuchsia (&quot;Fuchsia excorticata&quot;), which are green when needing to be pollinated and turn red for the birds to stop coming and pollinating the flower.

===Bat-pollinated flowers===
Flowers can be pollinated by short-tailed bats. An example of this is the dactylanthus (&quot;Dactylanthus taylorii&quot;). This plant has its home under the ground acting the role of a parasite on the roots of forest trees. The dactylanthus has only its flowers pointing to the surface and the flowers lack colour but have the advantage of containing much nectar and a strong scent. These act as a useful mechanism in attracting the bat.

<text>Oliver Wolf Sacks (9 July 1933 – 30 August 2015) was a British neurologist, naturalist, historian of science, and writer. Born in London, Sacks received his medical degree in 1958 from The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, before moving to the United States, where he spent most of his career. He interned at Mount Zion Hospital in San Francisco and completed his residency in neurology and neuropathology at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Later, he served as neurologist at Beth Abraham Hospital&#x27;s chronic-care facility in the Bronx, where he worked with a group of survivors of the 1920s sleeping sickness encephalitis lethargica epidemic, who had been unable to move on their own for decades. His treatment of those patients became the basis of his 1973 book &quot;Awakenings&quot;, which was adapted into an Academy Award-nominated feature film, in 1990, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

His numerous other best-selling books were mostly collections of case studies of people, including himself, with neurological disorders. He also published hundreds of articles (both peer-reviewed scientific articles and articles for a general audience), about neurological disorders, history of science, natural history, and nature. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him a &quot;poet laureate of contemporary medicine&quot;, and &quot;one of the great clinical writers of the 20th century&quot;. Some of his books were adapted for plays by major playwrights, feature films, animated short films, opera, dance, fine art, and musical works in the classical genre. His book &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;, which describes the case histories of some of his patients, became the basis of an opera of the same name.

==Early life and education==
Oliver Wolf Sacks was born in Cricklewood, London, England, the youngest of four children born to Jewish parents: Samuel Sacks, a Lithuanian Jewish doctor (died June 1990), and Muriel Elsie Landau, one of the first female surgeons in England (died 1972), who was one of 18 siblings. Sacks had an extremely large extended family of eminent scientists, physicians and other notable people, including the director and writer Jonathan Lynn and first cousins the Israeli statesman Abba Eban and the Nobel Laureate Robert Aumann.

In December 1939, when Sacks was six years old, he and his older brother Michael were evacuated from London to escape the Blitz, and sent to a boarding school in the English Midlands where he remained until 1943. Unknown to his family, at the school, he and his brother Michael &quot;...subsisted on meager rations of turnips and beetroot and suffered cruel punishments at the hands of a sadistic headmaster.&quot; This is detailed in his first autobiography, &quot;Uncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood&quot;. Beginning with his return home at the age of 10, under his Uncle Dave&#x27;s tutelage, he became an intensely focused amateur chemist. Later, he attended St Paul&#x27;s School in London, where he developed lifelong friendships with Jonathan Miller and Eric Korn.

===Study of medicine===
During adolescence he shared an intense interest in biology with these friends, and later came to share his parents&#x27; enthusiasm for medicine. He chose to study medicine at university and entered The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1951. The first half studying medicine at Oxford is pre-clinical, and he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in physiology and biology in 1956.

Although not required, Sacks chose to stay on for an additional year to undertake research after he had taken a course by Hugh Macdonald Sinclair. Sacks recalls, &quot;I had been seduced by a series of vivid lectures on the history of medicine and nutrition, given by Sinclair... it was the history of physiology, the ideas and personalities of physiologists, which came to life.&quot; Sacks then became involved with the school&#x27;s Laboratory of Human Nutrition under Sinclair. Sacks focused his research on the patent medicine Jamaica ginger, a toxic and commonly abused drug known to cause irreversible nerve damage. After devoting months to research he was disappointed by the lack of help and guidance he received from Sinclair. Sacks wrote up an account of his research findings but stopped working on the subject. As a result he became depressed: &quot;I felt myself sinking into a state of quiet but in some ways agitated despair.&quot;

His tutor at Queen&#x27;s and his parents, seeing his lowered emotional state, suggested he extricate himself from academic studies for a period. His parents then suggested he spend the summer of 1955 living on Israeli kibbutz Ein HaShofet, where the physical labour would help him. Sacks later described his experience on the kibbutz as an &quot;anodyne to the lonely, torturing months in Sinclair&#x27;s lab&quot;. He said he lost from his previously overweight body as a result of the healthy, hard physical labour he performed there. He spent time travelling around the country with time spent scuba diving at the Red Sea port city of Eilat, and began to reconsider his future: &quot;I wondered again, as I had wondered when I first went to Oxford, whether I really wanted to become a doctor. I had become very interested in neurophysiology, but I also loved marine biology;... But I was &#x27;cured&#x27; now; it was time to return to medicine, to start clinical work, seeing patients in London.&quot;

In 1956, Sacks began his study of clinical medicine at the University of Oxford and Middlesex Hospital Medical School. For the next two-and-a-half years, he took courses in medicine, surgery, orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology, psychiatry, dermatology, infectious diseases, obstetrics, and various other disciplines. During his years as a student, he helped home-deliver a number of babies. In 1958, he graduated with Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (BM BCh) degrees, and, as was usual at Oxford, his BA was later promoted to a Master of Arts (MA Oxon) degree.

Having completed his medical degree, Sacks began his pre-registration house officer rotations at Middlesex Hospital the following month. &quot;My eldest brother, Marcus, had trained at the Middlesex,&quot; he said, &quot;and now I was following his footsteps.&quot; Before beginning his house officer post, he said he first wanted some hospital experience to gain more confidence, and took a job at a hospital in St Albans where his mother had worked as an emergency surgeon during the war. He then did his first six-month post in Middlesex Hospital&#x27;s medical unit, followed by another six months in its neurological unit. He completed his pre-registration year in June 1960, but was uncertain about his future.

==Beginning life in North America==

Sacks left Britain and flew to Montreal, Canada, on 9 July 1960, his 27th birthday. He visited the Montreal Neurological Institute and the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF), telling them that he wanted to be a pilot. After some interviews and checking his background, they told him he would be best in medical research. But as he kept making mistakes, including losing data from several months of research, destroying irreplaceable slides, and losing biological samples, his supervisors had second thoughts about him. Dr. Taylor, the head medical officer, told him, &quot;You are clearly talented and we would love to have you, but I am not sure about your motives for joining.&quot; He was told to travel for a few months and reconsider. He used the next three months to travel across Canada and deep into the Canadian Rockies, which he described in his personal journal, later published as &quot;Canada: Pause, 1960&quot;.

In 1961 he arrived in the United States, completing an internship at Mt. Zion Hospital in San Francisco and a residency in neurology and neuropathology at UCLA. While in San Francisco, Sacks became a lifelong close friend of poet Thom Gunn, saying he loved his wild imagination, his strict control, and perfect poetic form. During much of his time at UCLA, he lived in a rented house in Topanga Canyon and experimented with various recreational drugs. He described some of his experiences in a 2012 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article, and in his book &quot;Hallucinations&quot;. During his early career in California and New York City he indulged in:

He wrote that after moving to New York City, an amphetamine-facilitated epiphany that came as he read a book by the 19th-century migraine doctor Edward Liveing inspired him to chronicle his observations on neurological diseases and oddities; to become the &quot;Liveing of our Time&quot;. Though he was a United States resident for the rest of his life, he never became a citizen. He told &quot;The Guardian&quot; in a 2005 interview, &quot;In 1961, I declared my intention to become a United States citizen, which may have been a genuine intention, but I never got round to it. I think it may go with a slight feeling that this was only an extended visit. I rather like the words &#x27;resident alien&#x27;. It&#x27;s how I feel. I&#x27;m a sympathetic, resident, sort of visiting alien.&quot;

==Career==

Sacks served as an instructor and later professor of clinical neurology at Yeshiva University&#x27;s Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 1966 to 2007, and also held an appointment at the New York University School of Medicine from 1992 to 2007. In July 2007 he joined the faculty of Columbia University Medical Center as a professor of neurology and psychiatry. At the same time he was appointed Columbia University&#x27;s first &quot;Columbia University Artist&quot; at the university&#x27;s Morningside Heights campus, recognising the role of his work in bridging the arts and sciences. He was also a visiting professor at the University of Warwick in the UK. He returned to New York University School of Medicine in 2012, serving as a professor of neurology and consulting neurologist in the school&#x27;s epilepsy centre.

Sacks&#x27;s work at Beth Abraham Hospital helped provide the foundation on which the Institute for Music and Neurologic Function (IMNF) is built; Sacks was an honorary medical advisor. The Institute honoured Sacks in 2000 with its first &quot;Music Has Power Award&quot;. The IMNF again bestowed a &quot;Music Has Power Award&quot; on him in 2006 to commemorate &quot;his 40 years at Beth Abraham and honour his outstanding contributions in support of music therapy and the effect of music on the human brain and mind.&quot;

Sacks maintained a busy hospital-based practice in New York City. He accepted a very limited number of private patients, in spite of being in great demand for such consultations. He served on the boards of The Neurosciences Institute and the New York Botanical Garden.

===Writing===
In 1967 Sacks first began to write of his experiences with some of his neurological patients. He burned his first such book, &quot;Ward 23&quot;, during an episode of self-doubt. His books have been translated into over 25 languages. In addition, Sacks was a regular contributor to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;the New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;London Review of Books&quot; and numerous other medical, scientific and general publications. He was awarded the Lewis Thomas Prize for Writing about Science in 2001.

Sacks&#x27;s work is featured in a &quot;broader range of media than those of any other contemporary medical author&quot; and in 1990, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote he &quot;has become a kind of poet laureate of contemporary medicine&quot;.

Sacks considered his literary style to have grown out of the tradition of 19th-century &quot;clinical anecdotes&quot;, a literary style that included detailed narrative case histories, which he termed novelistic. He also counted among his inspirations the case histories of the Russian neuropsychologist A. R. Luria, who became a close friend through correspondence from 1973 until Luria&#x27;s death in 1977. After the publication of his first book &quot;Migraine&quot; in 1970, a review by his close friend W. H. Auden encouraged Sacks to adapt his writing style to &quot;be metaphorical, be mythical, be whatever you need.&quot;

Sacks described his cases with a wealth of narrative detail, concentrating on the experiences of the patient (in the case of his &quot;A Leg to Stand On&quot;, the patient was himself). The patients he described were often able to adapt to their situation in different ways although their neurological conditions were usually considered incurable. His book &quot;Awakenings&quot;, upon which the 1990 feature film of the same name is based, describes his experiences using the new drug levodopa on post-encephalitic patients at the Beth Abraham Hospital, later Beth Abraham Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing, in New York. &quot;Awakenings&quot; was also the subject of the first documentary, made in 1974, for the British television series &quot;Discovery&quot;. Composer and friend of Sacks Tobias Picker composed a ballet inspired by &quot;Awakenings&quot; for the Rambert Dance Company, which was premiered by Rambert in Salford, UK in 2010; In 2022, Picker premiered an opera of Awakenings at Opera Theatre of Saint Louis.

In his memoir &quot;A Leg to Stand On&quot; he wrote about the consequences of a near-fatal accident he had at age 41 in 1974, a year after the publication of &quot;Awakenings&quot;, when he fell off a cliff and severely injured his left leg while mountaineering alone above Hardangerfjord, Norway.

In some of his other books, he describes cases of Tourette syndrome and various effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease. The title article of &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot; describes a man with visual agnosia and was the subject of a 1986 opera by Michael Nyman. The book was edited by Kate Edgar, who formed a long-lasting partnership with Sacks, with Sacks later calling her a “mother figure” and saying that he did his best work when she was with him, including &quot;Seeing Voices, Uncle Tungsten, Musicophilia, and Hallucinations.&quot;

The title article of his book &quot;An Anthropologist on Mars&quot;, which won a Polk Award for magazine reporting, is about Temple Grandin, an autistic professor. He writes in the book&#x27;s preface that neurological conditions such as autism &quot;can play a paradoxical role, by bringing out latent powers, developments, evolutions, forms of life that might never be seen, or even be imaginable, in their absence&quot;. Sacks&#x27;s 1989 book &quot;Seeing Voices&quot; covers a variety of topics in deaf studies. The romantic drama film &quot;At First Sight&quot; (1999) was based on the essay &quot;To See and Not See&quot; in &quot;An Anthropologist on Mars&quot;. Sacks also has a small role in the film as a reporter.

In his book &quot;The Island of the Colorblind&quot; Sacks wrote about an island where many people have achromatopsia (total colourblindness, very low visual acuity and high photophobia). The second section of this book, titled &quot;Cycad Island&quot;, describes the Chamorro people of Guam, who have a high incidence of a neurodegenerative disease locally known as lytico-bodig disease (a devastating combination of ALS, dementia and parkinsonism). Later, along with Paul Alan Cox, Sacks published papers suggesting a possible environmental cause for the disease, namely the toxin beta-methylamino L-alanine (BMAA) from the cycad nut accumulating by biomagnification in the flying fox bat.

In November 2012 Sacks&#x27;s book &quot;Hallucinations&quot; was published. In it he examined why ordinary people can sometimes experience hallucinations and challenged the stigma associated with the word. He explained: &quot;Hallucinations don&#x27;t belong wholly to the insane. Much more commonly, they are linked to sensory deprivation, intoxication, illness or injury.&quot; He also considers the less well known Charles Bonnet syndrome, sometimes found in people who have lost their eyesight. The book was described by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; as: &quot;Elegant... An absorbing plunge into a mystery of the mind.&quot;

Sacks sometimes faced criticism in the medical and disability studies communities. Arthur K. Shapiro, for instance, an expert on Tourette syndrome, said Sacks&#x27;s work was &quot;idiosyncratic&quot; and relied too much on anecdotal evidence in his writings. Researcher Makoto Yamaguchi thought Sacks&#x27;s mathematical explanations, in his study of the numerically gifted savant twins (in &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;), were irrelevant, and questioned Sacks&#x27;s methods. Although Sacks has been characterised as a &quot;compassionate&quot; writer and doctor, others have felt that he exploited his subjects. Sacks was called &quot;the man who mistook his patients for a literary career&quot; by British academic and disability rights activist Tom Shakespeare, and one critic called his work &quot;a high-brow freak show&quot;. Sacks responded, &quot;I would hope that a reading of what I write shows respect and appreciation, not any wish to expose or exhibit for the thrill... but it&#x27;s a delicate business.&quot;

He also wrote &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, &quot;Oaxaca Journal&quot; and &quot;On the Move: A Life&quot; (his second autobiography).

Before his death in 2015 Sacks founded the Oliver Sacks Foundation, a non-profit organization established to increase understanding of the brain through using narrative non-fiction and case histories, with goals that include publishing some of Sacks&#x27;s unpublished writings, and making his vast amount of unpublished writings available for scholarly study. The first posthumous book of Sacks&#x27;s writings, &quot;River of Consciousness&quot;, an anthology of his essays, was published in October 2017. Most of the essays had been previously published in various periodicals or in science-essay-anthology books, but were no longer readily obtainable. Sacks specified the order of his essays in &quot;River of Consciousness&quot; prior to his death. Some of the essays focus on repressed memories and other tricks the mind plays on itself. This was followed by a collection of some of his letters. Sacks was a prolific handwritten-letter correspondent, and never communicated by e-mail.

==Honours==

In 1996, Sacks became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters (Literature). He was named a Fellow of the New York Academy of Sciences in 1999. Also in 1999, he became an Honorary Fellow at the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford.

In 2000, Sacks received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. In 2002, he became Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (Class IV—Humanities and Arts, Section 4—Literature) and he was awarded the 2001 Lewis Thomas Prize by Rockefeller University. Sacks was also a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians (FRCP).

Sacks was awarded honorary doctorates from Georgetown University (1990), College of Staten Island (1991), Tufts University (1991), New York Medical College (1991), Medical College of Pennsylvania (1992), Bard College (1992), Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston (2001), Gallaudet University (2005), Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (2006) and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (2008).

Oxford University awarded him an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree in June 2005.

Sacks received the position &quot;Columbia Artist&quot; from Columbia University in 2007, a post that was created specifically for him and that gave him unconstrained access to the university, regardless of department or discipline.

On 26 November 2008, Sacks was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), for services to medicine, in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

The minor planet 84928 Oliversacks, discovered in 2003, was named in his honour.

In February 2010, Sacks was named as one of the Freedom From Religion Foundation&#x27;s Honorary Board of distinguished achievers. He described himself as &quot;an old Jewish atheist&quot;, a phrase borrowed from his friend Jonathan Miller.

==Personal life==
Sacks never married and lived alone for most of his life. He declined to share personal details until late in his life. He addressed his homosexuality for the first time in his 2015 autobiography &quot;On the Move: A Life&quot;. Celibate for about 35 years since his forties, in 2008 he began a friendship with writer and &quot;New York Times&quot; contributor Bill Hayes. Their friendship slowly evolved into a committed long-term partnership that lasted until Sacks&#x27;s death; Hayes wrote about it in the 2017 memoir &quot;Insomniac City: New York, Oliver, and Me&quot;.

In Lawrence Weschler&#x27;s biography, &quot;And How Are You, Dr. Sacks?&quot;, Sacks is described by a colleague as &quot;deeply eccentric&quot;. A friend from his days as a medical resident mentions Sacks&#x27;s need to violate taboos, like drinking blood mixed with milk, and how he frequently took drugs like LSD and speed in the early 1960s. Sacks himself shared personal information about how he got his first orgasm spontaneously while floating in a swimming pool, and later when he was giving a man a massage. He also admits having &quot;erotic fantasies of all sorts&quot; in a natural history museum he visited often in his youth, many of them about animals, like hippos in the mud.

Sacks noted in a 2001 interview that severe shyness, which he described as &quot;a disease&quot;, had been a lifelong impediment to his personal interactions. He believed his shyness stemmed from his prosopagnosia, popularly known as &quot;face blindness&quot;, a condition that he studied in some of his patients, including the titular man from his work &quot;The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat&quot;. This neurological disability of his, whose severity and whose impact on his life Sacks did not fully grasp until he reached middle age, even sometimes prevented him from recognising his own reflection in mirrors.

Sacks swam almost daily for most of his life, beginning when his swimming-champion father started him swimming as an infant. He especially became publicly well-known for open water swimming when he lived in the City Island section of the Bronx, as he routinely swam around the island, or swam vast distances away from the island and back.

He was also an avid powerlifter.

Sacks was a cousin of the Nobel Memorial Economics laureate Robert Aumann.

===Illness===
Sacks underwent radiation therapy in 2006 for a uveal melanoma in his right eye. He discussed his loss of stereoscopic vision caused by the treatment, which eventually resulted in right-eye blindness, in an article and later in his book &quot;The Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;.

In January 2015, metastases from the ocular tumour were discovered in his liver. Sacks announced this development in a February 2015 &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed piece and estimated his remaining time in &quot;months&quot;. He expressed his intent to &quot;live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can&quot;. He added: &quot;I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Sacks died from cancer on 30 August 2015, at his home in Manhattan at the age of 82, surrounded by his closest friends.

The 2019 documentary &quot;Oliver Sacks: His Own Life&quot; by Ric Burns was based on &quot;the most famous neurologist&quot; Sacks; it noted that during his lifetime neurology resident applicants often said that they had chosen neurology after reading Sacks&#x27;s works. The film includes documents from Sacks&#x27;s archive.

In 2019, A. A. Knopf signed a contract with the historian and biographer Laura J. Snyder to write a biography of Sacks based on exclusive access to his archive.

In 2024, the New York Public Library announced that it had acquired Sacks&#x27;s archive, including 35,000 letters, 7,000 photographs, manuscripts of his books, and journals and notebooks.

<text>Mary Temple Grandin (born August 29, 1947) is an American academic, inventor, and ethologist. She is a prominent proponent of the humane treatment of livestock for slaughter and the author of more than 60 scientific papers on animal behavior. Grandin is a consultant to the livestock industry, where she offers advice on animal behavior, and is also an autism spokesperson.

Grandin is one of the first autistic people to document the insights she gained from her personal experiences with autism. She is a faculty member with Animal Sciences in the College of Agricultural Sciences at Colorado State University.

In 2010, &quot;Time&quot; 100, an annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world, named her in the &quot;Heroes&quot; category. She was the subject of the Emmy- and Golden Globe-winning biographical film &quot;Temple Grandin&quot;. Grandin has been an outspoken proponent of autism rights and neurodiversity movements.

==Early life==
===Family===

Mary Temple Grandin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, into a wealthy family. One of the family&#x27;s employees was also named Mary, so Grandin was referred to by her middle name, Temple, to avoid confusion. Temple&#x27;s mother is Anna Eustacia Purves (later Cutler), an actress, singer, and granddaughter of John Coleman Purves (co-inventor of the aviation autopilot). She has a degree in English from Harvard University. Temple&#x27;s father was Richard McCurdy Grandin, a real estate agent and heir to the largest corporate wheat farm business in the United States at the time, Grandin Farms. Grandin&#x27;s parents divorced when she was 15, and her mother eventually went on to marry Ben Cutler, a New York saxophonist, in 1965, when Grandin was 18 years old. Grandin&#x27;s father died in California in 1993.

Grandin has three younger siblings: two sisters and a brother. Grandin has described one of her sisters as being dyslexic. Her younger sister is an artist, her other sister is a sculptor, and her brother is a banker. John Livingston Grandin (Temple&#x27;s paternal great-grandfather) and his brother William James Grandin were French Huguenots who drilled for oil. John Grandin intended to cut a deal with John D. Rockefeller in a meeting, but the latter kept him waiting so long that he walked out before Rockefeller arrived. The brothers then went into banking, and when Jay Cooke&#x27;s firm collapsed, they received thousands of acres of undeveloped land in North Dakota as debt collateral. They set up wheat farming in the Red River Valley and housed the workers in dormitories. The town of Grandin, North Dakota, is named after John Livingston Grandin.

Although raised in the Episcopal Church, early on Grandin gave up on a belief in a personal deity or intention in favor of a more scientific perspective.

===Diagnosis===
Grandin was not formally diagnosed with autism until her adulthood. When she was two, the only formal diagnosis given to her was &quot;brain damage&quot;, a finding finally dismissed through cerebral imaging at the University of Utah by the time she turned 63 in 2010. While Grandin was still in her mid-teens, her mother chanced upon a diagnostic checklist for autism. After reviewing the checklist, Grandin&#x27;s mother hypothesised that Grandin&#x27;s symptoms were best explained by the disorder. Grandin was later determined to be an autistic savant.

===Early childhood===
When Grandin was a toddler, the medical advice at the time for a diagnosis like hers was to recommend institutionalization, a measure that caused a bitter rift of opinion between Grandin&#x27;s parents. Her father was keen to follow this advice, while her mother was strongly opposed to the idea.

Grandin&#x27;s mother took her to the world&#x27;s leading special needs researchers at the Boston Children&#x27;s Hospital, with the hope of finding an alternative to institutionalization. Grandin&#x27;s mother eventually found a neurologist who suggested a trial of speech therapy. A speech therapist was hired and Grandin received personalized training from the age of two and a half. Her mother later hired a nanny when she was aged three and a half to play turn taking games with Temple and her sister. Grandin started kindergarten in Dedham Country Day School. Her teachers and classmates tried to create an environment to accommodate Grandin&#x27;s needs and sensitivities.

Grandin considers herself fortunate to have had supportive mentors from elementary school onward. Even so, Grandin states that junior high and high school were the most unpleasant times of her life.

===Middle school and high school===
Grandin attended Beaver Country Day School from seventh to ninth grade. She was expelled at the age of 14 for throwing a book at a schoolmate who taunted her. Grandin described herself as the &quot;nerdy kid&quot; whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when she walked down the hallway and her fellow students kept calling her a &quot;tape recorder&quot; because she would perseverate. Grandin stated in 2012, &quot;I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt.&quot;

The year after her expulsion, Grandin&#x27;s parents divorced. Three years later, Grandin&#x27;s mother married Ben Cutler, a New York saxophonist. At 15 Grandin spent a summer on the Arizona ranch of Ben Cutler&#x27;s sister, Ann, and this would become a formative experience toward her subsequent career interest.

Several reports and sources cited the different names of the schools Grandin attended: Beaver Country Day School or Cherry Falls Girls&#x27; School (the latter named in her first book, &quot;Emergence: Labeled Autistic&quot;); and Hampshire Country School or Mountain Day School (the latter called by Grandin in the early books). Following her expulsion from Beaver Country Day School, Grandin&#x27;s mother enrolled her at Hampshire Country School in Rindge, New Hampshire. That school was founded in 1948 by Boston child psychologist, Henry Patey, for the students of &quot;exceptional potential (gifted) that have not been successful in a typical setting&quot;. She was accepted there and became Winter Carnival Queen and captain of the hockey team. At HCS, Grandin met William Carlock, a science teacher who had worked for NASA, who became her mentor and helped her significantly toward building up her self-confidence.

It was Carlock who encouraged Grandin to develop her idea to build her squeeze machine (hug box) when she returned from her aunt&#x27;s farm in Arizona in her senior year of high school. At the age of 18 when she was still attending Hampshire Country School, with Carlock&#x27;s and school owner/founder Henry Patey&#x27;s support, Grandin built the hug box. Carlock&#x27;s supportive role in Grandin&#x27;s life continued even after she left Hampshire Country School. As a favor to Henry Patey, the President of the newly founded Franklin Pierce College (5 miles from Hampshire Country School) agreed to accept Temple as a student without the typical records and files of a typical High School student. When Grandin was facing criticism for her hug box at Franklin Pierce College, it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device. It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus the rigid obsessions she experienced with the hug box into a productive assignment that subsequently allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be widely cited as evidence of Grandin&#x27;s resourcefulness.

===Higher education===
After she graduated from Hampshire Country School in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her bachelor&#x27;s degree in human psychology from Franklin Pierce College in 1970, a master&#x27;s degree in animal science from Arizona State University in 1975, and a doctoral degree in animal science from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1989.

==Career==
===Autism spectrum===
Steve Silberman, in his book &quot;NeuroTribes&quot;, wrote that Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. Bernard Rimland, a father of an autistic son and author of the book &quot;Infantile Autism&quot;, wrote the foreword to Grandin&#x27;s first book &quot;Emergence: Labeled Autistic&quot;. Her book was published in 1986. Rimland wrote &quot;Temple&#x27;s ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.&quot;

In &quot;Developing Talents, 2nd Edition&quot;, Grandin explores many unnoticed aspects of vocational rehabilitation programs that provide job training and placement for people with disabilities, as well as Social Security Administration programs that offer vocational assistance.

In her later book, &quot;Thinking in Pictures&quot;, published in 1995, the neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided &quot;a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.&quot;

In her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, Bernard Rimland used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings, she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, &quot;It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.&quot;

Grandin has said that when her book &quot;Thinking in Pictures&quot; was published in 1995, she thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were: 1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers – who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers – who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history.

In one of her later books, &quot;The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum&quot;, the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was Clara Claiborne Park&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter&#x27;s Life with Autism&quot;. It was published in 2001. &quot;The Autistic Brain&quot; also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities.

Grandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by Oliver Sacks in the title narrative of his book &quot;An Anthropologist on Mars&quot; (1995), for which he won a Polk Award. The title is derived from Grandin&#x27;s characterization of how she feels around neurotypical people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of Ruth C. Sullivan, one of the founders of the Autism Society of America (ASA). Sullivan writes:
Based on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her hypersensitivity to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks &quot;totally in pictures&quot;, using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated. Grandin attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.

As a proponent of neurodiversity, Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes entirely or treating mildly-autistic individuals. However, she believes that autistic children who are severely disabled and nonverbal need therapies &quot;like [applied behavioral analysis] [...] to function&quot;, and stated in her book, &quot;Thinking in Pictures,&quot; &quot;In an ideal world the scientist should find a method to prevent the most severe forms of autism but allow the milder forms to survive.&quot;

In March of every year, Grandin hosts a public event at Boston University. The event was cancelled in March 2020 due to COVID-19.

===Handling livestock===
In 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: &quot;Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design&quot; in the &quot;International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33–52&quot; and &quot;Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities&quot;, &quot;Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19–31.&quot; She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her dissertation was &quot;Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs&quot;. Grandin expanded her theories in her book, &quot;Animals Make Us Human&quot;.

In 1993, she edited the first edition of &quot;Livestock Handling and Transport&quot;. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, 2014, 2019, and 2024. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student Bridgett Voisinet conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, &quot;Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments&quot;, published in &quot;The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892–896.&quot;

Another important paper published by Grandin was, &quot;Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport&quot;, &quot;Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249–257&quot;. This paper presented the concept that an animal&#x27;s previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry.

A major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This system is used by many large meat companies. It is described in &quot;Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling&quot;, first published in the &quot;Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327–338&quot; in 1988, and &quot;Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant&quot;, &quot;Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215–228&quot;, published in 2003.

Grandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at slaughtering plants. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in &quot;Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants&quot;, &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 212, pp. 3–39, &quot;The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter&quot;, &quot;Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp. 121–128,&quot; and &quot;Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices&quot;, &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp. 848–851.

In 2008, Grandin published &quot;Humane Livestock Handling&quot; with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin&#x27;s ideas relating to humane livestock handling. Many of her contributions to the field of handling livestock and the design of livestock handling systems advocated for in her books are available through her website as well. Grandin helped design animal processing plants at the White Oak Pastures organic farm in Bluffton, Georgia.

===Other scientific contributions===
Grandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.

===Animal welfare===

Grandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin&#x27;s claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals&#x27; reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal&#x27;s head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them.

Her business website promotes the improvement of standards for slaughterhouses and livestock farms.

In 2004, Grandin won a &quot;Proggy&quot; award in the &quot;Visionary&quot; category, from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.

One of her notable essays about animal welfare is &quot;Animals Are Not Things&quot;, in which she posits that technically, animals are property in society, but the law ultimately gives them ethical protections or rights. She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such &quot;properties&quot;, because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot torture an animal.

Her insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers in 2009.

In 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of pink slime, Grandin spoke out in support of the food product. She said, &quot;It should be on the market. It should be labeled. We should not be throwing away that much beef.&quot;

Grandin&#x27;s work has attracted the attention of philosophers interested in the moral status of animals. Andy Lamey has argued that while Grandin&#x27;s method of slaughter is a significant positive development for animals, her attempts to formulate a moral defense of meat-eating have been less successful.
&#x27;

==Personal life==
Grandin says that &quot;the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me&quot;, and she has neither married nor had children. She later stated that she preferred the science fiction, documentary, and thriller genre of films and television shows to more dramatic or romantic ones. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include horseback riding, science fiction, movies, and biochemistry.

She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. Grandin has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her sensory processing disorder and has structured her lifestyle to avoid sensory overload. She regularly takes antidepressants, but no longer uses her squeeze machine, stating in February 2010 that: &quot;It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I&#x27;m into hugging people now.&quot;

When she was in boarding school, Grandin chose to live a celibate life and, in an interview with &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in 2013, stated, &quot;Now I&#x27;m old enough to where sexual urges are all gone, and it&#x27;s like, good riddance.&quot;

==Honors==
In 2010, Grandin was named in the &quot;Time 100&quot; list of the one hundred most influential people in the world, in the &quot;Heroes&quot; category. In 2011, she received a Double Helix Medal. She has received honorary degrees from many universities including McGill University in Canada (1999), and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences (2009), Carnegie Mellon University in the United States (2012), and Emory University (2016). In 2015, she was named an honorary fellow of the Society for Technical Communication.

In 2011, Grandin was awarded the Ashoka Fellowship. In 2012, Grandin was inducted into the Colorado Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame, the Texas Trail of Fame. and the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum. Grandin received a Meritorious Achievement Award from the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) in 2015.

In 2016, Grandin was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 2017, Grandin was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2023, Grandin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Iowa State University and was later awarded an honorary Doctor of Veterinary Medicine from Kansas State University. This recognition is her first DVM.

==Media==
Grandin has been featured on major media programs, such as Lisa Davis&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s Your Health&quot;, ABC&#x27;s &quot;Primetime Live&quot;, the &quot;Today Show&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, and &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot;. She has been written up in &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;People&quot; magazine, &quot;Discover&quot; magazine, &quot;Forbes&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She was the subject of the &quot;Horizon&quot; documentary &quot;The Woman Who Thinks Like a Cow&quot;, first broadcast by the BBC on (2006), and &quot;Nick News with Linda Ellerbee&quot; (2006). She also was the subject of the first episode in the series &quot;First Person&quot; by Errol Morris.

Grandin is the focus of a semi-biographical HBO film entitled &quot;Temple Grandin&quot;, starring Claire Danes as Grandin (2010). It was nominated for 15 Primetime Emmy Awards and won seven, including Outstanding Television Movie and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or Movie for Claire Danes. At the 68th Golden Globe Awards (2011), Claire Danes won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film.

Grandin was featured in &quot;Beautiful Minds: A Voyage Into the Brain&quot;, a documentary produced in 2006 by Colourfield Tell-A-Vision, a German company. She was named one of 2010&#x27;s one hundred most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. In 2011, she was featured in an episode of the Science documentary series &quot;Ingenious Minds&quot;. In 2018, Grandin was featured in the documentary &quot;This Business of Autism&quot;, which explored autism employment and the success story of autism employers such as Spectrum Designs Foundation and was produced by Mesh Omnimedia.

She was featured in Michael Pollan&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, in which she discussed the livestock industry.

Folk-punk band AJJ, formerly known as Andrew Jackson Jihad, included two songs called &quot;Temple Grandin&quot; and &quot;Temple Grandin Too&quot; on their LP &quot;Christmas Island&quot;. In 2017, Grandin was the focus of a children&#x27;s book by author Julia Finlay Mosca titled &quot;The Girl Who Thought In Pictures, A Story of Temple Grandin&quot;.

In 2018, Grandin was profiled in the book &quot;Rescuing Ladybugs&quot; by author and animal advocate Jennifer Skiff as a &quot;global hero&quot; for &quot;standing her ground and fighting for change after witnessing the extreme mistreatment of animals&quot; used in farming. In 2023, &quot;I am Temple Grandin&quot; was added to the children&#x27;s book series known as &quot;Ordinary People Change the World&quot; by author Brad Meltzer and illustrator Chris Eliopoulos. The show &quot;Xavier Riddle and the Secret Museum&quot; on PBS, based on this book series, featured Grandin in Season 2, Episode 9 &quot;James Naismith / Temple Grandin.&quot; In 2024, Grandin was profiled in a biographical chapter bearing her name in the book &quot;Don&#x27;t Mourn for Us: The Autistic Life of Jim Sinclair and an Extraordinary Story of Neurodiversity,&quot; and was described as &quot;the superstar of the autism community.&quot;

<doc id="169498" wikidata="Q5075435" url="?curid=169498" title="Alopecia areata">
<text>Alopecia areata (AA), also known as spot baldness, is a condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. It often results in a few bald spots on the scalp, each about the size of a coin. Psychological stress and illness are possible factors in bringing on alopecia areata in individuals at risk, but in most cases there is no obvious trigger. People are generally otherwise healthy. In a few cases, all the hair on the scalp is lost (&quot;alopecia totalis&quot;), or all body hair is lost (&quot;alopecia universalis&quot;). Hair loss can be permanent, or temporary.
Alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune disease resulting from a breach in the immune privilege of the hair follicles. Risk factors include a family history of the condition. Among identical twins, if one is affected, the other has about a 50% chance of also being affected. The underlying mechanism involves failure by the body to recognize its own cells, with subsequent immune-mediated destruction of the hair follicle.
No cure for the condition is known. Some treatments, particularly triamcinolone injections and 5% minoxidil topical creams, are effective in speeding hair regrowth. Sunscreen, head coverings to protect from cold and sun, and glasses, if the eyelashes are missing, are also recommended. In more than 50% of cases of sudden-onset localized &quot;patchy&quot; disease, hair regrows within a year. In patients with only one or two patches, this one-year recovery will occur in up to 80%. However, many people will have more than one episode over the course of a lifetime. In many patients, hair loss and regrowth occurs simultaneously over the course of several years. Among those in whom all body hair is lost, fewer than 10% recover.
About 0.15% of people are affected at any one time, and 2% of people are affected at some point in time. Onset is usually in childhood. Females are affected at higher rates than males.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Typical first symptoms of alopecia areata are small bald patches. The underlying skin is unscarred and looks superficially normal. Although these patches can take many shapes, they are usually round or oval. Alopecia areata most often affects the scalp and beard, but may occur on any part of the body with hair. Different areas of the skin may exhibit hair loss and regrowth at the same time. The disease may also go into remission for a time, or may be permanent. It is common in children.

The area of hair loss may tingle or be mildly painful. The hair tends to fall out over a short period of time, with the loss commonly occurring more on one side of the scalp than the other.

Exclamation point hairs, narrower along the length of the strand closer to the base, producing a characteristic &quot;exclamation point&quot; appearance, are often present. These hairs are very short (3–4 mm), and can be seen surrounding the bald patches.

When healthy hair is pulled out, at most a few should come out, and ripped hair should not be distributed evenly across the tugged portion of the scalp. In cases of alopecia areata, hair tends to pull out more easily along the edge of the patch where the follicles are already being attacked by the body&#x27;s immune system than away from the patch where they are still healthy.

Nails may have pitting or trachyonychia. Onychoptosis defluvium, also known as alopecia unguium, is casting off the nail seen in association with alopecia areata.

== Causes ==
Alopecia areata is thought to be a systemic autoimmune disorder in which the body attacks its own anagen hair follicles and suppresses or stops hair growth. For example, T cell lymphocytes cluster around affected follicles, causing inflammation and subsequent hair loss. Hair follicles in a normal state are thought to be kept secure from the immune system, a phenomenon called immune privilege. A breach in this immune privilege state is considered as the cause of alopecia areata. A few cases of babies being born with congenital alopecia areata have been reported. It is recognized as a type 1 inflammatory disease.

Alopecia areata is not contagious. It occurs more frequently in people who have affected family members, suggesting heredity may be a factor. Strong evidence of genetic association with increased risk for alopecia areata was found by studying families with two or more affected members. This study identified at least four regions in the genome that are likely to contain these genes. In addition, alopecia areata shares genetic risk factors with other autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes, and celiac disease. It may be the only manifestation of celiac disease.

Lifestyle factors such as smoking, sleep quality, and obesity may also contribute to the onset and progression of alopecia areata. Studies indicate that smokers have a higher risk of developing the condition, potentially due to tobacco-induced Th17-mediated inflammation in hair follicles. While some research suggests a link between sleep disorders and alopecia areata, findings remain inconclusive. However, since sleep disturbances impact immune function, they may play a role in disease pathogenesis. Additionally, obesity is associated with an increased risk of alopecia areata, likely due to adipokine dysregulation, which promotes chronic low-grade inflammation and alters immune response, as seen in other inflammatory skin conditions.

Endogenous retinoids metabolic defect is a key part of the pathogenesis of the alopecia areata.

In 2010, a genome-wide association study was completed that identified 129 single nucleotide polymorphisms that were associated with alopecia areata. The genes that were identified include those involved in
controlling the activation and proliferation of regulatory T cells, cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4, interleukin-2, interleukin-2 receptor A, and Eos (also known as Ikaros family zinc finger 4), as well as the human leukocyte antigen. The study also identified two genes, &quot;PRDX5&quot; and &quot;STX17&quot;, that are expressed in the hair follicle.

There is emerging evidence suggesting a possible link between AA and vaccinations, including influenza, zoster, and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines. One possible explanation is that vaccinations could trigger immune system activation, which has been observed to exacerbate preexisting autoimmune or autoinflammatory conditions in at-risk populations. A small study observed hair loss exacerbation in three patients following COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations (Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna). These patients, who were younger on average (30.6 years) compared to unaffected individuals (37.2 years), experienced worsening hair loss within two weeks post-vaccination. Similar cases have been reported with the AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. However, AA flares have also been linked to SARS-CoV-2 infection, either as an exacerbation of preexisting disease or a new diagnosis. In the study&#x27;s non-vaccinated AA cohort, the only observed case of hair loss worsening occurred after a COVID-19 infection. While causality remains unclear, these findings emphasize the need for further research into the relationship between vaccinations and AA progression.

A psychodermatological connection is noted with impairment in psychiatric comorbidities including mental well-being, self esteem and mental disorders acting as pathogenic triggers for alopecia areata.

== Diagnosis ==

Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical features.

Trichoscopy may aid in establishing the diagnosis. In alopecia areata, trichoscopy shows regularly distributed &quot;yellow dots&quot; (hyperkeratotic plugs), small exclamation-mark hairs, and &quot;black dots&quot; (destroyed hairs in the hair follicle opening).

Oftentimes, however, discrete areas of hair loss surrounded by exclamation mark hairs is sufficient for clinical diagnosis of alopecia areata. Sometimes, reddening of the skin, erythema, may also be present in the balding area.

A biopsy is rarely needed to make the diagnosis or aid in the management of alopecia areata. Histologic findings may include peribulbar lymphocytic infiltration resembling a &quot;swarm of bees&quot;, a shift in the anagen-to-telogen ratio towards telogen, and dilated follicular infundibulae. Other helpful findings can include pigment incontinence in the hair bulb and follicular stelae. Occasionally, in inactive alopecia areata, no inflammatory infiltrates are found.

=== Classification ===
Commonly, alopecia areata involves hair loss in one or more round spots on the scalp.
* Hair may also be lost more diffusely over the whole scalp, in which case the condition is called diffuse alopecia areata.
* Alopecia areata monolocularis describes baldness in only one spot. It may occur anywhere on the head.
* Alopecia areata multilocularis refers to multiple areas of hair loss.
* Ophiasis refers to hair loss in the shape of a wave at the circumference of the head.
* The disease may be limited only to the beard, in which case it is called alopecia areata barbae.
* If the person loses all the hair on the scalp, the disease is then called alopecia areata totalis.
* If all body hair, including pubic hair, is lost, the diagnosis then becomes alopecia areata universalis.
Alopecia areata totalis and universalis are rare.

== Treatment ==
The objective assessment of treatment efficacy is very difficult and spontaneous remission is unpredictable, but if the affected area is patchy, the hair may regrow spontaneously in many cases. None of the existing therapeutic options are curative or preventive. A 2020 systematic review showed greater than 50% hair regrowth in 80.9% of patients treated with 5 mg/mL triamcinolone injections. A Cochrane-style systematic review published in 2019 showed 5% topical minoxidil was more than 8x more associated with &gt;50% hair regrowth at 6 months compared to placebo. In cases of severe hair loss, limited success has been achieved by using the corticosteroid medications clobetasol or fluocinonide as an injection or cream. Application of corticosteroid creams to the affected skin is less effective and takes longer to produce results. Steroid injections are commonly used in sites where the areas of hair loss on the head are small or especially where eyebrow hair has been lost. Whether they are effective is uncertain. Some other medications that have been used are minoxidil, Elocon (mometasone) ointment (steroid cream), irritants (anthralin or topical coal tar), and topical immunotherapy ciclosporin, sometimes in different combinations. Topical corticosteroids frequently fail to enter the skin deeply enough to affect the hair bulbs, which are the treatment target, and small lesions typically also regrow spontaneously. Oral corticosteroids may decrease the hair loss, but only for the period during which they are taken, and these medications can cause serious side effects. No one treatment is effective in all cases, and some individuals may show no response to any treatment.

For more severe cases, studies have shown promising results with the individual use of the immunosuppressant methotrexate or adjunct use with corticosteroids.

When alopecia areata is associated with celiac disease, treatment with a gluten-free diet allows for complete and permanent regrowth of scalp and other body hair in many people, but in others, remissions and recurrences are seen. This improvement is probably due to the normalization of the immune response as a result of gluten withdrawal from the diet.

In June 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized baricitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, for the treatment of severe alopecia areata.

Ritlecitinib (Litfulo) was approved for medical use in the United States in June 2023.

Fecal matter transplants (FMT) have been shown to reverse AA and support hair growth, with long lasting results, even going as far as growing additional hair on arms and face while grey hairs even regained colour. This supports the idea of a connection between gut microbiota having a part in hair loss.

Hair transplantation may be an alternative for patients with chronic local alopecia areata. The fact that the disease is autoimmune and progresses with relapses is one of the biggest question marks before surgery. There have been case reports in the literature since the early 2000s. However, in an article published long-term follow-up; It is reported that the hair transplanted to the eyebrow area falls out again due to the recurrence of the disease. A similar situation was not mentioned in previous studies on this subject. Perhaps the long-term follow-ups of other studies were not sufficient.

Deuruxolitinib (Leqselvi) was approved for medical use in the United States in July 2024.

== Prognosis ==

In most cases that begin with a small number of patches of hair loss, hair grows back after a few months to a year. In cases with a greater number of patches, hair can either grow back or progress to alopecia areata totalis or, in rare cases, alopecia areata universalis.

No loss of body function occurs, and the effects of alopecia areata are psychological (loss of self-image due to hair loss), although these can be severe. Loss of hair also means the scalp burns more easily in the sun. Patients may also have aberrant nail formation because keratin forms both hair and nails.

Hair may grow back and then fall out again later. This may not indicate a recurrence of the condition, but rather a natural cycle of growth-and-shedding from a relatively synchronised start; such a pattern will fade over time. Episodes of alopecia areata before puberty predispose to chronic recurrence of the condition.

Alopecia can be the cause of psychological stress. Because hair loss can lead to significant changes in appearance, individuals with it may experience social phobia, anxiety, and depression.

== Epidemiology ==

The condition affects 0.1%–0.2% of the population, with a lifetime risk of 1%-2%, and is more common in females.

Alopecia areata occurs in people who are otherwise healthy and have no other skin disorders. Initial presentation most commonly occurs in the early childhood, late teenage years, or young adulthood, but can happen at any ages. Patients also tend to have a slightly higher incidence of conditions related to the immune system, such as asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis, and hypothyroidism.

=== Ethnic and socioeconomic disparities ===
The prevalence and impact of AA vary across different ethnic groups and socioeconomic backgrounds. Studies indicate that people of Asian descent have the highest risk, with nearly 6 cases per 100 people, compared to fewer than 2 cases per 100 people among White individuals. People living in urban or economically disadvantaged areas face a higher likelihood of developing AA. The effects of the condition also differ by ethnicity: individuals of Black descent with AA are more likely to experience anxiety and require medical leave from work. These findings suggest that genetic, environmental, and social factors may influence both the likelihood of developing AA and its broader personal and professional impact.

== Society and culture ==
The term &quot;alopecia&quot;, used by physicians dating back to Hippocrates, originates from the Greek word for fox, &quot;alopex&quot;, and was so-named due to fur loss seen in fox mange. &quot;Areata&quot; is derived from the Latin word, &quot;area&quot;, meaning a vacant space or patch.

Alopecia areata and alopecia barbae have been identified by some as the biblical condition that is part of the greater family of skin disorders; the said disorders are purported to being discussed in the Book of Leviticus, chapter 13.

===Notable people===
NASCAR driver Joey Logano, obstacle athlete Kevin Bull, politicians Peter Dutton and Ayanna Pressley, K-pop singer Peniel Shin of BtoB, actors Christopher Reeve, Anthony Carrigan and Alan Fletcher, and actresses Jada Pinkett Smith, May Calamawy, and Lili Reinhart all have some form of alopecia areata.

== Research ==

Many medications are being studied.

In 2014, preliminary findings showing that oral ruxolitinib, a drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for bone marrow disorder myelofibrosis, restored hair growth in three individuals with long-standing and severe disease.

In March 2020, the US FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to baricitinib for the systematic treatment of alopecia areata and granted approval in June 2022, with a 32% efficacy rate for people with 50% hair loss reaching 80% scalp coverage in 36 weeks. It acts as an inhibitor of janus kinase (JAK), blocking the subtypes JAK1 and JAK2.
