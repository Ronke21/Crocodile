<text>A glove is a garment covering the hand, with separate sheaths or openings for each finger including the thumb. Gloves protect and comfort hands against cold or heat, damage by friction, abrasion or chemicals, and disease; or in turn to provide a guard for what a bare hand should not touch.

Gloves are made of materials including cloth, knitted or felted wool, leather, rubber, latex, neoprene, silk, and (in mail) metal. Gloves of kevlar protect the wearer from cuts. Gloves and gauntlets are integral components of pressure suits and spacesuits.

Latex, nitrile rubber or vinyl disposable gloves are often worn by health care professionals as hygiene and contamination protection measures. Police officers often wear them to work in crime scenes to prevent destroying evidence in the scene. Many criminals wear gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, which makes the crime investigation more difficult. However, the gloves themselves can leave prints that are just as unique as human fingerprints.

If there is an opening but no (or a short) covering sheath for each finger they are called fingerless gloves. Fingerless gloves are useful where dexterity is required that gloves would restrict. Cigarette smokers and church organists sometimes use fingerless gloves. Cycling gloves for road racing or touring are usually fingerless. Guitar players may also use fingerless gloves in circumstances where it is too cold to play with an uncovered hand.

A hybrid of glove and mitten contains open-ended sheaths for the four fingers (as in a fingerless glove, but not the thumb) and an additional compartment encapsulating the four fingers. This compartment can be lifted off the fingers and folded back to allow the individual fingers ease of movement and access while the hand remains covered. The usual design is for the mitten cavity to be stitched onto the back of the fingerless glove only, allowing it to be flipped over (normally held back by Velcro or a button) to transform the garment from a mitten to a glove. These hybrids are called convertible mittens or &quot;glittens&quot;.

==History==

Gloves appear to be of great antiquity. They are depicted in an ancient Egyptian tomb dating to the 5th dynasty. According to some translations of Homer&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;, Laërtes is described as wearing gloves while walking in his garden so as to avoid the brambles. (Other translations, however, insist that Laertes pulled his long sleeves over his hands.) Herodotus, in &quot;The History of Herodotus&quot; (440 BC), tells how Leotychides was incriminated by a glove (gauntlet) full of silver that he received as a bribe. There are occasional references to the use of gloves among the Romans as well. Pliny the Younger (c. 100), his uncle&#x27;s shorthand writer wore gloves in winter so as not to impede the elder Pliny&#x27;s work.

A gauntlet, which could be a glove made of leather or some kind of metal armour, was a strategic part of a soldier&#x27;s defense throughout the Middle Ages, but the advent of firearms made hand-to-hand combat rare. As a result, the need for gauntlets disappeared.

During the 13th century, gloves began to be worn by ladies as a fashion ornament. They were made of linen and silk, and sometimes reached to the elbow. Such worldly accoutrements were not for holy women, according to the early 13th century &quot;Ancrene Wisse&quot;, written for their guidance. Sumptuary laws were promulgated to restrain this vanity: against samite gloves in Bologna, 1294, against perfumed gloves in Rome, 1560.

A Paris &quot;corporation&quot; or guild of glovers (&quot;gantiers&quot;) existed from the thirteenth century. They made them in skin or in fur.

By 1440, in England glovers had become members of the Dubbers or Bookbinders Guild until they formed their own guild during the reign of Elizabeth I. The Glovers&#x27; Company was incorporated in 1613.

It was not until the 16th century that gloves reached their greatest elaboration, however, when Queen Elizabeth I set the fashion for wearing them richly embroidered and jewelled, and for putting them on and taking them off during audiences to draw attention to her beautiful hands. The 1592 &quot;Ditchley&quot; portrait of her features her holding leather gloves in her left hand. In Paris, the &quot;gantiers&quot; became &quot;gantiers parfumeurs&quot;, for the scented oils, musk, ambergris and civet, that perfumed leather gloves, but their trade, which was an introduction at the court of Catherine de Medici, was not specifically recognised until 1656, in a royal &quot;brevet&quot;. Makers of knitted gloves, which did not retain perfume and had less social cachet, were organised in a separate guild, of &quot;bonnetiers&quot; who might knit silk as well as wool. Such workers were already organised in the fourteenth century. Knitted gloves were a refined handiwork that required five years of apprenticeship; defective work was subject to confiscation and burning. In the 17th century, gloves made of soft chicken skin became fashionable. The craze for gloves called &quot;limericks&quot; took hold. This particular fad was the product of a manufacturer in Limerick, Ireland, who fashioned the gloves from the skin of unborn calves.
Embroidered and jeweled gloves formed part of the insignia of emperors and kings. Thus Matthew of Paris, in recording the burial of Henry II of England in 1189, mentions that he was buried in his coronation robes with a golden crown on his head and gloves on his hands. Gloves were found on the hands of King John when his tomb was opened in 1797 and on those of King Edward I when his tomb was opened in 1774.

Pontifical gloves are liturgical ornaments used primarily by the pope, the cardinals, and bishops. They may be worn only at the celebration of mass. The liturgical use of gloves has not been traced beyond the beginning of the 10th century, and their introduction may have been due to a simple desire to keep the hands clean for the holy mysteries, but others suggest that they were adopted as part of the increasing pomp with which the Carolingian bishops were surrounding themselves. From the Frankish kingdom the custom spread to Rome, where liturgical gloves are first heard of in the earlier half of the 11th century.
When short sleeves came into fashion in the 1700s, women began to wear long gloves, reaching halfway up the forearm. By the 1870s, buttoned kid, silk, or velvet gloves were worn with evening or dinner dress, and long suede gloves were worn during the day and when having tea.

Mainly during the 19th century, the generic or trade name &quot;Berlin gloves&quot; was used for washable, thin white cotton gloves often worn by servants, such as butlers or waiters, and the less well-off in civilian life. The term was also used for white cotton gloves worn with the dress uniform by the American military in the First World War.

In 1905, &quot;The Law Times&quot; made one of the first references to the use of gloves by criminals to hide fingerprints, stating: &quot;For the future... when the burglar goes a-burgling, a pair of gloves will form a necessary part of his outfit.&quot;

Early Formula One race cars used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of driving gloves.

Disposable latex gloves were developed by the Australian company Ansell.

===Women&#x27;s fashion===

Western women&#x27;s gloves for formal and semi-formal wear come in three lengths: wrist (&quot;matinee&quot;), elbow, and opera or full-length (over the elbow, reaching to the biceps). Satin and stretch satin are popular and mass-produced. Some women wear gloves as part of &quot;dressy&quot; outfits, such as for church and weddings. Long white gloves are common accessories for teenage girls attending formal events such as prom, , cotillion, or formal ceremonies at church, such as confirmation.

===Others===
In Japan, white gloves are worn frequently. Work-oriented white gloves are worn for activities such as gardening and cleanup; &quot;dress&quot; white gloves are worn by professionals who want a clean public appearance, such as taxi drivers, police, politicians and elevator operators. However white gloves are not recommended for touching old books and similar antiquities.

==Fingerless gloves==

Fingerless gloves or &quot;glovelettes&quot; are garments worn on the hands which resemble regular gloves in most ways, except that the finger columns are half-length and opened, allowing the top-half of the wearer&#x27;s fingers to be shown.

Fingerless gloves are often padded in the palm area, to provide protection to the hand, and the exposed fingers do not interfere with sensation or gripping. In contrast to traditional full gloves, often worn for warmth, fingerless gloves will often have a ventilated back to allow the hands to cool; this is commonly seen in weightlifting gloves.

Fingerless gloves are worn by bicyclists and motorcyclists to better grip the handlebars, as well as by skateboarders and rollerbladers, to protect the palms of the hands and add grip in the event of a fall. Some anglers, particularly fly fishermen, favour fingerless gloves to allow manipulation of line and tackle in cooler conditions. Fingerless gloves are common among marching band members, particularly those who play the clarinet or open-hole flute, due to the difficulty of covering small holes while wearing gloves. The lack of fabric on the fingertips allows for better use of touchscreens, as on smartphones and tablet computers. Professional MMA fighters are required to wear fingerless gloves in fights.

==Leather gloves==

===Common uses===
Leather gloves have been worn by people for thousands of years. The unique properties of leather allow for both a comfortable fit and useful grip for the wearer. The grain present on the leather and the pores present in the leather gives the gloves the unique ability to assist the wearer as they grip an object. As soft as a leather glove may be, its pores and grain provide a level of friction when &quot;gripped&quot; against an item or surface.

A common use for leather gloves is sporting events. In baseball, a baseball glove is an oversized leather glove with a web used for fielding the ball. Leather gloves are also used in handball, cycling, and American football.

Early Formula One racing drivers used steering wheels taken directly from road cars. They were normally made from wood, necessitating the use of driving gloves.

Leather gloves provide protection from occupational hazards. For example, beekeepers use leather gloves to avoid being stung by bees. Construction workers might use leather gloves for added grip and for protecting their hands. Welders use gloves too for protection against electrical shocks, extreme heat, ultraviolet and infrared.

Criminals have been known to wear leather gloves during the commission of crimes. Gloves are worn by criminals because the tactile properties of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties are the result of a grain present on the surface of the leather. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Investigators are able to dust for the glove prints left behind from the leather the same way in which they dust for fingerprints.

===Leather dress gloves===

====Main types of gloving leather====
Leather is a natural product with special characteristics that make it comfortable to wear, and give it great strength and flexibility. Because it is a natural product, with its own unique variations, every piece has its own individual characteristics. As they are worn and used, leather gloves (especially if they fit snugly) will conform to the wearer&#x27;s hand. As this occurs the leather of the glove will become more malleable, and thus softer and more supple. This process is known as &#x27;breaking-in&#x27; the glove. Overtime wear spots may appear on certain parts of the palm and fingertips, due to the constant use of those areas of the glove. Creases and wrinkles will appear on the palm side of the leather glove and will generally correspond to the locations of the hinge joints of the wearer&#x27;s hands, including the interphalangeal articulations of hand, metacarpophalangeal joints, intercarpal articulations, and wrists.

Because the leather is natural as well as delicate, the wearer must take precaution as to not damage them. The constant handling of damp or wet surfaces will discolor lighter-colored gloves and stiffen the leather of any glove. The wearer will often unknowingly damage or stain their gloves while doing such tasks as twisting a wet door knob or wiping a running nose with a gloved hand.

Leather dress gloves that are worn very tight and possess very short, elasticized wrists, are most often referred to as &quot;cop gloves&quot; or &quot;law enforcement gloves&quot; because of their prevalence as issued duty gloves for many law enforcement agencies. It is common attire in leather subculture and BDSM communities.
* Lambskin is widely used for fashion gloves and it is casual and country gloves. It is the most used material for gloves made in Europe in the known as French style.
* Cowhide is often used for lower-priced gloves. This leather is generally considered too thick and bulky for the majority of glove styles, particularly finer dress gloves. It is, however, used for some casual styles of glove.
* Deerskin has the benefit of great strength and elasticity, but has a more rugged appearance, with more grain on the surface, than &quot;hairsheep&quot;. It is very hard-wearing and heavier in weight.
* Goatskin is occasionally used for gloves. It is hard-wearing but coarser than other leathers and is normally used for cheaper gloves.
* Hairsheep originates from sheep that grow hair, not wool. Hairsheep leather is finer and less bulky than other leathers. Its major benefits are softness of touch, suppleness, strength, and lasting comfort. It is very durable and is particularly suited for the manufacture of dress gloves.
* Peccary is the world&#x27;s rarest and most luxurious gloving leather. Peccary leather is very soft, difficult to sew, and hard-wearing.
* Sheepskin, also called shearling, is widely used for casual and country gloves. It is very warm in cold weather, and as a leather reversed, it has still attached wool on the inside.
* Slink lamb is used only in the most expensive lambskin gloves. Some of the finest lambskin comes from New Zealand.

===Leather glove linings===

* Cashmere is warm, light in weight, and very comfortable to wear. Cashmere yarn comes from the hair of mountain goats, whose fleece allows them to survive the extreme weather conditions they are exposed to.
* Silk is warm in winter and cool in summer and is used both in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gloves, but is more popular in women&#x27;s.
* Wool is well known for its natural warmth and comfort, as well as having a natural elasticity.
* Other linings, which include wool mixtures and acrylics.

====Component parts====
The component parts that may be found in a leather dress glove are one pair of tranks, one pair of thumbs, four whole fourchettes, four half fourchettes, two gussets, and six quirks. Depending on the style of the glove there may also be roller pieces, straps, rollers, eyelets, studs, sockets and domes. Finally, linings will themselves consist of tranks, thumbs and fourchettes.

====Stitching====
The most popular types of leather glove sewing stitches used today are:
* Hand stitched, which is most popular in men&#x27;s gloves and some women&#x27;s styles. Hand stitching is a very time-consuming and skilled process.
* Inseam, which is mainly used on women&#x27;s gloves, but occasionally on men&#x27;s dress gloves.

====Some glove terms====
* &quot;Button length&quot; is the measurement in inches that is used to determine the length/measurement from the base of the glove thumb to the cuff of the glove.
* &quot;Fourchettes&quot; are the inside panels on the fingers of some glove styles.
* &quot;Perforations&quot; are small holes that are punched in the leather. They are often added for better ventilation, grip, or aesthetics and can be as fine as a pin hole.
* &quot;Points&quot; are the three, or sometimes single, line of decorative stitching on the back of the glove.
* &quot;Quirks&quot; are found on only the most expensive hand sewn gloves. They are small diamond shaped pieces of leather sewn at the base of the fingers, where they are attached to the hand of the glove to improve the fit.
* A &quot;strap and roller&quot; is used to adjust the closeness of the fit around the wrist.
* A &quot;Vent&quot; is the V-shaped cut out of the glove, sometimes at the back, but more often on the palm, to give the glove an easier fit around the wrist.

===Driving gloves===
Driving gloves are designed for holding a steering wheel and transmitting the feeling of the road to the driver. They provide a good feel and protect the hands. They are designed to be worn tight and to not interfere with hand movements. The increased grip allows for more control and increased safety at speed.

True driver&#x27;s gloves offer tactile advantages to drivers frequently handling a car near the limits of adhesion. Made of soft leather, drivers gloves are unlined with external seams.
==Safety standards==
Several European standards relate to gloves. These include:
* EN 388: Protective against mechanical risks (abrasion / cut / tear / puncture)
* EN 374: Protective against chemical and microorganisms
* EN 420: General requirements for gloves includes sizing and a number of health and safety aspects including latex protein and chromium levels.
* EN 60903: Electric shock
* EN 407: Heat resistance
* EN 511: Cold resistance
* EN 1149: Antistatic
* EN 10819: Anti Vibration gloves (TRM – Transmission Ratio Medium frequency range, TRH – Transmission Ratio High frequency range)

These exist to fulfill personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements.

==Notable gloves==
Michael Jackson often wore a single jeweled glove on his right hand, which helped develop his signature look. It has been the object of several auctions.

A dark leather glove became an important piece of evidence in the O. J. Simpson murder case. Simpson&#x27;s defense counsel famously quipped &quot;if it doesn&#x27;t fit, you must acquit&quot;. The glove presented as evidence shrank from having been soaked in blood, according to some analysis.

<text>A phonograph record (also known as a gramophone record, especially in British English) or a vinyl record (for later varieties only) is an analog sound storage medium in the form of a flat disc with an inscribed, modulated spiral groove. The groove usually starts near the outside edge and ends near the center of the disc. The stored sound information is made audible by playing the record on a phonograph (or &quot;gramophone&quot;, &quot;turntable&quot;, or &quot;record player&quot;).

Records have been produced in different formats with playing times ranging from a few minutes to around 30 minutes per side. For about half a century, the discs were commonly made from shellac and these records typically ran at a rotational speed of 78 rpm, giving it the nickname &quot;78s&quot; (&quot;seventy-eights&quot;). After the 1940s, &quot;vinyl&quot; records made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) became standard replacing the old 78s and remain so to this day; they have since been produced in various sizes and speeds, most commonly 7-inch discs played at 45 rpm (typically for singles, also called 45s (&quot;forty-fives&quot;)), and 12-inch discs played at 33⅓ rpm (known as an LP, &quot;long-playing records&quot;, typically for full-length albums) – the latter being the most prevalent format today.

==Overview==
The phonograph record was the primary medium used for music reproduction throughout the 20th century. It had co-existed with the phonograph cylinder from the late 1880s and had effectively superseded it by around 1912. Records retained the largest market share even when new formats such as the compact cassette were mass-marketed. By the 1980s, digital media, in the form of the compact disc, had gained a larger market share, and the record left the mainstream in 1991. Since the 1990s, records continue to be manufactured and sold on a smaller scale, and during the 1990s and early 2000s were commonly used by disc jockeys (DJs), especially in dance music genres. They were also listened to by a growing number of audiophiles. The phonograph record has made a niche resurgence in the early 21st century, growing increasingly popular throughout the 2010s and 2020s.
Phonograph records are generally described by their diameter in inches (12-inch, 10-inch, 7-inch), the rotational speed in revolutions per minute (rpm) at which they are played (, , , 45, 78), and their time capacity, determined by their diameter and speed (LP [long play], 12-inch disc,  rpm; EP [extended play], 12-inch disc or 7-inch disc, or 45 rpm; Single, 7-inch or 10-inch disc, 45 or 78 rpm); their reproductive quality, or level of fidelity (high-fidelity, orthophonic, full-range, etc.); and the number of audio channels (mono, stereo, quad, etc.).

The phrase &quot;broken record&quot; refers to a malfunction when the needle skips/jumps back to the previous groove and plays the same section over and over again indefinitely.

=== Naming ===
The various names have included phonograph record (American English), gramophone record (British English), record, vinyl, LP (originally a trademark of Columbia Records), black disc, album, and more informally platter, wax, or liquorice pizza.

==Early development==
Manufacture of disc records began in the late 19th century, at first competing with earlier cylinder records. Price, ease of use and storage made the disc record dominant by the 1910s. The standard format of disc records became known to later generations as &quot;78s&quot; after their playback speed in revolutions per minute, although that speed only became standardized in the late 1920s. In the late 1940s new formats pressed in vinyl, the 45 rpm single and 33 rpm long playing &quot;LP&quot;, were introduced, gradually overtaking the formerly standard &quot;78s&quot; over the next decade. The late 1950s saw the introduction of stereophonic sound on commercial discs.

===Predecessors===

The phonautograph was invented by 1857 by Frenchman Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville. It could not, however, play back recorded sound, as Scott intended for people to read back the tracings, which he called phonautograms. Prior to this, tuning forks had been used in this way to create direct tracings of the vibrations of sound-producing objects, as by English physicist Thomas Young in 1807. 

In 1877, Thomas Edison invented the first phonograph, which etched sound recordings onto phonograph cylinders. Unlike the phonautograph, Edison&#x27;s phonograph could both record and reproduce sound, via two separate needles, one for each function.

===The first disc records===
The first commercially sold disc records were created by Emile Berliner in the 1880s. Emile Berliner improved the quality of recordings while his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson, who owned a machine shop in Camden, New Jersey, eventually improved the mechanism of the gramophone with a spring motor and a speed regulating governor, resulting in a sound quality equal to Edison&#x27;s cylinders. Abandoning Berliner&#x27;s &quot;Gramophone&quot; trademark for legal reasons in the United States, Johnson&#x27;s and Berliner&#x27;s separate companies reorganized in 1901 to form the Victor Talking Machine Company in Camden, New Jersey, whose products would come to dominate the market for several decades.

Berliner&#x27;s Montreal factory, which became the Canadian branch of RCA Victor, still exists. There is a dedicated museum in Montreal for Berliner (Musée des ondes Emile Berliner).

== 78 rpm disc developments ==
===Early speeds===

Early disc recordings were produced in a variety of speeds ranging from 60 to 130 rpm, and a variety of sizes. As early as 1894, Emile Berliner&#x27;s United States Gramophone Company was selling single-sided 7-inch discs with an advertised standard speed of &quot;about 70 rpm&quot;.

One standard audio recording handbook describes speed regulators, or governors, as being part of a wave of improvement introduced rapidly after 1897. A picture of a hand-cranked 1898 Berliner Gramophone shows a governor and says that spring drives had replaced hand drives. It notes that:

The speed regulator was furnished with an indicator that showed the speed when the machine was running so that the records, on reproduction, could be revolved at exactly the same speed...The literature does not disclose why 78 rpm was chosen for the phonograph industry, apparently this just happened to be the speed created by one of the early machines and, for no other reason continued to be used.
In 1912, the Gramophone Company set 78 rpm as their recording standard, based on the average of recordings they had been releasing at the time, and started selling players whose governors had a nominal speed of 78 rpm. By 1925, 78 rpm was becoming standardized across the industry. However, the exact speed differed between places with alternating current electricity supply at 60 hertz (cycles per second, Hz) and those at 50 Hz. Where the mains supply was 60 Hz, the actual speed was 78.26 rpm: that of a 60 Hz stroboscope illuminating 92-bar calibration markings. Where it was 50 Hz, it was 77.92 rpm: that of a 50 Hz stroboscope illuminating 77-bar calibration markings.
At least one attempt to lengthen playing time was made in the early 1920s. World Records produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing&#x27;s patented add-on speed governor.

===Acoustic recording===
Early recordings were made entirely acoustically, the sound was collected by a horn and piped to a diaphragm, which vibrated the cutting stylus. Sensitivity and frequency range were poor, and frequency response was irregular, giving acoustic recordings an instantly recognizable tonal quality. A singer almost had to put their face in the recording horn. A way of reducing resonance was to wrap the recording horn with tape.

Even drums, if planned and placed properly, could be effectively recorded and heard on even the earliest jazz and military band recordings. The loudest instruments such as the drums and trumpets were positioned the farthest away from the collecting horn. Lillian Hardin Armstrong, a member of King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, which recorded at Gennett Records in 1923, remembered that at first Oliver and his young second trumpet, Louis Armstrong, stood next to each other and Oliver&#x27;s horn could not be heard. &quot;They put Louis about fifteen feet over in the corner, looking all sad.&quot;

===Electrical recording===
During the first half of the 1920s, engineers at Western Electric, as well as independent inventors such as Orlando Marsh, developed technology for capturing sound with a microphone, amplifying it with vacuum tubes (known as &quot;valves&quot; in the UK), and then using the amplified signal to drive an electromechanical recording head. Western Electric&#x27;s innovations resulted in a broader and smoother frequency response, which produced a dramatically fuller, clearer and more natural-sounding recording. Soft or distant sounds that were previously impossible to record could now be captured. Volume was now limited only by the groove spacing on the record and the amplification of the playback device. Victor and Columbia licensed the new electrical system from Western Electric and recorded the first electrical discs during the spring of 1925. The first electrically recorded Victor Red Seal record was Chopin&#x27;s &quot;Impromptus&quot; and Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Litanei&quot; performed by pianist Alfred Cortot at Victor&#x27;s studios in Camden, New Jersey.

A 1926 Wanamaker&#x27;s ad in &quot;The New York Times&quot; offers records &quot;by the latest Victor process of electrical recording&quot;. It was recognized as a breakthrough; in 1930, a &quot;Times&quot; music critic stated:
... the time has come for serious musical criticism to take account of performances of great music reproduced by means of the records. To claim that the records have succeeded in exact and complete reproduction of all details of symphonic or operatic performances ... would be extravagant ... [but] the article of today is so far in advance of the old machines as hardly to admit classification under the same name. Electrical recording and reproduction have combined to retain vitality and color in recitals by proxy.

The Orthophonic Victrola had an interior folded exponential horn, a sophisticated design informed by impedance-matching and transmission-line theory, and designed to provide a relatively flat frequency response. Victor&#x27;s first public demonstration of the Orthophonic Victrola on 6 October 1925, at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel was front-page news in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which reported:
The audience broke into applause ... John Philip Sousa [said]: &#x27;[Gentlemen], that is a band. This is the first time I have ever heard music with any soul to it produced by a mechanical talking machine&#x27; ... The new instrument is a feat of mathematics and physics. It is not the result of innumerable experiments, but was worked out on paper in advance of being built in the laboratory ... The new machine has a range of from 100 to 5,000 [cycles per second], or five and a half octaves ... The &#x27;phonograph tone&#x27; is eliminated by the new recording and reproducing process.

Sales of records plummeted precipitously during the early years of the Great Depression of the 1930s, and the entire record industry in America nearly foundered. In 1932, RCA Victor introduced a basic, inexpensive turntable called the Duo Jr., which was designed to be connected to their radio receivers. According to Edward Wallerstein (the general manager of the RCA Victor Division), this device was &quot;instrumental in revitalizing the industry&quot;.

===78 rpm materials===
The production of shellac records continued throughout the 78 rpm era, which lasted until 1948 in industrialized nations.

During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering &quot;De Luxe&quot; transparent red vinylite pressings of some Red Seal classical 78s, at a &quot;de luxe&quot; price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies used various vinyl formulations trademarked as Metrolite, Merco Plastic, and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce &quot;unbreakable&quot; children&#x27;s records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

===78 rpm recording time===
The playing time of a phonograph record is directly proportional to the available groove length divided by the turntable speed. Total groove length in turn depends on how closely the grooves are spaced, in addition to the record diameter. At the beginning of the 20th century, the early discs played for two minutes, the same as cylinder records. The 12-inch disc, introduced by Victor in 1903, increased the playing time to three and a half minutes. Because the standard 10-inch 78 rpm record could hold about three minutes of sound per side, most popular recordings were limited to that duration. For example, when King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, including Louis Armstrong on his first recordings, recorded 13 sides at Gennett Records in Richmond, Indiana, in 1923, one side was 2:09 and four sides were 2:52–2:59.

In January 1938, Milt Gabler started recording for Commodore Records, and to allow for longer continuous performances, he recorded some 12-inch discs. Eddie Condon explained: &quot;Gabler realized that a jam session needs room for development.&quot; The first two 12-inch recordings did not take advantage of their capability: &quot;Carnegie Drag&quot; was 3m 15s; &quot;Carnegie Jump&quot;, 2m 41s. But at the second session, on 30 April, the two 12-inch recordings were longer: &quot;Embraceable You&quot; was 4m 05s; &quot;Serenade to a Shylock&quot;, 4m 32s. Another way to overcome the time limitation was to issue a selection extending to both sides of a single record. Vaudeville stars Gallagher and Shean recorded &quot;Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean&quot;, written by themselves or, allegedly, by Bryan Foy, as two sides of a 10-inch 78 in 1922 for Victor. Longer musical pieces were released as a set of records. In 1903 The Gramophone Company in England made the first complete recording of an opera, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Ernani&quot;, on 40 single-sided discs. 

In 1940, Commodore released Eddie Condon and his Band&#x27;s recording of &quot;A Good Man Is Hard to Find&quot; in four parts, issued on both sides of two 12-inch 78s. The limited duration of recordings persisted from their advent until the introduction of the LP record in 1948. In popular music, the time limit of minutes on a 10-inch 78 rpm record meant that singers seldom recorded long pieces. One exception is Frank Sinatra&#x27;s recording of Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s &quot;Soliloquy&quot;, from &quot;Carousel&quot;, made on 28 May 1946. Because it ran 7m 57s, longer than both sides of a standard 78 rpm 10-inch record, it was released on Columbia&#x27;s Masterwork label (the classical division) as two sides of a 12-inch record.

In the 78 era, classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s, about 4–5 minutes per side. For example, on 10 June 1924, four months after the 12 February premier of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;, George Gershwin recorded an abridged version of the seventeen-minute work with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. It was released on two sides of Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s.

===Record albums===
&quot;Record albums&quot; were originally booklets containing collections of multiple disc records of related material, the name being related to photograph albums or scrap albums. German record company Odeon pioneered the album in 1909 when it released the &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; by Tchaikovsky on four double-sided discs in a specially designed package. It was not until the LP era that an entire album of material could be included on a single record.

===78 rpm releases in the microgroove era===
In 1968, when the hit movie &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; was inspiring revivals of Jazz Age music, Reprise planned to release a series of 78-rpm singles from their artists on their label at the time, called the Reprise Speed Series. Only one disc actually saw release, Randy Newman&#x27;s &quot;I Think It&#x27;s Going to Rain Today&quot;, a track from his self-titled debut album (with &quot;The Beehive State&quot; on the flipside). Reprise did not proceed further with the series due to a lack of sales for the single, and a lack of general interest in the concept.

In 1978, guitarist and vocalist Leon Redbone released a promotional 78-rpm single featuring two songs (&quot;Alabama Jubilee&quot; and &quot;Please Don&#x27;t Talk About Me When I&#x27;m Gone&quot;) from his &quot;Champagne Charlie&quot; album.

In the same vein of Tin Pan Alley revivals, R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders issued a number of 78-rpm singles on their Blue Goose record label. The most familiar of these releases is probably &quot;R. Crumb &amp; His Cheap Suit Serenaders&#x27; Party Record&quot; (1980, issued as a &quot;Red Goose&quot; record on a 12-inch single), with the double-entendre &quot;My Girl&#x27;s Pussy&quot; on the &quot;A&quot; side and the X-rated &quot;Christopher Columbus&quot; on the &quot;B&quot; side.

In the 1990s Rhino Records issued a series of boxed sets of 78-rpm reissues of early rock and roll hits, intended for owners of vintage jukeboxes. The records were made of vinyl, however, and some of the earlier vintage 78-rpm jukeboxes and record players (the ones that were pre-war) were designed with heavy tone arms to play the hard slate-impregnated shellac records of their time. These vinyl Rhino 78s were softer and would be destroyed by old juke boxes and old record players, but play well on newer 78-capable turntables with modern lightweight tone arms and jewel needles.

As a special release for Record Store Day 2011, Capitol re-released The Beach Boys single &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; in the form of a 10-inch 78-rpm record (b/w &quot;Heroes and Villains&quot;). More recently, The Reverend Peyton&#x27;s Big Damn Band has released their tribute to blues guitarist Charley Patton &quot;Peyton on Patton&quot; on both 12-inch LP and 10-inch 78s.

== New sizes and materials after WWII ==


CBS Laboratories had long been at work for Columbia Records to develop a phonograph record that would hold at least 20 minutes per side.

Research began in 1939, was suspended during World War II, and then resumed in 1945. Columbia Records unveiled the LP at a press conference in the Waldorf-Astoria on 21 June 1948, in two formats: in diameter, matching that of 78 rpm singles, and in diameter.

Unwilling to accept and license Columbia&#x27;s system, in February 1949, RCA Victor released the first 45 rpm single, 7 inches in diameter with a large center hole. The 45 rpm player included a changing mechanism that allowed multiple disks to be stacked, much as a conventional changer handled 78s. Also like 78s, the short playing time of a single 45 rpm side meant that long works, such as symphonies and operas, had to be released on multiple 45s instead of a single LP, but RCA Victor claimed that the new high-speed changer rendered side breaks so brief as to be inconsequential. Early 45 rpm records were made from either vinyl or polystyrene. They had a playing time of eight minutes.

At first the two systems were marketed in competition, in what was called &quot;The War of the Speeds&quot;. 

=== Speeds ===
====Shellac era====
The older 78 rpm format continued to be mass-produced alongside the newer formats using new materials in decreasing numbers until the summer of 1958 in the U.S., and in a few countries, such as the Philippines and India (both countries issued recordings by the Beatles on 78s), into the late 1960s. For example, Columbia Records&#x27; last reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 78 rpm records was an album called &quot;Young at Heart&quot;, issued in November 1954.

====Microgroove and vinyl era====
Columbia and RCA Victor each pursued their R&amp;D secretly. 

The commercial rivalry between RCA Victor and Columbia Records led to RCA Victor&#x27;s introduction of what it had intended to be a competing vinyl format, the 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc, with a much larger center hole. For a two-year period from 1948 to 1950, record companies and consumers faced uncertainty over which of these formats would ultimately prevail in what was known as the &quot;War of the Speeds&quot; (see also Format war). In 1949 Capitol and Decca adopted the new LP format and RCA Victor gave in and issued its first LP in January 1950. The 45 rpm size was gaining in popularity, too, and Columbia issued its first 45s in February 1951. By 1954, 200 million 45s had been sold.

Eventually the 12-inch (300 mm)  rpm LP prevailed as the dominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch LPs were no longer issued. The last Columbia Records reissue of any Frank Sinatra songs on a 10-inch LP record was an album called &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, CL 2600, issued on 26 October 1956, containing six songs, one each by Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Johnnie Ray, Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, and Frankie Laine.

The 45 rpm discs also came in a variety known as extended play (EP), which achieved up to 10–15 minutes play at the expense of attenuating (and possibly compressing) the sound to reduce the width required by the groove. EP discs were cheaper to produce and were used in cases where unit sales were likely to be more limited or to reissue LP albums on the smaller format for those people who had only 45 rpm players. LP albums could be purchased one EP at a time, with four items per EP, or in a boxed set with three EPs or twelve items. The large center hole on 45s allows easier handling by jukebox mechanisms. EPs were generally discontinued by the late 1950s in the U.S. as three- and four-speed record players replaced the individual 45 players. One indication of the decline of the 45 rpm EP is that the last Columbia Records reissue of Frank Sinatra songs on 45 rpm EP records, called &quot;Frank Sinatra&quot; (Columbia B-2641) was issued on 7 December 1959.

The Seeburg Corporation introduced the Seeburg Background Music System in 1959, using a  rpm 9-inch record with 2-inch center hole. Each record held 40 minutes of music per side, recorded at 420 grooves per inch.

From the mid-1950s through the 1960s, in the U.S. the common home record player or &quot;stereo&quot; (after the introduction of stereo recording) would typically have had these features: a three- or four-speed player (78, 45, , and sometimes  rpm); with changer, a tall spindle that would hold several records and automatically drop a new record on top of the previous one when it had finished playing, a combination cartridge with both 78 and microgroove styli and a way to flip between the two; and some kind of adapter for playing the 45s with their larger center hole. The adapter could be a small solid circle that fit onto the bottom of the spindle (meaning only one 45 could be played at a time) or a larger adapter that fit over the entire spindle, permitting a stack of 45s to be played.

RCA Victor 45s were also adapted to the smaller spindle of an LP player with a plastic snap-in insert known as a &quot;45 rpm adapter&quot;. These inserts were commissioned by RCA president David Sarnoff and were invented by Thomas Hutchison.

Capacitance Electronic Discs were videodiscs invented by RCA, based on mechanically tracked ultra-microgrooves (9541 grooves/inch) on a 12-inch conductive vinyl disc.

===High fidelity===
The term &quot;high fidelity&quot; was coined in the 1920s by some manufacturers of radio receivers and phonographs to differentiate their better-sounding products claimed as providing &quot;perfect&quot; sound reproduction. The term began to be used by some audio engineers and consumers through the 1930s and 1940s. After 1949 a variety of improvements in recording and playback technologies, especially stereo recordings, which became widely available in 1958, gave a boost to the &quot;hi-fi&quot; classification of products, leading to sales of individual components for the home such as amplifiers, loudspeakers, phonographs, and tape players. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;Audio&quot; were two magazines that hi-fi consumers and engineers could read for reviews of playback equipment and recordings.

===Stereophonic sound===
A stereophonic phonograph provides two channels of audio, one left and one right. This is achieved by adding another vertical dimension of movement to the needle in addition to the horizontal one. As a result, the needle now moves not only left and right, but also up and down. But since those two dimensions do not have the same sensitivity to vibration, the difference needs to be evened out by having each channel take half its information from each direction by turning the channels 45 degrees from horizontal.

As a result of the 45-degree turn and some vector addition, it can be demonstrated that out of the new horizontal and vertical directions, one would represent the sum of the two channels, and the other representing the difference. Record makers decide to pick the directions such that the traditional horizontal direction codes for the sum. As a result, an ordinary mono disk is decoded correctly as &quot;no difference between channels&quot;, and an ordinary mono player would simply play the sum of a stereophonic record without too much loss of information.

In 1957 the first commercial stereo two-channel records were issued first by Audio Fidelity followed by a translucent blue vinyl on Bel Canto Records, the first of which was a multi-colored-vinyl sampler featuring A Stereo Tour of Los Angeles narrated by Jack Wagner on one side, and a collection of tracks from various Bel Canto albums on the back.

===Noise reduction systems===
A similar scheme aiming at the high-end audiophile market, and achieving a noise reduction of about 20 to 25 dB(A), was the Telefunken/Nakamichi High-Com II noise reduction system being adapted to vinyl in 1979. A decoder was commercially available but only one demo record is known to have been produced in this format.

The availability of encoded disks in any of these formats stopped in the mid-1980s.

Yet another noise reduction system for vinyl records was the UC compander system developed by (ZWT) of (RFT). The system deliberately reduced disk noise by 10 to 12 dB(A) only to remain virtually free of recognizable acoustical artifacts even when records were played back without an UC expander. In fact, the system was undocumented yet introduced into the market by several East-German record labels since 1983. Over 500 UC-encoded titles were produced without an expander becoming available to the public. The only UC expander was built into a turntable manufactured by .

==Formats==
===Types of records===
The usual diameters of the holes on an EP record are .

Sizes of records in the United States and the UK are generally measured in inches, e.g. 7-inch records, which are generally 45 rpm records. LPs were 10-inch records at first, but soon the 12-inch size became by far the most common. Generally, 78s were 10-inch, but 12-inch and 7-inch and even smaller were made—the so-called &quot;little wonders&quot;.

===Standard formats===


: Notes:
===Less common formats===

Flexi discs were thin flexible records that were distributed with magazines and as promotional gifts from the 1960s to the 1980s.

In March 1949, as RCA Victor released the 45, Columbia released several hundred 7-inch,  rpm, small-spindle-hole singles. This format was soon dropped as it became clear that the RCA Victor 45 was the single of choice and the Columbia 12-inch LP would be the album of choice. 
The first release of the 45 came in seven colors: black 47-xxxx popular series, yellow 47-xxxx juvenile series, green (teal) 48-xxxx country series, deep red 49-xxxx classical series, bright red (cerise) 50-xxxx blues/spiritual series, light blue 51-xxxx international series, dark blue 52-xxxx light classics. Most colors were soon dropped in favor of black because of production problems. However, yellow and deep red were continued until about 1952.
The first 45 rpm record created for sale was &quot;PeeWee the Piccolo&quot; RCA Victor 47-0147 pressed in yellow translucent vinyl at the Sherman Avenue plant, Indianapolis on 7 December 1948, by R. O. Price, plant manager.

In the 1950s and 1960s Ribs were created within Soviet Union countries as a result of cultural censorship. These black market records were of banned music, printed onto x-ray films scavenged from hospital bins. 

In the 1970s, the government of Bhutan produced now-collectible postage stamps on playable vinyl mini-discs.

=== Recent developments ===
In 2018, an Austrian startup, Rebeat Innovation GmBH, received 4.8 million in funding to develop high definition vinyl records that purport to contain longer play times, louder volumes and higher fidelity than conventional vinyl LPs. Rebeat Innovation, headed by CEO Günter Loibl, has called the format &#x27;HD Vinyl&#x27;. The HD process works by converting audio to a digital 3D topography map that is then inscribed onto the vinyl stamper via lasers, resulting in less loss of information. Many critics have expressed skepticism regarding the cost and quality of HD records.

In May 2019, at the Making Vinyl conference in Berlin, Loibl unveiled the software &quot;Perfect Groove&quot; for creating 3D topographic audio data files. The software provides a map for laser-engraving for HD Vinyl stampers. The audio engineering software was created with mastering engineers Scott Hull and Darcy Proper, a four-time Grammy winner. The demonstration offered the first simulations of what HD Vinyl records are likely to sound like, ahead of actual HD vinyl physical record production. Loibl discussed the software &quot;Perfect Groove&quot; at a presentation titled &quot;Vinyl 4.0 The next generation of making records&quot; before offering demonstrations to attendees.

==Structure==

Increasingly from the early 20th century, and almost exclusively since the 1920s, both sides of the record have been used to carry the grooves. Occasional records have been issued since then with a recording on only one side. In the 1980s Columbia records briefly issued a series of less expensive one-sided 45 rpm singles.

Since its inception in 1948, vinyl record standards for the United States follow the guidelines of the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

===Vinyl quality===
The composition of vinyl used to press records (a blend of polyvinyl chloride and polyvinyl acetate) has varied considerably over the years. Virgin vinyl is preferred, but during the 1970s energy crisis, as a cost-cutting move, much of the industry began reducing the thickness and quality of vinyl used in mass-market manufacturing. Sound quality suffered, with increased ticks, pops, and other surface noises. RCA Records marketed their lightweight LP as Dynaflex, which, at the time, was considered inferior by many record collectors.

It became commonplace to use recycled vinyl. New or &quot;virgin&quot; heavy/heavyweight (180–220 g) vinyl is commonly used for modern audiophile vinyl releases in all genres. Many collectors prefer to have heavyweight vinyl albums, which have been reported to have better sound than normal vinyl because of their higher tolerance against deformation caused by normal play.

Following the vinyl revival of the 21st century, select manufacturers adopted bioplastic-based records due to concerns over the environmental impact of widespread PVC use.

==Limitations==
=== Shellac ===
One problem with shellac was that the size of the disks tended to be larger because it was limited to 80–100 groove walls per inch before the risk of groove collapse became too high, whereas vinyl could have up to 260 groove walls per inch.

===Vinyl===

Although vinyl records are strong and do not break easily, they scratch due to its soft material sometimes resulting in ruining the record. Vinyl readily acquires a static charge, attracting dust that is difficult to remove completely. Dust and scratches cause audio clicks and pops. In extreme cases, they can cause the needle to skip over a series of grooves, or worse yet, cause the needle to skip backward, creating a &quot;locked groove&quot; that repeats over and over. This is the origin of the phrase &quot;like a broken record&quot; or &quot;like a scratched record&quot;, which is often used to describe a person or thing that continually repeats itself.
A further limitation of the gramophone record is that fidelity steadily declines as playback progresses; there is more vinyl per second available for fine reproduction of high frequencies at the large-diameter beginning of the groove than exist at the smaller diameters close to the end of the side. At the start of a groove on an LP there are 510 mm of vinyl per second traveling past the stylus while the ending of the groove gives 200–210 mm of vinyl per second—less than half the linear resolution.

There is controversy about the relative quality of CD sound and LP sound when the latter is heard under the best conditions (see Comparison of analog and digital recording). One technical advantage with vinyl compared to the optical CD is that if correctly handled and stored, the vinyl record can be playable for decades and possibly centuries, which is longer than some versions of the optical CD. For vinyl records to be playable for years to come, they need to be handled with care and stored properly. Guidelines for proper vinyl storage include not stacking records on top of each other, avoiding heat or direct sunlight and placing them in a temperature-controlled area that help prevent vinyl records from warping and scratching. Collectors store their records in a variety of boxes, cubes, shelves and racks.

===Sound fidelity===
At the time of the introduction of the compact disc (CD) in 1982, the stereo LP pressed in vinyl continued to suffer from a variety of limitations:

The stereo image was not made up of fully discrete left and right channels; each channel&#x27;s signal coming out of the cartridge contained a small amount of the signal from the other channel, with more crosstalk at higher frequencies. High-quality disc cutting equipment was capable of making a master disc with 30–40 dB of stereo separation at 1,000 Hz, but the playback cartridges had lesser performance of about 20 to 30 dB of separation at 1000 Hz, with separation decreasing as frequency increased, such that at 12 kHz the separation was about 10–15 dB. A common modern view is that stereo isolation must be higher than this to achieve a proper stereo soundstage. However, in the 1950s the BBC determined in a series of tests that only 20–25 dB is required for the impression of full stereo separation.

Thin, closely spaced spiral grooves that allow for increased playing time on a  rpm microgroove LP lead to a tinny pre-echo warning of upcoming loud sounds. The cutting stylus unavoidably transfers some of the subsequent groove wall&#x27;s impulse signal into the previous groove wall. It is discernible by some listeners throughout certain recordings, but a quiet passage followed by a loud sound allows anyone to hear a faint pre-echo of the loud sound occurring 1.8 seconds ahead of time.

===LP versus CD===

Audiophiles have differed over the relative merits of the LP versus the CD since the digital disc was introduced. Digital sampling can theoretically completely reproduce a sound wave within a given range of frequencies if the sampling rate is high enough. Vinyl&#x27;s drawbacks, however, include surface noise, less resolution due to a lower dynamic range, and greater sensitivity to handling. Modern anti-aliasing filters and oversampling systems used in digital recordings have eliminated perceived problems observed with early CD players.

There is a theory that vinyl records can audibly represent higher frequencies than compact discs, though most of this is noise and not relevant to human hearing. According to Red Book specifications, the compact disc has a frequency response of 20 Hz up to 22,050 Hz, and most CD players measure flat within a fraction of a decibel from at least 0 Hz to 20 kHz at full output. Due to the distance required between grooves, it is not possible for an LP to reproduce as low frequencies as a CD. Additionally, turntable rumble and acoustic feedback obscures the low-end limit of vinyl but the upper end can be, with some cartridges, reasonably flat within a few decibels to 30 kHz, with gentle roll-off. Carrier signals of Quad LPs popular in the 1970s were at 30 kHz to be out of the range of human hearing. The average human auditory system is sensitive to frequencies from 20 Hz to a maximum of around 20,000 Hz. The upper and lower frequency limits of human hearing vary per person. High frequency sensitivity decreases as a person ages, a process called presbycusis.

==Preservation==

As the playing of gramophone records causes gradual degradation of the recording, they are best preserved by transferring them onto other media and playing the records as rarely as possible. They need to be stored on edge, and do best under environmental conditions that most humans would find comfortable. The longevity and optimal performance of vinyl records can be improved through certain accessories and cleaning supplies. Slipmats provide a soft and cushioned surface between the record and the turntable platter, minimizing friction and preventing potential scratches or damage to the vinyl surface.

Where old disc recordings are considered to be of artistic or historic interest, from before the era of tape or where no tape master exists, archivists play back the disc on suitable equipment and record the result, typically onto a digital format, which can be copied and manipulated to remove analog flaws without any further damage to the source recording. For example, Nimbus Records uses a specially built horn record player to transfer 78s. Anyone can do this using a standard record player with a suitable pickup, a phono-preamp (pre-amplifier) and a typical personal computer. However, for accurate transfer, professional archivists carefully choose the correct stylus shape and diameter, tracking weight, equalisation curve and other playback parameters and use high-quality analogue-to-digital converters.

As an alternative to playback with a stylus, a recording can be read optically, processed with software that calculates the velocity that the stylus would be moving in the mapped grooves and converted to a digital recording format. This does no further damage to the disc and generally produces a better sound than normal playback. This technique also has the potential to allow for reconstruction of broken or otherwise damaged discs.

==Popularity and current status==

Groove recordings, first designed in the final quarter of the 19th century, held a predominant position for nearly a century—withstanding competition from reel-to-reel tape, the 8-track cartridge, and the compact cassette. The widespread popularity of Sony&#x27;s Walkman was a factor that contributed to the vinyl&#x27;s lessening usage in the 1980s. 

In 1988, the compact disc surpassed the gramophone record in unit sales. Vinyl records experienced a sudden decline in popularity between 1988 and 1991, when the major label distributors restricted their return policies, which retailers had been relying on to maintain and swap out stocks of relatively unpopular titles. First the distributors began charging retailers more for new products if they returned unsold vinyl, and then they stopped providing any credit at all for returns. Retailers, fearing they would be stuck with anything they ordered, only ordered proven, popular titles that they knew would sell, and devoted more shelf space to CDs and cassettes. Record companies also removed many vinyl titles from production and distribution, further undermining the availability of the format and leading to the closure of pressing plants. This rapid decline in the availability of records accelerated the format&#x27;s decline in popularity, and is seen by some as a deliberate ploy to make consumers switch to CDs, which unlike today, were more profitable for the record companies.

The more modern CD format held numerous advantages over the record such as its portability, digital audio and its elimination of background hiss and surface noise, instant switching and searching of tracks, longer playing time, lack of continuous degradation (analog formats wear out as they get played), programmability (e.g. shuffle, repeat), and ability to be played on and copied to a personal computer. In spite of their flaws, records continued to have enthusiastic supporters, partly due to a preference of its &quot;warmer&quot; sound and its larger sleeve artwork. Records continued to be format of choice by disc jockeys in dance clubs during the 1990s and 2000s due to its better mixing capabilities.

=== Revival era ===
A niche resurgence of vinyl records began in the late 2000s, mainly among rock fans. The Entertainment Retailers Association in the United Kingdom found in 2011 that consumers were willing to pay on average £16.30 (€19.37, US$25.81) for a single vinyl record, as opposed to £7.82 (€9.30, US$12.38) for a CD and £6.80 (€8.09, US$10.76) for a digital download. The resurgence accelerated throughout the 2010s, and in 2015 reached $416 million revenue in the US, their highest level since 1988. As of 2017, it comprised 14% of all physical album sales. According to the RIAA&#x27;s midyear report in 2020, phonograph record revenues surpassed those of CDs for the first time since the 1980s.

In 2021, Taylor Swift sold 102,000 copies of her ninth studio album &quot;Evermore&quot; on vinyl in one week. The sales of the record beat the largest sales in one week on vinyl since Nielsen started tracking vinyl sales in 1991. The sales record was previously held by Jack White, who sold 40,000 copies of his second solo release, &quot;Lazaretto&quot;, on vinyl in its first week of release in 2014.

Approximately 180 million LP records are produced annually at global pressing plants, as of 2021.

===Present production===

, 48 record pressing facilities exist worldwide. The increased popularity of the record has led to the investment in new and modern record-pressing machines. Only two producers of lacquer master discs remain: Apollo Masters in California, and MDC in Japan. On 6 February 2020, a fire destroyed the Apollo Masters plant. According to the Apollo Masters website, their future is still uncertain. Hand Drawn Pressing opened in 2016 as the world&#x27;s first fully automated record pressing plant.

<text>Cybill is an American television sitcom created by Chuck Lorre, which aired for four seasons and 87 episodes on CBS from January 2, 1995, to July 13, 1998. Starring Cybill Shepherd, the show revolves around the life of Cybill Sheridan, a twice-divorced single mother of two and struggling actress in her 40s who has never gotten her big break in show business. Alicia Witt and Dedee Pfeiffer co-starred as Sheridan&#x27;s daughters, with Alan Rosenberg and Tom Wopat playing their respective fathers, while Christine Baranski appeared as Cybill&#x27;s hard-drinking friend Maryann.

The sitcom was produced by Chuck Lorre Productions and YBYL Productions in association with Carsey-Werner Productions, with Shepherd, Lorre, Howard M. Gould, Jay Daniel, Caryn Mandabach, Marcy Carsey, and Tom Werner serving as the show&#x27;s original executive producers. Broadcast to critical praise, &quot;Cybill&quot; was nominated for 12 Emmy Awards throughout its run and awarded the 1996 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. Shepherd won a third Golden Globe Award for her performance, while Baranski received an Emmy, a Screen Actors Guild Award, and an American Comedy Award. &quot;Cybill&quot; has been in syndication on the comedy-centric digital subchannel Laff since April 2016, along with other Carsey-Werner Productions series shown on the network.

==Plot==
&quot;Cybill&quot; takes place in Los Angeles and focuses on the character of a somewhat faded actress, Cybill Sheridan (played by Cybill Shepherd), who, because of her age, had been relegated to playing character roles, bit parts, and TV commercials. Also featured are her daughters: headstrong Zoey (Witt) and uptight Rachel (Pfeiffer), two ex-husbands: Ira (Rosenberg) and Jeff (Wopat), and her hard-drinking best friend Maryann (Baranski).

Due to the show&#x27;s premise, many episodes featured a show-within-a-show format, usually in the cold opens, showing Cybill Sheridan playing a variety of other characters in her various film and TV acting roles.

In her autobiography, &quot;Cybill Disobedience&quot;, Shepherd stated that the Cybill character was based on herself—or at least what her life as an actress could have been without the successes of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. Many of the show&#x27;s details and situations were mined from her own family, marriages, and experiences.

==Cast and characters==

=== Regular and semi-regular ===
* Cybill Shepherd as Cybill Sheridan – Cybill is a middle aged actress who has had a varied, though mediocre career (which, even in her salad days, seems to have consisted primarily of television commercials, soap operas, and B-movies). She now finds that, due to her age, roles are becoming harder to find and that the quality of roles she is offered is diminishing. Her fortunes seem to vary over the course of the series. Sometimes, she has consistent work and appears to be relatively wealthy, other times, she scrambles to find and keep jobs, and seems to be struggling financially; this inconsistency could be attributed to the nature of her career, as even the most successful actors tend to have their professional ups and downs, both financially and creatively. Cybill is a rather eccentric feminist who practices New Age philosophy, as well as a native Southerner from Memphis, Tennessee. Her loud, public, and honest rantings about female sexuality, her perkiness, bouts of outrage, and hysteria, and her exhibitions of &quot;down-home&quot; Southern behavior often embarrass her two daughters, Zoey and Rachel. Cybill has a civil relationship with her ex-husbands Jeff and Ira, even tolerating their tendency to cling to her. She does sometimes spar, however, with Jeff over his past infidelities, and is quick to remind Ira of how controlling he was when they were married. Cybill&#x27;s best friend is the wealthy, alcoholic divorcee Maryann Thorpe, whom she supports emotionally and assists in her bitter war with her ex-husband. Cybill has a caustic sense of humor and an acid tongue. Although eccentric and flawed, Cybill&#x27;s strength and wisdom shines through in her support of her family and friends. (87 episodes)
* Christine Baranski as Maryann Thorpe – Cybill&#x27;s best friend is a former receptionist who is now fabulously wealthy due to her divorce settlement with her unfaithful ex-husband, celebrity plastic surgeon Richard Thorpe (an infrequently and never fully seen character, to whom she always refers with a sneer as &quot;Dr. Dick&quot;). Maryann is a bored, bitter alcoholic who often seems unstable and emotionally dependent on Cybill. When she is not stalking her ex-husband and playing elaborate and destructive pranks on him, she spends lavishly, drinks, and pursues younger men. She has a few healthy relationships with men of her own age over the course of the series, including Cybill&#x27;s ex-husband Ira, but these do not last. She has a son, Justin, who infrequently visits. A passionate environmentalist with excessive liberal beliefs, Justin is at odds with her frivolous and extravagant lifestyle. Maryann&#x27;s most consistent and healthy relationship is with Cybill. They seem to be endlessly sharing martinis in an upmarket Hollywood restaurant and are accomplices in each other&#x27;s bad behavior. Maryann seems to spend most of her time at Cybill&#x27;s house and involving herself in Cybill&#x27;s family life to alleviate her own boredom. Her caustic tongue vies with Cybill&#x27;s, but her remarks are more inappropriate, bitter, and cynical. She is, however, a constant support for Cybill at crucial moments. Her first name was Theresa, which her mother called her but she dropped when she moved to Los Angeles. (87 episodes)
* Alicia Witt as Zoey Woodbine – Cybill&#x27;s younger daughter, she is a high-school teenager, and is brilliant, rebellious, and more sarcastic than her mother. She is a piano virtuoso (as is Witt) and hopes to attend the Los Angeles Conservatory of Music. A self-imposed outcast, she is a vocal advocate of celibacy. She is in an on-again-off-again relationship with Maryann&#x27;s estranged son. (87 episodes)
* Alan Rosenberg as Ira Woodbine – Cybill&#x27;s second husband, Ira is the polar opposite of Cybill&#x27;s first husband, Jeff. Unassuming and rather neurotic, he is a brilliant writer, though prone to &quot;writer&#x27;s block&quot;. His marriage to Cybill ended because he was unable to stop trying to control her life; even in divorce, he cannot help meddling in her life. For several episodes of the second season he was involved with Maryann. (85 episodes)
* Dedee Pfeiffer as Rachel Robbins Manning – Cybill&#x27;s elder daughter, she is uptight and pretentious, and is married to Kevin Manning. She is prone to outbursts of hysteria similar to her mother&#x27;s, especially during her pregnancies of the first and fourth season. Rachel and Kevin&#x27;s first child is a boy named William; the second is a girl, Amanda. (Initially a regular but the role became more semi-regular in later seasons) (42 episodes)
*Tom Wopat as Jeff Robbins – Cybill&#x27;s first husband, Jeff is a Hollywood stuntman with a roving eye. Though his many indiscretions were the cause of the divorce, Cybill and Jeff still have a good relationship, bound together by their daughter and grandson (and the fact that Jeff lived over Cybill&#x27;s garage in the early seasons of the show). Jeff is somewhat dim, making him a prime target for Zoey&#x27;s dry wit, but possesses a good heart. (Initially a regular in first couple of seasons, semi-regular in later seasons) (22 episodes)

=== Recurring and special guests ===

* Tim Maculan as a waiter and friend of Cybill&#x27;s. Despite his prominence, the character was never given a name. Appeared in over 50 episodes (the fifth-most appearing cast member with more episodes than some of the semi-regular cast).
* Peter Krause as Kevin Manning, Rachel&#x27;s equally uptight husband, an untenured assistant professor from Boston. (Recurring from Season 2 onwards) (23 episodes)
*Jay Paulson as Sean, Zoe&#x27;s first boyfriend in Season 2 &amp; 3. (Recurring) (12 episodes)
*Ray Baker as the second Dr. Richard Thorpe, Maryann&#x27;s veterinarian boyfriend who is also the namesake of her ex-husband. (Recurring in Seasons 3 &amp; 4) (11 episodes)
*Jane Kaczmarek as Holly, Ira&#x27;s girlfriend - and later fiancee - in Season 3. (5 episodes)
*Linda Wallem appeared in 5 episodes as various characters including Julie, Cybill&#x27;s co-host on a morning show in 3 episodes. Wallem was also a producer and writer on the show.
*Mary Page Keller as Julia Bishop, Zoey&#x27;s piano teacher and Ira&#x27;s girlfriend. (4 episodes)
*Kim Murphy as Nina, Zoey&#x27;s friend and one-time roommate. (4 episodes)
*Morgan Fairchild as Andrea Thorpe, Cybill&#x27;s rival and later wife of Maryann&#x27;s often mentioned but never seen husband, Dr. Dick. She and Cybill have mutual enmity which has resulted in personal humiliations, professional loss, and injury on both sides. (4 episodes)
*Audra Lindley as Virginia Sheridan, Cybill&#x27;s mother. (3 episodes and another episode dedicated in her honour)
*Florence Stanley as Ruth Woodbine, Ira&#x27;s mother and Zoey&#x27;s grandmother, who had a friendly relationship with Cybill and once posed as Maryann&#x27;s mother. (3 episodes)
*Eileen Heckart as Marge, Maryann&#x27;s mother. (3 episodes)
*Dick O&#x27;Neill as Roy, Maryann&#x27;s father. (3 episodes)

Additionally, many prominent actors appeared playing themselves, often humorous or self-deprecating caricatures of their real personas. These included Jonathan Frakes, Joan Van Ark, Dick Van Patten, Burt Reynolds, and Cybill Shepherd&#x27;s real-life ex-partner, director Peter Bogdanovich.

== Cancellation ==
The series got respectable (though never spectacular) ratings throughout most of its run, but was abruptly canceled by CBS at the end of the 1997–98 season after a noticeable ratings decline. The show was actually pulled from the CBS schedule after the April 8, 1998, episode had aired; the remaining new episodes that had already been produced were aired over the summer. Shepherd much later alleged that the cancellation occurred because the network was uncomfortable with &quot;Cybill&quot;&#x27;s feminist leanings and frank depiction of female sexuality.

The cancellation was not expected by the show&#x27;s staff, as the series ends with a cliffhanger and the words &quot;To Be Continued...&quot; on the screen. At the time of its cancellation, the show&#x27;s ratings were higher than &quot;Nash Bridges&quot; (1996–2001) and &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; (1994–2000); those shows continued to air on CBS. In 2018, Shepherd claimed that Les Moonves hit on her during a dinner date, but she refused him. As a result, she said, he soon interfered with the series&#x27; concepts, and ultimately canceled the show.

== Awards and nominations ==

&quot;Cybill&quot; was nominated for twelve Emmy Awards throughout its entire run, winning three. Nominated for her performance in each season, Baranski was the only cast member to win an Emmy. Baranski also received an American Comedy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Viewers for Quality Television Award for her portrayal, while Shepherd was awarded the 1996 Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy. The same year, the sitcom also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy, its only win for both the crew and the cast.

<text>Luis Vigoreaux Rivera (April 12, 1928 – January 17, 1983) was a Puerto Rican radio and television show host, announcer, comedian and producer. Vigoreaux was considered a pioneer in the television business in Puerto Rico, and enjoyed success with several radio and television shows throughout his career.

Vigoreaux was brutally murdered on January 17, 1983. His wife, Lydia Echevarría, was convicted in 1986 of planning the murder, along with hitmen Papo Newman and David López-Watts.

==Early years==

Vigoreaux was born on April 12, 1928, in the Chupacallos ward of Ceiba, Puerto Rico. He was one of the eight children of Eulalia Rivera and Enrique Vigoreaux, a sugarcane worker at Fajardo Sugar Company. His father died when he was young, forcing Eulalia to take charge of the family. When Vigoreaux was 14 years old, they moved to San Juan, specifically Río Piedras. Vigoreaux studied at the Vila Mayo High School.

As a teenager, Vigoreaux found work in a radio station named WIAC (AM), which was managed by Tomás Muñiz (father of Tommy Muñiz). There, Vigoreaux worked on a show called &quot;Alma Estudiantil&quot;. With the beginning of World War II, most of the professional hosts were enlisted for war, which led to Vigoreaux having the opportunity to work at the station.

During that period, Vigoreaux worked in various areas of entertainment and show business. He served as host, presenter, commentator, among other jobs. He also became the spokesperson for Sello Rojo rice in Puerto Rico, which he did for 30 years.

==First years in comedy==
Vigoreaux joined Ramón Rivero &quot;Diplo&quot; and José Luis Torregrosa for the radio comedy &quot;El Tremendo Hotel&quot;. This radio slot enjoyed a large audience for years, and Vigoreaux continued to work as a comedian.

Between 1954 and 1955, he joined fellow comedian José Miguel Agrelot in a theater show that took them to many Latin American communities in the United States. The theater show eventually led to a radio program named &quot;Torito and Company&quot;, after &quot;Torito&quot;, the character that Agrelot played. Vigoreaux himself played the character of Don Toribio.

==Arrival of television==
With the arrival of television to Puerto Rico in 1954, Vigoreaux began his transition hosting a show called &quot;El Show Libby&#x27;s&quot;, sponsored by the company of its namesake. He then hosted the show &quot;El tren de la alegría&quot;.

Vigoreaux later moved to WAPA-TV, motivated by the possibility of working with actor Mario Pabón. They wrote the story for a soap opera, but the project fell through. However, Vigoreaux moved on when he and his second wife, Lydia Echevarria, began hosting the show named &quot;La Hora Cero&quot;. The show presented many local and international singers, including Celia Cruz, José Feliciano and Marco Antonio Muñiz.

==Success in television==
The Vigoreaux family became one of the most famous families in Puerto Rico. Some even referred to the Vigoreaux-Echevarria couple as the &quot;Lucy and Desi&quot; of Puerto Rico, in reference to the marriage of American comedians Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz.

In 1970, Vigoreaux developed a game show named &quot;Sube Nene, Sube&quot;. Hosted by Vigoreaux it became one of the most seen shows in Puerto Rican television history. Due to this success, WAPA-TV asked Vigoreaux to produce and host a few more game shows. Vigoreaux responded by creating &quot;Pa&#x27;rriba, Papi, Pa&#x27;rriba&quot;, which was a variation of &quot;Sube Nene, Sube&quot;, and &quot;Dale que Dale en Domingo&quot;.

With the production and hosting of all those shows at the same time, the Vigoreaux family opened a studio, which they named &quot;Estudio CVC&quot;. They were also responsible for the transmission of the MDA television marathon in Puerto Rico.

==Brief change to Channel 11 and return to WAPA==
Vigoreaux later jumped to Channel 11, then named the Perez-Perry Network. He bought the &quot;Teatro Nuevo San Juan&quot;, from where he started transmitting his new show. But this show was not as successful, and soon Vigoreaux found himself off the air.

In 1980, Vigoreaux went back to WAPA-TV and all his shows were rescheduled. He also became the show host of that station&#x27;s lunch hour variety show, &quot;El Show Del Mediodia&quot;, and began playing the role of Pedro Navaja in a play &quot;La Verdadera Historia de Pedro Navaja&quot;. He would act in that play many times, as well as in a play named &quot;Angeles Caidos&quot;.

In addition, he returned to the radio with a program named &quot;Buenos Dias, Puerto Rico&quot;, on radio station WBMJ-AM, Radio Rock, and worked, for a short period of time, as a television reporter for &quot;Noticentro 4&quot;.

==Murder and aftermath==
On the morning of January 18, 1983, Vigoreaux didn&#x27;t show up to work at the radio station or at WAPA-TV, causing his co-workers to worry. When his Mercedes-Benz was found with a burned body inside, it was taken to the medical examiner&#x27;s office, where it was confirmed it was Vigoreaux.

His death launched a wave of rumors and speculations, and led to one of the biggest trials in Puerto Rico&#x27;s history. His wife, Lydia Echevarría, was accused formally of his murder, along with Papo Newman and David López-Watts. Allegedly, Echevarría had become jealous of a relationship Vigoreaux had started with actress Nydia Castillo, and had paid Newman and López-Watts to either beat him or murder him. Vigoreaux&#x27;s body was found gagged, stabbed, and burned inside the car&#x27;s trunk.

Echevarría has maintained her innocence, but she was convicted to a life sentence in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. Newman and López-Watts received similar sentences. However, Echevarría and López-Watts only served roughly 12 years in jail. Papo Newman received immunity from the Department of Justice of Puerto Rico to testify in court what happened the night of the murder. Newman did not serve time in prison as an agreement. In January 2000, Governor Pedro Rosselló granted Echevarría a pardon, which was largely criticized by the people.

At the time of his death, Vigoreaux was about to begin another game show, &quot;A Millon&quot;, which eventually became one of the most popular shows in Puerto Rican television history, under the hosting of Hector Marcano and produced by Vigoreaux&#x27;s son, Luisito Vigoreaux.

==Personal life==
Vigoreaux was married twice. He married Rosaura Lorenzana, with whom he had three sons, Luisito, Jorge Enrique and Roberto Vigoreaux. Jorge died in 1962 of leukemia. Luisito has followed his father&#x27;s footsteps as an actor, comedian, producer, and host. Roberto also worked as an actor, host, producer, and singer. He also served as a member of both the House and the Senate of Puerto Rico.

In 1958, Vigoreaux met actress Lydia Echevarría, while still married to his first wife. After divorcing, they married on February 10, 1960. He and Echevarria had two daughters, Vanessa and Glendalys Vigoreaux. Glendalys committed suicide on July 15, 2008.

<doc id="172136" wikidata="Q23564" url="?curid=172136" title="Podgorica">
<text>Podgorica (, ; ) is the capital and largest city of Montenegro. The city is just north of Lake Skadar and close to coastal destinations on the Adriatic Sea. Historically, it was Podgorica&#x27;s position at the confluence of the Ribnica and Morača rivers and at the meeting-point of the fertile Zeta Plain and Bjelopavlići Valley that encouraged settlement. The surrounding landscape is predominantly mountainous terrain.

After World War II, Podgorica was first designated as the capital of Montenegro in 1946. At that time, it was renamed Titograd in honor of Josip Broz Tito, the leader of Yugoslavia. It served as the capital of the Socialist Republic of Montenegro within the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia until Montenegro&#x27;s declaration of independence in 2006, after which it was reaffirmed as the capital of an independent Montenegro. The city&#x27;s original name, Podgorica, was restored in 1992 following the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

The economy of Podgorica is based on a mix of industries, including manufacturing, trade, and services. The city has seen a rise in the IT sector, with numerous startups and tech companies emerging. Podgorica serves as a central hub for Montenegro&#x27;s transportation network, with an extensive road and rail system and the nearby Podgorica Airport. Tourism is also a growing sector, with the city being a gateway to Montenegro&#x27;s natural and cultural attractions.

Podgorica is home to the University of Montenegro, the largest and most significant educational institution in the country. The city&#x27;s cultural institutions include the Montenegrin National Theatre, the Natural History Museum of Montenegro, and several galleries and libraries. About one-third of the city&#x27;s area is composed of parks, gardens, and natural landscapes, including the nearby Gorica Hill.

Prominent landmarks in Podgorica include the Millennium Bridge, the Clock Tower, and the Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ. The city also features historical sites such as the ancient Roman settlement of Doclea and the old Ottoman town of Stara Varoš.

==Etymology==
Podgorica is written in Cyrillic as Подгорица, ; , ; &quot;Podgorica&quot; literally means &quot;under the hill&quot;. &quot;Gorica&quot; (), a diminutive of the word Gora (Cyrillic: Гора) which is another word for Mountain or Hill, means &quot;little/small hill&quot;, is the name of one of the cypress-covered hillocks that overlooks the city center. Some three kilometres () north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of Doclea, from which the Roman Emperor Diocletian&#x27;s mother hailed. In later centuries, Romans corrected the name to , guessing that an &quot;i&quot; had been lost in vulgar speech. is the later South Slavic version of the same word. At its foundation in 426 AD, the town was called . In the Middle Ages, it was known as Ribnica (, ). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was named Titograd (, ) in honour of Josip Broz Tito, the President of Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from 1953 to 1980. In 1992 the city changed its name to &quot;Podgorica&quot;, which it remains today.

==History==

===Early history===
Podgorica is at the crossroads of several historically important routes, near the rivers Zeta, Morača, Cijevna, Ribnica, Sitnica and Mareza in the valley of Lake Skadar and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late Stone Age.

In the Iron Age, the area between the Zeta and Bjelopavlići valleys was populated by two Illyrian tribes, the Labeates and the Docleatae. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000–10,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favorable climate, and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.

The name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the Kotor archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the Republic of Ragusa and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through Trebinje and Nikšić. As a busy crossroads, Podgorica was a vibrant regional center of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength, and strategic importance.

In 1448 Stefan Crnojević allied himself with the Republic of Venice, and after defeating the despot Đurađ Branković in 1452, he handed over Podgorica to the Venetian Republic, which already held the Shkodër region. However, Venetian rule of Podgorica did not last long, because Mehmed II soon conquered the fortified town of Medun in 1455, and two years later, most of Zeta.

===Ottoman Empire===

The Ottoman Empire captured Podgorica in 1474. Podgorica became a kaza of the Sanjak of Scutari (which was historically led by Albanian Pashas). In 1479, The Ottomans built a large fortress in Podgorica, and the existing settlement, with its highly developed merchant connections, became the main Ottoman defensive and attacking bastion in the region. At the beginning of 1474 the Ottoman sultan intended to rebuild Podgorica and Baleč and settle them with 5,000 Muslim families (most of them of Albanian or Slavic origin), in order to stop cooperation between the Principality of Zeta and Albania Veneta.

Podgorica fell again, but this time to the Ottomans in 1484, and the character of the town changed extensively. The Ottomans fortified the city, building towers, gates, and defensive ramparts that give Podgorica the appearance of an Ottoman military city.

Most of today&#x27;s Montenegro and Podgorica fell under the rule of the Albanian Bushati Family of Shkodra between 1760 and 1831, which ruled independently from the Imperial authority of the Ottoman Sultan.

In 1864, Podgorica became a &quot;kaza&quot; of the Scutari Vilayet called Böğürtlen (&quot;blackberry&quot;, also known as Burguriçe).

On 7 October 1874, in a violent reaction over the murder of a local named Juso Mučin Krnić, Ottoman forces killed at least 15 people in Podgorica. The massacre was widely reported outside of Montenegro and ultimately contributed to the buildup to the Montenegrin-Ottoman War.

The end of the Montenegrin-Ottoman War in 1878 resulted in the Congress of Berlin recognizing vast territories, including that of Podgorica, as part of the newly recognized Principality of Montenegro. At that time there were about 1,500 houses in Podgorica, with more than 8,000 people living there – of Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Muslim faiths flourishing together.

===The Petrović and Karađorđević monarchies===

After the Berlin Congress in 1878, Podgorica was annexed to the Principality of Montenegro, marking the end of four centuries of Ottoman rule, and the beginning of a new era for Podgorica and Montenegro. The first forms of capital concentration were seen in 1902 when roads were built to all neighboring towns, and tobacco became Podgorica&#x27;s first significant commercial product. In 1904, a savings bank named Zetska formed the first significant financial institution; this would soon grow into Podgorička Bank.

World War I marked the end of dynamic development for Podgorica, which by then was the largest city in the newly proclaimed Kingdom of Montenegro. On 10 August 1914, nine military personnel and 13 civilians were killed in Podgorica from an aerial bombardment by Austro-Hungarian Aviation Troops. The city was bombed three more times in 1915. Along with the rest of the Kingdom, Podgorica was occupied by Austria-Hungary from 1916 to 1918.

After the liberation by the Allies in 1918, the controversial Podgorica Assembly marked the end of Montenegrin statehood, as Montenegro was merged with the Kingdom of Serbia and incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The population of urban Podgorica during this interwar period was approximately 14,000.

During the interwar period (1918–1941), Podgorica had public bathrooms as most residents did not have their own. However, the &quot;Imperial&quot; hotel built in 1925 had two bathrooms, which was unprecedented at the time. It was one of at least six hotels built in the city during the interwar period.

===World War II===

After the Yugoslav coup d&#x27;état on 27 March 1941, demonstrations supporting the coup took place in Podgorica. As a result of the coup, Yugoslavia turned against its previous alliance with the Axis powers and was subsequently invaded. Podgorica was bombed over 80 times throughout the course of the war. The city was first bombed by the Luftwaffe on 6 April 1941. On 5 May 1944, Podgorica was bombed by the USAAF in an attack against Axis forces, although the bombardment that day killed approximately 400 civilians. The city was liberated on 19 December 1944. According to the &quot;Museum of Genocide Victims&quot;, a total of 1,691 people were killed in Podgorica over the course of the war.

===Socialist Yugoslavia===
On 12 July 1946, Josip Broz Tito made one of his early visits to Podgorica from the &quot;Radovče&quot; hotel, where he spoke to a crowd. It was the first of fifteen total visits made by Tito to the city after World War II.

On 25 July 1948, the vice president of the People&#x27;s Parliament of Montenegro, Andrija Mugoša, along with secretary Gavron Cemović, signed a law changing the name of Podgorica into &quot;Titovgrad&quot;. The law was &quot;retroactively&quot; activated such that the name change applied to any records starting from 13 July 1946, when it became the capital of Montenegro within the newly formed Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. However, in a contradiction, the &quot;Službeni list&quot; or legal code of Yugoslavia recorded the name &quot;Titograd&quot; without the letter &quot;v&quot;. Ultimately, &quot;Titograd&quot; was used over &quot;Titovgrad&quot;.

In addition to the new name, Titograd saw the establishment of new factories. The Radoje Dakić factory, built-in 1946 for the production of heavy machinery, became one of the largest employers in Titograd. In 1964, Radoje Dakić guaranteed hired workers an apartment in the city. In the late 1960s, the cities of Titograd, Zadar, and Mostar competed to be selected as the location of Yugoslavia&#x27;s expanding aluminum industry. In a highly politicized selection process, Titograd was ultimately chosen and the Kombinat was constructed in 1969. In 1974, the public Veljko Vlahović University was founded in Titograd. On 15 April 1979, the city suffered damage by a 6.9 magnitude earthquake.

Titograd was the site of massive protests during Yugoslavia&#x27;s anti-bureaucratic revolution. On 10 January 1989, over 10,000 people protested in the city. By the turn of the decade, Titograd was recognized as the city with the most greenery in Yugoslavia, along with Banja Luka.

===Contemporary history===
As Yugoslavia began to break up, Titograd was renamed to Podgorica after a referendum on 2 April 1992. On 25 May 1992, Podgorica was the site of a Serbian Radical Party rally of approximately 10,000 supporters, during which a Montenegrin Bosniak man named Adem Šabotić attempted to assassinate Vojislav Šešelj via hand bomb after his supporters chanted references to killing Muslims. Šešelj, his bodyguards, and a few bystanders were injured after the bomb detonated but no one was killed.

Otherwise, the Yugoslav wars largely bypassed Podgorica, but the entire country was greatly affected with severe economic stagnation and hyperinflation lasting throughout the 1990s due to international sanctions. In 1999, Podgorica was subject to airstrikes during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

On 13 July 2005, the newly constructed Millennium Bridge opened for traffic. Following the results of the independence referendum in May 2006, Podgorica saw significant development as the capital of an independent state, including the reconstruction and renaming of the former Ivan Milutinović Square to Independence Square.

On 13 October 2008, at least 10,000 people protested against Kosovo&#x27;s declaration of independence. On 19 December 2008, the Moscow Bridge opened for pedestrians.

On 7 August 2013, the 60-year old Hotel &quot;Crna Gora&quot; was demolished to make way for the new Hilton in its place, which opened in 2016. Construction of the Cathedral of Christ&#x27;s Resurrection finished after 20 years on 7 October 2013.

In October 2015, protests took place in Podgorica ahead of Montenegro&#x27;s accession into NATO. After a demonstration of at least 5,000 to 8,000 people, the police used tear gas to disperse demonstrators from the parliament. Protests in the city continued through the 2016 Montenegrin parliamentary election. On 22 February 2018, a Yugoslav Army veteran killed himself at the US embassy in Podgorica.

==Administration==
The city administration consists of a mayor, city assembly, and a number of secretariats and administrative bodies which together act as a city local government. The city assembly has 61 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for a five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during the term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of Golubovci since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for Golubovci. In 2018, Tuzi became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.

On local elections held on 25 May 2014, the Democratic Party of Socialists won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. Democratic Front won 17 seats, SNP won 8 seats, while coalition made of Positive Montenegro and SDP won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna and made an arrangement on forming a majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is a longtime partner of DPS at the national level, it has been in opposition to Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010–2014 period.
Since October 2014, the position of the mayor is held by DPS official, Slavoljub Stijepović, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, Miomir Mugoša. Since October 2018, the position of the Mayor is held by DPS Vice president dr Ivan Vuković, replacing Slavoljub Stijepović. On 13 April 2023, Olivera Injac from PES was sworn in as mayor, thus becoming the first non-DPS mayor since 1998.

===City Assembly===
===Local subdivisions===
The entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 66 &quot;local communities&quot; (мјесне заједнице, &quot;mjesne zajednice&quot;), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.

==Geography==
Podgorica is located in central Montenegro. The area is crossed with rivers and the city itself is only north of Lake Skadar. The Morača and Ribnica rivers flow through the city, while the Zeta, Cijevna, Sitnica and Mareza flow nearby. &quot;Morača&quot; is the largest river in the city, being wide near downtown, and having carved a deep canyon for the length of its course through the city. Except for the Morača and Zeta, other rivers have an appearance of small creeks. The richness in bodies of water is a major feature of the city.

In contrast to most of Montenegro, Podgorica lies in a mainly flat area at the northern end of the Zeta plain, at an elevation of . The only exceptions are hills which overlook the city. The most significant is high Gorica Hill (), city&#x27;s namesake, which rises above the city centre. The other hills include &quot;Malo brdo&quot; (&quot;little hill&quot;, ), &quot;Velje brdo&quot; (&quot;big hill&quot;, ), Ljubović () and &quot;Dajbapska gora&quot; ().
Podgorica city proper has an area of , while actual urbanized area is much smaller.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Podgorica is transitional between a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) and a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;), since the driest summer month gets slightly less than of precipitation, with summer highs around and winter highs around . Although the city is only some north of the Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean, Mount Rumija acts as a natural barrier, separating Skadar Lake basin and Podgorica area from the sea, thus limiting temperate maritime influence on the local climate.

The mean annual rainfall is , making Podgorica by far the wettest capital in Europe, Ljubljana being second with . The temperature exceeds on about 135 days each year. The number of rainy days is about 120, and those with a strong wind around 60. An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a wind chill effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. 

The all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when of snowfall were measured. Before that, the biggest snowfall in Podgorica was in 1954, when of snowfall was recorded. Maximum temperature was recorded on 24 August 2007, at , while all time minimum was , on 4 February 1956.

==Economy==
Podgorica is not only the administrative center of Montenegro but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro&#x27;s industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. 

Before World War I, most of Podgorica&#x27;s economy was in trade and small-scale manufacturing, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the Ottoman Empire. After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro&#x27;s capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, textiles, engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica&#x27;s GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.

In the early 1990s, the dissolution of Yugoslavia, Yugoslav wars, and the UN-imposed sanctions left Podgorica&#x27;s industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical transition pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. However, some of the industries, including Plantaže, managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.

As Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from the increased concentration of government and service sectors. In addition to almost the entire country&#x27;s government, Podgorica is home to the Montenegro Stock Exchange and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, Montenegrin flag carrier airline, and other significant institutions and companies.

The large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the late 2000s recession, which hit Montenegro hard. Although in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro&#x27;s citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country&#x27;s employed. Out of the entire mass of paid net salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in December 2021 was €537 in Podgorica municipality.

===Tourism===
Further cultural and historic monuments in and around Podgorica are Sahat kula (Clock tower) Adži-paše Osmanagića, the ruins of the Ribnica fortress, remnants of the city of Doclea, Stara Varoš, and Vezirov most (Vizier&#x27;s bridge). Podgorica has excellent transit connections with other centres.

At nine kilometres from the city is the International Airport, with railway and bus stations close to one another.

===Media===
Podgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned public television broadcaster RTCG. It has also its local TV and radio station Gradska. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include TV Vijesti, Prva TV, Nova M and Adria TV.
All Montenegro&#x27;s daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper &quot;Pobjeda&quot;, &quot;Vijesti&quot;, &quot;Dnevne Novine&quot; and &quot;Dan&quot;) are published in Podgorica.

==Transport==

===Public transport===

Public transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines. The city-owned &quot;AD Gradski saobraćaj&quot; public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers. As of 2023 Public transport in Podgorica is done only by buses, 12 city and 16 suburban lines.

Public transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation. Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and GPS-tracked vehicles.

===Roads===
Podgorica&#x27;s location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and Serbia) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, Bar-Boljare motorway and Nudo–Božaj motorway, will pass near Podgorica. The first phase of motorway A-1 (Bar-Boljare) was opened on July 13, 2022. The Sozina tunnel (4.2 km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to Bar (Montenegro&#x27;s main seaport) to under 30 minutes. A new road bypass had been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city center. A south-western bypass had also been constructed with the same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic of its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner-city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the Morača River also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.

The main transit connections of Podgorica are:
* north (E65, E80), towards Belgrade and on to Central Europe
* west (E762), towards Nikšić, Bosnia and on to Western Europe
* south (E65, E80) towards the Adriatic coast
* east (E762), towards Albania
===Rail===

Podgorica is a hub of the X-shaped Montenegrin rail network. The Belgrade–Bar line converges with the line to Nikšić and line to Shkodër at the Podgorica Rail Station. The station itself is located to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica&#x27;s main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade–Bar. The link to Nikšić was recently under reconstruction (electrification); afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to Shkodër is used as freight-only.

===Air===

Podgorica Airport is located in Zeta Plain, south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro&#x27;s main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (Аеродром Голубовци / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of Golubovci. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for Air Montenegro and Di Air.

==Education==

Most of Montenegro&#x27;s higher education establishments are in Podgorica including the University of Montenegro, the country&#x27;s most significant university. The university has the following faculties:

There are a number of private institutions for higher education including the Mediterranean University which was founded in 2006 as the first private university in Montenegro and the University of Donja Gorica. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one gymnasium. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is Gymnasium &quot;Slobodan Škerović&quot; which first opened in 1907. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The &quot;Radosav Ljumović National Library&quot; is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.

==Culture==
Podgorica is home to many Montenegrin cultural institutions and events. It hosts the Montenegrin National Theatre and a number of museums and galleries. The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (&quot;Gradsko pozorište&quot;), which includes the Children&#x27;s Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital Cetinje, there are several noteworthy museums:
* The Podgorica City Museum (&quot;Muzej grada Podgorice&quot;) preserves Podgorica&#x27;s rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical, and cultural-historical. It houses artifacts that date back to the Roman and Illyrian eras. 
* The Archaeological Research Centre (&quot;Centar za arheološka istraživanja&quot;) was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.
* The Marko Miljanov Museum (&quot;Muzej Marka Miljanova&quot;) in Medun shows life in 19th century Montenegro.
* The Natural History Museum (&quot;Prirodnjački muzej&quot;) displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. 
There is a notable art gallery in the &quot;Dvorac&quot; &quot;Petrovića&quot; (Petrović Castle) complex in Podgorica&#x27;s largest public park. The palace hosted the Gallery of the Non-Aligned Countries &quot;Josip Broz Tito&quot; between 1984 and 1995. King Nicholas&#x27;s castle, &quot;Perjanički Dom&quot; (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (&quot;Centar savremenih umjetnosti&quot;) and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (&quot;Kino Kultura&quot;), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a Ster-Kinekor (later acquired by Cineplexx) 6-screen multiplex cinema opened at BIG Podgorica shopping mall.

A significant cultural institution of over fifty years&#x27; standing is the Budo Tomović Cultural-Informational Centre (&quot;KIC Budo Tomović&quot;). It is a public institution that organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (&quot;Podgoričko Kulturno Ljeto&quot;), FIAT – International Alternative Theatre Festival (&quot;Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra&quot;), DEUS – December Arts Scene (&quot;Decembarska Umjetnička Scena&quot;).

==Sport==
The most popular sports by far are football and basketball. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of KK Budućnost, both in Regional and European competitions.

Football in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with Budućnost. World-famous players Predrag Mijatović and Dejan Savićević were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club FK Zeta from the Podgorica suburb of Golubovci has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with Sutjeska from Nikšić, usually compete with each other for leading position in the First League of Montenegro.
Other clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. OFK Titograd &amp; Kom. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is FK Ribnica from Konik, FK Zabjelo from Zabjelo and FK Podgorica from &quot;Donja Gorica&quot;.

The volleyball team OK Budućnost and the women&#x27;s handball team ŽRK Budućnost T-Mobile have had significant success in European competition. Budućnost Podgorica is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means &quot;Future&quot;.

Chess is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like Slavko Dedić, are born in Podgorica.

Sporting events like the annual Podgorica Marathon, Coinis no limits Triathlon, and the &quot;Morača River&quot; jumps attract international competitors.
Podgorica was the host of 2009 FINA Men&#x27;s Water Polo World League.

===Venues===

Podgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:
* Podgorica City Stadium has a capacity of 11,264 and is the home of FK Budućnost Podgorica and the Montenegro national football team. It is the only venue in Montenegro that complies with FIFA standards for international football matches.

Almost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.
Other notable venues are the Stadion malih sportova under Gorica hill and the sport shooting range under Ljubović hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably indoor soccer fields.
==Cityscape==

Podgorica&#x27;s mixture of architectural styles reflects the turbulent history of the city and country: as one régime replaced another, the corresponding style was introduced.

As part of the Ottoman Empire until 1878, Podgorica has some examples of Ottoman architecture. The oldest parts of the city, &quot;Stara Varoš&quot; (&quot;Old town&quot;) and &quot;Drač&quot; is typical of this, with two mosques, a Turkish Clock Tower and narrow, winding streets.

When the city was incorporated to Montenegro, the urban core shifted to the other bank of the Ribnica River, where the town developed in a more European style: wider streets with an orthogonal layout. This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as the city center and is called &quot;Nova Varoš&quot; (&quot;New town&quot;).

During World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being bombed over 80 times. After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of Eastern bloc countries. All that part of the city on the right bank of the Morača River was built this way.

The main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of the city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today&#x27;s Podgorica and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. 

A major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in the city&#x27;s public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares and some monuments. New landmarks include the &quot;Hristovog Vaskrsenja&quot; orthodox temple and the Millennium Bridge, the main feature of the Podgorica skyline.

<doc id="172138" wikidata="Q335274" url="?curid=172138" title="John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville">
<text>John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville, 7th Seigneur of Sark (; 22 April 16902 January 1763), commonly known by his earlier title Lord Carteret, was a British statesman and Lord President of the Council from 1751 to 1763 and worked closely with the Prime Minister of the country, Spencer Compton, Earl of Wilmington, to manage the various factions of the Government. He was Seigneur of Sark from 1715 to 1720, when he sold the fief. He held (in absentia) the office of Bailiff of Jersey from 1715 to 1763.

==Origins==
He was the son and heir of George Carteret, 1st Baron Carteret (1667–1695) by his wife, Lady Grace Granville (c. 1677–1744), &quot;suo jure&quot; 1st Countess Granville, 3rd daughter of John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath (1628–1701) of Stowe House in the parish of Kilkhampton in Cornwall. The progeny of the marriage, Barons Carteret, Earls Granville, and Marquesses of Bath (Thynne), were co-heirs to her childless nephew William Granville, 3rd Earl of Bath (1692–1711). The family of Carteret was settled in the Channel Islands and was of Norman descent.

==Early life==
John Carteret was educated at Westminster School, and at Christ Church, Oxford. Jonathan Swift said that &quot;with a singularity scarce to be justified he carried away more Greek, Latin and philosophy than properly became a person of his rank&quot;. Throughout his life, Carteret showed not only a keen love of the classics, but also a taste for and knowledge of modern languages and literature. He was almost the only English nobleman of his time who spoke German, which allowed him to talk with and gain the trust of King George I, who spoke little English. Walter Harte, the author of the &quot;Life of Gustavus Adolphus&quot;, acknowledged the aid that Carteret had given him.

On 17 October 1710 at Longleat House, Carteret married Frances Worsley, daughter of Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet and Frances Thynne, Lady Worsley. She was the granddaughter of the 1st Viscount Weymouth. One of their daughters, Georgiana Caroline Carteret Spencer, became the grandmother of Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire.

Upon reaching his majority of 21, Lord Carteret took his seat in the House of Lords on 25 May 1711. Although his family, on both sides, had been devoted to the Jacobite cause, Carteret was a steady adherent of the Hanoverian dynasty that supplanted it. He was a friend of the Whig leaders Stanhope and Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland, and supported the passing of the Septennial Act.

==Diplomat==
Carteret&#x27;s interests were in foreign, not domestic, policy. His serious work in public life began with his appointment, early in 1719, as Ambassador to Sweden. During this and the following year he was employed in saving Sweden from the attacks of Peter the Great, and in arranging the pacification of the north. His efforts were finally successful.

During this period of diplomatic work he acquired an exceptional knowledge of the affairs of Europe, and in particular of Germany, and displayed great tact and temper in dealing with the Swedish Riksdag, Ulrike Eleonora of Sweden, Frederick IV of Denmark and Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia. However, he was not qualified to hold his own in the intrigues of Court and Parliament in London. Appointed as Secretary of State for the Southern Department on his return home, he soon came into conflict with the intrigues of Townshend and Sir Robert Walpole.

==Rivalry with Walpole==
To Walpole, who looked upon every able colleague or subordinate as an enemy to be removed, Carteret was exceptionally odious. His capacity to speak German with the King would alone have made Sir Robert detest him. When, therefore, the violent agitation in Ireland against Wood&#x27;s halfpence made it necessary to replace the Duke of Grafton as Lord Lieutenant, Carteret was sent to Dublin, where he landed on 23 October 1724. Trinity College, Dublin, awarded him an Honorary LLD in 1725.

In the first months of his tenure of office, he had to deal with the furious opposition to Wood&#x27;s halfpence and to counteract the effect of Swift&#x27;s &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;. Carteret had a strong personal liking for Swift, who was also a friend of his wife&#x27;s family. It is highly doubtful that Carteret could have reconciled his duty to the crown with his private friendships if the government had persisted in endeavouring to force the detested coinage on the Irish people. Wood&#x27;s patent was, however, withdrawn, and Ireland settled down. Carteret was a profuse and popular Lord Lieutenant, who pleased both the British interest and the native Irish. He was at all times addicted to lavish hospitality and, according to the testimony of contemporaries, was &quot;too fond of burgundy&quot;. He remained in post until 1730.

==Americas==
Carteret had inherited a one-eighth share in the Province of Carolina through his great-grandfather Sir George Carteret. In 1727 and 1728 John learned that the owners of the remaining shares were planning to sell them back to the crown. Carteret declined to join them. In 1729, the others surrendered their claims, but in 1730, Carteret, to keep ownership of his stake, agreed to give up any participation in government.

Carteret&#x27;s share was later defined as a 60-mile wide strip of land in North Carolina adjoining the Virginia boundary, and became known as the Granville District. The lands of the Granville District remained a possession of the Carteret family until the death of Carteret&#x27;s son Robert in 1776. After the American War of Independence, Robert&#x27;s heirs were compensated in part by the Crown for the loss of the lands.

==Queen Caroline==
When Carteret returned to London in 1730, Walpole was firmly in charge of the House of Commons and as the trusted Minister of King George II. Walpole also had the full confidence of Queen Caroline, whom he prejudiced against Carteret. Until the fall of Walpole in 1742, Carteret could take no share in public affairs except as a leader of opposition in the House of Lords. His brilliant parts were somewhat obscured by his rather erratic conduct and a certain contempt, partly aristocratic and partly intellectual, for commonplace men and ways. He endeavoured to please Queen Caroline, who loved literature, and he has the credit of having paid the expenses of the first handsome edition of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; to please her. He also involved himself in the establishment of the Foundling Hospital, a charity championed by the Queen, for which he became a founding governor. However, he reluctantly and most unwisely allowed himself to be entangled in the scandalous family quarrel between Frederick, Prince of Wales, and his parents. Queen Caroline was provoked into classing Carteret and Bolingbroke as &quot;the two most worthless men of parts in the country&quot;.

==Secretary of State==

Carteret took the popular side in the outcry against Walpole for not declaring war on Spain. When the War of the Austrian Succession approached, his sympathies were entirely with Maria Theresa of Austria, mainly on the ground that the fall of the house of Austria would dangerously increase the power of France even if she gained no accession of territory. Those views made him welcome to George II, who gladly accepted him as Secretary of State in 1742. In 1743, he accompanied the King to Germany and was present at the Battle of Dettingen on 27 June 1743. Carteret held the secretary-ship until November 1744.

Carteret succeeded in promoting an agreement between Maria Theresa and Frederick II of Prussia. He understood the relations of the European states and the interests of Great Britain among them, but the defects that had rendered him unable to baffle the intrigues of Walpole made him equally unable to contend with the Pelhams (Henry Pelham and his elder brother Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, successive Prime Ministers). Carteret&#x27;s support of the King&#x27;s policy was denounced as subservience to Hanover. William Pitt called him &quot;an execrable, a &quot;sole minister&quot;, who had renounced the British nation&quot;. A few years later, Pitt adopted an identical policy and professed that whatever he knew he had learnt from Carteret.

==Earl Granville==
On 18 October 1744 Carteret became 2nd Earl Granville on the death of his mother. His first wife, Lady Frances Worsley, died on 20 June 1743 at Hanover, and in April 1744, he married Lady Sophia Fermor, a daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret and a fashionable beauty and &quot;reigning toast&quot; of London society who was younger than his daughters. Granville&#x27;s ostentatious performance of the part of lover was ridiculed by Horace Walpole as &quot;The nuptials of our great Quixote and the fair Sophia&quot; and &quot;My lord stayed with her there till four in the morning. They are all fondnesswalk together, and stop every five steps to kiss&quot;.

The Countess Granville died on 7 October 1745, leaving one daughter, Sophia Carteret, who married William Petty, 2nd Earl of Shelburne, later 1st Marquess of Lansdowne. Granville&#x27;s second marriage may have done something to increase his reputation for eccentricity. In February 1746, he allowed himself to be entrapped by the intrigues of the Pelhams into accepting the secretaryship but resigned within forty-eight hours. In June 1751, he became president of the council and was still liked and trusted by the King, but his share in government did not go beyond giving advice and endeavouring to forward ministerial arrangements. In 1756, he was asked by Newcastle to become Prime Minister as the alternative to Pitt, but he perfectly understood why the offer was made and so he declined and supported Pitt. When, in October 1761, Pitt, who had information of the signing of the &quot;Family Compact&quot;, wished to declare war on Spain and declared his intention to resign unless his advice was accepted, Granville replied that &quot;the opinion of the majority (of the Cabinet) must decide&quot;. He spoke in complimentary terms of Pitt but resisted his claim to be considered as a &quot;sole minister&quot; or Prime Minister.

Whether he used the words that were attributed to him in the &quot;Annual Register&quot; for 1761 is more than doubtful, but the minutes of Council show that they express his meaning.

==Marriages and issue==
Carteret married twice, firstly to Frances Worsley (1694–1743), daughter of Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet, by whom he had three sons and five daughters:
* Lady Grace Carteret (8 July 1713 – 23 July 1755), who married Lionel Tollemache, 4th Earl of Dysart, and had issue.
*Hon. Louisa Carteret (1714–1736), married Thomas Thynne, 2nd Viscount Weymouth of Longleat in Wiltshire, and was the ancestress of the Marquesses of Bath (created 1789) and Barons Carteret (of the second creation 1784)
*Lady Georgiana Caroline Carteret (1715–1780), who married firstly John Spencer MP, and was the mother of John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer; she married secondly William Clavering-Cowper, 2nd Earl Cowper
*Hon. George Carteret (14 February 1716 – June 1721), died young
*Hon. Frances, died in infancy
*Lady Frances Carteret (6 April 1718 – 25 December 1788), married in 1748 John Hay, 4th Marquess of Tweeddale
*Hon. John Carteret (9 October 1719 – 1735), died young
*Robert Carteret, 3rd Earl Granville (1721–1776), eldest surviving son and heir

Secondly, in 1744, he married Lady Sophia Fermor (29 May 1721 – 7 October 1745), daughter of Thomas Fermor, 1st Earl of Pomfret. She died the following year of a fever, several months following the birth of their only daughter:
*Lady Sophia Carteret (26 August 1745 – 5 January 1771), who married William Petty, 1st Marquess of Lansdowne, and had issue.

==Death and burial==
He remained in office as President of the Privy Council until his death on 2 January 1763. His last act was to listen on his deathbed to the reading of the preliminaries of the Treaty of Paris by the Under-Secretary to the Secretary of State, Robert Wood, author of an essay on &quot;The Original Genius and Writings of Homer&quot;, who would have postponed the business, but Granville said that it &quot;could not prolong his life to neglect his duty&quot; and quoted in ancient Greek the speech of Sarpedon from the &quot;Iliad&quot; xii. 322–328, repeating the last word &quot;ἴομεν&quot; (&quot;iomen&quot;) (the first word of verse 328) meaning &quot;let us go forward&quot;. Wood recalled the event as follows:

&quot;However, in the course of that active period, the duties of my situation engaged me in an occasional attendance upon a nobleman, who, while he presided at his Majesty&#x27;s councils, reserved some moments for literary amusement. His Lordship was very partial to this subject; and I seldom had the honour of receiving his commands on business, that he did not lead the conversation to Greece and Homer. Being directed to wait upon his Lordship, a few days before he died, with the preliminary articles of the Treaty of Paris, I found him so languid, that I proposed postponing my business for another time: but he insisted that I should stay, saying, it could not prolong his life, to neglect his duty; and repeating the following passage, out of Sarpedon&#x27;s speech, he dwelled with particular emphasis on the third line, which recalled to his mind the distinguishing part, he had taken in public affairs. His Lordship repeated the last word several times with a calm and determinate resignation: and after a serious pause of some minutes, he desired to hear the Treaty read; to which he listened with great attention: and recovered spirits enough to declare the approbation of a dying Statesman (I use his own words) on the most glorious War, and most honourable Peace, this nation ever saw.&quot;
He died in his house in Arlington Street, London, on 2 January 1763. His remains were interred at Westminster Abbey.

==Succession==
The title of Earl Granville descended to his son Robert, who died without issue in 1776, when the earldom of this creation became extinct.

== Legacy ==
Two North Carolina counties were named for Lord Carteret, Carteret County (established 1722) and Granville County (1746). During the 17th and 18th centuries, the area which is now South Carolina used the names Carteret and Granville for a few of its counties.

Namesakes of Granville Street in Vancouver, British Columbia; Granville, Massachusetts; Granville, New York; Granville Centre, Nova Scotia, and Granville Ferry. Translator George Sale dedicated his Alcoran of Mohammed to Granville.

John Carteret is depicted in the 2011 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides&quot; by Anton Lesser.

<text>The compound 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile (also called &quot;o&quot;-chlorobenzylidene malononitrile; chemical formula: C10H5ClN2), a cyanocarbon, is the defining component of the lachrymatory agent commonly referred to as CS gas, a tear gas which is used as a riot control agent, and is banned for use in warfare due to the 1925 Geneva Protocol.

Exposure causes a burning sensation and tearing of the eyes to the extent that the subject cannot keep their eyes open, and a burning irritation of the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat, resulting in profuse coughing, nasal mucus discharge, disorientation, and difficulty breathing, partially incapacitating the subject. CS gas is an aerosol of a volatile solvent (a substance that dissolves other active substances and that easily evaporates) and 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile, which is a solid compound at room temperature. CS gas is generally accepted as being non-lethal.

==History==
CS gas was first synthesized by two Americans, Ben Corson and Roger Stoughton, at Middlebury College in Vermont in 1928, and the chemical&#x27;s name is derived from the first letters of the scientists&#x27; surnames.

CS was developed and tested secretly at Porton Down in Wiltshire, UK, in the 1950s and &#x27;60s. CS was used first on animals, and subsequently on British Army servicemen volunteers. CS has less effect on animals because they have different tear ducts and, in the case of non-human mammals, their fur inhibits the free entry of the gas.

As recently as 2002, the U.S. State Department Bureau of International Security and Nonproliferation of Colin Powell made a firm distinction between &quot;riot-control agents&quot; such as CS gas, and &quot;lethal chemical weapons.&quot; The Bureau cited support for this position from the U.K. and Japan.

The use of CS in warfare has been prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The OPCW (the governing body of the convention) has observed its use in the Russo-Ukrainian War in 2024.

== Production ==
CS is synthesized by the reaction of 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and malononitrile via the Knoevenagel condensation:

::ClC6H4CHO + H2C(CN)2 → ClC6H4CHC(CN)2 + H2O

The reaction is catalysed with a weak base like piperidine or pyridine. The production method has not changed since the substance was discovered by Corson and Stoughton. Other bases, solvent free methods and microwave promotion have been suggested to improve the production of the substance.

The physiological properties had been discovered already by the chemists first synthesising the compound in 1928:
&quot;Physiological Properties. Certain of these dinitriles have the effect of sneeze and tear gases. They are harmless when wet but to handle the dry powder is disastrous.&quot;

=== Use as an aerosol ===

As 2-chlorobenzalmalononitrile is a solid at room temperature, not a gas, a variety of techniques have been used to make this solid usable as an aerosol:

* Melted and sprayed in the molten form.
* Dissolved in organic solvent.
* CS2 dry powder (CS2 is a siliconized, micro-pulverized form of CS).
* CS from thermal grenades by generation of hot gases.

In the Waco Siege in the United States, CS was dissolved in the organic solvent dichloromethane (also known as methylene chloride). The solution was dispersed as an aerosol via explosive force and when the highly volatile dichloromethane evaporated, CS crystals precipitated and formed a fine dispersion in the air.

== Effects ==

Many types of tear gas and other riot control agents have been produced with effects ranging from mild tearing of the eyes to immediate vomiting and prostration. CN and CS are the most widely used and known, but around 15 different types of tear gas have been developed worldwide, e.g. adamsite or bromoacetone, CNB, and CNC. CS has become the most popular due to its strong effect. The effect of CS on a person will depend on whether it is packaged as a solution or used as an aerosol. The size of solution droplets and the size of the CS particulates after evaporation are factors determining its effect on the human body.

The chemical reacts with moisture on the skin and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses, it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Most of the immediate effects wear off within a few hours (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although respiratory, gastrointestinal, and oral symptoms may persist for months. Excessive exposure can cause chemical burns resulting in permanent scarring.

Adults exposed to tear gas during the 2020 protests in Portland, Oregon, US also reported menstrual changes (899; 54.5% of 1650 female respondents). Exposure to tear gas is associated with avoidable healthcare utilization.

=== Secondary effects ===
People or objects contaminated with CS gas can cause secondary exposure to others, including healthcare professionals and police. In addition, repeated exposure may cause sensitisation.

== Toxicity ==

TRPA1 (Transient Receptor Potential-Ankyrin 1) ion channel expressed on nociceptors (especially trigeminal) has been implicated as the site of action for CS gas in rodent models.

Although described as a non-lethal weapon for crowd control, studies have raised doubts about this classification. CS can cause severe pulmonary damage and can also significantly damage the heart and liver.

On 28 September 2000, Prof. Dr. Uwe Heinrich released a study commissioned by John C. Danforth, of the United States Office of Special Counsel, to investigate the use of CS by the FBI at the Branch Davidians&#x27; Mount Carmel compound. He said no human deaths had been reported, but concluded that the lethality of CS used would have been determined mainly by two factors: whether gas masks were used and whether the occupants were trapped in a room. He suggests that if no gas masks were used and the occupants were trapped, then, &quot;there is a distinct possibility that this kind of CS exposure can significantly contribute to or even cause lethal effects&quot;.

CS gas can have a clastogenic effect (abnormal chromosome change) on mammalian cells, but no studies have linked it to miscarriages or stillbirths. In Egypt, CS gas was reported to be the cause of death of several protesters in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near Tahrir square during the November 2011 protests. The solvent in which CS is dissolved, methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK), is classified as harmful by inhalation; irritating to the eyes and respiratory system; and repeated exposure may cause skin dryness or cracking.

<text>Xenusion auerswaldae is an early lobopodian known from three specimens found in glacial erratics on the Baltic coast of Germany. Another specimen, discovered shortly after the holotype, was briefly observed but soon went missing. Except for this lost specimen, the fossils probably originated in the Kalmarsund Sandstone of Southern Sweden, which was deposited in the Lower Cambrian (Upper Tommotian–Lower Atdabanian; Stages 2→3). It is the oldest currently known lobopodian with soft body fossils.

The specimens are not especially well preserved. The older specimen is 10 cm or so in length with a narrow, weakly segmented body. Assuming it was the posterior section, the specimen was estimated to be part of an animal about 20 cm in length. A depression runs up the bottom on all but the rearmost segments. There is a slightly bulbous termination, and each segment before that seems to have a single pair of tapering annulated legs similar to the modern onychophoran, but without specialized feet and claws. More than 10 body segments were present. There is presumably a spine on each body bump and faint transverse parallel striations on the annulations on the legs. The legs of what is possibly the foremost segments are either absent or not preserved. The head is believed to be missing or poorly preserved. Based on a new specimen that shows the anterior section, it possibly had a long narrow proboscis, but this also suggested to be a preservational artefact.

&quot;Xenusion&quot; has been reinterpreted as an Ediacaran frond animal by Tarlo, and a drawing of that interpretation has been presented by McMenamin. In a photograph presented in &quot;The Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology&quot; Volume O, the organism&#x27;s appearance seems to support the original interpretation more. Further studies of Xenusiid close the possibility of a Rangeomorphy affinity.

<doc id="172161" wikidata="Q146604" url="?curid=172161" title="Blackcurrant">
<text>The blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum), also known as black currant or cassis, is a deciduous shrub in the family Grossulariaceae grown for its edible berries. It is native to temperate parts of central and northern Europe and northern Asia, where it prefers damp fertile soils. It is widely cultivated both commercially and domestically.

It is winter hardy, but cold weather at flowering time during the spring may reduce the size of the crop. Bunches of small, glossy black fruit develop along the stems in the summer and can be harvested by hand or by machine.

The raw fruit is particularly rich in vitamin C and polyphenols. Blackcurrants can be eaten raw but are usually cooked in sweet or savoury dishes. They are used to make jams, preserves, and syrups and are grown commercially for the juice market. The fruit is also used to make alcoholic beverages and dyes.

==Description==

&quot;Ribes nigrum&quot; is a medium-sized shrub, growing to . The leaves are alternate, simple, broad and long with five palmate lobes and a serrated margin. All parts of the plant are strongly aromatic. The flowers are produced in racemes known as &quot;strigs&quot; up to long containing 10–20 flowers, each about in diameter. Each flower has a hairy calyx with yellow glands, the five lobes of which are longer than the inconspicuous petals. There are five stamens surrounding the stigma and style and two fused carpels. The flowers open in succession from the base of the string and are mostly insect pollinated, but some pollen is distributed by the wind. A pollen grain landing on a stigma will germinate and send a slender pollen tube down the style to the ovule. In warm weather, this takes about 48 hours, but in cold weather, it may take a week, and by that time, the ovule may have passed the stage where it is receptive. If fewer than about 35 ovules are fertilised, the fruit may not be able to develop and will fall prematurely. Frost can damage both unopened and open flowers when the temperature falls below . The flowers at the base of the strig are more protected by the foliage and are less likely to be damaged.

In midsummer the strigs of green fruit ripen to edible berries, very dark purple in colour, almost black, with glossy skins and calyxes at the apex (the calyxes being persistent), each containing many seeds. An established bush can produce about of fruit each year.

Plants from Northern Asia are sometimes distinguished as a separate variety, , of which &quot;R. cyathiforme&quot; is considered a synonym.

=== Phytochemicals ===
Polyphenol phytochemicals present in the fruit, seeds, and leaves are being investigated for their potential biological activities. Major anthocyanins in blackcurrant pomace delphinidin-3-&quot;O&quot;-glucoside, delphinidin-3-&quot;O&quot;-rutinoside, cyanidin-3-&quot;O&quot;-glucoside, and cyanidin-3-&quot;O&quot;-rutinoside, which are retained in the juice concentrate are among other polyphenols.

==Distribution and habitat==
The blackcurrant is native to northern Europe and Asia.

==Cultivation==

Cultivation in Europe is thought to have started around the last decades of the 17th century.

===Site selection and planting===

Blackcurrants can grow well on sandy or heavy loams, or forest soils, as long as their nutrient requirements are met. They prefer damp, fertile but not waterlogged ground and are intolerant of drought. Although the bushes are winter hardy, frosts during the flowering period may adversely affect the yield and cold winds may restrict the number of flying insects visiting and pollinating the flowers. A soil pH of about 6 is ideal for blackcurrants and the ground can be limed if the soil is too acidic. Planting is usually done in the autumn or winter to allow the plants to become established before growth starts in the spring, but container-grown stock can be planted at any time of year.

Two-year-old bushes are usually planted but strong one-year-old stock can also be used. Planting certified stock avoids the risk of introducing viruses. On a garden scale the plants can be set at intervals of or they can be set in rows with planting intervals of and row separations of or more. In the UK, young bushes are generally planted deeper than their initial growing level to encourage new stems to grow from the base.

===Manures and fertilizers===
The blackcurrant requires a number of essential nutrients to thrive; nitrogen provides strong plant growth and stimulates the production of flower sprigs; phosphorus aids growth, the setting of fruit and crop yield; potassium promotes growth of individual shoots and increases the weight of individual fruits; magnesium is a constituent of chlorophyll and helps increase yields through interaction with potassium; calcium is required for cell division and enlargement and is particularly important for young plants and buds.

An annual spring mulch of well rotted manure is ideal and poultry manure can also be used but needs prior composting with straw or other waste vegetable material. Spent mushroom compost can be used but care should be taken as it often contains lime and blackcurrants prefer slightly acidic soils. The blackcurrant is a gross feeder and benefits from additional nitrogen, and phosphatic and potash fertilisers should also be applied annually. A balanced artificial fertilizer can be used and a 10-10-10 granular product can be spread around the bushes at the rate of per plant. Weed growth can be suppressed with an organic mulch such as sawdust, bark, mushroom compost or straw, heavy plastic topped with an organic mulch cover or landscape fabric.

===Pruning===

Blackcurrant fruit is borne primarily on one-year-old shoots. Newly planted bushes should be pruned severely, cutting all shoots back to two buds above ground level. This gives the plant a chance to get properly established before needing to put its energy into producing fruit. The general rule when pruning is to remove all weak shoots and those growing out sideways which may get weighed down when fruiting. The remaining branches should be thinned to remove old unproductive wood and to encourage new shoots. An established bush should not be allowed to become overcrowded and should have about one third of its main branches or stems removed each year. When harvesting by machine, plants with an upright growth habit are encouraged.

===Harvesting===
On a garden scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most harvesting is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling a row of bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some fruit is still picked by hand for use in the fresh fruit market.

===Diseases and pests===

&quot;Ribes&quot; plants are susceptible to several diseases and a number of insect pests. However, new varieties have been or are being developed to overcome some of these problems.

Reversion is a serious disease transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite (&quot;Cecidophyopsis ribis&quot;). It causes a decline in yield and is quite widespread in Europe but is rarely encountered on other continents. Symptoms include a modification of leaf shape in summer and swollen buds (&quot;big bud&quot;) in winter, each housing thousands of microscopic mites. As pest control has limited effectiveness, severely infected bushes should be destroyed. All new plants purchased should be certified as virus-free.

White pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;) needs two alternate hosts to complete its life cycle. One host is plants in the genus &quot;Ribes&quot;. On the blackcurrant, it causes the leaves to become pale and later develop tiny orange pustules and sometimes a yellow filamentous coating on some leaves. The fruit crop is little affected but the leaves fall early and growth is slowed the following year. The other host is any of the white pines, in which it causes serious disease and mortality for the North American species that have not co-evolved with the rust. As a result, the blackcurrant was banned in the United States as a disease vector for much of the 20th century, and even after the federal ban was lifted in 1966, several U.S. states continued their own bans, some of which remain in force as of August 2021. The effectiveness of these restrictions is questionable, since other &quot;Ribes&quot; species also host the disease, some are native to North America, and others such as red currants and &quot;Ribes uva-crispa&quot; were never banned.

American gooseberry mildew and powdery mildew can infect the leaves and shoot tips, and botrytis may cause the fruit to rot in a wet season. Currant and gooseberry leaf spot (&quot;Drepanopeziza ribis&quot;) is another disease of blackcurrants, but it is not usually a serious problem as most cultivars now have some resistance.

The blackcurrant leaf midge can cause browning, crimping and distortion of leaves at the tips of shoots but it is seldom a serious problem. The blackcurrant sawfly (&quot;Nematus ribesii&quot;) lays its eggs on the underside of the leaves and the voracious larvae work their way along the shoots, stripping off leaf after leaf. In a serious attack, the bush can be denuded of leaves. Larvae of the currant borer drill their way along the centres of shoots, which wilt and die back. Other insect pests include scale insects, aphids and earwigs.

===Research and cultivars===
There are many cultivars of blackcurrant. &#x27;Baldwin&#x27; was the mainstay of the industry for many years but it has now largely been superseded by more productive and disease-resistant varieties. During the 20th century in Europe, much hybridisation work has been carried out in order to reduce the plant&#x27;s susceptibility to disease and frost and also to increase yields. This effort centered mainly in Scotland, Poland, and New Zealand.

In Britain the Scottish Crop Research Institute was tasked with developing new varieties suitable for growing in the north of the country. They produced new cultivars that had greater cold tolerance, especially in the spring, ripened earlier and more evenly and had greater fungal disease resistance. Frost tolerance was improved by selecting for late flowering and genetic research identified genes involved in resistance to gall mite and the blackcurrant reversion virus. &#x27;Ben Lomond&#x27; was the first of the &#x27;Ben&#x27; varieties and was released in 1975. This was followed by several other cultivars for the juicing industry such as &#x27;Ben Alder&#x27; and &#x27;Ben Tirran&#x27;. The cultivar &#x27;Ben Hope&#x27; was released in 1998 with increased tolerance to gall mite, and in the same year, &#x27;Ben Gairn&#x27; became available. It shows resistance to the reversion virus. For gardeners and the pick-your-own market, &#x27;Ben Sarek&#x27;, &#x27;Ben Connan&#x27; and &#x27;Big Ben&#x27; were introduced and have large, sweet berries. The cultivars &#x27;Ben Connan&#x27; and &#x27;Big Ben&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit. and new varieties are being developed continually to improve frost tolerance, disease resistance, machine harvesting, fruit quality, nutritional content and fruit flavour.

Varieties producing green fruit, less strongly flavoured and sweeter than typical blackcurrants, are cultivated in Finland, where they are called &quot;greencurrants&quot; (&quot;viherherukka&quot;). In Poland, the Research Institute of Horticulture has done work on improving the blackcurrant with regard to disease and pest resistance, fruit quality, adaptations to local conditions and mechanical harvesting. Researchers have crossed various varieties and introduced inter-specific genetic material from the gooseberry (&quot;Ribes grossularia&quot;), the redcurrant (&quot;Ribes rubrum&quot;) and the flowering currant (&quot;Ribes sanguineum&quot;). The resulting offspring were further back-crossed to &quot;R. nigrum&quot;. Cultivars produced include &#x27;Tisel&#x27; and &#x27;Tiben&#x27; in 2000 and &#x27;Ores&#x27;, &#x27;Ruben&#x27; and &#x27;Tines&#x27; in 2005. Further cultivars &#x27;Polares&#x27; and &#x27;Tihope&#x27; are being tested. Since 1991, New Zealand has become an important centre for research and development, as its temperate climate is particularly suitable for cultivation of the crop. Breeding programmes are concentrating on yield, large fruit size, consistency of cropping and upright habit.

In North America, there is a need for this fruit to have resistance to white pine blister rust. New cultivars such as &#x27;Crusader&#x27;, &#x27;Coronet&#x27; and &#x27;Consort&#x27; have been developed there by crossing &quot;R. nigrum&quot; with &quot;R. ussuriense&quot; and these show resistance to the disease. However the quality and yield of these varieties are poor as compared to non-resistant strains and only Consort is reliably self-fertile. Back-crossing these varieties to a parent have produced new strains such as &#x27;Titania&#x27; that have a higher yield, better disease resistance, are more tolerant of adverse weather conditions and are suitable for machine harvesting. Two new releases from a black currant breeding program in British Columbia, Canada, &#x27;Blackcomb&#x27; and &#x27;Tahsis&#x27;, were selected for their immunity to white pine blister rust and their frost tolerance.

==Uses==

=== Nutrition ===
Raw blackcurrants are 82% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein and 0.4% fat (table). Per 100 g serving providing 63 kilocalories, the raw fruit has high vitamin C content (218% of the Daily Value, DV) and moderate levels of iron and manganese (12% DV each). Other nutrients are present in negligible amounts (less than 10% DV, table).

Blackcurrant seed oil is rich in vitamin E and unsaturated fatty acids, including alpha-linolenic acid and gamma-linolenic acid.

===History===
Decoction of the leaves, bark or roots was used as a traditional remedy.

During World War II, most fruits rich in vitamin C, such as oranges, became difficult to obtain in the United Kingdom. Since blackcurrant berries are a rich source of the vitamin, and blackcurrant plants are suitable for growing in the UK climate, the British Government encouraged their cultivation and soon the yield of the nation&#x27;s crop increased significantly. From 1942 onwards, blackcurrant syrup was distributed free of charge to children under the age of two. This may have given rise to the lasting popularity of blackcurrant as a flavouring in Britain. In Britain the commercial crop is completely mechanised and about 1,400 hectares of the fruit are grown, mostly under contract to the juicing industry. Commercially, most large-scale cultivation of blackcurrants is done in eastern Europe for the juice and juice concentrate market. , major cultivation efforts to improve fruit characteristics occurred in Scotland, New Zealand, and Poland.

Blackcurrants were once popular in the United States as well, but became less common in the 20th century after currant farming was banned in the early 1900s, when blackcurrants, as a vector of white pine blister rust, were considered a threat to the U.S. logging industry. The federal ban on growing currants was shifted to the jurisdictions of individual states in 1966, and was lifted in New York State in 2003 through the efforts of horticulturist Greg Quinn. As a result, currant growing is making a comeback in New York, Vermont, Connecticut, California, and Oregon. However, several statewide bans still exist . Since the American federal ban curtailed currant production nationally for nearly a century, the fruit remains largely unknown in the United States and has yet to regain its previous popularity to levels enjoyed in Europe or New Zealand. Owing to its unique flavour and richness in polyphenols, dietary fibre and essential nutrients, awareness and popularity of blackcurrant is once again growing, with a number of consumer products entering the U.S. market.

===Culinary===

The fruit of blackcurrants when eaten raw has a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into jams and jellies which set readily because of the fruit&#x27;s high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée can be used to make blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets, and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of &quot;rødgrød&quot;, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.

Blackcurrants are also used in savoury cooking. Their astringency creates added flavour in sauces, meats and other dishes. Blackcurrants are included in some unusual combinations of foods. They can be added to tomato and mint to make a salad. Blackcurrants may accompany roast beef, grilled lamb, duck, seafood and shellfish. Canvasback duck with blackcurrants was a delicacy in nineteenth century New York. They can provide a dipping sauce at barbecues. They can be blended with mayonnaise, and used to invigorate bananas and other tropical fruits. Blackcurrants can be combined with dark chocolate or added to mincemeat in traditional mince pies at Christmas.

Japan imports US$3.6 million of New Zealand blackcurrants for uses as dietary supplements, snacks, functional food products and as quick-frozen (IQF) produce for culinary production as jams, jellies or preserves.

===Beverages===

The juice forms the basis for various squashes, juice drinks, and smoothies. In Britain, 95% of the blackcurrants grown are used to manufacture Ribena (a brand of fruit juice whose name is derived from &quot;Ribes nigrum&quot;) and similar fruit syrups and juices. Macerated blackcurrants are also the primary ingredient in the apéritif, &quot;crème de cassis&quot;, which in turn is added to white wine to produce a Kir or to champagne to make a Kir Royal.

In the UK, a blackcurrant squash may be mixed with beer or alcoholic cider to make drinks including &quot;cider and black&quot;, &quot;lager and black&quot;, or &quot;snakebite and black&quot;.

In Russia, blackcurrant leaves may be used for flavoring tea or preserves, such as salted cucumbers, and berries for home winemaking. Sweetened vodka may also be infused with blackcurrant leaves making a deep greenish-yellow beverage with a tart flavor and astringent taste. The berries may be infused in a similar manner. 

In the Netherlands, blackcurrants are used in a carbonated soft drink named &quot;cassis&quot;, not to be confused with the alcoholic crème de cassis liqueur. The variety by Hero has been made since 1938 with blackcurrant juice concentrate as well as a small quantity of fermented blackcurrant juice.

Blackcurrant seed oil is an ingredient in cosmetics preparations, often in combination with vitamin E. The leaves can be extracted to yield a yellow dye, and the fruit is a source for a blue or violet dye resulting from its rich content of anthocyanins.

<text>The Hobgoblin is the alias of several supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, most of whom are depicted as enemies of the superhero Spider-Man and belong to the collective of adversaries that make up his rogues gallery. Created by writer Roger Stern and artist John Romita Jr., the first incarnation of the Hobgoblin was introduced in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #238 (March 1983) as a criminal mastermind equipped with Halloween-themed weapons similar to those used by the Green Goblin.

The Hobgoblin&#x27;s true identity was one of the longest-running mysteries in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; comics. In 1987, the first version was revealed to be [[Ned Leeds]], Peter Parker&#x27;s journalist co-worker at the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. In 1997, this was retroactively established to be Roderick Kingsley, a fashion designer and Mary Jane Watson&#x27;s former boss (with Ned reframed as a fall guy), and later in the 2020s as the second version who is Baron Mordo&#x27;s secret sorcerer apprentice. Other characters that have assumed the Hobgoblin mantle over the years include criminals Lefty Donovan and [[Jason Macendale]], Roderick&#x27;s twin brother Daniel Kingsley, Spider-Man 2211&#x27;s daughter Robin Borne, Ben Urich&#x27;s nephew [[Phil Urich]], and Kingsley&#x27;s butler Claude. Leeds, Donovan and Claude were first brainwashed via the Winkler Device as part of a scheme orchestrated by the Kingsley brothers, with Kingsley, Macendale, Borne and Urich as the only versions to operate independently of the others (although occasionally partnering with them), with Leeds and Kingsley later also being brainwashed by the Queen Goblin to serve as her enforcers. The Hobgoblin persona has also been utilized by [[Harry Osborn]] in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; comic strip and Ultimate Marvel alternate continuities.

The Hobgoblin has been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including television series and video games. An amalgamated version of the character named Jason Philips appeared in the 1994–1998 &quot;Spider-Man: The Animated Series&quot; voiced by Mark Hamill, while the Harry Osborn incarnation is featured in &quot;Spider-Man&quot; (2017–2018) voiced by Max Mittelman.

Like other writers, Stern found himself under pressure to have Spider-Man fight the Green Goblin again, but did not wish to bring Norman Osborn or Bart Hamilton back from the dead, have Harry Osborn be a villain again, or create another Green Goblin. Stern instead created a new concept as heir to the Goblin legacy and developed the Hobgoblin. Stern recounts that he directed Romita to base it on the Green Goblin costume but to make it &quot;a little more medieval-looking&quot;, while Romita asserts that he was given no direction beyond using the Green Goblin as a basis. Both agree, however, that it was chiefly Romita&#x27;s design.

The Hobgoblin&#x27;s identity was not initially revealed, generating one of the longest-running mysteries in the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; comics. According to Stern, &quot;I plotted that first story with no strong idea of who the Hobgoblin was. As I was scripting those gorgeous pages from [John Romita, Jr.], particularly the last third of the book, and developing the Hobgoblin’s speech pattern, I realized who he was. It was Roderick Kingsley, that sunuvabitch corporate leader I had introduced in my first issue of &quot;[The] Spectacular [Spider-Man]&quot;.&quot; A handful of readers deduced that Kingsley was the Hobgoblin almost immediately. To throw off the scent and in the same stroke provide a retroactive explanation for Kingsley&#x27;s inconsistent characterization in his early appearances, Stern came up with the idea of Kingsley having his brother Daniel Kingsley sometimes impersonate him, sealing the deception by having the Hobgoblin conspicuously appear in the same room as Kingsley in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #249.

Stern&#x27;s original plan was to have the Hobgoblin&#x27;s mystery identity run exactly one issue longer than that of the Green Goblin&#x27;s identity, meaning the truth would be revealed in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #264. However, Stern left after &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #251, and editor Tom DeFalco took his place. Wanting to resolve the mystery in a manner that would do justice to Stern&#x27;s stories, DeFalco asked Stern who the Hobgoblin was, but objected when Stern said it was Kingsley. DeFalco argued that the &quot;twin brother&quot; scheme was cheating the readers since there had been no hint that Roderick even had a brother (aside from a single thought bubble), much less one who could serve as a body double. Stern disagreed but said that DeFalco should feel free to make the choice of which character to use for the Hobgoblin&#x27;s secret identity, Stern reasoning that &quot;I knew that whomever Tom chose, he would make it work.&quot; Upon reviewing the clues, DeFalco decided that the Hobgoblin was Richard Fisk and decided that the Hobgoblin&#x27;s mystery should be prolonged as long as possible, since it was the chief element that made the Hobgoblin interesting. Through both Stern and DeFalco&#x27;s runs, the answer was continuously teased on the cover art, with the covers of &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #245, 251, and 276 all showing Spider-Man having unmasked the Hobgoblin.
The mystery was further complicated after James Owsley came on as editor of the &quot;Spider-Man&quot; titles. Owsley&#x27;s relationship with DeFalco and artist Ron Frenz was strained from the beginning. When Owsley asked who the Hobgoblin was at a creators conference, DeFalco lied and said the man in question was Ned Leeds. Owsley then wrote the one-shot &quot;Spider-Man vs Wolverine&quot; in which Leeds was killed off (though the actual death is not shown), and instructed &quot;The Spectacular Spider-Man&quot; writer Peter David to reveal the Hobgoblin&#x27;s identity as the Foreigner. David objected and argued that the only person who fit the clues was Leeds. Having been present at the Spider-Man creator&#x27;s conference, David also thought that Leeds was who DeFalco intended it to be. Because &quot;Spider-Man vs. Wolverine&quot; had already been drawn, however, it was too late to undo Leeds&#x27;s death. Thus, the Hobgoblin&#x27;s identity was revealed posthumously in the double-sized &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #289. With Spider-Man&#x27;s archenemy now dead, a new storyline was created from Jason Macendale&#x27;s hatred of the Hobgoblin. Though the Hobgoblin&#x27;s posthumous unmasking as Leeds was unpopular with fans, David said in a 2009 interview of still being proud of the story, arguing that the Hobgoblin being unmasked in a climactic battle with Spider-Man was the sort of tale readers had already seen countless times before, whereas having an archvillain unmasked in a flashback after having been brutally killed by nameless assassins was unprecedented and shocking. From 1987 to 1997, Macendale was the Hobgoblin, initially using only the Hobgoblin&#x27;s costume and weaponry, but the 1988–1989 &quot;Inferno&quot; crossover writer Gerry Conway had Macendale imbued with magical powers by the demon N&#x27;astirh by bonding him with a demon. In addition to power over hellfire and increased strength and speed far greater than his predecessor, N&#x27;astirh also disfigures Macendale so that his head resembled the Hobgoblin mask, and ultimately alters his mind so that he was deluded into thinking that his appearance is normal. Several years later, Macendale succeeds in purging himself of his demonic powers and acquires cybernetic implants, the demon that N&#x27;astirh imbued with Macendale becoming Demogoblin.

Stern was unhappy with the revelation that Hobgoblin&#x27;s civilian identity was Leeds and wrote the three-issue miniseries &quot;Spider-Man: Hobgoblin Lives&quot; in 1997, with the retcon that Kingsley was the original Hobgoblin while Leeds was brainwashed into serving as a fall guy, Macendale is killed off, and Kingsley returned. According to Stern, initially he had not known how to resolve the situation of having two Hobgoblins, and it was at the suggestion of the editorial staff that Kingsley kill Macendale and return to operating as the Hobgoblin. Leeds would return as an independent Hobgoblin in the 2019 miniseries &quot;Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality&quot;, revealed to have trained as a sorcerer under Baron Mordo in the art of reality-altering chaos magic, before both Leeds and Kinsley would be brainwashed to together serve as the simultaneous Hobgoblin enforcers of the Queen Goblin in the 2022 storyline &quot;The Hobgoblins&#x27; Last Stand&quot; by Zeb Wells.

Peter Parker: &quot;If you&#x27;re wondering whether the Hobgoblin is Ned Leeds or Roderick Kingsley…&lt;br&gt;…The Answer is “Yes.&quot; It&#x27;s not a whole lot of fun, frankly.&quot;

==Fictional character biography==
===Ned Leeds===

Edward &quot;Ned&quot; Leeds was a reporter working for the &quot;Daily Bugle&quot;. In 1987, he is revealed to be the first Hobgoblin, before being murdered by the Foreigner. Ten years later in 1997, Leeds is retroactively established to have been brainwashed by Roderick Kingsley to act as a stand-in on many occasions and fool the underworld into thinking that he was the Hobgoblin, before Kingsley took back over the role. After a clone of the character was introduced in &quot;Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy&quot;, Leeds is revived in 2021 showing that, under the influence of the brainwashing, he ingested a copy of the Goblin formula which revived him shortly after his initial assassination, before he went into hiding. In 2022, Ned and Kingsley are brainwashed by the Queen Goblin into both resuming their roles as Hobgoblins once more. Synergetic with his MCU adaptation as a sorcerer in the film &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home&quot;, in &quot;Symbiote Spider-Man: Alien Reality&quot;, Ned&#x27;s Hobgoblin is revealed to have trained as a sorcerer under Baron Mordo in the art of reality-altering chaos magic.

Peter Parker: &quot;If you&#x27;re wondering whether the Hobgoblin is Ned Leeds or Roderick Kingsley…&lt;br&gt;…The Answer is “Yes.&quot; It&#x27;s not a whole lot of fun, frankly.&quot;

===Roderick Kingsley===

Roderick Kingsley started out as a socialite, fashion designer and billionaire who had criminal underworld connections and had come about his wealth through unethical business practices and corporate raiding. Coincidentally, Kingsley was an employer of Mary Jane Watson for a time. As a means of avoiding the drill of day-to-day appearances, he had his timid identical twin brother Daniel Kingsley pose as him to run his corporation. Kingsley&#x27;s activities gave him many enemies, one of which was Bella Donna (Narda Ravanna), a rival fashion designer whose business he had ruined and attempted revenge on Kingsley but is twice thwarted by Spider-Man.

After these incidents, Kingsley seeks to protect himself and his empire by gaining more power. The thug George Hill reports to Kingsley of stumbling upon Norman Osborn&#x27;s secret lair in hopes of earning a reward. Kingsley instead kills Hill to make sure that no one else gets wind of the discovery. Upon examining the lair and gleaning its secrets, Kingsley decides to use the Goblin equipment. Arriving to the conclusion that all the previous Green Goblin mantle wearers went mad, he instead creates a similar but different mantle: the Hobgoblin identity. Soon afterwards, he encounters Spider-Man. He uses some of Osborn&#x27;s files to blackmail prominent figures, and attempts to buy Osborn&#x27;s old corporation Oscorp and merge it with his own. These schemes bring him into conflict with Spider-Man. Among Osborn&#x27;s notes, Kingsley also finds incomplete remnants of Mendel Stromm&#x27;s strength enhancing potion and was obsessed with finding the complete formula or perfecting the incomplete notes. During his various criminal activities, Kingsley repeatedly loses to Spider-Man, as he lacked raw physical power. Kingsley eventually perfected the strength-enhancing formula, but, aware that Osborn was driven insane, Kingsley opts to test on someone else first, tricking small-time hood Lefty Donovan after using a mind-control device developed by Gerhard Winkler (Osborn&#x27;s former employee), the &quot;Winkler Device&quot;, able to turn anyone into a Hobgoblin enthralled to another. With Donovan having administered the Goblin formula and then in the Hobgoblin costume to fight Spider-Man, Kingsley monitored his pawn&#x27;s vital signs and behavior from a distance. When Spider-Man overwhelms and unmasks Donovan and the brainwashing begins to fail, Kingsley acts to protect his identity by programming Donovan&#x27;s glider to crash into a building, instantly killing Donovan. Judging the experiment a success, Kingsley immerses himself in his completed formula derivative and gains greater strength than the original Goblin. He uses this strength to battle Spider-Man and the Black Cat. Despite his increased abilities, he is still narrowly defeated by Spider-Man. Worse, he attracts the attention of powerful criminal interests who perceive him as a threat, including the Kingpin. It is also revealed later that during this time, after the Hobgoblin made his appearance, Norman (presumed to be dead at the time) made a brief return to New York City in an attempt to deal with this Goblin, but ultimately abandoned this for the sake of schemes against Spider-Man. After a bitter encounter with Spider-Man, Kingsley discovers he had been followed by &quot;Daily Bugle&quot; reporter Ned Leeds having discovered his lair. Kingsley captured Leeds and brainwashes the reporter with the Winkler Device into being the Hobgoblin. Kingsley discovered that Leeds had been working with Richard Fisk on a plan to bring down the Kingpin&#x27;s empire as Richard adopted the Rose crime lord identity, using Leeds to handle some negotiations, and fooling many criminals into believing that his pawn was the Hobgoblin and hoping to use the Kingpin&#x27;s downfall to advance his own interests. As Leeds gets too erratic to function as a decoy, Kingsley arranged for Leeds to be assassinated by Jason Macendale and the Foreigner while on a trip to Berlin, and decided to retire from the Hobgoblin identity.

During the events of &quot;Secret Wars II&quot;, Kingsley is recruited by Mephisto to join the Legion Accursed, a team of ninety-nine supervillains who try to destroy the Beyonder. The Hobgoblin later kidnaps Harry Osborn. He battles Osborn who uses his own father&#x27;s weaponry against the Hobgoblin.
After a retirement of several years, Kingsley returns to New York. He kills Macendale to prevent from giving the authorities information that would jeopardize his secret identity in addition to seeing Macendale an unworthy successor. Learning that Betty Brant has begun to investigate Ned&#x27;s activities as the Hobgoblin—informed of the truth by Spider-Man after realizing that the Foreigner&#x27;s human operatives could never have killed Leeds if Leeds had been super-powered—Kingsley kidnaps Betty and sets a trap for Spider-Man. In the final fracas, Daniel is captured and the Hobgoblin is unmasked, clearing Ned&#x27;s name. Roderick is taken to prison, imprisoned in the same cell where he killed Macendale. Despite his unmasking, due to Kingsley&#x27;s deceptive natures, it is difficult to determine of whether he is telling the whole truth.

Furious at Norman Osborn&#x27;s return and denial of being the Green Goblin, Kingsley spreads rumors that there exists a secret journal of Osborn&#x27;s that proves beyond doubt that he was the Goblin, but this was later revealed to be a ruse, knowing Osborn has been sending spies on him: all of the journals in his possession had been destroyed during a battle with Spider-Man years before. He offers to barter this information, for his freedom, with the District Attorney, guessing that Osborn will try to get to him first. Osborn, deciding to make a deal with Kingsley, breaks him out of prison. Kingsley is then confronted by both Osborn and another Green Goblin. Osborn provides Kingsley with new Goblin equipment, and both Goblins swoop in to collect Daniel, now in protective custody, who Roderick claims knows the final journal&#x27;s location. Spider-Man defends Daniel, but is drugged and both men are taken back to Osborn. Osborn knew Kingsley was lying about the journal and has bought Kingsley&#x27;s company out from underneath him; the purpose of helping Kingsley escape is for Osborn to personally eliminate the one person who can prove that he is the Goblin. Kingsley furiously attacks Osborn who is shocked to discover that Kingsley is stronger and thus fails at killing him. The building began to burn as a result of their battle, and Spider-Man escapes with Daniel. All three of the villains managed to escape as well. With several million dollars hidden away in foreign bank accounts, Kingsley quietly moves to a small island in the Caribbean to enjoy his retirement.

Kingsley is seemingly killed by Phil Urich who takes on the Hobgoblin mantle, but this was in fact Daniel with Roderick still active in Ecuador under the alias of Devil-Spider. Roderick learns that his brother has been murdered and plans his return to New York. Kingsley arrives in New York City and returns to the Hobgoblin role, intending to go after Urich. Kingsley attacks Urich and the Kingpin in Shadowland. After a brief battle between the two Hobgoblins, Parker and Max Modell escape with the Goblin Key (a key to one of the Goblin warehouses). Kingsley and Urich decide to call a brief truce and go after them. After accessing the warehouse, Peter uses the Goblin tech to make himself a &quot;Spider-Glider&quot; and manages to escape. Urich insists on going after but Kingsley stuns Urich with a taser so they can both escape. Kingsley decides to let Urich remain the Hobgoblin, but only if Urich gives him a cut of whatever profits are made.

Kingsley obtains one of Mysterio&#x27;s suits which he sells to a criminal who takes on the name Mysterion. He sells the Crime Master&#x27;s gear to an unnamed Maggia operative. Hobgoblin ends up in a gang war with the Goblin Nation, selling equipment to low-level criminals who became the latest versions of 8-Ball, Answer, Blaze, Devil-Spider, Gibbon, Hitman, Killer Shrike, Mauler, Melter, Ringer, Steeplejack, Tumbler, and Unicorn as well as a new villain named Bruin who wears one of Grizzly&#x27;s old exoskeleton bear suits. He is killed by the first Goblin King while his henchmen are claimed for the Goblin Nation, but his butler Claude went in his place so that his enemies could be distracted and Kingsley is actually in Paris. Kingsley decides to lay low once again working on his personal empire. It was later revealed that Kingsley sold costumes and gear that made the latest versions of Hydro-Man, Tiger Shark, Squid, and Beetle.

During the &quot;AXIS&quot; storyline, Kingsley appears as a member of Magneto&#x27;s unnamed supervillain group during the fight against the Red Skull&#x27;s Red Onslaught form. When Magneto arrives to recruit him, Kingsley attacks and is subjugated and forced to join Magneto&#x27;s team. Kingsley accompanies Magneto and the other villains recruited to Genosha. The inversion spell caused by Doctor Doom and Scarlet Witch affects not only the Red Skull but all those present in Genosha, making the superheroes present evil and the supervillains present good. Following his inversion, Kingsley returns to New York and finds himself happier with his inversion, although still motivated by greed rather than altruism. He reactivates his franchises where he leases the personas and costumes of deceased or retired superheroes to ordinary people, but remains a wanted criminal. He also enfranchises his Hobgoblin persona to various people to perform heroic deeds as Hobgoblin and publishes a comic about the group for promotion. Among those who answer an ad are the amnesiac Lily Hollister and the underemployed teenager John Myers. Other attendees include a different Demolition Man, Flower Girl, Leather Boy, a character resembling Anti-Venom, a new Razorback, and a new Water Wizard. He sets a three phase program including a book and various articles with his brand and underground speeches named after Ned for people to make their own franchises in exchange for a share of their profits. Kingsley debuts his Hob-Heroes: Lily as Queen Cat, Myers as Missile Mate, Flower Girl, Leatherboy, Rocket Head, and Water Wizard. When the second Goblin King confronts Kingsley in his headquarters, Myers is convinced by Urich&#x27;s claims that Kingsley will soon abandon the heroes he has trained. Missile Mate goes to Urich&#x27;s headquarters and asks to join to be a supervillain. Urich is reluctant, but Myers shows also gathering all the supervillains Kingsley &quot;abandoned&quot; after being a good guy. When the celebration of a &quot;Hobgoblin Day&quot; is being held with a parade in Kingsley&#x27;s honor, Missile Mate betrays Kingsley and attempts to murder him in the Goblin King&#x27;s name. Kingsley has already expected the betrayal and has been using a hologram decoy which takes Missile Mate&#x27;s blow. As soon as Kinglsey confronts Missile Mate, Urich appears with the Goblin Nation and attacks the celebration. Kingsley bests Urich in combat and leaves his rival to the authorities. After, he is approached by Steve Rogers to be part of a team of Avengers with the objective to stop the inverted X-Men from detonating a gene bomb which would kill everyone on the Earth who wasn&#x27;t a mutant. The Avengers team that Kingsley joins is called the Astonishing Avengers. After the reinversion spell is cast to restore the Avengers and X-Men members that were affected by it back to the side of good, Kingsley is evil again.

Kingsley was also revealed to have sold one of Goldbug&#x27;s costume to an unnamed criminal to establish his version of Goldbug.

Kingsley starts to get his old franchises back under control. Outside of recruiting Blizzard, Kingsley regains his former minions Beetle, Bruin, Hitman, Ringer, and Unicorn as well as establishing his versions of Cutthroat, Diamondback, Mockingbird, and Viper. When franchisee Porcupine informs him of an intent to end the contract, Kingsley tries to kill with a Pumpkin Bomb to reclaim said suit for future franchisees. In the resulting battle with Porcupine and crimefighting mentor Spider-Woman, Kingsley is taken down by Captain Marvel.

Kingsley turns up as a member of the Sinister Six led by the Iron Spider. He accompanies the Sinister Six in a plot to steal a decommissioned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier.

Kingsley later attempted to enter into a business deal with the sin-purged Osborn who returned the companies he had stolen from Kingsley years earlier in an attempt to put an end to their ongoing feud. Subsequently, in the storyline &quot;The Hobgoblins&#x27; Last Stand&quot;, both Kingsley and Leeds are brainwashed by the Queen Goblin using the Winkler Device into both resuming their roles as Hobgoblins once more, serving as her maniacal enforcers.

Peter Parker: &quot;If you&#x27;re wondering whether the Hobgoblin is Ned Leeds or Roderick Kingsley…&lt;br&gt;…The Answer is &quot;Yes.&quot; It&#x27;s not a whole lot of fun, frankly.&quot;

During the &quot;Gang War&quot; storyline, the Hobgoblin is shown to run Bushwick, Brooklyn, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, having broken free from the Queen Goblin&#x27;s influence. Hobgoblin is shown looking at a map of Brooklyn. The Hobgoblin approaches Aaron Davis outside his apartment for help with a &quot;spider problem&quot;. The Hobgoblin and the Prowler provide weapons for the Enforcers in order to sway them to Hobgoblin&#x27;s side. The Hobgoblin later watches the altercation between the new Spider-Man and the Cape Killers on his screen. As the Hobgoblin works with Rabble on an invention using technology stolen from the Beyond Corporation, they also mention plan to go after the Queen Goblin. In addition to keep his hideout safe, Hobgoblin had hired Goldbug III, Lady Stilt-Man, Man-Bull, Mr. Fish I, Ricadonna, and Shocker to be his hired muscle. When Spider-Man, the Prowler, Ms. Marvel, and Cape-Killers member Gust enter the building, Spider-Man and Ms. Marvel are ambushed by the Hobgoblin and Rabble. During Spider-Man, Ms. Marvel, and Gust&#x27;s fight with the Hobgoblin and Rabble, Spider-Man notices that the Hobgoblin&#x27;s suit has been upgraded as the Hobgoblin&#x27;s drones show up. In the nick of time, the Scorpion, Shift, and Starling show up after the Scorpion convincing the hired villains to turn against the Hobgoblin when the Scorpion asked them when was the last time a Goblin had followed through on their promises that were made to them. While Rabble gets away, the Hobgoblin sets off every one of his pumpkin bombs vowing to see Spider-Man soon. After everyone evacuates, the hideout explodes, although Spider-Man doubts that the Hobgoblin died in the explosion.

===Lefty Donovan===
Arnold Samuel &quot;Lefty&quot; Donovan was a petty thug. Similar to Osborn, Donovan was a test subject mix the two vital chemicals that were mixed into the Goblin formula, disfiguring Donovan&#x27;s face and granting superhuman abilities. Donovan is taken to a hospital. Brainwashed by the Winkler Device, Donovan eventually escapes the hospital and follows preprogrammed instructions to go to a hidden cache of Goblin weapons and dress up as the Hobgoblin. Donovan impersonated the Hobgoblin and attacks New York City but Spider-Man confronts and unmasks him. Spider-Man sees his (scarred) face and recognizes Lefty. As Donovan is able to shake off some of his programing and starts talking, his &quot;boss&quot; programmed the Goblin glider to crash into the side of a building, killing Lefty instantly on impact.

===Jason Macendale===

Jason Philip Macendale Jr. was a mercenary who had been trained by the CIA (and various para-military organizations). He first appeared as the supervillain Jack O&#x27;Lantern before eventually adopting the Hobgoblin identity.

===Fifth version===
An unidentified fifth Hobgoblin was introduced in the series &quot;Secret War&quot;. With very little to know about him (including his true identity), the only thing to know is that he received his equipment from the Tinkerer. He was sent along with Lady Octopus to attack Captain America in his civilian identity by the terrorist-elements wound into the events of the Secret War. Chatter from the Goblin indicated he&#x27;d been in contact with other members of Spider-Man&#x27;s rogues gallery, who&#x27;d warned him about Spider-Man&#x27;s constant and inane joking. This Hobgoblin is jailed along with the various defeated villains after the conclusion of the &quot;War&quot;.

===Daniel Kingsley===
Daniel Kingsley is Roderick Kingsley&#x27;s twin brother. He would act as a body double until being exposed by Betty Brant while the true Hobgoblin gets unmasked by Spider-Man. Now in protective custody, Daniel was unknowingly used by Roderick to blackmail Norman Osborn, resulting in the Hobgoblin to swoop in to collect Daniel. Spider-Man defends Daniel but is drugged while Daniel passes out and both are taken to Osborn. As Kingsley and Osborn furiously fight each other, Daniel gets rescued by Spider-Man. Kingsley later returned to New York, posing as his twin brother as the Hobgoblin. Kingsley investigated an old lair at OsCorp which had a flaming energy sword, but discovers Phil Urich trying to retrieve the same gear. Kingsley gets stunned by Urich&#x27;s &quot;Lunatic Laugh&quot; long enough for Urich to kill him using his own sword, allowing his killer to claim the Hobgoblin mantle.

===Phil Urich===

Phillip Benjamin &quot;Phil&quot; Urich (who once used the Green Goblin identity to operate as a superhero) took on the Hobgoblin identity himself as a supervillain with some new gear (new body armor, a winged jetpack, and a flaming energy sword).

===Norman Osborn===

Norman Osborn briefly impersonated the original Hobgoblin.

===Claude===
Claude was Roderick&#x27;s butler who was sent in place and to talk like his master to distract the Goblin Nation. He fought against and was killed in battle by the Goblin Knight who then discovered it was Claude who was killed and destroyed his body to keep the Goblin King from finding out about the imposter Hobgoblin.

==Powers, abilities, and equipment==
As the Hobgoblin, Roderick Kingsley wears bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic, cape, and cowl. A computerized system cybernetically causes the finger-blasters to randomly vary their attack vectors when trained on a particular target. He uses a Goblin glider, a one-man miniature turbo-fan-powered vertical thrust, cybernetically-controlled vehicle. It can reach high velocities and is extremely maneuverable. He uses concussion and incendiary Jack O&#x27;Lanterns, wraith-shaped smoke and gas-emitting bombs, bat shaped razor-edged throwing blades, and gloves woven with micro-circuited power conducting filaments which channel pulsed discharges of electricity. He wore a shoulder bag to carry his small, portable weaponry.

Prior to his assassination, Ned Leeds wore the Hobgoblin&#x27;s uniform and used the Goblin glider and equipment which included Jack O&#x27;Lantern bombs, razor bats and electrical shock gloves. However, he had no healing factor or superhuman strength. Following his ingesting the Goblin Formula and subsequent resurrection, Ned developed superhuman strength, speed, reflexes, and stamina as well as a low-level rapid healing factor, the latter of which allow him to survive otherwise fatal gunshot wounds. Wielding chaos magic following his training as a sorcerer under Baron Mordo, Ned&#x27;s Hobgoblin is capable of sensing other magic users, as well as casting spells relating to flight, teleportation, time manipulation, elemental manipulation, and reality warping, using the latter skill to rewrite reality around Spider-Man and himself to make himself Sorcerer Supreme, before he is defeated by Spider-Man, although he is able to use his magic to fake his death in the aftermath, before returning years later under the guise of having been a &quot;patsy for the &#x27;real&#x27; Hobgoblin&quot;, free to resume his plans.

As the Hobgoblin, Phil Urich wears an orange Hobgoblin costume with wings on the back that allow him to fly without the use of a Goblin glider and he took the Hobgoblin mask as his own. He uses the traditional Pumpkin Bombs all Green Goblins and Hobgoblins before him have used, but he also has a new flaming sword. He still retains his &quot;Lunatic Laugh&quot; and he also has superhuman strength, speed, durability, stamina, reflexes and senses, and enhanced intellect. For unknown reasons, he no longer needs his Goblin mask to activate this power. With the help of Reverbium, his &quot;Lunatic Laugh&quot; was able to cause a building to collapse.

==Alternative versions==
===&quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline in the pages of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man: Renew Your Vows&quot;, the Roderick Kingsley version of the Hobgoblin appears as a member of Regent&#x27;s Sinister Six where they are tasked to hunt down Spider-Man. During the fight with Spider-Man, the Hobgoblin&#x27;s hand was webbed up by Spider-Man before he could throw his Pumpkin Bomb which led to Hobgoblin getting killed in its explosion.

===Hobgoblin 2211===

Hobgoblin 2211 first appears in &quot;Spider-Man 2099 Meets Spider-Man&quot;. While her costume sports the twentieth-century Green Goblins&#x27; green-and-purple color scheme, she boasted that she was the Hobgoblin of 2211. Her identity was not revealed to readers (or to the visiting Spider-Men of previous eras) at the time, but her later reappearance in &quot;Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man&quot; (also written by David) revealed her true identity and origin.

Hobgoblin 2211 is Robin &quot;Hobby&quot;/&quot;Hob&quot; Borne, Spider-Man&#x27;s daughter. Her father always seemed to put his superhero career before raising his own daughter. She wanted to save the universes from &#x27;intersecting&#x27;; in other words, having other parallel universes merge with the existing one, causing it to override. She was later arrested by her father for something that she would have done in future: unauthorized time travel, chronal displacement, jumping the tracks to other realities. She was held in a virtual reality prison where she lives a benign and trouble-free existence in what appears to be Kansas. Her boyfriend attempts to free her by uploading a virus into the prison, but inadvertently causes her to be driven insane. She attacked her father with a &#x27;retcon bomb&#x27; (a variation on the original Goblins&#x27; pumpkin bombs) but it hit her boyfriend instead, erasing (or &#x27;retconning&#x27;) him from existence.

Now suited up as the Hobgoblin, Robin managed to time-travel to the current year, attacking the current Spider-Man in his reality and derailing an Uncle Ben from another reality into the present one causing a time paradox. Later, in a confrontation with her father, she threw a &#x27;retcon bomb&#x27; at him. Spider-Man, believing it to be no more harmful than a regular pumpkin bomb, caught it with his web and threw it back to Robin, unwittingly erasing her from existence.

===&quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;===
In the last issue of &quot;JLA/Avengers&quot;, the Hobgoblin is among the enthralled villains defending Krona&#x27;s stronghold, and is defeated by Hawkgirl.

===&quot;Marvel Adventures&quot;===
In this continuity, the Hobgoblin is an unidentified criminal who found a stash of Green Goblin&#x27;s weaponry because he had forgotten to leave the entrance locked. Delighted at his new technological power he challenges the Green Goblin to a confrontation. Spider-Man defeats them both.

===MC2===
The Roderick Kingsley version of Hobgoblin made his MC2 debut as a hired assassin to kill many of the Spider-Girl characters, including Normie Osborn, Spider-Girl, and Peter Parker. After a fight against both Spider-Girl and her father, he came close to victory, but at the end his only success lay in killing the Venom symbiote, and also in escaping without a trace. He attempted a complex plot to become the new kingpin of crime, but was undone due to an act of treachery by his partner, the Mindworm. Killing the Mindworm, and deciding the New York underworld had become too &quot;hot&quot; for him at the moment, he chose to return to the Caribbean, but vowed someday to come back and finish off Spider-Girl. He is later revealed to be the instigator of a mob war against the Black Tarantula, returning to New York to finish the job. He defeated American Dream and the New Warriors. He then dropped them from a great height, planning to kill Spider-Girl as she tried to save them. However, he himself was then killed by Mayhem, Spider-Girl&#x27;s half-symbiote clone.

===Harry Osborn===

Harold &quot;Harry&quot; Osborn is an equivalent of the Hobgoblin in two different Marvel continuities. 

====Newspaper strip====
In &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; newspaper strip by Stan Lee and Larry Lieber, Harry as the Hobgoblin has repeatedly attacked Spider-Man, seeking vengeance for Norman Osborn&#x27;s death. After trying to kill both Spider-Man and Black Widow after, under hypnotic influence of psychiatrist &quot;Dr. Stone&quot; (actually spy-assassin Dimitri Gregorin who has killed friends of the Black Widow in the past), Harry, seeing Spider-Man&#x27;s heroism, realizes that Spider-Man is a hero, his father was a murderer, and vows to never assume the Hobgoblin identity again.

====Ultimate Marvel====
The Ultimate Marvel equivalent of the Hobgoblin is Harry when a second personality takes control.

===&quot;Old Man Logan&quot;===
In the pages of &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; that took place on Earth-21923, the Roderick Kingsley version of Hobgoblin was among the villains that attacked the Avengers in Connecticut. He worked with the Vulture to fight Wasp only for the Wasp to use her stingers to shoot the Hobgoblin off his Goblin Glider.

=== &quot;Spider-Man: Spider&#x27;s Shadow&quot; ===
Around the events of &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #258 (November 1984), the Hobgoblin battles with black suit Spider-Man; during the fight, the Hobgoblin is unmasked as Roderick Kingsley, so Spider-Man threatens to Kingsley to not attack innocent civilians anymore. Kingsley causes an explosion at May Parker&#x27;s house when he sees Spider-Man change into Peter Parker using the Venom symbiote; The symbiote shifts blame into Kingsley for May&#x27;s death, and changes into a monstrous form. Spider-Man uses his fingers to kill Kingsley who is regarded as Spider-Man&#x27;s first victim.

===&quot;Spider-Geddon&quot;===
In the &quot;Spider-Geddon&quot; event on Earth-11580, a version of Hobgoblin is seen alongside the Green Goblin, Jack O&#x27;Lantern and Demogoblin during the Goblin Night. Under the orders of the Goblin Queen, they try to kill Gwen Stacy, but Spiders-Man arrives and defeats the Goblins.

===&quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;===
In the alternate continuity of &quot;Spider-Gwen&quot;, the Green Goblin uses an army of Hobgoblin-based androids to assist him during his assault against Spider-Woman.

===Spider-Verse===
The &quot;Spider-Verse&quot; had two versions of Hobgoblin:

====Hobgoblin of Earth-21205====
Overwhelmed with rage over the death of Gwen Stacy, the Earth-21205 version of Peter Parker, as Spider-Man, murdered the Green Goblin and later retired his Spider-Man identity. He soon after became &quot;the Goblin&quot;, a villain similar in costume to the Hobgoblin. This character was later targeted by Verna of the Inheritors (alongside the Hounds Scorpion and Rhino) as a Spider-Totem. The Spider-Woman of Earth-65 attempted to recruit him into a growing army of Spiders to protect him from the Inheritors, but he initially turned the offer down. When Spider-Woman revealed herself to be an alternate version of Gwen, he sacrificed himself to save her as atonement for failing to do so in his own dimension.

====Hobgoblin of Earth-001====
The Earth-001 version of Hobgoblin appeared as a member of Verna&#x27;s Hounds alongside the multiple Green Goblins. The Hobgoblin and the other goblin-themed Hounds attacked Silk, Spider-Woman of Earth-65, and Black Widow of Earth-1610. He is killed by the Superior Spider-Man, Assassin Spider-Man, and Spider-Punk.

===Sword-and-sorcery===
In the 2007 &quot;Spider-Man/Red Sonja&quot; mini-series, the Hobgoblin was one of several supervillains who was transformed into a sword-and-sorcery version of themselves due to the spell cast by Kulan Gath. It was never specified which version of Hobgoblin it was.

<doc id="172174" wikidata="Q216125" url="?curid=172174" title="Réseau Express Régional">
<text>The Réseau Express Régional (; ), commonly abbreviated RER (), is a hybrid commuter rail and rapid transit system, similar to the S-Bahns of German-speaking countries and the S Lines of Milan, serving Paris and its suburbs. It acts as a combined city-center underground rail system and suburbs-to-city-center commuter rail. In the city center, it acts as a faster counterpart of the Paris Métro, having fewer stops.

Conceived of as a &quot;métropolitain express&quot; (express metro) during the mid 1930s, the scheme was revived in the 1950s and construction began in the early 1960s. The RER was not fully conceptualised until the completion of the &quot;Schéma directeur d&#x27;aménagement et d&#x27;urbanisme&quot; (roughly: &quot;master plan for urban development&quot;) in 1965. The RER network, which initially comprised two lines, was formally inaugurated on 8 December 1977 in a ceremony that was attended by President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing. A second phase of construction commenced at the end of the 1970s which saw additional lines constructed along with extensions to the original two. The RER is operated partly by RATP, the authority that operates most of the public transport in Paris, and partly by the SNCF, France&#x27;s national rail operator.

As of 2023, the network consists of five lines: A, B, C, D and E. The network has 257 stations and has interchanges with the Métro and commuter rail within the City of Paris and the suburbs. The lines are identified by letters to avoid confusion with the Métro lines, which are identified by numbers. The network is still expanding: RER E, which opened in 1999, is planned for westward extension toward La Défense and Mantes-la-Jolie in two phases by 2024–2026. The performance of the RER has made it a model for proposals to improve transit within other cities. In November 2022, French President Emmanuel Macron announced the creation of the additional RERs that will serve the ten largest French metropolises by 2040.

==Characteristics==
The RER contains 257 stations, 33 of which are within the city of Paris, and runs over of track, including underground. Each line passes through the city almost wholly underground and on tracks dedicated to the RER, but some city center tracks are shared between line D and line B. The RER is operated partly by RATP, the authority that operates most public transport in Paris, and partly by SNCF, the national rail operator. The system, which is structured in a traditional radial arrangement, operates a through-service and uses a single fare model that works seamlessly with several other public transit systems. Total traffic on the central sections of lines A and B, operated by RATP, was 452 million people in 2006; in the same year, total traffic on all Paris area commuter lines operated by SNCF (both RER and Transilien trains) was 657 million.

RATP manages 65 RER stations, including all stations on Line A east of Nanterre-Préfecture and those on the branch to Saint-Germain-en-Laye. It also operates stations on Line B south of Gare du Nord. Other stations on the two lines and those on lines C, D and E are operated by SNCF. Of the RER stations operated by RATP, 9 have interchanges with Métro lines, and 9 allow transfer to SNCF&#x27;s Transilien service. In comparison to the Metro, the RER provides better coverage of Paris&#x27; suburbs and typically operates at higher speeds and with greater distances between stations. Within the city center, RER services practice limited stop operations.

==History==

===Origins===

Its roots are in the 1936 &quot;Ruhlmann-Langewin&quot; plan of the Compagnie du chemin de fer métropolitain de Paris (Metropolitan Railway Company of Paris) for a &quot;métropolitain express&quot; (express metro). The company&#x27;s post-war successor, RATP, revived the scheme in the 1950s, and in 1960 an interministerial committee decided to go ahead with the construction of an east-west line. Subsequently, the central part of the RER was completed between 1962 and 1977 in a large-scale civil engineering project whose chief supervisor was Siavash Teimouri. The construction of the RER was a major undertaking, being highly visible to both Parisians and visiting tourists at various sites across the city for an extended period.

As its instigator, RATP was granted authority to run the new link. The embryonic (and as yet unnamed) RER was not properly conceived until the 1965 &quot;Schéma directeur d&#x27;aménagement et d&#x27;urbanisme&quot; (roughly: &quot;master plan for urban development&quot;), which envisioned an H-shaped network with two north-south routes. Between 1969 and 1970, RATP purchased the Vincennes and Saint-Germain lines from SNCF, as the basis for the east-west link. Only a single north-south route crossing the Left Bank has so far come to fruition, although the Métro&#x27;s line 13 has been extended to perform a similar function.

The RER&#x27;s first phase of construction during the 1960s and 1970s was marked by scale and expense. In 1973 alone, FRF 2 billion were committed to the project in the budget, equating to roughly €1.37 billion in 2005 terms, and closer to double that as a proportion of the region&#x27;s (then much smaller) economic output. The construction cost was controversial at the time of its construction. This initial investment, along with subsequent spending, was partly financed by the &quot;versement transport&quot;, a local tax levied on businesses that was introduced in July 1971. It has remained in effect into the twenty-first century.

===First phase===

During the first phase of construction, the Vincennes and Saint-Germain lines became the ends of the east-west Line A, the central section of which was opened station by station between 1969 and 1977. On its completion, Line A was joined by the initial southern section of the north-south Line B. Both Lines A and B were intentionally designed to converge with as many of the existing commuter lines as possible as to maximise its usefulness to existing travelers. During this first phase, six new stations were built, three of which are entirely underground.

Construction was inaugurated by Robert Buron, then Minister for Public Works, at the Pont de Neuilly on 6 July 1961, four years before the publication of the official network blueprint. The rapid expansion of the La Défense business district in the west made the western section of the first line a priority. Nation, the first new station, was opened on 12 December 1969 and became for the next 8 years the new western terminus of the Vincennes line. The section from Étoile (not yet renamed after Charles de Gaulle) to was opened a few weeks later. It was later extended eastward to the newly built on 23 November 1971, and westward to Saint-Germain-en-Laye on 1 October 1972. The latter extension was achieved by a connection to the existing Saint-Germain-en-Laye line, the oldest railway line into Paris, at Nanterre.

The RER network was inaugurated on 8 December 1977 with the joining of the eastern -Boissy segment and the western - segment at . The inauguration was attended by President Valery Giscard D&#x27;Estaing. The southern &quot;Ligne de Sceaux&quot; was simultaneously extended from Luxembourg to meet Line A at &quot;Châtelet – Les Halles&quot;, becoming the new Line B. The system of line letters was introduced to the public on this occasion, though it had been used internally by RATP and SNCF for some time.

===Second phase===

A second phase of construction commenced at the end of the 1970s, which was carried out at a slower pace than the first phase. SNCF gained the authorisation to operate its own routes, which became lines C, D and E. Extensive sections of suburban tracks were added to the network, but only four new stations were built.

During 1979, Line C (along the Left Bank of the Seine) was added, although it almost entirely comprised existing SNCF lines. The main civil engineering works performed involved the construction of a connecting link between Invalides and Musée d&#x27;Orsay. In 1981, Line B was extended through to Gare du Nord via a new deep tunnel from Châtelet – Les Halles. It was later extended further northward. By 1992, a total of 233 miles of track was operational, while a further 94 miles were under construction.

During 1995, Line D (north to south-east via Châtelet – Les Halles) was completed; its primary feature was a purpose-built deep tunnel between Châtelet – Les Halles and Gare de Lyon. No new building work was necessary at Châtelet – Les Halles, as additional platforms for Line D had been built at the time of the station&#x27;s construction 20 years earlier. In 1999, Line E was added to the network, connecting the north-east with Gare Saint-Lazare by means of a new deep tunnel from Gare de l&#x27;Est.

==Rolling stock==
The predominance of suburban SNCF track on the RER network explains why RER trains use overhead line power and run on the left, like SNCF trains (except in Alsace-Moselle), contrary to the Métro where trains use third rail power and run on the right. RER trains run by the two different operators share the same track infrastructure, a practice called interconnection. On the RER, interconnection required the development of specific trains (MI 79 series for &quot;Materiel d&#x27;Interconnexion&quot; 1979, and MI 2N series for &quot;Materiel d&#x27;Interconnexion à 2 niveaux&quot; (double-deck interconnection stock)) capable of operating under both 1.5 kV direct current on the RATP network and 25 kV / 50 Hz alternating current on the SNCF network. The MS 61 series (&quot;Matériel Suburbain 1961&quot;) can be used only on the 1.5 kV DC network.

The RER&#x27;s tunnels have unusually large cross-sections. This is due to a 1961 decision to build them according to a loading gauge standard created by the Union Internationale des Chemins de Fer (UIC), with space for overhead catenary power supply to trains. Single-track tunnels measure 6.30 m across and double-track tunnels up to 8.70 m, meaning a cross-sectional area of up to 50 square metres, larger than that of the &quot;stations&quot; on many comparable underground rail networks.

The first RER rolling stock in fact predated the formation of the RER by 40 years, with the Z 23000 stock used on the &quot;ligne de Sceaux&quot; (which was thereafter integrated into RER B) from 1937 until 27 February 1987. In 1965 the Z 5300 train was introduced, followed by the MS 61 in 1967, MI 79 in 1980, MI 84 and Z 8800 in 1985, Z 20500 in 1988, MI 2N in 1996, Z 20900 in 2001, MI 09 on 5 December 2011, Z 50000 (Francilien) in 2015 and Regio 2N (Z 57000) in 2019. In 2017, it was announced that an consortium comprising Alstom and Bombardier Transportation had been selected to supply 255 X’Trapolis Cityduplex double-deck electric multiple units to replace aging rolling stock on both lines D and E under a €3.75 billion arrangement. In April 2023, 60 additional Cityduplexs were ordered to increase service frequency.

Many services are performed by double-decker train sets, usually operating in double formations.

==Stations==

Ten new stations have been built under the heart of Paris since the 1960s as part of the RER project. The six stations of Line A opened between 1969 and 1977 are:

* (1969): deep construction at the &quot;Place de la Nation&quot;.
* (1970): deep construction at the Arc de Triomphe.
* (1970): near-surface construction beneath the site of the yet-to-be-built Grande Arche de la Défense, just outside the Paris city boundary.
* (1971): deep construction near Gare Saint-Lazare.
* (1977): near-surface construction on the site of the former marketplace, claimed in 2017 to be the largest underground station in Europe.
* Gare de Lyon (1977): near-surface construction beneath and alongside the main-line SNCF station.

Some controversy followed the construction of the Line A. Using the model of the existing Métro, and unlike any other underground network in the world, engineers elected to build the three new deep stations (Étoile, and ) as single monolithic halls with lateral platforms and no supporting pillars. A hybrid solution of adjacent halls was rejected on the grounds that it &quot;completely sacrificed the architectural aspect&quot; of the oeuvre. The scale in question was vast: the new &quot;stations cathédrales&quot; were up to three times longer, wider and taller than Métro stations, and hence 20 or 30 times more voluminous. Most importantly, unlike the Métro they were to be constructed deep underground. The decision turned out to be expensive: around 8 billion francs for the three stations, equivalent to €1.2 billion in 2005 terms, with the two-level the costliest of the three. The comparison was obvious and unfavourable with London&#x27;s Victoria line, a deep line of constructed during the same period using a two-tunnel approach at vastly lower cost though with a lower capacity. However, the three stations represent undeniable engineering feats and are noticeably less claustrophobic than traditional underground stations.

Only two stations were inaugurated to complete Lines B, C and D:

* Gare du Nord (1982): near-surface construction on two levels.
* St-Michel - Notre-Dame (1988): deep construction on an existing stretch of the Line B between Luxembourg and Châtelet - Les Halles with two tunnels, common in other underground systems but unique in Paris. The station is situated on and built at the same time as the Luxembourg Châtelet tunnel.

Two stations were added to the network as part of Line E in the 1990s. They are notable for their lavishly spacious deep construction, a technique not used since . Although similar to the three 1960s &quot;cathedral stations&quot; of Line A, their passenger traffic has so far proved vastly lower.

* (1999): deep construction serving both &quot;Gare du Nord&quot; and Gare de l&#x27;Est.
* (1999): deep construction serving Gare Saint-Lazare and &quot;Auber&quot;.

==Usage==

Journey times, particularly on east-west and north-south routes, have been reduced by the RER; in combination with the cross-platform connection at Châtelet - Les Halles, even certain &quot;diagonal&quot; trips have reduced journey times. Typically being used for leisure journeys, the RER has made a significant social impact. By bringing far-flung suburbs within easy reach of central Paris, the network has aided the reintegration of the traditionally insular capital with its periphery. Evidence of this social impact can be seen at Châtelet - Les Halles, whose neighbourhood and Forum des Halles leisure and shopping facilities are popular among &quot;banlieusards&quot; (suburbanites), in particular from eastern suburbs.

Lines A and B reached saturation relatively quickly, exceeding by far all traffic expectations: up to 55,000 passengers per hour in each direction on Line A (1992), the highest such figure outside of East Asia. Despite a frequency of more than one train every two minutes, made possible by the installation of digital signalling in 1989, and the gradual introduction of double-decker trains from 1998 to 2017, the central stations of Line A are critically crowded at peak times. In June 2015, a contract valued at €20 million was awarded to Alstom Transport to develop and install an automatic train operation (ATO) system on RER A; at the time, this line was the most heavily frequented regional line in Europe, the introduction of ATO enabled increased service frequency and improved performance to be achieved.

The RER has a substantial impact on the suburban areas of greater Paris, specifically on land values near the stations along its lines. The RER has received criticism for its high level of particle pollution during busy periods, largely due to train braking. Pollution by PM10 particles regularly reaches 400 μg/m3 at , much more than at neighboring metro stations and eight times the EU Commission&#x27;s daily average limit of 50 μg/m3.

<text>Tula de Allende (Otomi: Mämeni) is a town and one of the 84 municipalities of Hidalgo in central-eastern Mexico. The municipality covers an area of , and as of 2010, the municipality had a total population of 103,919. The municipality includes numerous smaller outlying towns, the largest of which are El Llano, San Marcos, and San Miguel Vindho. It is a regional economic center and one of Mexico&#x27;s fastest growing cities. However, it is best known as the home of the Tula archeological site, noted for its Atlantean figures. Its built-up area (or metro) made up of Atotonilco de Tula, Atitalaquia, Tlaxcoapan municipalities was home to 188,659 inhabitants at the 2010 census.

==City of Tula de Allende==
The city of Tula de Allende was built on what was the southern extension of the ancient city of Tula, centered on a former monastery built by the Spanish in the 16th century. The modern city is still connected to the ancient ruins, which are an important tourist attraction as well as a symbol of the city, especially the warrior figures located on the Quetzalcoatl pyramid. Toltec finds are not uncommon underneath the modern city. In 2009, Toltec burials from 900-1100CE were found under Tula-Iturbe Boulevard along with several kilns for firing pottery.

The modern city is a regional economic center and has been listed as one of the fastest growing in Mexico by the National Commission of Population. Most of the reason for this is the existence of a refinery and a thermoelectric plant.

The city is centered around the parish and former monastery of San Jose, with the oldest part built between 1546 and 1556. The main facade has three arches, pilasters with reliefs, a curved pediment and a chapel annex that takes from the 17th century. The cloister of the monastery has two levels with arches and fresco murals. Inside the main church, there is a modern mural called “Jesus” located at the main altar. It was named a cathedral in 1961.

Near here is a main plaza and an open-air theatre, framed by a mural called “Tula Eterna” created by Juan Pablo Patiño Cornejo. Another mural called “Tianguis Mamehni” is found at the chamber of commerce. There is also the Plaza de las Artesanias dedicated to local handcrafts including replicas of the atlas figures.

==The municipality==
The government of the city of Tula de Allende is also the government for a total of 76 communities. The city is the largest community, with a population of about 27,000. Other important communities include El Llano (11,000 people), San Miguel Vindho (10,500), San Marcos (10,400), Bomintzha (3,000), Santa Ana Ahuehuepan (2,600), Santa Maria Macua (1,750), Ignacio Zaragoza, (1,750), Nantzha (1740), Xochitlan de las Flores (1,300), Colonia San Francisco Bojay (1,250) and Monte Alegre (1,200). The government consists of a municipal president, fourteen administrators, 54 delegates and fourteen commissions.

==History==
The name is derived from the Nahuatl phrase Tollan-Xicocotitlan, which means near where cattails grow. Tula is the Hispanicized pronunciation of Tollan. In Otomi the area is called Namehi, which means “place of many people.” It was given the appendage of “de Allende” in honor of Ignacio Allende who fought in the Mexican War of Independence.

The area was the capital of one of the major civilizations of Mesoamerica, that of the Toltecs. The Toltecs rose to power after 713 CE as the successor to Teotihuacan. The current city is centered just south of the ceremonial center of the ancient city, which is famous for its Atlantean figures. The Toltec Empire reached as far south as the Valley of Mexico and its influence has been found in artifacts as far away as the current U.S. Southwest. It is believed that aguamiel was first extracted around 1100CE, which led to the making of pulque. The last Toltec ruler was Topilzin Ce-Acatl Quetzalcoatl who came to power in 1085.

According to the Codex Mendoza, the site was conquered under the reign of Tizoc and subsequently incorporated into the Aztec Empire

After the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Pedro Miahuazochil was named in 1531 as the lord of Tula helping to evangelize the area.

Tula became a municipality in 1871.

The Tula area was the scene of various battles during the Mexican Revolution, particularly between those loyal to Venustiano Carranza and those to Emiliano Zapata.

==Geography==

The municipality is located in the south of the Mezquital Valley in the southwest of the state of Hidalgo. With an extension of 305.8 km2 it borders the municipalities of Tepetitlán, Tlahuelilpan, Tepeji del Río, Atotonilco de Tula, Atitalaquía and Tlaxcoapan, with the State of Mexico to the west.

The city of Tula has an altitude of 2,020 meters above sea level Most of the municipality is semi flat with only one significant elevation completely in the municipality known as Magoni. Elevations in the west form the border between it and the State of Mexico. These include Magueni and La Malinche. In the north there is a small mountain of volcanic origin called Xicuco.

Surface water is mostly found in the Tula River, the Rosas River and the Arroyo Grande, whose waters are stored in the Endho Dam. The Tula River begins with the discharge from the Valley of Mexico which pass north through the State of Mexico before reaching the area. The Rosas River also begins in the State of Mexico but with clean waters from a fresh water spring. It has carved some small canyons in the area.

Pollution problems generally come from the PEMEX refinery and the discharge of wastewater from the Valley of Mexico into the Tula River.

===Flora and fauna===
The natural vegetation is mostly semi desert, with cactus and maguey plants the most defining followed by mesquite and the pirul tree (&quot;Schinus molle&quot;) along with seasonal grass. Native fauna includes rabbits, squirrels, chameleons, roadrunners, coyotes, various kinds of birds and snakes, skunks and opossums.

===Climate===
The municipality&#x27;s climate varies from temperate to cold with an average annual temperature of . It has an average annual rainfall of , with most rain falling from May to September.

== Politics ==
==Economy==
The city and municipality have a very low level of socioeconomic marginalization but median household income varies between US$10,641 and $5,037 a year. The city is a regional economic center. The nucleus of its economic sphere includes the municipalities of Tula de Allende, Atitalaquuia, Atotonilco de Tula, Chapantongo and Nopala de Villagrán. Other municipalities which are affected include Tepetitlán, Tepeji del Río, Tlahualilpan, Tlaxcoapan, Tezontepec de Aldama, Soyaniquilpan de Juárez and Jilotepec .

Of the economically active population (minus students and retirees), just under ten percent work in agriculture and livestock; just over 33 percent work in manufacturing and mining and about 55 percent work in commerce, services and tourism. 97% of the land is held in common, generally in ejidos, for agricultural purposes. The main crops are corn, beans, oats, wheat, vegetables such as squash, tomatillos and chili peppers, alfalfa, nopal cactus, cactus fruit, peaches and avocados. Livestock includes sheep, goats, cattle and pigs along with domestic fowl. Fishing is mostly limited to sporting catching carp and catfish.

There are firms dedicated to manufacturing, mineral extraction and construction as well as &quot;maquiladoras&quot;. The most important of these are the Francisco Pérez Ríos Thermoelectric plant and the PEMEX refinery as well as the Cruz Azul and Tolteca cement locations. The refinery was established in 1976, and makes gasoline, diesel and solvents. It has 35 plants in eleven sections, covering an area of . It processes just under 25% of Mexico&#x27;s crude employing about 3,500 workers. The main handcraft in the city is the making of replicas of Toltec stone pieces. The altas figures are also recreated in way, marble, plastic and clay. Textiles are also made especially quezquémetl, rebozos, sarapes, hats and baskets.

Commerce is mainly for local needs such as groceries and clothing. There are two main traditional markets in the city of Tula, the municipal market and the &quot;Tianguis&quot;. The latter generally concentrates on electronics. The major service sector is related to tourism. This is mostly focused on visitors to the Tula archeological site. There is also the Requena dam (boating, fishing and picnicking) and the Parque Acuático la Cantera, a water park with a pool and thermal springs. The municipality has two four star hotels and two three star hotels.

The municipality&#x27;s infrastructure includes of federal highway, of state highway, of rural highway and of rail line. It has a main bus terminal with local and intercity bus service. Trains that regularly pass through include the Mexico City–Ciudad Juárez line and the Mexico City-Tula-Querétaro line. It still has telegraph service, one of the oldest still in service after 100 years. Postal service in the town is also one of Mexico&#x27;s oldest, beginning in 1856. There are two radio stations, FM XHLLV and “Super Stereo 90.9”.

== Demography ==
=== Populated places in Tula de Allende ===
The census of 2010 reported a population of 103,919 people: 53,429 females and 50,490 males. The municipality has a total population of 103,919, living in 26,937 households, with 581 speaking an indigenous language.

The Tula de Allende municipality is very big, and includes many cities, towns, and small communities. The biggest city is Tula de Allende, and the second largest city is Cruz Azul City (near to San Miguel Vindho and Santa María Ilucan). Tula-Tepeji, the third Metropolitan Area in Hidalgo state, is the most important population center in the Mezquital valley.

==Culture and education== 
Eighty seven percent of the population is Catholic, with most of the rest practicing some form of Catholicism. The main feast day is dedicated to Saint Joseph on March 19. There is also a large annual pilgrimage from here to the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City with many traveling by foot.

Traditional garb for men consists of pants and shirt made of undyed cotton cloth along with a sombrero. Women&#x27;s traditional dress is a dress made of the some cloth often with a crinoline skirt underneath, decorated with ribbons and embroidery although beads and sequins are also used. A wool rebozo is common in the winter. For charreada events, men can be seen in charro outfits and women in China Poblana dress.

Traditional dishes of the area include barbacoa, carnitas, pulque, nopal cactus with eggs, beans with epazote and mixote but the area is known for dishes made with escamoles (ant eggs) as well as mezcal worms which are both seasonal. Street food such as gorditas is popular in the local markets.
The most important museum in the municipality is the site museum for the Tula archeological site called the Jorge R. Acosta Museum, which is run by INAH.

The municipality has 73 preschools, 66 primary schools, 30 middle schools, thirteen high schools and at higher level the Universidad Politecnica de la Energia and the Universidad Tecnológica de Tula-Tepeji, with a total of about thirty thousand students. This is sufficient for the lower levels but not for higher education.

==Tula archeological site==
The ceremonial center of ancient Tula is located about five minutes from the center of the modern city. Tula became the most important city in the region after the fall of Teotihuacan, although it never reached the same size due to competing cities in the area. Usually identified as the Toltec capital around 980 CE, the city was destroyed at some time between 1168 and 1179.

The site is at and around the junction of two rivers, the Río Rosas and the Río Tula. The two largest clusters of grand ceremonial architecture are nicknamed &quot;Tula Grande&quot; (the most visited by tourists) and &quot;Tula Chico&quot;. Remains of other buildings extend for some distance in all directions. Tula Grande contains pyramids, Mesoamerican ball courts and other buildings but its most distinctive characteristics are the Atlantean figures, columns in the shape of warriors and the “Serpent Wall,” a wall with reliefs that serve as a predecessor to similar constructions in later cultures.

The archeological site was made a national park in 1981 by the Mexican government. The park covers an area of 1 km2.

<doc id="172179" wikidata="Q189768" url="?curid=172179" title="Application layer">
<text>An application layer is an abstraction layer that specifies the shared communication protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communications network. An &quot;application layer&quot; abstraction is specified in both the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) and the OSI model. Although both models use the same term for their respective highest-level layer, the detailed definitions and purposes are different.

==Internet protocol suite==

In the Internet protocol suite, the application layer contains the communications protocols and interface methods used in process-to-process communications across an Internet Protocol (IP) computer network. The application layer only standardizes communication and depends upon the underlying transport layer protocols to establish host-to-host data transfer channels and manage the data exchange in a client–server or peer-to-peer networking model. Though the TCP/IP application layer does not describe specific rules or data formats that applications must consider when communicating, the original specification (in ) does rely on and recommend the robustness principle for application design.

==OSI model==

In the OSI model, the definition of the application layer is narrower in scope. The OSI model defines the application layer as only the interface responsible for communicating with host-based and user-facing applications. OSI then explicitly distinguishes the functionality of two additional layers, the session layer and presentation layer, as separate levels below the application layer and above the transport layer. OSI specifies a strict modular separation of functionality at these layers and provides protocol implementations for each. In contrast, the Internet Protocol Suite compiles these functions into a single layer. 

===Sublayers===
Originally the OSI model consisted of two kinds of application layer services with their related protocols. These two sublayers are the common application service element (CASE) and specific application service element (SASE). Generally, an application layer protocol is realized by the use of the functionality of a number of application service elements. Some application service elements invoke different procedures based on the version of the session service available.

====CASE====
The common application service element sublayer provides services for the application layer and request services from the session layer.
It provides support for common application services, such as:
* ACSE (Association Control Service Element)
* ROSE (Remote Operation Service Element)
* CCR (Commitment Concurrency and Recovery)
* RTSE (Reliable Transfer Service Element)

====SASE====
The specific application service element sublayer provides application-specific services (protocols), such as:
* FTAM (File Transfer, Access and Manager)
* VT (Virtual Terminal)
* MOTIS (Message Oriented Text Interchange Standard)
* CMIP (Common Management Information Protocol)
* JTM (Job Transfer and Manipulation)
* MMS (Manufacturing Messaging Specification)
* RDA (Remote Database Access)
* DTP (Distributed Transaction Processing)

==Protocols==
The IETF definition document for the application layer in the Internet Protocol Suite is RFC 1123. It provided an initial set of protocols that covered the major aspects of the functionality of the early Internet:
* Hypertext documents: Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
* Remote login to hosts: Telnet, Secure Shell
* File transfer: File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP)
* Electronic mail transport: Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
* Networking support: Domain Name System (DNS)
* Host initialization: BOOTP
* Remote host management: Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), Common Management Information Protocol over TCP (CMOT)

===Examples===
Additional notable application-layer protocols include the following:

*9P, Plan 9 from Bell Labs distributed file system protocol
*AFP, Apple Filing Protocol
*APPC, Advanced Program-to-Program Communication
*AMQP, Advanced Message Queuing Protocol
*Atom Publishing Protocol
*BEEP, Block Extensible Exchange Protocol
*Bitcoin
*BitTorrent
*CFDP, Coherent File Distribution Protocol
*CoAP, Constrained Application Protocol
*DDS, Data Distribution Service
*DeviceNet
*DNS, Domain Name Services
*eDonkey
*ENRP, Endpoint Handlespace Redundancy Protocol
*FastTrack (KaZaa, Grokster, iMesh)
*Finger, User Information Protocol
*Freenet
*FTAM, File Transfer Access and Management
*FTP, File Transfer Protocol
*Gemini, Gemini protocol
*Gopher, Gopher protocol
*HL7, Health Level Seven
*HTTP, Hypertext Transfer Protocol

<doc id="172180" wikidata="Q219817" url="?curid=172180" title="French Directory">
<text>The Directory (also called Directorate; ) was the governing five-member committee in the French First Republic from 26 October 1795 (4 Brumaire an IV) until November 1799, when it was overthrown by Napoleon Bonaparte in the Coup of 18 Brumaire and replaced by the Consulate. In mainstream historiography, the term &quot;Directoire&quot; is also used to refer to the period (i.e. from the dissolution of the National Convention on 26 October 1795 to Napoleon&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état), coinciding with the final four years of the French Revolution.

The Directory was continually at war with foreign coalitions, including Britain, Austria, Prussia, the Kingdom of Naples, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It annexed Belgium and the left bank of the Rhine, while Bonaparte conquered a large part of Italy. The Directory established 29 short-lived sister republics in Italy, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The conquered cities and states were required to send France huge amounts of money, as well as art treasures, which were used to fill the new Louvre museum in Paris. An army led by Bonaparte tried to conquer Egypt and marched as far as Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Acre in Syria. The Directory defeated a resurgence of the War in the Vendée, the royalist-led civil war in the Vendée region, but failed in its venture to support the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and create an Irish Republic.

The French economy was in continual crisis during the Directory. At the beginning, the treasury was empty; the paper money, the assignat, had fallen to a fraction of its value, and prices soared. The Directory stopped printing assignats and restored the value of the money, but this caused a new crisis; prices and wages fell, and economic activity slowed to a standstill.

In its first two years, the Directory concentrated on ending the excesses of the Jacobin Reign of Terror; mass executions stopped, and measures taken against exiled priests and royalists were relaxed. The Jacobin political club was closed on 12 November 1794 and the government crushed an armed uprising planned by the Jacobins and an early socialist revolutionary, François-Noël Babeuf, known as &quot;&quot;Gracchus&quot; Babeuf&quot;. But after the discovery of a royalist conspiracy including a prominent general, Jean-Charles Pichegru, the Jacobins took charge of the new Councils and hardened the measures against the Church and émigrés. They took two additional seats in the Directory, hopelessly dividing it.

In 1799, after several defeats, French victories in the Netherlands and Switzerland restored the French military position, but the Directory had lost all the political factions&#x27; support, including some of its Directors. Bonaparte returned from Egypt in October, and was engaged by Abbé Sieyès and others to carry out a parliamentary coup d&#x27;état on 9–10 November 1799. The coup abolished the Directory and replaced it with the French Consulate led by Bonaparte.

==Background==

The period known as the Reign of Terror began as a way of harnessing revolutionary fervour, but quickly degenerated into the settlement of personal grievances. On 17 September 1793, the Law of Suspects authorised the arrest of any suspected &quot;enemies of freedom&quot;; on 10 October, the National Convention recognised the Committee of Public Safety under Maximilien Robespierre as the supreme authority, and suspended the Constitution until &quot;peace was achieved&quot;.

According to archival records, from September 1793 to July 1794 some 16,600 people were executed on charges of counter-revolutionary activity; another 40,000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial. At its peak, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thoughts could place one under suspicion, and even his supporters began to fear their own survival depended on removing Robespierre. On 27 July, he and his allies were arrested and executed the next day.

In July 1794, the Convention established a committee to draft what became the 1795 Constitution. Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, it established a bicameral legislature, intended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems. Deputies were chosen by indirect election, a total franchise of around 5 million voting in primaries for 30,000 electors, or 0.5% of the population. Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification, it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies.

The Directory was established after the Constitution of Year III which was adopted by a referendum on 24 September 1795, and constituted after the first elections which were held from 12–21 October 1795. On 25 October the National Convention held its last meeting; the Committee of Public Safety was dissolved or rather disappeared before the end of the month. On 31 October, in addition to Paul Barras, Jean-François Reubell, Louis-Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux, Étienne-François Le Tourneur and Emmanuel-Joseph Sieyès were chosen as Directors.

At the end of October a legislature consisting of the Council of 500 was created, responsible for drafting legislation, and Council of Ancients, an upper house containing 250 men over the age of 40, who would review and approve it. Executive power was in the hands of five Directors, selected by the Council of Ancients from a list provided by the lower house, with a five-year mandate. This was intended to prevent executive power being concentrated in the hands of one man.

D&#x27;Anglas wrote to the Convention:
We propose to you to compose an executive power of five members, renewed with one new member each year, called the Directory. This executive will have a force concentrated enough that it will be swift and firm, but divided enough to make it impossible for any member to even consider becoming a tyrant. A single chief would be dangerous. Each member will preside for three months; he will have during this time the signature and seal of the head of state. By the slow and gradual replacement of members of the Directory, you will preserve the advantages of order and continuity and will have the advantages of unity without the inconveniences.

===Drafting the new Constitution===

The 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen was attached as a preamble, declaring &quot;the Rights of Man in society are liberty, equality, security, and property&quot;. It guaranteed freedom of religion, freedom of the press, and freedom of labour, but forbade armed assemblies and even public meetings of political societies. Only individuals or public authorities could tender petitions.

The judicial system was reformed, and judges were given short terms of office: two years for justices of the peace, five for judges of department tribunals. They were elected, and could be re-elected, to assure their independence from the other branches of government.

The new legislature had two houses, a Council of Five Hundred and a Council of Ancients with two hundred fifty members. Electoral assemblies in each &quot;canton&quot; of France, which brought together a total of thirty thousand qualified electors, chose representatives to an electoral assembly in each department, which then elected the members of both houses. The members of this legislature had a term of three years, with one-third of the members renewed every year. The Ancients could not initiate new laws, but could veto those proposed by the Council of Five Hundred.

The Constitution established a unique kind of executive, a five-man Directory chosen by the legislature. It required the Council of Five Hundred to prepare, by secret ballot, a list of candidates for the Directory. The Council of Ancients then chose, again by secret ballot, the Directors from that provided list. The Constitution required that Directors be at least forty years old. To assure gradual but continual change, one Director, chosen by lot, was replaced each year. Ministers for the various departments of State aided the Directors. These ministers did not form a council or cabinet and had no general powers of government.

The new Constitution sought to create a separation of powers; the Directors had no voice in legislation or taxation, nor could Directors or Ministers sit in either house. To assure that the Directors would have some independence, each would be elected by one portion of the legislature, and they could not be removed by the legislature unless they violated the law.

Under the new Constitution of 1795, to be eligible to vote in the elections for the Councils, voters were required to meet certain minimum property and residency standards. In towns with over six thousand population, they had to own or rent a property with a revenue equal to the standard income for at least one hundred fifty or two hundred days of work, and to have lived in their residence for at least a year. This ruled out a large part of the French population.

The greatest victim under the new system was the City of Paris, which had dominated events in the first part of the Revolution. On 24 August 1794, the committees of the sections of Paris, bastions of the Jacobins which had provided most of the manpower for demonstrations and invasions of the Convention, were abolished. Shortly afterwards, on 31 August, the municipality of Paris, which had been the domain of Danton and Robespierre, was abolished, and the city placed under direct control of the national government. When the Law of 19 Vendémiaire Year IV (11 October 1795), in application of the new Constitution, created the first twelve &quot;arrondissements&quot; of Paris, it established twelve new committees, one for each &quot;arrondissement&quot;. The city became a new department, the Department of the Seine, replacing the former Department of Paris created in 1790.

===Political developments (July 1794 – March 1795)===

Meanwhile, the leaders of the still ruling National Convention tried to meet challenges from both neo-Jacobins on the left and royalists on the right. On 21 September 1794, the remains of Jean-Paul Marat, whose furious articles had promoted the Reign of Terror, were placed with great ceremony in the Panthéon, while on the same day, the moderate Convention member Merlin de Thionville described the Jacobins as &quot;A hangout of outlaws&quot; and the &quot;knights of the guillotine&quot;. Young men known as Muscadins, largely from middle-class families, attacked the Jacobin and radical clubs. The new freedom of the press saw the appearance of a host of new newspapers and pamphlets from the left and the right, such as the royalist &quot;L&#x27;Orateur du peuple&quot; edited by Stanislas Fréron, an extreme Jacobin who had moved to the extreme right, and at the opposite end of the spectrum, the &quot;Tribun du peuple&quot;, edited by Gracchus Babeuf, a former priest who advocated an early version of socialism. On 5 February 1795, the semi-official newspaper &quot;Le Moniteur Universel&quot; (&quot;Le Moniteur&quot;) attacked Marat for encouraging the bloody extremes of the Reign of Terror. Marat&#x27;s remains were removed from the Panthéon two days later. The surviving Girondin deputies, whose leaders had been executed during the Reign of Terror, were brought back into the Convention on 8 March 1795.

The Convention tried to bring a peaceful end to the Catholic and royalist uprising in the Vendée. The Convention signed an amnesty agreement, promising to recognize the freedom of religion and allowing territorial guards to keep their weapons if the &quot;Vendéens&quot; would end their revolt. On a proposal from Boissy d&#x27;Anglas, on 21 February 1795 the Convention formally proclaimed the freedom of religion and the separation of church and state.

===Foreign policy===
Between July 1794 and the October 1795 elections for the new-style Parliament, the government tried to obtain international peace treaties and secure French gains. In January 1795 General Pichegru took advantage of an extremely cold winter and invaded the Dutch Republic. He captured Utrecht on 18 January, and on 14 February units of French cavalry captured the Dutch fleet, which was trapped in the ice at Den Helder. The Dutch government asked for peace, conceding Dutch Flanders, Maastricht and Venlo to France. On 9 February, after a French offensive in the Alps, Ferdinand III, Grand Duke of Tuscany signed a treaty with France. Soon afterwards, on 5 April, France signed a peace treaty, the Peace of Basel, with Prussia, where King Frederick William II was tired of the war; Prussia recognized the French occupation of the western bank of the Rhine. On 22 July 1795, a peace agreement, the &quot;Treaty of Basel&quot;, was signed with Spain, where the French Revolutionary Army had marched as far as Bilbao in the War of the Pyrenees. By the time the Directory was chosen, the coalition against France was reduced to Britain and Austria, which hoped that Russia might be brought in on its side.

=== Failed Jacobin coup (May 1795) and rebellion in Brittany (June–July) ===
On 20 May 1795 (1 Prairial Year III), the Jacobins attempted to seize power in Paris. Following the model of Danton&#x27;s seizure of the National Assembly in June 1792, a mob of sans-culottes invaded the meeting hall of the Convention at the Tuileries Palace, killed one deputy, and demanded that a new government be formed. This time the army moved swiftly to clear the hall. Several deputies who had taken the side of the invaders were arrested. The uprising continued the following day, as the sans-culottes seized the &quot;Hôtel de Ville&quot; as they had done in earlier uprisings, but with little effect; crowds did not move to support them. On the third day, 22 May, the army moved into and occupied the working-class neighborhood of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine. The sans-culottes were disarmed and their leaders were arrested. In the following days the surviving members of the Committee of Public Safety, the committee that had been led by Robespierre, were arrested, with the exception of Carnot and two others. Six of the deputies who had participated in the uprising and had been sentenced to death committed suicide before they were taken to the guillotine.

On 23 June 1795, the Chouans, royalist and Catholic rebels in Brittany, formed an army of 14,000 men near Quiberon. With the assistance of the British navy, a force of two thousand royalists was landed at Quiberon. The French army under General Lazare Hoche reacted swiftly, forcing the royalists to take refuge on the peninsula and then to withdraw. They surrendered on 21 July; 748 of the rebels were executed by firing squad.

=== Adoption of the new Constitution ===

The new Constitution of the Year III was presented to the Convention and debated between 4 July – 17 August 1795, and was formally adopted on 22 August 1795. It was a long document, with 377 articles, compared with 124 in the first French Constitution of 1793. Even before it took effect, however, the members of the Convention took measures to assure they would still have dominance in the legislature over the government. They required that in the first elections, two hundred and fifty new deputies would be elected, while five hundred members of the old Convention would remain in place until the next elections. A national referendum of eligible voters was then held. The total number of voters was low; of five million eligible voters, 1,057,390 electors approved the Constitution, and 49,978 opposed it. The proposal that two thirds of members of the old Convention should remain in place was approved by a much smaller margin, 205,498 to 108,754.

=== October 1795 royalist rebellion ===

The new Constitution of the Year III was officially proclaimed in force on 23 September 1795, but the new Councils had not yet been elected, and the Directors had not yet been chosen. The leaders of the royalists and constitutional monarchists chose this moment to try to seize power. They saw that the vote in favor of the new Constitution was hardly overwhelming. Paris voters were particularly hostile to the idea of keeping two-thirds of the old members of the Convention in the new Councils. A central committee was formed, with members from the wealthier neighborhoods of Paris, and they began planning a march on the center of the city and on the Tuileries, where the Convention still met.

The members of the Convention, very much experienced with conspiracies, were well aware that the planning was underway. A group of five republican deputies, led by Paul Barras, had already formed an unofficial directory, in anticipation of the creation of the real one. They were concerned about the National Guard members from western Paris, and were unsure about the military commander of Paris, General Jacques-François Menou. Barras decided to turn to military commanders in his entourage who were known republicans, particularly Napoleon Bonaparte, whom he had known when Bonaparte was successfully fighting the British in Toulon. Bonaparte, at this point a general of second rank in the Army of the Interior, was ordered to defend the government buildings on the right bank.

The armed royalist insurgents planned a march in two columns along both the right bank and left bank of the Seine toward the Tuileries. There on 5 October 1795, the royalists were met by the artillery of &quot;sous-lieutenant&quot; Joachim Murat at the Sablons and by Bonaparte&#x27;s soldiers and artillery in front of the church of Saint-Roch. Over the next two hours, the &quot;whiff of grapeshot&quot; of Bonaparte&#x27;s cannons and gunfire of his soldiers brutally mowed down advancing columns, killing some four hundred insurgents, and ending the rebellion. Bonaparte was promoted to General of Division on 16 October, and General in Chief of the Army of the Interior on 26 October. It was the last uprising to take place in Paris during the French Revolution.

== History ==
=== Directory takes charge ===
Between 12 and 21 October 1795, immediately after the suppression of royalist uprising in Paris, the elections for the new Councils decreed by the new Constitution took place. 379 members of the old Convention, for the most part moderate republicans, were elected to the new legislature. To assure that the Directory did not abandon the Revolution entirely, the Council required that all of the members of the Directory be former members of the Convention and regicides, those who had voted for the execution of Louis XVI.

Due to the rules established by the Convention, a majority of members of the new legislature, 381 of 741 deputies, had served in the Convention and were ardent republicans, but a large part of the new deputies elected were royalists, 118 versus 11 from the left. The members of the upper house, the Council of Ancients, were chosen by lot from among all of the deputies.

On 31 October 1795, the Council of Ancients chose the first Directory from a list of candidates submitted by the Council of Five Hundred. One person elected, the Abbé Sieyès, refused to take the position, saying it didn&#x27;t suit his interests or personality. A new member, Lazare Carnot, was elected in his place.

The members elected to the Directory were the following:
* Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras, a member of a minor noble family from Provence, Barras had been a revolutionary envoy to Toulon, where he met the young Bonaparte, and arranged his promotion to captain. Barras had been removed from the Committee of Public Safety by Robespierre. Fearing for his life, Barras had helped organize the downfall of Robespierre. An expert at political intrigue, Barras became the dominant figure in the Directory. His leading opponent in the Directory, Carnot, described him as &quot;without faith and without morals... in politics, without character and without resolution... He has all the tastes of an opulent prince, generous, magnificent and dissipated.&quot;
* Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux was a fierce republican and anti-Catholic, who had proposed to execute Louis XVI after the flight to Varennes. He promoted the establishment of a new religion, theophilanthropy, to replace Christianity.
* Jean-François Rewbell had an expertise in foreign relations, and was a close ally of Paul Barras. He was a firm moderate republican who had voted for the death of the king but had also opposed Robespierre and the extreme Jacobins. He was an opponent of the Catholic church and a proponent of individual liberties.
* Étienne-François Le Tourneur was a former captain of engineers, and a specialist in military and naval affairs. He was a close ally within the Directory of Carnot.
* Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot took the place of Abbé Sieyés, who was elected by the Ancients but refused the position. Carnot was an army captain at the beginning of the Revolution, and when elected to the Convention became a member of the commission of military affairs, as well as a vocal opponent of Robespierre. He was an energetic and efficient manager, who restructured the French military and helped it achieve its first successes, earning him the title of &quot;The Organizer of the Victory&quot;. Napoleon, who later made Carnot his Minister of War, described him as &quot;a hard worker, sincere in everything, but without intrigues, and easy to fool.&quot;

The following day, the members of the new government took over their offices in the Luxembourg Palace, which had previously been occupied by the Committee of Public Safety. Nothing had been prepared, and the rooms had no furniture: they managed to find firewood to heat the room, and a table in order to work. Each member took charge of a particular sector: Rewbell diplomacy; Carnot and Le Tourneur military affairs, La Révellière-Lépeaux religion and public instruction, and Barras internal affairs.

The Council of Ancients was attributed the building at the Tuileries Palace formerly occupied by the Convention, while the Council of Five Hundred deliberated in the &quot;Salle du Manège&quot;, the former riding school west of the palace in the Tuileries Garden. One of the early decisions of the new parliament was to designate uniforms for both houses: the Five Hundred wore long white robes with a blue belt, a scarlet cloak and a hat of blue velour, while members of the Ancients wore a robe of blue-violet, a scarlet sash, a white mantle, and a violet hat.

=== Finance and economy ===
The new Director overseeing financial affairs, La Réveillière-Lépeaux, gave a succinct description of the financial state of France when the Directory took power: &quot;The national Treasury was completely empty; not a single sou remained. The assignats were almost worthless; the little value which remained drained away each day with accelerated speed. One could not print enough money in one night to meet the most pressing needs of the next day... The public revenues were nonexistent; citizens had lost the habit of paying taxes. [...] All public credit was dead and all confidence lost. [...] The depreciation of the &quot;assignats&quot;, the frightening speed of the fall, reduced the salary of all public employees and functionaries to a value which was purely nominal.&quot;

The drop in value in the money was accompanied by extraordinary inflation. The &quot;Louis d&#x27;or&quot; (gold coin), which was worth 2,000₶. in paper money at the beginning of the Directory, increased to 3,000₶. and then 5,000₶. The price of a liter of wine increased from 2₶.10s. in October 1795 to 10₶. and then 30₶. A measure of flour worth 2₶. in 1790 was worth 225₶. in October 1794.

The new government continued to print &quot;assignats&quot;, which were based on the value of property confiscated from the Church and the aristocracy, but it could not print them fast enough; even when it printed one hundred million in a day, it covered only one-third of the government&#x27;s needs. To fill the treasury, the Directory resorted in December 1795 to a forced loan of 600 million-₶. from wealthy citizens, who were required to pay between 50₶. and 6,000₶. each.
To fight inflation, the government began minting more coins of gold and silver, which had real value; the government had little gold but large silver reserves, largely in the form of silverware, candlesticks and other objects confiscated from the churches and the nobility. It minted 72 million écus, and when this silver supply ran low, it obtained much more gold and silver through military campaigns outside of France, particularly from Bonaparte&#x27;s army in Italy. Bonaparte demanded gold or silver from each city he conquered, threatening to destroy the cities if they did not pay.

These measures reduced the rate of inflation. On 19 February 1796, the government held a ceremony in the Place Vendôme to destroy the printing presses which had been used to produce huge quantities of &quot;assignats&quot;. This success produced a new problem: the country was still flooded with more than two billion four hundred million (2.400.000.000) &quot;assignats&quot;, claims on confiscated properties, which now had some value. Those who held &quot;assignats&quot; were able to exchange them for state mandates, which they could use to buy châteaux, church buildings and other biens nationaux (state property) at extremely reduced prices. Speculation became rampant, and property in Paris and other cities could change hands several times a day.

Another major problem faced by the Directory was the enormous public debt, the same problem that had led to the Revolution in the first place. In September–December 1797, the Directory attacked this problem by declaring bankruptcy on two-thirds of the debt, but assured payment on the other third. This resulted in the ruin of those who held large quantities of government bonds, but stabilized the currency. To keep the treasury full, the Directory also imposed new taxes on property owners, based on the number of fireplaces and chimneys, and later on the number of windows, of their residences. It refrained from adding more taxes on wine and salt, which had helped cause the 1789 revolution, but added new taxes on gold and silver objects, playing cards, tobacco, and other luxury products. Through these means, the Directory brought about a relative stability of finances which continued through the Directory and Consulate.

=== Food supply ===
The food supply for the population, and particularly for the Parisians, was a major economic and political problem before and during the Revolution; it had led to food riots in Paris and attacks on the Convention. To assure the supply of food to the sans-culottes in Paris, the base of support of the Jacobins, the Convention had strictly regulated grain distribution and set maximum prices for bread and other essential products. As the value of the currency dropped, the fixed prices soon did not cover the cost of production, and supplies dropped. The Convention was forced to abolish the maximum on 24 December 1794, but it continued to buy huge quantities of bread and meat which it distributed at low prices to the Parisians. This Paris food distribution cost a large part of the national budget, and was resented by the rest of the country, which did not have that benefit. By early 1796, the grain supply was supplemented by deliveries from Italy and even from Algeria. Despite the increased imports, the grain supply to Paris was not enough. The Ministry of the Interior reported on 23 March 1796 that there was only enough wheat to make bread for five days, and there were shortages of meat and firewood. The Directory was forced to resume deliveries of subsidized food to the very poor, the elderly, the sick, and government employees. The food shortages and high prices were one factor in the growth of discontent and the Gracchus Babeuf&#x27;s uprising, the Conspiracy of the Equals, in 1796. The harvests were good in the following years and the food supplies improved considerably, but the supply was still precarious in the north, the west, the southeast, and the valley of the Seine.

=== Babeuf&#x27;s Conspiracy of the Equals ===

In 1795, the Directory faced a new threat from the left, from the followers of François Noël Babeuf, a talented political agitator who took the name &quot;Gracchus&quot; and was the organizer of what became known as the Conspiracy of the Equals. Babeuf had, since 1789, been drawn to the Agrarian Law, an agrarian reform preconized by the ancient Roman brothers, Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, of sharing goods in common, as means of achieving economic equality. By the time of the fall of Robespierre, he had abandoned this as an impractical scheme and was moving towards a more complex plan. Babeuf did not call for the abolition of private property, and wrote that peasants should own their own plots of land, but he advocated that all wealth should be shared equally: all citizens who were able would be required to work, and all would receive the same income. Babeuf did not believe that the mass of French citizens was ready for self-government; accordingly, he proposed a dictatorship under his leadership until the people were educated enough to take charge. &quot;People!&quot;, Babeuf wrote. &quot;Breathe, see, recognize your guide, your defender... Your tribune presents himself with confidence.&quot;

At first, Babeuf&#x27;s following was small; the readers of his newspaper, &quot;Le Tribun du peuple&quot; (&quot;The Tribune of the People&quot;), were mostly middle-class far-left Jacobins who had been excluded from the new government. However, his popularity increased in the working-class of the capital with the drop in value of the &quot;assignats&quot;, which rapidly resulted in the decrease of wages and the rise of food prices. Beginning in October 1795, he allied himself with the most radical Jacobins, and on 29 March 1796 formed the &quot;Directoire secret des Égaux&quot; (&quot;Secret Directory of Equals&quot;), which proposed to &quot;revolutionize the people&quot; through pamphlets and placards, and eventually to overthrow the government. He formed an alliance of utopian socialists and radical Jacobins, including Félix Lepeletier, Pierre-Antoine Antonelle, Sylvain Marechal, Jean-Pierre-André Amar and Jean-Baptiste Robert Lindet. The Conspiracy of Equals was organized in a novel way: in the center was Babeuf and the Secret Directory, who hid their identities, and shared information with other members of the Conspiracy only via trusted intermediaries. This conspiratorial structure was later adopted by Marxist movements. Despite his precautions, the Directory infiltrated an agent into the conspiracy, and was fully informed of what he was doing. Bonaparte, the newly named commander of the Army of the Interior, was ordered to close the Panthéon Club, the major meeting place for the Jacobins in Paris, which he did on 27 February 1796. The Directory took other measures to prevent an uprising; the Legion of Police (&quot;légion de police&quot;), a local police force dominated by Jacobins, was forced to become a part of the Army, and the Army organized a mobile column to patrol the neighborhoods and stop uprisings.

Before Babeuf and his conspiracy could strike, he was betrayed by a police spy and arrested in his hiding place on 10 May 1796. Though he was a talented agitator, he was a very poor conspirator; with him in his hiding place were the complete records of the conspiracy, with all of the names of the conspirators. Despite this setback, the conspiracy went ahead with the Grenelle camp affair. On the night of 9–10 September 1796, between 400 and 700 Jacobins went to the 21st Regiment of Dragoons (&quot;21e régiment de dragons&quot;) army camp at Grenelle and tried to incite an armed rebellion against the Directory. At the same time a column of militants was formed in the working-class neighborhoods of Paris to march on the Luxembourg Palace, headquarters of the Directory. Director Carnot had been informed the night before by the commander of the camp, and a unit of dragoons was ready. When the attack began at about ten o&#x27;clock, the dragoons appeared suddenly and charged. About twenty Jacobins were killed, and the others arrested. The column of militants, learning what had happened, disbanded in confusion. The widespread arrest of Babeuf&#x27;s militants and Jacobins followed. The practice of arresting suspects at their homes at night, stopped after the downfall of Robespierre, was resumed on this occasion.

Despite his arrest, Babeuf, in jail, still felt he could negotiate with the government. He wrote to the Directory: &quot;Citizen Directors, why don&#x27;t you look above yourselves and treat with me as with an equal power? You have seen now the vast confidence of which I am the center... this view makes you tremble.&quot; Several attempts were made by Babeuf&#x27;s followers to free him from prison. He was finally moved to Vendôme for trial. The Directory did not tremble. The accused Jacobins were tried by military courts between 19 September and 27 October. Thirty Jacobins, including three former deputies of the Convention, were convicted and guillotined. Babeuf and his principal followers were tried in Vendôme between 20 February and 26 May 1797. The two principal leaders, Babeuf and Augustin Alexandre Darthé, were convicted. They both attempted suicide, but failed and were guillotined on 27 May 1797. However, in the following months, the Directory and Councils gradually turned away from the royalist right and tried to find new allies on the left.

=== War and Diplomacy (1796–1797) ===
The major preoccupation of the Directory during its existence was the war against the coalition of Britain and Austria. The military objective set by the Convention in October 1795 was to enlarge France to what were declared its natural limits: the Pyrenees, the Rhine and the Alps, the borders of Gaul at the time of the Roman Empire. In 1795, Prussia, Spain and the Dutch Republic quit the War of the First Coalition and made peace with France, but Great Britain refused to accept the French annexation of the Austrian Netherlands. Beside Britain and Austria, the only enemies remaining for France were the Kingdom of Sardinia and several small Italian states. Austria proposed a European congress to settle borders, but the Directory refused, demanding direct negotiations with Austria instead. Under British pressure, Austria agreed to continue the war against France.

Lazare Carnot, the Director who oversaw military affairs, planned a new campaign against Austria, using three armies: General Jean-Baptiste Jourdan&#x27;s Army of Sambre-et-Meuse on the Rhine and General Jean Victor Moreau&#x27;s Army of the Rhine and Moselle on the Danube would march to Vienna and dictate a peace. A third army, the Army of Italy under General Bonaparte, who had risen in rank with spectacular speed due to his defense of the government from a royalist uprising, would carry out a diversionary operation against Austria in northern Italy. Jourdan&#x27;s army captured Mayence and Frankfurt, but on 14 August 1796 was defeated by the Austrians at the Battle of Amberg and again on 3 September 1796 at the Battle of Würzburg, and had to retreat back to the Rhine. General Moreau, without the support of Jourdan, was also forced to retreat.

==== Italian campaign ====

The story was very different in Italy. Bonaparte, though he was only twenty-eight years old, was named commander of the Army of Italy on 2 March 1796, through the influence of Barras, his patron in the Directory. Bonaparte faced the combined armies of Austria and Sardinia, which numbered seventy thousand men. Bonaparte slipped his army between them and defeated them in a series of battles, culminating at the Battle of Mondovi where he defeated the Sardinians on 22 April 1796, and the Battle of Lodi, where he defeated the Austrians on 10 May. King Victor Amadeus III of Sardinia was forced to make peace in May 1796 and ceded Nice and Savoy to France.

At the end of 1796, Austria sent two new armies to Italy to expel Bonaparte, but Bonaparte outmaneuvered them both, winning a first victory at the Battle of Arcole on 17 November 1796, then at the Battle of Rivoli on 14 January 1797. He forced Austria to sign the Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797), whereby Emperor Francis II ceded Lombardy and the Austrian Netherlands to the French Republic in exchange for Venice and urged the Imperial Diet to surrender the lands beyond the Rhine.

==== Spanish alliance ====
The Directory was eager to form a coalition with Spain to block British commerce with the continent and to close the Mediterranean Sea to British ships. By the Second Treaty of San Ildefonso, concluded in August 1796, Spain became the ally of France, and on 5 October, it declared war on Britain. The British fleet under Admiral Jervis defeated the Spanish fleet at the Cape St Vincent, keeping the Mediterranean open to British ships, but Britain was brought into such extreme peril by the Spithead and Nore mutinies in its fleet that it offered to acknowledge the French conquest of the Netherlands and to restore captured French colonies in the Caribbean and India.

==== Irish Misadventure ====

The Directory also sought a new way to strike British interests and to repay Britain for the support it gave to royalist insurgents in Brittany. A French fleet of 44 vessels departed Brest on 15 December 1796, carrying an expeditionary force of 14,000 soldiers, led by General Hoche to Ireland, where they hoped to join forces with Irish rebels to expel the British from the Kingdom of Ireland. However, the fleet was separated by storms off the Irish coast and, being unable to land in Ireland, had to return to home port with 31 vessels and 12,000 surviving soldiers.

=== Rise of the royalists and coup d&#x27;état (1797) ===

The first elections held after the formation of the Directory were held in March and April 1797, in order to replace one-third of the members of the Councils. The elections were a crushing defeat for the old members of the Convention; 205 of the 216 were defeated. Only eleven former deputies from the Convention were reelected, several of whom were royalists. The elections were a triumph for the royalists, particularly in the south and in the west; after the elections there were about 160 royalist deputies, divided between those who favored a return to an absolute monarchy, and those who wished a constitutional monarchy on the British model. The constitutional monarchists elected to the Council included Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours, who later emigrated to the United States with his family, and whose son, Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, founded the &quot;E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company&quot;, now known as DuPont. In Paris and other large cities, the candidates of the left dominated. General Jean-Charles Pichegru, a former Jacobin and ordinary soldier who had become one of the most successful generals of the Revolution, was elected president of the new Council of Five Hundred. François Barbé-Marbois, a diplomat and future negotiator of the sale of Louisiana to the United States, was elected president of the Council of Ancients.
Royalism was not strictly legal, and deputies could not announce themselves as such, but royalist newspapers and pamphlets soon appeared, there were pro-monarchy demonstrations in theaters, and royalists wore identifying clothing items, such as black velvet collars, in show of mourning for the execution of Louis XVI. The parliamentary royalists demanded changes in the government fiscal policies, and a more tolerant position toward religion. During the Convention, churches had been closed and priests required to take an oath to the government. Priests who had refused to take the oath were expelled from the country, on pain of the death penalty if they returned. Under the Directory, many priests had quietly returned, and many churches around the country had re-opened and were discreetly holding services. When the Directory proposed moving the ashes of the celebrated mathematician and philosopher René Descartes to the &quot;Panthéon&quot;, one deputy, Louis-Sébastien Mercier, a former Girondin and opponent of the Jacobins, protested that the ideas of Descartes had inspired the Reign of Terror of the Revolution and destroyed religion in France. Descartes&#x27; ashes were not moved. &quot;Émigrés&quot; who had left during the Revolution had been threatened by the Convention with the death penalty if they returned; now, under the Directory, they quietly began to return.

Parallel with the parliamentary royalists, but not directly connected with them, a clandestine network of royalists existed, whose objective was to place Louis XVIII, then in exile in Germany, on the French throne. They were funded largely by Britain, through the offices of William Wickham, the British spymaster who had his headquarters in Switzerland. These networks were too divided and too closely watched by the police to have much effect on politics. However, Wickham did make one contact that proved to have a decisive effect on French politics: through an intermediary, he had held negotiations with General Pichegru, then commander of the Army of the Rhine.

The Directory itself was divided. Carnot, Letourneur and La Révellière Lépeaux were not royalists, but favored a more moderate government, more tolerant of religion. Though Carnot himself had been a member of the Committee of Public Safety, he declared that the Jacobins were ungovernable, that the Revolution could not go on forever, and that it was time to end it. A new member, François-Marie, marquis de Barthélemy, a diplomat, had joined the Directory; he was allied with Carnot. The royalists in the Councils immediately began to demand more power over the government and particularly over the finances, threatening the position of Barras.

Barras, the consummate intriguer, won La Révellière Lépeaux over to his side, and began planning the downfall of the royalists. From letters taken from a captured royalist agent, he was aware of the contacts that General Pichegru made with the British and that he had been in contact with the exiled Louis XVIII. He presented this information to Carnot, and Carnot agreed to support his action against the Councils. General Hoche, the new Minister of War, was directed to march the Army of Sambre-et-Meuse through Paris on its way to Brest, on the pretext that they would be embarked for a new expedition to Ireland. Hoche himself resigned as Minister of War on 22 July. General Pierre Augereau, a close subordinate and ally of Bonaparte, and his troops arrived in Paris on 7 August, though it was a violation of the Constitution for soldiers to be within twelve leagues of the city without permission of the Councils. The royalist members of the Councils protested, but could do nothing to send them away.

On 4 September 1797, with the army in place, the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état&quot; of 18 Fructidor, Year V was set in motion. General Augereau&#x27;s soldiers arrested Pichegru, Barthélemy, and the leading royalist deputies of the Councils. The next day, the Directory annulled the elections of about two hundred deputies in 53 departments. Sixty-five deputies were deported to Guiana, 42 royalist newspapers were closed, and 65 journalists and editors were deported. Carnot and Barthélemy were removed from the Directory. Carnot went into exile in Switzerland; he later returned and became, for a time, Bonaparte&#x27;s minister of war. Barthélemy and Pichegru both were sent to exile in French Guiana (Devil&#x27;s Island). In June 1798, they both escaped, and went first to the United States and then to England. During the Consulate, Pichegru returned secretly to Paris, where he was captured on 28 February 1804. He died in prison on 6 April 1804, either strangled or having committed suicide.

=== Second Directory and resurgence of the Jacobins ===
The coup was followed by a scattering of uprisings by royalists in Aix-en-Provence, Tarascon and other towns, particularly in the southwest and west. A commissioner of the Directory was assassinated in Lyon, and on 22 October counter-revolutionaries seized the city government of Carpentras for twenty-four hours. These brief uprisings served only to justify a wave of repression from the new government.

With Carnot and Barthélemy gone from the Directory, and the royalists expelled from the Councils, the Jacobins were once again in control of the government. The two vacant places in the Directory were filled by Merlin de Douai, a lawyer who had helped write the Law of Suspects during the Reign of Terror; and François de Neufchâteau, a poet and expert in industry inland navigation, who served only a few months. Eight of the twelve Directors and ministers of the new government were regicides, who as deputies of the Convention had voted for the execution of Louis XVI, and were now determined to continue the Revolution.

The central administration and city governments were quickly purged of suspected royalists. The next target was the wave of noble &quot;émigrés&quot; and priests who had begun to return to France. The Jacobins in the Councils demanded that the law of 1793 be enforced; &quot;émigrés&quot; were ordered to leave France within fifteen days. If they did not, they were to be judged by a military commission, and, on simple proof of their identity, were to be executed within twenty-four hours. Military commissions were established throughout the country to judge not only returning &quot;émigrés&quot;, but also rebels and conspirators. Between 4 September 1797 and the end of the Directory in 1799, 160 persons were condemned to death by the military tribunals, including 41 priests and several women.

On 16 October 1797, the Council of Five Hundred considered a new law which banned political activities by nobles, who were to be considered as foreigners, and had to apply for naturalization in order to take part in politics. A certain number, listed by names, were to be banned permanently from political activity, were to have their property confiscated, and were to be required to leave immediately. The law called for certain exemptions for those in the government and military (Director Barras and General Bonaparte were both from minor noble families). In the end, resistance to the law was so great that it was not adopted.

The Jacobin-dominated councils also demanded the deportation of priests who refused to take an oath to the government, and an oath declaring their hatred of royalty and anarchy. 267 priests were deported to the French penal colony of Cayenne in French Guiana, of whom 111 survived and returned to France. 920 were sent to a prison colony on the Île de Ré, and 120, a large part of them Belgians, to another colony on the Île d&#x27;Oléron. The new government continued the anti-religious policy of the Convention. Several churches, including the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris and the church of Saint-Sulpice, were converted into Theophilanthropic temples, a new religion based on the belief in the existence of God and the immortality of the human spirit. Religious observations were forbidden on Sunday; they were allowed only on the last day of the 10-day week (&quot;décade&quot;) of the French Republican Calendar. Other churches remained closed, and were forbidden to ring their bells, although many religious services took place in secret in private homes. The National Guard was mobilized to search rural areas and forests for priests and nobles in hiding. As during the Reign of Terror, lists were prepared of suspects, who would be arrested in the event of attempted uprisings.

The new Jacobin-dominated Directory and government also targeted the press. Newspaper publishers were required to submit copies of their publications to the police for official approval. On 17 December 1797, seventeen Paris newspapers were closed by order of the Directory. The Directory also imposed a substantial tax on all newspapers or magazines distributed by mail, although Jacobin publications, as well as scientific and art publications, were excluded. Books critical of the Jacobins were censored; Louis-Marie Prudhomme&#x27;s six-volume &quot;Histoire générale et impartiale des erreurs, des fautes et des crimes commis pendant la Révolution française&quot; (&quot;General and impartial history of the errors, faults and crimes committed during the French Revolution&quot;) was seized by the police. The Directory also authorized the opening and reading of letters coming from outside of France.
Despite all these security measures, there was a great increase in brigandage and robbery in the French countryside; travelers were frequently stopped on roads and robbed; the robberies were often blamed on royalist bands. On 18 January 1798, the Councils passed a new law against highwaymen and bandits, calling for them to be tried by military tribunals, and authorizing the death penalty for robbery or attempted robbery on the roads of France.

The political repression and terror under the Directory were real, but they were on a much smaller scale than the Reign of Terror under Robespierre and the Convention, and the numbers of those repressed declined during the course of the Directory. After 1798, no further political prisoners were sent to French Guiana, and, in the final year of the Directory, only one person was executed for a political offense.

=== Elections of 1798 ===

In the spring of 1798, not only a new third of the legislature had to be chosen, but the places of the members expelled by the revolution of had to be filled. 437 seats were open, out of 750. The elections took place between 9 and 18 April. The royalists had been disqualified, and the moderates were in disarray, while the radical Jacobins made a strong showing. Before the new deputies could take their seats, Barras and the other Directors, more moderate than the new Jacobins, organized a commission to review the elections, and disqualified many of the more extreme Jacobin candidates (&quot;Law of 22 Floréal Year VI&quot;), replacing them with moderates. They sent the list of candidates for Director to the Councils, excluding any radicals. François de Neufchåteau was chosen by a drawing of lots to leave the Directory and Barras proposed only moderate Jacobins to replace him: the choice fell on Jean-Baptiste Treilhard, a lawyer. These political maneuvers secured the power of the Directory, but widened further the gap between the moderate Directory and the radical Jacobin majority in the Councils.

=== War and diplomacy (1798) ===
On 17 October 1797, General Bonaparte and the Austrians signed the Treaty of Campoformio. It was a triumph for France. France received the left bank of the Rhine as far south as Cologne, Belgium, and the Ionian Islands that had belonged to the Republic of Venice. Austria in compensation was given the Veneto and the former Venetian Dalmatia. In late November and December, Napoleon took part in negotiations with the Holy Roman Empire and Austria, at the Second Congress of Rastatt, to redraw the borders of Germany. He was then summoned back to Paris to take charge of an even more ambitious project, the invasion of Britain, which had been proposed by Director Carnot and General Hoche. But an eight-day inspection of the ports where the invasion fleet was being prepared convinced Bonaparte that the invasion had little chance of success: the ships were in poor condition, the crews poorly trained, and funds and logistics were lacking. He privately told his associate Marmont his view of the Directory: &quot;Nothing can be done with these people. They don&#x27;t understand anything of greatness. We need to go back to our projects for the East. It is only there that great results can be achieved.&quot; The invasion of England was cancelled, and a less ambitious plan to support an Irish uprising was proposed instead (see below).

==== Sister Republics ====

The grand plan of the Directory in 1798, with the assistance of its armies, was the creation of &quot;Sister Republics&quot; in Europe which would share the same revolutionary values and same goals, and would be natural allies of France. In the Dutch Republic (Republic of the Seven United Netherlands), the French army installed the Batavian Republic with the same system of a Directory and two elected Councils. In Milan, the Cisalpine Republic was created, which was governed jointly by a Directory and Councils and by the French army. General Louis-Alexandre Berthier, who had replaced Bonaparte as the commander of the Army of Italy, imitated the actions of the Directory in Paris, purging the new republic&#x27;s legislature of members whom he considered too radical. The Ligurian Republic was formed in Genoa. Piedmont was also turned by the French army into a sister republic, the Piedmontese Republic. In Turin, King Charles-Emmanuel IV, (whose wife, Clotilde, was Louis XVI&#x27;s youngest sister), fled French dominance and sailed, protected by the British fleet, to Sardinia. In Savoy, General Barthélemy Catherine Joubert did not bother to form a sister republic, he simply made the province a department of France.

The Directory also directly attacked the authority of Pope Pius VI, who governed Rome and the Papal States surrounding it. Shortly after Christmas on 28 December 1797, anti-French riots took place in Rome, and a French Army brigadier general, Mathurin-Léonard Duphot, was assassinated. Pope Pius VI moved quickly and formally apologized to the Directory on 29 December 1797, but the Directory refused his apology. Instead, Berthier&#x27;s troops entered Rome and occupied the city on 10 February 1798. Thus the Roman Republic was also proclaimed on 10 February 1798. Pius VI was arrested and confined in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany before being taken to France in 1799. The Vatican treasury of thirty million francs was sent to Paris, where it helped finance Bonaparte&#x27;s expedition to Egypt, and five hundred cases of paintings, statues, and other art objects were sent to France and added to the collections of the Louvre.

A French army under General Guillaume Brune occupied much of Switzerland. The Helvetic Republic was proclaimed on 12 April 1798. On 26 August 1798, Geneva was detached from the new republic and made part of France. The treasury of Bern was seized, and, like the treasury of the Vatican, was used to finance Bonaparte&#x27;s expedition to Egypt.

The new military campaigns required thousands of additional soldiers. The Directory approved the first permanent law of conscription, which was unpopular in the countryside, and particularly in Belgium, which had formally become part of France. Riots and peasant uprisings took place in the Belgian countryside. Blaming the unrest on Belgian priests, French authorities ordered the arrest and deportation of several thousands of them.

==== Bonaparte&#x27;s expedition to Egypt (May 1798) ====

The idea of a French military expedition to Egypt had been proposed by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord in a memoir to the Institut de France as early as 3 July 1797, and in a letter the following month from Talleyrand to Bonaparte. The Egyptian expedition had three objectives: to cut the shortest route from England to British India by occupying the Isthmus of Suez; to found a colony which could produce cotton and sugar cane, which were in short supply in France due to the British blockade; and to provide a base for a future French attack on British India. It also had several personal advantages for Bonaparte: it allowed him to keep a distance from the unpopular Directory, while at the same time staying in the public eye.
The Directory itself was not enthusiastic about the idea, which would take its most successful general and his army far from Europe just at the time that a major new war was brewing. Director La Révellière-Lépeaux wrote: &quot;The idea never came from the Directory or any of its members. The ambition and pride of Bonaparte could no longer support the idea of not being visible, and of being under the orders of the Directory.&quot;

The idea presented two other problems: Republican French policy was opposed to colonization, and France was not at war with the Ottoman Empire, to which Egypt belonged. Therefore, the expedition was given an additional scientific purpose: &quot;to enlighten the world and to obtain new treasures for science.&quot; A large team of prominent scientists was added to the expedition; twenty-one mathematicians, three astronomers, four architects, thirteen naturalists and an equal number of geographers, plus painters, a pianist and the poet François-Auguste Parseval-Grandmaison.

On 19 May 1798, two hundred ships carrying Bonaparte, and 35,000 men comprising the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Orient&quot;, most of them veterans of Bonaparte&#x27;s Army of Italy, sailed from Toulon. The British fleet under Nelson, expecting a French expedition toward Constantinople, was not in position to stop them. The French fleet stopped briefly at Malta, capturing the island, the government of which offered little resistance. Bonaparte&#x27;s army landed in the bay of Alexandria on 1 July, and captured that city on 2 July, with little opposition. He wrote a letter to the Pasha of Egypt, claiming that his purpose was to liberate Egypt from the tyranny of the Mamluks. His army marched across the desert, despite extreme heat, and defeated the Mamluks at the Battle of the Pyramids on 21 July 1798. A few days later, however, on 1 August, the British fleet under Admiral Nelson arrived off the coast; the French fleet was taken by surprise and destroyed in the Battle of the Nile. Only four French ships escaped. Bonaparte and his army were prisoners in Egypt.

==== Failed uprising in Ireland (August 1798) ====

Another attempt to support an Irish uprising was made on 7 August 1798. A French fleet sailed from Rochefort-sur-Mer (Rochefort) carrying an expeditionary force led by General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert. The attack was intended to support an uprising of Irish nationalists led by Wolfe Tone. Tone had several meetings with Bonaparte in France to coordinate the timing, but the uprising within the Kingdom of Ireland began early and was suppressed on 14 July 1798 before the French fleet arrived. The French force landed at Killala, in northwest Ireland, on 22 August. It defeated British troops in two small engagements on 24 and 27 August, and Humbert declared the formation of an Irish Republic at Castlebar on 27 August, but the French forces were defeated at the Battle of Ballinamuck on 8 September 1798 by the troops of Lord Cornwallis, British Commander-in-Chief, Ireland. A second part of the French expeditionary force, not knowing that the first had surrendered, left Brest on 16 September. It was intercepted by the Royal Navy in the bay of Donegal, and six of the French warships were captured.

==== Quasi-War with the United States (1798–1799) ====

Tensions between the United States and France developed into the Quasi-War, an undeclared naval war. France complained the United States was ignoring the 1778 Treaty of Alliance that had brought the French into the American Revolutionary War. The United States insisted on taking a neutral stance in the war between France and Britain. After the Jay Treaty with Britain went into effect in 1795, France began to side against the United States and by 1797 had seized over 300 American merchant ships. Federalists favored Britain while Jeffersonian Republicans favored France. Federalist President John Adams built up the United States Navy, finishing three frigates, approving funds to build three more and sending diplomats to Paris to negotiate. They were insulted by Foreign Minister Talleyrand (who demanded bribes before talking). The XYZ Affair told Americans about the negotiations and angered American public opinion. The war was fought almost entirely at sea, mostly between privateers and merchant ships. In 1800, the Convention of 1800 (Treaty of Mortefontaine) ended the conflict.

=== War and political crisis (1799) ===
==== Second Coalition against France ====
Britain and Austria had been alarmed by the French creation of Sister Republics. Austria first demanded that France hand over a share of the territory of the new Republics to it. When the Directory refused, Austria began searching for partners for a new military alliance against France. The new Tsar of Russia, Paul I, was extremely hostile to French republican ideas, sympathetic to the exiled Louis XVIII, and willing to join a new coalition against France. The Tsar offered an army of 20,000 men, sent by sea to Holland on his Baltic fleet. He sent another army of 60,000 men, veterans of fighting in Poland and Turkey, under his best general, Alexander Suvorov, to join the Austrian forces in northern Italy.

The King of Prussia, Frederick-William III, had carefully preserved neutrality in order to profit from both sides. The Directory made the error of sending one of the most prominent revolutionaries of 1789, the Abbé Sieyés, who had voted for the death of Louis XVI, as ambassador to Berlin, where his ideas appalled the arch-conservative and ultra-monarchist king. Frederick William maintained his neutrality, refusing to support either side, a setback for France.

By the end of 1798, the coalition could count on 300,000 soldiers, and would be able to increase the number to 600,000. The best French army, headed by Bonaparte, was stranded in Egypt. General Brune had 12,000 men in Holland; Bernadotte, 10,000 men on the Rhine; Jourdan, 40,000 men in the army of the Danube; Masséna, 30,000 soldiers in Switzerland; Scherer, 40,000 men on the Adige river in northern Italy; and 27,000 men under Macdonald were based in Naples: a total of 170,000 men. To try to match the coalition forces, the Directory ordered a new call up of young men between the ages of twenty and twenty five to the army, seeking to add two hundred thousand new soldiers.

==== Resurgence of the War in Italy and Switzerland ====
On 10 November 1798, the British and Austrian governments had agreed on a common goal of suppressing the five new sister republics and forcing France back into its 1789 borders. Then on 29 November 1798, on the first day of the War of the Second Coalition, King Ferdinand of Naples launched an attack on Rome, which was lightly defended by French soldiers. A British fleet landed three thousand Neapolitan soldiers in Tuscany. However, the French army of General Championnet responded quickly, defeating the Neapolitan army at the Battle of Civita Castellana at Civita Castellana on 5 December. The next day, 6 December 1798, French soldiers also forced King Charles Emmanuel IV to remove his soldiers from Piedmont and to retreat to his island of Sardinia, his last possession. The French army marched to the Kingdom of Naples, obliging King Ferdinand to leave his City of Naples on a British warship on 23 December 1798. Naples was then occupied on 23 January 1799, and a new Neapolitan republic, the so-called Parthenopean Republic, the sixth under French protection, was proclaimed on 26 January.

Peace negotiations with Austria went nowhere in the spring of 1799, and the Directory decided to launch a new offensive into Germany, but the arrival of a Russian army under Alexander Suvorov and fresh Austrian forces under the Archduke Charles for a time changed the balance of power. Jourdan&#x27;s Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine on 6 March but was defeated by the Archduke Charles, first at the Battle of Ostrach and then at the Battle of Stockach on 25 March 1799. Jourdan&#x27;s army withdrew while Jourdan himself returned to Paris to plea for more soldiers.

The forces of the Second Coalition invaded French-occupied Italy, and after five earlier battles, a joint Russian-Austrian army under Suvorov&#x27;s command defeated Moreau at the Battle of Cassano on 27 April 1799 and thus occupied Turin and Milan and thereby took back the Cisalpine Republic from France. Suvorov then defeated the French Army on the Terrivva. To redress the situation, Joubert was named the new head of the Army of Italy on 5 July, but his army suffered defeat by the Russians at the Battle of Novi, on 15 August; Joubert himself was shot through the heart when the battle began, and his army was routed. The Sister Republics established by the French in Italy quickly collapsed, leaving only Genoa under French control.

In August, the Russians and British opened a new front in the Netherlands. A British army was landed at Den Helder on 27 August, and was joined by a Russian army. On 31 August, the Batavian Navy, allied with France, surrendered to the Royal Navy. Seeing the French army and government in a crisis, the leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vendée and Brittany came together on 15 September to prepare a renewed uprising.

The surviving leaders of the royalist rebellions in the Vendée and Brittany, which had long been dormant, saw a new opportunity for success and met to plan strategy on 15 September 1799. The royalist commander Louis de Frotté, in exile in England, returned to France to command the new uprising.

==== Bonaparte&#x27;s Campaign in Syria (February–May 1799) ====
While the French armies in Italy and Switzerland tried to preserve the Sister Republics, Bonaparte pursued his own campaign in Egypt. He explained in a letter to the Directory that Egyptian venture was just the beginning of a broader campaign &quot;to create a formidable diversion in the campaign of Republican France versus monarchic Europe. Egypt would be the base of something much larger than the original project, and at the same time a lever which will aid in the creation of a general uprising of the Muslim world.&quot; This uprising, he believed, would lead to the collapse of British power from the Middle East to India. With this goal in mind, he left Cairo and marched his army across the Sinai desert into Syria, where he laid siege to the port of Saint-Jean-d&#x27;Acre of the Ottoman Empire, which was defended by a local army and supplied by a British fleet offshore. His long siege and attempts to storm the city were a failure; his army was ravaged by disease, it was down to 11,000 men, and he learned that an Ottoman army was to be embarked by the British fleet to sail to Cairo to recapture the city. On 17 May, he abandoned the siege and was back in Cairo by 4 June. The British fleet landed the Ottoman army, but as soon as they were ashore they were decisively defeated by Bonaparte at the Battle of Abukir on 25 July 1799.

Due to the British blockade of Egypt, Bonaparte had received no news from France for six months. He sent one of his military aides to meet with Turkish government officials and to try to get news from France, but the officer was intercepted by the British navy. The British admiral and naval commander in the eastern Mediterranean, Sir Sidney Smith, who had lived in Paris and knew France well, gave the officer a packet of recent French newspapers and sent him back to Bonaparte. Bonaparte spent the night reading the newspapers, learning about the political and military troubles in France. His orders permitted him to return home any time he chose. The next day he decided to return to France immediately. He handed over command of the army to General Kléber and left Egypt with a small party of senior officers aboard the frigate &quot;Muiron&quot;. He escaped the British blockade but did not reach France until 9 October.

==== Tide turns: French successes (September 1799) ====

The military position of France, which seemed disastrous during the summer, improved greatly in September. On 19 September, General Brune won a victory over the British-Russian army in the Netherlands at Castricum. On 18 October, besieged by Brune at Alkmaar, the British-Russian forces under the Duke of York agreed to withdraw. In Switzerland, a Russian Army had split into two. On 25–26 September, the French army in Switzerland, led by André Masséna, defeated one part of the Russian army under Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov at the Second Battle of Zurich, and forced the rest of the Russian army, under Suvorov, into disastrous retreat across the Alps to &#x27;Italy&#x27;. Suvorov was furious at the Austrians, blaming them for not supporting his troops, and he urged the Tsar to withdraw his forces from the war.
The royalist uprising in the west of France, planned to accompany the British-Russian-Austrian offensive, was also a failure. The Chouans briefly seized Le Mans on 14 October and Nantes on 19 October, but they were quickly driven out by the French Army, and the rebellion had collapsed by 29 October.

=== New economic crisis ===
Since the beginning of the Revolution, the nation suffered from rampant inflation. By the time of the Directory, the paper money, the &quot;assignat&quot;, based on the value of goods confiscated from the church and nobility, had already lost most of its value. Prices had soared, and the government could not print money fast enough to meet its expenses. The value of the assignat had dropped drastically against the value of the livre, the main unit of currency of the old regime which contained silver. In 1790, at the beginning of the Revolution, an assignat with a face value of 1,000₶. could be exchanged for 900 silver livres. In January 1795, The Convention decided to issue assignats worth 30 billion-₶., without any additional backing by gold. By March 1795, an assignat with a value of 1,000₶. could buy only 80 silver livres. In February 1796, the Directory decided to abolish the assignat, and held a public ceremony to destroy the printing plates. The assignat was replaced by a new note, the &quot;Mandats territoriaux&quot;. But since this new paper money also lacked any substantial backing, its value also plummeted; by February 1797 the &quot;Mandat&quot; was worth only one percent of its original value. The Directory decided to return to the use of gold or silver coins, which kept their value. 100₶. of Mandats was exchanged for 1 silver livre. The difficulty was that the Directory had only enough gold and silver to produce 300 million-₶.. The result of the shortage of money in circulation was a drastic deflation and drop in prices, which was accompanied by a drop in investment, and a drop in wages. It led to a drop in economic activity, and unemployment.

=== New elections, new Directors and a growing political crisis ===
New elections to elect 315 members of the Councils were held between 21 March – 9 April 1799. The royalists had been discredited and were gone; the major winners were the neo-Jacobins, who wanted to continue and strengthen the Revolution. The new members of the Council included Lucien Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon, just twenty-four years old. On the strength of his name, he was elected the President of the Council of Five Hundred.

This time the Directors did not try to disqualify the Jacobins but looked for other ways to keep control of the government. It was time to elect a new member of the Directory, as Rewbell had been designated by the drawing of lots to step down. Under the Constitution, the selection of a new member of the Directory was voted by the old members of the Councils, not the newly elected ones. The candidate selected to replace him was the Abbé Sieyés, one of the major leaders of the revolution in 1789, who had been serving as Ambassador to Berlin. Sieyés had his own project in mind: He had devised a new doctrine that the power of government should be limited in order to protect the rights of the citizens. His idea was to adopt a new Constitution with a supreme court, on the American model, to protect individual rights. He privately saw his primary mission as preventing a return of Reign of Terror of 1793, a new constitution, and bringing the Revolution to a close as soon as possible, by whatever means.

Once the elections were complete, the Jacobin majority immediately demanded that the Directory be made more revolutionary. The Councils began meeting on 20 May, and on 5 June they began their offensive to turn the Directors to the left. They declared the election of the Director Treilhard illegal on technical grounds and voted to replace him with Louis-Jérôme Gohier, a lawyer who had been Minister of Justice during the Convention, and who had overseen the arrest of the moderate Girondin deputies. The Jacobins in the Council then went a step further and demanded the resignation of two moderate Directors, La Revelliere and Merlin. They were replaced by two new members, Roger Ducos, a little-known lawyer who had been a member of the Committee of Public Safety, and was an ally of Barras, and an obscure Jacobin general, Jean-François-Auguste Moulin. The new Ministers named by the Directors were for the most part reliable Jacobins, though Sieyés arranged the appointment of one of his allies, Joseph Fouché, as the new Minister of Police.

The Jacobin members immediately began proposing laws that were largely favorable to the sans-culottes and working class, but which alarmed the upper and middle classes. The Councils imposed a forced loan of one hundred million francs, to be paid immediately according to a graduated scale by all who paid a property tax of over three hundred francs. Those who did not pay would be classified the same as émigré nobles and would lose all civil rights. The Councils also passed a new law that called for making hostages of the fathers, mothers and grandparents of émigré nobles whose children had emigrated or were serving in rebel bands or armies. These hostages were subject to large fines or deportation in the event of assassinations or property damage caused by royalist soldiers or bandits. On 27 June General Jourdan, a prominent Jacobin member of the Councils, proposed a mass draft of all eligible young men between twenty and twenty-five to raise two hundred thousand new soldiers for the army. This would be the first draft since 1793.

The new Jacobins opened a new political club, the Club du Manège, on the model of Jacobin clubs of the Convention. It opened on 6 July and soon had three thousand members, with 250 deputies, including many alumni of the Jacobins during the Reign of Terror, as well as former supporters of the ultra-revolutionary François Babeuf. One prominent member, General Jourdan, greeted the members at the club&#x27;s banquet of 14 July with the toast, &quot;to a return of the pikes&#x27;&quot;, referring to the weapons used by the sans-culottes to parade the heads of executed nobles. The club members also were not afraid to attack the Directory itself, complaining of its lavish furnishings and the luxurious coaches used by Directory members. The Directory soon responded to the provocations; Sieyés denounced the club members as a return of Robespierre&#x27;s reign of terror. The Minister of Police, Fouché, closed the Club on 13 August.

=== Bonaparte returns to France, coup d&#x27;état and the end of the Directory ===
==== Preparing the coup d&#x27;état ====

The rule that Directors must to be at least forty years old became one justification for the Coup of 18 Brumaire: the coup d&#x27;état took place on 9 November 1799, when Bonaparte was thirty years old. Bonaparte returned to France, landing at the fishing village of Saint-Raphaël on 9 October 1799, and made a triumphal progression northward to Paris. His victory over the Ottoman Turks at the Battle of Abukir had been widely reported, and overshadowed the other French victories at the Second Battle of Zurich and the Battle of Bergen. Between Avignon and Paris, he was welcomed by large, enthusiastic crowds, who saw him as a saviour of the Republic from foreign enemies and the corruption of the Directory. Upon his arrival in Paris he was elected to the for the scientific accomplishments of his expedition to Egypt. He was welcomed by royalists because he was from a minor noble family in Corsica, and by the Jacobins because he had suppressed the attempted royalist &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; at the beginning of the Directory. His brother Lucien, though only twenty-four years old, became a prominent figure in the Council of Five Hundred because of his name.

Bonaparte&#x27;s first ambition was to be appointed to the Directory, but he was not yet forty years old, the minimum age set by the Constitution, and the Director Gohier, a strict legalist, blocked that avenue. His earliest ally had been the Director Barras, but he disliked Barras because his wife Joséphine had been his mistress before she married Bonaparte, and because of charges of corruption that surrounded Barras and his allies. Bonaparte wrote later that the Jacobin director, General Jean-François-Auguste Moulin, approached Bonaparte and suggested that he lead a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, but he declined; he wished to end the Revolution, not continue it. Sieyés, who had been looking for a war hero and general to assist in a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;, had originally in mind General Joubert, but Joubert had been killed at the Battle of Novi in August 1799. He then approached General Jean Victor Marie Moreau, but Moreau was not interested. The first meeting between Sieyés and Bonaparte, on 23 October 1799, went badly; the two men each had enormous egos and instantly disliked each other. Nonetheless, they had a strong common interest and, on 6 November 1799, they formalized their plan.

The &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; was carefully planned by Sieyès and Bonaparte, with the assistance of Bonaparte&#x27;s brother Lucien, the diplomat and consummate intriguer Talleyrand, the Minister of Police Fouché, and the Commissioner of the Directory, Pierre François Réal. The plan called for three Directors to suddenly resign, leaving the country without an Executive. The Councils would then be told that a Jacobin conspiracy threatened the Nation; the Councils would be moved for their own security to the Château de Saint-Cloud, some west of Paris, safe from the mobs of the French capital. Bonaparte would be named head of government to defend the Republic against the conspiracy; the Councils would be dissolved, and a new Constitution would be written. If the coup went well, it was simply a parliamentary maneuver; it would be perfectly legal. Bonaparte would provide security and take the part of convincing the Deputies. Fouché and Réal would assure that there would be no interference from the police or the city of Paris. Fouché proposed that the leading Jacobin deputies be arrested at the start of the coup, but Bonaparte said it would not be necessary, which later proved to be an error. Shortly before the coup, Bonaparte met with the principal army commanders: Jourdan, Bernadotte, Augereau and Moreau, and informed them of the impending coup. They did not all support it, but agreed not to stand in his way. The president of the Council of Ancients was also brought into the coup, so he could play his part, and Bonaparte&#x27;s brother Lucien would manage the Council of Five Hundred. On the evening of 6 November, the Councils held a banquet at the former church of Saint-Sulpice. Bonaparte attended, but seemed cold and distracted, and departed early.

==== Coup d&#x27;état is launched (9–10 November)====

Early in the morning of 9 November, army units began taking positions in Paris, and the members of the Council of Ancients were awakened and instructed to come to the Tuileries Palace for an emergency meeting. When they gathered at seven-thirty, they were told that a Jacobin conspiracy to overthrow the government had been discovered and that they should transfer their meeting the next day to the &quot;Château de Saint-Cloud&quot;, where they would be in safety. The members were asked to approve a decree to move the meeting site, and to appoint Bonaparte as commander of troops in Paris to assure their security. Alarmed, they quickly approved the decree. Bonaparte himself appeared with his staff and told them, &quot;Citizen representatives, the Republic was about to perish. You learned of it and your decree has just saved it&quot;. At eleven in the morning, the members of the Council of Five Hundred met at the Palais Bourbon and were given the same message. They agreed to move their meeting the following day to Saint-Cloud.

As planned, by the afternoon Sieyés and Roger Ducos had given their resignations. Talleyrand was assigned to win the resignation of Barras. Talleyrand was supplied with a large amount of money to offer Barras to quit; historians differ on whether he gave the money to Barras or kept it for himself. Barras, seeing the movements of soldiers outside and being assured that he could keep the great wealth he had acquired as a Director, readily agreed to leave the Directory. With three members gone, the Directory could not legally meet. The Jacobin directors Moulin and Gohier were arrested and confined to the Luxembourg Palace under the guard of General Moreau. The first day of the coup had gone exactly as planned.
On 10 November, the members of both councils were taken in a procession of carriages with a strong military escort to Saint-Cloud. 6,000 soldiers had already been assembled at the château; because their pay had repeatedly been delayed, they were particularly hostile to the members of the Chambers. Bonaparte spoke first to the Council of the Ancients, assembled in the &quot;Orangerie&quot; of the domain of Saint-Cloud, and explained that the Directory was no more. Bonaparte was received coldly, but the Council did not offer any opposition. He then moved to the Council of Five Hundred, which was already meeting under the presidency of his brother Lucien. Here he received a far more hostile reception from the Jacobin deputies. He was questioned, jeered, insulted, shouted down, and jostled. His brother was unable to restore calm, and some of the Jacobin deputies began to demand that Bonaparte be declared outside the law, as Robespierre had been. If the Council voted him outside the law, Bonaparte could be arrested and executed immediately without trial. While the deputies raged and argued, Bonaparte and his brother, escorted by a handful of soldiers, left the &quot;Orangerie&quot;, approached the unit of grenadiers of General Joachim Murat waiting impatiently outside, and told them that the deputies had tried to assassinate Bonaparte with their pens. The grenadiers charged into the hall and quickly emptied it of deputies.

Bonaparte wrote his own official version of what happened, which was published in all newspapers and posted on placards on walls all over France; it vividly described how he had narrowly escaped death from the hands of &quot;twenty Jacobin assassins&quot; and concluded: &quot;The majority returned freely and peacefully to the meeting hall, listened to the propositions which had been made for assuring the public safety, deliberated and prepared a beneficial resolution which should become the new law and basis of the Republic.&quot;

With that event, the Directory was finished. A new government, the Consulate, was founded. According to most historians, the French Revolution was over.

== French society during the Directory ==
Despite wars and social turmoil, the population of France continued to grow during the Directory. It was 27,800,000 in 1796, before the Directory, and had grown to 27,900,000 by 1801. Annual population growth had dropped from 16 percent in 1785, before the Revolution, to zero in 1790; but it then rebounded to 36 percent in 1795, then down to 12 percent in 1800. Part of the drop in birth rate during the Directory is attributed to the simplification of divorce, and the change in inheritance laws, which granted equal shares to all descendants. The number of young men killed in the wars during the Directory numbered 235,000 between 1795 and 1799. The high birth rate before the Revolution – together with conscription from conquered and allied states – allowed Napoleon to fill the ranks of his &quot;Grande Armée&quot; during the Empire between 1804 and 1815.

By the time of the Directory, French society had been dramatically restructured. Nobles and clergy, the two classes which had held most of the power before the Revolution, had disappeared. An estimated one percent of the population, mostly nobles and priests, but also many members of the upper middle class who had supported the monarchy, had emigrated. The number was even higher in border regions, such as Bas-Rhin, where 4.5 percent of the population had left.

=== Rich and poor ===

Under the Directory the middle and upper classes took a dominant position in Paris society, replacing the nobility. Enormous fortunes were made, often by providing supplies to the army or by speculation on real estate. Some parts of the middle and upper classes suffered: the abolition of the old professional guilds of lawyers and doctors brought the ruin of many members, who faced competition from anyone who wanted to use those titles. The merchants and shipowners in Bordeaux, Nantes, Marseille and other ports were ruined by the British naval blockade. Bankers took on a more prominent role, when investment was scarce.

Two new groups gained importance during the Directory. The number of government officials of all levels increased dramatically. The writer Louis-Sébastien Mercier in his &quot;Paris pendant la Révolution (1789–1798), ou Le nouveau Paris&quot;, published in 1800, wrote: &quot;There is no one who has not complained of the insolence, or the ignorance, of the multitude of government officials employed in the bureaus to sharpen their pens and to obstruct the course of affairs. New has the bureaucracy been carried to a point so so exaggerated, so costly, to exhausting.&quot;

Generals and other military officers also grew greatly in importance during the Directory and became a caste independent of the political structure. The Directory had abolished the Jacobin system of political commissioners who supervised and could overrule the military commanders. Generals like Bonaparte in Italy, Hoche in Germany and Pichegru in Alsace directed entire provinces according to their own ideas and wishes, with little interference from Paris. The soldiers of these generals were often more loyal to their generals than to the Directory, as the soldiers of Bonaparte showed during the 1799 coup d&#x27;état that ended the Directory.

The working class and poor in Paris and other large cities suffered particularly from the high inflation during the first part of the Directory, which brought higher prices for bread, meat, wine, firewood and other basic commodities. In the last two years of the Directory, the problem was the opposite: with the suppression of the &quot;assignats&quot;, the money became scarce, the economy slowed, and unemployment grew. The Directory distributed scarce food items, such as cooking oil, butter and eggs, to government employees and to members of the Councils. Before the Revolution, taking care of the poor had been the responsibility of the Church. During the Directory, the government, particularly in Paris and other large cities, was forced to take over this role. To feed the Parisians and prevent food riots, the government bought flour in the countryside at market prices with its silver coins, then gave it to the bakeries, which sold it at the traditional market price of four sous a pound, which was virtually nothing. The subsidies were reduced in the last years of the Directory, paying only for bread, but they were an enormous expense for the Directory. At the beginning, the government tried to provide the standard minimum of one pound of bread a day per person, but the shortage of money reduced the daily ration to sixty grams of bread a day. The government also tried giving rice as a substitute for bread, but the poor lacked firewood to cook it.

Under the Directory a system of public charity &quot;was finally put in place with some success,&quot; with legislation passed in November 1796 establishing bureaux de bienfaisance in every commune. These were responsible for providing home relief. Funding for state hospitals was also increased, and legislation from December 1796 placed abandoned children under the state&#x27;s care.

=== Crime and corruption ===
Economic problems led to a large increase in crime under The Directory, particularly in the countryside. Bands of the unemployed became beggars and turned to robbery, and brigands robbed travelers along the highways. Some of the brigands were former royalists turned highwaymen. They were later celebrated in the novel of Alexander Dumas, &quot;Les Compagnons de Jéhu&quot; (&quot;The Companions of Jehu&quot;). The government did not have the money to hire more police, and the great majority of the army was occupied fighting in Italy, Switzerland and Egypt. The growing insecurity on the roads seriously harmed commerce in France. The problem of brigands and highwaymen was not seriously addressed until after a serious wave of crimes on the roads in the winter of 1797–98. The Councils passed a law calling for the death penalty for any robbery committed on the main highways or against a public vehicle, such as a coach, even if nothing was taken. If the crime was committed by more than one person, the robbers were tried by a military tribunal rather than a civilian court. The wave of highway robberies was finally stopped by Bonaparte and the Consulate, which employed special tribunals even swifter and more severe than the Directory tribunals.

Corruption was another serious problem, particularly with the businessmen who provided supplies to the army and government. In one case, the Chevalier enterprise received a contract to build three large warships and two frigates at Rochefort; the company was paid in national property seized from the aristocracy and the Church, but it never constructed the ships, or even bought the materials. Huge contracts for government supplies were passed from the furnishers to sub-contractors, who each paid the furnisher a fee. Sometimes contractors demanded to be paid for their services in advance in silver. They were paid, but never delivered the services, and then reimbursed the government with nearly-worthless assignats. The Directors themselves were accused of receiving money from contractors. The Minister of Finance of the Directory, Dominique-Vincent Ramel-Nogaret, was offered 100,000 francs for a bribe to give a contract by a furnisher named Langlois. Ramel refused and turned Langlois over to the police; however, some ministers and Directors, like Barras, left the government with large fortunes. The Directory was unable to escape the accusations of widespread corruption.

=== &quot;Muscadins&quot;, &quot;Incroyables&quot; and &quot;Merveilleuses&quot; ===

Born in reaction against the strict codes of behavior established during the Convention and the Reign of Terror, the &quot;Muscadins&quot; were fashionable young men who carried canes and sometimes, in groups, attacked sans-culottes. Following soon afterwards, the Directory had its own fashion reflecting the new social behavior and carried out by young Parisians of both sexes, from middle and upper-class families, often survivors of the excesses of the Revolution, who had lost parents and family members to the guillotine. They were called &quot;Incroyables and Merveilleuses&quot; and dressed in extravagant costumes. The men, the &quot;Incroyables&quot;, wore long hair to their shoulders, round hats with broad brims, short coats and silk culottes. Their female counterparts, the &quot;Merveilleuses&quot;, wore flowing, high-breasted transparent dresses reminiscent of the Greco-Roman era. They frequented balls called &quot;Bals des victimes&quot; and spoke in their own particular accent and vocabulary, avoiding to pronounce the letter &quot;R&quot;, as it was the first letter of the word &quot;Revolution&quot;.

=== Marriage and divorce ===
During the Directory, almost all the structures and rules of Paris society had been swept away, but no new structures and rules had yet been created to replace them. The brothers Goncourt meticulously described the period on their &quot;Histoire de la société française pendant le Directoire&quot;. Caste and rank mattered far less; all the old titles and forms of address had disappeared, along with old customs and social conventions. Men no longer took off their hats when talking to women, and people of different ranks spoke to each other as equals. Society no longer met in private, in the houses of the nobility, but in public, at balls, restaurants and public gardens. As the Goncourts said, &quot;social anarchy&quot; reigned in Paris: &quot;everyone met with everyone.&quot; Government ministers could be seen walking or dining with actresses, bankers with courtesans.
&quot;Liaisons were easy&quot;, the Goncourts reported, &quot;marriage less so.&quot; The old system of marriages arranged between families based on fortune, profession, and social condition was less common. Marriages were no longer controlled by the church, but by the new civil code, which described marriage as &quot;nature in action.&quot; Marriage was seen as a temporary, not a permanent state. Children born outside of marriage were given equal status concerning inheritance and other legal matters as those born to married couples. Divorce was much simpler, and could be requested by either the husband or wife. In one period of fifteen months, 5,994 civil law divorces were granted in Paris, of which 3,886 were requested by the wife. Of 1,148 divorces granted on the grounds of &quot;incompatibility of humor&quot;, 887 were requested by the wife. The new system also led to a large increase in the number of children born outside of marriage and not wanted; in 1795 four thousand unwanted children in the Department of the Seine were turned over to foundling hospitals.

The breakdown of the old system of arranged marriages led to the creation of the first newspaper where men and women could advertise themselves for suitable spouses, called the &quot;Indicateur des marriages&quot;. It also led to the establishment of the first marriage bureaus. A businessman named Liardot rented a large former mansion, brought in selected eligible young women as paying guests, and invited men seeking wives to meet them at balls, concerts and card games each given at the house each evening. The men were screened by their profession and education.

=== Amusement – &quot;Bals des victimes&quot;, pleasure gardens, new restaurants and cafés ===
Although balls were not banned during the Reign of Terror, after the death of Robespierre and the fall of the Jacobins, the city experienced a frenzy of dancing that lasted throughout the period of the French Directory. The Goncourt brothers reported that 640 balls took place in 1797 alone. Several former monasteries were turned into ballrooms, including the Noviciate of the Jesuits, the &quot;Monastère des Carmes&quot; (turned into a prison where 191 members of the Catholic Church — bishops, priests, monks — were massacred on 2 September 1792), the &quot;Séminaire Saint-Sulpice&quot;, and even in the former Saint-Sulpice cemetery. Some of the former palatial townhouses of the nobility were rented and used for ballrooms; the &quot;Hôtel de Longueville&quot; near the Louvre put on enormous spectacles, with three hundred couples dancing, in thirty circles of sixteen dancers each, the women in nearly transparent dresses, styled after Roman tunics. In the public balls, everyone danced with everyone; merchants, clerks, artisans and workers danced with shop women and seamstresses. In the more popular public balls, the &quot;cavaliers&quot; were charged 80 sous for admission, while women paid 12 sous. At more exclusive balls, admission was five livres. Aristocrats who had survived or returned from exile held their own balls in their houses in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, where &quot;Bals des victimes&quot; (&quot;Balls of the victims&quot;) were attended by invitees who had lost at least one parent to the guillotine.

The formal dancing of the minuet was replaced by a much more passionate new dance, the waltz, which was introduced to Paris during this time from Germany. For summer evening entertainment, Parisians began to abandon the Tuileries Gardens and the gardens of the Palais-Royal and went to the new pleasure gardens which appeared in the neighborhood between the Grands boulevards and the Palais-Royal. The most famous was the &quot;Jardin de Tivoli&quot;, also known as &quot;Folie Boutin&quot; or &quot;Grand Tivoli&quot;, located on rue Saint-Lazare. It had belonged to an aristocrat named Boutin, who was guillotined during the Reign of Terror. It was a vast garden covering 40 &quot;arpents&quot; (ca. 20 hectares), and could hold as many as ten thousand persons. It had alleys filled with promenaders, greenhouses, illuminations, an orchestra, dancing, a café, and fireworks at night. Other new gardens competed by adding spectacles and pageants. The &quot;Jardin des Champs-Élysées&quot; offered a pageant of costumed soldiers on horseback performing elaborate maneuvers and firing weapons. The &quot;Mousseau&quot; (now &quot;Parc Monceau&quot;) had performers dressed as American Indians dancing and fighting battles. The former &quot;Pavillon de Hanovre&quot;, which had been part of the Duke of Richelieu&#x27;s residential complex, featured a terrace for dancing and dining decorated with Turkish tents, Chinese kiosks and lanterns.

Many new restaurants and cafés, usually close to the twenty-three theaters, appeared in and around the Palais-Royal and the new boulevards. A new café, the &quot;Tortoni&quot;, specializing in ice creams, opened in 1795 at the corner of the boulevard des Italiens and &quot;rue Taitbout&quot;. The new restaurants in the Palais-Royal were often run by the former chefs of archbishops and aristocrats who had gone into exile. The restaurant &quot;Méot&quot; offered a menu with over one hundred dishes. Beside the &quot;Méot&quot; and &quot;Beauvilliers&quot;, under the arcades of the Palais-Royal were the restaurants and cafés such as &quot;Naudet&quot;, &quot;Robert&quot;, &quot;Véry&quot;, &quot;Foy&quot;, &quot;Huré&quot; , &quot;Berceau&quot;, &quot;Lyrique&quot;, &quot;Liberté conquise&quot;, &quot;de Chartres&quot; (now &quot;Le Grand Véfour&quot;), and &quot;du Sauvage&quot; (the last owned by the former coachman of Robespierre). In the cellars of the Palais-Royal were more popular cafés, usually with music, smaller menus at more reasonable prices. One of those, the &quot;Postal&quot; , offered a menu for just 36 sous. Many of the cafés in the cellars had orchestras; the most famous was the &quot;Café des Aveugles&quot;, with an orchestra of four blind musicians.

After the Reign of Terror had ended, dining hours for upper-class Parisians returned gradually to what they had been before the Revolution, with &quot;déjeuner&quot; at midday, dinner at 6 or 7 in the evening, and supper at 2 in the morning. When the theater performances ended at 10 PM, the spectators went to the nearby cafés on the boulevards.

== Church and State ==

The Roman Catholic Church suffered significant loss of property and political influence during the French Revolution. Priests, who refused to take an oath to the Civil Constitution of the Clergy emigrated or were expelled from France under a penalty of death. Church property, from cathedrals to candlesticks, was seized and sold. Church ceremonies were banned, causing clandestine religious services to be conducted in private homes. During the Reign of Terror, at Robespierre&#x27;s urging, the National Convention, on 7 May 1794, proclaimed a new religion, the Cult of the Supreme Being, which in a little over a year led to the Thermidorian Reaction, and Robespierre&#x27;s downfall and execution. The Roman Catholic Church had been the official state religion during the monarchy, and the Directors were all anti-religious republicans, but the Directory, with a few exceptions, did not try to impose any particular religious views, and its policy toward priests and religious institutions changed depending upon political events. After the fall of Robespierre, the repression against the Church eased and, although the policy of repression remained, many churches, especially in the provinces, re-opened, and exiled priests began to quietly return.

In November 1797, working with the new decimal-based Republican Calendar, the week of which has ten days, the Directory replaced Sundays and religious holidays with republican celebrations. The tenth day of the week, called &quot;decadi&quot;, was designated to replace Sunday. The churches still functioning with Constitutional priests were instructed to have mass on &quot;decadi&quot;, rather than on the day that would have been Sunday in the previous calendar, and &quot;decadi&quot; became the official non-working day: government employees were off, and schools, shops and markets were closed. To replace saints&#x27; and religious days, a whole series of secular holidays was created, in addition to the patriotic celebrations already in place, such as 14 July and important dates of the French Revolution. There were also special days, such as, &quot;the day of the sovereignty of the people&quot;; &quot;the day of youth&quot;; &quot;the day of spouses&quot;; &quot;the day of agriculture&quot; and &quot;the day of the elderly&quot;. Certain churches were given new names: the cathedral Notre Dame de Paris was renamed &quot;Temple of the Supreme Being&quot;, Saint-Étienne-du-Mont became the &quot;Temple of Filial piety&quot;. On &quot;decadi&quot;, the constitutional priests who performed services were required to share the space with other republican religions and associations who wanted to use the buildings. Large churches were divided into sections for use by various religions.

A new religion, Theophilanthropy, had been founded in 1796 by a Freemason printer-bookseller named Jean-Baptiste Chemin-Dupontès (1760–1852?). It was encouraged by the Director La Révellière-Lépeaux and the Ministry of the Interior, with the state paying for its newspaper. Members believed in God and in the immortality of the soul, but not in the original sin. The sect was similar in form to Calvinism, with readings aloud of texts, hymns and sermons. With the support of the Directory, the sect was given four churches in Paris, including Saint-Roch, Saint-Sulpice and, in April 1798, Notre-Dame de Paris, as well as churches in Dijon, Poitiers and Bordeaux. Members of the sect included some prominent figures, such as General Hoche, the industrialist Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, the painter Jean-Baptiste Regnault, and the American philosopher and political activist Thomas Paine. Beginning in May 1798, however, the Directory began to withdraw support from the newly established deistic sect, which it considered too close to the Jacobins. The sect still had eighteen churches in 1799, but in 1801 it was abolished by Bonaparte.

In Italy, the French army attacked the Papal States governed by the Roman Catholic Church in Italy. In February 1797, Bonaparte occupied Ancona to force Pope Pius VI to negotiate. The pope was obliged to cede Ancona and the northern part of his states, creating the French-sponsored Anconine Republic. The gold and silver in the treasury of the Vatican was taken to France to help support the French currency. Following anti-French riots in Rome in December 1797, a French army under Berthier entered Rome and proclaimed a Roman Republic. Pius VI was taken prisoner by the French Army, and transferred to Valence in France, where he was kept prisoner until his death in 1801.

== Economy ==
=== Finance ===
Many of the economic, social and political woes during the Directory were results of the breakdown of the financial system. The principal problem was a great shortage of money with real value; that is, coins made of silver, and an excess of paper money, the value of which shrank as more and more was printed. The Directory produced only 32 million livres worth of silver-based coins in its first two years. Much of this money was hoarded, since, unlike the paper money, it had and retained real value. As a consequence, the government, to cover its costs, was forced to print millions of notes, first called &quot;assignats&quot; and then &quot;mandats&quot;, which were based on the value of property seized from the Church and the clergy. These notes declined in value as more and more were printed. When the notes became nearly worthless, the Directory first devalued them and finally gave up and stopped printing paper money. The shortage of real money in the second part of the Directory led to a new problem: shortage of credit; interest rates rose to about ten percent, double what they had been in 1789. The consequence in the last two years of the Directory was a decline in economic activity, and in wages, while prices rose. The population lost confidence in the money and in the Directory&#x27;s management.

The lack of credit led to the creation of a number of new private banks, and the growing importance of banks and bankers in the economy. The &quot;Caisse des comptes courants&quot;, created in June 1796, had some of the most important industrialists and financiers in France as its founders, who would later become the founders of the &quot;Banque de France&quot;. Several other new private banks followed, which concentrated the wealth of France even more in Paris. Since the nobility had gone into exile, the bankers became the new nobility of France. In other words, bankers became the new aristocrats.

=== Transportation and commerce ===
The transportation system within France was another handicap to the economy. The roads and canals had not been improved or maintained since the overthrow of the monarchy. Major canals that had been started in Burgundy and in the north were unfinished. Maritime commerce was in an even worse situation as a result of the war and blockade of French ports by Britain. During the Directory, the number of French ships of more than two hundred tons was one tenth of what it had been in 1789. The conquest of Belgium, the Netherlands and Italy improved the situation somewhat: French goods could be transported on the neutral ships of these countries, and maritime traffic on the Baltic Sea to Germany became an important trade route for France. However, the British navy largely cut off the trade with the French colonies in the Caribbean, which earlier had provided sugar, cotton, indigo and coffee to France; and the entry of the fleet of Admiral Nelson into the Mediterranean Sea cut off the trade routes there. The major ports of Nantes and Marseille saw their commerce and trade routes disappear.

=== Industry ===
The continual wars and fiscal crises greatly limited the expansion of French industry. The Industrial Revolution had only just begun in France. Production during the Directory had fallen below what it was in 1789. The number of workers in the silk industry in Lyon had dropped from 12,000 before 1787 to 6,500. The cotton textile industry was more successful due to the embargo against British products caused by the war. New factories and new technologies, such as mechanical looms, were introduced in Normandy and in Alsace. However, the technologies were still primitive; the steam engine had not yet arrived in French factories. The chemical industry was also advancing rapidly during the Directory; the chemist and entrepreneur Jean Antoine Claude Chaptal built a chemical factory in Montpellier, which he soon moved to Chaillot, a village west of Paris. The most effective promoter of French industry was François de Neufchâteau, who was Minister of the Interior before becoming a Director in 1797. He planned a new canal system, began work on a new road across the Pyrenees, and organized the first national industrial exposition in Paris, which opened with great success in October 1798. Once he became Consul, Bonaparte copied the idea of the industrial exposition. Despite this bright spot, French industry was primitive: without steam power, most factories in France depended upon water power, and the metallurgy industry still melted iron with wood fires, not oil.

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture was another weak spot of the French economy. While the country was essentially rural, the methods of farming had not been changed in centuries. The vast majority of farmers had small plots of land, sold little and worked essentially to produce enough food for their families. The price of grain was freed from government control under the Directory in 1797, and farmers could sell their grain at whatever price they could get. Following the Revolution in 1789, the forests had been taken away from the nobles and opened to everyone; as a result, large areas of the forests were immediately cut down, and no new trees planted to replace them. The land of the nobility and Church was taken and redistributed to peasants, but under the new inheritance laws, which gave equal shares to all sons, the size of the farm plots became smaller and smaller. Small plots were not consolidated into larger fields, as was taking place in England at the same time. Most farmers were reluctant to try new methods; they did not want to leave fields idle to recover productivity, or to grow forage crops to feed cattle. Furthermore, during the endless wars of the Directory, thousands of farmers were taken into the army, and thousands of horses and mules needed for farming were taken by the Army for the use of the cavalry and transport. Under these conditions, food shortages and famines occurred regularly in France until the time of Napoleon III.

== Education and science ==
The education system of France was in a chaotic state at the beginning of the Directory. The College of Sorbonne and most other colleges of the University of Paris, had been closed because of their close association with the Catholic Church, and did not reopen until 1808. The schools run by the Catholic Church had also been closed, and any kind of religious instruction forbidden. The government of Jacobins during the Convention created several new scientific institutions, but had concentrated on primary education, which it decreed should be obligatory and free for all young people, but there were few teachers available. By forbidding religious education, seizing the property of the Church and chasing out the clergy, they effectively closed the largest part of the educational system of the country.

At the beginning of the period, the Directory reversed the policy of obligatory and free education for all, largely because of the lack of money to pay teachers. The Directory began to create a system of central schools, with the goal of one in each department, which boys could attend from the age of twelve, with a full curriculum of sciences, history and literature. The state paid a part of the cost, while each student also paid the professor a fee. The new schools had libraries (mostly confiscated from the nobility), small botanical gardens, and museums of natural history. For the first time in French schools, French instead of Latin was the basis of education. Three of these schools were organized in Paris; two of them later became the famous Lycée Henri-IV and Lycée Charlemagne. But by the end of the Directory there were only 992 students in the three Paris schools.

For primary education, each &quot;arrondissement&quot; in Paris had one school for boys and another for girls, and each commune in the country was supposed to have the same. Since the state lacked money, teachers were paid by the commune or by the students. Students would graduate after learning to read, write and count. In villages, the school was often located in the former church, and teachers were expected, as part of their duties, to carry water, clean the church, ring the bells, and, when needed, dig graves in the churchyard cemetery.

The choices were greater for the children of the middle and upper middle class, as these families had tutors, or sent their children to private schools, but for much of the population, schooling was minimal. There were 56 public schools in the Seine department, which by the population should have had at least 20,000 students; but they had only between 1100 and 1200.

The continual wars during the Directory also had their effect on education. Beginning in October 1797, boys in public schools were required to take part in periodic military exercises, and the Directory established five military schools, called &quot;Écoles de Mars&quot;, for a total of 15,000 students. Attendance was a requirement for entry into the higher schools of engineering and public works.

The Directory focused its attention on secondary education and especially on creating specialized higher schools for training managers, judges, doctors and engineers, for which there was an immediate and pressing need. The had been founded by a member of the Directory, Lazare Carnot and the mathematician Gaspard Monge, in 1794. The school became the most prestigious engineering and public works school in France. However, by the end of the Directory there were still no law schools, and only two schools of medicine outside of Paris.

The &quot;&quot; was also founded in 1795 by Lazare Carnot and Monge, to bring together the scientists and researchers, who previously had worked in separate academies, to share knowledge and ideas. It was divided into three large sections: physical sciences and mathematics; moral and political science; and literature and the fine arts. It organized the large party of scientists and scholars who accompanied Napoleon to Egypt, which discovered such treasures as the Rosetta Stone, which allowed the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphs. One of the first members and speakers was Napoléon Bonaparte, who took the place of Carnot after the latter had been removed from the Directory and left France.

== Art and culture==
=== Painting – The Salon and the Louvre ===
The artists of Paris were in a difficult situation during the Directory, as their most important patrons, the aristocracy, had been executed or had emigrated; however a new wealthy class was just being formed. Before the Revolution a half-figure portrait could be commissioned from a less-known artist for three hundred livres. During the Directory, the price fell to forty-eight livres. Nonetheless, the &quot;Salon&quot; took place in the Louvre in 1795 as it had since 1725, before the Revolution, and each year thereafter. The most prominent artist of the Revolution, Jacques-Louis David, closely connected with the Jacobins, was in seclusion in his studio inside the Louvre. At the end of the period, in 1799, he produced one important work, the &quot;Intervention of the Sabine Women&quot;. However, a new generation of artists, inspired by David, showed their works; François Gérard; Anne-Louis Girodet, a pupil of David, renown for his romantic paintings, particularly a 1797 painting of the prominent actress Mademoiselle Lange as Venus; Carle Vernet, the son and father of famous painters; the portrait painter and miniaturist Jean-Baptiste Isabey, known as the &quot;painter of the kings&quot; or &quot;portraitist of Europe&quot;, who painted Queen Marie-Antoinette and Empress Joséphine, and remained active until the Second Empire; the genre painter Louis-Léopold Boilly; Antoine-Jean Gros, a young history and landscape painter, who soon achieved fame and a government position in 1796 with a heroic portrait of Bonaparte at the Battle of Arcole; the romantic landscapes of Hubert Robert; Pierre-Paul Prud&#x27;hon, whose work combined Neoclassicism and Romanticism; and a major neoclassical sculptor from the earlier generation, Jean-Antoine Houdon, famous for his busts of George Washington and Voltaire.

Making the Louvre into an art museum had first been proposed in 1747 by Étienne La Font de Saint-Yenne and supported by Denis Diderot in 1765 in the article on the Louvre in the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. The idea was accepted by Louis XVI who, in 1789, began work on converting the &quot;Grande Galerie&quot; of the Louvre to a museum space. The Revolution intervened, and on 27 July 1793 the Convention decreed the creation of a Museum of the Republic (&quot;Musée de la République française&quot;), which opened on 10 August 1793, the first anniversary of the storming of the Tuileries.

In 1797, at the end of Bonaparte&#x27;s triumphant first Italian campaign, convoys of wagons began arriving in Paris, carrying bronze horses, Greek antiquities, tapestries, marble statues, paintings and other works of art taken from Italian cities under the terms of peace agreed by the Austrians. They included works by Raphael, Leonardo da Vinci, Titian, Paolo Veronese and other masters. Other convoys arrived from the Netherlands and Flanders. The more famous works were displayed on wagons in a festive victory parade through the center of Paris. The rest was crammed, unwrapped, into the corridors, galleries and stairways of the Louvre. Work began to rebuild the &quot;Galerie d&#x27;Apollon&quot; and other galleries to provide a home for the &#x27;newly acquired&#x27; art.

=== Furniture and decoration – the &quot;Directoire&quot; style ===
The Directory had no public money to spend on architecture, but the newly-wealthy upper class had abundant money to buy châteaux and town houses, and to redecorate them. The style of interior decoration, known as the &quot;Directoire style&quot;, was one of the notable contributions of the period. It was a transitional style, a compromise between the Louis XVI style and French neoclassicism. Riesener, the famous furniture designer for Louis XVI, did not die until 1806, though his clientele changed from the nobility to the wealthy new upper class. The Directory saw the first widespread use of mahogany, an imported tropical wood used in the making of furniture.
=== Literature ===
The Directory period produced a small number of important literary works, often very critical of the excesses of Revolution. These included &quot;Essay on the Revolutions&quot; by Chateaubriand, published in 1797, which called for a return to Christian values. At the complete opposite end of the literary scale was the last major work of the Marquis de Sade, &quot;The New Justine&quot;, published in 1797. Sade also wrote a satirical brochure mocking thinly-disguised characters resembling Bonaparte and Joséphine. Shortly after the end of the Directory, on 6 March 1801, Sade was arrested for &quot;Justine&quot; and its sequel and ended his days in the insane asylum of Charenton.

== Directory judged by historians ==
=== 19th century ===
Historians generally have not been kind to the &#x27;Age of the Directory&#x27;. Adolphe Thiers, later twice the Prime Minister and the first president of the Third Republic, wrote the first major history in French of the Revolution, in ten volumes, published between 1823 and 1827. He described the Directory this way:
:One of the indispensable qualities of a government is to have good reputation that defends it against unjust attacks. When it has lost this reputation, and when people blame it for the faults of others, and even for bad luck, then it no longer has the ability to govern, and this incapacity should force it to retire. How many governments had been used up during the Revolution!... The Directory had been used up like the Committee of Public Safety before it, and the government of Napoleon that followed. All the accusations against the Directory proved not its faults but its nullity. 

Thiers blamed Barras, the only Director who served from the beginning to the end of the Directory, for its failure.
:By a bizarre chance, but one that is seen often in the conflicts within revolutions, public opinion had indulgence for the one Director who merited it the least. Barras alone deserved all that was said of the Directory. First of all, he never worked; he left to his colleagues all the burden of business. He spoke only at decisive moments, when his voice was stronger than his courage. He occupied himself with nothing. He only concerned himself with the personnel of the government, which best suited his genius at intrigue. He took a share of all the profits of the government suppliers, and alone of the Directors deserved the accusation of corruption. Despite all of his faults, he was treated differently than the others, first of all because, unlike the other four, he was not a lawyer; and despite his laziness, his debauched habits, his bad manners, and his liaisons with the Jacobins, he alone was credited with 18 Fructidor [the downfall of Robespierre], and he gave the appearance of a man of action, more capable of governing than his colleagues... He was even treacherous toward his colleagues; because all of the criticism that he deserved himself he skillfully managed to shift exclusively onto them. 

The most celebrated and vivid description of French society under the Directory was written by the Goncourt brothers, Edmond and Jules, published in 1864, which described the mores, daily life, culture and preoccupations of the Parisians. Its final chapter contained the lines:
:Like a guest at the end of an orgy, France was weary; weary of gods, of tribunes, of heroes, of executioners; weary of struggles, of efforts, of cries, of curses, of enthusiasms, of fevers, of intoxications, of storms, of triumphs, of agonies – France was weary of revolutions, coups d&#x27;états. constitutions, legislatures... weary of conquests, weary of being saved; weary of Belgium submissive, Italy conquered; of Germany, when all the eagles of Germany had been taken to the &quot;Invalides&quot;, but France was still not the head; France was weary of climbing into the sky, of amassing empires, of monopolizing the world; France glutted with glory; France broken, sleeping on a mattress of corpses, sleeping on a bed of laurels. France, emptied of men, of silver, of crimes, of ideas, of eloquence; France, like Mirabeau when he was dying, asking of his doctors and his descendants only one single thing: to sleep!

The shortest and simplest description of the entire period, from the Convention to the Empire, was given by Honoré de Balzac in 1837–43 in his novel &quot;Illusions perdues&quot;. The Spanish Jesuit diplomat Carlos Herrera tells Lucien de Rubempré: &quot;In 1793 the French invented government by the people, which ended with an absolute emperor. So much for your national history&quot;.

=== 20th and 21st century ===
In 1909, Pyotr Kropotkin wrote:
:The Directory was a terribly orgy of the middle classes, in which the fortunes acquired during the Revolution, especially during the Thermidorean reaction, were squandered in unbridled luxury. For if the Revolution had put in circulation eight milliards of paper-money, the Thermidorean reaction went ten times as fast in that direction, for it issued the amazing sum of thirty milliards in paper &quot;within fifteen months&quot;.

In 1971, Robert Roswell Palmer wrote:
:The Directory became a kind of ineffective dictatorship. It repudiated most of the assignats [paper money] and the debt but failed to restore financial confidence or stability. Guerrilla activity flared up again in the Vendée and other parts of western France. The religious schism became more acute; the Directory took severe measures toward the refractory clergy [those who would not swear allegiance to the government].

In 1971, the American historians Jerome Blum, Rondo Cameron, and Thomas G. Barnes wrote:
:It was a government of self-interest rather than virtue, thus losing any claim on idealism. It never had a strong base of popular support; when elections were held, most of its candidates were defeated. Historians have been quite negative on the Directory&#x27;s use of military force to overturn election returns that went against them. [...] Having by this coup d&#x27;état forfeited its claim to be a constitutional government, the Directory henceforth clung to power only by such illegal acts as purges and quashed elections.

In the 1970s, other historians wrote that the achievements of the Directory were minor, though it did establish administrative procedures and financial reforms that worked out well when Napoleon started using them. It was blamed for creating chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression.

In 1994, Isser Woloch wrote:
:The Terror had left a dual legacy that made such normalcy impossible. On the one hand, massive disengagement, apathy, and cynicism about government; on the other hand, rancorous, violent hostility between the politically engaged minorities of royalists and Jacobins, between whom the directorial moderates vainly attempted to navigate. Legality became the main casualty in this situation.

In 2007, Howard Brown wrote:
:The four years of the Directory were a time of chronic disquiet and the late atrocities had made goodwill between parties impossible. The same instinct of self-preservation which had led the members of the Convention to claim so large a part in the new legislature and the whole of the Directory impelled them to keep their predominance. War was at the center of attention, not only for the survival of France but for the loot and forced payments into the French treasury.

== Leadership and composition ==
The Directory was officially led by a president, as stipulated by Article 141 of the Constitution of the Year III. An entirely ceremonial post, the first presidency was held by Rewbell who was chosen by lot on 2 November 1795. The directors conducted their elections privately, and appointed a new president every three months. The last president was Gohier, who resigned during Brumaire after his arrest by troops under the Bonapartist general Jean Victor Marie Moreau.

<text>The World Economic Forum (WEF) is an international advocacy non-governmental organization and think tank, based in Cologny, Canton of Geneva, Switzerland. It was founded on 24 January 1971 by German engineer Klaus Schwab. 

The foundation&#x27;s stated mission is &quot;improving the state of the world by engaging business, political, academic, and other leaders of society to shape global, regional, and industry agendas&quot;.

The foundation is mostly funded by its 1,000 member multi-national companies.

The WEF is mostly known for its annual meeting at the end of January in Davos, a mountain resort in the canton of Graubünden, in the eastern Alps region of Switzerland. The meeting brings together some 3,000 paying members and selected participants – among whom are investors, business leaders, political leaders, economists, celebrities and journalists – for up to five days to discuss global issues across 500 sessions.

Aside from Davos, the organization convenes regional conferences, it produces a series of reports, engages its members in sector-specific initiatives and provides a platform for leaders from selected stakeholder groups to collaborate on projects and initiatives.

The World Economic Forum and its annual meeting in Davos have received criticism over the years, including allegations of the organization&#x27;s corporate capture of global and democratic institutions, institutional whitewashing initiatives, the public cost of security, the organization&#x27;s tax-exempt status, unclear decision processes and membership criteria, a lack of financial transparency, and the environmental footprint of its annual meetings.

==History==


The WEF was founded in 1971 by Klaus Schwab, a business professor at the University of Geneva. First named the European Management Forum, it changed its name to the World Economic Forum in 1987 and sought to broaden its vision to include providing a platform for resolving international conflicts.

In February 1971, Schwab invited 450 executives from Western European firms to the first European Management Symposium held in the Davos Congress Centre under the patronage of the European Commission and European industrial associations, where Schwab sought to introduce European firms to American management practices. He then founded the WEF as a nonprofit organization based in Geneva and drew European business leaders to Davos for the annual meetings each January.

The second European Management Forum in 1972 was the first meeting where a head of government featured as a speaker, Prime Minister Pierre Werner of Luxembourg.

Events in 1973, including the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed-exchange rate mechanism and the Yom Kippur War, saw the annual meeting expand its focus from management to economic and social issues, and, for the first time, political leaders were invited to the annual meeting in January 1974.

Through the forum&#x27;s first decade, it maintained a playful atmosphere, with many members skiing and participating in evening events. Appraising the 1981 event, one attendee noted that &quot;the forum offers a delightful vacation on the expense account.&quot;

Political leaders soon began to use the annual meeting as venue for promoting their interests. The &quot;Davos Declaration&quot; was signed in 1988 by Greece and Turkey, helping them turn back from the brink of war. In 1992, South African President F. W. de Klerk met with Nelson Mandela and Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi at the annual meeting, their first joint appearance outside South Africa. At the 1994 annual meeting, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO chairman Yasser Arafat reached a draft agreement on Gaza and Jericho.

After 9/11, the WEF was held in the U.S., in New York City, for the first time. And in January 2003, U.S. Secretary of State Powell went to the forum to drum up sympathy for the global war on terrorism and the U.S.&#x27;s impending invasion of Iraq.

In October 2004, the World Economic Forum gained attention through the resignation of its CEO and executive director José María Figueres over the undeclared receipt of more than US$900,000 in consultancy fees from the French telecommunications firm Alcatel. Transparency International highlighted this incident in their Global Corruption Report two years later in 2006.

In January 2006, the WEF published an article in its &quot;Global Agenda&quot; magazine titled &quot;Boycott Israel&quot;, which was distributed to all 2,340 participants of the annual meeting. Following the publication, Klaus Schwab described the publication as &quot;an unacceptable failure in the editorial process&quot;.

In late 2015, the invitation was extended to include a North Korean delegation for the 2016 WEF, &quot;in view of positive signs coming out of the country&quot;, the WEF organizers noted. North Korea has not been attending the WEF since 1998. The invitation was accepted. However, WEF revoked the invitation on 13 January 2016, after the 6 January 2016 North Korean nuclear test, and the country&#x27;s attendance was made subject to &quot;existing and possible forthcoming sanctions&quot;. Despite protests by North Korea calling the decision by the WEF managing board a &quot;sudden and irresponsible&quot; move, the WEF committee maintained the exclusion because &quot;under these circumstances there would be no opportunity for international dialogue&quot;.

In 2017, the WEF in Davos attracted considerable attention when, for the first time, a head of state from the People&#x27;s Republic of China was present at the alpine resort. With the backdrop of Brexit, an incoming protectionist US administration and significant pressures on free trade zones and trade agreements, Paramount leader Xi Jinping defended the global economic scheme, and portrayed China as a responsible nation and a leader for environmental causes. He sharply rebuked the current populist movements that would introduce tariffs and hinder global commerce, warning that such protectionism could foster isolation and reduced economic opportunity.

In 2018, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave the keynote speech, becoming the first head of government from India to deliver the inaugural keynote for the annual plenary at Davos. Modi highlighted global warming (climate change), terrorism and protectionism as the three major global challenges, and expressed confidence that they can be tackled with collective effort.

In 2019, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro gave the keynote address at the plenary session of the conference. On his first international trip to Davos, he emphasized liberal economic policies despite his populist agenda, and attempted to reassure the world that Brazil is a protector of the rain forest while utilizing its resources for food production and export. He stated that &quot;his government will seek to better integrate Brazil into the world by mainstreaming international best practices, such as those adopted and promoted by the OECD&quot;. Environmental concerns like extreme weather events, and the failure of climate change mitigation and adaptation were among the top-ranking global risks expressed by WEF attendees. On June 13, 2019, the WEF and the United Nations signed a &quot;Strategic Partnership Framework&quot; in order to &quot;jointly accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.&quot;

The 2021 World Economic Forum was due to be held from 17 to 20 August in Singapore. However, on 17 May the Forum was cancelled; with a new meeting to take place in the first half of 2022 instead with a final location and date to be determined later in 2021.

In late December 2021, the World Economic Forum said in a release that pandemic conditions had made it extremely difficult to stage a global in-person meeting the following month; transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and its impact on travel and mobility had made deferral necessary, with the meeting in Davos eventually rescheduled for 22 to 26 May 2022.

Topics in the 2022 annual meeting included the Russian invasion of Ukraine, climate change, energy insecurity and inflation. Ukraine&#x27;s president Volodymyr Zelenskyy gave a special address at the meeting, thanking the global community for its efforts but also calling for more support. The 2022 Forum was marked by the absence of a Russian delegation for the first time since 1991, which &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; described as signalling the &quot;unraveling of globalization.&quot; The former Russia House was used to present Russia&#x27;s war crimes.

The 2023 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum took place in Davos, Switzerland from 16–20 January under the theme &quot;Cooperation in a fragmented world&quot;.

==Organization==
Headquartered in Cologny, the WEF also has offices in New York, Beijing, Tokyo and Seoul. In January 2015, it was designated an NGO with &quot;other international body&quot; status by the Swiss Federal Government under the Swiss Host-State Act.

On 10 October 2016, the WEF announced the opening of its new Center for the Fourth Industrial Revolution in San Francisco. According to the WEF, the center will &quot;serve as a platform for interaction, insight and impact on the scientific and technological changes that are changing the way we live, work and relate to one another&quot;.

The World Economic Forum declares that it is impartial and that it is not tied to any political, partisan, or national interests. Until 2012, it had observer status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council; it is under the supervision of the Swiss Federal Council. The foundation&#x27;s highest governance body is the foundation board.

The managing board is chaired by the WEF&#x27;s president, Børge Brende, and acts as the executive body of the World Economic Forum. Managing board members are Børge Brende, Julien Gattoni, Jeremy Jurgens, Adrian Monck, Sarita Nayyar, Olivier M. Schwab, Saadia Zahidi, and Alois Zwinggi.

===Board of trustees===
The WEF is chaired by founder and executive chairman Professor Klaus Schwab and is guided by a board of trustees that is made up of leaders from business, politics, academia and civil society. 

As of 2024, the board of trustees is composed of: Queen Rania of Jordan, Mukesh D. Ambani, Ajay S. Banga, Marc Benioff, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Thomas Buberl, Laurence D. Fink, Chrystia Freeland, Orit Gadiesh, Kristalina Georgieva, Fabiola Gianotti, Al Gore, Andre Hoffmann, Paula Ingabire, Joe Kaeser, Christine Lagarde, Yo-Yo Ma, Patrice Motsepe, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Lubna S. Olayan, David M. Rubenstein, Ulf Mark Schneider, Klaus Schwab, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Jim Hagemann Snabe, Julie Sweet, Feike Sijbesma, Heizō Takenaka and Zhu Min.

Members of the board of trustees (past or present) include: Al Gore, Herman Gref, André Hoffmann, Carlos Ghosn, Christine Lagarde, Chrystia Freeland, David Rubenstein, Ernesto Zedillo, Fabiola Gianotti, Feike Sijbesma, Heizō Takenaka, Indra Nooyi, Jack Ma, Jim Hagemann Snabe, José Ángel Gurría, Josef Ackermann, Klaus Schwab, Kofi Annan, Laurence Fink, Leo Rafael Reif, Luis Alberto Moreno, Marc Benioff, Mark Carney, Maurice Lévy, Michael Dell, Mukesh Ambani, Muriel Pénicaud, Niall FitzGerald, Orit Gadiesh, Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Peter Maurer, Queen Rania of Jordan, Rajat Gupta, Susan Hockfield, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Tony Blair, Mark Schneider, Ursula von der Leyen, Yo-Yo Ma, Zhu Min, Ivan Pictet, Joseph P. Schoendorf Peter D. Sutherland and Victor L. L. Chu..

===Membership===
The foundation is funded by its 1,000 member companies, typically global enterprises with more than five billion dollars in turnover (varying by industry and region). These enterprises rank among the top companies within their industry and/or country and play a leading role in shaping the future of their industry and/or region. Membership is stratified by the level of engagement with forum activities, with the level of membership fees increasing as participation in meetings, projects, and initiatives rises. In 2011, an annual membership cost $52,000 for an individual member, $263,000 for &quot;Industry Partner&quot; and $527,000 for &quot;Strategic Partner&quot;. An admission fee costs $19,000 per person. In 2014, WEF raised annual fees by 20 percent, bringing the cost for &quot;Strategic Partner&quot; from CHF 500,000 ($523,000) to CHF 600,000 ($628,000).

==Activities==

===Annual meeting in Davos===

The flagship event of the World Economic Forum is the invitation-only annual meeting held at the end of January in Davos, Switzerland, bringing together chief executive officers from its 1,000 member companies, as well as selected politicians, representatives from academia, NGOs, religious leaders, and the media in an alpine environment. The winter discussions ostensibly focus around key issues of global concern (such as the globalization, capital markets, wealth management, international conflicts, environmental problems and their possible solutions). The participants also take part in role playing events, such as the Investment Heat Map. Informal winter meetings may have led to as many ideas and solutions as the official sessions.

At the 2018 annual meeting, more than 3,000 participants from nearly 110 countries participated in over 400 sessions. Participation included more than 340 public figures, including more than 70 heads of state and government and 45 heads of international organizations; 230 media representatives and almost 40 cultural leaders were represented.

As many as 500 journalists from online, print, radio, and television take part, with access to all sessions in the official program, some of which are also webcast. Not all the journalists are given access to all areas, however. This is reserved for white badge holders. &quot;Davos runs an almost caste-like system of badges&quot;, according to BBC journalist Anthony Reuben. &quot;A white badge means you&#x27;re one of the delegates – you might be the chief executive of a company or the leader of a country (although that would also get you a little holographic sticker to add to your badge), or a senior journalist. An orange badge means you&#x27;re just a run-of-the-mill working journalist.&quot; All plenary debates from the annual meeting also are available on YouTube while photographs are available on Flickr.

==== World Economic Forum 2025 (Davos) ====
The World Economic Forum 2025 took place in Davos, Switzerland, from January 15 to 19, under the theme Rebuilding Trust. The event brought together approximately 3,000 global leaders from over 125 countries, including 350 Heads of state and government, business executives, policymakers, and representatives from international organizations. Discussions focused on geopolitical stability, economic resilience, climate change, artificial intelligence governance, and inclusive economic growth. Sessions covered topics such as the future of global trade, energy transition, and the impact of artificial intelligence and automation on the labor market. Several initiatives were introduced, including policy frameworks for AI regulation, climate financing mechanisms, and economic strategies for sustainable development.

Among the initiatives discussed was the Global India Dialogues, launched by the Motwani Jadeja Foundation, which focused on India’s role in global geopolitics, technology, and innovation. Discussions on gender equity and economic inclusion were also highlighted through initiatives such as the Global Good Alliance for Gender Equity and Equality, which explored the economic impact of investments in women&#x27;s health. The event featured key figures such as Ursula von der Leyen, Antony Blinken, Christian Lindner, and Sam Altman, alongside representatives from the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. The forum underscored the importance of international cooperation in addressing global economic and technological challenges.
====Individual participants====

Some 3,000 individual participants joined the 2020 annual meeting in Davos. Countries with the most attendees include the United States (674 participants), the United Kingdom (270), Switzerland (159), Germany (137) and India (133). Among the attendees were heads of state or government, cabinet ministers, ambassadors, and heads or senior officials of international organizations, including: Sanna Marin (prime minister of Finland), Ursula von der Leyen (president of the European Commission), Christine Lagarde (ECB president), Greta Thunberg (climate activist), Ren Zhengfei (Huawei Technologies founder), Kristalina Georgieva (managing director of the IMF), Deepika Padukone (Bollywood actress), George Soros (investor), and Donald Trump (president of the United States).

An analysis by &quot;The Economist&quot; from 2014 found that the vast majority of participants are male and more than 50 years old. Careers in business account for most of the participants&#x27; backgrounds (1,595 conference attendees), with the remaining seats shared between government (364), NGOs (246) and press (234). Academia, which had been the basis of the first annual conference in 1971, had been marginalised to the smallest participant group (183 attendees).

====Corporate participants====
Next to individual participants, the World Economic Forum maintains a dense network of corporate partners that can apply for different partnership ranks within the forum. For 2019, Bloomberg has identified a total of 436 listed corporates that participated in the annual meeting while measuring a stock underperformance by the Davos participants of around −10% versus the S&amp;P 500 during the same year. Drivers are among others an overrepresentation of financial companies and an underrepresentation of fast-growing health care and information technology businesses at the conference. &quot;The Economist&quot; had found similar results in an earlier study, showing an underperformance of Davos participants against both the MSCI World Index and the S&amp;P 500 between 2009 and 2014.

===Summer annual meeting===
In 2007, the foundation established the Annual Meeting of the New Champions (also called Summer Davos), held annually in China, alternating between Dalian and Tianjin, bringing together 1,500 participants from what the foundation calls Global Growth Companies, primarily from rapidly growing emerging countries such as China, Russia, Mexico, and Brazil, but also including quickly growing companies from developed countries. The meeting also engages with the next generation of global leaders from fast-growing regions and competitive cities, as well as technology pioneers from around the globe. The Premier of China has delivered a plenary address at each annual meeting.

===Regional meetings===

Every year regional meetings take place, enabling close contact among corporate business leaders, local government leaders, and NGOs. Meetings are held in Africa, East Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. The mix of hosting countries varies from year to year, but consistently China and India have hosted throughout the decade since 2000.

===Young Global Leaders===

The group of Young Global Leaders consists of 800 people chosen by the WEF organizers as being representative of contemporary leadership. After five years of participation they are considered alumni. The program has received controversy when Schwab, the founder, admitted to &quot;penetrat[ing]&quot; governments with Young Global Leaders. He added that as of 2017 &quot;more than half&quot; of Justin Trudeau&#x27;s Cabinet had been members of the program.

===Social entrepreneurs===
Since 2000, the WEF has been promoting models developed by those in close collaboration with the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, highlighting social entrepreneurship as a key element to advance societies and address social problems. Selected social entrepreneurs are invited to participate in the foundation&#x27;s regional meetings and the annual meetings where they may meet chief executives and senior government officials. At the annual meeting 2003, for example, Jeroo Billimoria met with Roberto Blois, deputy secretary-general of the International Telecommunication Union, an encounter that produced a key partnership for her organization Child helpline international.

===Research reports===

The foundation also acts as a think tank, publishing a wide range of reports. In particular, &quot;Strategic Insight Teams&quot; focus on producing reports of relevance in the fields of competitiveness, global risks, and scenario thinking.

The &quot;Competitiveness Team&quot; produces a range of annual economic reports (first published in brackets): the Global Competitiveness Report (1979) measured competitiveness of countries and economies; The Global Information Technology Report (2001) assessed their competitiveness based on their IT readiness; the Global Gender Gap Report examined critical areas of inequality between men and women; the Global Risks Report (2006) assessed key global risks; the Global Travel and Tourism Report (2007) measured travel and tourism competitiveness; the Financial Development Report (2008) aimed to provide a comprehensive means for countries to establish benchmarks for various aspects of their financial systems and establish priorities for improvement; and the Global Enabling Trade Report (2008) presented a cross-country analysis of the large number of measures facilitating trade among nations.

The &quot;Risk Response Network&quot; produces a yearly report assessing risks which are deemed to be within the scope of these teams, have cross-industry relevance, are uncertain, have the potential to cause upwards of US$10 billion in economic damage, have the potential to cause major human suffering, and which require a multi-stakeholder approach for mitigation.

In 2020, the forum published a report entitled &quot;Nature Risk Rising: Why the Crisis Engulfing Nature Matters for Business and the Economy&quot;. In this report the forum estimated that approximately half of global GDP is highly or moderately dependent on nature (the same as IPBES&#x27;s 2019 assessment report). The report also found that 1 dollar spent on nature restoration yields 9 dollars in economic benefits.

===Initiatives===
==== Health ====
On 19 January 2017 the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a global initiative to fight epidemics, was launched at WEF in Davos. The internationally funded initiative aims at securing vaccine supplies for global emergencies and pandemics, and to research new vaccines for tropical diseases, that are now more menacing. The project is funded by private and governmental donors, with an initial investment of US$460m from the governments of Germany, Japan and Norway, plus the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.

Between 21 and 24 January 2020, at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, CEPI met with leaders from Moderna to establish plans for a COVID-19 vaccine at the Davos gathering, with a total global case number of 274 and total loss of life the virus at 16. The WHO declared a global health emergency 6 days later.

==== Society ====
The Global Water Initiative brings together diverse stakeholders such as Alcan Inc., the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, USAID India, UNDP India, Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Government of Rajasthan, and the NEPAD Business Foundation to develop public-private partnerships on water management in South Africa and India.

In an effort to combat corruption, the Partnering Against Corruption Initiative (PACI) was launched by CEOs from the engineering and construction, energy and metals, and mining industries at the annual meeting in Davos during January 2004. PACI is a platform for peer exchange on practical experience and dilemma situations. Approximately 140 companies have joined the initiative.

==== Environment ====
In the beginning of the 21st century, the forum began to increasingly deal with environmental issues. In the Davos Manifesto 2020 it is said that a company among other:
* &quot;acts as a steward of the environmental and material universe for future generations. It consciously protects our biosphere and champions a circular, shared and regenerative economy.&quot;
* &quot;responsibly manages near-term, medium-term and long-term value creation in pursuit of sustainable shareholder returns that do not sacrifice the future for the present.&quot;
* &quot;is more than an economic unit generating wealth. It fulfils human and societal aspirations as part of the broader social system. Performance must be measured not only on the return to shareholders, but also on how it achieves its environmental, social and good governance objectives.&quot;

The Environmental Initiative covers climate change and water issues. Under the Gleneagles Dialogue on Climate Change, the U.K. government asked the World Economic Forum at the G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005 to facilitate a dialogue with the business community to develop recommendations for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This set of recommendations, endorsed by a global group of CEOs, was presented to leaders ahead of the G8 Summit in Toyako, Hokkaido, Japan held in July 2008.

In 2016 WEF published an article in which it is said, that in some cases reducing consumption can increase well-being. In the article is mentioned that in Costa Rica the GDP is 4 times smaller than in many countries in Western Europe and North America, but people live longer and better. An American study shows that those whose income is higher than $75,000, do not necessarily have an increase in well-being. To better measure well-being, the New Economics Foundation&#x27;s launched the Happy Planet Index.

In January 2017, WEF launched the Platform for Accelerating the Circular Economy (PACE), which is a global public private partnership seeking to scale circular economy innovations. PACE is co-chaired by Frans van Houten (CEO of Philips), Naoko Ishii (CEO of the Global Environment Facility, and the head of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, the International Resource Panel, Circle Economy, Chatham House, the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment, the United Nations Environment Programme and Accenture serve as knowledge partners, and the program is supported by the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, DSM, FrieslandCampina, Global Affairs Canada, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, Rabobank, Shell, SITRA, and Unilever.

The Forum emphasized its &#x27;Environment and Natural Resource Security Initiative&#x27; for the 2017 meeting to achieve inclusive economic growth and sustainable practices for global industries. With increasing limitations on world trade through national interests and trade barriers, the WEF has moved towards a more sensitive and socially-minded approach for global businesses with a focus on the reduction of carbon emissions in China and other large industrial nations.

Also in 2017, WEF launched the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) for the Earth Initiative, a collaboration among WEF, Stanford University and PwC, and funded through the Mava Foundation. In 2018, WEF announced that one project within this initiative was to be the Earth BioGenome Project, the aim of which is to sequence the genomes of every organism on Earth.

The World Economic Forum is working to eliminate plastic pollution, stating that by 2050 it will consume 15% of the global carbon budget and will pass by its weight fishes in the world&#x27;s oceans. One of the methods is to achieve circular economy.

The theme of the 2020 World Economic Forum annual meeting was &#x27;Stakeholders for a Cohesive and Sustainable World&#x27;. Climate change and sustainability were central themes of discussion. Many argued that GDP is failed to represent correctly the wellbeing and that fossil fuel subsidies should be stopped. Many of the participants said that a better capitalism is needed. Al Gore summarized the ideas in the conference as: &quot;The version of capitalism we have today in our world must be reformed&quot;.

In this meeting the World Economic Forum:

* Launched the Trillion Tree Campaign an initiative aiming to &quot;grow, restore and conserve 1 trillion trees over the next 10 years around the world – in a bid to restore biodiversity and help fight climate change&quot;. Donald Trump joined the initiative. The forum stated that: &quot;Nature-based solutions – locking-up carbon in the world&#x27;s forests, grasslands and wetlands – can provide up to one-third of the emissions reductions required by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets,&quot; adding that the rest should come from the heavy industry, finance and transportation sectors. One of the targets is to unify existing reforestation projects
* Discussed the issue of climate change and called to expanding renewable energy, energy efficiency change the patterns of consumption and remove carbon from the atmosphere. The forum concluded that the climate crisis will become a climate apocalypse should the temperature rise by 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The forum called on governments to fulfil the commitments in Paris Agreement. Jennifer Morgan, special representative for international climate policy of the Federal Foreign Office in Germany, said that as to the beginning of the forum, fossil fuels still get three times more money than climate solutions.

At the 2021 annual meeting UNFCCC launched the &#x27;UN Race-to-Zero Emissions Breakthroughs&#x27;. The aim of the campaign is to transform 20 sectors of the economy in order to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions. At least 20% of each sector should take specific measures, and 10 sectors should be transformed before COP 26 in Glasgow. According to the organizers, 20% is a tipping point, after which the whole sector begins to irreversibly change.

===== Coronavirus and green recovery =====
In April 2020, the forum published an article that postulates that the COVID-19 pandemic is linked to the destruction of nature. The number of emerging diseases is rising and this rise is linked to deforestation and species loss. In the article, there are multiple examples of the degradation of ecological systems caused by humans. It is also says that half of the global GDP is moderately or largely dependent on nature. The article concludes that the recovery from the pandemic should be linked to nature recovery.

The forum proposed a plan for a green recovery. The plan includes advancing circular economy. Among the mentioned methods, there is green building, sustainable transport, organic farming, urban open space, renewable energy and electric vehicles.

=== Global Shapers Community ===
The Global Shapers Community (GSC), an initiative of World Economic Forum, selects young leaders below 30 years old to be change agents in the world. Global Shapers develop and lead their city-based hubs to implement social justice projects that advance the mission of World Economic Forum. The GSC has over 10,000 members in 500+ hubs in 154 countries. Some critics see the WEF&#x27;s increasing focus on activist areas such as environmental protection and social entrepreneurship as a strategy to disguise the true plutocratic goals of the organisation.

=== The Great Reset ===

In May 2020, the WEF and the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Sustainable Markets Initiative launched &quot;The Great Reset&quot; project, a five-point plan to enhance sustainable economic growth following the global recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. &quot;The Great Reset&quot; was to be the theme of WEF&#x27;s annual meeting in August 2021.

According to forum founder Schwab, the intention of the project is to reconsider the meaning of capitalism and capital. While not abandoning capitalism, he proposes to change and possibly move on from some aspects of it, including neoliberalism and free-market fundamentalism. The role of corporations, taxation and more should be reconsidered. International cooperation and trade should be defended and the Fourth Industrial Revolution also.

The forum defines the system that it wants to create as &quot;Stakeholder Capitalism&quot;. The forum supports trade unions.

The &#x27;Great Reset&#x27; has also been the target of several debunked conspiracy theories, which heavily overlap with related conspiracy theories concerning the &#x27;New World Order&#x27;, Qanon, and COVID-19.

==Criticism==
===Physical protests===
During the late 1990s, the WEF, as well as the G7, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and International Monetary Fund, came under heavy criticism by anti-globalization activists who asserted that capitalism and globalization were increasing poverty and destroying the environment. In 2000, about 10,000 demonstrators disrupted a regional WEF meeting in Melbourne, by obstructing the path of 200 delegates. Small demonstrations are held in Davos on most but not all years, organised by the local Green Party (see Anti-WEF protests in Switzerland, January 2003) to protest against what have been called the meetings of &quot;fat cats in the snow&quot;, a tongue-in-cheek term used by rock singer Bono.

After 2014, the physical protest movement against the World Economic Forum largely died down, and Swiss police noted a significant decline in attending protesters, 20 at most during the meeting in 2016. While protesters are still more numerous in large Swiss cities, the protest movement itself has undergone significant change. Around 150 Tibetans and Uighurs protested in Geneva and 400 Tibetans in Bern against the visit of China&#x27;s paramount leader Xi Jinping for the 2017 meeting, with subsequent confrontations and arrests.

===Growing gaps in wealth===
A number of NGOs have used the World Economic Forum to highlight growing inequalities and wealth gaps, which they consider to have been neglected, or even to be exacerbated, through institutions like the WEF. Winnie Byanyima, the former executive director of the anti-poverty confederation Oxfam International co-chaired the 2015 meeting, where she presented a critical report of global wealth distribution based on statistical research by the Credit Suisse Research Institute. In this study, the richest 1% of people in the world own 48% of the world&#x27;s wealth. At the 2019 meeting, she presented another report in which she stated that the gap between rich and poor has widened. The report &quot;Public Good or Private Wealth&quot; stated that 2,200 billionaires worldwide saw their wealth grow by 12% while the poorest half saw its wealth fall by 11%. Oxfam calls for a global tax overhaul to increase and harmonise global tax rates for corporations and wealthy individuals.

&quot;You&#x27;ll own nothing and be happy&quot; is a phrase adapted from an essay written by Ida Auken in 2016 for the WEF, pondering a future in which urban residents would rely on shared services for many expensive items such as appliances and vehicles. Shortly after its publication, a commentator for European Digital Rights criticized Auken&#x27;s vision of centralized property ownership as a &quot;benevolent dictatorship&quot;. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the phrase went viral, eliciting strongly negative reactions from mostly conservative but also some left-wing and unaffiliated commentators. Responding to viral social media posts based on the phrase, the WEF denied that it had a goal related to limiting ownership of private property.

Rutger Bregman, a Dutch historian invited to a 2018 WEF panel on inequality, went viral when he suggested that the best way for the attendees to attack inequality was to stop avoiding taxes. Bregman described his motivation, saying &quot;it feels like I’m at a firefighters’ conference and no one’s allowed to speak about water&quot;.

===Formation of a detached elite===
The formation of a detached elite, sometimes labeled with the neologism &quot;Davos Man&quot;, refers to a global group whose members view themselves as completely &quot;international&quot;. The term refers to people who &quot;have little need for national loyalty, view national boundaries as obstacles, and see national governments as residues from the past whose only useful function is to facilitate the elite&#x27;s global operations&quot; according to political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, who is credited with inventing the neologism. In his 2004 article &quot;Dead Souls: The Denationalization of the American Elite&quot;, Huntington argues that this international perspective is a minority elitist position not shared by the nationalist majority of the people. 

The Transnational Institute describes the World Economic Forum&#x27;s main purpose as being &quot;to function as a socializing institution for the emerging global elite, globalization&#x27;s &quot;Mafiocracy&quot; of bankers, industrialists, oligarchs, technocrats and politicians. They promote common ideas, and serve common interests: their own.&quot;

In 2019, the &quot;Manager Magazin&quot; journalist Henrik Müller argued that the &quot;Davos Man&quot; had already decayed into different groups and camps. He sees three central drivers for this development:
* Ideologically: the liberal western model is no longer considered a universal role model that other countries strive for (with China&#x27;s digital totalitarianism or the traditional absolutism in the Persian Gulf as counter-proposals, all of which are represented by government members in Davos).
* Socially: societies increasingly disintegrate into different groups, each of which evokes its own identity (e.g. embodied through the Brexit vote or congressional blockades in the USA).
* Economically: the measured economic reality largely contradicts the established ideas of how the economy should actually work (despite economic upswings, wages and prices e.g. barely rise).

===Public cost of security===

Critics argue that the WEF, despite having reserves of several hundred million Swiss francs and paying its executives salaries of around 1 million Swiss francs per year, would not pay any federal tax and moreover allocate a part of its costs to the public. Following massive criticism from politicians and Swiss civil society, the Swiss federal government decided in February 2021 to reduce its annual contributions to the WEF.

As of 2018, the police and military expenditures carried by the federal government stood at 39 million Swiss francs. The &quot;Aargauer Zeitung&quot; argued in January 2020 that the additional cost borne by the Kanton Graubünden stand at CHF 9 million per year.

The Swiss Green Party summarised their criticism within the Swiss National Council that the holding of the World Economic Forum has cost Swiss taxpayers hundreds of millions of Swiss francs over the past decades. In their view, it was however questionable to what extent the Swiss population or global community benefit from these expenditures.

===Gender debate===

Women have been broadly underrepresented at the WEF, according to some critics. The female participation rate at the WEF increased from 9% to 15% between 2001 and 2005. In 2016, 18% of the WEF attendees were female; this number increased to 21% in 2017, and 24% in 2020.

Several women have since shared their personal impressions of the Davos meetings in media articles, highlighting that issues were more profound than &quot;a quota at Davos for female leaders or a session on diversity and inclusion&quot;. The World Economic Forum has in this context filed legal complaints against at least three investigative articles by reporters Katie Gibbons and Billy Kenber that were published by the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; in March 2020, with the articles still online as of January 2024.
===Workplace discrimination===
According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the WEF has had numerous accusations of workplace discrimination against women and Black people.

===Undemocratic decision making===
According to the European Parliament&#x27;s think tank, critics see the WEF as an instrument for political and business leaders to &quot;take decisions without having to account to their electorate or shareholders&quot;.

Since 2009, the WEF has been working on a project called the Global Redesign Initiative (GRI), which proposes a transition away from intergovernmental decision-making towards a system of multi-stakeholder governance. According to the Transnational Institute (TNI), the Forum is hence planning to replace a recognised democratic model with a model where a self-selected group of &quot;stakeholders&quot; make decisions on behalf of the people.

Some critics have seen the WEF&#x27;s attention to goals like environmental protection and social entrepreneurship as mere window dressing to disguise its true plutocratic nature and goals. In a &quot;Guardian&quot; opinion piece, Cas Mudde said that such plutocrats should not be the group to have control over the political agendas and decide which issues to focus on and how to support them. A writer in the German magazine &quot;Cicero&quot; saw the situation as academic, cultural, media and economic elites grasping for social power while disregarding political decision processes. A materially well-endowed milieu would in this context try to &quot;cement its dominance of opinion and sedate ordinary people with maternalistic-paternalistic social benefits, so that they are not disturbed by the common people when they steer&quot;. The French &quot;Les Echos&quot; furthermore concludes that Davos &quot;represents the exact values people rejected at the ballot box&quot;.

=== Lack of financial transparency ===

In 2017, the former &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; journalist Jürgen Dunsch criticized that financial reports of the WEF were not very transparent since neither income nor expenditures were broken down. In addition, he outlined that the foundation capital was not quantified while the apparently not insignificant profits would be reinvested.

Recent annual reports published by the WEF include a more detailed breakdown of its financials and indicate revenues of CHF 349 million for the year 2019 with reserves of CHF 310 million and a foundation capital of CHF 34 million. There are no further details provided to what asset classes or individual names the WEF allocates its financial assets of CHF 261 million. From July 2019 to June 2020, the World Economic Forum has spent €250,000 on lobbying the European Union.

The German newspaper &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; criticised in this context that the WEF had turned into a &quot;money printing machine&quot;, which is run like a family business and forms a comfortable way to make a living for its key personnel. The foundation&#x27;s founder Klaus Schwab draws a salary of around one million Swiss francs per year.

=== Unclear selection criteria ===

In a request to the Swiss National Council, the Swiss Green Party criticised that invitations to the annual meeting and programmes of the World Economic Forum are issued according to unclear criteria. They highlight that &quot;despots&quot; such as the son of the former Libyan dictator Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi had been invited to the WEF and even awarded membership in the club of &quot;Young Global Leaders&quot;. Even after the beginning of the Arab spring in December 2010 and related violent uprisings against despot regimes, the WEF continued to invite Gaddafi to its annual meeting.

=== Environmental footprint of annual meetings ===
Critics emphasise that the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is counterproductive when combating pressing problems of humanity such as the climate crisis. Even in 2020, participants travelled to the WEF annual meeting in Davos on around 1,300 private jets while the total emissions burden from transport and accommodation were enormous in their view.

=== Corporate capture of global and democratic institutions ===
The World Economic Forum&#x27;s &quot;Global Redesign&quot; report suggests to create &quot;public-private&quot; United Nations (UN) in which selected agencies operate and steer global agendas under shared governance systems.

In September 2019, more than 400 civil society organizations and 40 international networks heavily criticised a partnership agreement between WEF and the United Nations and called on the UN Secretary-General to end it. They see such an agreement as a &quot;disturbing corporate capture of the UN, which moved the world dangerously towards a privatised global governance&quot;. The Dutch Transnational Institute think tank summarises that we are increasingly entering a world where gatherings such as Davos are &quot;a silent global coup d&#x27;état&quot; to capture governance.

=== Non-accreditation of critical media outlets ===
In 2019, the Swiss newspaper &quot;WOZ&quot; received a refusal of its accreditation request for the annual meeting with the editors and subsequently accused the World Economic Forum of favoring specific media outlets. The newspaper highlighted that the WEF stated in its refusal message that it [the Forum] prefers media outlets it works with throughout the year. &quot;WOZ&quot; deputy head Yves Wegelin called this a strange idea of journalism because in &quot;journalism you don&#x27;t necessarily have to work with large corporations, but rather critique them&quot;.

=== Institutional initiatives ===
In addition to economic policy, the WEF&#x27;s agenda is in recent years increasingly focusing on positively connoted activist topics such as environmental protection and social entrepreneurship, which critics see as a strategy to disguise the organisation&#x27;s true plutocratic goals.

In a December 2020 article by &quot;The Intercept&quot;, author Naomi Klein described that the WEF&#x27;s initiatives like the &quot;Great Reset&quot; were simply a &quot;coronavirus-themed rebranding&quot; of things that the WEF was already doing and that it was an attempt by the rich to make themselves look good. In her opinion, &quot;the Great Reset is merely the latest edition of this gilded tradition, barely distinguishable from earlier Davos Big Ideas.

Similarly, in his review of &quot;COVID-19: The Great Reset&quot;, ethicist Steven Umbrello makes parallel critiques of the agenda. He says that the WEF &quot;whitewash[es] a seemingly optimistic future post-Great Reset with buzz words like equity and sustainability&quot; while it functionally jeopardizes those goals.

A study published in the Journal of Consumer Research investigated the sociological impact of the WEF. It concluded that the WEF do not solve issues such as poverty, global warming, chronic illness, or debt. The Forum has, according to the study, simply shifted the burden for the solution of these problems from governments and business to &quot;responsible consumers subjects: the green consumer, the health-conscious consumer, and the financially literate consumer.&quot;

=== Appropriation of global crises ===
In December 2021, the Catholic Cardinal and former Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) Gerhard Ludwig Müller criticised in a controversial interview that people like WEF founder Schwab were sitting &quot;on the throne of their wealth&quot; and were not touched by the everyday difficulties and sufferings people face e.g. due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, such elites would see crises as an opportunity to push through their agendas. He particularly criticised the control such people would exercise on people and their embracement of areas such as transhumanism. The German Central Council of Jews condemned this criticism, which is also linked to Jewish financial investors, as antisemitic.

On the other hand, the WEF has been criticized as &quot;hypocritical&quot; towards Palestinian human rights, when it rejected a petition from its own constituents to condemn Israel&#x27;s aggression against Palestinians. WEF cited the need to remain &quot;impartial&quot; on the issue. However, Khaled Al Sabawi, writing in MondoWeiss called it hypocritical after it voluntarily condemned Russia&#x27;s aggression against Ukraine months later.

==Controversies==
=== Davos municipality ===
In June 2021, WEF founder Klaus Schwab sharply criticised what he characterized as the &quot;profiteering&quot;, &quot;complacency&quot; and &quot;lack of commitment&quot; by the municipality of Davos in relation to the annual meeting. He mentioned that the preparation of the COVID-related meeting in Singapore in 2021/2022 had created an alternative to its Swiss host and sees the chance that the annual meeting will stay in Davos between 40 and 70 per cent.

=== Usage of &quot;Davos&quot; ===
As there are many other international conferences nicknamed with &quot;Davos&quot; such as the &quot;Davos of the Desert&quot; event organised by Saudi Arabia&#x27;s Future Investment Initiative Institute, the World Economic Forum objected to the use of &quot;Davos&quot; in such contexts for any event not organised by them. This particular statement was issued on 22 October 2018, a day before the opening of 2018 Future Investment Initiative (nicknamed &quot;Davos in the desert&quot;) organised by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia.

==Alternatives==
=== Open Forum Davos ===
Since the annual meeting in January 2003 in Davos, an &quot;Open Forum Davos&quot;, which was co-organized by the Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches, is held concurrently with the Davos forum, opening up the debate about globalization to the general public. The Open Forum has been held in the local high school every year, featuring top politicians and business leaders. It is open to all members of the public free of charge.

=== Public Eye Awards ===
The Public Eye Awards have been held every year since 2000. It is a counter-event to the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos. Public Eye Awards is a &quot;public competition of the worst corporations in the world.&quot; In 2011, more than 50,000 people voted for companies that acted irresponsibly. At a ceremony at a Davos hotel, the &quot;winners&quot; in 2011 were named as Indonesian palm oil diesel maker, Neste Oil in Finland, and mining company AngloGold Ashanti in South Africa. According to Schweiz aktuell broadcast on 16 January 2015, a public presence during the WEF 2015, may not be guaranteed because the massively increased security in Davos. The Public Eye Award will be awarded for the last time in Davos: &quot;Public Eyes says Goodbye to Davos&quot;, confirmed by Rolf Marugg (now Landrats politician), by not directly engaged politicians, and by the police responsible.

<doc id="172189" wikidata="Q1338491" url="?curid=172189" title="Schengen Information System">
<text>The Schengen Information System (SIS) is a governmental database maintained by the European Commission. The SIS is used by 31 European countries to find information about individuals and entities for the purposes of national security, border control and law enforcement since 2001. A second technical version of this system, SIS II, went live on 9 April 2013. An upgraded Schengen Information System entered into operation on 7 March 2023.

== Participating nations ==
Information in SIS is shared among the institutions of countries participating in the Schengen Agreement Application Convention (SAAC). The five original participating countries were France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Twenty-two additional countries joined the system since its creation: Spain, Portugal, Italy, Austria, Greece, Finland, Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Liechtenstein, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. Among the current participants, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland are members of the European Free Trade Association but not of the European Union.

Although Ireland and the United Kingdom operate a Common Travel Area and had not signed the Schengen Agreement Application Convention (when the United Kingdom was still an EU member), they had the right to take part in Schengen co-operation under the terms of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Ireland joined the law enforcement aspect on 1 January 2021 and has &quot;full operational capacity&quot; since March 2021. As a consequence of Brexit, the UK lost access to the system on 31 December 2020. (UK law enforcement did 571 million searches in the database in 2019 alone) and does not expect to regain any access before 2027 at the earliest.

== Introduction ==
SIS information is stored according to the legislation of each participating country. There are more than 46 million entries (called &quot;alerts&quot;) in SIS, most about lost identity documents. Person alerts make up around 1.9 percent of the database (about 885,000 records). Each alert contains information such as: name, date of birth, gender, nationality, aliases, arms or history of violence, the reason for the alert and the action to be taken if the person is encountered. SIS does not record travellers&#x27; entries and exits from the Schengen Area.

== History ==
On 25 March 1957, the Treaty of Rome was completed. On 3 February 1958, the economic union of the Benelux countries was formed. Both agreements aimed to enable the free movement of people and goods across national borders. The Benelux countries, as a smaller group, were able to quickly implement the agreement. The European Communities&#x27; focus was on economic integration. It was not until the agreement of Saarbrücken was completed on 13 July 1984, that border controls between France and Germany were eased.

On 14 June 1985, France, Germany and three of the Benelux nations completed the Schengen Agreement. Border controls on people and goods between these nations were gradually relaxed. On 19 June 1990, the initial five nations were joined by Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece, Austria and five Nordic Passport Union countries: Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

On 21 December 2007, the Schengen border-free zone was enlarged to include Estonia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia and Slovenia.

On 1 January 2023, the Schengen border-free zone was enlarged to include Croatia.

== Legal aspects and technical characteristics ==
SIS was created to maintain European security after 25 March 2001 when border security between fifteen nations was relaxed. The SIS requires Schengen nations to respect the legal force of the information it contains. It also requires the nations to respect the privacy and personal freedom of the people whose data is held according to national data laws. SIS&#x27;s information processing system must be permanently connected to member nations&#x27; databases and must be updated in real-time.

These commitments are supplemented by consultation procedures between the member nations. Discussions may take place about issues such as confirmation of information, variation of actions directed by SIS, questions of residency, and international warrants for arrest.

SIS is controlled by an authority composed of representatives of the member nations. Personal data protection is a key responsibility. At a technical level, the participating countries adopted a data-processing star architecture made up of a central site containing the reference database, known as C-SIS, for which the responsibility is entrusted to the French Republic by the CAAS, and a site by country, known as N-SIS, containing a copy of the database.

== Data ==
The type of data about people kept in SIS includes: requests for extradition; undesirability of presence in particular territory; minor age; mental illnesses; missing person status; a need for protection; requests by a judicial authority; and suspected of crime. The SIS also keeps data referring to lost, stolen and misappropriated firearms, identity documents, motor vehicles and banknotes.

Individuals listed in SIS may request data corrections or removal if the entry is incorrect or lacks sufficient justification. Applications must be submitted to the relevant national authority, often requiring supporting documentation such as court rulings or police reports. Processing times vary by country, and legal assistance can improve the chances of success, particularly in complex cases.

France is responsible for management of SIS and uses an automated system of data updates which occur every five minutes. The SIS automatically directs data to queries arriving via large national databases. Each member nation has an office responsible for SIS communications. SIS also has a function called &quot;Supplementary Information Request at the National Entry&quot; (SIRENE). The SIRENE office records a &quot;hit&quot; on a SIS data record and forwards further information to assist investigations.

== Police co-operation and legal mutual assistance ==
In addition to SIS and SIRENE, the Schengen convention ensured police co-operation and legal mutual assistance. Police of member nations can cooperate to prevent and identify crime (article 39); to continue surveillance across borders (article 40); to pursue across borders in certain circumstances (article 41); and to share information that is significant for the repression or the prevention of in flagrante delicto or threats to order and public safety (article 46). This allows execution of criminal judgements and extraditions where a national attempts to take refuge in another territory.

== System evolution ==
In November 2011, SIS1 was renewed for a second time. The main reason for renewal was to connect more nations.

In 2007, while developments were in progress, Portugal had offered the use of a version called &quot;SISone4ALL&quot; developed by SEF (Portugal&#x27;s Border and Foreigners Service) and Critical Software.

On 15 October 2010, Bulgaria and Romania joined SIS II for law enforcement cooperation.

On 9 April 2013, SIS II went live.

On 27 June 2017, Croatia joined SIS II for law enforcement cooperation.

On 1 August 2018, Bulgaria and Romania gained full access to SIS.&lt;ref name=&quot;2018/934&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 January 2021, Ireland joined the law enforcement aspect, with full access to SIS for law enforcement purposes from 15 March 2021.

On 3 May 2022, the European Parliament approved a proposal to give Cyprus full access to SIS. The proposal then needed to be endorsed by the Council of the European Union.

On 1 January 2023, Croatia gained full access to SIS with joining the Schengen border-free zone.

On 25 July 2023, Cyprus gained full access to SIS.

In 2023, the UK was negotiating to rejoin SIS II, with access unlikely before the 2027/2028 fiscal year.

==Brexit==
Use of the Schengen Information System is limited to members of the European Union and signatories of the Schengen Agreement Application Convention. While still a member of the EU but not of the Schengen Agreement, the United Kingdom had limited access to the SIS. This access ceased from 1 January 2021. In June 2020, the Security and Intelligence subcommittee of the House of Lords, on hearing evidence by Home Office Minister James Brokenshire, expressed concerns that failure of the (post-Brexit) trade negotiation between the United Kingdom and the EU could lead to worrying delays in access to counter-terrorism intelligence.

In 2023 the United Kingdom gaining access to EU datasets was stated to be at &quot;a very early stage&quot;, and was not expected to be completed before the 2027/2028 financial year.

<text>Castor oil is a vegetable oil pressed from castor beans, the seeds of the plant &quot;Ricinus communis&quot;. The seeds are 40 to 60 percent oil. It is a colourless or pale yellow liquid with a distinct taste and odor. Its boiling point is and its density is 0.961 g/cm3. It includes a mixture of triglycerides in which about 90 percent of fatty acids are ricinoleates. Oleic acid and linoleic acid are the other significant components.

Some 270,000–360,000 tonnes (600–800 million pounds) of castor oil are produced annually for a variety of uses. Castor oil and its derivatives are used in the manufacturing of soaps, lubricants, hydraulic and brake fluids, paints, dyes, coatings, inks, cold-resistant plastics, waxes and polishes, nylon, and perfumes.

==Etymology==
The name probably comes from a confusion between the &quot;Ricinus&quot; plant that produces it and another plant, the &quot;Vitex agnus-castus&quot;. An alternative etymology, though, suggests that it was used as a replacement for castoreum.

==History==
Use of castor oil as a laxative is attested to in the Ebers Papyrus, and it was in use several centuries earlier. Midwifery manuals from the 19th century recommended castor oil and 10 drops of laudanum for relieving &quot;false pains.&quot;

==Composition==

Castor oil is well known as a source of ricinoleic acid, a monounsaturated, 18-carbon fatty acid. Among fatty acids, ricinoleic acid is unusual in that it has a hydroxyl functional group on the 12th carbon atom. This functional group causes ricinoleic acid (and castor oil) to be more polar than most fats. The chemical reactivity of the alcohol group also allows chemical derivatization that is not possible with most other seed oils.

Because of its ricinoleic acid content, castor oil is a valuable chemical in feedstocks, commanding a higher price than other seed oils. As an example, in July 2007, Indian castor oil sold for about US$0.90/kg ($0.41/lb), whereas U.S. soybean, sunflower, and canola oils sold for about $0.30/kg ($0.14/lb).


==Human uses==
Castor oil has been used orally to relieve constipation or to evacuate the bowel before intestinal surgery. The laxative effect of castor oil is attributed to ricinoleic acid, which is produced by hydrolysis in the small intestine. Use of castor oil for simple constipation is medically discouraged because it may cause violent diarrhea.

===Food and preservative===
In the food industry, food-grade castor oil is used in food additives, flavorings, candy (e.g., polyglycerol polyricinoleate in chocolate), as a mold inhibitor, and in packaging. Polyoxyethylated castor oil (e.g., Kolliphor EL) is also used in the food industries. In India, Pakistan, and Nepal, food grains are preserved by the application of castor oil. It stops rice, wheat, and pulses from rotting. For example, the legume pigeon pea is commonly available coated in oil for extended storage.

=== Emollient ===

Castor oil has been used in cosmetic products included in creams and as a moisturizer. It is often combined with zinc oxide to form an emollient and astringent, zinc and castor oil cream, which is commonly used to treat infants for nappy rash.

=== Medicine ===
Castor oil is used as a vehicle for serums administering steroid hormones such as estradiol valerate via intramuscular or subcutaneous injection.

=== Alternative medicine ===
Despite the lack of evidence, castor oil is sometimes claimed to be able to cure diseases. According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;available scientific evidence does not support claims that castor oil on the skin cures cancer or any other disease.&quot;

=== Childbirth ===

Despite some undesirable side effects, castor oil is used for labor induction. There is no high-quality research proving that ingestion of castor oil results in cervical ripening or induction of labor; there is, however, evidence that taking it causes nausea and diarrhea. A systematic review of &quot;three trials, involving 233 women, found there has not been enough research done to show the effects of castor oil on ripening the cervix or inducing labour or compare it to other methods of induction. The review found that all women who took castor oil by mouth felt nauseous. More research is needed into the effects of castor oil to induce labour.&quot; Castor oil is still used for labor induction in environments where modern drugs are not available; a review of pharmacologic, mechanical, and &quot;complementary&quot; methods of labor induction published in 2024 by the &quot;American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot; stated that castor oil&#x27;s physiological effect is poorly understood but &quot;given gastrointestinal symptomatology, a prostaglandin mediation has been suggested but not confirmed.&quot; According to &quot;Drugs in Pregnancy and Lactation: A Reference Guide to Fetal and Neonatal Risk&quot; (2008), castor oil should not be ingested or used topically by pre-term pregnant women. There is no data on the potential toxicity of castor oil for nursing mothers.

=== Punishment ===

Since children commonly strongly dislike the taste of castor oil, some parents punished children with a dose of it. Physicians recommended against the practice because it may associate medicines with punishment and make children afraid of the doctor.

=== Use in torture ===
A heavy dose of castor oil could be used as a humiliating punishment for adults. Colonial officials used it in the British Raj (India) to deal with recalcitrant servants. 
Belgian military officials prescribed heavy doses of castor oil in Belgian Congo as a punishment for being too sick to work. Castor oil was also a tool of punishment favored by the Falangist and later Francoist Spain during and following the Spanish Civil War. Its use as a form of gendered violence to repress women was especially prominent. 
This began during the war where Nationalist forces would specifically target Republican-aligned women, both troops and civilians, who lived in Republican-controlled areas. 
The forced drinking of castor oil occurred alongside sexual assault, rape, torture and murder of these women. Its most notorious use as punishment came in Fascist Italy under Benito Mussolini. It was a favorite tool used by the Blackshirts to intimidate and humiliate their opponents. 
Political dissidents were force-fed large quantities of castor oil by fascist squads so as to induce bouts of extreme diarrhea in the victims. This technique was said to have been originated by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio or Italo Balbo. This form of torture was potentially deadly, as the administration of the castor oil was often combined with nightstick beatings, especially to the rear, so that the resulting diarrhea would not only lead to dangerous dehydration but also infect the open wounds from the beatings. However, even those victims who survived had to bear the humiliation of the laxative effects resulting from excessive consumption of the oil.

==Industrial uses==

===Coatings===
Castor oil is used as a biobased polyol in the polyurethane industry. The average functionality (number of hydroxyl groups per triglyceride molecule) of castor oil is 2.7, so it is widely used as a rigid polyol and in coatings. 
One particular use is in a polyurethane concrete where a castor-oil emulsion is reacted with an isocyanate (usually polymeric methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) and a cement and construction aggregate. This is applied fairly thickly as a slurry, which is self-levelling. This base is usually further coated with other systems to build a resilient floor. Castor oil is not a drying oil, meaning that it has a low reactivity with air compared with oils such as linseed oil and tung oil. However, dehydration of castor oil yields linoleic acids, which do have drying properties. 
In this process, the OH group on the ricinoleic acid along with a hydrogen from the next carbon atom are removed, forming a double bond which then has oxidative cross-linking properties and yields the drying oil. It is considered a vital raw material.

===Chemical precursor===
Castor oil can react with other materials to produce other chemical compounds that have numerous applications. 
Transesterification followed by steam cracking gives undecylenic acid, a precursor to specialized polymer nylon 11, and heptanal, a component in fragrances. 
Breakdown of castor oil in strong base gives 2-octanol, both a fragrance component and a specialized solvent, and the dicarboxylic acid sebacic acid. Hydrogenation of castor oil saturates the alkenes, giving a waxy lubricant. 
Castor oil may be epoxidized by reacting the OH groups with epichlorohydrin to make the triglycidyl ether of castor oil which is useful in epoxy technology. 
This is available commercially as Heloxy 505.

The production of lithium grease consumes a significant amount of castor oil. Hydrogenation and saponification of castor oil yields 12-hydroxystearic acid, which is then reacted with lithium hydroxide or lithium carbonate to give high-performance lubricant grease.

Since it has a relatively high dielectric constant (4.7), highly refined and dried castor oil is sometimes used as a dielectric fluid within high-performance, high-voltage capacitors.

===Lubrication===

Vegetable oils such as castor oil are typically unattractive alternatives to petroleum-derived lubricants because of their poor oxidative stability. Castor oil has better low-temperature viscosity properties and high-temperature lubrication than most vegetable oils, making it useful as a lubricant in jet, diesel, and racing engines. The viscosity of castor oil at 10 °C is 2,420 centipoise, but it tends to form gums in a short time, so its usefulness is limited to engines that are regularly rebuilt, such as racing engines. Lubricant company Castrol took its name from castor oil.

Castor oil has been suggested as a lubricant for bicycle pumps because it does not degrade natural rubber seals.

====Turkey red oil====
Turkey red oil, also called sulphonated (or sulfated) castor oil, is made by adding sulfuric acid to vegetable oils, most notably castor oil. It was the first synthetic detergent after ordinary soap. It is used in formulating lubricants, softeners, and dyeing assistants.

====Biodiesel====
Castor oil, like currently less expensive vegetable oils, can be used as feedstock in the production of biodiesel. The resulting fuel is superior for cold winters, because of its exceptionally low cloud point and pour point.

Initiatives to grow more castor for energy production, in preference to other oil crops, are motivated by social considerations. Tropical subsistence farmers would gain a cash crop.

===Early aviation and aeromodelling===
Castor oil was the preferred lubricant for rotary engines, such as the Gnome engine after that engine&#x27;s widespread adoption for aviation in Europe in 1909. It was used almost universally in rotary-engined Allied aircraft in World War I. Germany had to make do with inferior &quot;ersatz&quot; oil for its rotary engines, which resulted in poor reliability.

The methanol-fueled, two-cycle, glow-plug engines used for aeromodelling, since their adoption by model airplane hobbyists in the 1940s, have used varying percentages of castor oil as lubricants. It is highly resistant to degradation when the engine has its fuel-air mixture leaned for maximum engine speed. Gummy residues can still be a problem for aeromodelling powerplants lubricated with castor oil, however, usually requiring eventual replacement of ball bearings when the residue accumulates within the engine&#x27;s bearing races. One British manufacturer of sleeve valved four-cycle model engines has stated the &quot;varnish&quot; created by using castor oil in small percentages can improve the pneumatic seal of the sleeve valve, improving such an engine&#x27;s performance over time.

==Safety==
The castor seed contains ricin, a toxic lectin. Heating during the oil extraction process denatures and deactivates the lectin. Harvesting castor beans, though, may not be without risk. The International Castor Oil Association FAQ document states that castor beans contain an allergenic compound called CB1A. This chemical is described as being virtually nontoxic, but has the capacity to affect people with hypersensitivity. The allergen may be neutralized by treatment with a variety of alkaline agents. The allergen is not present in the castor oil itself.

<text>Rubber bullets (also called rubber baton rounds) are a type of baton round. Despite the name, rubber bullets typically have either a metal core with a rubber coating, or are a homogeneous admixture with rubber being a minority component. Although they are considered a less lethal alternative to metal projectiles, rubber bullets can still cause fatal injuries as well as other serious injuries such as blindness or other permanent disabilities.

Like other similar projectiles made from plastic, wax, and wood, rubber bullets may be used for short range practice and animal control, but are most commonly used in riot control and to disperse protests.

Rubber bullets were invented by the British Ministry of Defence for riot control purposes in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, and were first used there in 1970.

Rubber projectiles have largely been replaced by other materials, as rubber tends to bounce uncontrollably.

==Composition and physical properties==
Analysis of the composition of the &quot;rubber&quot; pellets used by Chilean police shows that 80% of the pellets is made up of hard substances, chiefly silica and barium sulfate, while rubber makes up 20%. The measured hardness of the &quot;rubber&quot; pellets is 96.5 shore A. The hardness of the pellets explain why &quot;exploded eyes&quot; were so common in the 2019–2020 Chilean protests.

== Uses ==

=== Riot control ===


The British Ministry of Defence developed rubber rounds—the &quot;Round, Anti-Riot, 1.5in Baton&quot;—in 1970 for riot control purposes in Northern Ireland during The Troubles. A low power propelling charge gave them a muzzle velocity of about and maximum range of about .&quot;The round is generally deployed in low trajectories or skip fired in the general direction (non-target specific) of the intended targets,&quot; causing pain but not injury, but is also intended to be direct fired at the discretion of the operator. From 1970 to 1975, about 55,000 rubber bullets were fired by the British Army in Northern Ireland. The bullets were intended to be fired at the legs of rioters or the ground in front of rioters where it would bounce, losing some of its velocity, and then hit the intended target. However, rubber bullets were often fired by security forces directly at people from close range, resulting in a number of individuals being killed or wounded. Humans rights campaigner and co-founder of United Campaign Against Plastic Bullets Emma Groves was blinded by a rubber bullet in 1971. In 1975, they were replaced by plastic bullets. In Northern Ireland over 35 years (1970–2005), about 125,000 rubber and plastic bullets were fired—an average of ten per day—causing 17 deaths.

The baton round was made available to British police forces outside Northern Ireland from 2001. In 2013 however, Ministry of Defence papers declassified from 1977 revealed it was aware rubber bullets were more dangerous than was publicly disclosed. The documents contained legal advice for the MoD to seek a settlement over a child who had been blinded in 1972, rather than go to court which would expose problems with the bullets and make it harder to fight future related cases. The papers stated that further tests would reveal serious problems with the bullets, including that they were tested &quot;in a shorter time than was ideal&quot;, that they &quot;could be lethal&quot; and that they &quot;could and did cause serious injuries&quot;.

Israeli rubber bullets are produced in two main types. The older type, the standard rubber bullet, is a steel sphere coated in a thin layer of rubber, weighing 14 grams, while the newly improved rubber bullet, introduced in 1989, is a rubber-coated metal cylinder 1.7 cm in diameter, weighing 15.4grams. Of the lethal injuries from this projectile, most are suffered to the head.

Smaller rubber bullets are used in riot shotguns and are available in a variety of types. One company, for example, makes both rubber buckshot rounds, containing fifteen 8.3mm diameter rubber balls per cartridge, and rubber baton rounds, containing a single 4.75 gram projectile.
Israeli security forces used less-lethal weapons including rubber bullets in an operation on 28 February 2011 to demolish illegal structures in the West Bank settlement of Havat Gilad.

=== Self-defence ===
In some countries, less-lethal guns that fire rubber projectiles may be used by civilians for self-defence.
* – Private security guards are allowed to carry less-lethal gas pistols with the ability to fire rubber bullets for the purpose of self defence.
* – Rubber bullet guns can be owned in the country by private individuals &quot;for the purpose of self-defence.&quot;
* – Since 1999, the civil population, private security officers, and law control forces in Russia are permitted to use less-lethal weapons. A variety of handguns (Osa, Makarych, Horhe, etc.) are carried with specially weakened construction and barrel with internal lugs, making use of full-power loads and/or firing hard projectiles impossible, while rubber bullets just compress when passing the lug and so may be fired. Most common calibres are 9 mm and 10 mm with muzzle velocity sometimes almost matching normal handguns and bullets as light as 0.7 g.
* – Security guards may use less-lethal gas pistols with the ability to fire ammunition with rubber bullets.

=== Recreation ===
Rubber bullets, powered only by primer, are usually used for short-range indoor target practice or training, generally with handguns. They are intended only for target shooting, unlike paintballs or airsoft pellets, which are intended for use on suitably protected live targets. Rubber bullets, if used with a suitable backstop, can be recovered undamaged after firing, and reused many times.

<doc id="172199" wikidata="Q240950" url="?curid=172199" title="Faltings's theorem">
<text>Faltings&#x27;s theorem is a result in arithmetic geometry, according to which a curve of genus greater than 1 over the field formula_1 of rational numbers has only finitely many rational points. This was conjectured in 1922 by Louis Mordell, and known as the Mordell conjecture until its 1983 proof by Gerd Faltings. The conjecture was later generalized by replacing formula_1 by any number field.

==Background==
Let formula_3 be a non-singular algebraic curve of genus formula_4 over formula_1. Then the set of rational points on formula_3 may be determined as follows:
* When formula_7, there are either no points or infinitely many. In such cases, formula_3 may be handled as a conic section.
* When formula_9, if there are any points, then formula_3 is an elliptic curve and its rational points form a finitely generated abelian group. (This is &quot;Mordell&#x27;s Theorem&quot;, later generalized to the Mordell–Weil theorem.) Moreover, Mazur&#x27;s torsion theorem restricts the structure of the torsion subgroup.
* When formula_11, according to Faltings&#x27;s theorem, formula_3 has only a finite number of rational points.

==Proofs==
Igor Shafarevich conjectured that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of abelian varieties of fixed dimension and fixed polarization degree over a fixed number field with good reduction outside a fixed finite set of places. Aleksei Parshin showed that Shafarevich&#x27;s finiteness conjecture would imply the Mordell conjecture, using what is now called Parshin&#x27;s trick. 

Gerd Faltings proved Shafarevich&#x27;s finiteness conjecture using a known reduction to a case of the Tate conjecture, together with tools from algebraic geometry, including the theory of Néron models. The main idea of Faltings&#x27;s proof is the comparison of Faltings heights and naive heights via Siegel modular varieties.

===Later proofs===
* Paul Vojta gave a proof based on Diophantine approximation. Enrico Bombieri found a more elementary variant of Vojta&#x27;s proof.
*Brian Lawrence and Akshay Venkatesh gave a proof based on -adic Hodge theory, borrowing also some of the easier ingredients of Faltings&#x27;s original proof.

==Consequences==
Faltings&#x27;s 1983 paper had as consequences a number of statements which had previously been conjectured:

* The &quot;Mordell conjecture&quot; that a curve of genus greater than 1 over a number field has only finitely many rational points;
* The &quot;Isogeny theorem&quot; that abelian varieties with isomorphic Tate modules (as formula_13-modules with Galois action) are isogenous.

A sample application of Faltings&#x27;s theorem is to a weak form of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem: for any fixed formula_14 there are at most finitely many primitive integer solutions (pairwise coprime solutions) to formula_15, since for such formula_16 the Fermat curve formula_17 has genus greater than 1.

==Generalizations==
Because of the Mordell–Weil theorem, Faltings&#x27;s theorem can be reformulated as a statement about the intersection of a curve formula_3 with a finitely generated subgroup formula_19 of an abelian variety formula_20. Generalizing by replacing formula_20 by a semiabelian variety, formula_3 by an arbitrary subvariety of formula_20, and formula_19 by an arbitrary finite-rank subgroup of formula_20 leads to the Mordell–Lang conjecture, which was proved in 1995 by McQuillan following work of Laurent, Raynaud, Hindry, Vojta, and Faltings.

Another higher-dimensional generalization of Faltings&#x27;s theorem is the Bombieri–Lang conjecture that if formula_26 is a pseudo-canonical variety (i.e., a variety of general type) over a number field formula_27, then formula_28 is not Zariski dense in formula_26. Even more general conjectures have been put forth by Paul Vojta.

The Mordell conjecture for function fields was proved by Yuri Ivanovich Manin and by Hans Grauert. In 1990, Robert F. Coleman found and fixed a gap in Manin&#x27;s proof.

<text>The Rhodes Scholarship is an international postgraduate award for students to study at the University of Oxford in Oxford, United Kingdom. The scholarship is open to people from all backgrounds around the world. 

Established in 1902, it is one of the oldest graduate scholarships in the world and one of the most prestigious international scholarship programs. Its founder, Cecil John Rhodes, wanted to promote unity among English-speaking nations and instill a sense of civic-minded leadership and moral fortitude in future leaders, irrespective of their chosen career paths. 

The scholarship committee selects candidates based on a combination of literary and academic achievements, athletic involvement, character traits like truth and courage, and leadership potential, originally assessed on a 200-point scale. In 2018, the criteria were revised to emphasize using one&#x27;s talents and caring for others. The American Rhodes Scholarship is highly competitive, with an acceptance rate of around four percent in recent years, while other countries have varying rates. Scholars can study full-time postgraduate courses at Oxford for one to three years, receiving financial support for tuition and living expenses, along with access to Rhodes House facilities.

The Rhodes Scholarship has faced controversies since its inception, primarily concerning the exclusion of women and Black Africans. Initially, the scholarship was limited to male students with Commonwealth of Nations, Germany, and the United States, a restriction that only changed in 1977 following the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act. Protests for the inclusion of non-white scholars began in the 1970s, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1991 that Black South Africans were awarded the scholarship due to the political changes in the country. Additionally, criticism of Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s colonialist legacy has spurred movements calling for a reevaluation of the scholarship and its ties to Rhodes&#x27;s views. Critics have also highlighted the tendency of recipients to pursue careers in business rather than public service, diverging from the scholarship&#x27;s original intent. In 2007, some criticized Oxford&#x27;s postgraduate education as outdated, further igniting debate over the quality of education and the scholarship&#x27;s value. 

Rhodes Scholars have pursued diverse careers across various fields, including education, law, business, and medicine, often achieving respectable positions. Many have engaged in social justice, human rights advocacy, and civil rights work. In the medical and scientific communities, they have contributed to advancements in genetics, disease research, and surgical techniques. Notable scholars include former heads of state, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and influential activists. Additionally, some have made significant contributions to literature, arts, and technology, influencing culture and scientific understanding.

== History ==
=== Founding and motivation ===
Numerous international scholarship programs were very much underway by 1900. Since the 1880s, governments, universities, and individuals in the settler colonies had been establishing travelling scholarships to home universities. By 1900, the travelling scholarship had become an important part of settler universities&#x27; educational visions. It served as a crucial mechanism by which they sought to claim their citizenship of what they saw as the expansive British academic world. The Rhodes program was a copy of others that soon became the best-known version. The Rhodes Trust established the scholarships in 1902 under the terms laid out in the eighth and final will of Cecil John Rhodes, dated 1 July 1899 and appended by several codicils through March 1902.

The scholarships were founded for two reasons: to promote unity within the British empire, and to strengthen diplomatic ties between Britain and the United States of America. In Rhodes&#x27;s own words, &quot;I…desire to encourage and foster an appreciation of the advantages which I implicitly believe will result from the union of the English-speaking peoples throughout the world and to encourage in the students from North America who would benefit from the American Scholarships.&quot; Rhodes also bequeathed scholarships to German students in the hope that, &quot;a good understanding between England, Germany and the United States of America will secure the peace of the world.&quot;

Rhodes, who attended Oriel College, Oxford, believed the university&#x27;s residential colleges would be the best venue to nurture diplomatic ties between future world leaders.

To this day, controversies persist over Rhodes&#x27;s Anglo-supremacist beliefs, most of which date back to his 1877 confession of faith. However, such convictions did not play a part in the final vision for the scholarship. The scholarships are based on Rhodes&#x27;s final will and testament, which states that &quot;no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election…on account of his race or religious opinions&quot;.

The Rhodes Scholarships are administered and awarded by the Rhodes Trust, which is located at Rhodes House in Oxford. The trust has been modified by four acts of Parliament: the Rhodes Estate Act 1916, the Rhodes Trust Act 1929, the Rhodes Trust Act 1946; and most recently by the Rhodes Trust (Modification) Order 1976, a statutory instrument in accordance with Section 78 (4) of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975.

=== After Rhodes&#x27;s death ===

=== 20th century ===
In 1925, the Commonwealth Fund Fellowships (later renamed the Harkness Fellowships) were established to reciprocate the Rhodes Scholarships by enabling British graduates to study in the United States. The Kennedy Scholarship program, created in 1966 as a memorial to John F. Kennedy, adopts a comparable selection process to the Rhodes Scholarships to allow ten British post-graduate students per year to study at either Harvard or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). In 1953, the Parliament of the United Kingdom created the Marshall Scholarship as a coeducational alternative to the Rhodes Scholarship that would serve as a &quot;living gift&quot; to the United States.

Cecil Rhodes wished current scholars and Rhodes alumni (in the words of his will) to have &quot;opportunities of meeting and discussing their experiences and prospects&quot;. This has been reflected, for example, in the initiation by the first warden (Sir Francis Wylie), of an annual warden&#x27;s Christmas letter (now supplemented by Rhodes e-news and other communications); the creation of alumni associations in several countries, most prominently the Association of American Rhodes Scholars (which publishes &quot;The American Oxonian&quot;, founded in 1914, and oversees the Eastman Professorship); and the holding of reunions for Rhodes Scholars of all countries.

In recognition of the centenary of the foundation of the Rhodes Trust in 2003, four former Rhodes Scholars were awarded honorary degrees by the University of Oxford. These were John Brademas, Bob Hawke (Western Australia and University 1953), Rex Nettleford and David R. Woods. During the centenary celebrations, the foundation of the Mandela Rhodes Foundation was also marked.

=== 21st century ===
In 2013, during the 110th Rhodes anniversary celebrations, John McCall MacBain, Marcy McCall MacBain and the McCall MacBain Foundation donated £75 million towards the fundraising efforts of the Rhodes Trust.

In 2015, Rhodes Scholar R. W. Johnson published a critical account of the decline of the Rhodes Trust under its warden, John Rowett, and commended its recovery under wardens Donald Markwell and Charles R. Conn.

As of 2018, due to the introduction of the Global Rhodes Scholarships, the Rhodes Scholarship is open to postgraduate students from anywhere in the world. Many of its greatest scholars have carried out its founder&#x27;s later ideal of &quot;equal rights for all civilized men&quot; becoming some of the foremost voices in human rights and social justice. Some have even engaged in criticism of Cecil Rhodes himself (see Rhodes must fall). Because access to further education, particularly post-graduate education, is linked with social mobility and racial wealth disparity, the scholarship (which is for post-graduate students) continues to attract criticism; however, the scholarship&#x27;s recent partnership with the Atlantic Philanthropies is intended to help address those issues.

In 2019, University of Tennessee graduate Hera Jay Brown became the first transgender woman to be selected for a Rhodes Scholarship. Two non-binary scholars were also selected for the 2020 class.

== Selection and selectivity ==

=== Selection criteria ===
Since 2018, the same criteria Rhodes specified in his will underwent revision and has remained in place:
*literary and scholastic attainments
*energy to use one&#x27;s talents to the full
*truth, courage, devotion to duty, sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness and fellowship
*moral force of character and instincts to lead, and to take an interest in one&#x27;s fellow beings

Each country&#x27;s scholarship varies in its selectivity. In the United States, applicants must first pass a university-internal endorsement process, then proceed to one of the 16 U.S. districts committees. In 2020, approximately 2,300 students sought their institution&#x27;s endorsement for the American Rhodes scholarship, among those 953 from 288 institutions were university-endorsed, of whom 32 were ultimately elected. This represents a 1.4% award rate when considering both endorsed and non-endorsed applicants and a 3.4% award rate when considering endorsed applicants. As such, the American Rhodes Scholarship is more selective than the Churchill Scholarship, Truman Scholarship, Fulbright Scholarship, and Mitchell Scholarship. It is approximately as selective as the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, which has an award rate of 1.3%, and the Marshall Scholarship, which similarly receives around 1,000 university-endorsed applicants, of whom several dozen are ultimately elected. In Canada between 1997 and 2002, there were an average of 234 university-endorsed applicants annually for 11 scholarships, for an acceptance rate of 4.7%. In addition, Canadian provinces differ widely in the number of applications received, with Ontario receiving 58 applications on average for 2 spots (3.4%) and Newfoundland and Labrador receiving 18 applications for 1 spot (5.7%). According to the Rhodes Trust, the overall global acceptance rate stands at 0.7%, making it one of the most competitive scholarships in the world.

An early change was the elimination of the scholarships for Germany during the First and Second World Wars. No German scholars were chosen from 1914 to 1929, nor from 1940 to 1969. A change occurred in 1929, when an Act of Parliament established a fund separate from the original proceeds of Rhodes&#x27;s will and made it possible to expand the number of scholarships. Between 1993 and 1995, scholarships were extended to other countries in the European Community.

=== Scholarship terms ===
Rhodes Scholars may study any full-time postgraduate course offered by the university, whether a taught master&#x27;s program, a research degree, or a second undergraduate degree (senior status). The scholarship&#x27;s basic tenure is two years. However, it may also be held for one year or three years. Applications for a third year are considered during the course of the second year. University and college fees are paid by the Rhodes Trust. In addition, scholars receive a monthly maintenance stipend to cover accommodation and living expenses. Although all scholars become affiliated with a residential college while at Oxford, they also enjoy access to the publicly-accessible Rhodes House, an early 20th-century mansion with numerous public rooms, gardens, a library, study areas, and other facilities.

== Allocation of scholarships ==
There were originally 60 scholarships.

Four South African boys&#x27; schools were mentioned in Rhodes&#x27;s will, each to receive an annual scholarship: the Boys High School in Stellenbosch (today known as Paul Roos Gymnasium); the Diocesan College (Bishops) in Rondebosch; the South African College Schools (SACS) in Newlands; and St Andrew&#x27;s College in Grahamstown. These have subsequently been opened also to former students of their partner schools (girls&#x27; or co-educational schools).

During the ensuing 100 years, the trustees have added about another 40 scholarships at one time or another, though not all have continued. Some of these extended the scheme to Commonwealth countries not mentioned in the will. A more detailed allocation by region by year can be found at Rhodes Scholarship Allocations. Very brief summaries of some of the terms and conditions can be found on the trust&#x27;s website. Complete details can be obtained from the nominating countries.

As of 2018, scholars are selected from over 20 Rhodes constituencies (64 countries) worldwide. In 2015, the Rhodes Scholarship extended into new territories, first with the announcement of a number of scholarships for China, later with the announcement of one to two scholarships per year for the United Arab Emirates. The organization administering the scholarships is preparing to begin naming scholars from China. The move into China is the biggest expansion since women became eligible in the 1970s.

==Controversies==

=== Exclusion of women ===
The Rhodes Scholarship was originally, as per the language used in Rhodes&#x27;s will, open only to &quot;male students.&quot; That stipulation did not change until 1977. Rhodes developed his scholarships partly through conversation with William Thomas Stead, editor of &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot; and confidant of Rhodes, and at one time an executor of the Will who was stricken from the role when he objected to Rhodes&#x27;s ill-fated effort to seize the Transvaal. Shortly after Rhodes&#x27;s death, Stead implied in a published article about the Will that he suggested that Rhodes open the scholarships to women, but Rhodes refused. Nothing more is said on the matter.

After his death, the will was under the control of the Board of Trustees of the Rhodes Trust. In 1916, however, the trustees introduced a bill into the House of Commons that, catering to popular British sentiment during the War, &quot;revoked and annulled&quot; the scholarships for Germans. Since then, legal control over the will has resided with Parliament.

In 1970, the trustees established the Rhodes Visiting Fellowships. Unlike the regular scholarship, a Visiting Fellow was expected to have a doctorate or comparable degree, and to use the two-year funded study to engage in independent research. Only 33 Visiting Fellowships were awarded.

In 1975, Parliament passed the Sex Discrimination Act of 1975 that banned discrimination based on sex, including in education. The trustees then applied to the Secretary of State for Education to admit women into the scholarship, and in 1976 the request was granted. In 1977, women were finally admitted to the full scholarship.

Before Parliament passed the 1975 Act, some universities protested against the exclusion of women by nominating female candidates, who were later disqualified at the state level of the American competition. In 1977, the first year women were eligible, 24 women (out of 72 total scholars) were selected worldwide, with 13 women and 19 men selected from the United States. Since then, the average female share of the scholarship in the United States has been around 35 percent.

In 2007, the Association of American Rhodes Scholars published a retrospective on the first 30 years of female recipients, many of whom individually recounted personal experiences as well as professional accomplishments.

In his 2008 book &quot;Legacy: Cecil Rhodes, the Rhodes Trust and Rhodes Scholarship&quot; (Yale University Press), biographer and historian Philip Ziegler writes that &quot;The advent of women does not seem notably to have affected the balance of Scholars among the various professions, though it has reduced the incidence of worldly success.&quot; Although it is true that female recipients have not become heads of state yet, they have succeeded in many other ways as described in the Rhodes Project.

In South Africa, the will of Cecil Rhodes expressly allocated scholarships to four all-male private schools. In 1992, one of the four schools partnered with an all-girls school in order to allow female applicants. In 2012, the three remaining schools followed suit to allow women to apply. Today, four of the nine scholarships allocated to South Africa are open only to students and alumni of these schools and partner schools.

=== Exclusion of Black Africans ===
Beginning in 1970, scholars began protesting against the fact that all Rhodes Scholars from southern Africa were white, with 120 Oxford dons and 80 of the 145 Rhodes Scholars in residence at the time signing a petition calling for non-white scholars to be elected in 1971. The case of South Africa was especially difficult to resolve, because in his will establishing the scholarships, unlike for other constituencies, Rhodes specifically allocated four scholarships to alumni of four white-only private secondary schools. According to Schaeper and Schaeper, the issue became &quot;explosive&quot; in the 1970s and 1980s as scholars argued that the scholarship be changed while the trustees argued they were powerless to change the will. Despite such protests, only in 1991 with the rise of the African National Congress did black South Africans begin to win the scholarships.

Out of five thousand Rhodes Scholarships awarded between 1903 and 1990, about nine hundred went to students from Africa.

=== Criticism of Rhodes as colonialist ===
Public criticism of the scholarship has also focused on Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s white supremacist views. For example, in 1966, regional committees in interviews asked a white American candidate to assure them he would not publicly belittle the scholarship after he referred to its founding on &quot;blood money&quot;. In 2015, a South African Rhodes Scholar, Ntokozo Qwabe, began a campaign to address Rhodes&#x27;s controversial historical and political legacy, with a focus on Qwabe&#x27;s own views which included such statements as &quot;dismantling the open glorification of colonial genocide in educational and other public spaces – which makes it easy for British people to believe that these genocides were &#x27;not that bad&#x27; – and props up the continuing structural legacies of British colonialism, neocolonialism, and ongoing imperialism&quot;. 

Among other things, the campaign called for the removal of a statue of Rhodes from Oriel College and changes to Oxford&#x27;s curriculum. While the college agreed to review the placement of the statue, the Chancellor of the university, Lord Patten, was critical of the accuracy of Qwabe&#x27;s statements and warned against &quot;pandering to contemporary views.&quot;

A group of Rhodes Scholars also created the group Redress Rhodes whose mission was to &quot;attain a more critical, honest, and inclusive reflection of the legacy of Cecil John Rhodes&quot; and to &quot;make reparative justice a more central theme for Rhodes Scholars.&quot; Their demands include, among other things, shifting the Rhodes Scholarships awarded exclusively to previously all-white South African schools (rather than the at-large national pool), dedicating a &quot;space at Rhodes House for the critical engagement with Cecil Rhodes&#x27;s legacy, as well as imperial history&quot;, and ending a ceremonial toast Rhodes Scholars make to the founder. While the group does not have a position on the removal of the statue, its co-founder has called for the scholarship to be renamed as it is &quot;the ultimate form of veneration and colonial apologism; it&#x27;s a large part of why many continue to understand Rhodes as a benevolent founder and benefactor.&quot;

Public criticism has also focused on the alleged hypocrisy of applying for and accepting the Rhodes Scholarship while criticizing it, with University of Cambridge academic Mary Beard, writing in &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, arguing that Scholars &quot;[could not] have your cake and eat it here: I mean you can&#x27;t whitewash Rhodes out of history, but go on using his cash.&quot; Reacting to this criticism, Qwabe replied that &quot;all that [Rhodes] looted must absolutely be returned immediately. I&#x27;m no beneficiary of Rhodes. I&#x27;m a beneficiary of the resources and labor of my people which Rhodes pillaged and slaved.&quot; 

A group of 198 Rhodes Scholars of various years later signed a statement supporting Qwabe and arguing that there was &quot;no hypocrisy in being a recipient of a Rhodes scholarship and being publicly critical of Cecil Rhodes and his legacy—a legacy that continues to alienate, silence, exclude and dehumanize in unacceptable ways. There is no clause that binds us to find &#x27;the good&#x27; in Rhodes&#x27;s character, nor to sanitize the imperialist, colonial agenda he propagated.&quot;

=== Criticism over recipients not entering public service ===
The tendency of a growing number of Rhodes Scholars to enter business or private law, as opposed to public service for which the scholarship was intended, has been a source of frequent criticism and &quot;occasional embarrassment.&quot; Writing in 2009, the Secretary of the Rhodes Trust criticised the trend of Rhodes Scholars to pursue careers in finance and business, noting that &quot;more than twice as many [now] went into business in just one year than did in the entire 1970s&quot;, attributing it to &quot;grotesque&quot; remuneration offered by such occupations. At least a half dozen 1990s Rhodes Scholars became partners at Goldman Sachs and, since the 1980s, McKinsey has had numerous Rhodes Scholars as partners. Similarly, of Rhodes Scholars who became attorneys, about one-third serve as staff attorneys for private corporations, while another third remain in private practice or academic posts.

According to Schaeper and Schaeper, &quot;From 1904 to the present, the program&#x27;s critics have had two main themes: first, that too many scholars were content with comfortable, safe jobs in academe, in law, and in business; second, that too few had careers in government or other fields where public service was the number-one goal.&quot; Andrew Sullivan wrote in 1988 that &quot;of the 1,900 or so living American scholars…about 250 fill middle-rank administrative and professorial positions in middle-rank state colleges and universities…[while] another 260...have ended up as lawyers.&quot;

=== Quality of post-graduate education at Oxford ===
In 2007, an op-ed in &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; by two American Rhodes Scholars caused an &quot;international row over Oxford&#x27;s status as a top university&quot; when they criticised the university&#x27;s post-graduate education as &quot;outdated&quot; and &quot;frustrating&quot; in comparison to their education in the United States, specifically pointing to the perceived low quality of instruction and an insufficient scholarship stipend for living expenses. They also criticised the Rhodes application process itself, arguing that potential applicants should not apply unless they are &quot;ready to study and live in Oxford.&quot;

The original op-ed spurred responses on both sides of the Atlantic. Other students criticised the authors for their tone of &quot;ingratitude and entitlement,&quot; while &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; noted that it fueled the rivalry between the University of Cambridge, Harvard University, and the University of Oxford and existing concerns about the quality of British graduate education. In response, the Rhodes Trust released two statements, one to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; saying that &quot;the criticisms…are unrepresentative of the vast majority of Americans&quot; studying at Oxford, and another as a reply to the original op-ed arguing that &quot;false expectations&quot;, particularly for those uncertain about their degree choice, and going to Oxford for the &quot;wrong reasons&quot;, could contribute to dissatisfaction.

== Notable scholars and career trajectories ==

Surveying the history of the Rhodes Scholarship, Schaeper and Schaeper conclude that while &quot;few of them have &#x27;changed the world&#x27;…most of them have been a credit to their professions…and communities,&quot; finding that &quot;the great majority of Rhodes Scholars have had solid, respectable careers.&quot; Eight former Rhodes scholars subsequently became heads of government or heads of state, including Wasim Sajjad (Pakistan), Bill Clinton (United States), Dom Mintoff (Malta), John Turner (Canada), Norman Manley (Jamaica), and three Prime Ministers of Australia: Bob Hawke, Tony Abbott and Malcolm Turnbull.

From 1951 to 1997, 32% of American Rhodes Scholars pursued careers in education and academia, 20% in law, 15% in business, and 10% in medicine and science. Although Cecil Rhodes imagined that scholars would &quot;pursue a full-time career in government…the number of scholars in local, state and federal government has remained at a steady 7 per cent&quot; over the past century. Of the 200 or so scholars who have spent their careers in government, &quot;most of them have had solid, but undistinguished careers,&quot; while &quot;perhaps forty or more can be said to have had a significant, national impact in their particular areas.&quot;

The most popular career choice for Rhodes Scholars is education and academia, with many becoming deans of law and medical schools and others becoming professors and lecturers. Many of the most distinguished Rhodes Scholars, such as Zambian activist Lucy Banda, have become prominent members of the civil rights movement. In 1990, third-wave feminist author Naomi Wolf put forward ideas about beauty and power with her book &quot;The Beauty Myth&quot;, ushering in a new type of feminism that has risen to prominence in the digital age.

Rhodes Scholars have had a notable impact in the fields of medicine and science. Howard Florey was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship in 1922 after studying medicine at the University of Adelaide Medical School. In 1939 Florey, along with fellow scientist Ernst Boris Chain, led the team that successfully isolated and purified penicillin. Robert Q. Marston, an American Rhodes Scholar who studied with Florey, was Director of the National Institutes of Health (USA) from 1968 to 1973. He was credited with maintaining the high quality of basic science research in the Institutes.
=== Human rights, social justice and advocacy ===

==== Law ====
Challenging some of the convictions of the scholarship&#x27;s founder is not a recent occurrence. As early as 1931, Afrikaans-born anti-apartheid lawyer and Rhodes Scholar Bram Fischer campaigned for equal rights for all South Africans. This led him to join the Communist Party of South Africa. Fischer was struck off the roll by the Johannesburg Bar Council in 1965 after he skipped bail on charges under the Suppression of Communism Act. He was later arrested and sentenced to life in prison. Other Rhodes Scholars have taken on difficult social causes with more success. Fred Paterson defended workers and unions at a reduced price, before he sat in parliament as the first and only Communist party member in Australian history. In 1978, former Rhodes Scholar Ann Olivarius sued Yale University over their mis-handling of on-campus sexual harassment complaints.

==== Education and child welfare ====
After leaving Oxford to write his first novel, former Rhodes Scholar Jonathan Kozol worked as a teacher in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. He would go on to write &quot;Death at an Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools,&quot; after witnessing first-hand the devastating effect educational inequality was having on America. Rhodes Scholars Marc Kielburger and Roxanne Joyal conduct similar work with their organization Free the Children. Together they build schools and educate children in developing countries across Africa.

==== Civil and human rights ====
Much of the Rhodes alumni civil and human rights work has been focused in Africa, particularly South Africa. South African Justice Edwin Cameron initially focused his attention on law and employment law, but later worked in the field of LGBT rights as well as co-founding the Aids Consortium. Two-time Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Nick Kristof was pivotal in shedding light on atrocities such as Tiananmen Square and the Darfur genocide. Professor Sandra Fredman has also written extensively on anti-discrimination law, human rights law and labour law. Rhiana Gunn-Wright was the creator of the Green New Deal.

=== Medical innovation ===

==== Genetics ====
In 2014, Iranian Rhodes Scholar Pardis Sabeti used genome sequencing and computational genetics to identify the source of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa. She is also the front-person for indie-rock band Thousand Days.

Another Rhodes Scholar working in genome research is the mathematician and geneticist Eric Lander. His ideas in human genetics, particularly mapping and sequencing, led to the creation of The Cancer Genome Atlas.

==== Disease and epidemiology ====
Salim Yusuf, an Indian scholar, conducted significant research into heart health and its relationship to developing economies. He observed that shifts in the developing world, particularly dietary changes and increased urbanization, lead to higher incidences of heart attacks and strokes.

In Zimbabwe, A. Tariro Makadzange has researched perinatally infected children with HIV and HIV-positive adults with cryptococcal disease. Since graduating from Oxford, she has set up a new infectious disease laboratory at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare.

Sir Alimuddin Zumla, a British-Zambian, infectious diseases scholar declined an offer to take up the scholarship. Decades later, Zumla was recognized by Clarivate Analytics, Web of Science as one of the world&#x27;s top 1% most cited researchers.

==== Surgery ====
After studying at Oxford, surgeon and author Atul Gawande became an advisor to Bill Clinton and the U.S Department of Health and Human Services. In recent years he has devised an innovative checklist for a successful surgery. Other surgical innovations brought about by Rhodes Scholars include the GliaSite technique, a device that lowers the risks associated with radiation therapy in brain tumours. 

A number of Rhodes scholars have gone on to careers in neurosurgery. One of the most influential neurosurgeons of all time, Wilder Penfield, was a Canadian Rhodes Scholar in 1915. Neurosurgeon Sir Hugh Cairns was a Rhodes Scholar for South Australia in 1917, whose treatment of Lawrence of Arabia led to research that informed the introduction of motorcycle helmets. Neurosurgeon Griffith Harsh was a Rhodes Scholar and created the GliaSite device.

=== Arts ===

==== Literature ====
One of the first recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship was the American poet, educator and critic John Crowe Ransom. He became a founding member of the influential Fugitive literary group. A contemporary of Ransom&#x27;s who also became a Rhodes Scholar was Robert Penn Warren. Warren was lambasted by his peers who told him that the study of English literature was a soft option; seeking to rebut such attacks, he introduced new critical ideas into the study of poetry and fiction, and these ideas went on to change how literature was taught at undergraduate and postgraduate levels, not only in America itself. Tasmanian Rhodes Scholar Richard Flanagan (Tasmania and Worcester, 1984) is a celebrated author, having been awarded the Man Booker Prize in 2014 for his novel &quot;The Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot;.

==== Hip-hop ====
In 2006 (before receiving a Rhodes Scholarship), lawyer and current Lieutenant Governor of New York Antonio Delgado critiqued capitalism and racial injustice under the name &quot;AD the Voice.&quot;

Roughly 90 years previously, the phrase &quot;keeping it real&quot; was used by Rhodes scholar Alain Locke in his book &quot;The New Negro&quot; to describe the pursuit of in the face of mainstream media&#x27;s portrayal of African American culture. Locke&#x27;s work inspired the Harlem Renaissance movement, and &quot;keeping it real&quot; has since become a universally recognized hip-hop ethos.

=== Science and technology ===

==== Space exploration ====
After studying ion propulsion at Oxford, Dr. Jennifer Gruber embarked on a career as a space engineer. She is currently coordinating missions between the Johnson Space Center and the International Space Station as an employee of NASA.

==== Cosmology ====
Rhodes Scholar Brian Greene co-founded ISCAP, Columbia&#x27;s Institute for Strings, Cosmology, and Astroparticle Physics. As well as winning a Pulitzer Prize for non-fiction, Greene made some ground-breaking discoveries in the field of superstring theory and was one of the cosmologists to co-develop superstring theory.

== Comparison to other post-graduate scholarships ==
The Rhodes Scholarship model has inspired successor scholarships in many countries. These include:

* The Kennedy Scholarship for British nationals to study at Harvard University or the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1964)
* The international Yenching Scholarship for study at Peking University (2015)
* The international Schwarzman Scholarship for study at Tsinghua University (2016)
* The international Knight-Hennessy Scholars to study at Stanford University (2018)
* The international McCall MacBain Scholars to study at McGill University (2019)

In structure and selection criteria, the scholarship is similar to the John Monash Scholarship, Schwarzman Scholarship, Knight-Hennessy Scholarship, Weidenfeld-Hoffmann Scholarship and Leadership Program, Gates Cambridge Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Yenching Scholarship, Fulbright Program, Erasmus Mundus scholarship, and Chevening Scholarship. As with the Rhodes, the Gates Cambridge, Yenching, Knight-Hennessy, and Schwarzman scholarships are tenable at only one university. The Knight-Hennessy and Schwarzman Scholarships similarly award scholarships to students from all nations, with a focus on public service and leadership.

The Rhodes Scholarship is most closely associated with the Marshall Scholarship, with university fellowship offices often preparing applicants for both concurrently. The founders of the Marshall in 1953 initially considered partnering with the Rhodes and even considered using the same selection committees, but this idea was disregarded because the Marshall proponents believed the scholarships should be available to women, and to married men under the age of 28; at the time, the Rhodes Scholarship was limited to single men under the age of 25. Some highlight a longstanding rivalry between the two since the Marshall was established, with the Rhodes historically perceived as more &quot;athletic&quot; and the Marshall &quot;more intellectual,&quot; though the distinctions between them today are negligible. When he applied for the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships, 1959 Marshall Scholar Stephen Breyer &quot;made a frustrating and ultimately unsuccessful attempt to crew at Stanford in order to fulfill the &quot;Rhodes&quot; scholarship&#x27;s athletic requirement.&quot;

<doc id="172211" wikidata="Q384188" url="?curid=172211" title="Magnetoencephalography">
<text>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a functional neuroimaging technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, while the SERF (spin exchange relaxation-free) magnetometer is being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback. This can be applied in a clinical setting to find locations of abnormalities as well as in an experimental setting to simply measure brain activity.

== History ==
MEG signals were first measured by University of Illinois physicist David Cohen in 1968, before the availability of the SQUID, using a copper induction coil as the detector. To reduce the magnetic background noise, the measurements were made in a magnetically shielded room. The coil detector was barely sensitive enough, resulting in poor, noisy MEG measurements that were difficult to use. Later, Cohen built a much better shielded room at MIT, and used one of the first SQUID detectors, just developed by James E. Zimmerman, a researcher at Ford Motor Company, to again measure MEG signals. This time the signals were almost as clear as those of EEG. This stimulated the interest of physicists who had been looking for uses of SQUIDs. Subsequent to this, various types of spontaneous and evoked MEGs began to be measured.

At first, a single SQUID detector was used to successively measure the magnetic field at a number of points around the subject&#x27;s head. This was cumbersome, and, in the 1980s, MEG manufacturers began to arrange multiple sensors into arrays to cover a larger area of the head. Present-day MEG arrays are set in a helmet-shaped vacuum flask that typically contain 300 sensors, covering most of the head. In this way, MEGs of a subject or patient can now be accumulated rapidly and efficiently.

Recent developments attempt to increase portability of MEG scanners by using spin exchange relaxation-free (SERF) magnetometers. SERF magnetometers are relatively small, as they do not require bulky cooling systems to operate. At the same time, they feature sensitivity equivalent to that of SQUIDs. In 2012, it was demonstrated that MEG could work with a chip-scale atomic magnetometer (CSAM, type of SERF). More recently, in 2017, researchers built a working prototype that uses SERF magnetometers installed into portable individually 3D-printed helmets, which they noted in interviews could be replaced with something easier to use in future, such as a bike helmet.

== The basis of the MEG signal ==
Synchronized neuronal currents induce weak magnetic fields. The brain&#x27;s magnetic field, measuring at 10 femtotesla (fT) for cortical activity and 103 fT for the human alpha rhythm, is considerably smaller than the ambient magnetic noise in an urban environment, which is on the order of 108 fT or 0.1 μT. The essential problem of biomagnetism is, thus, the weakness of the signal relative to the sensitivity of the detectors, and to the competing environmental noise.

The MEG (and EEG) signals derive from the net effect of ionic currents flowing in the dendrites of neurons during synaptic transmission. In accordance with Maxwell&#x27;s equations, any electrical current will produce a magnetic field, and it is this field that is measured. The net currents can be thought of as current dipoles, i.e. currents with a position, orientation, and magnitude, but no spatial extent. According to the right-hand rule, a current dipole gives rise to a magnetic field that points around the axis of its vector component.

To generate a signal that is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated tangentially to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci. Researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods in the search for methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available.

It is worth noting that action potentials do not usually produce an observable field, mainly because the currents associated with action potentials flow in opposite directions and the magnetic fields cancel out. However, action fields have been measured from peripheral nerve system.

== Magnetic shielding ==
Since the magnetic signals emitted by the brain are on the order of a few femtoteslas, shielding from external magnetic signals, including the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, is necessary. Appropriate magnetic shielding can be obtained by constructing rooms made of aluminium and mu-metal for reducing high-frequency and low-frequency noise, respectively.
=== Magnetically shielded room (MSR) ===
A magnetically shielded room (MSR) model consists of three nested main layers. Each of these layers is made of a pure aluminium layer plus a high-permeability ferromagnetic layer, similar in composition to molybdenum permalloy. The ferromagnetic layer is supplied as 1 mm sheets, while the innermost layer is composed of four sheets in close contact, and the outer two layers are composed of three sheets each. Magnetic continuity is maintained by overlay strips. Insulating washers are used in the screw assemblies to ensure that each main layer is electrically isolated. This helps eliminate radio frequency radiation, which would degrade SQUID performance. Electrical continuity of the aluminium is also maintained by aluminium overlay strips to ensure AC eddy current shielding, which is important at frequencies greater than 1 Hz. The junctions of the inner layer are often electroplated with silver or gold to improve conductivity of the aluminium layers.

=== Active shielding system ===
Active systems are designed for three-dimensional noise cancellation. To implement an active system, low-noise fluxgate magnetometers are mounted at the center of each surface and oriented orthogonally to it. This negatively feeds a DC amplifier through a low-pass network with a slow falloff to minimize positive feedback and oscillation. Built into the system are shaking and degaussing wires. Shaking wires increase the magnetic permeability, while the permanent degaussing wires are applied to all surfaces of the inner main layer to degauss the surfaces. Moreover, noise cancellation algorithms can reduce both low-frequency and high-frequency noise. Modern systems have a noise floor of around 2–3 fT/Hz0.5 above 1 Hz.

=== The inverse problem ===
The challenge posed by MEG is to determine the location of electric activity within the brain from the induced magnetic fields outside the head. Problems such as this, where model parameters (the location of the activity) have to be estimated from measured data (the SQUID signals) are referred to as &quot;inverse problems&quot; (in contrast to &quot;forward problems&quot; where the model parameters (e.g. source location) are known and the data (e.g. the field at a given distance) is to be estimated.) The primary difficulty is that the inverse problem does not have a unique solution (i.e., there are infinite possible &quot;correct&quot; answers), and the problem of defining the &quot;best&quot; solution is itself the subject of intensive research. Possible solutions can be derived using models involving prior knowledge of brain activity.

The source models can be either over-determined or under-determined. An over-determined model may consist of a few point-like sources (&quot;equivalent dipoles&quot;), whose locations are then estimated from the data. Under-determined models may be used in cases where many different distributed areas are activated (&quot;distributed source solutions&quot;): there are infinitely many possible current distributions explaining the measurement results, but the most likely is selected. Localization algorithms make use of given source and head models to find a likely location for an underlying focal field generator.

One type of localization algorithm for overdetermined models operates by expectation-maximization: the system is initialized with a first guess. A loop is started, in which a forward model is used to simulate the magnetic field that would result from the current guess. The guess is adjusted to reduce the discrepancy between the simulated field and the measured field. This process is iterated until convergence.

Another common technique is beamforming, wherein a theoretical model of the magnetic field produced by a given current dipole is used as a prior, along with second-order statistics of the data in the form of a covariance matrix, to calculate a linear weighting of the sensor array (the beamformer) via the Backus-Gilbert inverse. This is also known as a linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer. When the beamformer is applied to the data, it produces an estimate of the power in a &quot;virtual channel&quot; at the source location.

The extent to which the constraint-free MEG inverse problem is ill-posed cannot be overemphasized. If one&#x27;s goal is to estimate the current density within the human brain with say a 5mm resolution then it is well established that the vast majority of the information needed to perform a unique inversion must come not from the magnetic field measurement but rather from the constraints applied to the problem. Furthermore, even when a unique inversion is possible in the presence of such constraints said inversion can be unstable. These conclusions are easily deduced from published works.

=== Magnetic source imaging ===
The source locations can be combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to create magnetic source images (MSI). The two sets of data are combined by measuring the location of a common set of fiducial points marked during MRI with lipid markers and marked during MEG with electrified coils of wire that give off magnetic fields. The locations of the fiducial points in each data set are then used to define a common coordinate system so that superimposing the functional MEG data onto the structural MRI data (&quot;coregistration&quot;) is possible.

A criticism of the use of this technique in clinical practice is that it produces colored areas with definite boundaries superimposed upon an MRI scan: the untrained viewer may not realize that the colors do not represent a physiological certainty, not because of the relatively low spatial resolution of MEG, but rather some inherent uncertainty in the probability cloud derived from statistical processes. However, when the magnetic source image corroborates other data, it can be of clinical utility.

=== Dipole model source localization ===
A widely accepted source-modeling technique for MEG involves calculating a set of equivalent current dipoles (ECDs), which assumes the underlying neuronal sources to be focal. This dipole fitting procedure is non-linear and over-determined, since the number of unknown dipole parameters is smaller than the number of MEG measurements. Automated multiple dipole model algorithms such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) and multi-start spatial and temporal modeling (MSST) are applied to the analysis of MEG responses. The limitations of dipole models for characterizing neuronal responses are (1) difficulties in localizing extended sources with ECDs, (2) problems with accurately estimating the total number of dipoles in advance, and (3) dependency on dipole location, especially depth in the brain.

=== Distributed source models ===
Unlike multiple-dipole modeling, distributed source models divide the source space into a grid containing a large number of dipoles. The inverse problem is to obtain the dipole moments for the grid nodes. As the number of unknown dipole moments is much greater than the number of MEG sensors, the inverse solution is highly underdetermined, so additional constraints are needed to reduce ambiguity of the solution. The primary advantage of this approach is that no prior specification of the source model is necessary. However, the resulting distributions may be difficult to interpret, because they only reflect a &quot;blurred&quot; (or even distorted) image of the true neuronal source distribution. The matter is complicated by the fact that spatial resolution depends strongly on various parameters such as brain area, depth, orientation, number of sensors etc.

=== Independent component analysis (ICA) ===
Independent component analysis (ICA) is another signal processing solution that separates different signals that are statistically independent in time. It is primarily used to remove artifacts such as blinking, eye muscle movement, facial muscle artifacts, cardiac artifacts, etc. from MEG and EEG signals that may be contaminated with outside noise. However, ICA has poor resolution of highly correlated brain sources.

== Use in the field ==

In research, MEG&#x27;s primary use is the measurement of time courses of activity. MEG can resolve events with a precision of 10 milliseconds or faster, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which depends on changes in blood flow, can at best resolve events with a precision of several hundred milliseconds. MEG also accurately pinpoints sources in primary auditory, somatosensory, and motor areas. For creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks, MEG is most often combined with fMRI, as the methods complement each other. Neuronal (MEG) and hemodynamic fMRI data do not necessarily agree, in spite of the tight relationship between local field potentials (LFP) and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals. MEG and BOLD signals may originate from the same source (though the BOLD signals are filtered through the hemodynamic response).

MEG is also being used to better localize responses in the brain. The openness of the MEG setup allows external auditory and visual stimuli to be easily introduced. Some movement by the subject is also possible as long as it does not jar the subject&#x27;s head. The responses in the brain before, during, and after the introduction of such stimuli/movement can then be mapped with greater spatial resolution than was previously possible with EEG. Psychologists are also taking advantage of MEG neuroimaging to better understand relationships between brain function and behavior. For example, a number of studies have been done comparing the MEG responses of patients with psychological troubles to control patients. There has been great success isolating unique responses in patients with schizophrenia, such as auditory gating deficits to human voices. MEG is also being used to correlate standard psychological responses, such as the emotional dependence of language comprehension.

Recent studies have reported successful classification of patients with multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, schizophrenia, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, chronic alcoholism, facial pain and thalamocortical dysrhythmias. MEG can be used to distinguish these patients from healthy control subjects, suggesting a future role of MEG in diagnostics.

A large part of the difficulty and cost of using MEG is the need for manual analysis of the data. Progress has been made in analysis by computer, comparing a patient&#x27;s scans with those drawn from a large database of normal scans, with the potential to reduce cost greatly.

=== Brain connectivity and neural oscillations ===
Based on its perfect temporal resolution, magnetoencephalography (MEG) is now heavily used to study oscillatory activity in the brain, both in terms of local neural synchrony and cross-area synchronisation. As an example for local neural synchrony, MEG has been used to investigate alpha rhythms in various targeted brain regions, such as in visual or auditory cortex. Other studies have used MEG to study the neural interactions between different brain regions (e.g., between frontal cortex and visual cortex). Magnetoencephalography can also be used to study changes in neural oscillations across different stages of consciousness, such as in sleep.

=== Focal epilepsy ===
The clinical uses of MEG are in detecting and localizing pathological activity in patients with epilepsy, and in localizing eloquent cortex for surgical planning in patients with brain tumors or intractable epilepsy. The goal of epilepsy surgery is to remove the epileptogenic tissue while sparing healthy brain areas. Knowing the exact position of essential brain regions (such as the primary motor cortex and primary sensory cortex, visual cortex, and areas involved in speech production and comprehension) helps to avoid surgically induced neurological deficits. Direct cortical stimulation and somatosensory evoked potentials recorded on electrocorticography (ECoG) are considered the gold standard for localizing essential brain regions. These procedures can be performed either intraoperatively or from chronically indwelling subdural grid electrodes. Both are invasive.

Noninvasive MEG localizations of the central sulcus obtained from somatosensory evoked magnetic fields show strong agreement with these invasive recordings. MEG studies assist in clarification of the functional organization of primary somatosensory cortex and to delineate the spatial extent of hand somatosensory cortex by stimulation of the individual digits. This agreement between invasive localization of cortical tissue and MEG recordings shows the effectiveness of MEG analysis and indicates that MEG may substitute invasive procedures in the future.

=== Fetal ===
MEG has been used to study cognitive processes such as vision, audition, and language processing in fetuses and newborns. Only two bespoke MEG systems, designed specifically for fetal recordings, operate worldwide. The first was installed at the University of Arkansas in 2000, and the second was installed at the University of Tübingen in 2008. Both devices are referred to as SQUID arrays for reproductive assessment (SARA) and utilize a concave sensor array whose shape compliments the abdomen of a pregnant woman. Fetal recordings of cortical activity are feasible with a SARA device from a gestational age of approximately 25 weeks onward until birth. Although built for fetal recordings, SARA systems can also record from infants placed in a cradle head-first toward the sensory array. A third high density custom-made unit with similar whole abdomen coverage has been installed in 2002 at the University of Kansas Medical Center to assess fetal electrophysiology. While only a small number of devices worldwide are capable of fetal MEG recordings as of 2023, the proliferation of optically pumped magnetometers for MEG in neuroscience research will likely result in a greater number of research centers capable of recording and publishing fetal MEG data in the near future.

===Traumatic brain injury===
MEG can be used to identify traumatic brain injury, which is particularly common among soldiers exposed to explosions. Such injuries are not easily diagnosed by other methods, as the symptoms (e.g. sleep disturbances, memory problems) overlap with those from frequent co-comorbidities such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).

==Comparison with related techniques==
MEG has been in development since the 1960s but has been greatly aided by recent advances in computing algorithms and hardware, and promises improved spatial resolution coupled with extremely high temporal resolution (better than 1 ms). Since the MEG signal is a direct measure of neuronal activity, its temporal resolution is comparable with that of intracranial electrodes.

MEG complements other brain activity measurement techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), and fMRI. Its strengths consist in independence of head geometry compared to EEG (unless ferromagnetic implants are present), non-invasiveness, use of no ionizing radiation, as opposed to PET and high temporal resolution as opposed to fMRI.

=== MEG in comparison to EEG ===
Although EEG and MEG signals originate from the same neurophysiological processes, there are important differences. Magnetic fields are less distorted than electric fields by the skull and scalp, which results in a better spatial resolution of the MEG. Whereas scalp EEG is sensitive to both tangential and radial components of a current source in a spherical volume conductor, MEG detects only its tangential components. Scalp EEG can, therefore, detect activity both in the sulci and at the top of the cortical gyri, whereas MEG is most sensitive to activity originating in sulci. EEG is, therefore, sensitive to activity in more brain areas, but activity that is visible in MEG can also be localized with more accuracy.

Scalp EEG is sensitive to extracellular volume currents produced by postsynaptic potentials. MEG detects intracellular currents associated primarily with these synaptic potentials because the field components generated by volume currents tend to cancel out in a spherical volume conductor. The decay of magnetic fields as a function of distance is more pronounced than for electric fields. Therefore, MEG is more sensitive to superficial cortical activity, which makes it useful for the study of neocortical epilepsy. Finally, MEG is reference-free, while scalp EEG relies on a reference that, when active, makes interpretation of the data difficult.

<text>[[Russia]] is divided into several types and levels of subdivisions.

== Federal districts ==


The federal districts are groupings of the federal subjects of Russia. Federal districts are not mentioned in the nation&#x27;s constitution, do not have competences of their own, and do not manage regional affairs. They exist solely to monitor consistency between the federal and regional bodies of law, and ensure governmental control over the civil service, judiciary, and federal agencies operating in the regions. The federal district system was established on 13 May 2000. There are total eight federal districts.
==Federal subjects==


Since 30 September 2022, the Russian Federation has consisted of eighty-nine federal subjects that are constituent members of the Federation. However, six of these federal subjects—the Republic of Crimea, the Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic, the Kherson Oblast, the Lugansk People&#x27;s Republic, the federal city of Sevastopol, and the Zaporozhye Oblast—are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. All federal subjects are of equal federal rights in the sense that they have equal representation—two delegates each—in the Federation Council (upper house of the Federal Assembly). They do, however, differ in the degree of autonomy they enjoy.

De jure, excluding the occupied Ukrainian territories, there are 6 types of federal subjects—21 republics, 9 krais, 46 oblasts, 2 federal cities, 1 autonomous oblast, and 4 autonomous okrugs.

Autonomous okrugs are the only ones that have an unusual status of being federal subjects in their own right, yet at the same time they are considered to be administrative divisions of other federal subjects (with the Chukotka Autonomous Okrug being the only exception).

===Status of the Ukrainian territories occupied by Russia===
On 18 March 2014, as a part of the annexation of Crimea and following the establishment of the Republic of Crimea (an independent entity that was recognized only by Russia), a treaty was signed between Russia and the Republic of Crimea incorporating the Republic of Crimea and the City of Sevastopol as constituent members of the Russian Federation. According to the Treaty, the Republic of Crimea is accepted as a federal subject with the status of a republic while the City of Sevastopol has received federal city status. Neither the Republic of Crimea nor the city of Sevastopol are politically recognized as parts of Russia by most countries.

Similarly, Russia also annexed four Ukrainian oblasts of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, and Zaporozhzhia on 30 September 2022 after internationally-unrecognized referendums held days prior, during the invasion of Ukraine that began in late February, which were organized by Russian occupation authorities in territories where hostilities were ongoing and much of the population had fled. It occurred seven months after the start of the invasion and less than a month after the start of the Ukrainian Kharkiv counteroffensive. The signing ceremony was held in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow in the presence of occupation authority heads Leonid Pasechnik, Denis Pushilin, Yevgeny Balitsky, and Vladimir Saldo, and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Like Crimea, none of the four occupied regions are internationally recognized as part of Russia.

==List==

===Notes===

a. The largest city is also listed when it is different from the capital/administrative centre.

b. According to Article 13 of the Charter of Leningrad Oblast, the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Saint Petersburg. However, Saint Petersburg is not officially the administrative centre of the oblast.

c. According to Article 24 of the Charter of Moscow Oblast, the governing bodies of the oblast are located in the city of Moscow and throughout the territory of Moscow Oblast. However, Moscow is not officially the administrative centre of the oblast.

d. Internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.

e. In February 2000, the former code of 20 for the Chechen Republic was cancelled and replaced with code 95. License plate production was suspended due to the Chechen Wars, causing numerous issues, which in turn forced the region to use a new code.

f. Claimed, but only partially controlled by Russia.

g. As Russia only partially controls the region, this is a claimed figure.
==Administrative divisions==
Prior to the adoption of the 1993 Constitution of Russia, the administrative-territorial structure of Russia was regulated by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 17 August 1982 &quot;On the Procedures of Dealing with the Matters of the Administrative-Territorial Structure of the RSFSR&quot;. The 1993 Constitution, however, did not identify the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions as the responsibility of the federal government nor as the joint responsibility of the federal government and the subjects. This was interpreted by the governments of the federal subjects as a sign that the matters of the administrative-territorial divisions became solely the responsibility of the federal subjects. As a result, the modern administrative-territorial structures of the federal subjects vary significantly from one federal subject to another. While the implementation details may be considerably different, in general, however, the following types of high-level administrative divisions are recognized:
*administrative districts (raions)
*cities/towns and urban-type settlements of federal subject significance
*closed administrative-territorial formations

Autonomous okrugs and okrugs are intermediary units of administrative divisions, which include some of the federal subject&#x27;s districts and cities/towns/urban-type settlements of federal subject significance.
*Autonomous okrugs, while being under the jurisdiction of another federal subject, are still constitutionally recognized as federal subjects on their own right. Chukotka Autonomous Okrug is an exception in that it is not administratively subordinated to any other federal subject of Russia.
*Okrugs are usually former autonomous okrugs that lost their federal subject status due to a merger with another federal subject.

Typical lower-level administrative divisions include:
*selsoviets (rural councils)
*towns and urban-type settlements of the administrative district significance

==Municipal divisions==
In the course of the Russian municipal reform of 2004–2005, all federal subjects of Russia were to streamline the structures of local self-government, which is guaranteed by the Constitution of Russia. The reform mandated that each federal subject was to have a unified structure of municipal government bodies by 1 January 2005, and a law enforcing the reform provisions went into effect on 1 January 2006. According to the law, the units of the municipal division (called &quot;municipal formations&quot;) are as follows:
*Municipal district, a group of urban and rural settlements, often along with the inter-settlement territories. In practice, municipal districts are usually formed within the boundaries of existing administrative districts (&quot;raions&quot;).
**Urban settlement (Russia), a city/town or an urban-type settlement, possibly together with adjacent rural and/or urban localities
**Rural settlement (Russia), one or several rural localities
*Urban okrug, an urban settlement not incorporated into a municipal district. In practice, urban okrugs are usually formed within the boundaries of existing cities of federal subject significance.
*Intra-urban territory (intra-urban municipal formation) of a federal city, a part of a federal city&#x27;s territory. In Moscow, these are called municipal formations (which correspond to districts); in St. Petersburg—&quot;municipal okrugs&quot;, &quot;towns&quot;, and &quot;settlements&quot;. In Sevastopol (located on the Crimean Peninsula, which is a territory disputed between Russia and Ukraine), they are known as &quot;municipal okrugs&quot; and a &quot;town&quot;.

Territories not included as a part of municipal formations are known as , a concept introduced in 2019.

The Federal Law was amended on 27 May 2014 to include new types of municipal divisions:
*Urban okrug with intra-urban divisions, an urban okrug divided into intra-urban districts at the lower level of the municipal hierarchy
**Intra-urban district, a municipal formation within an urban okrug with intra-urban divisions. This municipal formation type would typically be established within the borders of existing city districts (i.e., the administrative divisions in some of the cities of federal subject significance).

In June 2014, Chelyabinsky Urban Okrug became the first urban okrug to implement intra-urban divisions.

Federal legislation introduced on May 1, 2019, added an additional territorial unit:
*Municipal okrug, a grouping of several settlements without municipal status. Municipal okrugs formally exercise local self-government either through direct means or through electoral and other institutions.

==Economic regions==
For economic and statistical purposes the federal subjects are grouped into twelve economic regions. Economic regions and their parts sharing common economic trends are in turn grouped into economic zones and macrozones.
==Military districts==
In order for the Armed Forces to provide an efficient management of military units, their training, and other operational activities, the federal subjects are grouped into five military districts. Each military district operates under the command of the district headquarters, headed by the district commander, and is subordinated to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation.

<doc id="172213" wikidata="Q1515757" url="?curid=172213" title="Jump blues">
<text>Jump blues is an up-tempo style of blues, jazz, and boogie woogie usually played by small groups and featuring horn instruments. It was popular in the 1940s and was a precursor of rhythm and blues and rock and roll. Appreciation of jump blues was renewed in the 1990s as part of the swing revival.

==Origins==
Jump blues evolved from the music of big bands such as those of Lionel Hampton and Lucky Millinder in the early 1940s. The typical jump blues lineup consisted of 5-7 members including sax, bass, drums and piano and/or guitar. The genre produced musicians such as Louis Jordan, Jack McVea, Earl Bostic, and Arnett Cobb. Jordan was the most popular of the jump blues stars; other artists who played the genre include Roy Brown, Amos Milburn, and Joe Liggins, as well as sax soloists Jack McVea, Big Jay McNeely, and Bull Moose Jackson. Hits included singles such as Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot;, Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; and Big Jay McNeely&#x27;s &quot;Deacon&#x27;s Hop&quot;.

One important stylistic prototype in the development of R&amp;B was jump blues, pioneered by Louis Jordan, with ... His Tympany Five ... three horns and a rhythm section, while stylistically his music melded elements of swing and blues, incorporating the shuffle rhythm, boogie-woogie bass lines, and short horn patterns or riffs. The songs featured the use of African American vernacular language, humor, and vocal call-and-response sections between Jordan and the band. Jordan’s music appealed to both African American and white audiences, and he had broad success with hit songs like &quot;Is You Is or Is You Ain’t My Baby&quot; (1944).

Blues and jazz were part of the same musical world, with many musicians straddling both genres. Jump bands such as the Tympany Five, which came into being at the same time as the boogie-woogie revival, achieved maximum effect with an eight-to-the-bar boogie-woogie style.

Jordan&#x27;s &quot;raucous recordings&quot; with the Tympany Five like &quot;Saturday Night Fish Fry&quot;, one of the first to feature a distorted electric guitar, &quot;literally made its listeners jump to its pulsing beat&quot;. At least two other Jordan records are viewed as jump blues, &quot;Caldonia&quot; and &quot;Choo Choo Ch&#x27;Boogie&quot;. Jordan&#x27;s jump blues combined good-natured novelty lyrics (some with suggestive double meanings); pushing the tempo; strengthening the beat; layering the sound with his bluesy saxophone and playful melodies. 

Lionel Hampton recorded the stomping big-band blues song &quot;Flying Home&quot; in 1942. Featuring a choked, screaming tenor sax performance by Illinois Jacquet, the song was a hit in the &quot;race&quot; category. &quot;Billboard&quot; described &quot;Flying Home&quot; as &quot;an unusually swingy side...with a bright bounce in the medium tempo and a steady drive maintained, it&#x27;s a jumper that defies standing still&quot;. 

Both Hampton and Jordan combined the popular boogie-woogie rhythm, a grittier version of swing-era saxophone styles as exemplified by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster, and playful, humorous lyrics or verbal asides laced with jive talk.

As this urban, jazz-based music became more popular, musicians who wanted to &quot;play for the people&quot; began favoring a heavy, insistent beat. which appealed to black listeners who no longer wished to be identified with &quot;life down home&quot;.

Jump groups, employed to play for jitterbug dances at a much lower cost than big bands, became popular with agents and ballroom owners. The saxophonist Art Chaney said &quot;[w]e were insulted when an audience wouldn&#x27;t dance&quot;.

Jump was especially popular in the late 1940s and early 1950s, through artists such as Louis Jordan, Big Joe Turner, Roy Brown, Charles Brown, Helen Humes, T-Bone Walker, Roy Milton, Billy Wright, Wynonie Harris, Louis Prima, and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Less frequently mentioned, Goree Carter also recorded some jump blues; his &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; is said by Robert Palmer to be an appropriate candidate for the title of first rock and roll record. 

By the mid-1950s, some jump blues songs had become core standards, with songs like &quot;Train Kept a Rollin&quot; played by rock groups including the Yardbirds, Aerosmith and Motorhead. &quot;Five Guys Named Moe&quot; was covered in the 1980s by the Honeydrippers. 

The term &quot;rock and roll&quot; had a strong sexual connotation in jump blues and R&amp;B, but by the time DJ Alan Freed referred to rock and roll in the mid 1950s, &quot;the sexual component had been dialled down enough that it simply became an acceptable term for dancing&quot;.

<text>Country blues (also folk blues, rural blues, backwoods blues, or downhome blues) is one of the earliest forms of blues music. The mainly solo vocal with acoustic fingerstyle guitar accompaniment developed in the rural Southern United States in the early 20th century. It stands in contrast primarily to the urban blues style, especially in the pre-war era.

==History==
Artists such as Blind Lemon Jefferson (Texas), Charley Patton (Mississippi), Blind Willie McTell (Georgia) were among the first to record blues songs in the 1920s. Country blues ran parallel to urban blues, which was popular in cities.

Historian Elijah Wald notes many similarities between blues, bluegrass, and country &amp; western styles with roots in the American south. Record labels in the 1920s and 1930s carefully segregated musicians and defined styles for racially targeted audiences. Over time, the rural black and rural white music evolved into different styles, with artists such as Bobby Bland, Ray Charles, and Willie Nelson lamenting the divide.

Folklorist Alan Lomax was one of the first to use the term and applied it to a field recording he made of Muddy Waters at the Stovall Plantation, Mississippi, in 1941. In 1959, music historian Samuel Charters wrote &quot;The Country Blues&quot;, an influential scholarly work on the subject. He also produced an album, also titled &quot;The Country Blues&quot;, with early recordings by Jefferson, McTell, Sleepy John Estes, Bukka White, and Robert Johnson.

Charters&#x27;s works helped to introduce the then-nearly forgotten music to the American folk music revival of the late 1950s and 1960s. The acoustic roots-focused movement also gave rise to the terms &quot;folk blues&quot; and &quot;acoustic blues&quot;, especially being applied to performances and recordings made around this period. &quot;Country blues&quot; has also been used to describe regional acoustic styles, such as Delta blues, Piedmont blues, or the earliest Chicago, Texas, and Memphis blues.

<text>Louisiana blues is a genre of blues music that developed in the period after World War II in the state of Louisiana. It is generally divided into two major subgenres, with the jazz-influenced New Orleans blues based on the musical traditions of that city and the slower tempo swamp blues incorporating influences from zydeco and Cajun music from around Baton Rouge.

Major artists in the New Orleans tradition include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim and for swamp blues Slim Harpo and Lightnin&#x27; Slim. Both genres peaked in popularity in the 1960s; interest declined in the later 1960s, but there have been occasional revivals since the 1970s.

==New Orleans blues==

The blues that developed in the 1940s and 1950s in and around the city of New Orleans was strongly influenced by jazz and incorporated Caribbean influences, it is dominated by piano and saxophone but has also produced major guitar bluesmen. Major figures in the genre include Professor Longhair and Guitar Slim, who both produced major regional, national R&amp;B chart and even mainstream hits.

==Swamp blues==

Swamp blues developed around Baton Rouge in the 1950s and which reached a peak of popularity in the 1960s. It generally has a slow tempo and incorporates influences from other genres of music, particularly the regional styles of zydeco and Cajun music. Its most successful proponents included Slim Harpo and Lightnin&#x27; Slim, who enjoyed a number of rhythm and blues and national hits and whose work was frequently covered by bands of the British Invasion.

<text>Swamp blues is a type of Louisiana blues that developed in the Black communities of Southwest Louisiana in the 1950s. It incorporates influences from other genres, particularly zydeco and Cajun. Its most successful proponents include Slim Harpo and Lightnin&#x27; Slim, who enjoyed national rhythm and blues hits.

==Characteristics==

Swamp blues has a laid-back, slow tempo, and generally is a more rhythmic variation of Louisiana blues, incorporating influences from New Orleans blues, zydeco, soul music and Cajun music. It is characterized by simple but effective guitar work and is influenced by the boogie patterns used on Jimmy Reed records and the work of Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins and Muddy Waters. The sound of swamp blues was characterized by &quot;eerie echo, shuffle beats, tremolo guitars, searing harmonica and sparse percussion&quot;.

==History==
Swamp blues originated in the Black communities of Southwest Louisiana in the 1950s and was particularly associated with record producer J. D. &quot;Jay&quot; Miller. In the 1950s, Miller recorded many blues artists around the city, distributing their recordings through Excello Records in Nashville, Tennessee. The most successful and influential artist with whom he worked was guitarist and harmonica player Slim Harpo. Other major artists included Lightnin&#x27; Slim, Lazy Lester, Silas Hogan, Lonesome Sundown, and piano player Katie Webster. A number of their songs, particularly those of Slim Harpo, were covered by British Invasion bands, including the Rolling Stones, The Kinks and the Yardbirds. The popularity of the genre faded in the 1970s, with many swamp bluesmen turning to zydeco which remained popular with black audiences.

<text>Guts or disc guts (sometimes guts Frisbee in reference to the trademarked brand name) is a disc game inspired by dodgeball, involving teams throwing a flying disc (rather than balls) at members of the opposing team.

== Game play ==
One to five team members stand in a line facing the opposing team across the court, with the two teams lined up parallel to each other. Which team begins play is determined by &quot;flipping the disc&quot;, an action similar to a coin toss, but using the disc itself. One member of the team is then selected to start play. That member then raises an arm to indicate readiness to throw, at which point the members of the opposing team freeze in position. The thrower then throws the disc as hard as possible at someone on the opposing team. If the thrower misses the &quot;scoring area&quot; (a demarcated area a bit larger than the space occupied by the opposing team), the receiving team scores a point. If a member of the receiving team catches the disc cleanly, neither team scores a point. If the throw is within the scoring area and the receiving team fails to catch, or catches but drops the disc, the throwing team gets a point. The receiving team then picks up the disc and becomes the throwing team.

The receiving team must catch the disc cleanly in one hand, and may not move from position until after the disc leaves the hand of the thrower. The disc may not be trapped between the hand and any other part of the body, including the other hand. This frequently results in a challenging sequence of &quot;tips&quot; or &quot;bobbles&quot;, which are rebounds of the disc off receivers&#x27; hands or body to slow the disc down and keep it in play until it can be caught. This often involves multiple players on the receiving team.

Play continues until at least 21 points have been scored by one of the teams and there is a difference in score of at least 2 points.

The first International Frisbee Tournament was held in Eagle Harbor, Michigan, in 1958. The sport grew from a pastime of the Healy family — specifically, brothers James (Tim), John (Jake), Robert (Boots), &amp; Peter (Beka) — and, in the 1960s, its national profile was increased by Jim Boggio Sr.

As guts evolved during the 1960s, players started throwing faster and faster, until it wasn&#x27;t unusual to see presumably unbreakable discs traveling at shatter on impact with an unlucky defender&#x27;s hand. Catching a speeding disc directly was said to really &quot;take guts&quot;, thus the name of the game. One tournament player even required fifteen stitches to close a gaping wound across the palm of his hand.

By the early 1970s, the game had spread across the United States and to other countries, with coverage on radio, television, major newspapers, and magazines such as &quot;Time&quot;.

With over 60 teams at a tournament in the heyday of the game, matches became intensely competitive affairs, seeking the IFT&#x27;s Julius T. Nachazel Trophy. With radical curving shots, deflected Frisbees bobbled frantically among teammates, and spectacular diving catches, guts had become an extreme sport demanding fast reflexes, physical endurance, and concentration.

Since its rise in the 1970s, when even ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; was televising guts action, and numerous tournaments were springing up, from Toronto to Chicago and Los Angeles, the sport has gradually declined in popularity in America. Guts had been introduced in Asia by the toy company Wham-O in the 1970s, and by the 1990s it had become even more popular in Japan and Taiwan than in the US. Recent years, however, have seen pockets of strong new American players renewing competitive American interest in the game, also drawing some older players out of &quot;retirement&quot;.

==Organization==

The sport&#x27;s international governing body, as with other major flying disc games, is the World Flying Disc Federation (WFDF). For North America, the more game-specific United States Guts Players Association (USGPA) officiates.

The fiftieth annual International Frisbee Tournament (IFT), held in Hancock, Michigan, June 30 – July 1, 2007, was a large guts disc tournament, drawing players from all over the United States and Canada, and for the first time, two strong teams from Japan – including Katon, the WFDF World Champions.

As of 2007, the USGPA plans to induct some of the most outstanding players into the Guts Hall of Fame, joining Fred Morrison (inventor of the original Pluto Platter flying disc), the Healy brothers (inventors of guts and founders of the IFT), and &quot;Steady Ed&quot; Headrick (IFT champion and inventor of the standard &quot;pole hole&quot; basket used on modern disc golf courses).

==Variations==
===Dodge disc===

Dodge disc (or dodge Frisbee). In this variant, scoring is achieved not by throwing into a scoring zone, but by hitting opponents, without their successfully catching the disc. Opponents are permitted to move. As in dodgeball, if a player is hit by a disc and fails to catch it, then the player is &quot;out&quot; and exits the field of play. If a player catches the thrown disc without its touching the ground, either before or after being hit by it, or before or after it hits another player, then the player who threw the disc is out instead. The game ends when there is only one player left. The game usually ends with a &quot;shootout&quot; between two players, each with several discs. The final players tend to execute several simultaneous &quot;attacks&quot; until one is hit without catching a disc thrown by the opponent. A variant of the game, Dodgebee, is a trademark of Hero Discs. The Dodgebee disc is very soft, and thus can be thrown very fast without injuring any of the players.

===Flutterguts===

Flutterguts is a noncompetitive variant of guts. The two teams face each other a few meters apart. The main rule change is that the disc must be thrown such that it does not rotate about its central axis (i.e. it can flip, but it cannot spin). This restriction makes fast throws impossible, but catching is still challenging.
===NutDisc===
NutDisc is a variation of guts developed as a drinking game to be played around a pool. Two players face off against one another, one standing completely still, holding a drink in their outstretched hand, perpendicular to the body. The other player will throw the disc at them, attempting to hit either the player or their drink while they are not allowed to move. If the player is hit, they take a drink. If the player is hit in the genitals, they must finish their drink. If the beer is hit, the player finishes their drink and jumps into the pool.

==History==
Herborn had its first documentary mention in 1048, and was granted the privilege of a city in 1251 by the Counts of Nassau.

In 1584 the Herborn Academy, a Reformed (Calvinistic) institution, was founded by John VI of Nassau-Dillenburg, younger brother of William the Silent and namesake of today&#x27;s Gymnasium &quot;Johanneum&quot;.

Herborn was where Johannes Piscator published the Reformed Church translation of the Bible into German, in 1602. This work has had a decisive effect in shaping church life among followers of the Reformed movement in Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United States. It was printed in Herborn in the &quot;akademische Druckerei von Corvinus&quot;, known today as the &quot;Corvinsche Druckerei&quot; or &quot;Paul&#x27;s Hof&quot;, after the Paul family who own it.

In 1626, the town lost 214 houses in a fire started by accident in soldiers&#x27; quarters. Soon after, Herborn and the surrounding area were the scene of a number of witch trials.

Towards the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the townsfolk were looking after 50 Swedish soldiers, which brought them protection by the Swedish Army, and thereby also a reputation as a &quot;field hospital town&quot; (&quot;Lazarettstadt&quot;) that lasted until the end of the Second World War.

After the Congress of Vienna Herborn was in a border area next to Prussia, and its economy suffered due to import tariffs. Hesse-Nassau joined the &quot;Zollverein&quot; (Customs Union) only in 1836, and in 1866 it was completely annexed by Prussia.

In the Second World War, Herborn was mostly spared by the bombers, but its Jewish community was obliterated in 1942, and many of the patients of the psychiatric clinic were deported and murdered.

During much of the Cold War there was a small American military garrison in the community, district Seelbach.

The town became nationally known for a truck disaster that happened on 7 July 1987. After losing control because of faulty brakes, a tanker truck carrying about 34 000 L of fuel ran into a house containing an ice cream parlour and a pizzeria. The escaping fuel flowed into the sewers and exploded, setting several houses on fire. All together, six people lost their lives, and 40 were injured.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

Herborn is served today by two railway stations and four more have been abandoned.
Herborn station was opened in 1862 on the Dill Railway. The current station building dates from 1908 and was designed by the church architect Ludwig Hoffmann. In the past the station was served by two other lines:
*services on the Aar-Salzböde railway from Niederwalgern started and ended here from 1902 to 2001,
*services on the Westerwaldquer Railway to Montabaur started and ended here from 1906 to 1980.
The station is served by Regional-Express trains on the Siegen–Gießen–Frankfurt route (Main-Sieg-Express, RE 40) and Stadt-Express services on the Dillenburg-Frankfurt route (Mittelhessen-Express, SE 40, running as stopping trains between Dillenburg and Gießen).
&quot;Burg (Dillkr)&quot; station was located on the Aar-Salzböde railway (Niederwalgern–Herborn) and had three platform tracks.
&quot;Burg (Dillkr) Nord station&quot; is the other station still in operation and is also located on the Dill Railway and is classified by Deutsche Bahn (DB) as a category 6 station. It is only served by the &quot;Mittelhessen-Express&quot;.
The three stations of &quot;Burg (Dillkr) West&quot;, &quot;Uckersdorf&quot; and &quot;Amdorf&quot; were located on the Westerwaldquer Railway (Herborn–Montabaur) and are now closed.

<doc id="172225" wikidata="Q3658336" url="?curid=172225" title="New Orleans rhythm and blues">
<text>New Orleans rhythm and blues is a style of rhythm and blues that originated in New Orleans. It was a direct precursor to rock and roll and strongly influenced ska. Instrumentation typically includes drums, bass, piano, horns, electric guitar, and vocals. The style is characterized by syncopated &quot;second line&quot; rhythms, a strong backbeat, and soulful vocals. Artists such as Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, and Fats Domino are representative of the New Orleans R&amp;B sound.

== Characteristics ==
New Orleans rhythm and blues can be characterized by predominant piano, &quot;singing&quot; horns, and call-and-response elements. Clear influences of Kansas City Swing bands can be heard through the extensive use of trumpet and saxophone solos. A &quot;double&quot; bass line, when the guitar and bass play in unison, was combined with a strong backbeat to make the music easy to dance to. It is also common to hear the influence of Caribbean rhythms such as the mambo, rhumba, and the calypso.

In addition, the usage of blue notes is characteristic. Like most blues, New Orleans R&amp;B typically follows a standard three-stanza form that contains tonic, subdominant, and dominant chords. Within these chords, the three &quot;blue notes&quot;, also known as flatted notes, are the third, fifth, and seventh scale degrees. In New Orleans R&amp;B, the flatted third is particularly notable.

== Early pioneers ==
New Orleans rhythm and blues was pioneered by local barrelhouse pianists Champion Jack Dupree, Archibald, and Professor Longhair.

Professor Longhair, otherwise known as &quot;Fess&quot;, was considerably influential in the development of the New Orleans R&amp;B sound. Allen Toussaint, an important figure in New Orleans R&amp;B, described him as &quot;The Bach of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. He combined Caribbean and boogie-woogie rhythms to create his signature style. The result was a usage of polyrhythms that he often whistled while playing. Although he was admired by other New Orleans musicians, he did not gain national attention until the end of his career.

During his early career, Longhair visited the Caldonia Inn to listen to Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s band. When he sat in for Bartholomew&#x27;s pianist, a large crowd suddenly flooded the venue. He then decided to start his own band called the Four Hairs combo. Soon after, the band recorded their first four tunes at the Hi-Hat club for the Star Talent Label. In 1950, Longhair worked briefly with Mercury Records and recorded &quot;Baldheaded&quot;. The song reached No.5 on &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; R&amp;B chart. Due to financial complications, his work with Mercury was cut short. During the 1950s, he worked with Atlantic Records and recorded &quot;Tipitina&quot;, which at the time was only a local hit, but today is recognized as a New Orleans R&amp;B classic.

=== Professors and barrelhouse pianists ===
There were two types of local pianists in New Orleans; &quot;professor&quot; pianists and &quot;barrelhouse&quot; pianists. Professors were often classically trained and understood music theory. They played in a variety of styles in the brothels of Storyville. Because they were more skilled, audiences expected them play any request that was thrown their way. Notable &quot;professor&quot; pianists include Buddy Christian, Clarence Williams, Alton Purnell, Spencer Williams, and Jelly Roll Morton. Barrelhouse pianists were often untrained with little to no background in music theory. They were mostly self-taught and played mostly in a blues style. Barrelhouse pianists were considered semi-professional and played for drinks, food, or tips.

== Popular artists ==
Roy Brown, Dave Bartholomew, Paul Gayten, Smiley Lewis, Fats Domino, Annie Laurie, and Larry Darnell were the primary artists who achieved national fame.

=== Roy Brown ===

Roy Brown is considered to be one of the pioneers of the New Orleans Urban Blues as one of the first singers to blend elements of gospel into the blues. His &quot;crying&quot; sound became his signature. In March 1947, Cecil Gant heard Brown sing &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; during a set break at a club called the Rainbow Room. Cecil enjoyed the song so much that he had Brown sing it over the phone for De Luxe Records. Brown signed a contract with DeLuxe, and recorded the song at J&amp;M Studio. &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight&quot; was an immediate success in New Orleans, and reached the national charts about one year later. It became his biggest hit, and was successful enough for Brown and his band &quot;The Mighty Men&quot; to tour across California and the southwestern United States. &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight,&quot; made a reappearance in the charts in 1949 after DeLuxe was sold to King Records, who did their best to promote it, something that was not easy because at the time the word &quot;rock&quot; was a slang for &quot;sex&quot;, which many people believed the song implied. In 1950, Brown climbed his way up the charts once again with his song &quot;Hard Luck Blues&quot;. Other popular tunes by Roy Brown include &quot;Boogie at Midnight&quot;, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Love Nobody&quot;, &quot;Long About Sundown&quot;, &quot;Cadillac Baby&quot;, &quot;Party Doll&quot;, &quot;Let the Four Winds Blow&quot;, and &quot;Saturday Night&quot;.

=== Dave Bartholomew ===

Dave Bartholomew was a bandleader and trumpet player. In the early stages of his career, between 1939 and 1942, he played on the SS &quot;Capitol&quot; riverboat with Fats Pichon. Toward the end of his residency, Pichon resigned to take a solo gig at the Old Absinthe House in New Orleans. Bartholomew took over the riverboat band until he was drafted in 1942. While serving in the army, he learned how to arrange music as a member of the 196th AGF band. Upon discovering his passion for arranging and band leading, he was eager to return to New Orleans and make a name for himself. In 1949, Bartholomew and his band recorded the hit song &quot;Country Boy&quot;, while signed with DeLuxe. His true calling however, was to be involved with music production. He established himself as a band leader who arranged, produced, and scouted talent. During the 1950s, Bartholomew co-wrote most of the hits coming out of New Orleans.

=== Paul Gayten ===

Paul Gayten moved with his trio to New Orleans in his early twenties and established a residency at the Club Robin Hood. In 1947, his band recorded the two R&amp;B hits &quot;True (You Don&#x27;t Love Me)&quot; and &quot;Since I Fell for You&quot; with singer Annie Laurie for DeLuxe. When DeLuxe Records was bought out by King Records, the Braun brothers placed a new focus on Gayten&#x27;s production skills. Soon after, he became the director for Chess Records.

=== Smiley Lewis ===

Overton Amos Lemons, also known as Smiley Lewis, was known for singing and playing guitar at nearly every venue in New Orleans early in his career. He had an extensive vocal range and a deep voice that could fill a room without any amplification. After the war, he formed a trio with Herman Seals and Tuts Washington. The two became very popular locally. While scouting for talent, the Braun brothers were impressed by Smiley and signed them to DeLuxe in 1947. Three years later, he signed to Imperial Records whom he worked with for ten years. He found moderate success with his songs &quot;I Hear You Knockin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;The Bells Are Ringing&quot;. He was overshadowed by Fats Domino who was also signed to Imperial and achieved national recognition for his cover of &quot;I Hear You Knockin&#x27;&quot;. Elvis Presley&#x27;s hit &quot;One Night (of Love)&quot;, was originally recorded by Lewis and was titled, &quot;One Night (of Sin)&quot;. Similarly, Gale Storm&#x27;s cover of &quot;I Hear You Knockin&#x27;&quot; made &quot;Billboard&#x27;s&quot; Hot 100 Charts.

=== Fats Domino ===

In 1949, Dave Bartholomew and Lew Chudd visited the Hideaway Club to listen to Fats Domino sing. They were impressed with his version of &quot;Junkers Blues&quot; and immediately signed him to Imperial Records. That same year, Domino did his first recording session at the J&amp;M studio under the direction of Dave Bartholomew. Of the eight songs that were cut during the session, &quot;The Fat Man&quot; was chosen as Domino&#x27;s first big hit. A distinguishing element of the R&amp;B hit was Domino&#x27;s horn-like scat singing.

Following the success of &quot;The Fat Man&quot;, Domino toured with Jewel King and Dave Bartholomew&#x27;s band. When his song &quot;Goin&#x27; Home&quot; reached number one in the R&amp;B charts in 1952, his status as a star was confirmed. The biggest hit of his career however, was &quot;Blueberry Hill&quot;. Between the years of 1950 and 1955, he continued to make the R&amp;B charts over a dozen times. In 1956, he was the first black artist to make an appearance on the Steve Allen Show. He would later make appearances on the Perry Como Show, The Big Beat, and Dick Clark&#x27;s American Bandstand.

Domino&#x27;s voice was a unique blend of creole intonations, nasal scat singing, and a warm tone. He was known for using triplet piano figures in many of his songs. The &quot;New Orleans&quot; sound is heard in his cover of Smiley Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, with his combination of parade rhythms and barrelhouse blues. Fats Domino was described by Dave Bartholomew as the &quot;cornerstone&quot; of Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll.

== Notable record labels and producers ==
=== Cosimo Matassa ===

Cosimo Matassa was the leading record producer in New Orleans between 1940 and 1960. He created the &quot;cosimo sound&quot; with guitar, baritone saxophone, and tenor saxophone doubling the bass line. He also owned J&amp;M Studio and Jazz City studio, where he recorded nearly all R&amp;B hits in New Orleans between 1940-1960.

=== DeLuxe Records ===
David and Julian Braun, also known as the Braun brothers, owned an independent record label called &quot;DeLuxe&quot; which was based in Linden, New Jersey. Seeing that New Orleans was overflowing with talent, they decided to visit the city in 1947 with hopes of signing some new artists. DeLuxe signed Dave Bartholomew, Paul Gayten, Smiley Lewis, Roy Brown, and Annie Laurie. In 1949 DeLuxe Records was bought out by Syd Nathan, owner of King Records.

=== Imperial Records ===
Lew Chudd founded Imperial Records in 1947. During its early years, the label centered around country music and west coast jump bands. Looking to expand his business, Chudd reached out to Dave Bartholomew. They decided that they would work together and explore the up-and-coming R&amp;B scene. They recorded their first R&amp;B studio session with Jewel King and Tommy Ridgley at J&amp;M studio.

<doc id="172228" wikidata="Q157018" url="?curid=172228" title="Transrapid">
<text>Transrapid () is a German-developed high-speed monorail train using magnetic levitation. Planning for the system started in the late 1960s, with a test facility in Emsland, Germany inaugurated in 1983. In 1991, technical readiness for application was approved by the Deutsche Bundesbahn in cooperation with renowned universities.

The last version, the 2007-built Transrapid 09, is designed for a cruising speed of and allows acceleration and deceleration of approximately .

In 2002, the first commercial implementation was completed – the Shanghai Maglev Train, which connects the city of Shanghai&#x27;s rapid transit network to Shanghai Pudong International Airport. The Transrapid system has not yet been deployed on a long-distance intercity line.

The system was developed and marketed by Siemens and ThyssenKrupp, as well as other, mostly German companies.

In 2006, a Transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle on the German test track, leading to 23 fatalities.

In 2011, the Emsland test track closed down when its operating license expired. In early 2012, demolition and reconversion of the entire Emsland site including the factory was approved, but has been delayed until late 2023 because of concepts for usage as a Hyperloop test track or a maglev track for the Chinese CRRC Maglev.

==Technology==

===Levitation===
The super-speed Transrapid maglev system has no wheels, no axles, no gear transmissions, no steel rails, and no overhead electrical pantographs. The maglev vehicles do not roll on wheels; rather, they hover above the track guideway, using the attractive magnetic force between two linear arrays of electromagnetic coils—one side of the coil on the vehicle, the other side in the track guideway, which function together as a magnetic dipole. During levitation and travelling operation, the Transrapid maglev vehicle floats on a frictionless magnetic cushion with no mechanical contact whatsoever with the track guideway. On-board vehicle electronic systems measure the dipole gap distance 100,000 times per second to guarantee the clearance between the coils attached to the underside of the guideway and the magnetic portion of the vehicle wrapped around the guideway edges. With this precise, constantly updated electronic control, the dipole gap remains nominally constant at . When levitated, the maglev vehicle has about of clearance above the guideway surface.

The Transrapid maglev vehicle requires less power to hover than it needs to run its on-board air conditioning equipment.

In Transrapid vehicle versions TR08 and earlier, when travelling at speeds below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical connections to the track guideway. At vehicle speeds above , all on-board power was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the track&#x27;s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new energy transmission system, version TR09, has since been developed for Transrapid, in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track guideway for their on-board power needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.

In case of power failure of the track&#x27;s propulsion system, the maglev vehicle can use on-board backup batteries to temporarily power the vehicle&#x27;s levitation system.

===Propulsion===
The Transrapid maglev system uses a synchronous &quot;longstator&quot; linear motor for both propulsion and braking. It works like a rotating electric motor whose stator is &quot;unrolled&quot; along the underside of the guideway; instead of producing torque (rotation) it produces a linear force along its length. The electromagnets in the maglev vehicle which lift it also work as the equivalent of the excitation portion (rotor) of this linear electric motor. Since the magnetic travelling field works in only one direction, if there were to be several maglev trains on a given track section, they would all travel in the same direction thereby reducing the possibility of collision between moving trains.

===Energy requirements===
The normal energy consumption of the Transrapid is approximately per section for levitation and travel, and vehicle control. The drag coefficient of the Transrapid is about 0.26. The aerodynamic drag of the vehicle, which has a frontal cross section of , requires a power consumption, at or cruising speed, given by the following formula:

formula_1

formula_2

Power consumption compares favourably with other high-speed rail systems. With an efficiency of 0.85, the power required is about 4.2 MW. Energy consumption for levitation and guidance purposes equates to approximately 1.7 kW/t. As the propulsion system is also capable of functioning in reverse, energy is transferred back into the electrical grid during braking. An exception to this is when an emergency stop is performed using the emergency landing skids beneath the vehicle, although this method of bringing the vehicle to a stop is intended only as a last resort should it be impossible or undesirable to keep the vehicle levitating on back-up power to a natural halt.

===Market segment and historical parallels===
Compared to classical railway lines, Transrapid allows higher speeds and gradients with less weathering and lower energy consumption and maintenance needs. The Transrapid track is more flexible, and more easily adapted to specific geographical circumstances than a classical train system. Cargo is restricted to a maximum payload of per car. Transrapid allows maximum speeds of , placing it between conventional high speed trains () and air traffic (). The magnetic field generator, an important part of the engine being a part of the track, limits the system capacity.

From a competition standpoint, the Transrapid is a proprietary solution. The track being a part of the engine, only the single-source Transrapid vehicles and infrastructure can be operated. There is no multisourcing foreseen concerning vehicles or the highly complicated crossings and switches. Unlike classical railways or other infrastructure networks, as jointly administrated by the Federal Network Agency (Bundesnetzagentur) in Germany, a Transrapid system does not allow any direct competition.

===Ecological impact===
The Transrapid is an electrically driven, clean, high-speed, high-capacity means of transport able to build up point-to-point passenger connections in geographically challenged surroundings. This has to be set in comparison with the impact on heritage and or landscape protection areas (compare Waldschlösschen Bridge). Any impact of emissions has to take into account the source of electrical energy. The reduced expense, noise and vibration of a people-only Transrapid system versus a cargo train track is not directly comparable. The reuse of existing tracks and the interfacing with existing networks is limited. The Transrapid indirectly competes for resources, space and tracks in urban and city surroundings with classical urban transport systems and high speed trains.

===Comparative costs===
====Track construction cost====
The fully elevated Shanghai Maglev was built at a cost 
of US$1.33 billion over a length of including trains and stations. Thus the cost per km for dual track was US$43.6 million, including trains and stations. This was the first commercial use of the technology. Since then conventional fast rail track has been mass-produced in China for between US$4.6 and US$30.8 million per kilometer, mostly in rural areas. (See High-speed rail in China).

In 2008 Transrapid Australia quoted the Victoria State Government A$34 million per kilometer for dual track. This assumed 50% of the track was at grade and 50% was elevated. In comparison, the Regional Rail Link built in Victoria cost around A$5 billion, or A$105 million per kilometer, including two stations.

From the above it is not possible to say whether Transrapid or conventional fast rail track would be cheaper for a particular application.

The higher operating speed of the maglev system will result in more passengers being delivered over the same distance in a set time. The ability of the Transrapid system to handle tighter turns and steeper gradients could heavily influence a cost comparison for a particular project.

====Train purchase cost====
In 2008, Transrapid Australia quoted the Victorian State Government between A$16.5 million (commuter) and A$20 million (luxury) per trains section or carriage. Due to the width of the Transrapid carriages they have a floor area of about . This works out at between A$179,000 and A$217,000 per square meter.

In comparison, InterCityExpress which are also built by Siemens cost about A$6 million per carriage. Due to the width of the ICE carriages they have a floor area of about . This works out at about A$83,000 per square meter.

This shows Transrapid train sets are likely to cost over twice as much as ICE 3 conventional fast rail train sets at this time. However, each Transrapid train set is more than twice as efficient due to their faster operating speed and acceleration according to UK Ultraspeed. In their case study only 44% as many Transrapid train sets are needed to deliver the same number of passengers as conventional high-speed trains.

====Operational cost====
Transrapid claims their system has very low maintenance costs compared to conventional high speed rail systems due to the non-contact nature of their system.

==Implementations==

===China===

The only commercial implementation so far was in 2000, when the Chinese government ordered a Transrapid track to be built connecting Shanghai to its Pudong International Airport.
It was inaugurated in 2002 and regular daily trips started in March 2004. The travel speed is , which the Maglev train maintains for 50 seconds as the short, track only allows the cruising speed to be maintained for a short time before deceleration must begin. The average number of riders per day (14 hours of operation) is about 7,500, while the maximum seating capacity per train is 440. A second class ticket price of about 50 RMB (renminbi) (about 6 euro) is four times the price of the airport bus and ten times more expensive than a comparable underground ticket.

The project was sponsored by the German Hermes loans with DM 200 million. The total cost is believed to be $1.33 billion.

A planned extension of the line to Shanghai Hongqiao Airport () and onward to the city of Hangzhou () has been repeatedly delayed. Originally planned to be ready for Expo 2010, final approval was granted on 18 August 2008, and construction was scheduled to start in 2010 for completion in 2014. However the plan was cancelled, possibly due to the building of the high speed Shanghai–Hangzhou Passenger Railway.

===Germany===

The Emsland test facility was the only Transrapid track in Germany. It has been deactivated, and is scheduled to be disassembled. Nevertheless, there are plans to either use it as a test facility for the CRRC 600 or to reconstruct it in order to serve as a Hyperloop track.

==Proposed systems==
===Iran===
In 2007, Iran and a German company reached an agreement on using maglev trains to link the cities of Tehran and Mashhad. The agreement was signed at the Mashhad International Fair site between Iranian Ministry of Roads and Transportation and the German company. Munich-based Schlegel Consulting Engineers said they had signed the contract with the Iranian ministry of transport and the governor of Mashad. &quot;We have been mandated to lead a German consortium in this project,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;We are in a preparatory phase.&quot; The next step will be to assemble a consortium, a process that is expected to take place &quot;in the coming months,&quot; the spokesman said. The project could be worth between 10 billion and 12 billion euros, the Schlegel spokesman said. Siemens and ThyssenKrupp, the developers of a high-speed maglev train, called the Transrapid, both said they were unaware of the proposal. The Schlegel spokesman said Siemens and ThyssenKrupp were currently &quot;not involved&quot; in the consortium.

===Switzerland===
In 2011 SwissRapide AG in co-operation with the SwissRapide Consortium was developing and promoting an above-ground magnetic levitation (Maglev) monorail system, based on the Transrapid technology. The first projects planned were the lines Bern–Zürich, Lausanne–Geneva as well as Zürich–Winterthur. 

=== United States ===

==== Colorado I-70 ====
Transrapid is one of a number of companies seeking to build a high speed transit system parallel to the I-70 Interstate in the US state of Colorado. Submissions put forward say that maglev offers significantly better performance than rail given the harsh climate and terrain. No technology has been preferred as of November 2013, though construction slated to begin in 2020.

==== Los Angeles to Las Vegas ====

The California–Nevada Interstate Maglev project is a proposed 269 mi (433 km) line from Las Vegas, Nevada to Anaheim, California. One segment would run from Las Vegas to Primm, Nevada, with proposed service to the Las Vegas area&#x27;s forthcoming Ivanpah Valley Airport. The top speed would be 310 mph (500 km/h). In August 2014 the backers of the scheme were seeking to revive interest in it.

==== Other ====
There have been several other evaluations conducted in the US including Washington DC to Baltimore, Chattanooga to Atlanta and Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. So far no project has started construction. See list of maglev train proposals in the United States.

===Canary Islands===
A two line, 120-kilometers (75-mile) long system has been proposed for the island of Tenerife, which is visited by five million tourists per year. It would connect the island capital Santa Cruz in the north with Costa Adeje in the south and Los Realejos in the northwest with a maximum speed of 270 km/h (169 mph). The estimated cost is €3 billion. Transrapid has advantages over a conventional rail plans which would require 35% of its route in tunnels because of the steep terrain on the island.

==Rejected systems==

===Germany===

====High-speed competition====
The Transrapid originated as one of several competing concepts for new land-based high-speed public transportation developed in Germany. In this competition, the Transrapid primarily competed with the InterCityExpress (ICE), a high-speed rail system based on &quot;traditional&quot; railway technology. The ICE “won” in that it was adopted nationwide in Germany, however Transrapid development continued. A number of studies for possible Transrapid lines were conducted after the ICE had entered service, including a long-distance line from Hamburg to Berlin.

====Munich link====
The most recent German Transrapid line project, and the one that came closest to being built, having previously been approved, was an airport connection track from Munich Central Station to Munich Airport, a project. The connection between the train station and airport was close to being built, but was cancelled on 27 March 2008 by the German government, due to a massive overrun in costs. Prior to the cancellation, the governing party, the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU), faced internal and local resistance, in particular from communities along the proposed route. The CSU had planned to position Transrapid as an example of future technology and innovation in Bavaria. German federal transport minister Wolfgang Tiefensee announced the decision after a crisis meeting in Berlin at which industry representatives reportedly revealed that costs had risen from €1.85 billion to well over €3 billion ($4.7 billion). This rise in projected costs, however was mostly due to the cost estimates of the construction of the tunnel and related civil engineering after the designated operator Deutsche Bahn AG shifted most of the risk-sharing towards its subcontractors - and not due to the cost of the maglev technology.

===United Kingdom===
The Transrapid was rejected in 2007 by the UK government for a maglev link called UK Ultraspeed between London and Glasgow, via Birmingham, Liverpool/Manchester, Leeds, Teesside, Newcastle and Edinburgh. 

==Incidents==

===September 2006 accident===
On 22 September 2006, a Transrapid train collided with a maintenance vehicle at on the test track in Lathen, Germany. The maintenance vehicle destroyed the first section of the train, then lifted off the track to complete two full rotations before landing in a pile of pre-exploded debris. This was the first major accident involving a Transrapid train. The news media reported 23 fatalities and that several people were severely injured, these being the first fatalities on any maglev. The accident was caused by human error with the first train being allowed to leave the station before the maintenance vehicle had moved off the track. This situation could be avoided in a production environment by installing an automatic collision avoidance system.

===SMT fire accident===
On 11 August 2006, a Transrapid train running on the Shanghai Maglev Line caught fire. The fire was quickly put out by Shanghai&#x27;s firefighters. It was reported that the vehicle&#x27;s on-board batteries may have caused the fire.

==Alleged theft of Transrapid technology==
In April 2006, new announcements by Chinese officials planning to cut maglev rail costs by a third stirred some strong comments by various German officials and more diplomatic statements of concern from Transrapid officials. Deutsche Welle reported that the &quot;China Daily&quot; had quoted the State Council encouraging engineers to &quot;learn and absorb foreign advanced technologies while making further innovations.&quot; The Chinese deny any technology plagiarism. The China Aviation Industry Corporation has said the new Chinese &quot;Zhui Feng&quot; maglev train is not dependent on foreign technology. They also claim it is much lighter than the Transrapid product and features a much more advanced design. The &quot;Zhui Feng&quot; is a low speed maglev design currently in use on the Changsha Maglev Express.

<text>West Coast blues is a type of blues music influenced by jazz and jump blues, with strong piano-dominated sounds and jazzy guitar solos, which originated from Texas blues players who relocated to California in the 1940s. West Coast blues also features smooth, honey-toned vocals, frequently crossing into rhythm and blues territory.

==Texas and the West Coast==
Texans who played here included Pee Wee Crayton and T-Bone Walker.

Little Willie Littlefield was a R&amp;B and boogie-woogie pianist and singer whose early recordings helped forge a vital link between boogie-woogie and rock and roll.

<doc id="172232" wikidata="Q208629" url="?curid=172232" title="Oltenia">
<text>Oltenia (, also called Lesser Wallachia in antiquated versions – with the alternative Latin names , , and between 1718 and 1739 – is a historical province and geographical region of Romania in western Wallachia. It is situated between the Danube, the Southern Carpathians and the Olt river.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
Initially inhabited by Dacians, Oltenia was incorporated in the Roman Empire (106, at the end of the Dacian Wars; &quot;see Roman Dacia&quot;). In 129, during Hadrian&#x27;s rule, it formed Dacia Inferior, one of the two divisions of the province (together with Dacia Superior, in today&#x27;s Transylvania); Marcus Aurelius&#x27; administrative reform made Oltenia one of the three new divisions (&quot;tres Daciae&quot;) as Dacia Malvensis, its capital and chief city being named Romula. It was colonized with veterans of the Roman legions. The Romans withdrew their administration south of the Danube at the end of the 3rd century and Oltenia was ruled by the &quot;foederati&quot; Germanic Goths. In the late 4th century Oltenia came under the rule of the Taifals before invasion by the Huns.

=== Middle Ages ===
From 681, with some interruptions, it was part of the Bulgarian Empire (see Bulgarian lands across the Danube).

In 1233, the Kingdom of Hungary formed the Banate of Severin in the western part of the region that would persist until the 1526 Battle of Mohács.

Around 1247, a polity emerged in Oltenia under the rule of Litovoi. The rise of the medieval state of Wallachia followed in the 14th century, and the voivode (Prince of Wallachia) was represented in Oltenia by a ban - &quot;the Great Ban of Craiova&quot; (with seat in Craiova after it was moved from Strehaia). This came to be considered the greatest office in Wallachian hierarchy, and one that was held most by members of the Craiovești family, from the late 15th century to about 1550. The title would continue to exist up until 1831.

During the 15th century, Wallachia had to accept the Ottoman suzerainty and to pay an annual tribute to keep its autonomy as a vassal. From the Craiovești family, many bans cooperated with the Turks. However, many rulers, including the Oltenian-born Michael the Brave, fought against the Ottomans, giving Wallachia brief periods of independence.

=== Modern times ===

After 1716, the Ottomans decided to cease choosing the voivodes from among the Wallachian boyars, and to appoint foreign governors. As the governors were Orthodox Greeks living in Phanar, Constantinople, this period is known as the Phanariote regime.
Two years later, in 1718 under the terms of the Treaty of Passarowitz, Oltenia was split from Wallachia and annexed by the Habsburg monarchy as the Banat of Craiova (&quot;de facto&quot;, it was under Austrian occupation by 1716); in 1737, it was returned to Wallachia under Prince Constantine Mavrocordatos (&quot;see Austro-Turkish War of 1716–1718 and Austro-Russian–Turkish War (1735–1739)&quot;). Under the occupation, Oltenia was the only part of the Danubian Principalities (with the later exception of Bukovina) to experience Enlightened absolutism and Austrian administration, although these were met by considerable and mounting opposition from conservative boyars. While welcomed at first as liberators, the Austrians quickly disenchanted the inhabitants by imposing rigid administrative, fiscal, judicial and political reforms which were meant to centralize and integrate the territory (antagonizing both ends of the social spectrum: withdrawing privileges from the nobility and enforcing taxes for peasants).

In 1761, the residence of Bans was moved to Bucharest, in a move towards centralism (a &quot;kaymakam&quot; represented the boyars in Craiova). It remained there until the death of the last Ban, Barbu Văcărescu, in 1832.

In 1821, Oltenia and Gorj County were at the center of Tudor Vladimirescu&#x27;s uprising (&quot;see Wallachian uprising of 1821&quot;). Vladimirescu initially gathered his Pandurs in Padeș and relied on a grid of fortified monasteries such as Tismana and Strehaia.

== Symbols ==

The traditional heraldic symbol of Oltenia, also understood to represent Banat, is part of the coat of arms of Romania (lower &quot;dexter&quot;): on &quot;gules&quot; field, an &quot;or&quot; lion rampant, facing &quot;dexter&quot;, holding a sword, and standing over an &quot;or&quot; bridge (Apollodorus of Damascus Bridge at Drobeta Turnu Severin) and stylised waves.

Since its promulgation on 13 April 2017, Oltenia Day is officially celebrated on 21 March.

== Geography ==

Oltenia is part of the Sud - Vest development region. It entirely includes the counties of Gorj and Dolj and parts of the counties of Mehedinți (mainly in Oltenia, but the western part belongs to Banat), Vâlcea (part east of the Olt river is in Muntenia, a small part in the north-east lies in Transylvania), Olt (the western half, the former Romanați county) and Teleorman (only the commune Islaz).

Oltenia&#x27;s main city and seat for a majority of the late Middle Ages is Craiova. The first medieval seat of Oltenia was Turnu Severin, anciently called Drobeta, in the Banate of Severin. That city is located near the site of Trajan&#x27;s Bridge, built by Apollodorus of Damascus for Emperor Trajan in his conquest of the region.
