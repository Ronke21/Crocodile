<text>In mechanics and geometry, the 3D rotation group, often denoted [[special orthogonal group|SO]](3), is the group of all rotations about the origin of three-dimensional Euclidean space formula_1 under the operation of composition.

By definition, a rotation about the origin is a transformation that preserves the origin, Euclidean distance (so it is an isometry), and orientation (i.e., &quot;handedness&quot; of space). Composing two rotations results in another rotation, every rotation has a unique inverse rotation, and the identity map satisfies the definition of a rotation. Owing to the above properties (along composite rotations&#x27; associative property), the set of all rotations is a group under composition.

Every non-trivial rotation is determined by its axis of rotation (a line through the origin) and its angle of rotation. Rotations are not commutative (for example, rotating &quot;R&quot; 90° in the x-y plane followed by &quot;S&quot; 90° in the y-z plane is not the same as &quot;S&quot; followed by &quot;R&quot;), making the 3D rotation group a nonabelian group. Moreover, the rotation group has a natural structure as a manifold for which the group operations are smoothly differentiable, so it is in fact a Lie group. It is compact and has dimension 3.

Rotations are linear transformations of formula_1 and can therefore be represented by matrices once a basis of formula_1 has been chosen. Specifically, if we choose an orthonormal basis of formula_1, every rotation is described by an orthogonal 3 × 3 matrix (i.e., a 3 × 3 matrix with real entries which, when multiplied by its transpose, results in the identity matrix) with determinant 1. The group SO(3) can therefore be identified with the group of these matrices under matrix multiplication. These matrices are known as &quot;special orthogonal matrices&quot;, explaining the notation SO(3).

The group SO(3) is used to describe the possible rotational symmetries of an object, as well as the possible orientations of an object in space. Its representations are important in physics, where they give rise to the elementary particles of integer spin.

==Length and angle==
Besides just preserving length, rotations also preserve the angles between vectors. This follows from the fact that the standard dot product between two vectors u and v can be written purely in terms of length (see the law of cosines):
formula_5

It follows that every length-preserving linear transformation in formula_1 preserves the dot product, and thus the angle between vectors. Rotations are often defined as linear transformations that preserve the inner product on formula_1, which is equivalent to requiring them to preserve length. See classical group for a treatment of this more general approach, where appears as a special case.

==Orthogonal and rotation matrices==
Every rotation maps an orthonormal basis of formula_1 to another orthonormal basis. Like any linear transformation of finite-dimensional vector spaces, a rotation can always be represented by a matrix. Let be a given rotation. With respect to the standard basis of formula_1 the columns of are given by . Since the standard basis is orthonormal, and since preserves angles and length, the columns of form another orthonormal basis. This orthonormality condition can be expressed in the form

:formula_10

where denotes the transpose of and is the identity matrix. Matrices for which this property holds are called orthogonal matrices. The group of all orthogonal matrices is denoted , and consists of all proper and improper rotations.

In addition to preserving length, proper rotations must also preserve orientation. A matrix will preserve or reverse orientation according to whether the determinant of the matrix is positive or negative. For an orthogonal matrix , note that implies , so that . The subgroup of orthogonal matrices with determinant is called the &quot;special orthogonal group&quot;, denoted .

Thus every rotation can be represented uniquely by an orthogonal matrix with unit determinant. Moreover, since composition of rotations corresponds to matrix multiplication, the rotation group is isomorphic to the special orthogonal group .

Improper rotations correspond to orthogonal matrices with determinant , and they do not form a group because the product of two improper rotations is a proper rotation.

==Group structure==
The rotation group is a group under function composition (or equivalently the product of linear transformations). It is a subgroup of the general linear group consisting of all invertible linear transformations of the real 3-space formula_1.

Furthermore, the rotation group is nonabelian. That is, the order in which rotations are composed makes a difference. For example, a quarter turn around the positive &quot;x&quot;-axis followed by a quarter turn around the positive &quot;y&quot;-axis is a different rotation than the one obtained by first rotating around &quot;y&quot; and then &quot;x&quot;.

The orthogonal group, consisting of all proper and improper rotations, is generated by reflections. Every proper rotation is the composition of two reflections, a special case of the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem.

===Complete classification of finite subgroups===
The finite subgroups of formula_12 are completely classified.

Every finite subgroup is isomorphic to either an element of one of two countably infinite families of planar isometries: the cyclic groups formula_13 or the dihedral groups formula_14, or to one of three other groups: the tetrahedral group formula_15, the octahedral group formula_16, or the icosahedral group formula_17.

==Axis of rotation==

Every nontrivial proper rotation in 3 dimensions fixes a unique 1-dimensional linear subspace of formula_1 which is called the &quot;axis of rotation&quot; (this is Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem). Each such rotation acts as an ordinary 2-dimensional rotation in the plane orthogonal to this axis. Since every 2-dimensional rotation can be represented by an angle &quot;φ&quot;, an arbitrary 3-dimensional rotation can be specified by an axis of rotation together with an angle of rotation about this axis. (Technically, one needs to specify an orientation for the axis and whether the rotation is taken to be clockwise or counterclockwise with respect to this orientation).

For example, counterclockwise rotation about the positive &quot;z&quot;-axis by angle &quot;φ&quot; is given by

:formula_19

Given a unit vector n in formula_1 and an angle &quot;φ&quot;, let &quot;R&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;, n) represent a counterclockwise rotation about the axis through n (with orientation determined by n). Then

* &quot;R&quot;(0, n) is the identity transformation for any n
* &quot;R&quot;(&quot;φ&quot;, n) = &quot;R&quot;(−&quot;φ&quot;, −n)
* &quot;R&quot;( + &quot;φ&quot;, n) = &quot;R&quot;( − &quot;φ&quot;, −n).

Using these properties one can show that any rotation can be represented by a unique angle &quot;φ&quot; in the range 0 ≤ φ ≤ and a unit vector n such that
* n is arbitrary if &quot;φ&quot; = 0
* n is unique if 0 &lt; &quot;φ&quot; &lt; 
* n is unique up to a sign if &quot;φ&quot; = (that is, the rotations &quot;R&quot;(, ±n) are identical).
In the next section, this representation of rotations is used to identify SO(3) topologically with three-dimensional real projective space.

==Topology==

The Lie group SO(3) is diffeomorphic to the real projective space formula_21

Consider the solid ball in formula_1 of radius (that is, all points of formula_1 of distance or less from the origin). Given the above, for every point in this ball there is a rotation, with axis through the point and the origin, and rotation angle equal to the distance of the point from the origin. The identity rotation corresponds to the point at the center of the ball. Rotations through an angle between 0 and (not including either) are on the same axis at the same distance. Rotation through angles between 0 and − correspond to the point on the same axis and distance from the origin but on the opposite side of the origin. The one remaining issue is that the two rotations through and through − are the same. So we identify (or &quot;glue together&quot;) antipodal points on the surface of the ball. After this identification, we arrive at a topological space homeomorphic to the rotation group.

Indeed, the ball with antipodal surface points identified is a smooth manifold, and this manifold is diffeomorphic to the rotation group. It is also diffeomorphic to the real 3-dimensional projective space formula_24 so the latter can also serve as a topological model for the rotation group.

These identifications illustrate that SO(3) is connected but not simply connected. As to the latter, in the ball with antipodal surface points identified, consider the path running from the &quot;north pole&quot; straight through the interior down to the south pole. This is a closed loop, since the north pole and the south pole are identified. This loop cannot be shrunk to a point, since no matter how it is deformed, the start and end point have to remain antipodal, or else the loop will &quot;break open&quot;. In terms of rotations, this loop represents a continuous sequence of rotations about the &quot;z&quot;-axis starting (by example) at the identity (center of the ball), through the south pole, jumping to the north pole and ending again at the identity rotation (i.e., a series of rotation through an angle &quot;φ&quot; where &quot;φ&quot; runs from 0 to 2).

Surprisingly, running through the path twice, i.e., running from the north pole down to the south pole, jumping back to the north pole (using the fact that north and south poles are identified), and then again running from the north pole down to the south pole, so that &quot;φ&quot; runs from 0 to 4, gives a closed loop which &quot;can&quot; be shrunk to a single point: first move the paths continuously to the ball&#x27;s surface, still connecting north pole to south pole twice. The second path can then be mirrored over to the antipodal side without changing the path at all. Now we have an ordinary closed loop on the surface of the ball, connecting the north pole to itself along a great circle. This circle can be shrunk to the north pole without problems. The plate trick and similar tricks demonstrate this practically.

The same argument can be performed in general, and it shows that the fundamental group of SO(3) is the cyclic group of order 2 (a fundamental group with two elements). In physics applications, the non-triviality (more than one element) of the fundamental group allows for the existence of objects known as spinors, and is an important tool in the development of the spin–statistics theorem.

The universal cover of SO(3) is a Lie group called Spin(3). The group Spin(3) is isomorphic to the special unitary group SU(2); it is also diffeomorphic to the unit 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3 and can be understood as the group of versors (quaternions with absolute value 1). The connection between quaternions and rotations, commonly exploited in computer graphics, is explained in quaternions and spatial rotations. The map from &quot;S&quot;3 onto SO(3) that identifies antipodal points of &quot;S&quot;3 is a surjective homomorphism of Lie groups, with kernel {±1}. Topologically, this map is a two-to-one covering map. (See the plate trick.)

==Connection between SO(3) and SU(2)==
In this section, we give two different constructions of a two-to-one and surjective homomorphism of SU(2) onto SO(3).

===Using quaternions of unit norm ===

The group is isomorphic to the quaternions of unit norm via a map given by
formula_25
restricted to formula_26 where formula_27, formula_28, formula_29, and formula_30, formula_31.

Let us now identify formula_1 with the span of formula_33. One can then verify that if formula_34 is in formula_1 and formula_36 is a unit quaternion, then
formula_37

Furthermore, the map formula_38 is a rotation of formula_39 Moreover, formula_40 is the same as formula_41. This means that there is a homomorphism from quaternions of unit norm to the 3D rotation group .

One can work this homomorphism out explicitly: the unit quaternion, , with
formula_42
is mapped to the rotation matrix
formula_43

This is a rotation around the vector by an angle , where and . The proper sign for is implied, once the signs of the axis components are fixed. The is apparent since both and map to the same .

===Using Möbius transformations===
The general reference for this section is . The points on the sphere

:formula_44

can, barring the north pole , be put into one-to-one bijection with points on the plane defined by , see figure. The map is called stereographic projection.

Let the coordinates on be . The line passing through and can be parametrized as

:formula_45

Demanding that the of formula_46 equals , one finds

:formula_47

We have formula_48 Hence the map

:formula_49

where, for later convenience, the plane is identified with the complex plane formula_50

For the inverse, write as

:formula_51

and demand to find and thus

:formula_52

If is a rotation, then it will take points on to points on by its standard action on the embedding space formula_39 By composing this action with one obtains a transformation of ,

:formula_54

Thus is a transformation of formula_55 associated to the transformation of formula_1.

It turns out that represented in this way by can be expressed as a matrix (where the notation is recycled to use the same name for the matrix as for the transformation of formula_55 it represents). To identify this matrix, consider first a rotation about the through an angle ,

:formula_58

Hence

:formula_59

which, unsurprisingly, is a rotation in the complex plane. In an analogous way, if is a rotation about the through an angle , then

:formula_60

which, after a little algebra, becomes

:formula_61

These two rotations, formula_62 thus correspond to bilinear transforms of , namely, they are examples of Möbius transformations.

A general Möbius transformation is given by

:formula_63

The rotations, formula_64 generate all of and the composition rules of the Möbius transformations show that any composition of formula_64 translates to the corresponding composition of Möbius transformations. The Möbius transformations can be represented by matrices

:formula_66

since a common factor of cancels.

For the same reason, the matrix is &quot;not&quot; uniquely defined since multiplication by has no effect on either the determinant or the Möbius transformation. The composition law of Möbius transformations follow that of the corresponding matrices. The conclusion is that each Möbius transformation corresponds to two matrices .

Using this correspondence one may write

:formula_67

These matrices are unitary and thus . In terms of Euler angles one finds for a general rotation

one has

 &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-i\frac{\phi}{2}}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2} &amp; i\sin\frac{\theta}{2}\\
i\sin\frac{\theta}{2} &amp; \cos\frac{\theta}{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{i\frac{\psi}{2}} &amp; 0\\
0 &amp; e^{-i\frac{\psi}{2}}
\end{pmatrix}\\
&amp;= \pm
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\theta}{2}e^{i\frac{\phi + \psi}{2}} &amp; i\sin\frac{\theta}{2}e^{i\frac{\phi - \psi}{2}}\\
i\sin\frac{\theta}{2}e^{-i\frac{\phi - \psi}{2}} &amp; \cos\frac{\theta}{2}e^{-i\frac{\phi + \psi}{2}}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;|}}

For the converse, consider a general matrix

:formula_68

Make the substitutions

:formula_69

With the substitutions, assumes the form of the right hand side (RHS) of (), which corresponds under to a matrix on the form of the RHS of () with the same . In terms of the complex parameters ,

:formula_70

To verify this, substitute for the elements of the matrix on the RHS of (). After some manipulation, the matrix assumes the form of the RHS of ().

It is clear from the explicit form in terms of Euler angles that the map

:formula_71

just described is a smooth, and surjective group homomorphism. It is hence an explicit description of the universal covering space of from the universal covering group .

==Lie algebra==
Associated with every Lie group is its Lie algebra, a linear space of the same dimension as the Lie group, closed under a bilinear alternating product called the Lie bracket. The Lie algebra of is denoted by formula_72 and consists of all skew-symmetric matrices. This may be seen by differentiating the orthogonality condition, . The Lie bracket of two elements of formula_72 is, as for the Lie algebra of every matrix group, given by the matrix commutator, , which is again a skew-symmetric matrix. The Lie algebra bracket captures the essence of the Lie group product in a sense made precise by the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula.

The elements of formula_72 are the &quot;infinitesimal generators&quot; of rotations, i.e., they are the elements of the tangent space of the manifold SO(3) at the identity element. If formula_75 denotes a counterclockwise rotation with angle φ about the axis specified by the unit vector formula_76 then

:formula_77

This can be used to show that the Lie algebra formula_72 (with commutator) is isomorphic to the Lie algebra formula_1 (with cross product). Under this isomorphism, an Euler vector formula_80 corresponds to the linear map formula_81 defined by formula_82

In more detail, most often a suitable basis for formula_72 as a vector space is

:formula_84

The commutation relations of these basis elements are,

:formula_85

which agree with the relations of the three standard unit vectors of formula_1 under the cross product.

As announced above, one can identify any matrix in this Lie algebra with an Euler vector formula_87

:formula_88

This identification is sometimes called the hat-map. Under this identification, the formula_72 bracket corresponds in formula_1 to the cross product,

:formula_91

The matrix identified with a vector formula_92 has the property that

:formula_93

where the left-hand side we have ordinary matrix multiplication. This implies formula_92 is in the null space of the skew-symmetric matrix with which it is identified, because formula_95

===A note on Lie algebras===

In Lie algebra representations, the group SO(3) is compact and simple of rank 1, and so it has a single independent Casimir element, a quadratic invariant function of the three generators which commutes with all of them. The Killing form for the rotation group is just the Kronecker delta, and so this Casimir invariant is simply the sum of the squares of the generators, formula_96 of the algebra
:formula_97
That is, the Casimir invariant is given by
:formula_98

For unitary irreducible representations , the eigenvalues of this invariant are real and discrete, and characterize each representation, which is finite dimensional, of dimensionality formula_99. That is, the eigenvalues of this Casimir operator are
:formula_100
where is integer or half-integer, and referred to as the spin or angular momentum.

So, the 3 × 3 generators L displayed above act on the triplet (spin 1) representation, while the 2 × 2 generators below, t, act on the doublet (spin-1/2) representation. By taking Kronecker products of with itself repeatedly, one may construct all higher irreducible representations . That is, the resulting generators for higher spin systems in three spatial dimensions, for arbitrarily large , can be calculated using these spin operators and ladder operators.

For every unitary irreducible representations there is an equivalent one, . All 
infinite-dimensional irreducible representations must be non-unitary, since the group is compact.

In quantum mechanics, the Casimir invariant is the &quot;angular-momentum-squared&quot; operator; integer values of spin characterize bosonic representations, while half-integer values fermionic representations. The antihermitian matrices used above are utilized as spin operators, after they are multiplied by , so they are now hermitian (like the Pauli matrices). Thus, in this language,
:formula_101
and hence
:formula_102

Explicit expressions for these are,
:formula_103
where is arbitrary and formula_104.

For example, the resulting spin matrices for spin 1 (formula_105) are
:formula_106

Note, however, how these are in an equivalent, but different basis, the spherical basis, than the above L in the Cartesian basis.

For higher spins, such as spin (formula_107):
:formula_108

For spin (formula_109),
:formula_110

=== Isomorphism with 𝖘𝖚(2) ===
The Lie algebras formula_72 and formula_112 are isomorphic. One basis for formula_112 is given by

:formula_114

These are related to the Pauli matrices by

:formula_115

The Pauli matrices abide by the physicists&#x27; convention for Lie algebras. In that convention, Lie algebra elements are multiplied by , the exponential map (below) is defined with an extra factor of in the exponent and the structure constants remain the same, but the &quot;definition&quot; of them acquires a factor of . Likewise, commutation relations acquire a factor of . The commutation relations for the formula_116 are

:formula_117

where is the totally anti-symmetric symbol with . The isomorphism between formula_72 and formula_112 can be set up in several ways. For later convenience, formula_72 and formula_112 are identified by mapping

:formula_122

and extending by linearity.

==Exponential map==
The exponential map for , is, since is a matrix Lie group, defined using the standard matrix exponential series,

:formula_123

For any skew-symmetric matrix , is always in . The proof uses the elementary properties of the matrix exponential

:formula_124

since the matrices and commute, this can be easily proven with the skew-symmetric matrix condition. This is not enough to show that is the corresponding Lie algebra for , and shall be proven separately.

The level of difficulty of proof depends on how a matrix group Lie algebra is defined. defines the Lie algebra as the set of matrices

:formula_125

in which case it is trivial. uses for a definition derivatives of smooth curve segments in through the identity taken at the identity, in which case it is harder.

For a fixed , is a one-parameter subgroup along a geodesic in . That this gives a one-parameter subgroup follows directly from properties of the exponential map.

The exponential map provides a diffeomorphism between a neighborhood of the origin in the and a neighborhood of the identity in the . For a proof, see Closed subgroup theorem.

The exponential map is surjective. This follows from the fact that every , since every rotation leaves an axis fixed (Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem), and is conjugate to a block diagonal matrix of the form

:formula_126

such that , and that

:formula_127

together with the fact that is closed under the adjoint action of , meaning that .

Thus, e.g., it is easy to check the popular identity

:formula_128

As shown above, every element is associated with a vector , where is a unit magnitude vector. Since is in the null space of , if one now rotates to a new basis, through some other orthogonal matrix , with as the axis, the final column and row of the rotation matrix in the new basis will be zero.

Thus, we know in advance from the formula for the exponential that must leave fixed. It is mathematically impossible to supply a straightforward formula for such a basis as a function of , because its existence would violate the hairy ball theorem; but direct exponentiation is possible, and yields

:formula_129

where formula_130 and formula_131. This is recognized as a matrix for a rotation around axis by the angle : cf. Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula.

== Logarithm map ==
Given , let formula_132 denote the antisymmetric part and let formula_133 Then, the logarithm of is given by

:formula_134

This is manifest by inspection of the mixed symmetry form of Rodrigues&#x27; formula,

:formula_135

where the first and last term on the right-hand side are symmetric.

== Uniform random sampling ==
formula_136 is doubly covered by the group of unit quaternions, which is isomorphic to the 3-sphere. Since the Haar measure on the unit quaternions is just the 3-area measure in 4 dimensions, the Haar measure on formula_136 is just the pushforward of the 3-area measure.

Consequently, generating a uniformly random rotation in formula_1 is equivalent to generating a uniformly random point on the 3-sphere. This can be accomplished by the followingformula_139

where formula_140 are uniformly random samples of formula_141.

== Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula ==

Suppose and in the Lie algebra are given. Their exponentials, and , are rotation matrices, which can be multiplied. Since the exponential map is a surjection, for some in the Lie algebra, , and one may tentatively write

:formula_142

for some expression in and . When and commute, then , mimicking the behavior of complex exponentiation.

The general case is given by the more elaborate BCH formula, a series expansion of nested Lie brackets. For matrices, the Lie bracket is the same operation as the commutator, which monitors lack of commutativity in multiplication. This general expansion unfolds as follows,

:formula_143

The infinite expansion in the BCH formula for reduces to a compact form,

:formula_144

for suitable trigonometric function coefficients .

The are given by
:formula_145
where

:formula_146

for

:formula_147

The inner product is the Hilbert–Schmidt inner product and the norm is the associated norm. Under the hat-isomorphism,

:formula_148

which explains the factors for and . This drops out in the expression for the angle. 
It is worthwhile to write this composite rotation generator as

:formula_149

to emphasize that this is a &quot;Lie algebra identity&quot;.

The above identity holds for all faithful representations of . The kernel of a Lie algebra homomorphism is an ideal, but , being simple, has no nontrivial ideals and all nontrivial representations are hence faithful. It holds in particular in the doublet or spinor representation. The same explicit formula thus follows in a simpler way through Pauli matrices, cf. the 2×2 derivation for SU(2).
The Pauli vector version of the same BCH formula is the somewhat simpler group composition law of SU(2),

:formula_150

where

:formula_151

the spherical law of cosines. (Note are angles, not the above.)

This is manifestly of the same format as above, 
:formula_152
with
:formula_153
so that

:formula_154

For uniform normalization of the generators in the Lie algebra involved, express the Pauli matrices in terms of -matrices, , so that 
:formula_155

To verify then these are the same coefficients as above, compute the ratios of the coefficients, 
:formula_156
Finally, given the identity . 
For the general case, one might use Ref.
The quaternion formulation of the composition of two rotations RB and RA also yields directly the rotation axis and angle of the composite rotation RC = RBRA.

Let the quaternion associated with a spatial rotation R is constructed from its rotation axis S and the rotation angle &quot;φ&quot; this axis. The associated quaternion is given by,

:formula_157

Then the composition of the rotation RR with RA is the rotation RC = RBRA with rotation axis and angle defined by the product of the quaternions

:formula_158

that is

:formula_159

Expand this product to obtain

:formula_160

Divide both sides of this equation by the identity, which is the law of cosines on a sphere,

:formula_161

and compute

:formula_162

This is Rodrigues&#x27; formula for the axis of a composite rotation defined in terms of the axes of the two rotations. He derived this formula in 1840 (see page 408).

The three rotation axes A, B, and C form a spherical triangle and the dihedral angles between the planes formed by the sides of this triangle are defined by the rotation angles.

== Infinitesimal rotations ==
==Realizations of rotations==

We have seen that there are a variety of ways to represent rotations:
* as orthogonal matrices with determinant 1,
* by axis and rotation angle
* in quaternion algebra with versors and the map 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3 → SO(3) (see quaternions and spatial rotations)
* in geometric algebra as a rotor
* as a sequence of three rotations about three fixed axes; see Euler angles.

== Spherical harmonics ==

The group of three-dimensional Euclidean rotations has an infinite-dimensional representation on the Hilbert space

:formula_163

where formula_164 are spherical harmonics. Its elements are square integrable complex-valued functions on the sphere. The inner product on this space is given by

If is an arbitrary square integrable function defined on the unit sphere , then it can be expressed as

where the expansion coefficients are given by

The Lorentz group action restricts to that of and is expressed as

This action is unitary, meaning that

The can be obtained from the of above using Clebsch–Gordan decomposition, but they are more easily directly expressed as an exponential of an odd-dimensional -representation (the 3-dimensional one is exactly ). In this case the space decomposes neatly into an infinite direct sum of irreducible odd finite-dimensional representations according to

This is characteristic of infinite-dimensional unitary representations of . If is an infinite-dimensional unitary representation on a separable Hilbert space, then it decomposes as a direct sum of finite-dimensional unitary representations. Such a representation is thus never irreducible. All irreducible finite-dimensional representations can be made unitary by an appropriate choice of inner product,

:formula_165

where the integral is the unique invariant integral over normalized to , here expressed using the Euler angles parametrization. The inner product inside the integral is any inner product on .

==Generalizations==
The rotation group generalizes quite naturally to &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space, formula_166 with its standard Euclidean structure. The group of all proper and improper rotations in &quot;n&quot; dimensions is called the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;), and the subgroup of proper rotations is called the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;), which is a Lie group of dimension .

In special relativity, one works in a 4-dimensional vector space, known as Minkowski space rather than 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Unlike Euclidean space, Minkowski space has an inner product with an indefinite signature. However, one can still define &quot;generalized rotations&quot; which preserve this inner product. Such generalized rotations are known as Lorentz transformations and the group of all such transformations is called the Lorentz group.

The rotation group SO(3) can be described as a subgroup of E+(3), the Euclidean group of direct isometries of Euclidean formula_39 This larger group is the group of all motions of a rigid body: each of these is a combination of a rotation about an arbitrary axis and a translation, or put differently, a combination of an element of SO(3) and an arbitrary translation.

In general, the rotation group of an object is the symmetry group within the group of direct isometries; in other words, the intersection of the full symmetry group and the group of direct isometries. For chiral objects it is the same as the full symmetry group.

<text>David Hartley (; baptized 21 June 1705 Old Style; died 28 August 1757) was an English philosopher and founder of the Associationist school of psychology.

==Early life and family history==
David Hartley was born in 1705 in the vicinity of Halifax, Yorkshire. His mother died three months after his birth. His father, an Anglican clergyman, died when David was fifteen. Hartley was educated at Bradford Grammar School and in 1722 was admitted as a Sizar to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he was a Rustat scholar. He received his BA in 1726 and MA in 1729. In April 1730 he became the first layperson to be Master of Magnus Grammar School (Magnus Church of England Academy), Newark, and it was there that he began to practise medicine. On 21 April 1730, Hartley married Alice Rowley (1705–31). The couple moved to Bury St Edmunds, and Alice died there giving birth to their son David Hartley (the Younger) (1731–1813). While in Bury, Hartley met his second wife, Elizabeth Packer (1713–78), the fifth child and only daughter of Robert Packer (died 1731) and Mary Winchcombe, a wealthy and influential family with estates in Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire, and Berkshire, including Donnington Castle House, Shellingford Manor and Bucklebury House, Berks. (Mary Winchcombe was the daughter of Sir Henry Winchcombe, Bart., and the sister of Frances, wife of Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke.) Despite the opposition of Elizabeth&#x27;s family, David and Elizabeth wed on 25 August 1735, after agreeing to a severe set of restrictions that kept the £5,000 Elizabeth received upon her marriage completely out of the hands of her husband. Their first child, Mary (1736–1803), was born eleven months later. In 1736 the family moved to London, and then in 1742 to Bath, Somerset. When Elizabeth&#x27;s last surviving elder brother died without issue in 1746, their son Winchcombe Henry (1740–94) inherited the family estates, making the family (though not Hartley himself) the possessors of significant wealth. Hartley died in Bath on 28 August 1757. He was buried at St John the Baptist Church, Old Sodbury, Gloucestershire.

==Education and professional career==
At Cambridge, Hartley studied with Nicholas Saunderson, who, though blind since infancy, became the fourth Lucasian Professor of Mathematics. Hartley was later instrumental in raising the subscription for the posthumous publication of Saunderson&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Algebra&quot; (1740). Upon graduation, Hartley declined to sign the Thirty-nine Articles, a requirement for ordination in the Church of England. Although one point at issue may have been the doctrine of the Trinity, Hartley&#x27;s main dissent from Anglican orthodoxy was his assent to universal reconciliation. Writing to his friend Joseph Lister in 1736, Hartley stated he believed &quot;[t]hat Universal Happiness is the Fundamental Doctrine both of Reason &amp; Scripture&quot;, adding that &quot;nothing is so irreconcilable [with] Reason as eternal Punishment, nothing so contrary to all the Intimations God has given us in his Works. Have you read Sr. Is. Newton’s Commt. upon Danl. &amp; the Apocalypse?&quot; For Hartley, on the gates of hell there could be no locks.

In the same letter to Lister, Hartley writes that &quot;a Man who disregards himself, who entirely abandons Self-Interest &amp; devotes his Labours to the Service of Mankind, or in that beautiful and expressive phrase of the Scriptures, &quot;who loves his neighbor as himself&quot; is sure to meet with private Happiness&quot;. This conviction became a guiding principle in Hartley&#x27;s life, and it led him to devote himself to a various philanthropic projects. These include the publication of Saunderson&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Algebra&quot; and the promotion of the shorthand system of his friend John Byrom (a system that Hartley believed could be a &quot;universal character&quot; and step toward the creation of a philosophical language). 

Shortly after turning to medicine, Hartley became an advocate of variola inoculation for smallpox. Variolation confers personal immunity, and if widespread would be a &quot;service to mankind&quot; by furthering herd immunity. However, deliberate infection with the smallpox virus ran the risk of disfigurement or death. (Queen Caroline, wife of George II, was an advocate and had three of their children variolated, but Jonathan Edwards died from it in 1758.) The public good, then, could appear to be at odds with private interest. In his first publication, &quot;Some Reasons why the Practice of Inoculation ought to be Introduced into the Town of Bury at Present&quot; (1733), Hartley developed a statistical argument to show that the conflict is only apparent, that being inoculated furthers both the public good and a person&#x27;s self-interest.

By the time of his move to London in 1736, Hartley was known by other campaigners of variolation, such as Hans Sloane and James Jurin, president of the Royal Society. He also had the support of important Whig families in Suffolk, notably of Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend (&#x27;Turnip&#x27; Townshend). Hartley&#x27;s daughter Mary wrote that &quot;the old Lord Townshend (then Secretary of State) treated him with as much kindness as he had had been an additional son, and all the sons and daughters as an additional brother&quot;. He was inducted into the Royal Society, and he also became a physician to Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, and his wife. In 1736 he offered to &quot;recommend&quot; John Byrom to George II.

By 1740, Hartley was known to every physician in London and to other medical men throughout Europe. He had thrown himself into a controversial attempt to harmonize private interest and public good. Hartley had started to experience symptoms of &quot;the stone&quot; (bladder stone) in early 1736. A bladder stone, sometimes as large as an egg, could function as a ball-cock on a toilet tank, causing an inability to urinate, excruciating pain, and sometimes death. (Benjamin Franklin, a sufferer, sometimes had to stand on his head to relieve himself.) Treatment by surgical removal (lithotomy) was a procedure many failed to survive.

Hartley thought a herbalist called Joanna Stephens had developed a lithontriptic, an oral medicine that would dissolve a stone &quot;in situ&quot;. He published &quot;Ten Cases of Persons who have Taken Mrs. Stephens’s Medicines for the Stone&quot; (1738), which includes an unsparing account of his own agonies. To make a proprietary medicine freely available to the public, Hartley convinced Parliament to pay Stephens £5,000 for her &quot;secret&quot;.

With Stephens&#x27;s recipe in hand, Hartley set to work with Stephen Hales, along with two colleagues in France, to locate the medicine&#x27;s chemically active ingredients. These were slaked lime (calcium hydroxide) and Alicant soap (predominantly potassium oleate, like other soaps an alkaline salt of a fatty acid). Hales had shown that some bladder stones rapidly dissolved in boiled soap-lye (caustic potash, potassium hydroxide). What was needed, then, was a safely ingestible preparation that would turn a person&#x27;s urine alkaline; and this, they concluded, is what the slaked lime and soap combination did. In 1739 Hales won the Copley Medal for his work, and the following year Hartley published their results in a Latin volume, &quot;De Lithontriptico&quot;, in Basel and Leiden, the latter being home at the time to the foremost medical school in Europe.

In 1742 Hartley and his family moved to Bath, Somerset. He continued to practise medicine, and he devoted himself to writing his major work, &quot;Observations on Man, His Frame, His Duty, and His Expectations&quot;, published in 1749 by Samuel Richardson.

He was a vegetarian.

==Observations on Man: &quot;A New and Most Extensive Science&quot;==
In the 18th century, &quot;Observations&quot; appears in the titles of scientific works – compare Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Experiments and Observations on Electricity&quot; (1751) and Joseph Priestley&#x27;s &quot;Experiments and Observations of Different Kinds of Air&quot; (1774). Priestley, Hartley&#x27;s champion, would declare that Hartley&#x27;s work &quot;contains a new and most extensive &quot;science. …&quot; [T]he study of it will be like entering upon a &quot;new world. …&quot;&quot; The science is the science of &quot;man&quot;, and the &quot;new world&quot; is the one embodied in the human &quot;frame&quot; itself.

The result, on the one hand, is a &quot;vast haystack of a book&quot;. As one would expect from a physician with an inquiring mind and active medical practice, Hartley draws together a wide range of observations – to name a few, on phantom limbs, savant syndrome, and the experiences and mental development of the blind and the deaf (&quot;OM&quot; 1, props. 34, 69, 78, 80, and 93).

On the other hand, just as Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation unified celestial and terrestrial mechanics, Hartley proposed a single &quot;law&quot; — &quot;association&quot; — to account for any and all observations of &quot;man&quot;. Hartley&#x27;s many observations are meant to be illustrations of the law.

Moreover, &quot;association&quot; has explanatory power. For example, in the section &quot;The Affections by which we rejoice at the Misery of Others&quot; (&quot;OM&quot; 1.1.4.97–98), Hartley presents a detailed analysis of the process by which an abused, bullied child becomes an abusive, bullying adult. He traces out how the child&#x27;s automatic gesture of raising an arm to ward off a blow becomes, through a series of associative substitutions, the fist the adult raises to strike a child. An initial defensive gesture becomes a general aggressive stance, and thus the source of the insulting words and threatening actions by which the adult &quot;goes on multiplying perpetually … the occasions of anger and the expressions of it&quot;.

Nonetheless, Hartley believed that it was no-one&#x27;s destiny to be permanently trapped in such a hell. He was, rather, a religious visionary, and his fundamental belief breathtakingly optimistic: that association &quot;has a tendency to reduce the state of those who have eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, back again to a paradisiacal one&quot; (OM 1.1.2.14, Cor. 9). From this vantage point, Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Observations on Man&quot; is a psychological epic, a story of &quot;paradise regained&quot; — but an epic describing, ultimately, the life of each human being.

==Theories==
Like John Locke, he asserted that, prior to sensation, the human mind is a blank slate. By a growth from simple sensations, those states of consciousness which appear most remote from sensation come into being. And the one law of growth of which Hartley took account was the law of contiguity, synchronous and successive. By this law he sought to explain, not only the phenomena of memory, which others had similarly explained before him, but also the phenomena of emotion, of reasoning, and of voluntary and involuntary action (see Association of Ideas). A friend, associate, and one of his chief advocates, was Joseph Priestley (1733–1804), the discoverer of oxygen. Priestley was one of the foremost scientists of his age.

=== Doctrine of vibrations ===
Hartley&#x27;s physical theory gave birth to the modern study of the intimate connection of physiological and psychical facts. He believed that sensation is the result of a vibration of the minute particles of the medullary substance of the nerves, to account for which he postulated, with Newton, a subtle elastic ether, rare in the interstices of solid bodies and in their close neighbourhood, and denser as it recedes from them. Pleasure is the result of moderate vibrations, pain of vibrations so violent as to break the continuity of the nerves. These vibrations leave behind them in the brain a tendency to fainter vibrations or &quot;vibratiuncles&quot; of a similar kind, which correspond to &quot;ideas of sensation.&quot; This accounts for memory.

=== Doctrine of associations ===
The course of reminiscence and of the thoughts generally, when not immediately dependent upon external sensation, is accounted for by the idea that there are always vibrations in the brain on account of its heat and the pulsation of its arteries. The nature of these vibrations is determined by each man&#x27;s past experience, and by the circumstances of the moment, which causes one or another tendency to prevail over the rest. Sensations which are often associated together become each associated with the ideas corresponding to the others; and the ideas corresponding to the associated sensations become associated together, sometimes so intimately that they form what appears to be a new simple idea, not without careful analysis resolvable into its component parts.

=== Free will ===
Starting from a detailed account of the phenomena of the senses, Hartley tried to show how, by the above laws, all the emotions, which he analyses with considerable skill, may be explained. Locke&#x27;s phrase &quot;association of ideas&quot; is employed throughout, &quot;idea&quot; being taken as including every mental state but sensation. He emphatically asserts the existence of pure disinterested sentiment, while declaring it to be a growth from the self-regarding feelings. Voluntary action is explained as the result of a firm connexion between a motion and a sensation or &quot;idea,&quot; and, on the physical side, between an &quot;ideal&quot; and a motory vibration. Therefore, in the Freewill controversy Hartley took his place as a determinist. It was only with reluctance, and when his speculations were nearly complete, that he came to a conclusion on this subject in accordance with his theory.

<doc id="173968" wikidata="Q1114941" url="?curid=173968" title="Thomas Holcroft">
<text>Thomas Holcroft (10 December 174523 March 1809) was an English dramatist, miscellanist, poet, novelist and translator. He was sympathetic to the early ideas of the French Revolution and helped Thomas Paine to publish the first part of &quot;The Rights of Man&quot;.

==Early life==
Holcroft was born in Orange Court, Leicester Fields, London. His father had a shoemaker&#x27;s shop and kept riding horses for hire, but he fell into difficulties and was reduced to hawking as a pedlar. The son accompanied his parents on their travels. He obtained work as a stable boy at Newmarket, at the stables of Hon. Richard Vernon, where he spent his evenings chiefly on miscellaneous reading and the study of music. He gradually obtained a knowledge of French, German and Italian.

When Holcroft&#x27;s job at the stables came to an end, he returned to assist his father, who had resumed his trade of shoemaker in London. Around 1765, he became a teacher in a small school in Liverpool. However, he failed in an attempt to set up a private school, and instead became the prompter in a Dublin theatre. He went on to act in various strolling companies until 1778, when he produced the play &quot;The Crisis; or, Love and Famine&quot;, at Drury Lane. &quot;Duplicity&quot; followed in 1781.

==Literary and political career==
Two years later Holcroft went to Paris as correspondent of the &quot;Morning Herald&quot;. Here he attended the performances of Beaumarchais&#x27;s &quot;Mariage de Figaro&quot; until he had memorized the whole. His translation of it, with the title &quot;The Follies of the Day&quot;, was produced at Drury Lane in 1784. His comedy &quot;The Road to Ruin&quot;, his most successful play, was produced in 1792; a revival in 1873 ran for 118 nights.

His novels include &quot;Alwyn&quot; (1780), an account, largely autobiographical, of a strolling comedian, &quot;Anna St. Ives&quot; (the first British Jacobin novel, published in 1792), and &quot;The Adventures of Hugh Trevor&quot; (1794–1797). He also wrote &quot;Travels from Hamburg through Westphalia, Holland and the Netherlands to Paris&quot;, some volumes of verse, and translations from French and German. One of these was &quot;Letters Between Frederic II and M. De Voltaire&quot; (1789).

Sympathetic to the early ideals of the French Revolution, Holcroft assisted in publishing the first part of Thomas Paine&#x27;s &quot;The Rights of Man&quot; in 1791. He joined the Society for Constitutional Information (SCI) in 1792 and was appointed a member of a liaison committee to work with the LCS in early 1794. As a result of his activism, Holcroft was indicted in the autumn of 1794 for high treason and held in Newgate Prison whilst three other treason trials proceeded. In early December 1794 Holcroft was discharged without trial after those cases, against London Corresponding Society secretary Thomas Hardy, and SCI figure John Horne Tooke, resulted in acquittals.

As one of what Secretary of War William Windham called &quot;acquitted felons&quot;, Holcroft&#x27;s post-arrest reputation meant that his plays achieved little success after 1795, although he was instrumental in bringing melodrama to Britain at the end of the decade with his &quot;Deaf and Dumb&quot; (1801) and &quot;A Tale of Mystery&quot; (1802, an unacknowledged translation of de Pixerécourt&#x27;s &quot;Cœlina, ou, l&#x27;enfant du mystère&quot;). Despite a modicum of success with &quot;A Tale of Mystery&quot;, the remainder of the decade was marked by unsuccessful attempts to return to the public eye. He died in 1809, not long after a deathbed reconciliation with his closest friend from the 1790s (lately estranged), William Godwin. His &quot;Memoirs written by Himself and continued down to the Time of his Death, from his Diary, Notes and other Papers&quot;, by William Hazlitt, appeared in 1816, and was reprinted, in a slightly abridged form, in 1852.

==Personal life==

Thomas Holcroft married four times.

From his first wife, whom he married around 1765 and whose name is unknown, he had a daughter Ann (1766–1841), who in 1797 married Colonel William Tooke Harwood (1757–1824), a close associate of John Horne Tooke (1736–1812) and a fervent follower of Joanna Southcott (1750–1814).

In 1772 Holcroft married Matilda Tipler from Nottingham and had with her two children: a son William (1773–1789), who being only sixteen, committed suicide while attempting to escape to the West Indies after robbing his father of £40 (Memoirs, pp. 140–142), and a daughter Sophia (1775–1850), who in 1794 married William Cole, a merchant from Exeter. She resided later at Hamburg, and in 1805, after Cole&#x27;s death, was married to Georges Danton&#x27;s cousin Georges Nicholas Mergez (1772–1846), a general in the Napoleonic army.

In 1778, three years after the death of his second wife, Holcroft married Diana Robinson, who died in 1780 after giving birth to a daughter Fanny Margaretta (1780–1844). Fanny Holcroft was the author of the noted Romantic anti-slavery poem, &quot;The Negro&quot; (1797), as well as novels such as &quot;Fortitude and Frailty&quot; (1817) and &quot;The Wife and the Lover&quot; (1813–14). From 1805 to 1806, she also translated seven plays (from German, Italian, and Spanish) for her father&#x27;s &quot;Theatrical Recorder&quot; and later wrote a melodrama of her own.

After nine years as a widower, Holcroft married his fourth wife, Louisa Mercier (1779–1853), in March 1799. She was the daughter of a longstanding friend, Charles-André Mercier, brother of the French dramatist Louis-Sébastien Mercier (1740–1814). From this marriage came four sons and two daughters. The daughter Louisa (1801–1869) became the wife of Carlyle&#x27;s friend John Badams (Carlyle, Reminiscences, ed. C. E. Norton, 1887, i., pp. 93–95) in 1828; after Badam&#x27;s death (1833), she in 1835 married Barham Cole Mergez, her half-sister&#x27;s Sophia son from her second marriage who in 1846 inherited the title &quot;baron&quot; from his father. The son Thomas Holcroft Jr. (1803–1852) was a clerk in the House of Commons and spent several years in India, before becoming a journalist in 1822, who some time was Paris correspondent for the &quot;Morning Herald&quot; and secretary of the Asiatic Society. The widowed Louisa Mercier Holcroft remarried James Kenney (1780–1849), the dramatist, in 1812 and became the mother of three sons and three daughters.

<doc id="173970" wikidata="Q1033076" url="?curid=173970" title="Candlestick Park">
<text>Candlestick Park was an outdoor stadium on the West Coast of the United States, located in San Francisco&#x27;s Hunters Point area. The stadium was originally the home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Francisco Giants, who played there from 1960 until 1999, after which the Giants moved into Pacific Bell Park (since renamed Oracle Park) in 2000. It was also the home field of the San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League from 1971 through 2013. The 49ers moved to Levi&#x27;s Stadium in Santa Clara for the 2014 season. The last event held at Candlestick was a concert by Paul McCartney in August 2014, and the demolition of the stadium was completed in September 2015. As of 2019, the site is planned to be redeveloped into office space.

The stadium was situated at Candlestick Point on the western shore of San Francisco Bay. Candlestick Point was named for the &quot;candlestick birds&quot; (long-billed curlews) that populated the area for many years. Due to Candlestick Park&#x27;s location next to the bay, strong winds often swirled down into the stadium, creating unusual playing conditions. At the time of its construction in the late 1950s, the stadium site was one of the few pieces of land available in the city that was suitable for a sports stadium, and had room for the 10,000 parking spaces that had been promised to the Giants.

The surface of the field for most of its existence was natural bluegrass, but for nine seasons, from 1970 to 1978, the stadium had artificial turf. A &quot;sliding pit&quot; configuration, with dirt cut-outs only around the bases, was installed in 1971, primarily to keep the dust down in the breezy conditions. Following the 1978 football season, the playing surface was restored to natural grass.

==Park history==
When the New York Giants arrived in San Francisco in 1958, they played their home games at the old Seals Stadium at 16th and Bryant Streets. As part of the agreement regarding the Giants&#x27; relocation to the West Coast, the city of San Francisco promised to build a new stadium for the team. Most of the land at Candlestick Point was purchased from Charles Harney, a local contractor. Harney purchased the land in 1952 for a quarry and industrial development. He made a profit of over $2 million when he sold the land for the stadium. Harney received a no-bid contract to build the stadium. The entire deal was the subject of a grand jury investigation in 1958.

Ground was broken in for the stadium and the Giants selected the name of Candlestick Park, after a name-the-park contest on March 3, 1959 (for the derivation of which, see below). Prior to the choice of the name, its construction site had been shown on maps as the generic Bay View Stadium. It was the first modern baseball stadium, as it was the first to be built entirely of reinforced concrete. Then-Vice President Richard Nixon threw out the ceremonial first pitch on the opening day of Candlestick Park on April 12, 1960, and the Oakland Raiders played the final three games of the 1960 season and their entire 1961 American Football League season at Candlestick Park. With only 77 home runs hit in 1960 (46 by Giants, 31 by visitors), the fences were moved in, from left-center to right-center, for the 1961 season.

Following the 1970 season, the first with AstroTurf, Candlestick Park was enclosed, with grandstands around the outfield. This was in preparation for the 49ers in 1971, who were moving from their long-time home of Kezar Stadium. The result was that the wind speed dropped marginally, but often swirled irregularly throughout the stadium, and the view of San Francisco Bay was lost.

Candlestick Park played host to two Major League Baseball All-Star Games in its life as home for the Giants. The stadium hosted the first of two games in 1961 and later hosted the 1984 All-Star Game. The Giants played a total of six postseason series at Candlestick Park; they played host to the NLCS in 1971, 1987, and 1989, the World Series in 1962 and 1989, and one NLDS in 1997.

The 49ers hosted eight NFC Championship games during their time at Candlestick Park. The first was in January 1982 when Dwight Clark caught a game-winning touchdown pass from Joe Montana to lead the 49ers to Super Bowl XVI by defeating the Dallas Cowboys. Clark&#x27;s play went down as one of the more famous in football history, and was dubbed &quot;The Catch&quot;. The last of these came in January 2012, when Lawrence Tynes kicked a field goal in overtime to defeat the 49ers and send the New York Giants to Super Bowl XLVI. The final postseason game hosted by the 49ers at Candlestick Park was the 2012 NFC Divisional Playoff matchup between the 49ers and the Green Bay Packers, won by the 49ers by a score of 45–31. The 49ers&#x27; record in NFC Championship games at Candlestick Park was 4-4; they defeated the Cowboys twice, in 1981 and 1994, the Chicago Bears in 1984, and the Los Angeles Rams in 1989. Their losses came against the Cowboys in 1992, the Giants in 1990 and 2011, and the Packers in 1997.

In addition to Clark&#x27;s famous touchdown catch, two more plays referred to as &quot;The Catch&quot; took place during games at Candlestick Park. The play dubbed &quot;The Catch II&quot; came in the 1998 NFC Wild Card round, as Steve Young found Terrell Owens for a touchdown with eight seconds left to defeat the two-time defending NFC Champion Packers. The play called &quot;The Catch III&quot; came in the 2011 NFC Divisional Playoffs, when Alex Smith threw a touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with nine seconds remaining to provide the winning margin against the New Orleans Saints.

On October 17, 1989, the Loma Prieta earthquake (magnitude 6.9) struck San Francisco, minutes before Game 3 of the World Series was to begin at Candlestick Park. No one within the stadium was injured, although minor structural damage was incurred to the stadium. Al Michaels and Tim McCarver, who called the game for ABC, later credited the stadium&#x27;s design for saving thousands of lives. An ESPN documentary about the earthquake revealed that the local stadium authority demanded that Candlestick Park undertake a major engineering project to shore up perceived safety red flags in the stadium. The authority pushed reluctant officials to get this done between the 1988 and 1989 baseball seasons, which prevented a &quot;collapse wave&quot; that could have killed thousands of fans and led to there being very few casualties of any kind in Candlestick Park after such a massive natural disaster. The World Series between the Giants and their Bay rivals the Oakland Athletics was subsequently delayed for 10 days, in part to give engineers time to check the stadium&#x27;s overall structural soundness (and that of the Athletics&#x27; nearby home, the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum). During this time, the 49ers moved their game against the New England Patriots on October 22 to Stanford Stadium, where they had defeated the Miami Dolphins 38–16 to win Super Bowl XIX on January 20, 1985.

The NFL awarded Super Bowl XXXIII to Candlestick Park on November 2, 1994. After planned renovations in preparation for the game were not made, the NFL owners instead awarded Super Bowl XXXIII to the Miami area during their meeting on October 31, 1996. The league promised to award Super Bowl XXXVII following construction of a new football stadium, which was approved by voters in 1997, but the forced sale of the team by owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. caused plans to fall through.

In , the Giants moved to the new Pacific Bell Park (now called Oracle Park) in the China Basin neighborhood, leaving the 49ers as the sole professional sports team to use Candlestick Park. The final baseball game was played on September 30, 1999, against their long-time rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, who won 9–4. In that game, all nine Dodgers starters had at least one base hit, while the stadium&#x27;s final home run came from Dodgers&#x27; right fielder Raúl Mondesí in the 6th inning. The National League rivalry between the Giants and Dodgers, one of the oldest and most hotly contested in the Major Leagues, dated back to when both teams were based in New York City. When first the Dodgers, then the Giants, moved to California in 1958, the rivalry continued unabated.

For its last several years as home to just the 49ers, Candlestick Park was the only remaining NFL stadium to have begun as a baseball-only facility which later underwent an extensive redesign to accommodate football. That was evidenced by the stadium&#x27;s curiously oblong and irregular shape, whereby views from a sizable section of lower-deck seating in the baseball configuration&#x27;s right-field corner were so badly obstructed by the eastern grandstand of the football seating configuration that they were unusable for football games and would consequently sit empty. Since a football gridiron, including its end zones and benches along the sidelines, is much smaller than a baseball playing field and foul territory, this large grandstand, which provided thousands of prime seats along one whole sideline of the football field, was designed to be retractable. It would slide backwards for baseball games, under the upper deck, and provide a smaller section of baseball seating beyond the outfield wall in right. After the Giants played their 1999 season and moved away from Candlestick, this grandstand was left permanently in its football position, and the unusable seats were eventually removed.

On September 3, 2011, Candlestick Park hosted the first and only college football game in its history with a neutral site game between the California Golden Bears and Fresno State Bulldogs (Cal was designated the &quot;home&quot; team). This game was in San Francisco, because of the massive renovation and seismic retrofit at California&#x27;s home stadium, California Memorial Stadium. The rest of the Golden Bears&#x27; home games in 2011 were played at AT&amp;T Park. Cal won the game 36–21.

At approximately 5:19 p.m. local time on December 19, 2011, Candlestick Park experienced an unexpected power outage just before a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; game between the 49ers and the Pittsburgh Steelers. An aerial shot shown live on ESPN showed a transformer sparking and then the stadium going completely dark. About 17 minutes later, however, the park&#x27;s lights came back on in time for the game&#x27;s kickoff. With 12:13 remaining in the second quarter, another power outage created yet another 30-minute delay before play resumed again. The 49ers 2011 season ended at Candlestick Park with a loss to the New York Giants in the NFC Championship Game.

The 49ers played their final game at Candlestick Park on Monday, December 23, 2013, against the Atlanta Falcons, winning 34–24 after a NaVorro Bowman interception that would be called The Pick at the Stick by some sports columnists. This game was the facility&#x27;s 36th and final game on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, the most at any stadium used by the NFL.

==Reputation==
As a baseball field, the stadium was infamous for the windy conditions, damp air and dew from fog, and chilly temperatures. The wind often made it difficult for outfielders trying to catch fly balls, as well as for fans, while the damp grass further complicated play for outfielders who had to play in cold, wet shoes. Architect John Bolles designed the park with a boomerang-shaped concrete baffle in the upper tier in order to protect the park from wind. Unfortunately, it never worked properly. For Candlestick&#x27;s first 10 seasons, the wind blew in from left-center and out toward right-center. When the park was expanded to accommodate the 49ers in 1971, it was thought that fully enclosing the park would cut down on the wind significantly. Instead, the wind swirled from all directions, and was as strong and cold as before. Giants Hall of Fame center fielder Willie Mays claimed the wind cost him over 100 home runs. (It may be noted that in the 12 years he played at Candlestick Park, from 1960 through 1971, Mays hit 396 home runs, 203 at Candlestick and 193 on the road.) Nonetheless, he had less difficulty fielding balls in the windy conditions. Mays was used to playing in difficult and absurdly sized field conditions, beginning his career at the Polo Grounds in New York, which featured an enormous outfield where he made a famous World Series-saving catch.

During the first All Star Game of (one of two played in the park—the other was in ), Giants pitcher Stu Miller was blown off balance by a gust of wind and was charged with a balk. Two years later, wind picked up the entire batting cage and dropped it 60 feet (18 m) away on the pitcher&#x27;s mound while the New York Mets were taking batting practice.

The stadium also had the reputation as the coldest park in Major League Baseball, with winds blowing directly off the Pacific Ocean. It was initially built with a radiant heating system of hot water pipes under the lower box seats in a space between the concrete and the ground. The pipes were not embedded in the concrete, however, and did not produce enough heat to offset the cold air. Both the city and the Giants balked at the cost of upgrading the system so it would work properly, which would have involved removing the seats and concrete, embedding larger pipes, and replacing the concrete and seats. As a result, the Giants played more day games than any Major League Baseball team except the Chicago Cubs, whose ballpark, Wrigley Field, did not have lights installed until 1988. Many locals, including Giants&#x27; broadcaster Lon Simmons, were surprised at the decision to build the park right on the bay, in one of the coldest areas of the city. Attorney Melvin Belli filed a claim against the Giants in 1960 because his six-seat box, which cost him almost $1,600, was unbearably cold. Belli won in court, claiming that the &quot;radiant heating system&quot; advertised was a failure.

The Giants eventually played on the reputation to bolster fan support with humorous promotions such as awarding the &#x27;Croix de Candlestick&#x27; pin to fans who stayed for the duration of extra-inning night games. The pins featured the Giants&#x27; &quot;SF&quot; monogram capped with snow, along with the Latin slogan &quot;Veni, vidi, vixi&quot; (&quot;I came, I saw, I survived&quot;). Among many less-than-flattering fan nicknames for the park were &quot;North Pole&quot;, &quot;Cave of the Winds&quot;, &quot;Windlestick&quot;, &quot;The Quagmire&quot;, and &quot;The Ashtray By The Bay&quot;. Older fans called it &quot;The Dump&quot; in honor of the former use of the land. Ironically, the Giants played their last night game at Candlestick (against the Los Angeles Dodgers) on September 29, 1999, under clear skies and a game time temperature of 74° as well as their last day game at Candlestick on September 30, 1999, under blue skies with no fog and a game time temperature of 82°, all of which was common for September games.

Giants owner Horace Stoneham visited the site as early as 1957 and was involved in the stadium&#x27;s design from the outset. While he was aware of the weather conditions, he usually visited the park during the day, not knowing about the particularly cold, windy and foggy conditions that overtook it at night. Originally, Bolles&#x27; concrete baffle would have extended all the way to left field, which would have further reduced the prevailing winds. Nevertheless, the size of the structure was reduced for cost savings. In 1962, Stoneham commissioned a study of the wind conditions. The study revealed that had the windy conditions been known prior to construction, conditions would have been significantly improved by building the park 100 yards farther to the north and east. This would have meant building it on fill, however, which is less stable during earthquakes. The stadium&#x27;s location on the bedrock of Bayview Hill provided more stability.

The winds were intense in the immediate area of the park. Studies showed they were no more frequent than other parts of San Francisco but are subject to higher gusts. This is because of a hill immediately adjacent to the park. This hill, in turn, is the first topographical obstacle met by the prevailing winds arriving from the Pacific Ocean to the west. Arriving at Candlestick from the Pacific, these winds travel through what is known as the Alemany Gap before reaching the hill. The combination of ocean winds free-flowing to Candlestick, then swirling over the adjacent hill, created the cold and windy conditions that were the bane of the Giants&#x27; 40-year stay on Candlestick Point. It was indeed the wind and not the ambient air temperature that provided Candlestick&#x27;s famed chill. The Giants&#x27; subsequent home, Oracle Park, is just one degree warmer, but is far less windy, creating a &quot;warmer&quot; (relatively speaking) effect. While the wind is a summer condition (hot inland, cool oceanside), winter weather is right in line with the rest of sea level Northern California (mild with occasional rain).

===Other design flaws and irregularities===
Candlestick was an object of scorn from baseball purists for reasons other than weather. Although originally built for baseball, foul territory was quite roomy. According to Simmons, nearly every seat was too far from the field even before the 1971 expansion. As with the radiant heating system in the grandstands, the heating systems in the dugouts were wholly inadequate. Players on other National League teams – especially if they had played for the Giants beforehand – complained that the visitors dugout was noticeably colder than the Giants&#x27; dugout. That was due to two factors. One was that the Giants&#x27; dugout included a tunnel to the clubhouse, so heat from the clubhouse flowed into the dugout. The other involved the placement of the dugouts. The Giants&#x27; dugout was located on the first base side, which was on the south side of the stadium. The visitors&#x27; dugout was located on the third base (west) side of the field.

==Notable events==

===Concerts===
===The Beatles&#x27; final concert===
The Beatles famously gave their last full public concert at Candlestick Park on August 29, 1966. Songs performed at the show were &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot;, &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot;, &quot;Day Tripper&quot;, &quot;Baby&#x27;s in Black&quot;, &quot;I Feel Fine&quot;, &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;, &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;, &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, and &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;.

An &quot;official&quot; bootleg recording of the 33-minute setlist was made by the Beatles&#x27; press officer, Tony Barrow, at the request of the band. As his cassette could only record 30 minutes per side, it ran out with a minute of the closing song, &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, remaining. This recording has never been officially released, although it has been leaked on to the internet.

At the time, The Beatles had not announced that this was to be their final concert, and even if the foursome themselves knew, it was a closely guarded secret. Much of the existing color film footage of the concert was captured by a 15-year-old Beatles fan, Barry Hood. A relatively small amount of black-and-white footage was shot by local TV news in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento. Hood released some of his film in a limited edition documentary titled &quot;The Beatles Live In San Francisco&quot;, but more of Hood&#x27;s very rare footage remains in a vault, unseen by the public as of 2017. On August 14, 2014, former Beatle Paul McCartney returned to become the closing act of Candlestick Park&#x27;s long musical history. To showcase the event, McCartney contacted Barry Hood and used a portion of his original 1966 Beatles film on a big screen at this last concert.

===Papal Mass===
Pope John Paul II celebrated a Papal Mass on September 18, 1987, at Candlestick Park during his tour of America. An estimated crowd of 70,000 attended the Mass.

===In popular culture===
Candlestick Park was home to dozens of commercial shoots as well as the location for the climactic scene in both the 1962 thriller &quot;Experiment in Terror&quot; and the 1974 Richard Rush comedy &quot;Freebie and the Bean&quot;. The stadium was featured in the 1976 &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie, &quot;The Enforcer&quot;. The stadium was featured in the 1994 family comedy &quot;Getting Even with Dad&quot;, where the father character (played by Ted Danson) takes his son (played by Macaulay Culkin) to a San Francisco Giants game. The stadium was featured briefly in the 1996 action film &quot;The Rock&quot; where a missile almost attacks the place before being diverted away by the last second. In February 2011, scenes for the film &quot;Contagion&quot;, starring Matt Damon, Kate Winslet and Jude Law, were filmed at the stadium. &quot;The Fan&quot; was also filmed there in 1996. In 2010, Candlestick Park was featured as the finishing point for the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race 16&quot;. And 1989 World Series, The series was known for one of the sites of the 1989 San Francisco earthquake.

==Name changes==
Some think that Candlestick Point was named for the indigenous &quot;candlestick bird&quot; (long-billed curlew), once common to the point. The book &quot;California Geographic Names&quot; lists Candlestick Point as being named for a pinnacle of rock first noted in 1781 by the De Anza Expedition. This pinnacle was also noted by the U.S. Geodetic Survey in 1869. The pinnacle disappeared around 1920.

The rights to the stadium name were licensed to 3Com Corporation from September 1995 until 2002, for $900,000 a year. During that time, the park became known as &quot;3Com Park at Candlestick Point&quot;, or, simply, &quot;3Com Park&quot;. In 2002, the naming rights deal expired, and the park then became officially known as &quot;San Francisco Stadium at Candlestick Point&quot;. On September 28, 2004, a new naming rights deal was signed with Monster Cable, a maker of cables for electronic equipment, and the stadium was renamed &quot;Monster Park&quot;. Just over a month later, however, a measure passed in the November 2 election stipulated that the stadium name revert to &quot;Candlestick&quot; permanently after the contract with Monster expired in 2008.

The City and County of San Francisco had trouble finding a new naming sponsor due in part to the downturn in the economy, but also because the stadium&#x27;s tenure as 3Com Park was tenuous at best. Many local fans were annoyed with the change and continued referring to the park by its original name, regardless of the official name. The Giants reportedly continued to call the stadium &quot;Candlestick Park&quot; in media guides, because the naming rights were initiated by the 49ers. Some even mocked the 3Com sponsorship. Chris Berman, for instance, usually called it &quot;Commercial-Stick Park&quot;. Local fans sometimes called it &quot;Dot-com Park&quot; (see Dot-com bubble). Freeway signs in the vicinity were changed to read &quot;Monster Park&quot; as part of an overall signage upgrade to national standards on California highways, but in 2008 those signs were changed back to &quot;Candlestick Park&quot;.

The name change also ended up being confusing for the intended branding purposes, as without the &quot;Cable&quot; qualifier in the official name, many erroneously thought the stadium was named for the Monster.com employment website or Monster Energy Drink, not the cable vendor.

On August 10, 2007, San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom announced that the playing field would be renamed &quot;Bill Walsh Field&quot; in honor of the former Stanford and 49ers coach, who died on July 30 that year, pending the approval of the city government. The stadium itself retained its name as was contractually obligated. Commentators still use this name occasionally, most recently when Jerry Rice&#x27;s jersey was retired.

On September 18, 2009, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;″s Peter King used the mock-combination name &quot;Candle3Monsterstick&quot; in reference to the many name changes the stadium has gone through.

Despite numerous official and unofficial name changes over the history of the stadium and surrounding park/facilities, the stadium was lovingly referred to as &quot;the Stick&quot; by many locals and die-hard fans from its original titling of &quot;Candlestick Park&quot; in 1960.

==Replacement and demolition==
By 1997, plans were underway to construct a new 68,000-seat stadium at Candlestick Point. On November 8, 2006, however, the 49ers announced that they would abandon their search for a location in San Francisco and begin to pursue the idea of building a stadium in Santa Clara. Because its centerpiece stadium was lost, San Francisco withdrew its bid for the 2016 Olympics on November 13, 2006. Ground-breaking for the Santa Clara stadium occurred on April 19, 2012. On May 8, 2013, the media announced that the name of the new stadium would be Levi&#x27;s Stadium. The stadium opened on July 17, 2014, in time for the 2014 NFL season. The 49ers christened their new home a month after it opened.

A grassroots movement for the Giants to play another baseball game at Candlestick had existed since 2009. Many fans had hoped to see another game in 2010, the 50th anniversary of the Giants&#x27; first season at Candlestick Park, but the idea was dropped due to the cost. Although many fans wished for another Giants game at the &quot;Stick&quot;, the Giants never returned to their former stadium for a final game.

With the departure of the 49ers, Candlestick Park was left without any permanent tenants. Demolition was expected to occur soon after the 49ers played their final game of the 2013 season, but over time the date of demolition was moved back to late 2014, with several special events planned for the intervening period. In April 2014, Paul McCartney announced that he would perform a concert as the last scheduled event in the 54-year-old stadium on August 14, 2014. The Beatles had performed their last scheduled concert at Candlestick Park 48 years earlier.
Demolition began in November 2014 as workers tore out seats. In January 2015, the developer withdrew a request to implode the stadium, possibly to be broadcast as part of the Super Bowl halftime entertainment. Instead, mechanized structural demolition commenced, which was favored over implosion due to local dust pollution concerns. Demolition was expected to be complete by March 2015, but was not completed until September 24, 2015.

In 2014, 1,000 historic Candlestick Park Stadium seats were installed at Kezar Stadium for the public to enjoy. The renovation was funded by the city&#x27;s Capital Planning General Fund. Mayor Edwin M. Lee helped re-open the stadium with a warm-up run.

In December 2016, 4,000 additional historic Candlestick seats were acquired and installed at Kezar. The seats were paid for by the San Francisco Deltas as a part of a $1-million improvement the team agreed upon to make use of the stadium.
In November 2014, Lennar and Macerich announced plans to build a dense &quot;urban outlet&quot; center incorporating retail and housing with underground parking on the Candlestick Park site. The proponents suggested that the new development would be completed in 2017. The project has not proceeded, and the plan was suspended by its proponents in April 2018.

==Croix de Candlestick==
The Croix de Candlestick is an award pin that was given out to baseball fans as they exited Candlestick Park at the conclusion of a night game that went extra innings. In reference to the ballpark&#x27;s legendarily cold winds, the pin carried the motto, &quot;Veni, Vidi, Vixi&quot; (&quot;I came, I saw, I survived&quot;).

In order to receive a pin, the fans would have to redeem their ticket stub for the pin at Patrick &amp; Co. Stationery store in San Francisco. The pin, developed by team marketing director Patrick J. Gallagher, was first issued in 1983. In 1983 the San Francisco Giants played in five extra inning night games, with a total attendance of 70,933 and in 1984 they played in five extra inning night games with a total attendance of 44,031. The pin was given out for several years. On September 28–30, 1999, tens of thousands of fans received the pin for attending the Giants&#x27; final three-game home stand at Candlestick, against the team&#x27;s archrival, the Los Angeles Dodgers. A &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist later called it &quot;the smartest marketing promotional in Bay Area history&quot;.

<text>Essen () is the central and, after Dortmund, second-largest city of the Ruhr, the largest urban area in Germany. Its population of makes it the fourth-largest city of North Rhine-Westphalia after Cologne, Düsseldorf and Dortmund, as well as the tenth-largest city of Germany. Essen lies in the larger Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, second largest by GDP in the EU, and is part of the cultural area of Rhineland. Because of its central location in the Ruhr, Essen is often regarded as the Ruhr&#x27;s &quot;secret capital&quot;. Two rivers flow through the city: the Emscher in the north, and in the south the Ruhr River, which is dammed in Essen to form the and reservoirs. The central and northern boroughs of Essen historically belong to the Low German Westphalian dialects area, and the south of the city to the Low Franconian Bergish area.

Essen is seat to several of the region&#x27;s authorities, as well as to eight of the 100 largest publicly held German corporations by revenue, including three DAX-listed corporations. Essen is often considered the energy capital of Germany with E.ON and RWE, Germany&#x27;s largest energy providers, both headquartered in the city. Essen is also known for its impact on the arts through the respected Folkwang University of the Arts, its School of Management and Design, and the Red Dot industrial product design award. In early 2003, the universities of Essen and the nearby city of Duisburg (both established in 1972) were merged into the University of Duisburg-Essen with campuses in both cities and a university hospital in Essen. In 1958, Essen was chosen as the seat to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen, often referred to as the diocese of the Ruhr ().

Founded around 845, Essen remained a small town within the sphere of influence of an important ecclesiastical principality, Essen Abbey, until the onset of industrialization. The city then—especially through the Krupp family&#x27;s iron works—became one of Germany&#x27;s most important coal and steel centres. Essen, until the 1970s, attracted workers from all over the country; it was the fifth-largest city in Germany between 1929 and 1988, peaking at over 730,000 inhabitants in 1962. Following the region-wide decline of heavy industries in the last decades of the 20th century, the city has seen the development of a strong tertiary sector of the economy. The most notable witness of this structural change () is the Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex, which had once been the largest of its kind in Europe. Ultimately closed in 1993, both the coking plant and the mine have been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site since 2001.

Notable accomplishments of the city in recent years include the title of European Capital of Culture on behalf of the whole Ruhr area in 2010 and the selection as the European Green Capital for 2017.

== Geography ==

=== General ===
Essen is located in the centre of the Ruhr area, one of the largest urban areas in Europe comprising eleven independent cities and four districts with some 5.3 million inhabitants into a megalopolis. The city limits of Essen itself are long, and border ten citiesfive belonging to a district () and five independentwith a total population of approximately 1.4 million. The city extends over from north to south and from west to east, mainly north of the River Ruhr.

The Ruhr forms the reservoir in the boroughs of Fischlaken, Kupferdreh, Heisingen and Werden. The lake, a popular recreational area, dates from 1931 to 1933, when some thousands of unemployed coal miners dredged it with primitive tools. Generally, large areas south of the River Ruhr (including the suburbs of Schuir and Kettwig) are quite green and are often quoted as examples of rural structures in the otherwise relatively densely populated central Ruhr area. According to the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, Essen with 9.2% of its area covered by recreational green is the greenest city in North Rhine-Westphalia and the third-greenest city in Germany. The city has been shortlisted for the title of European Green Capital two consecutive times, for 2016 and 2017, winning for 2017. The city was singled out for its exemplary practices in protecting and enhancing nature and biodiversity and efforts to reduce water consumption. Essen participates in a variety of networks and initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve the city&#x27;s resilience in the face of climate change.

The lowest point can be found in the northern borough of Karnap at , the highest point in the borough of Heidhausen at . The average elevation is .

=== City districts ===
Essen comprises fifty boroughs which in turn are grouped into nine suburban districts (called &quot;Stadtbezirke&quot;) often named after the most important boroughs. Each Stadtbezirk is assigned a Roman numeral and has a local body of nineteen members with limited authority. Most of the boroughs were originally independent municipalities but were gradually annexed from 1901 to 1975. This long-lasting process of annexation has led to a strong identification of the population with &quot;their&quot; boroughs or districts and to a rare peculiarity: the borough of Kettwig, located south of the Ruhr River, and which was not annexed until 1975, has its own area code and remains part of the Archdiocese of Cologne, whereas all other boroughs of Essen and some neighbouring cities constitute the Diocese of Essen.

=== Climate ===
Essen has a typical oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;; Trewartha: &quot;Dobk&quot;) with cool winters and warm summers (different from Berlin or Stuttgart). Without large mountains and the presence of inland seas, it ends up extending a predominantly marine climate is found in Essen, usually a little more extreme and drier in other continents in such geographical location. Its average annual temperature is : during the day and at night. The average annual precipitation is . The coldest month of the year is January, when the average temperature is . The warmest months are July and August, with an average temperature of .

* Highest Temperature on 25 July 2019.
* Warmest Minimum on 1 August 1943.
* Coldest Maximum on 1 February 1956.
* Lowest Temperature on 27 January 1942.
* Highest Daily Precipitation on 14 August 1954.
* Wettest Month in August 1938.

* Latest Snowfall: 28 April 1985.
* Longest annual sunshine: 2,058.8 hours in 2022.
* Shortest annual sunshine: 1,192.5 hours in 1962.


== History ==

=== Origin of the name ===
In German-speaking countries, the name of the city Essen often causes confusion as to its origins, because it has the same form as the German infinitive of the verb for &quot;eating&quot; (written as lowercase &quot;&quot;), and/or the German noun for food (which is always capitalized as &quot;&quot;, adding to the confusion). Although scholars still dispute the interpretation of the name, there remain a few noteworthy interpretations. The oldest known form of the city&#x27;s name is &quot;Astnide&quot;, which changed to Essen by way of forms such as Astnidum, Assinde, Essendia and Esnede. The name Astnide may have referred either to a region where many ash trees were found or to a region in the east (of the Frankish Empire).

=== Early history ===
The oldest archaeological find, the &quot;Vogelheimer Klinge&quot;, dates back to . It is a blade found in the borough of in the northern part of the city during the construction of the Rhine–Herne Canal in 1926. Other artifacts from the Stone Age have also been found, although these are not overly numerous. Land utilization was very high—especially due to mining activities during the Industrial Age—and any more major finds, especially from the Mesolithic era, are not expected. Finds from and onwards are far more common, the most important one being a Megalithic tomb found in 1937. Simply called &quot;Chest of Stone&quot; (), it is referred to as &quot;Essen&#x27;s earliest preserved example of architecture&quot;.

Essen was part of the settlement areas of several Germanic peoples (Chatti, Bructeri, Marsi), although a clear distinction among these groupings is difficult.

The castle in the south of Essen dates back to the eighth century, the nearby to the ninth century.

Recent research into Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; has identified the &quot;polis&quot; or &quot;oppidum&quot; Navalia as Essen.

=== Eighth–twelfth centuries ===

Around 845, Saint Altfrid (around 800–874), the later Bishop of Hildesheim, founded an abbey for women () in the centre of present-day Essen. The first abbess was Altfrid&#x27;s relative Gerswit (see also: Essen Abbey). In 799, Saint Liudger had already founded Benedictine Werden Abbey on its own grounds a few kilometres south. The region was sparsely populated with only a few smallholdings and an old and probably abandoned castle. Whereas Werden Abbey sought to support Liudger&#x27;s missionary work in the Harz region (Helmstedt/Halberstadt), Essen Abbey was meant to care for women of the higher Saxon nobility. This abbey was not an abbey in the ordinary sense, but rather intended as a residence and educational institution for the daughters and widows of the higher nobility; led by an abbess, the members other than the abbess herself were not obliged to take vows of chastity.

Around 852, construction of the collegiate church of the abbey began, to be completed in 870. A major fire in 946 heavily damaged both the church and the settlement. The church was rebuilt, expanded considerably, and is the foundation of the present Essen Cathedral.

The first documented mention of Essen dates back to 898, when Zwentibold, King of Lotharingia, willed territory on the western bank of the River Rhine to the abbey. Another document, describing the foundation of the abbey and allegedly dating back to 870, is now considered an 11th-century forgery.

In 971, Mathilde II, granddaughter of Emperor Otto I, took charge of the abbey. She was to become the most important of all abbesses in the history of Essen. She reigned for over 40 years, and endowed the abbey&#x27;s treasury with invaluable objects such as the oldest preserved seven branched candelabrum, and the Golden Madonna of Essen, the oldest known sculpture of the Virgin Mary in the western world. Mathilde was succeeded by other women related to the Ottonian emperors: Sophia, daughter of Otto II and sister of Otto III, and Teophanu, granddaughter of Otto II. It was under the reign of Teophanu that Essen, which had been called a city since 1003, received the right to hold markets in 1041. Ten years later, Teophanu had the eastern part of Essen Abbey constructed. Its crypt contains the tombs of St. Altfrid, Mathilde II, and Teophanu herself.

=== 13th–17th centuries ===

In 1216, the abbey, which had only been an important landowner until then, gained the status of a princely residence when Emperor Frederick II called abbess Elisabeth I &quot;Princess of the Empire&quot; () in an official letter. In 1244, 28 years later, Essen received its town charter and seal when Konrad von Hochstaden, the Archbishop of Cologne, marched into the city and erected a city wall together with the population. This proved a temporary emancipation of the population of the city from the princess-abbesses, but this lasted only until 1290. That year, King Rudolph I restored the princess-abbesses to full sovereignty over the city, much to the dismay of the population of the growing city, who called for self-administration and imperial immediacy. The title free imperial city was finally granted by Emperor Charles IV in 1377. However, in 1372, Charles had paradoxically endorsed Rudolph I&#x27;s 1290 decision and hence left both the abbey and the city in imperial favour. Disputes between the city and the abbey about supremacy over the region remained common until the abbey&#x27;s dissolution in 1803. Many lawsuits were filed at the Reichskammergericht, one of them lasting almost 200 years. The final decision of the court in 1670 was that the city had to be &quot;duly obedient in dos and don&#x27;ts&quot; to the abbesses but could maintain its old rights—a decision that did not really solve any of the problems.

In 1563, the city council, with its self-conception as the only legitimate ruler of Essen, introduced the Protestant Reformation. The Catholic abbey had no troops to counter this development.

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War ===
During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Protestant city and the Catholic abbey opposed each other. In 1623, princess-abbess Maria Clara von Spaur, Pflaum und Valör, managed to direct Catholic Spaniards against the city in order to initiate a Counter-Reformation. In 1624, a &quot;re-Catholicization&quot; law was enacted, and churchgoing was strictly controlled. In 1628, the city council filed against this at the Reichskammergericht. Maria had to flee to Cologne when the Dutch stormed the city in 1629. She returned in the summer of 1631 following the Bavarians under Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim, only to leave again in September. She died 1644 in Cologne.

The war proved a severe blow to the city, with frequent arrests, kidnapping and rape. Even after the Peace of Westphalia from 1648, troops remained in the city until 9 September 1650.

=== Industrialisation ===

The first historic evidence of the important mining tradition of Essen date back to the 14th century, when the princess-abbess was granted mining rights. The first silver mine opened in 1354, but the indisputably more important coal was not mentioned until 1371, and coal mining only began in 1450.

At the end of the 16th century, many coal mines had opened in Essen, and the city earned a name as a centre of the weapons industry. Around 1570, gunsmiths made high profits and in 1620, they produced 14,000 rifles and pistols a year. The city became increasingly important strategically.

Resident in Essen since the 16th century, the Krupp family dynasty and Essen shaped each other. In 1811, Friedrich Krupp founded Germany&#x27;s first cast-steel factory in Essen and laid the cornerstone for what was to be the largest enterprise in Europe for a couple of decades. The weapon factories in Essen became so important that a sign facing the main railway station welcomed visitors Hitler and Mussolini to the &quot;Armory of the Reich&quot; () in 1937. The Krupp Works also were the main reason for the large population growth beginning in the mid-19th century. Essen reached a population of 100,000 in 1896. Other industrialists, such as Friedrich Grillo, who in 1892 donated the Grillo-Theater to the city, also played a major role in the shaping of the city and the Ruhr area in the late 19th and early 20th century.

=== World War I and occupation ===

Riots broke out in February 1917 following a breakdown in the supply of flour. There were then strikes in the Krupp factory.

On 11 January 1923 the Occupation of the Ruhr was carried out by the invasion of French and Belgian troops into the Ruhr. The French Prime Minister, Raymond Poincaré, was convinced that Germany failed to comply the demands of the Treaty of Versailles. On the morning of 31 March 1923, the culmination of this French-German confrontation occurred when a small French military command, occupied the Krupp car hall to seize several vehicles. This event caused 13 deaths and 28 injured. The occupation of the Ruhr ended in summer 1925.

=== Nazism, World War II ===
On the night of Kristallnacht on 10 November 1938, the synagogue was sacked, but remained through the whole war in the exterior almost intact. The Steele synagogue was completely destroyed.

During the Nazi era, tens of thousands of slave labourers were forced to work in 350 Essen forced labour camps. Here, they did mining work and worked for companies like Krupp and Siemens. Alfried Krupp was convicted in the Krupp trial at Nuremberg for his role in this but was pardoned by the US in 1951. There were several subcamps in Essen in the Second World War, such as the subcamps , , .
As a major industrial centre, Essen was a target for allied bombing, the Royal Air Force (RAF) dropping a total of of bombs on the city. Over 270 air raids were launched against the city, destroying 90% of the centre and 60% of the suburbs. On 5 March 1943 Essen was subjected to one of the heaviest air-raids of the war. 461 people were killed, 1,593 injured and a further 50,000 residents of Essen were made homeless. On 13 December 1944 three British airmen were lynched.

The Krupp decoy site () was built in Velbert to divert Allied airstrikes from the actual production site of the arms factory in Essen.
The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Essen in April 1945. The US 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 17th Airborne Division, acting as regular infantry and not in a parachute role, entered the city unopposed and captured it on 10 April 1945.

After the occupation of Germany by the allies, Essen was assigned to the British Zone of Occupation. On 8 March 1946, a German army officer and a civilian were hanged for the lynching of three British airmen in December 1944.

=== Twenty-first century ===

Although weaponry is no longer produced in Essen, old industrial enterprises such as ThyssenKrupp and RWE remain large employers in the city. Foundations such as the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach-Stiftung still promote the well-being of the city, for example by supporting a hospital and donating for a new building for the Museum Folkwang, one of the Ruhr area&#x27;s major art museums.

== Politics ==
=== Historical development ===
The administration of Essen had for a long time been in the hands of the princess-abbesses as heads of the Imperial Abbey of Essen. However, from the 14th century onwards, the city council increasingly grew in importance. In 1335, it started choosing two burgomasters, one of whom was placed in charge of the treasury. In 1377, Essen was granted imperial immediacy but had to abandon this privilege later on. Between the early 15th and 20th centuries, the political system of Essen underwent several changes, most importantly the introduction of the Protestant Reformation in 1563, the annexation of 1802 by Prussia, and the subsequent secularization of the principality in 1803. The territory was made part of the Prussian Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg from 1815 to 1822, after which it became part of the Prussian Rhine Province until its dissolution in 1946.

During the German Revolution of 1918–19, Essen was the home of the Essen Tendency () within the Communist Workers&#x27; Party of Germany. In 1922 they founded the Communist Workers&#x27; International. Essen became one of the centres of resistance to Social Democracy and the Freikorps alike.

During the Nazi era (1933–1945), mayors were installed by the Nazi Party. After World War II, the military government of the British occupation zone installed a new mayor and a municipal constitution modelled on that of British cities. Later, the city council was again elected by the population. The mayor was elected by the council as its head and as the city&#x27;s main representative. The administration was led by a full-time . In 1999, the position of was abolished in North Rhine-Westphalia and the mayor became both main representative and administrative head. In addition, the population now elects the mayor directly.

=== Mayor ===
The current mayor of Essen is Thomas Kufen of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), who was elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2020.

The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

=== Coat of arms ===
The coat of arms of the city of Essen is a heraldic peculiarity. Granted in 1886, it is a so-called arms of alliance () and consists of two separate shields under a single crown. Most other coats of arms of cities use a mural crown instead of a heraldic crown. The crown, however, does not refer to the city of Essen itself, but instead to the secularized ecclesiastical principality of Essen under the reign of the princess-abbesses. The dexter (heraldically right) escutcheon shows the double-headed Imperial Eagle of the Holy Roman Empire, granted to the city in 1623. The sinister (heraldically left) escutcheon is one of the oldest emblems of Essen and shows a sword that people believed was used to behead the city&#x27;s patron Saints Cosmas and Damian. People tend to connect the sword in the left shield with one found in the cathedral treasury. This sword, however, is much more recent. A slightly modified and more heraldically correct version of the coat of arms can be found on the roof of the hotel near the main station.

==Demographics==
Essen has a population of and is the 2nd largest city in Ruhr area after Dortmund and the 10th largest city in Germany. Essen has also the largest urban density with cities such as Bochum, Gelsenkirchen and Oberhausen borders this city. In 1960, the population reached its historical peak of over 720,000 (Essen was the fifth largest German city at that time) due to its booming industrial era of the Ruhr Area and the West German Wirtschaftswunder. Since 1970s, the population of Essen declined due to loss of jobs by coal and mining. Essen has a large migrant population, most of them are from Turkey, Syria and Poland.

==International relations==
The City of Monessen, Pennsylvania, situated along the Monongahela River, was named after the river and Essen.

===Twin towns – sister cities===

Essen is twinned with:

*Changzhou, China (2015)
*Grenoble, France (1974)
*Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (1991)
*Sunderland, England, United Kingdom (1949)
*Tampere, Finland (1960)
*Tel Aviv, Israel (1991)
*Zabrze, Poland (2015)
===Cooperation agreements===
Essen cooperates with:
*Kōriyama, Japan (2017)
*Qingdao, China (2008)
*Rivne, Ukraine (2022)
*Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia (2012)

== Industry and infrastructure ==

=== Economy ===
Essen is home to several large companies, among them the ThyssenKrupp industrial conglomerate which is also registered in Duisburg and originates from a 1999 merger between Duisburg-based Thyssen AG and Essen-based Friedrich Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp. The largest company registered only in Essen is Germany&#x27;s second-largest electric utility RWE AG. Essen hosts parts of the corporate headquarters of Schenker AG, the logistics division of Deutsche Bahn. Other major companies include Germany&#x27;s largest construction company Hochtief, as well as Aldi Nord, Evonik Industries, Karstadt, Medion AG and Deichmann, Europe&#x27;s largest shoe retailer. The Coca-Cola Company had originally established their German headquarters in Essen (around 1930), where it remained until 2003, when it was moved to the capital Berlin. In light of the Energy transition in Germany, Germany&#x27;s largest electric utility E.ON announced that, after restructuring and splitting off its conventional electricity generation division (coal, gas, atomic energy), it becoming a sole provider of renewable energy. The DAX-listed chemical distribution company Brenntag 
=== Fairs ===

The city&#x27;s exhibition centre, Messe Essen, hosts some 50 trade fairs each year. With around 530.000 visitors each year, Essen Motor Show is by far the largest event held there. It has been described as &quot;the showcase event of the year for the tuning community&quot; and as the German version of the annual SEMA auto show in Las Vegas. As contrasted with the Frankfurt Auto Show, the Essen show is smaller and is focused on car tuning and racing interests. Other important fairs open to consumers include SPIEL, the world&#x27;s biggest consumer fair for tabletop gaming, and one of the leading fairs for equestrian sports, Equitana, held every two years. Important fairs restricted to professionals include &quot;Security&quot; (security and fire protection), IPM (gardening) and E-World (energy and water).
=== Media ===
The Westdeutscher Rundfunk has a studio in Essen, which is responsible for the central Ruhr area. Each day, it produces a 30-minute regional evening news magazine (called ), a five-minute afternoon news programme, and several radio news programmes. A local broadcasting station went on air in the late 1990s. The WAZ Media Group is one of the most important (print) media companies in Europe and publishes the Ruhr area&#x27;s two most important daily newspapers, &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; (WAZ; 580,000 copies) and &quot;Neue Ruhr/Rhein Zeitung&quot; (NRZ; 180,000 copies). In Essen, the WAZ Group also publishes the local &#x27; and &#x27;, both of which had been independent weekly newspapers for parts of Essen. Additionally, Axel Springer run a printing facility for their boulevard-style daily paper &quot;Bild&quot; in Essen.

=== Education ===
One renowned educational institution in Essen is the Folkwang University, a university of the arts founded in 1927, which is headquartered in Essen and has additional facilities in Duisburg, Bochum and Dortmund. Since 1927, its traditional main location has been in the former Werden Abbey in Essen in the Ruhr area, with additional facilities in Duisburg, Bochum, and Dortmund, and, since 2010, at the Zeche Zollverein, a World Heritage Site also in Essen. The Folkwang University is home to the international dance company (FTS). In 1963 the Folkwang school was renamed &quot;Folkwang Academy&quot; (). In 2010 the institution began offering graduate studies and was renamed &quot;Folkwang University of the Arts&quot;. This coincided with Ruhr.2010, the festival in which the Ruhr district was designated the European Capital of Culture for the year 2010.
The University of Duisburg-Essen, which resulted from a 2003 merger of the universities of Essen and Duisburg, is one of Germany&#x27;s &quot;youngest&quot; universities with about 42,000 Students. One of its primary research areas is &quot;urban systems&quot; (i.e., sustainable development, logistics and transportation), a theme largely inspired by the highly urbanised Ruhr area. Other fields include nanotechnology, discrete mathematics and &quot;education in the 21st century&quot;. Another university in Essen is the private , a university of applied sciences with over 6,000 students and branches in 15 other major cities throughout Germany.

=== Medicine ===
Essen offers a highly diversified health care system with more than 1,350 resident doctors and almost 6,000 beds in 13 hospitals, including a university hospital. The university hospital dates back to 1909, when the city council established a municipal hospital; although it was largely destroyed during World War II, it was later rebuilt, and finally gained the title of a university hospital in 1963. It focuses on diseases of the circulatory system (West German Heart Centre Essen), oncology and transplantation medicine, with the department of bone marrow transplantation being the second-largest of its kind in the world.
== Transport ==
=== Streets and motorways ===

The road network of Essen consists of over 3,200 streets, which in total have a length of roughly .

Four &quot;Autobahnen&quot; touch Essen territory, most importantly the A 40, known as (), which runs directly through the city, dividing it roughly in half. In a west-eastern direction, the A 40 connects the Dutch city of Venlo with Dortmund, running through the whole Ruhr area. It is one of the arterial roads of the Ruhr area (carrying over 140,000 vehicles per day) and suffers from heavy congestion during rush hours, which is why many people in the area nicknamed it (). A tunnel was built in the 1970s, when the then-Bundesstraße was upgraded to motorway standards, so that the A 40 is hidden from public view in the inner-city district near the main railway station.

In the north, the A 42 briefly touches Essen territory, serving as an interconnection between the neighboring cities of Oberhausen and Gelsenkirchen and destinations beyond.

A part of the A 44, a highly segmented connection from Aachen and the Belgian border to Kassel, planned to go further into central Germany, ends in Essen&#x27;s south.

A segment of the A 52 connects Essen with the more southern region around Düsseldorf. On Essen territory, the A 52 runs from the southern boroughs near Mülheim an der Ruhr past the fairground and then merges with the Ruhrschnellweg at the Autobahndreieck Essen-Ost junction east of the city centre.

With the A 40/A 52 in the southern parts of the city and the A 42 in the north, there is a gap in the motorway system often leading to congestion on streets leading from the central to the northern boroughs. An extension of the A 52 to connect the Essen-Ost junction with the A 42 to close this gap is considered urgent; it has been planned for years but not yet been realized – most importantly due to the high-density areas this extension would lead through, resulting in high costs and concerns with the citizens.

=== Public transport ===
As with most communes in the Ruhr area, local transport is carried out by a local, publicly owned company for transport within the city, the DB Regio subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn for regional transport and Deutsche Bahn itself for long-distance journeys. The local carrier, Ruhrbahn, is a member of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr (VRR) association of public transport companies in the Ruhr area, which provides a uniform fare structure in the whole region. Within the VRR region, tickets are valid on lines of all members as well as DB&#x27;s railway lines (except the high-speed InterCity and Intercity-Express networks) and can be bought at ticket machines and service centres of Ruhrbahn, all other members of VRR, and DB.

, Ruhrbahn operates 3 U-Stadtbahn lines of the Essen Stadtbahn network, 7 Straßenbahn (tram) lines and 57 bus lines (16 of these serving as late-night lines only). The Stadtbahn and Straßenbahn operate on total route lengths of and , respectively. One tram line and a few bus lines coming from neighboring cities are operated by these cities&#x27; respective carriers. The U-Stadtbahn, which partly runs on used Docklands Light Railway stock, is a mixture of tram and full underground systems with 20 underground stations for the U-Stadtbahn and additional four underground stations used by the tram. Two lines of the U-Stadtbahn are completely intersection-free and hence independent from other traffic, and the U18 line leading from Mülheim main station to the &quot;Bismarckplatz&quot; station at the gates of the city centre partly runs above ground amidst the A 40 motorway. The Essen Stadtbahn is one of the Stadtbahn systems integrated into the greater Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn network.
On the same motorway, a long-term test of a guided bus system is being held since 1980. Many Ruhrbahn rail lines meet at the main station but only a handful of bus lines. However, all but one of the Night Express bus lines either originate from or lead to Essen Hauptbahnhof in a star-shaped manner. All Ruhrbahn lines, including the Night Express lines, are closed on weekdays from 1:30am to 4:30am.

Of the Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn network&#x27;s 13 lines, 5 lines lead through Essen territory and meet at the Essen Hauptbahnhof main station, which also serves as the connection to the Regional-Express and Intercity-Express network of regional and nationwide high-speed trains, respectively. Following Essen&#x27;s appointment as European Capital of Culture 2010, the main station, which is classified as a station of highest importance and which had not been substantially renovated over decades, Other important stations in Essen, where regional and local traffic are connected, are the (regional railway stations) in the boroughs of Altenessen, Borbeck, Kray and Steele. Further 20 S-Bahn stations can be found in the whole urban area.

In 2017, the public transport organization of Mülheim, the Mülheimer Verkehrsgesellschaft (MVG) and the Essener Verkehrsgesellschaft (EVAG) merged and became the &quot;Ruhrbahn&quot;. All vehicles and staff were merged and are now operated together.

=== Aviation ===

Together with the neighbouring city of Mülheim an der Ruhr and the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Essen maintains Essen/Mülheim Airport (IATA: ESS, ICAO: EDLE). While the first flights had already arrived in 1919, it was officially opened on 25 August 1925. Significantly expanded in 1935, Essen/Mülheim became the central airport of the Ruhr area until the end of the Second World War, providing an asphalted runway of , another unsurfaced runway for gliding and destinations to most major European cities. It was heavily damaged during the war, yet partly reconstructed and used by the Allies as a secondary airport since visibility is less often obscured than at Düsseldorf Airport. The latter then developed into the large civil airport that it is now, while Essen/Mülheim now mainly serves occasional air traffic (some 33,000 passengers each year), the base of a fleet of airships and Germany&#x27;s oldest public flight training company. Residents of the region around Essen typically use Düsseldorf Airport (about 20 driving minutes) and occasionally Dortmund Airport (about 30 driving minutes) for both domestic and international flights.

== Landmarks ==

=== Zollverein Industrial Complex ===
The Zollverein Coal Mine Industrial Complex is the city&#x27;s most famous landmark. For decades, the coal mine (current form mainly from 1932, closed in 1986) and the coking plant (closed in 1993) ranked among the largest of their kinds in Europe. Shaft XII, built in Bauhaus style, with its characteristic winding tower, which over the years has become a symbol for the whole Ruhr area, is considered an architectural and technical masterpiece, earning it a reputation as the &quot;most beautiful coal mine in the world&quot;. After UNESCO had declared it a World Heritage Site in 2001, the complex, which had lain idle for a long time and was even threatened to be demolished, began to see a period of redevelopment. Under the direction of an agency borne by the land of North Rhine-Westphalia and the city itself, several arts and design institutions settled mainly on the grounds of the former coal mine; a redevelopment plan for the coking plant is to be realised.

On the grounds of the coal mine and the coking plant, which are both accessible free of charge while paid guided tours (some with former ) are available, several tourist attractions can be found, most importantly the &quot;Design Zentrum NRW&quot;/Red Dot Design Museum. The &quot;Ruhrmuseum&quot;, a museum dedicated to the history of the Ruhr area, which had been existing since 1904, opened its gates as one of the anchor attractions in the former coal-washing facility in 2010.
=== Essen Minster and treasury ===
The former collegiate church of Essen Abbey and nowadays cathedral of the Bishop of Essen is a Gothic hall church made from light sandstone. The first church on the premises dates back to between 845 and 870; the current church was constructed after a former church had burnt down in 1275. However, the important westwork and crypt have survived from Ottonian times. The cathedral is located in the centre of the city which evolved around it. It is not spectacular in appearance and the adjacent church &quot;St. Johann Baptist&quot;, which is located directly within the pedestrian precinct, is often mistakenly referred to as the cathedral. The cathedral treasury, however, ranks amongst the most important in Germany since only few art works have been lost over the centuries. The most precious exhibit, located within the cathedral, is the Golden Madonna of Essen (around 980), the oldest known sculpture of the Madonna and the oldest free-standing sculpture north of the Alps. Other exhibits include the alleged &quot;child crown&quot; of Emperor Otto III, the eldest preserved seven-branched Christian candelabrum and several other art works from Ottonian times.
=== Old Synagogue ===

Opened in 1913, the then-New Synagogue served as the central meeting place of Essen&#x27;s pre-war Jewish community. The building ranks as one of the largest and most impressive testimonies of Jewish culture in pre-war Germany. In post-war Germany, the former house of worship was bought by the city, used as an exhibition hall and later rededicated as a cultural meeting centre and house of Jewish culture.
=== Villa Hügel ===
Built in 1873 by industrial magnate Alfred Krupp, Villa Hügel, the 269-room mansion () and the surrounding park of served as the Krupp family&#x27;s representative seat. The city&#x27;s land register solely lists the property, which at times had a staff of up to 640 people, as a single-family home. At the time of its construction, the villa featured some technical novelties and peculiarities, such as a central hot air heating system, own water- and gas works and electric internal and external telegraph- and telephone systems (with a central induction alarm for the staff). The mansion&#x27;s central clock became the reference clock for the whole Krupp enterprise; every clock was to be set with a maximum difference of half a minute. It even acquired its own railway station, &quot;Essen Hügel&quot;, which is still a regular stop. The Krupp family had to leave the mansion in 1945, when it was annexed by the allies. Given back in 1952, Villa Hügel is now seat of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation (major shareholder of Thyssen-Krupp) and was opened for concerts and sporadic yet high-profile exhibitions.
=== Kettwig and Werden ===

In the south of the city, the boroughs of Kettwig and Werden exceptionally stand for towns once of their own, which have been annexed in 1929 (Werden) and 1975 (Kettwig), respectively, and which have largely preserved their pre-annexation character. While most of the northern boroughs were heavily damaged during the Second World War and often lost their historic town centres; the more southern parts got off more lightly.

In Werden, St. Ludger founded Werden Abbey around 799, 45 years before St. Altfrid founded the later cornerstone of the modern city, Essen Abbey. The old church of Werden abbey, &quot;St. Ludgerus&quot;, was designated a papal basilica minor in 1993, while the main building of the former abbey today is the headquarters of the Folkwang University of music and performing arts.

Kettwig, which was annexed in 1975, much to the dismay of the population that still struggles for independence, was mainly shaped by the textile industry. The most southern borough of Essen is also the city&#x27;s largest (with regard to area) and presumably greenest.

=== Other important cultural sites ===
* Museum Folkwang: One of the Ruhr area&#x27;s major art collections, mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries. Major parts of the museum have recently been rebuilt and expanded according to plans by David Chipperfield &amp; Co. The Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation is the sole funder of the €55 million project which was completed in early 2010. After its re-opening, it also hosts the collection of the &quot;Deutsches Plakat Museum&quot; (more than 340 000 exhibits).
* Aalto Theatre: Opened in 1988 (the plans dating back to 1959), the asymmetric building with its deep indigo interior is home to the acclaimed Essen Opera and Ballet.
* Saalbau Essen: Home of the Essen Philharmonic Orchestra, completely renovated in 2003/2004. Critics have repeatedly voted the Essen Philharmonic as Germany&#x27;s Orchestra of the Year.
* Colosseum Theater: Situated in a former Krupp factory building at the fringe of the central pedestrian precinct, the has been home to several musical theatre productions since 1996.
* Zeche Carl, a former coal mine, now a cultural centre and venue for Rock concerts and home of Offener Kanal Essen.
* Grillo-Theater, a theatre in the centre of the city.

=== Other sites ===
* Gartenstadt Margarethenhöhe: Founded by Margarethe Krupp in 1906, the garden city with its 3092 units in 935 buildings on an area of (of which 50 ha are woodland) is considered the first of its kind in Germany. All buildings follow the same stylistic concept, with slight variations for each one. Although originally designed as an area for the lower classes with quite small flats, the old part Margarethenhöhe I has developed into a middle class residential area and housing space has become highly sought after. A new part, Margarehenhöhe II, was built in the 1960s and 1970s but is architecturally inferior and especially the multi-storey buildings are still considered social hot spots.
*Moltkeviertel (Moltke Quarter): from 1908 on, following reformative plans of the city deputy &quot;Robert Schmidt&quot;, this quarter was developed just south-east of the city centre. Large green zones, forming broad urban ventilation lanes and incorporating sporting and playing areas and high quality architecture – invariably in the style of Reform Architecture, combine to create a unique example worldwide of modern town planning. It reflects reformative ideas and dates from the early part of the 20th century.

=== Honorary citizens ===
The city of Essen has been awarding honorary citizenships since 1879 but has (coincidentally) discontinued this tradition after the foundation of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. A notable exception was made in 2007, when Berthold Beitz, the president of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation received honorary citizenship for his long lasting commitment to the city.
The following list contains all honorary citizens of the city of Essen:
*1879 Otto von BismarckChancellor of Germany
*1888 politician, lawyer and economist
*1895 Roman catholic theologian
*1896 Friedrich Alfred Kruppindustrialist &quot;(spouse of Margarethe Krupp, see below)&quot;
*1901 Heinrich Carl Söllingtradesman and benefactor
*1906 Lord Mayor (1886–1906)
*1912 benefactress &quot;(spouse of Friedrich Alfred Krupp, see above)&quot;
*1917 Paul von HindenburgGeneralfeldmarschall and army leader, later President of Germany
*1949 Viktor Niemeyercouncilman &quot;(posthumous recognition)&quot;
*2007 Berthold Beitzpresident of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation
Today, the highest award of the city is the &quot;Ring of Honour&quot;, which Berthold Beitz, for example, had already received in 1983. Other bearers of the Ring of Honour include Essen&#x27;s former Lord Mayor and later President of Germany, Gustav Heinemann, as well as Franz Cardinal Hengsbach, the first Bishop of Essen. Berthold Beitz (1973) and his wife Else Beitz (2006) are recipients of the Righteous Among the Nations recognized by the Yad Vashem for having saved about 800 Jewish lives during World War II.

<text>The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress from This World, to That Which Is to Come is a 1678 Christian allegory written by John Bunyan. It is commonly regarded as one of the most significant works of Protestant devotional literature and of wider early modern English literature. It has been translated into more than 200 languages and has never been out of print. It appeared in Dutch in 1681, in German in 1703 and in Swedish in 1727. The first North American edition was issued in 1681. It has also been cited as the first novel written in English. According to literary editor Robert McCrum, &quot;there&#x27;s no book in English, apart from the Bible, to equal Bunyan&#x27;s masterpiece for the range of its readership, or its influence on writers as diverse as William Hogarth, C. S. Lewis, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Dickens, Louisa May Alcott, George Bernard Shaw, William Thackeray, Charlotte Bronte, Mark Twain, John Steinbeck and Enid Blyton.&quot; The lyrics of the hymn &quot;To be a Pilgrim&quot; are based on the novel.

Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act 1664, which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars such as John Brown believed &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was begun in Bunyan&#x27;s second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675, but more recent scholars such as Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan&#x27;s initial, more lengthy imprisonment from 1660 to 1672 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography &quot;Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot;.

The English text comprises 108,260 words and is divided into two parts, each reading as a continuous narrative with no chapter divisions. The first part was completed in 1677 and entered into the Stationers&#x27; Register on 22 December 1677. It was licensed and entered in the &quot;Term Catalogue&quot; on 18 February 1678, which is looked upon as the date of first publication. After the first edition of the first part in 1678, an expanded edition, with additions written after Bunyan was freed, appeared in 1679. The Second Part appeared in 1684. There were eleven editions of the first part in John Bunyan&#x27;s lifetime, published in successive years from 1678 to 1685 and in 1688, and there were two editions of the second part, published in 1684 and 1686.

== Plot summary ==

=== First Part ===
The entire book is presented as a dream sequence narrated by an omniscient narrator. The allegory&#x27;s protagonist, Christian, is an everyman character, and the plot centres on his journey from his hometown, the &quot;City of Destruction&quot; (&quot;this world&quot;), to the &quot;Celestial City&quot; (&quot;that which is to come&quot;: Heaven) atop Mount Zion. Christian is weighed down by a great burden—the knowledge of his sin—which he believed came from his reading &quot;the book in his hand&quot; (the Bible). This burden, which would cause him to sink into Hell, is so unbearable that Christian must seek deliverance. He meets Evangelist as he is walking out in the fields, who directs him to the &quot;Wicket Gate&quot; for deliverance. Since Christian cannot see the &quot;Wicket Gate&quot; in the distance, Evangelist directs him to go to a &quot;shining light&quot;, which Christian thinks he sees. Christian leaves his home, his wife, and children to save himself: he cannot persuade them to accompany him. Obstinate and Pliable go after Christian to bring him back, but Christian refuses. Obstinate returns disgusted, but Pliable is persuaded to go with Christian, hoping to take advantage of the Paradise that Christian claims lies at the end of his journey. Pliable&#x27;s journey with Christian is cut short when the two of them fall into the Slough of Despond, a boggy mire-like swamp where pilgrims&#x27; doubts, fears, temptations, lusts, shames, guilts, and sins of their present condition of being a sinner are used to sink them into the mud of the swamp. It is there in that bog where Pliable abandons Christian after getting himself out. After struggling to the other side of the slough, Christian is pulled out by Help, who has heard his cries and tells him the swamp is made out of the decadence, scum, and filth of sin, but the ground is good at the narrow Wicket Gate.
On his way to the Wicket Gate, Christian is diverted by the secular ethics of Mr. Worldly Wiseman into seeking deliverance from his burden through the Law, supposedly with the help of a Mr. Legality and his son Civility in the village of Morality, rather than through Christ, allegorically by way of the Wicket Gate. Evangelist meets the wayward Christian as he stops before Mount Sinai on the way to Mr. Legality&#x27;s home. It hangs over the road and threatens to crush any who would pass it; also the mountain flashes with fire. Evangelist exposes Worldly Wiseman, Legality, and Civility for the frauds they are: they would have the pilgrim leave the true path by trusting in his own good deeds to remove his burden. Evangelist directs Christian to return to the way to the Wicket Gate, and Christian complies.

At the Wicket Gate begins the &quot;straight and narrow&quot; King&#x27;s Highway, and Christian is directed onto it by the gatekeeper Goodwill who saves him from Beelzebub&#x27;s archers at Beelzebub&#x27;s castle near the Wicket Gate and shows him the heavenly way he must go. In the Second Part, Goodwill is shown to be Jesus Himself. To Christian&#x27;s query about relief from his burden, Goodwill directs him forward to &quot;the place of deliverance&quot;.

Christian makes his way from there to the House of the Interpreter, where he is shown pictures and that portray or dramatize aspects of the Christian faith and life. Roger Sharrock denotes them &quot;emblems&quot;.

From the House of the Interpreter, Christian finally reaches the &quot;place of deliverance&quot; (allegorically, the cross of Calvary and the open sepulchre of Christ), where the &quot;straps&quot; that bound Christian&#x27;s burden to him break, and it rolls away into the open sepulchre. This event happens relatively early in the narrative: the immediate need of Christian at the beginning of the story is quickly remedied. After Christian is relieved of his burden, he is greeted by three angels, who give him the greeting of peace, new garments, and a scroll as a passport into the Celestial City. Encouraged by all this, Christian happily continues his journey until he comes upon three men named Simple, Sloth, and Presumption. Christian tries to help them, but they disregard his advice. Before coming to the Hill of Difficulty, Christian meets two well-dressed men named Formality and Hypocrisy who prove to be false Christians that perish in the two dangerous bypasses near the hill, named Danger and Destruction. Christian falls asleep at the arbour above the hill and loses his scroll, forcing him to go back and get it. Near the top of the Hill of Difficulty, he meets two weak pilgrims named Mistrust and Timorous who tell him of the great lions of the Palace Beautiful. Christian fearfully avoids the lions through Watchful the porter who tells them that they are chained and put there to test the faith of pilgrims.

Atop the Hill of Difficulty, Christian makes his first stop for the night at the House of the Palace Beautiful, which is a place built by God for the refreshment of pilgrims and godly travellers. Christian spends three days here, and leaves clothed with the Armour of God (Eph. 6:11–18), which stands him in good stead in his battle against the demonic dragon-like Apollyon (the lord and god of the City of Destruction) in the Valley of Humiliation. This battle lasts &quot;over half a day&quot; until Christian manages to wound and stab Apollyon with his two-edged sword (a reference to the Bible, Heb. 4:12). &quot;And with that Apollyon spread his dragon wings and sped away.&quot;

As night falls, Christian enters the fearful Valley of the Shadow of Death. When he is in the middle of the Valley amidst the gloom, terror, and demons, he hears the words of the Twenty-third Psalm, spoken possibly by his friend Faithful: Yea, though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4.) As he leaves this valley the sun rises on a new day.

Just outside the Valley of the Shadow of Death he meets Faithful, also a former resident of the City of Destruction, who accompanies him to Vanity Fair, a place built by Beelzebub where every thing to a human&#x27;s taste, delight, and lust is sold daily, where both are arrested and detained because of their disdain for the wares and business of the Fair. Faithful is put on trial and executed by burning at the stake as a martyr. A celestial chariot then takes Faithful to the Celestial City, martyrdom being a shortcut there. Hopeful, a resident of Vanity Fair, takes Faithful&#x27;s place to be Christian&#x27;s companion for the rest of the way.

Christian and Hopeful then come to a hill called Lucre where there is a silver mine. A man called Demas urges them to join in the mining going on, but Christian sees through Demas&#x27;s trickery and they avoid the mine. Afterward, a false pilgrim named By-Ends and his friends, who followed Christian and Hopeful only to take advantage of them, perish at the Hill Lucre, never to be seen or heard from again. On a rough, stony stretch of road, Christian and Hopeful leave the highway to travel on the easier By-Path Meadow, where a rainstorm forces them to spend the night. In the morning they are captured by Giant Despair, who is known for his savage cruelty, and his wife Diffidence; the pilgrims are taken to the Giant&#x27;s Doubting Castle, where they are imprisoned, beaten and starved. The Giant and the Giantess want them to commit suicide, but they endure the ordeal until Christian realizes that a key he has, called Promise, will open all the doors and gates of Doubting Castle. Using the key and the Giant&#x27;s vulnerability to sunlight, they escape.

The Delectable Mountains form the next stage of Christian and Hopeful&#x27;s journey, where the shepherds show them some of the wonders of the place also known as &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s Land&quot;. The pilgrims are shown sights that strengthen their faith and warn them against sinning, like the Hill Error or the Mountain Caution. On Mount Clear, they are able to see the Celestial City through the shepherd&#x27;s &quot;perspective glass&quot;, which serves as a telescope. (This device is given to Mercy in the Second Part at her request.) The shepherds tell the pilgrims to beware of the Flatterer and to avoid the Enchanted Ground. Soon they come to a crossroad and a man dressed in white comes to help them. Thinking he is a &quot;shining one&quot; (angel), the pilgrims follow the man, but soon get stuck in a net and realize their so-called angelic guide was the Flatterer. A true shining one comes and frees them from the net. The Angel punishes them for following the Flatterer and then puts them back on the right path. The pilgrims meet an Atheist, who tells them Heaven and God do not exist, but Christian and Hopeful remember the shepherds and pay no attention to the man. Christian and Hopeful come to a place where a man named Wanton Professor is chained by the ropes of seven demons who take him to a shortcut to the Lake of Fire (Hell). This reminds them of a man named Little Faith, who had been mugged by thieves that stole his spending money and resulted in him having a hard life, although the thieves did not take Little Faith&#x27;s scroll or his jewels, which he kept safe through his journey.

On the way, Christian and Hopeful meet a lad named Ignorance, who believes that he will be allowed into the Celestial City through his own good deeds rather than as a gift of God&#x27;s grace. Christian and Hopeful meet up with him twice and try to persuade him to journey to the Celestial City in the right way. Ignorance persists in his own way that he thinks will lead him into Heaven. After getting over the River of Death on the ferry boat of Vain Hope without overcoming the hazards of wading across it, Ignorance appears before the gates of Celestial City without a passport, which he would have acquired had he gone into the King&#x27;s Highway through the Wicket Gate. The Lord of the Celestial City orders the shining ones (angels) to take Ignorance to one of the byways of Hell and throw him in.

Christian and Hopeful, with deep discourse about the truth of their glorious salvation, manage to make it through the dangerous Enchanted Ground (a place where the air makes them sleepy and if they fall asleep, they never wake up) into the Land of Beulah, where they ready themselves to cross the dreaded River of Death on foot to Mount Zion and the Celestial City. Christian has a rough time of it because of his past sins wearing him down, but Hopeful helps him over, and they are welcomed into the Celestial City.

=== Second Part ===

The Second Part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; presents the pilgrimage of Christian&#x27;s wife, Christiana, and their sons, and the maiden, Mercy. They visit the same stopping places that Christian visited, with the addition of Gaius&#x27; Inn between the Valley of the Shadow of Death and Vanity Fair, but they take a longer time in order to accommodate marriage and childbirth for the four sons and their wives. The hero of the story is Greatheart, a servant of the Interpreter, who is the pilgrims&#x27; guide to the Celestial City. He kills four giants called Giant Grim, Giant Maul, Giant Slay-Good, and Giant Despair and participates in the slaying of a monster called Legion that terrorizes the city of Vanity Fair.

When Christiana&#x27;s party leaves Gaius&#x27;s Inn and Mr. Feeble-Mind lingers in order to be left behind, he is encouraged to accompany the party by Greatheart. Christiana, Matthew, Samuel, Joseph, James, Mercy, Greatheart, Old Mr. Honest, Mr. Feeble-Mind, Mr. Ready-To-Halt, Phoebe, Grace, and Martha come to Bypath-Meadow and, after much fight and difficulty, slay the cruel Giant Despair and the wicked Giantess Diffidence, and demolish Doubting Castle for Christian and Hopeful who were oppressed there. They free a pale man named Mr. Despondency and his daughter named Much-Afraid from the castle&#x27;s dungeons.

When the pilgrims end up in the Land of Beulah, they cross over the River of Death by appointment. As a matter of importance to Christians of Bunyan&#x27;s persuasion reflected in the narrative of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the last words of the pilgrims as they cross over the River of Death are recorded. The four sons of Christian and their families do not cross but remain for the support of the church in that place.

== Characters ==

=== First Part ===
* Christian, who was born with the name Graceless, the protagonist in the First Part, whose journey to the Celestial City is the plot of the story.
* Evangelist, the religious man who puts Christian on the path to the Celestial City. He also shows Christian a scroll on which is written: &quot;Flee from the wrath to come&quot;, a possible symbol of the Bible.
* Obstinate, one of the two residents of the City of Destruction, who run after Christian when he first sets out, in order to bring him back. Like his name, he is stubborn and is disgusted with Christian and with Pliable for making a journey that he thinks is nonsense.
* Pliable, the other of the two, who goes with Christian until both of them fall into the Slough of Despond, a boggy mire composed of the decadence and filthiness of sin and a swamp that makes the fears and doubts of a present and past sinner real. Pliable escapes from the slough and returns home. Like his name, he is insecure and goes along with some things for a little while but quickly gives up on them.
* Help, Christian&#x27;s rescuer from the Slough of Despond.
* Mr. Worldly Wiseman, a resident of a place called Carnal Policy, who persuades Christian to go out of his way to being helped by a friend named Mr. Legality and then move to the City of Morality (which focuses salvation on the Law and good deeds instead of faith and love in Jesus Christ). His real advice is from the world and not from God, meaning his advice is flawed and consists of three objectives: getting Christian off the right path, making the cross of Jesus Christ offensive to him, and binding him to the Law so he would die with his sins. Worldly Wiseman has brought down many innocent pilgrims and there will be many more to come.
* Goodwill, the keeper of the Wicket Gate through which one enters the &quot;straight and narrow way&quot; (also referred to as &quot;the King&#x27;s Highway&quot;) to the Celestial City. In the Second Part, we find that this character is none other than Jesus Christ Himself.
* Beelzebub, literally &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;, is one of Satan&#x27;s companion archdemons, who has erected a fort near the Wicket Gate from which he and his soldiers can shoot arrows of fire at those about to enter the Wicket Gate so they will never enter it. He is also the lord, god, king, master, and prince of Vanity Fair. Christian calls him &quot;captain&quot; of the Foul Fiend Apollyon, who he later met in the Valley of Humiliation.
* The Interpreter, the one who has his House along the way as a rest stop for travellers to check in to see pictures and dioramas to teach them the right way to live the Christian life. He has been identified in the Second Part as the Holy Spirit.
* Shining Ones, the messengers and servants of &quot;the Lord of the Hill&quot;, God. They are obviously the holy angels.
* Formalist, one of two travelers and false pilgrims on the King&#x27;s Highway, who do not come in by the Wicket Gate, but climb over the wall that encloses it, at least from the hill and sepulchres up to the Hill Difficulty. He and his companion Hypocrisy come from the land of Vainglory. He takes one of the two bypaths that avoid the Hill Difficulty but is lost.
* Hypocrisy, the companion of Formalist and the other false pilgrim. He takes the other of the two bypaths and is also lost.
* Timorous, one of two men who try to persuade Christian to go back for fear of the chained lions near the House Beautiful. He is a relative of Mrs. Timorous of the Second Part. His companion is Mistrust.
* Mistrust, the other of the two men who tried to persuade Christian back because of the lions. He is the companion of Timorous. Later, he and Timorous were executed for trying to convince Christian.
* Watchful, the porter of the House Beautiful. He also appears in the Second Part and receives &quot;a gold angel&quot; coin from Christiana for his kindness and service to her and her companions. &quot;Watchful&quot; is also the name of one of the Delectable Mountains&#x27; shepherds.
* Discretion, one of the beautiful maids of the house, who decides to allow Christian to stay there.
* Prudence, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part.
* Piety, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part.
* Charity, another of the House Beautiful maidens. She appears in the Second Part.
* Apollyon, literally &quot;Destroyer&quot;; the king, lord, god, master, prince, owner, landlord, ruler, governor, and leader of the City of Destruction where Christian was born. He is an image of Satan, who tries to force Christian to return to his domain and service. His battle with Christian takes place in the Valley of Humiliation, just below the House Beautiful. He appears as a huge demonic creature with fish&#x27;s scales, the mouth of a lion, feet of a bear, second mouth on his belly, and dragon&#x27;s wings. He takes fiery darts from his body to throw at his opponents. Apollyon is finally defeated when Christian uses the Sword of the Spirit to wound him two times.
* &quot;Pope&quot; and &quot;Pagan&quot;, giants living in a cave at the end of the fearsome Valley of the Shadow of Death. They are allegories of Roman Catholicism and paganism as persecutors of Protestant Christians. &quot;Pagan&quot; is dead, indicating the end of pagan persecution with Antiquity, and &quot;Pope&quot; is alive but decrepit, indicating the then-diminished power and influence of the Roman Catholic pope. In the Second Part, Pagan is resurrected by a demon from the bottomless pit of the Valley of the Shadow of Death, representing the new age of pagan persecution, and Pope is revived of his deadly wounds and is no longer stiff and unable to move, representing the beginning of the Christian&#x27;s troubles with Roman Catholic popes.
* Faithful, Christian&#x27;s friend from the City of Destruction, who is also going on pilgrimage. Christian meets Faithful just after getting through the Valley of The Shadow of Death. He dies later in Vanity Fair for his strong faith and first reaches the Celestial City.
* Wanton, a temptress who tries to get Faithful to leave his journey to the Celestial City. She may be the popular resident of the City of Destruction, Madam Wanton, who hosted a house party for friends of Mrs. Timorous.
* Adam the First, &quot;the old man&quot; (representing carnality and deceit) who tries to persuade Faithful to leave his journey and come live with his three daughters: the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes, and the Pride of Life.
* Moses, the severe, violent avenger (representing the Law, which knows no mercy) who tries to kill Faithful for his momentary weakness in wanting to go with Adam the First out of the way. Moses is sent away by Jesus Christ.
* Talkative, a pilgrim that Faithful and Christian meet after going through the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He is known to Christian as a fellow resident of the City of Destruction, living on Prating Row. He is the son of Say-Well and Mrs. Talk-About-The-Right Things. He is said to be better-looking from a distance than close up. His enthusiasm for talking about his faith to Faithful deceives him into thinking that he is a sincere man. Christian lets Faithful know about his unsavoury past, and in a conversation that Faithful strikes up with him, he is exposed as shallow and hypocritical in his Christianity.
* Lord Hate-Good, the evil judge who tries Faithful in Vanity Fair. Lord Hate-Good is the opposite of a judge, he hates right and loves wrong because he does wrong himself. His jury is twelve vicious rogue men.
* Envy, the first witness against Faithful who falsely accuses that Faithful shows no respect for their prince, Lord Beelzebub.
* Superstition, the second witness against Faithful who falsely accuses Faithful of saying that their religion is vain.
* Pick-Thank, the third witness against Faithful who falsely accuses Faithful of going against their prince, their people, their laws, their &quot;honourable&quot; friends, and the judge himself.
* Hopeful, the resident of Vanity Fair, who takes Faithful&#x27;s place as Christian&#x27;s fellow traveller. The character Hopeful poses an inconsistency in that there is a necessity imposed on the pilgrims that they enter the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; by the Wicket Gate. Hopeful, did not; however, of him, we read &quot;... one died to bear testimony to the truth, and another rises out of his ashes to be a companion with Christian in his pilgrimage.&quot; Hopeful assumes Faithful&#x27;s place by God&#x27;s design. Theologically and allegorically it would follow in that &quot;faith&quot; is trust in God as far as things present are concerned, and &quot;hope&quot;, biblically the same as &quot;faith&quot;, is trust in God as far as things of the future are concerned. Hopeful would follow Faithful. The other factor is that Vanity Fair is right on the straight and narrow way. Ignorance, in contrast to Hopeful, was unconcerned about the end times of God, unconcerned with true faith in Jesus Christ, and gave false hope about the future. Ignorance was told by Christian and Hopeful that he should have entered the highway through the Wicket Gate.
* Mr. By-Ends, a false pilgrim met by Christian and Hopeful after they leave Vanity Fair. He makes it his aim to avoid any hardship or persecution that Christians may have to undergo. He supposedly perishes in the Hill Lucre (a dangerous silver mine) with three of his friends, Hold-the-World, Money-Love, and Save-All, at the behest of Demas, who invites passersby to come and see the mine. A &quot;by-end&quot; is a pursuit that is achieved indirectly. For By-Ends and his companions it is the pursuit of financial gain, indirectly through religion.
* Demas, a deceiver, who beckons to pilgrims at the Hill Lucre to come and join in the supposed silver mining going on in it. He is first mentioned in the Book of Second Timothy by the disciple Paul when he said, &quot;Demas has deserted us because he loved the world&quot;. Demas tries two ways to trick Christian and Hopeful: first, he claims that the mine is safe and they will be rich, and then he claims that he is a pilgrim and will join them on their journey. Christian, filled with the Holy Spirit, is able to rebuke Demas and expose his lies.
* Giant Despair, the savage owner of Doubting Castle, where pilgrims are imprisoned and tortured. He is slain by Greatheart in the Second Part.
* Giantess Diffidence, Despair&#x27;s wife, known to be cruel, savage, violent, and evil like her husband. She is slain by Old Honest in the Second Part.
* Knowledge, one of the shepherds of the Delectable Mountains.
* Experience, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds.
* Watchful, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds.
* Sincere, another of the Delectable Mountains shepherds.
* Ignorance, &quot;the brisk young lad&quot; (representing foolishness and conceit) who joins the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; by way of the &quot;crooked lane&quot; that comes from his native country, called &quot;Conceit&quot;. He follows Christian and Hopeful and on two occasions talks with them. He believes that he will be received into the Celestial City because of his doing good works in accordance with God&#x27;s will. For him, Jesus Christ is only an example, not a Saviour. Christian and Hopeful try to set him right, but they fail. He gets a ferryman, Vain-Hope, to ferry him across the River of Death rather than cross it on foot as one is supposed to do. When he gets to the gates of the Celestial City, he is asked for a &quot;certificate&quot; needed for entry, which he does not have. The King upon hearing this, then, orders that he be bound and cast into Hell.
* The Flatterer, a deceiver dressed as an angel who leads Christian and Hopeful out of their way, when they fail to look at the road map given them by the Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains.
* Atheist, a mocker of Christian and Hopeful, who goes the opposite way on the &quot;King&#x27;s Highway&quot; because he boasts that he knows that God and the Celestial City do not exist.

=== Second Part ===
* Mr. Sagacity, a guest narrator who meets Bunyan himself in his new dream and recounts the events of the Second Part up to the arrival at the Wicket Gate.
* Christiana, wife of Christian, who leads her four sons and neighbour Mercy on pilgrimage.
* Matthew, Christian and Christiana&#x27;s eldest son, who marries Mercy.
* Samuel, the second son, who marries Grace, Mr. Mnason&#x27;s daughter.
* Joseph, the third son, who marries Martha, Mr. Mnason&#x27;s daughter.
* James, fourth and youngest son, who marries Phoebe, Gaius&#x27;s daughter.
* Mercy, Christiana&#x27;s neighbour, who goes with her on pilgrimage and marries Matthew.
* Mrs. Timorous, a relative of the Timorous of the First Part, who comes with Mercy to see Christiana before she sets out on pilgrimage.
* Mrs. Bat&#x27;s-Eyes, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. Since she has a bat&#x27;s eyes, she would be blind or nearly blind, so her characterization of Christiana as blind in her desire to go on pilgrimage is hypocritical.
* Mrs. Inconsiderate, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She characterizes Christiana&#x27;s departure &quot;a good riddance&quot; as an inconsiderate person would.
* Mrs. Light-Mind, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She changes the subject from Christiana to gossip about being at a bawdy party at Madam Wanton&#x27;s home.
* Mrs. Know-Nothing, a resident of The City of Destruction and friend of Mrs. Timorous. She wonders if Christiana will actually go on pilgrimage.
* Ill-favoured Ones, two evil characters Christiana sees in her dream, whom she and Mercy actually encounter when they leave the Wicket Gate. The two Ill Ones are driven off by Great-Heart himself.
* Innocent, a young serving maid of the Interpreter, who answers the door of the house when Christiana and her companions arrive; and who conducts them to the garden bath, which signifies Christian baptism.
* Mr. Greatheart, the guide and bodyguard sent by the Interpreter with Christiana and her companions from his house to their journey&#x27;s end. He proves to be one of the main protagonists in the Second Part.
* Giant Grim, a Giant who &quot;backs the [chained] lions&quot; near the House Beautiful, slain by Great-Heart. He is also known as &quot;Bloody-Man&quot; because he has killed many pilgrims or sent them on mazes of detours, where they were lost forever.
* Humble-Mind, one of the maidens of the House Beautiful, who makes her appearance in the Second Part. She questions Matthew, James, Samuel, and Joseph about their godly faith and their hearts to the Lord God.
* Mr. Brisk, a suitor of Mercy&#x27;s, who gives up courting her when he finds out that she makes clothing only to give away to the poor. He is shown to be a foppish, worldly-minded person who is double-minded about his beliefs.
* Mr. Skill, the godly physician called to the House Beautiful to cure Matthew of his illness, which is caused by eating the forbidden apples and fruits of Beelzebub which his mother told him not to, but he did it anyway.
* Giant Maul, a Giant whom Greatheart kills as the pilgrims leave the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He holds a grudge against Greatheart for doing his duty of saving pilgrims from damnation and bringing them from darkness to light, from evil to good, and from Satan, the Devil to Jesus Christ, the Saviour.
* Old Honest, a pilgrim from the frozen town of Stupidity who joins them, a welcome companion to Greatheart. Old Honest tells the stories of Mr. Fearing and a prideful villain named Mr. Self-Will.
* Mr. Fearing, a fearful pilgrim from the City of Destruction whom Greatheart had &quot;conducted&quot; to the Celestial City in an earlier pilgrimage. Noted for his timidness of Godly Fears such as temptations and doubts. He is Mr. Feeble-Mind&#x27;s uncle.
* Gaius, an innkeeper with whom the pilgrims stay for some years after they leave the Valley of the Shadow of Death. He gives his daughter Phoebe to James in marriage. The lodging fee for his inn is paid by the Good Samaritan. Gaius tells them of the wicked Giant Slay-Good.
* Giant Slay-Good, a Giant who enlists the help of evildoers on the King&#x27;s Highway to abduct, murder, and consume pilgrims before they get to Vanity Fair. He is killed by Greatheart.
* Mr. Feeble-Mind, rescued from Slay-Good by Mr. Greatheart, who joins Christiana&#x27;s company of pilgrims. He is the nephew of Mr. Fearing.
* Phoebe, Gaius&#x27;s daughter, who marries James.
* Mr. Ready-to-Halt, a pilgrim who meets Christiana&#x27;s train of pilgrims at Gaius&#x27;s door, and becomes the companion of Mr. Feeble-Mind, to whom he gives one of his crutches.

* Christian and Christiana&#x27;s Grandchildren, the children of Matthew, Samuel, Joseph, James and their respective wives(Mercy, Grace, Martha, and Phoebe). Born in Vanity Fair, they are left in the care of other pilgrims in a place where the children of pilgrims are raised for a time, due to being at a very tender age. They rejoin their parents by the time the pilgrims reach the Enchanted Ground. The exact number of children per couple, as well as their names and sexes is never disclosed.
* Mr. Despondency, a rescued prisoner from Doubting Castle owned by the miserable Giant Despair.
* Much-Afraid, his daughter.
* Mr. Valiant-For-Truth, a pilgrim they find all bloody, with his sword in his hand, after leaving the Delectable Mountains. He fought and defeated three robbers called Faint-Heart, Mistrust, and Guilt.
* Mr. Stand-Fast, a pilgrim found while praying for deliverance from Madame Bubble.
* Madame Bubble, a witch whose enchantments made the Enchanted Ground enchanted with an air that makes foolish pilgrims sleepy and never wake up again. She is the adulterous woman mentioned in the Biblical &quot;Book of Proverbs&quot;. Mr. Self-Will went over a bridge to meet her and never came back again.

== Places in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; ==

* City of Destruction, Christian&#x27;s home, representative of the world (cf. Isaiah 19:18)
* Slough of Despond, the miry swamp on the way to the Wicket Gate; one of the hazards of the journey to the Celestial City. In the First Part, Christian, falling into it, sank further under the weight of his sins (his burden) and his sense of their guilt.
* Mount Sinai, a frightening mountain near the Village of Morality that threatens all who would go there.
* Wicket Gate, the entry point of the straight and narrow way to the Celestial City. Pilgrims are required to enter by way of the Wicket Gate. Beelzebub&#x27;s castle was built not very far from the Gate.
* House of the Interpreter, a type of spiritual museum to guide the pilgrims to the Celestial City, emblematic of Calvary and the tomb of Christ.
* Hill Difficulty, both the hill and the road up is called &quot;Difficulty&quot;; it is flanked by two treacherous byways &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Destruction&quot;. There are three choices: Christian takes &quot;Difficulty&quot; (the right way), and Formalist and Hypocrisy take the two other ways, which prove to be fatal dead ends.
* House Beautiful, a palace that serves as a rest stop for pilgrims to the Celestial City. It apparently sits atop the Hill Difficulty. From the House Beautiful one can see forward to the Delectable Mountains. It represents the Christian congregation, and Bunyan takes its name from a gate of the Second Temple (Acts 3:2, 10).
* Valley of Humiliation, the Valley on the other side of the Hill Difficulty, going down into which is said to be extremely slippery by the House Beautiful&#x27;s damsel Prudence. It is where Christian, protected by God&#x27;s Armor, meets Apollyon and they had that dreadful, long fight where Christian was victorious over his enemy by impaling Apollyon on his Sword of the Spirit (Word of God) which caused the Foul Fiend to fly away. Apollyon met Christian in the place known as &quot;Forgetful Green&quot;. This Valley had been a delight to the &quot;Lord of the Hill&quot;, Jesus Christ, in his &quot;state of humiliation&quot;.
* Valley of the Shadow of Death, a treacherous, devilish Valley filled with demons, dragons, fiends, satyrs, goblins, hobgoblins, monsters, creatures from the bottomless pit, beasts from the mouth of Hell, darkness, terror, and horror with a quicksand bog on one side and a deep chasm/ditch on the other side of the King&#x27;s Highway going through it (cf. Psalm 23).
* Gaius&#x27; Inn, a rest stop in the Second Part of the Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.
* Vanity Fair, a city through which the King&#x27;s Highway passes and the yearlong Fair that is held there.
* Plain Ease, a pleasant area traversed by the pilgrims.
* Hill Lucre, location of a reputed silver mine that proves to be the place where By-Ends and his companions are lost. &quot;Lucre&quot; is a term denoting wealth.
* The Pillar of Salt, which was Lot&#x27;s wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt when Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed. The pilgrim&#x27;s note that its location near the Hill Lucre is a fitting warning to those who are tempted by Demas to go into the Lucre silver mine.
* River of God or River of the Water of Life, a place of solace for the pilgrims. It flows through a meadow, green all year long and filled with lush fruit trees. In the Second Part the Good Shepherd is found there to whom Christiana&#x27;s grandchildren are entrusted.
* By-Path Meadow, the place leading to the grounds of Doubting Castle.
* Doubting Castle, the home of Giant Despair and his Giantess wife, Diffidence; only one key could open its doors and gates, the key Promise.
* The Delectable Mountains, known as &quot;Immanuel&#x27;s Land&quot;. Lush country from whose heights one can see many delights and curiosities. It is inhabited by sheep and their shepherds, and from Mount Clear one can see the Celestial City.
* The Enchanted Ground, an area through which the King&#x27;s Highway passes that has air that makes pilgrims want to stop to sleep. If one goes to sleep in this place, one never wakes up. The shepherds of the Delectable Mountains warn pilgrims about this.
* The Land of Beulah, a lush garden area just this side of the River of Death.
* The River of Death, the dreadful river that surrounds Mount Zion, deeper or shallower depending on the faith of the one traversing it.
* The Celestial City, the &quot;Desired Country&quot; of pilgrims, heaven, the dwelling place of the &quot;Lord of the Hill&quot;, God. It is situated on Mount Zion.

== Geographical and topographical features behind the fictional places ==
Scholars have pointed out that Bunyan may have been influenced in the creation of places in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; by his own surrounding environment. Albert Foster describes the natural features of Bedfordshire that apparently turn up in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;. Vera Brittain in her thoroughly researched biography of Bunyan, identifies seven locations that appear in the allegory. Other connections are suggested in books not directly associated with either John Bunyan or &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

At least twenty-one natural or man-made geographical or topographical features from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; have been identified—places and structures John Bunyan regularly would have seen as a child and, later, in his travels on foot or horseback. The entire journey from The City of Destruction to the Celestial City may have been based on Bunyan&#x27;s own usual journey from Bedford, on the main road that runs less than a mile behind his cottage in Elstow, through Ampthill, Dunstable and St Albans, to London.

In the same sequence as these subjects appear in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the geographical realities are as follows:

# The plain (across which Christian fled) is Bedford Plain, which is 15 miles (about 24 km) wide, with the town of Bedford in the middle and the River Great Ouse meandering through the northern half;
# The &quot;Slough of Despond&quot; (a major obstacle for Christian and Pliable: &quot;a very miry slough&quot;) is the large deposits of gray clay, which supplied London Brick&#x27;s works in Stewartby, which was closed in 2008. On either side of the Bedford to Ampthill road these deposits match Bunyan&#x27;s description exactly. Presumably, the road was built on the &quot;twenty thousand cart loads&quot; of fill mentioned in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;; However, the area beside Elstow brook, where John grew up, may also have been an early inspiration – on the north side of this brook, either side of the path to Elstow was (and still is) boggy and John would have known to avoid straying off the main path.
# &quot;Mount Sinai&quot;, the high hill on the way to the village of Morality, whose side &quot;that was next the wayside, did hang so much over&quot;, is the red sandy cliffs just north of Ridgmont (i.e. &quot;Rouge Mont&quot;);
# The &quot;Wicket Gate&quot; could be the wooden gate at the entrance to the Elstow parish church or the wicket gate (small door) in the northern wooden entrance door at the west end of Elstow Abbey Church.
# The castle, from which arrows were shot at those who would enter the Wicket Gate, could be the stand-alone belltower, beside Elstow Abbey church.
# The &quot;House of the Interpreter&quot; is the rectory of St John&#x27;s church in the south side of Bedford, where Bunyan was mentored by the pastor John Gifford;
# The wall &quot;Salvation&quot; that fenced in the King&#x27;s Highway coming after the House of the Interpreter is the red brick wall, over four miles long, beside the Ridgmont to Woburn road, marking the boundary of the Duke of Bedford&#x27;s estate;
# The &quot;place somewhat ascending ... [with] a cross ... and a sepulchre&quot; is the village cross and well that stands by the church at opposite ends of the sloping main street of Stevington, a small village five miles west of Bedford. Bunyan would often preach in a wood by the River Ouse just outside the village.
# The &quot;Hill Difficulty&quot; is Ampthill Hill, on the main Bedford road, the steepest hill in the county. A sandy range of hills stretches across Bedfordshire from Woburn through Ampthill to Potton. These hills are characterized by dark, dense and dismal woods reminiscent of the byways &quot;Danger&quot; and &quot;Destruction&quot;, the alternatives to the way &quot;Difficulty&quot; that goes up the hill;
# The pleasant arbour on the way up the Hill Difficulty is a small &quot;lay-by&quot;, part way up Ampthill Hill, on the east side. A photo, taken in 1908, shows a cyclist resting there;
# The &quot;very narrow passage&quot; to the &quot;Palace Beautiful&quot; is an entrance cut into the high bank by the roadside to the east at the top of Ampthill Hill;
# The &quot;Palace Beautiful&quot; is Houghton (formerly Ampthill) House, built in 1621 but a ruin since 1800. The house faced north; and, because of the dramatic view over the Bedford plain, it was a popular picnic site during the first half of the twentieth century when many families could not travel far afield; The entrance on the south side looks out over the town of Ampthill and towards the Chilterns, the model of &quot;The Delectable Mountains&quot;. There was another source of inspiration; as a young boy, Bunyan would have seen, and been impressed by, Elstow Place — a grand mansion behind Elstow Church, built for Sir Thomas Hillersden from the cloister buildings of Elstow Abbey.
# The &quot;Valley of the Shadow of Death&quot; is Millbrook gorge to the west of Ampthill;
# &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; is probably also drawn from a number of sources. Some argue that local fairs in Elstow, Bedford and Ampthill were too small to fit Bunyan&#x27;s description but Elstow&#x27;s May fairs are known to have been large and rowdy and would certainly have made a big impression on the young Bunyan. Stourbridge Fair, held in Cambridge during late August and early September fits John Bunyan&#x27;s account of the fair&#x27;s antiquity and its vast variety of goods sold and sermons were preached each Sunday during Stourbridge Fair in an area called the &quot;Dodderey&quot;. John Bunyan preached often in Toft, just four miles west of Cambridge, and there is a place known as &quot;Bunyan&#x27;s Barn&quot; in Toft, so it is surmised that Bunyan visited the notable Stourbridge Fair;
# The &quot;pillar of salt&quot;, Lot&#x27;s wife, is a weather-beaten statue that looks much like a person-sized salt pillar. It is on small island in the River Ouse just north of Turvey bridge, eight miles west of Bedford near Stevington;
# The &quot;River of the Water of Life&quot;, with trees along each bank is the River Ouse east of Bedford, where John Bunyan as a boy would fish with his sister Margaret. It might also be the valley of the river Flit, flowing through Flitton and Flitwick south of Ampthill;
# &quot;Doubting Castle&quot; is Ampthill Castle, built in the early 15th century and often visited by King Henry VIII as a hunting lodge. Henry, corpulent and dour, may have been considered by Bunyan to be a model for Giant Despair. Amphill Castle was used for the &quot;house arrest&quot; of Queen Catherine of Aragon and her retinue in 1535–36 before she was taken to Kimbolton. The castle was dismantled soon after 1660, so Bunyan could have seen its towers in the 1650s and known of the empty castle plateau in the 1670s. Giant Despair was killed and Doubting Castle was demolished in the second part of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.
# The &quot;Delectable Mountains&quot; are the Chiltern Hills that can be seen from the second floor of Houghton House. &quot;Chalk hills, stretching fifty miles from the Thames to Dunstable Downs, have beautiful blue flowers and butterflies, with glorious beech trees.&quot; Reminiscent of the possibility of seeing the Celestial City from Mount Clear, on a clear day one can see London&#x27;s buildings from Dunstable Downs near Whipsnade Zoo;
# The &quot;Land of Beulah&quot; is Middlesex county north and west of London, which then (over 150 years before modern suburban sprawl started) had pretty villages, market gardens, and estates containing beautiful parks and gardens): &quot;woods of Islington to the green hills of Hampstead &amp; Highgate&quot;;
# The &quot;very deep river&quot; is the Thames, one thousand feet (300 m) wide at high tide; however, here Bunyan varied from geographical reality and put the city south of the river, and without a bridge.
# The &quot;Celestial City&quot; is the City of London, the physical centre of John Bunyan&#x27;s world—most of his neighbours never travelled that far. In the 1670s, after the Great Fire of 1666, London sported a new gleaming city centre with forty Wren churches. In the last decade of Bunyan&#x27;s life (1678–88), some of his best Christian friends lived in London, including a Lord Mayor.

== Cultural influence ==


=== Context in Christendom ===
&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was much more popular than its predecessors. Bunyan&#x27;s plain style breathes life into the abstractions of the anthropomorphized temptations and abstractions that Christian encounters and with whom he converses on his course to Heaven. Samuel Johnson said that &quot;this is the great merit of the book, that the most cultivated man cannot find anything to praise more highly, and the child knows nothing more amusing&quot;. Three years after its publication (1681), it was reprinted in colonial America, and was widely read in the Puritan colonies. The book was often divided into smaller parts or individual episodes that could be made into individual sermons, postcards, or wall charts. During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the Religious Tract Society produced the book into Sunday School prize editions and cheap abridgments. There were also Bunyan inspired jigsaw puzzles, and some followers crafted their landscapes in Bunyan theme parks.

Because of its English Protestant theology, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; shares the then-popular English antipathy toward the Catholic Church. It was published over the years of the Popish Plot (1678–1681) and ten years before the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and it shows the influence of John Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Acts and Monuments&quot;. Bunyan presents a decrepit and harmless giant to confront Christian at the end of the Valley of the Shadow of Death that is explicitly named &quot;Pope&quot;:Now I saw in my Dream, that at the end of this Valley lay blood, bones, ashes, and mangled bodies of men, even of Pilgrims that had gone this way formerly: And while I was musing what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a Cave, where two Giants, &quot;Pope&quot; and &quot;Pagan&quot;, dwelt in old times, by whose Power and Tyranny the Men whose bones, blood ashes, &amp;c. lay there, were cruelly put to death. But by this place &quot;Christian&quot; went without much danger, whereat I somewhat wondered; but I have learnt since, that &quot;Pagan&quot; has been dead many a day; and as for the other, though he be yet alive, he is by reason of age, and also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger dayes, grown so crazy and stiff in his joynts, that he can now do little more than sit in his Caves mouth, grinning at Pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails, because he cannot come at them.

When Christian and Faithful travel through Vanity Fair, Bunyan adds the editorial comment:But as in other &quot;fairs&quot;, some one Commodity is as the chief of all the &quot;fair&quot;, so the Ware of &quot;Rome&quot; and her Merchandize is greatly promoted in &quot;this fair&quot;: Only our &quot;English&quot; Nation, with some others, have taken a dislike thereat.

In the Second Part, while Christiana and her group of pilgrims led by Greatheart stay for some time in Vanity, the city is terrorized by a seven-headed beast which is driven away by Greatheart and other stalwarts. In his endnotes, W. R. Owens notes about the woman that governs the beast: &quot;This woman was believed by Protestants to represent Antichrist, the Church of Rome. In a posthumously published treatise, &quot;Of Antichrist, and his Ruine&quot; (1692), Bunyan gave an extended account of the rise and (shortly expected) fall of Antichrist.&quot;

=== Foreign-language versions ===
&quot;&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; has been translated into 200 languages&quot;, including Dutch in 1681, German in 1703, and Swedish in 1727, as well as over eighty African languages. In 1681, the first North American edition was issued. In addition, there were nine translations in Southeast Asia, twenty four translations in South Asia, and another eleven in Australasia and the Pacific. Beginning in the 1850s, illustrated versions of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; in Chinese were printed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Fuzhou and widely distributed by Protestant missionaries. Hong Xiuquan, the leader of the Christianity-inspired Taiping Rebellion, declared that the book was his favorite reading.

Henry Alfred Krishnapillai&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Ratchanya Yaathrigam&quot; (The Journey of Salvation) is an adaptation of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; in the Tamil language and is considered one of the finest Tamil literary works of the 19th century. &quot;Paradeshi Mokshayathra&quot; by Rev. K. Koshy/Rev. Joseph Peet (1844), and &quot;Sanchariyude Prayanam&quot; (1846) by Rev. C. Muller/Rev. P. Chandran are allegorical translations in Malayalam and are one of the earliest prose works in the language.

In Turkish, translations of the book appeared in Greek script in 1879, and in Armenian script in 1881.

The literal textual meaning of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was also adapted by young converts and missionaries to make sense in different cultural contexts. &quot;For example, Kele Protestants in the Congo omitted the sections that explained original sin&quot; since &quot;this idea was incompatible with their cultural assumptions.&quot; &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was also adapted to be relevant for non-Europeans, by tailoring the story to make sense of their own experiences. Heaven was often a place designed to resemble what they had gone through in life. For example, in the American Southern Black culture, Bunyan was changed to be a black protagonist who &quot;was redeemed not only from sin but also slavery.&quot; Similarly, a version was written where the injustices which took place in South Africa were reformulated.

There are collections of old foreign language versions of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; at both the Moot Hall Museum in Elstow, and at the John Bunyan Museum in Mill Street in Bedford.

=== The &quot;Third Part&quot; ===
&quot;The Third Part of the Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was written by an anonymous author; beginning in 1693, it was published with Bunyan&#x27;s authentic two parts. It continued to be republished with Bunyan&#x27;s work until 1852. This third part presented the pilgrimage of Tender-Conscience and his companions.

=== Dramatic and musical settings ===
The book was the basis of a condensed radio adaptation, originally presented in 1942 and starring John Gielgud, which included, as background music, several excerpts from Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27; orchestral works.

The book was the basis of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (opera) by Vaughan Williams, premiered in 1951.

The radio version was newly recorded by Hyperion Records in 1990, in a performance conducted by Matthew Best. It again starred Gielgud, and featured Richard Pasco and Ursula Howells.

English composer Ernest Austin set the whole story as a huge narrative tone poem for solo organ, with optional 6-part choir and narrator, lasting approximately hours.

Under the name &quot;The Similitude of a Dream&quot;, the progressive rock band of Neal Morse released a concept album based on &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; in November 2016. A sequel, entitled The Great Adventure, focusing on Christian&#x27;s son Joseph, was released in January 2019. Both albums received critical acclaim.

=== Art and poetry ===
A number of illustrations created by Henry Melville appear in the Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Books under the editorship of Letitia Elizabeth Landon. Each is accompanied by a poem, either by Bernard Barton or by Miss Landon herself. These plates are as follows:
* 1835
** (L. E. L.)
** Christian and Hopeful Escaping from the Doubting Castle (Bernard Barton)
** Christian Got up at the Gate (Bernard Barton)
** The Shepherd Boy in the Valley of Humiliation as (L. E. L.)
* 1836
** The Pilgrims (Bernard Barton)
** The Land of Beulah (Bernard Barton)
** Destruction of the Doubting Castle (Bernard Barton)
** (L. E. L.)
* 1837

&quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was a favourite subject among painters in 1840s America, including major figures of the Hudson River School and others associated with the National Academy of Design. Daniel Huntington, Jasper Cropsey, Frederic Edwin Church, Jesse Talbot, Edward Harrison May, and others completed canvases based on the work. Thomas Cole&#x27;s &quot;The Voyage of Life&quot; was inspired by &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress.&quot;

In 1850, Huntington, Cropsey, and Church contributed designs to a moving panorama based on &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, conceptualized by May and fellow artist Joseph Kyle, which debuted in New York and travelled all over the country. A second version of the panorama, organized by Kyle and artist Jacob Dallas, premiered in 1851. The second version exists today in the collections of the Saco Museum.

=== References in literature ===
In Wole Soyinka&#x27;s novel &quot;Chronicles from the Land of the Happiest People on Earth&quot; (2021), the third chapter is entitled &#x27;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&#x27;. In describes the travels of the character Dennis Tibidje. He encounters John Bunyan&#x27;s book &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; while detained as an illegal immigrant in New Jersey. 
Charles Dickens&#x27; book &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1838) is subtitled &#x27;The Parish Boy&#x27;s Progress&#x27;. The titular character of &quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby&quot; (1839) and his companion Smike start to read it but are interrupted.

The title of William Makepeace Thackeray&#x27;s 1847–1848 novel &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; alludes to the location in Bunyan&#x27;s work.

Mark Twain gave his 1869 travelogue, &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;, the alternative title &quot;The New Pilgrims&#x27; Progress&quot;. In Twain&#x27;s later work &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, the titular character mentions &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; as he describes the works of literature in the Grangerfords&#x27; library. Twain uses this to satirize the Protestant Southern aristocracy.

E. E. Cummings makes numerous references to it in his prose work, &quot;The Enormous Room&quot;.

Nathaniel Hawthorne&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Celestial Railroad&quot;, recreates Christian&#x27;s journey in Hawthorne&#x27;s time. Progressive thinkers have replaced the footpath by a railroad, and pilgrims may now travel under steam power. The journey is considerably faster, but somewhat more questionable. Hawthorne&#x27;s novel &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; also makes reference to it, by way of the author John Bunyan with a metaphor comparing a main character&#x27;s eyes with the fire depicted in the entrance to Hell in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

John Buchan was an admirer of Bunyan&#x27;s, and &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; features significantly in his third Richard Hannay novel, &quot;Mr. Standfast&quot;, which also takes its title from one of Bunyan&#x27;s characters.

Alan Moore, in his &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;, enlists &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; protagonist, Christian, as a member of the earliest version of this group, &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Men&quot;, having become wayward on his journey during his visit in Vanity Fair, stepping down an alleyway and found himself in London in the 1670s, and unable to return to his homeland. This group disbanded in 1690 after Prospero vanished into the Blazing World; however, some parts of the text seem to imply that Christian resigned from Prospero&#x27;s League before its disbanding and that Christian travelled to the Blazing World before Prospero himself. The apparent implication is that; within the context of the League stories; the Celestial City Christian seeks and the Blazing World may in fact be one and the same.

In Louisa May Alcott&#x27;s &quot;Little Women&quot;, the protagonist Jo and her sisters read it at the outset of the novel, and try to follow the good example of Bunyan&#x27;s Christian. Throughout the novel, the main characters refer many times to &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and liken the events in their own lives to the experiences of the pilgrims. A number of chapter titles directly reference characters and places from &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

The cartoonist Winsor McCay drew an allegorical comic strip, entitled &quot;A Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, in the &quot;New York Evening Telegram&quot;. The strip ran from 26 June 1905 to 18 December 1910. In it, the protagonist Mr. Bunion is constantly frustrated in his attempts to improve his life by ridding himself of his burdensome valise, &quot;Dull Care&quot;.

C. S. Lewis wrote a book inspired by &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, called &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Regress&quot;, in which a character named John follows a vision to escape from The Landlord, a less friendly version of The Owner in &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Regress&quot;. It is an allegory of C. S. Lewis&#x27; own journey from a religious childhood to a pagan adulthood in which he rediscovers his Christian God.

Henry Williamson&#x27;s &quot;The Patriot&#x27;s Progress&quot; references the title of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and the symbolic nature of John Bunyan&#x27;s work. The protagonist of the semi-autobiographical novel is John Bullock, the quintessential English soldier during World War I.

The character of Billy Pilgrim in Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-5: The Children&#x27;s Crusade&quot; is a clear homage to a similar journey to enlightenment experienced by Christian, although Billy&#x27;s journey leads him to an existential acceptance of life and of a fatalist human condition. Vonnegut&#x27;s parallel to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; is deliberate and evident in Billy&#x27;s surname.

Charlotte Brontë refers to &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; in most of her novels, including &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Shirley&quot;, and &quot;Villette&quot;. Her alterations to the quest-narrative have led to much critical interest, particular with the ending of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;.

Walt Willis and Bob Shaw&#x27;s classic science fiction fan novelette, &quot;The Enchanted Duplicator&quot;, is explicitly modeled on &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and has been repeatedly reprinted over the decades since its first appearance in 1954: in professional publications, in fanzines, and as a monograph.

Enid Blyton wrote &quot;The Land of Far Beyond&quot; (1942) as a children&#x27;s version of &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;.

John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; mentions &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; as one of an (anonymous) character&#x27;s favorite books. Steinbeck&#x27;s novel was itself an allegorical spiritual journey by Tom Joad through America during the Great Depression, and often made Christian allusions to sacrifice and redemption in a world of social injustice.

The book was commonly referenced in African American slave narratives, such as &quot;Running a Thousand Miles for Freedom&quot; by Ellen and William Craft, to emphasize the moral and religious implications of slavery.

Hannah Hurnard&#x27;s novel &quot;Hinds&#x27; Feet on High Places&quot; (1955) uses a similar allegorical structure to &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and takes Bunyan&#x27;s character Much-Afraid as its protagonist.

In Lois McMaster Bujold&#x27;s &quot;The Borders of Infinity&quot; (1989), Miles Vorkosigan uses half a page torn from &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; as a coded message to his fleet to rescue him and 9,000 others from a POW camp.

Sir Walter Scott uses Bunyan&#x27;s tale in chapter 32 of his novel &quot;The Heart of Midlothian&quot; (1818) to illustrate the relationship between Madge Wildfire and Jeanie Deans. Madge explains: &quot;But it is all over now.—But we&#x27;ll knock at the gate and then the keeper will admit Christiana, but Mercy will be left out—and then I&#x27;ll stand at the door trembling and crying, and then Christiana—that&#x27;s you, Jeanie,—will intercede for me. And then Mercy,—that&#x27;s me, ye ken,—will faint[.]&quot;

In Marguerite Young&#x27;s novel, &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot;, the titular character always carries a copy of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; with her. The structure of the novel is inspired by &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; too, being composed largely of the narrator&#x27;s seemingly omniscient reminiscences about other characters&#x27; inner lives and dreams.

In George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, a lengthy quotation from the conclusion of the trial of Faithful in Vanity Fair serves as the epigraph to Chapter 85.

== Dramatizations, music, and film ==

* In 1850, a moving panorama of &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, known as the &quot;Bunyan Tableuax&quot; or the &quot;Grand Moving Panorama of Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; was painted by Joseph Kyle and Edward Harrison May and displayed in New York; an early copy of this panorama survives and is at the Saco Museum in Maine.
* The novel was made into a film, &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, in 1912.
* In 1950 an hour-long animated version was made by Baptista Films. This version was edited down to 35 minutes and re-released with new music in 1978. As of 2007 the original version is difficult to find, but the 1978 version has been released on both VHS and DVD.

The show moved to Johannesburg in March 1980 and ran for a further three months at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. After a substantial re-write &quot;Christian!&quot; was again mounted at the new Playhouse in Durban for the 1984 Christmas season. The musical has been performed many times since by schools and amateur theatrical groups in South Africa. After 30 years the show is again attracting attention both locally and abroad and the score and libretto are being updated and made more flexible for large and small productions.

A studio recording was also produced and distributed.
* In 1994, &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; and the imprisonment of John Bunyan were the subject of the musical &quot;Celestial City&quot; by David MacAdam, with John Curtis, and an album was released in 1997.

<doc id="173977" wikidata="Q936434" url="?curid=173977" title="Symplectic group">
<text>In mathematics, the name symplectic group can refer to two different, but closely related, collections of mathematical groups, denoted and for positive integer &quot;n&quot; and field F (usually C or R). The latter is called the compact symplectic group and is also denoted by formula_1. Many authors prefer slightly different notations, usually differing by factors of . The notation used here is consistent with the size of the most common matrices which represent the groups. In Cartan&#x27;s classification of the simple Lie algebras, the Lie algebra of the complex group is denoted , and is the compact real form of . Note that when we refer to &quot;the&quot; (compact) symplectic group it is implied that we are talking about the collection of (compact) symplectic groups, indexed by their dimension .

The name &quot;symplectic group&quot; was coined by Hermann Weyl as a replacement for the previous confusing names (line) complex group and Abelian linear group, and is the Greek analog of &quot;complex&quot;.

The metaplectic group is a double cover of the symplectic group over R; it has analogues over other local fields, finite fields, and adele rings.
The symplectic group is a classical group defined as the set of linear transformations of a -dimensional vector space over the field which preserve a non-degenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. Such a vector space is called a symplectic vector space, and the symplectic group of an abstract symplectic vector space is denoted . Upon fixing a basis for , the symplectic group becomes the group of symplectic matrices, with entries in , under the operation of matrix multiplication. This group is denoted either or . If the bilinear form is represented by the nonsingular skew-symmetric matrix Ω, then

:formula_2

where &quot;M&quot;T is the transpose of &quot;M&quot;. Often Ω is defined to be

:formula_3

where &quot;In&quot; is the identity matrix. In this case, can be expressed as those block matrices formula_4, where formula_5, satisfying the three equations:

:formula_6

Since all symplectic matrices have determinant , the symplectic group is a subgroup of the special linear group . When , the symplectic condition on a matrix is satisfied if and only if the determinant is one, so that . For , there are additional conditions, i.e. is then a proper subgroup of .

Typically, the field is the field of real numbers or complex numbers . In these cases is a real or complex Lie group of real or complex dimension , respectively. These groups are connected but non-compact.

The center of consists of the matrices and as long as the characteristic of the field is not . Since the center of is discrete and its quotient modulo the center is a simple group, is considered a simple Lie group.

The real rank of the corresponding Lie algebra, and hence of the Lie group , is .

The Lie algebra of is the set

:formula_7

equipped with the commutator as its Lie bracket. For the standard skew-symmetric bilinear form formula_8, this Lie algebra is the set of all block matrices formula_4 subject to the conditions

:formula_10
The symplectic group over the field of complex numbers is a non-compact, simply connected, simple Lie group. The definition of this group includes no conjugates (contrary to what one might naively expect) but instead it is exactly the same as the definition bar the field change. 
 is the complexification of the real group . is a real, non-compact, connected, simple Lie group. It has a fundamental group isomorphic to the group of integers under addition. As the real form of a simple Lie group its Lie algebra is a splittable Lie algebra.

Some further properties of :

* The exponential map from the Lie algebra to the group is not surjective. However, any element of the group can be represented as the product of two exponentials. In other words,
::formula_11

* For all in :
::formula_12
:The matrix is positive-definite and diagonal. The set of such s forms a non-compact subgroup of whereas forms a compact subgroup. This decomposition is known as &#x27;Euler&#x27; or &#x27;Bloch–Messiah&#x27; decomposition. Further symplectic matrix properties can be found on that Wikipedia page.

* As a Lie group, has a manifold structure. The manifold for is diffeomorphic to the Cartesian product of the unitary group with a vector space of dimension .

===Infinitesimal generators===
The members of the symplectic Lie algebra are the Hamiltonian matrices.

These are matrices, formula_13 such thatformula_14where and are symmetric matrices. See classical group for a derivation.

===Example of symplectic matrices===
For , the group of matrices with determinant , the three symplectic -matrices are:formula_15

==== Sp(2n, R) ====
It turns out that formula_16 can have a fairly explicit description using generators. If we let formula_17 denote the symmetric formula_18 matrices, then formula_16 is generated by formula_20 whereformula_21are subgroups of formula_16pg 173pg 2.

===Relationship with symplectic geometry===
Symplectic geometry is the study of symplectic manifolds. The tangent space at any point on a symplectic manifold is a symplectic vector space. As noted earlier, structure preserving transformations of a symplectic vector space form a group and this group is , depending on the dimension of the space and the field over which it is defined.

A symplectic vector space is itself a symplectic manifold. A transformation under an action of the symplectic group is thus, in a sense, a linearised version of a symplectomorphism which is a more general structure preserving transformation on a symplectic manifold.

The compact symplectic group is the intersection of with the formula_23 unitary group:

:formula_24

It is sometimes written as . Alternatively, can be described as the subgroup of (invertible quaternionic matrices) that preserves the standard hermitian form on :

:formula_25

That is, is just the quaternionic unitary group, . Indeed, it is sometimes called the hyperunitary group. Also Sp(1) is the group of quaternions of norm , equivalent to and topologically a -sphere .

Note that is &quot;not&quot; a symplectic group in the sense of the previous section—it does not preserve a non-degenerate skew-symmetric -bilinear form on : there is no such form except the zero form. Rather, it is isomorphic to a subgroup of , and so does preserve a complex symplectic form in a vector space of twice the dimension. As explained below, the Lie algebra of is the compact real form of the complex symplectic Lie algebra .

 is a real Lie group with (real) dimension . It is compact and simply connected.

The Lie algebra of is given by the quaternionic skew-Hermitian matrices, the set of quaternionic matrices that satisfy

:formula_26

where is the conjugate transpose of (here one takes the quaternionic conjugate). The Lie bracket is given by the commutator.

===Important subgroups===
Some main subgroups are:

: formula_27
: formula_28
: formula_29

Conversely it is itself a subgroup of some other groups:

: formula_30
: formula_31
: formula_32

There are also the isomorphisms of the Lie algebras and .

==Relationship between the symplectic groups==
Every complex, semisimple Lie algebra has a split real form and a compact real form; the former is called a complexification of the latter two.

The Lie algebra of is semisimple and is denoted . Its split real form is and its compact real form is . These correspond to the Lie groups and respectively.

The algebras, , which are the Lie algebras of , are the indefinite signature equivalent to the compact form.

==Physical significance==
===Classical mechanics===
The non-compact symplectic group comes up in classical physics as the symmetries of canonical coordinates preserving the Poisson bracket.

Consider a system of particles, evolving under Hamilton&#x27;s equations whose position in phase space at a given time is denoted by the vector of canonical coordinates,

:formula_33

The elements of the group are, in a certain sense, canonical transformations on this vector, i.e. they preserve the form of Hamilton&#x27;s equations. If

:formula_34

are new canonical coordinates, then, with a dot denoting time derivative,

:formula_35

where

:formula_36

for all and all in phase space.

For the special case of a Riemannian manifold, Hamilton&#x27;s equations describe the geodesics on that manifold. The coordinates formula_37 live on the underlying manifold, and the momenta formula_38 live in the cotangent bundle. This is the reason why these are conventionally written with upper and lower indexes; it is to distinguish their locations. The corresponding Hamiltonian consists purely of the kinetic energy: it is formula_39 where formula_40 is the inverse of the metric tensor formula_41 on the Riemannian manifold. In fact, the cotangent bundle of &quot;any&quot; smooth manifold can be a given a symplectic structure in a canonical way, with the symplectic form defined as the exterior derivative of the tautological one-form.

===Quantum mechanics===

Consider a system of particles whose quantum state encodes its position and momentum. These coordinates are continuous variables and hence the Hilbert space, in which the state lives, is infinite-dimensional. This often makes the analysis of this situation tricky. An alternative approach is to consider the evolution of the position and momentum operators under the Heisenberg equation in phase space.

Construct a vector of canonical coordinates,

:formula_42

The canonical commutation relation can be expressed simply as

:formula_43

where

:formula_44

and is the identity matrix.

Many physical situations only require quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e. Hamiltonians of the form

:formula_45

where is a real, symmetric matrix. This turns out to be a useful restriction and allows us to rewrite the Heisenberg equation as

:formula_46

The solution to this equation must preserve the canonical commutation relation. It can be shown that the time evolution of this system is equivalent to an action of the real symplectic group,, on the phase space.

<text>In probability theory and statistics, two real-valued random variables, formula_1, formula_2, are said to be uncorrelated if their covariance, formula_3, is zero. If two variables are uncorrelated, there is no linear relationship between them.

Uncorrelated random variables have a Pearson correlation coefficient, when it exists, of zero, except in the trivial case when either variable has zero variance (is a constant). In this case the correlation is undefined.

In general, uncorrelatedness is not the same as orthogonality, except in the special case where at least one of the two random variables has an expected value of 0. In this case, the covariance is the expectation of the product, and formula_1 and formula_2 are uncorrelated if and only if formula_6.

If formula_1 and formula_2 are independent, with finite second moments, then they are uncorrelated. However, not all uncorrelated variables are independent.

==Definition==
===Definition for two real random variables===
Two random variables formula_9 are called uncorrelated if their covariance formula_10 is zero. Formally:

===Definition for two complex random variables===
Two complex random variables formula_11 are called uncorrelated if their covariance formula_12 and their pseudo-covariance formula_13 is zero, i.e.

formula_14

===Definition for more than two random variables===
A set of two or more random variables formula_15 is called uncorrelated if each pair of them is uncorrelated. This is equivalent to the requirement that the non-diagonal elements of the autocovariance matrix formula_16 of the random vector formula_17 are all zero. The autocovariance matrix is defined as:
:formula_18

==Examples of dependence without correlation ==
===Example 1===
* Let formula_1 be a random variable that takes the value 0 with probability 1/2, and takes the value 1 with probability 1/2.
* Let formula_2 be a random variable, &quot;independent&quot; of formula_1, that takes the value −1 with probability 1/2, and takes the value 1 with probability 1/2.
* Let formula_22 be a random variable constructed as formula_23.
The claim is that formula_22 and formula_1 have zero covariance (and thus are uncorrelated), but are not independent.

Proof:

Taking into account that
:formula_26
where the second equality holds because formula_1 and formula_2 are independent, one gets
:formula_29

Therefore, formula_22 and formula_1 are uncorrelated.

Independence of formula_22 and formula_1 means that for all formula_34 and formula_35, formula_36. This is not true, in particular, for formula_37 and formula_38.
* formula_39
* formula_40
Thus formula_41 so formula_22 and formula_1 are not independent.

Q.E.D.

===Example 2===
If formula_1 is a continuous random variable uniformly distributed on formula_45 and formula_46, then formula_1 and formula_2 are uncorrelated even though formula_1 determines formula_2 and a particular value of formula_2 can be produced by only one or two values of formula_1 :

formula_53

on the other hand, formula_54 is 0 on the triangle defined by formula_55 although formula_56 is not null on this domain. 
Therefore formula_57 and the variables are not independent.

formula_58
where
:formula_59
and
:formula_60.

===Uncorrelated stochastic processes===
Two stochastic processes formula_61 and formula_62 are called uncorrelated if their cross-covariance formula_63 is zero for all times. Formally:

:formula_64.

<doc id="173983" wikidata="Q2705070" url="?curid=173983" title="Symplectic matrix">
<text>In mathematics, a symplectic matrix is a formula_1 matrix formula_2 with real entries that satisfies the condition

where formula_3 denotes the transpose of formula_2 and formula_5 is a fixed formula_1 nonsingular, skew-symmetric matrix. This definition can be extended to formula_1 matrices with entries in other fields, such as the complex numbers, finite fields, &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers, and function fields.

Typically formula_5 is chosen to be the block matrix
formula_9
where formula_10 is the formula_11 identity matrix. The matrix formula_5 has determinant formula_13 and its inverse is formula_14.

==Properties==

=== Generators for symplectic matrices ===
Every symplectic matrix has determinant formula_13, and the formula_1 symplectic matrices with real entries form a subgroup of the general linear group formula_17 under matrix multiplication since being symplectic is a property stable under matrix multiplication. Topologically, this symplectic group is a connected noncompact real Lie group of real dimension formula_18, and is denoted formula_19. The symplectic group can be defined as the set of linear transformations that preserve the symplectic form of a real symplectic vector space.

This symplectic group has a distinguished set of generators, which can be used to find all possible symplectic matrices. This includes the following sets
formula_20
where formula_21 is the set of formula_11 symmetric matrices. Then, formula_19 is generated by the setp. 2
formula_24
of matrices. In other words, any symplectic matrix can be constructed by multiplying matrices in formula_25 and formula_26 together, along with some power of formula_5.

=== Inverse matrix ===
Every symplectic matrix is invertible with the inverse matrix given by
formula_28
Furthermore, the product of two symplectic matrices is, again, a symplectic matrix. This gives the set of all symplectic matrices the structure of a group. There exists a natural manifold structure on this group which makes it into a (real or complex) Lie group called the symplectic group.

=== Determinantal properties ===
It follows easily from the definition that the determinant of any symplectic matrix is ±1. Actually, it turns out that the determinant is always +1 for any field. One way to see this is through the use of the Pfaffian and the identity
formula_29
Since formula_30 and formula_31 we have that formula_32.

When the underlying field is real or complex, one can also show this by factoring the inequality formula_33.

=== Block form of symplectic matrices ===
Suppose Ω is given in the standard form and let formula_2 be a formula_1 block matrix given by
formula_36
where formula_37 are formula_11 matrices. The condition for formula_2 to be symplectic is equivalent to the two following equivalent conditionsformula_40 symmetric, and formula_41formula_42 symmetric, and formula_43The second condition comes from the fact that if formula_2 is symplectic, then formula_45 is also symplectic. When formula_46 these conditions reduce to the single condition formula_32. Thus a formula_48 matrix is symplectic iff it has unit determinant.

==== Inverse matrix of block matrix ====
With formula_5 in standard form, the inverse of formula_2 is given by
formula_51
The group has dimension formula_18. This can be seen by noting that formula_53 is anti-symmetric. Since the space of anti-symmetric matrices has dimension formula_54 the identity formula_55 imposes formula_56 constraints on the formula_57 coefficients of formula_2 and leaves formula_2 with formula_18 independent coefficients.

==Symplectic transformations==

In the abstract formulation of linear algebra, matrices are replaced with linear transformations of finite-dimensional vector spaces. The abstract analog of a symplectic matrix is a symplectic transformation of a symplectic vector space. Briefly, a symplectic vector space formula_61 is a formula_62-dimensional vector space formula_63 equipped with a nondegenerate, skew-symmetric bilinear form formula_64 called the symplectic form.

A symplectic transformation is then a linear transformation formula_65 which preserves formula_64, i.e.
:formula_67
Fixing a basis for formula_63, formula_64 can be written as a matrix formula_5 and formula_71 as a matrix formula_2. The condition that formula_71 be a symplectic transformation is precisely the condition that &quot;M&quot; be a symplectic matrix:
:formula_74

Under a change of basis, represented by a matrix &quot;A&quot;, we have
:formula_75
:formula_76
One can always bring formula_5 to either the standard form given in the introduction or the block diagonal form described below by a suitable choice of &quot;A&quot;.

==The matrix Ω==
Symplectic matrices are defined relative to a fixed nonsingular, skew-symmetric matrix formula_5. As explained in the previous section, formula_5 can be thought of as the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. It is a basic result in linear algebra that any two such matrices differ from each other by a change of basis.

The most common alternative to the standard formula_5 given above is the block diagonal form
:formula_81
This choice differs from the previous one by a permutation of basis vectors.

Sometimes the notation formula_82 is used instead of formula_5 for the skew-symmetric matrix. This is a particularly unfortunate choice as it leads to confusion with the notion of a complex structure, which often has the same coordinate expression as formula_5 but represents a very different structure. A complex structure formula_82 is the coordinate representation of a linear transformation that squares to formula_86, whereas formula_5 is the coordinate representation of a nondegenerate skew-symmetric bilinear form. One could easily choose bases in which formula_82 is not skew-symmetric or formula_5 does not square to formula_86.

Given a hermitian structure on a vector space, formula_82 and formula_5 are related via
:formula_93
where formula_94 is the metric. That formula_82 and formula_5 usually have the same coordinate expression (up to an overall sign) is simply a consequence of the fact that the metric &quot;g&quot; is usually the identity matrix.

==Diagonalization and decomposition==
*For any positive definite symmetric formula_1 real symplectic matrix formula_98, there is a symplectic unitary formula_99, formula_100such thatformula_101where the diagonal elements of formula_102 are the eigenvalues of formula_98.

*Any real symplectic matrix has a polar decomposition of the form:formula_104whereformula_105 andformula_106

*Any real symplectic matrix can be decomposed as a product of three matrices:formula_107where formula_108 and formula_109 are both symplectic and orthogonal, and formula_102 is positive-definite and diagonal. This decomposition is closely related to the singular value decomposition of a matrix and is known as an &#x27;Euler&#x27; or &#x27;Bloch-Messiah&#x27; decomposition.

* The set of orthogonal symplectic matrices forms a (maximal) compact subgroup of the symplectic group. This set is isomorphic to the set of unitary matrices of dimension formula_111, formula_112. Every symplectic orthogonal matrix can be written as
\begin{pmatrix}
I_n &amp; i I_n \\
I_n &amp; -i I_n
\end{pmatrix} \right]^\dagger \begin{pmatrix}
V &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; V^*
\end{pmatrix} \left[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix}
I_n &amp; i I_n \\
I_n &amp; -i I_n
\end{pmatrix} \right],
&lt;/math&gt;|}}
with formula_113.
This equation implies that every symplectic orthogonal matrix has determinant equal to +1 and thus that this is true for all symplectic matrices as its polar decomposition is itself given in terms symplectic matrices.

==Complex matrices==

If instead &quot;M&quot; is a matrix with complex entries, the definition is not standard throughout the literature. Many authors adjust the definition above to

where &quot;M*&quot; denotes the conjugate transpose of &quot;M&quot;. In this case, the determinant may not be 1, but will have absolute value 1. In the 2×2 case (&quot;n&quot;=1), &quot;M&quot; will be the product of a real symplectic matrix and a complex number of absolute value 1.

Other authors retain the definition () for complex matrices and call matrices satisfying () &quot;conjugate symplectic&quot;.

==Applications==

Transformations described by symplectic matrices play an important role in quantum optics and in continuous-variable quantum information theory. For instance, symplectic matrices can be used to describe Gaussian (Bogoliubov) transformations of a quantum state of light. In turn, the Bloch-Messiah decomposition () means that such an arbitrary Gaussian transformation can be represented as a set of two passive linear-optical interferometers (corresponding to orthogonal matrices &quot;O&quot; and &quot;O&#x27; &quot;) intermitted by a layer of active non-linear squeezing transformations (given in terms of the matrix &quot;D&quot;). In fact, one can circumvent the need for such &quot;in-line&quot; active squeezing transformations if two-mode squeezed vacuum states are available as a prior resource only.

<text>Soft Cell are an English synth-pop duo who came to prominence in the early 1980s. The duo consists of vocalist Marc Almond and instrumentalist David Ball. The band are primarily known for their 1981 hit version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; and their platinum-selling debut album &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, Soft Cell had twelve top 40 hits, including &quot;Tainted Love&quot; (number 1), &quot;Torch&quot; (number 2), &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot;, &quot;What&quot; (both number 3), and &quot;Bedsitter&quot; (number 4). They also had four top 20 albums between 1981 and 1984. The duo split in 1984 but reformed in 2001 to tour and release a new album. They held a reunion concert in London on 30 September 2018, stating it would be their last live UK performance as a duo but that they may still perform abroad and record together.

Soft Cell&#x27;s songs have been covered by several artists, including David Gray, Coil and Nine Inch Nails. Their track &quot;Memorabilia&quot; earned recognition for the band as pioneers of the synth-oriented techno genre. The duo have sold in excess of ten million records world-wide.

==History==
===&quot;Mutant Moments&quot; and &quot;Memorabilia&quot;===

Soft Cell were formed in 1978, after Almond and Ball had met at Leeds Polytechnic in the previous year. Their initial efforts at recording resulted in an EP titled &quot;Mutant Moments&quot;, released in 1980 and which was funded by a loan of £2,000 from Dave Ball&#x27;s mother and made with a simple two-track recorder.

Soft Cell&#x27;s next recording, &quot;The Girl with the Patent Leather Face&quot;, appeared as a contribution to the &quot;Some Bizzare Album&quot;, which included Depeche Mode, the The, and Blancmange. The duo ultimately signed to the Some Bizzare label, backed by Phonogram Records. Their first single, &quot;A Man Could Get Lost&quot; b/w &quot;Memorabilia&quot; on 7&quot; and &quot;Memorabilia&quot; b/w &quot;Persuasion&quot; on 12&quot;, was produced by Daniel Miller who founded Mute Records, &quot;Memorabilia&quot; was a success in nightclubs, but did not enter the UK singles chart.

===&quot;Tainted Love&quot;===

After the chart failure of &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, Phonogram Records allowed Soft Cell to record a second and final single in an attempt to score a chart success. The band opted to record a cover version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot;, an obscure 1965 northern soul track originally released by Gloria Jones (the girlfriend of Marc Bolan at the time of his death) and written by Ed Cobb of the Four Preps.

Released in 1981, Soft Cell&#x27;s &quot;Tainted Love&quot; was a No. 1 hit in 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, where it was the second best selling single of 1981 after selling 1.05 million copies (a total which increased to 1.35 million copies by August 2017).

In 1982, &quot;Tainted Love&quot; became a No. 8 single in the United States and went on to set a Guinness World Record at the time for the longest consecutive stay (43 weeks) on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. The song&#x27;s popularity developed slowly, needing 19 weeks to enter the US Top 40. The A-side of the 12-inch single of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; actually featured a two-song medley, with &quot;Tainted Love&quot; blending into the Motown classic &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; (originally recorded by the Supremes in 1964).

===&quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;===
The duo&#x27;s first album, &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;, hit UK No. 5 and further explored the now-trademark Soft Cell themes of squalor and sleaze. &quot;Seedy Films&quot; talks of long nights in porno cinemas, while &quot;Frustration&quot; and &quot;Secret Life&quot; deal with the boredom and hypocrisy associated with suburban life. A companion video titled &quot;Non-Stop Exotic Video Show&quot; was released in 1982 and featured videos directed by Tim Pope. The video generated some controversy in Britain, mainly due to a scandal involved with the &quot;Sex Dwarf&quot; clip.

&quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot; garnered two additional hits: &quot;Bedsitter&quot; dealt with the loneliness and lifestyle of a young man having recently left home to live in a bedsit while partying hard. &quot;Bedsitter&quot; reached No. 4 in the UK Singles Chart in November 1981. The song was highly acclaimed in a retrospective review by AllMusic journalist Ned Raggett who wrote that it &quot;ranks as one of the best, most realistic portrayals of urban life recorded.&quot; The final single on the album, the ballad &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot;, peaked at No. 3 in February 1982.

During 1982, the duo spent most of their time recording and relaxing in New York City, where they met a woman named Cindy Ecstasy who Almond would later confirm was his drug supplier (it was Cindy Ecstasy who introduced them to the new nightclub drug of the same name). Soon after &quot;Say Hello Wave Goodbye&quot; dropped out of the chart, Soft Cell released a brand new song: &quot;Torch&quot;, a love song which was to prove the closest the band ever got to having a No. 1 hit with one of their own songs. The song entered straight into the Top 20 and peaked at No. 2.

In June 1982, as was the trend at the time, the duo released a mini album titled &quot;Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing&quot;, containing remixes of older material along with their new single, &quot;What!&quot;, which is a cover of the 1965 song by Melinda Marx, which was later covered in 1968 by Judy Street, whose version became extremely popular on the Northern Soul scene.&quot;What!&quot; was a major hit in the UK and reached No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart in August that year.

===Decline and dissolution===

By 1983, fame and nearly constant drug use were having a bad effect on the duo. Marc Almond also formed the group Marc and the Mambas, featuring collaborations with the The&#x27;s Matt Johnson and future Almond collaborator Annie Hogan, as an offshoot to experiment out of the glare of the Soft Cell spotlight. Soft Cell&#x27;s third album release, appropriately titled &quot;The Art of Falling Apart&quot;, was a Top 5 hit in the UK but the singles were only modest successes. The first single &quot;Where The Heart Is&quot; only reached 21, while the double A-side &quot;Numbers&quot;/&quot;Barriers&quot; peaked at 25. &quot;Numbers&quot; also generated controversy due to references in the song to the drug speed.

In September 1983, the duo released a new single &quot;Soul Inside&quot;, which returned them to the UK Top 20, but by early 1984 the duo had amicably decided to end Soft Cell. They played farewell concerts at Hammersmith Palais in January, and released one final album called &quot;This Last Night in Sodom&quot; (UK No. 12) in March. The album&#x27;s second and final single &quot;Down in the Subway&quot; (UK No. 24), had already been released in February 1984.

===Reunions===
Almond and Ball reunited as Soft Cell in 2000 with a series of live dates. They performed at the opening of the Ocean nightclub in London during March 2001. A mini-tour followed later in the year. The track &quot;God Shaped Hole&quot; featured on the Some Bizzare compilation titled &quot;I&#x27;d Rather Shout at a Returning Echo than Kid Someone&#x27;s Listening&quot;, released during 2001. A new Soft Cell album, &quot;Cruelty Without Beauty&quot;, was released during late 2002, followed by a European tour and a small US tour during early 2003. The second single from the album, a cover of the Four Seasons″ &quot;The Night&quot;, reached No. 39 in the UK. Soft Cell had considered recording &quot;The Night&quot; in place of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; during 1981, though keyboardist David Ball stated in a 2003 interview with the BBC, &quot;I think history has kind of shown that we did make the right choice [in 1981]&quot;.

In 2005 they released an album compiling some of their early demo recordings called the Bedsit Tapes. Another similar compilation entitled Demo Non Stop was also released around this time.

In November 2008, the band released a remix album entitled &quot;Heat&quot;. The album included Soft Cell tracks remixed by such acts as Paul Dakeyne, the Grid, Manhattan Clique, Cicada, Richard X, Ladytron, MHC, Atomizer, Mark Moore, Spektrum, The Dark Poets and many more.

In February 2018, Soft Cell announced that they would reunite for one last UK reunion concert. On 21 August 2018, Almond revealed on the Chris Evans Breakfast Show on BBC Radio 2 that Soft Cell were releasing two new tracks ahead of the concert: &quot;Northern Lights&quot; and &quot;Guilty (Cos I Say You Are)&quot;. Entitled &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye&quot;, the reunion concert took place at the O2 Arena in London on 30 September 2018. It was stated this was their final live UK show as a duo, but that they may still perform abroad and record material together.

In 2019 Ball said a new Soft Cell album was in the works. In May 2019, the &quot;To Show You, I&#x27;ve Been There&quot; book was released, which came with a vinyl copy of the &quot;Magick Mutants&quot; EP, a sequel to their debut &quot;Mutant Moments&quot; EP.

In June 2020, the &quot;Mutant Moments&quot; EP received its first official release. Originally to be part of the UK June Record Store Day 2020, the 10 inch EP was sold directly through the band&#x27;s website, as the event was cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In July 2021, the duo announced that their new album would be called &quot;Happiness Not Included&quot; and would feature tracks such as &quot;Heart Like Chernobyl&quot;,
&quot;Light Sleepers&quot; and &quot;Nostalgia Machine&quot;. The album was released in May 2022, 20 years after their previous studio album release, with Dave Ball revealing Pet Shop Boys were working on a remix for a forthcoming single.

Despite claiming their 2018 reunion show would be the last in the UK, Soft Cell reunited again for 5 performances in 2021. The short tour was to mark 40 years of the &quot;Non Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot; album, with the band performing the album in full, as well as some hits and new material. The run began at the O2 Academy in Glasgow, Scotland on 10 November and ended at the London Hammersmith Apollo on 16 November. On 16 September 2023 they opened the BBC Radio 2 &quot;Live in the Park&quot; event in Victoria Park Leicester. 

==Influences==
The group cited David Bowie, Marc Bolan and Suicide as primary influences. Almond also named Siouxsie Sioux as a major influence for his early performance style.

<text>In mathematics, the unitary group of degree &quot;n&quot;, denoted U(&quot;n&quot;), is the group of unitary matrices, with the group operation of matrix multiplication. The unitary group is a subgroup of the general linear group , and it has as a subgroup the special unitary group, consisting of those unitary matrices with determinant 1.

In the simple case , the group U(1) corresponds to the circle group, isomorphic to the set of all complex numbers that have absolute value 1, under multiplication. All the unitary groups contain copies of this group.

The unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) is a real Lie group of dimension &quot;n&quot;2. The Lie algebra of U(&quot;n&quot;) consists of skew-Hermitian matrices, with the Lie bracket given by the commutator.

The general unitary group, also called the group of unitary similitudes, consists of all matrices &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;A&quot;∗&quot;A&quot; is a nonzero multiple of the identity matrix, and is just the product of the unitary group with the group of all positive multiples of the identity matrix.

Unitary groups may also be defined over fields other than the complex numbers. The hyperorthogonal group is an archaic name for the unitary group, especially over finite fields.

== Properties ==
Since the determinant of a unitary matrix is a complex number with norm 1, the determinant gives a group homomorphism
: formula_1

The kernel of this homomorphism is the set of unitary matrices with determinant 1. This subgroup is called the special unitary group, denoted SU(&quot;n&quot;). We then have a short exact sequence of Lie groups:
: formula_2

The above map U(&quot;n&quot;) to U(1) has a section: we can view U(1) as the subgroup of U(&quot;n&quot;) that are diagonal with &quot;eiθ&quot; in the upper left corner and 1 on the rest of the diagonal. Therefore U(&quot;n&quot;) is a semidirect product of U(1) with SU(&quot;n&quot;).

The unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) is not abelian for . The center of U(&quot;n&quot;) is the set of scalar matrices &quot;λI&quot; with ; this follows from Schur&#x27;s lemma. The center is then isomorphic to U(1). Since the center of U(&quot;n&quot;) is a 1-dimensional abelian normal subgroup of U(&quot;n&quot;), the unitary group is not semisimple, but it is reductive.

== Topology ==
The unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) is endowed with the relative topology as a subset of , the set of all complex matrices, which is itself homeomorphic to a 2&quot;n&quot;2-dimensional Euclidean space.

As a topological space, U(&quot;n&quot;) is both compact and connected. To show that U(&quot;n&quot;) is connected, recall that any unitary matrix &quot;A&quot; can be diagonalized by another unitary matrix &quot;S&quot;. Any diagonal unitary matrix must have complex numbers of absolute value 1 on the main diagonal. We can therefore write
: formula_3

A path in U(&quot;n&quot;) from the identity to &quot;A&quot; is then given by
: formula_4

The unitary group is not simply connected; the fundamental group of U(&quot;n&quot;) is infinite cyclic for all &quot;n&quot;:
: formula_5

To see this, note that the above splitting of U(&quot;n&quot;) as a semidirect product of SU(&quot;n&quot;) and U(1) induces a topological product structure on U(&quot;n&quot;), so that
: formula_6

Now the first unitary group U(1) is topologically a circle, which is well known to have a fundamental group isomorphic to Z, whereas SU(&quot;n&quot;) is simply connected.

The determinant map induces an isomorphism of fundamental groups, with the splitting inducing the inverse.

The Weyl group of U(&quot;n&quot;) is the symmetric group S&quot;n&quot;, acting on the diagonal torus by permuting the entries:
: formula_7

== Related groups ==

=== 2-out-of-3 property ===
The unitary group is the 3-fold intersection of the orthogonal, complex, and symplectic groups:
: formula_8

Thus a unitary structure can be seen as an orthogonal structure, a complex structure, and a symplectic structure, which are required to be &quot;compatible&quot; (meaning that one uses the same &quot;J&quot; in the complex structure and the symplectic form, and that this &quot;J&quot; is orthogonal; writing all the groups as matrix groups fixes a &quot;J&quot; (which is orthogonal) and ensures compatibility).

In fact, it is the intersection of any &quot;two&quot; of these three; thus a compatible orthogonal and complex structure induce a symplectic structure, and so forth.

At the level of equations, this can be seen as follows:
: formula_9

Any two of these equations implies the third.

At the level of forms, this can be seen by decomposing a Hermitian form into its real and imaginary parts: the real part is symmetric (orthogonal), and the imaginary part is skew-symmetric (symplectic)—and these are related by the complex structure (which is the compatibility). On an almost Kähler manifold, one can write this decomposition as , where &quot;h&quot; is the Hermitian form, &quot;g&quot; is the Riemannian metric, &quot;i&quot; is the almost complex structure, and &quot;ω&quot; is the almost symplectic structure.

From the point of view of Lie groups, this can partly be explained as follows: O(2&quot;n&quot;) is the maximal compact subgroup of , and U(&quot;n&quot;) is the maximal compact subgroup of both and Sp(2&quot;n&quot;). Thus the intersection or is the maximal compact subgroup of both of these, so U(&quot;n&quot;). From this perspective, what is unexpected is the intersection .

=== Special unitary and projective unitary groups ===

Just as the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;) has the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;) as subgroup and the projective orthogonal group PO(&quot;n&quot;) as quotient, and the projective special orthogonal group PSO(&quot;n&quot;) as subquotient, the unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) has associated to it the special unitary group SU(&quot;n&quot;), the projective unitary group PU(&quot;n&quot;), and the projective special unitary group PSU(&quot;n&quot;). These are related as by the commutative diagram at right; notably, both projective groups are equal: .

The above is for the classical unitary group (over the complex numbers) – for unitary groups over finite fields, one similarly obtains special unitary and projective unitary groups, but in general .

== G-structure: almost Hermitian ==
In the language of G-structures, a manifold with a U(&quot;n&quot;)-structure is an almost Hermitian manifold.

== Generalizations ==
From the point of view of Lie theory, the classical unitary group is a real form of the Steinberg group 2An, which is an algebraic group that arises from the combination of the &quot;diagram automorphism&quot; of the general linear group (reversing the Dynkin diagram A&quot;n&quot;, which corresponds to transpose inverse) and the &quot;field automorphism&quot; of the extension C/R (namely complex conjugation). Both these automorphisms are automorphisms of the algebraic group, have order 2, and commute, and the unitary group is the fixed points of the product automorphism, as an algebraic group. The classical unitary group is a real form of this group, corresponding to the standard Hermitian form Ψ, which is positive definite.

This can be generalized in a number of ways:
* generalizing to other Hermitian forms yields indefinite unitary groups ;
* the field extension can be replaced by any degree 2 separable algebra, most notably a degree 2 extension of a finite field;
* generalizing to other diagrams yields other groups of Lie type, namely the other Steinberg groups 2D&quot;n&quot;, 2E6, 3D4, (in addition to 2A&quot;n&quot;) and Suzuki–Ree groups
*: formula_10
* considering a generalized unitary group as an algebraic group, one can take its points over various algebras.

=== Indefinite forms ===
Analogous to the indefinite orthogonal groups, one can define an indefinite unitary group, by considering the transforms that preserve a given Hermitian form, not necessarily positive definite (but generally taken to be non-degenerate). Here one is working with a vector space over the complex numbers.

Given a Hermitian form Ψ on a complex vector space &quot;V&quot;, the unitary group U(Ψ) is the group of transforms that preserve the form: the transform &quot;M&quot; such that for all . In terms of matrices, representing the form by a matrix denoted Φ, this says that .

Just as for symmetric forms over the reals, Hermitian forms are determined by signature, and are all unitarily congruent to a diagonal form with &quot;p&quot; entries of 1 on the diagonal and &quot;q&quot; entries of −1. The non-degenerate assumption is equivalent to . In a standard basis, this is represented as a quadratic form as:
: formula_11

and as a symmetric form as:
: formula_12

The resulting group is denoted .

=== Finite fields ===
Over the finite field with elements, F&quot;q&quot;, there is a unique quadratic extension field, F&quot;q&quot;2, with order 2 automorphism formula_13 (the &quot;r&quot;th power of the Frobenius automorphism). This allows one to define a Hermitian form on an F&quot;q&quot;2 vector space &quot;V&quot;, as an F&quot;q&quot;-bilinear map formula_14 such that formula_15 and formula_16 for . Further, all non-degenerate Hermitian forms on a vector space over a finite field are unitarily congruent to the standard one, represented by the identity matrix; that is, any Hermitian form is unitarily equivalent to
: formula_17
where formula_18 represent the coordinates of in some particular F&quot;q&quot;2-basis of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space &quot;V&quot; .

Thus one can define a (unique) unitary group of dimension &quot;n&quot; for the extension F&quot;q&quot;2/F&quot;q&quot;, denoted either as or depending on the author. The subgroup of the unitary group consisting of matrices of determinant 1 is called the special unitary group and denoted or . For convenience, this article will use the convention. The center of has order and consists of the scalar matrices that are unitary, that is those matrices &quot;cIV&quot; with formula_19. The center of the special unitary group has order and consists of those unitary scalars which also have order dividing &quot;n&quot;. The quotient of the unitary group by its center is called the projective unitary group, , and the quotient of the special unitary group by its center is the projective special unitary group . In most cases ( and ), is a perfect group and is a finite simple group, .

=== Degree-2 separable algebras ===
More generally, given a field &quot;k&quot; and a degree-2 separable &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;K&quot; (which may be a field extension but need not be), one can define unitary groups with respect to this extension.

First, there is a unique &quot;k&quot;-automorphism of &quot;K&quot; formula_20 which is an involution and fixes exactly &quot;k&quot; (formula_21 if and only if ). This generalizes complex conjugation and the conjugation of degree 2 finite field extensions, and allows one to define Hermitian forms and unitary groups as above.

=== Algebraic groups ===
The equations defining a unitary group are polynomial equations over &quot;k&quot; (but not over &quot;K&quot;): for the standard form , the equations are given in matrices as , where formula_22 is the conjugate transpose. Given a different form, they are . The unitary group is thus an algebraic group, whose points over a &quot;k&quot;-algebra &quot;R&quot; are given by:
: formula_23

For the field extension C/R and the standard (positive definite) Hermitian form, these yield an algebraic group with real and complex points given by:
: formula_24

In fact, the unitary group is a linear algebraic group.

==== Unitary group of a quadratic module ====
The unitary group of a quadratic module is a generalisation of the linear algebraic group U just defined, which incorporates as special cases many different classical algebraic groups. The definition goes back to Anthony Bak&#x27;s thesis.

To define it, one has to define quadratic modules first:

Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring with anti-automorphism &quot;J&quot;, formula_25 such that formula_26 for all &quot;r&quot; in &quot;R&quot; and formula_27. Define
: formula_28

Let be an additive subgroup of &quot;R&quot;, then Λ is called &quot;form parameter&quot; if formula_29 and formula_30. A pair such that &quot;R&quot; is a ring and Λ a form parameter is called &quot;form ring&quot;.

Let &quot;M&quot; be an &quot;R&quot;-module and &quot;f&quot; a &quot;J&quot;-sesquilinear form on &quot;M&quot; (i.e., formula_31 for any formula_32 and formula_33). Define formula_34 and formula_35, then &quot;f&quot; is said to &quot;define&quot; the &quot;Λ-quadratic form&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. A &quot;quadratic module&quot; over is a triple such that &quot;M&quot; is an &quot;R&quot;-module and is a Λ-quadratic form.

To any quadratic module defined by a &quot;J&quot;-sesquilinear form &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot; over a form ring one can associate the &quot;unitary group&quot;
: formula_36

The special case where , with &quot;J&quot; any non-trivial involution (i.e., formula_37 and gives back the &quot;classical&quot; unitary group (as an algebraic group).

== Polynomial invariants ==
The unitary groups are the automorphisms of two polynomials in real non-commutative variables:
: formula_38

These are easily seen to be the real and imaginary parts of the complex form formula_39. The two invariants separately are invariants of O(2&quot;n&quot;) and Sp(2&quot;n&quot;). Combined they make the invariants of U(&quot;n&quot;) which is a subgroup of both these groups. The variables must be non-commutative in these invariants otherwise the second polynomial is identically zero.

== Classifying space ==
The classifying space for U(&quot;n&quot;) is described in the article Classifying space for U(&quot;n&quot;).

<text>Prince Ferdinand Philippe, Duke of Orléans (Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri Joseph; 3 September 1810 – 13 July 1842) was the eldest son of King Louis Philippe I of France and Maria Amalia of Naples and Sicily. He was born in exile in his mother&#x27;s native Sicily while his parents were the Duke and Duchess of Orléans. Ferdinand Philippe was heir to the House of Orléans from birth. Following his father&#x27;s succession as King of the French in 1830, he became the Prince Royal of France and Duke of Orléans. He died in 1842, never to succeed his father or see the collapse of the July Monarchy and subsequent exile of his family to the United Kingdom.

==Early life==
Born in Palermo in September 1810, during his parents&#x27; exile, he was given the title Duke of Chartres (and was called &quot;Chartres&quot; within the family circle). He was baptised &quot;Ferdinand Philippe Louis Charles Henri Joseph&quot; and known as Ferdinand Philippe in honour of his grandfathers, Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and Philippe Égalité. Despite having been born in exile, he held the rank of prince of the blood and was styled &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. As the eldest son, he was the heir to the title of Duke of Orléans, head of the House of Orléans (a cadet branch of the Bourbons of France descended from the only brother of Louis XIV).

The young prince first visited France in 1814 during the First Restoration, settling there more permanently in 1817. In 1819 his father put him in the care of a tutor, M. de Boismilon, at the Collège Henri-IV. Louis Philippe wished his son to receive a liberal education on a foundation of complete equality with his fellow students. Ferdinand Philippe was highly successful in his studies and took courses at the École polytechnique. After a trip to Great Britain (visiting both England and Scotland) in 1819, he went to Lunéville to join the 1er régiment de hussards, of which he was made colonel by Charles X in 1824. In September 1824, King Charles X granted him the style &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, a style maintained by Ferdinand Philippe at his father&#x27;s accession to the throne six years later.

==July Revolution==
In 1830, during the July Revolution, the young Duke of Chartres was on garrison duty at Joigny. He made his regiment wear the tricolor cockade and quickly led them to aid the uprising in Paris. He was temporarily stopped at Montrouge, and entered Paris on 3 August at the head of his regiment. When his father was offered the French throne by the Chamber of Deputies, Prince Ferdinand Philippe received the title of Duke of Orléans, Prince of Orléans, and also became &quot;Prince Royal&quot;, the heir apparent to the throne. Upon entering the Conseil (at his father&#x27;s bidding), Ferdinand Philippe, who had something of a temper, criticised the time lost by ministers&#x27; prevarications and was frequently embroiled in skirmishes with the doctrinaires, to whom he wished to impart the sentiments of revolutionary youth. When Casimir Périer was nominated president of the &quot;Conseil&quot; in March 1831, he accepted the post only on condition that Ferdinand Philippe be excluded from the &quot;Conseil&quot;.

In November 1831, the young Duke of Orléans and Marshal Jean-de-Dieu Soult were sent to repress the Canut revolts. He acquitted himself of this difficult task without violence and managed to rapidly appease opponents of the July Monarchy, even gaining a certain popularity. During the cholera outbreak in 1832, he did not hesitate to take real risks in visiting the most sickly patients at the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, accompanied by Casimir Périer (who caught the disease and died). In the eyes of the people and the press he was seen as a generous prince, sincerely preoccupied with the plight of the poor, and he became a sort of icon for the dynastic opposition of politician Odilon Barrot, who saw in him the only prince capable of reconciling modern France&#x27;s democratic aspirations with the heritage of its monarchical past. On 2 March 1832 he was granted an annual income of 1 million francs under his father&#x27;s new Civil List.

==Military career==

In 1831, under Marshal Étienne Maurice Gérard, Ferdinand Philippe and his younger brother Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, set out on their first campaign. When the princes entered Belgium in 1831, they eagerly visited the plain of Jemmapes, where their father had fought in 1792. The following year, Ferdinand Philippe returned to Belgium in command of the vanguard brigade of the Armée du Nord. On 20 November 1832 he was before the citadel of Antwerp, and commanded the trenches on the night of 29/30 November. During the attack on the Saint-Laurent Lunette, he launched himself onto the parapet amidst a hail of projectiles to lead the action and arouse his soldiers&#x27; courage.

In 1835, when Marshal Bertrand Clauzel was sent to Algeria as Governor General, the young Prince Royal asked his father for permission to accompany him, so he could fight the Emir Abd El-Kader. He participated with Clauzel&#x27;s army in the Battle of Habrah, where he was wounded, and in the capture of Mascara in December 1835. He then participated in the taking of Tlemcen in January 1836. When he returned to Paris, it was with an aura of military glory, and he returned to Algeria in autumn 1839 to take possession of the country&#x27;s interior (from Constantine to Algiers) for France alongside Marshal Sylvain Charles Valée. He left Constantine on 16 October, three days after the second anniversary of the town&#x27;s capture, and reached Algiers on 2 November via Sétif and the Iron Gates pass. Abd-el-Kader saw this as a violation of the Treaty of Tafna and unleashed &quot;jihad&quot; upon the French. This led to an escalation in tension and, ultimately, Algeria&#x27;s wholesale occupation by France. Ferdinand Philippe set out for Algeria a third time in March 1840, taking with him his younger brother the Duke of Aumale, tutoring him in his first military experience. Present at the battles of Affroun, Oued&#x27;Ger and Bois des Oliviers, he was put in charge of directing the attackers in the capture of Teniah de Mouzaïa. After this campaign he was recalled to France for good.

This brilliant military career increased his popularity and prestige. He also devoted himself to the improvement of the troops&#x27; living conditions and morale. At Saint-Omer he organised the &quot;chasseurs de Vincennes&quot;, who became the &quot;chasseurs d&#x27;Orléans&quot; in 1836, and re-formed the &quot;chasseurs à pied de Vincennes&quot;. He laid the foundations for a &quot;Histoire des Régiments&quot;, commissioned by order of the Minister of War, and began writing the service histories of the two regiments he had himself commanded.

==Marriage negotiations==

Ferdinand Philippe&#x27;s marriage had long been one of the July Monarchy&#x27;s major political affairs. Had it not been for the 1830 Revolution, he would have married the sister of Henri, Count of Chambord, Louise d&#x27;Artois (1819–1864). Her family called off the marriage plans when Ferdinand Philippe&#x27;s branch of the family &#x27;usurped&#x27; the throne. From 1835, after an assassination attempt by Giuseppe Fieschi and his co-conspirators, Ferdinand Philippe&#x27;s father had been obsessed with the marital prospects of his son, then 25. Blanche-Joséphine Le Bascle d&#x27;Argenteuil noted, in her &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, that if the Prince Royal died young after having fathered a male heir, the July Monarchy would be faced with the prospect of a regency, in all its political uncertainty – thus, for her, the wisest course consisted of marrying off the King&#x27;s third son, then the fourth, then the fifth, guaranteeing Louis Philippe descendants, all the while leaving several men around the throne who could take over from him if he died suddenly.

At this time the July Monarchy was searching for new allies in Continental Europe so they would not have to depend solely on the United Kingdom. Talleyrand, fresh from renouncing his embassy to London and close to the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Palmerston, pointed in this direction. The King at first envisaged a rapprochement with Russia via Württemberg. King Wilhelm I, widower of Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, had two daughters of marriageable age, Princesses Marie (born 1816) and Sophie (born 1818). Wilhelm I&#x27;s sister Catharina had already made an inauspicious French marriage alliance to Jérôme Bonaparte and so Wilhelm declined the proposition as humiliating. He later was to accept Marie&#x27;s even more humiliating marriage to Count Alfred von Neipperg in 1840. Queen Louise wrote to her parents on Marie&#x27;s marriage that &quot;We see singular things. It was not at all probable that this daughter, who the king of Württemberg did not wish to give to Chartres for fear of his ending his days [in exile] in America, should end up marrying a miserable little Austrian officer without illustriousness and of very ordinary birth.&quot;

Louis Philippe next envisaged an alliance with Austria via the marriage of his son to Archduchess Maria Theresa (born 1816), daughter of Archduke Karl, Duke of Teschen (German: &quot;Herzog von Teschen&quot;). Queen Marie Amélie was highly favourable to such a match as she was herself a daughter of an Austrian archduchess (Maria Carolina of Austria), and Archduke Karl was not opposed to it. However, Karl faced determined opponents on two sides – Prince Metternich, who did not want to repeat his error in marrying Marie Louise to Napoleon, and Archduchess Sophie, a Bavarian princess and sister-in-law of the new Kaiser Ferdinand I, who dominated the Vienna court with her strong personality, and was awaiting her son Franz-Josef&#x27;s ascent to the imperial throne. France&#x27;s ambassador to Vienna, the Count of Sainte-Aulaire, who had been put in charge of preparing the ground for an Austrian match, felt the possibility was difficult if not completely impossible. The new President of the Conseil, Adolphe Thiers, dreamed of concluding such a match and becoming a new Duke of Choiseul as the maker of a spectacular reversal in the alliances of Europe.

Ferdinand Philippe and his younger brother, the Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours, set out on a European tour on 2 May 1836. Ferdinand Philippe and Queen Marie-Amélie got off to a bad start when the young French Prince Royal refused to shave off the proud beard that had set a fashion among French youth. She wrote back to Queen Louise complaining that &quot;there was a lack of tact there and of sentiments of convenience that afflicted me. [...] I believe that Leopold I can say to him that a goatee beard on the face of a prince royal is contrary to all German manners. Here, [such a beard] is neither handsome nor fortunate, there it can be fatal.&quot; The two French princes were a great success in Berlin and Vienna, staying at the latter from 29 May to 11 June. However, the Marquis de Sémonville commented that &quot;everyone has shaken their hand, but no one was close to them&quot;. Even if the young Prince Royal decidedly liked Archduke Karl and his daughter, Prince Metternich and the Archduchess Sophie put up a major barrage of problems, and news of Thiers (impatient to conclude the match) being on his way was enough to convince Louis Philippe to make a marriage proposal. He was refused, though to play to French susceptibilities the official version was that the refusal was because of the &quot;feelings&quot; of Archduchess Marie-Thérèse. Queen Louise wrote to her mother on 14 June 1836: &quot;I am upset to see that you have thrown your all behind the cause of Austria [...] I have always thought that Chartres was of too high birth to marry she who seems to him the most minor princess in Germany; and I avow that I would better like to see him marry a princess from Lippe or Waldeck who was good and pretty and of robust health, rather than an archduchess of Austria who would bring us all sorts of evils in her dowry. [...] Napoleon, in this situation, was able to make sacrifices to ally himself with Austria; and we all saw what profit he got from it. But we are not upstarts, and have no need of ennobling ourselves by uniting with the house of Lorraine&quot;.

The two young princes returned to France via Italy. At Trento they were received by Marie Louise, Duchess of Parma, the former Empress Consort of the French, who could not refrain from tears at the similarity between the Prince Royal and her son, the late Duke of Reichstadt. At Milan they stayed with Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria, Viceroy of Lombardy-Venetia, where they heard the news of Alibaud&#x27;s assassination attempt on King Louis Philippe on 25 June. After the Austrians&#x27; refusal of the match, only two potential Catholic princesses remained (Louis-Philippe confided to one of his familiars &quot;I would prefer her to be a Catholic. You believe it is nothing, the Carlists believe it is everything; and I myself believe that it is neither here nor there&quot;), and these were both very young for marriage (born in 1821): Princess Januaria of Brazil, daughter of Emperor Pedro I of Brazil, and the &quot;Infanta&quot; Isabella of Spain, daughter of the &quot;Infante&quot; Francisco de Paula, younger brother of King Ferdinand VII. The former was excluded by her remoteness, and the latter due to her family&#x27;s unfortunate history (her mother Princess Luisa Carlotta of the Two Sicilies, niece of Queen Marie-Amélie, was monstrously obese) and her physical appearance (she was red-haired and thin; Queen Louise wrote to Queen Marie-Amélie on 21 November 1836 that &quot;I send you her portrait, that Leopold found hideous. Her hair especially is frightening in terms of the children she will have. If all her family are ginger, this will afflict them [too]&quot;.

==Marriage==
Some possibilities were also seen among the Protestant German princesses. Via his great-niece the Duchess of Dino, Talleyrand suggested Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel (born 1817 to a cousin of the Elector of Hesse and his wife, a Danish princess), whilst Queen Louise suggested Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg (born 1818 to the Duke of Saxe-Altenburg and Princess Amelia of Wurtemberg, and who finally ended up marrying King George V of Hanover in 1843), and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (daughter of an elder brother of King Leopold I of the Belgians; she was actually raised a Catholic and married the Prince Royal&#x27;s younger brother, the Duke of Nemours, in 1840).

However, the negotiators&#x27; choice finally came to rest on Duchess Helene Luise Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (known as Hélène, 1814–1858), daughter of the late Prince Frederick Louis, Hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and his wife Princess Caroline Louise of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. For Ferdinand Philippe, it was a convenient alliance but one without much attraction; Metternich quipped that she was &quot;petite but of a good house&quot;. She was the niece of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia, whose wife was born Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (this did not avoid difficulties for the marriage in Berlin, which the French ambassador there, the Count Bresson, succeeded in resolving). Nicholas I of Russia, for his part, affected disdain of the marriage, proclaiming that such a minor marriage was not worth the trouble to prevent.

The Duke of Broglie was sent to Germany as ambassador extraordinary with the aim of presenting the official marriage request and bringing the princess back to France. An anonymous but virulent libel against the House of Orléans was published by a prince of the House of Mecklenburg. That House avoided the marriage, so that Duchess Hélène was only accompanied to France by her father&#x27;s widow, Augusta of Hesse-Homburg. The marriage was celebrated on 30 May 1837 at the Château de Fontainebleau, since Hyacinthe-Louis de Quélen, the Archbishop of Paris, had used the pretext of religious differences to forbid it from taking place in Notre Dame de Paris. The civil ceremony occurred in the &quot;galerie Henri II&quot; on 30 May 1837, presided over by the Baron Pasquier, whom the King rewarded on 27 May by making him Lord Chancellor of France. The Catholic ceremony was presided over by Romain-Frédéric Gallard, Bishop of Meaux, in the chapel of Henri IV, whilst the Lutheran one was celebrated by Pastor Cuvier in the &quot;Salon Louis Philippe&quot;. As his witnesses, Ferdinand Philippe had the four vice-presidents of the Chamber of Peers: Baron Séguier, Count Portalis, the Duke of Broglie, and the Count de Bastard; the president and four vice presidents of the Chamber of Deputies: Dupin, Jean-Louis Calmon, Delessert, Jacqueminot, Cunin-Gridaine; three marshals: the Duke of Dalmatie, the Count de Lobau and Gérard, as well as the Prince de Talleyrand, the Duke of Choiseul, and Count Bresson, France&#x27;s minister to Berlin.

The ceremony was well attended, but there was a notable lack of foreign ambassadors, except for Baron von Werther (Prussia), Count Le Hon (Belgium), and the chargé d&#x27;affaires of Mecklembourg. The reception was brilliant; the Duchesse de Maillé observed:
The marriage was very happy and produced two children: 

#Prince Philippe, Count of Paris (1838–1894), Prince Royal, married Princess Marie Isabelle of Orléans, Infanta of Spain (1848–1919), and had issue.
#Prince Robert, Duke of Chartres (1840–1910), married Princess Françoise of Orléans (1844–1925) and had issue.

==Patron of the arts==
Ferdinand Philippe loved literature, music, and the fine arts, and had a pronounced taste for collecting, &quot;making his choice slowly, like a true lover [of the arts]&quot;. Each year he spent 100,000 to 150,000 francs from his Civil List allowance on art purchases or cultural patronage. In his vast apartments in the Palais des Tuileries he gathered medieval and Renaissance objects, ceramics by Bernard Palissy, Hispano-Moorish majolica and ceramics, Chinese and Japanese porcelain, and furniture by Caffieri, Oeben, Riesener, and Jacob.
He was passionate about modern painters, buying several canvasses from Ary Scheffer and Newton Fielding, both of whom had taught Ferdinand Philippe landscape painting from 1822 to 1830. He possessed works by Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix (&quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot;, &quot;The Assassination of the Bishop of Liège&quot;, &quot;Hamlet and Horatio in the Graveyard&quot;), Alexandre-Gabriel Decamps (&quot;The Defeat of the Cimbri&quot;), Eugène Lami, Ernest Meissonnier, and Paul Delaroche. He loved landscapes by painters of the Barbizon school, notably Camille Corot, Paul Huet, and Théodore Rousseau. He commissioned Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres to paint &quot;Antiochus and Stratonice&quot; (1833), bought his &quot;Œdipus and the Sphinx&quot; in 1839, and commissioned his portrait from him in 1840.

Himself a talented draughtsman, Ferdinand Philippe made amateur engravings – twelve etchings and lithographs by him are known, including a satire showing the sleeping Gulliver with Lilliputians all round him on foot and on horseback and a sign referring to the alarmist proclamation of 11 July 1792 by the Legislative Assembly that declared the fatherland to be in danger.

==Death==


In 1842, the Duke was scheduled to leave for Saint-Omer to review part of the army of which he had been made the commander that was engaged at the Marne. He planned to travel from the Tuileries Palace to Neuilly-sur-Seine on 13 July 1842 to say goodbye to his family, and, for the sake of expediency, opted for an open carriage. When the horses of his carriage ran out of control at Sablonville in the Hauts-de-Seine &quot;département,&quot; he lost his balance and fractured his skull, and, despite the best attentions of his doctors, the 31-year-old Duke died some hours later, surrounded by family members who had rushed to the scene. Alfred de Musset evoked the accident in his poem &quot;Le Treize Juillet&quot; (in the collection &quot;Poésies nouvelles&quot;).

Ferdinand Philippe&#x27;s funeral service was held in Notre Dame which was covered not in black fabric (of which there wasn&#x27;t enough) but, at the suggestion of the architect Visconti, black paper. He was interred in an elaborate tomb in the Chapelle Royale, in Dreux, Eure-et-Loir.

Deprived of the popular support his eldest son had had, Louis Philippe and his regime fell six years later. He, his family, and Ferdinand Philippe&#x27;s widow Princess Hélène went into exile in Great Britain. There, Hélène died nearly 16 years after her husband, on 18 May 1858 in Richmond, Surrey. Because Hélène was a Protestant, she could not be buried in the Catholic Chapelle Royale at Dreux. Instead, a room with a separate entrance was built attached to the chapel and a window was opened between her tomb and her husband&#x27;s. The sculpture of the Protestant princess rests atop her tomb, depicting her reaching through the opening to the tomb of her beloved Catholic prince and husband Ferdinand Philippe.

<text>Jeremy Taylor (1613–1667) was a cleric in the Church of England who achieved fame as an author during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell. He is sometimes known as the &quot;Shakespeare of Divines&quot; for his poetic style of expression, and he is frequently cited as one of the greatest prose writers in the English language.

Taylor was under the patronage of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. He went on to become chaplain in ordinary to King Charles I as a result of Laud&#x27;s sponsorship. This made him politically suspect when Laud was tried by Parliament and executed in January 1644/5 during the English Civil War. After the parliamentary victory over the King, he was briefly imprisoned several times.

Eventually, he was allowed to live quietly in Wales, where he became the private chaplain of the Earl of Carbery. After the Restoration, he was made Bishop of Down and Connor in Ireland. He also became Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin.

He is remembered in the liturgical calendars of the Church of England and other Anglican churches.

== Early life ==
Taylor was born in Cambridge, the son of a barber, Nathaniel. He was baptised, as a child, on 15 August 1613 at Holy Trinity Church, Cambridge. His father was educated and taught him grammar and mathematics. He was then educated at the Perse School, Cambridge, before going to Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, where he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1630/1631 and a Master of Arts degree in 1634.

The best evidence of his diligence as a student is the enormous learning of which he showed so easy a command in later years. In 1633, although still below the canonical age, he took holy orders, and accepted the invitation of Thomas Risden, a former fellow student, to supply his place for a short time as lecturer at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

== Career under Laud ==
Archbishop William Laud sent for Taylor to preach in his presence at Lambeth, and took the young man under his wing. Taylor did not vacate his fellowship at Cambridge before 1636, but he spent, apparently, much of his time in London, for Laud desired that his considerable talents should receive better opportunities for study and improvement than the obligations of constant preaching would permit. In November 1635 he had been nominated by Laud to a fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, where, says Antony Wood, love and admiration still waited on him. He seems, however, to have spent little time there. He became chaplain to his patron the archbishop, and chaplain in ordinary to Charles I.

At Oxford, William Chillingworth was then busy with his magnum opus, &quot;The Religion of Protestants&quot;, and it is possible that through his discussions with Chillingworth Taylor may have been turned towards the liberal movement of his age. After two years in Oxford, he was presented, in March 1638, by William Juxon, Bishop of London, to the rectory of Uppingham in Rutland. There he settled down to the work of a country priest.

In the next year he married Phoebe Langsdale, by whom he had six children: William (d.1642), George (?), Richard (the last two died c.1656/7), Charles, Phoebe and Mary. In the autumn of the same year he was appointed to preach in St Mary&#x27;s on the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, and apparently used the occasion to clear himself of a suspicion, which, however, haunted him through life, of a secret leaning to the Roman Catholic position. This suspicion seems to have arisen chiefly from his intimacy with Christopher Davenport, better known as Francis a Sancta Clara, a learned Franciscan friar who became chaplain to Queen Henrietta; but it may have been strengthened by his known connection with Laud, as well as by his ascetic habits. More serious consequences followed his attachment to the Royalist cause. As the author of &quot;The Sacred Order and Offices of Episcopacy or Episcopacy Asserted against the Arians and Acephali New and Old&quot; (1642), he could scarcely hope to retain his parish, which was not, however, sequestered until 1644. Taylor probably accompanied the king to Oxford. In 1643 he was presented to the rectory of Overstone, Northamptonshire, by Charles I. There he would be in close connection with his friend and patron Spencer Compton, 2nd Earl of Northampton.

== Royalist prisoner ==

During the next fifteen years, Taylor&#x27;s movements are not easily traced. He seems to have been in London during the last weeks of Charles I in 1649, from whom he is said to have received his watch and some jewels which had ornamented the ebony case in which he kept his Bible. He had been taken prisoner with other Royalists in the siege of Cardigan Castle on 4 February 1645. In 1646 he is found in partnership with two other deprived clergymen, keeping a school at Newton Hall, in the parish of Llanfihangel Aberbythych, Carmarthenshire. Here he became private chaplain to and benefited from the hospitality of Richard Vaughan, 2nd Earl of Carbery, whose mansion, Golden Grove, is immortalised in the title of Taylor&#x27;s still popular manual of devotion, and whose first wife was a constant friend of Taylor. At Golden Grove Taylor wrote some of his most distinguished works. Alice, the third Lady Carbery, was the original of the Lady in John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Comus&quot;. Taylor&#x27;s first wife had died early in 1651. His second wife was Joanna Bridges or Brydges, said to be a natural daughter of Charles I; there is no good evidence for this. She owned a good estate, though probably impoverished by Parliamentarian exactions, at Mandinam, in Carmarthenshire. Several years following their marriage, they moved to Ireland. From time to time Taylor appears in London in the company of his friend John Evelyn, in whose &quot;Diary&quot; and correspondence his name repeatedly occurs. He was imprisoned three times: in 1645 for an injudicious preface to his &quot;Golden Grove&quot;; again in Chepstow Castle, from May to October 1655, on what charge does not appear; and a third time in the Tower in 1657, because of the indiscretion of his publisher, Richard Royston, who had decorated his &quot;Collection of Offices&quot; with a print representing Christ in the attitude of prayer.

== Writings ==
&quot;The Rule and Exercises of Holy Living&quot; provided a manual of Christian practice, which has retained its place with devout readers. The scope of the work is described on the title page. It deals with the means and instruments of obtaining every virtue, and the remedies against every vice, and considerations serving to the resisting all temptations, together with prayers containing the whole Duty of a Christian. &quot;Holy Dying&quot; was perhaps even more popular. A very charming piece of work of a lighter kind was inspired by a question from his friend, Katherine Philipps (&quot;the matchless Orinda&quot;), asking &quot;How far is a dear and perfect friendship authorised by the principles of Christianity?&quot; In answer to this, he dedicated to Mrs Phillipps his &quot;Discourse of the Nature, Offices and Measures of Friendship&quot; (1657). His &quot;Ductor Dubitantium, or the Rule of Conscience …&quot; (1660) was intended to be the standard manual of casuistry and ethics for the Christian people. His works were translated into Welsh by Nathanael Jones.

== Bishop in Ireland at the Restoration ==
He probably left Wales in 1657, and his immediate connection with Golden Grove seems to have ceased two years earlier. In 1658, through the kind offices of his friend John Evelyn, Taylor was offered a lectureship in Lisburn, County Antrim, by Edward Conway, 2nd Viscount Conway. At first, he declined a post in which the duty was to be shared with a Presbyterian – or, as he expressed it, &quot;where a Presbyterian and myself [shall be] like Castor and Pollux, the one up the other downe&quot; – and to which a meagre salary was attached. He was, however, induced to take it, and found in his patron&#x27;s property at Portmore, on Lough Neagh, a congenial retreat.

At the Stuart Restoration, instead of being recalled to England, as he probably expected and certainly desired, he was appointed to the see of Down and Connor, to which was shortly added the additional responsibility for overviewing the adjacent diocese of Dromore. As bishop, he commissioned in 1661 the building of a new cathedral at Dromore for the Dromore diocese. He was also made a member of the privy council of Ireland and, in 1660, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dublin. None of these positions was a sinecure.

Of the university he wrote:
Accordingly, he set himself vigorously to the task of framing and enforcing regulations for the admission and conduct of members of the university, and also of establishing lectureships. His episcopal labours were still more arduous. There were, at the date of the Restoration, about seventy Presbyterian ministers in the north of Ireland, and most of these were from the west of Scotland, with a dislike for Episcopacy which distinguished the Covenanting party. No wonder that Taylor, writing to James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde shortly after his consecration, should have said, &quot;I perceive myself thrown into a place of torment&quot;. His letters perhaps somewhat exaggerate the danger in which he lived, but there is no doubt that his authority was resisted and his overtures rejected.

This was Taylor&#x27;s golden opportunity to show the wise toleration he had earlier advocated, but the new bishop had nothing to offer the Presbyterian clergy but the alternative of submission to episcopal ordination and jurisdiction or deprivation. Consequently, at his first visitation, he declared thirty-six churches to be vacant; and repossession was secured on his orders. At the same time, many of the gentry were apparently won over by his undoubted sincerity and devotedness as well as by his eloquence. With the Roman Catholic element of the population he was less successful. Not knowing the English language, and firmly attached to their traditional forms of worship, they were nonetheless compelled to attend a service they considered profane, conducted in a language they could not understand.

As Reginald Heber says:

During this period, he was married a second time to Joanna Brydges, supposedly a natural daughter of Charles I. From this marriage, two daughters were born: Mary, who went on to marry Archbishop Francis Marsh and had issue and Joanna, who married Edward Harrison, MP for Lisburn, and had issue. From his father-in-law, Marsh inherited a silver watch, said to have been a gift from Charles I; this watch remained in the family of his great-grandson, Francis Marsh, barrister-at-law.

Taylor died at Lisburn on 13 August 1667. He was buried at Dromore Cathedral where an apsidal chancel was built in 1870 over the crypt where he was laid to rest.

Jeremy Taylor is honoured in the Church of England, the Anglican Church of Canada, Scottish Episcopal Church, Anglican Church of Australia and in the Episcopal Church of the United States on 13 August.

== Family ==
Jeremy Taylor is said to have been a lineal descendant of Rowland Taylor, but the assertion has not been proved. Through his daughter, Mary, who married Archbishop Francis Marsh, he had numerous descendants.

== Principal publications ==

*&quot;The Worthy Communicant; or a Discourse of the Nature, Effects, and Blessings consequent to the worthy receiving of the Lords Supper …&quot; (1660)

Although Taylor is named as the author on the title page of &quot;Contemplations of the State of Man in this Life, and in that which is to Come&quot; (1684), the work is an abridgement of Vivian Mullineaux&#x27;s 1672 English translation of Juan Eusebio Nieremberg&#x27;s work &quot;De la diferencia entre lo temporal y lo eterno, y Crisol de Desengaños&quot; (&quot;On the Difference between the Temporal and the Eternal, and the Crucible of Deceptions&quot;, 1640), apparently compiled by Taylor.

<text>In mathematics, the special unitary group of degree , denoted , is the Lie group of unitary matrices with determinant 1.

The matrices of the more general unitary group may have complex determinants with absolute value 1, rather than real 1 in the special case.

The group operation is matrix multiplication. The special unitary group is a normal subgroup of the unitary group , consisting of all unitary matrices. As a compact classical group, is the group that preserves the standard inner product on formula_1. It is itself a subgroup of the general linear group, formula_2

The groups find wide application in the Standard Model of particle physics, especially in the electroweak interaction and in quantum chromodynamics.

The simplest case, , is the trivial group, having only a single element. The group is isomorphic to the group of quaternions of norm 1, and is thus diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere. Since unit quaternions can be used to represent rotations in 3-dimensional space (up to sign), there is a surjective homomorphism from to the rotation group whose kernel is . Since the quaternions can be identified as the even subalgebra of the Clifford Algebra , is in fact identical to one of the symmetry groups of spinors, Spin(3), that enables a spinor presentation of rotations.

== Properties ==
The special unitary group is a strictly real Lie group (vs. a more general complex Lie group). Its dimension as a real manifold is . Topologically, it is compact and simply connected. Algebraically, it is a simple Lie group (meaning its Lie algebra is simple; see below).

The center of is isomorphic to the cyclic group formula_3, and is composed of the diagonal matrices for an th root of unity and the identity matrix.

Its outer automorphism group for is formula_4 while the outer automorphism group of is the trivial group.

A maximal torus of rank is given by the set of diagonal matrices with determinant . The Weyl group of is the symmetric group , which is represented by signed permutation matrices (the signs being necessary to ensure that the determinant is ).

The Lie algebra of , denoted by formula_5, can be identified with the set of traceless anti‑Hermitian complex matrices, with the regular commutator as a Lie bracket. Particle physicists often use a different, equivalent representation: The set of traceless Hermitian complex matrices with Lie bracket given by times the commutator.

== Lie algebra ==
The Lie algebra formula_5 of formula_7 consists of skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero. This (real) Lie algebra has dimension . More information about the structure of this Lie algebra can be found below in &quot;&quot;.

=== Fundamental representation ===
In the physics literature, it is common to identify the Lie algebra with the space of trace-zero &quot;Hermitian&quot; (rather than the skew-Hermitian) matrices. That is to say, the physicists&#x27; Lie algebra differs by a factor of formula_8 from the mathematicians&#x27;. With this convention, one can then choose generators that are traceless Hermitian complex matrices, where:

formula_9

where the are the structure constants and are antisymmetric in all indices, while the -coefficients are symmetric in all indices.

As a consequence, the commutator is:

formula_10

and the corresponding anticommutator is:

formula_11

The factor of in the commutation relation arises from the physics convention and is not present when using the mathematicians&#x27; convention.

The conventional normalization condition is
formula_12

The generators satisfy the Jacobi identity:

formula_13

By convention, in the physics literature the generators formula_14 are defined as the traceless Hermitian complex matrices with a formula_15 prefactor: for the formula_16 group, the generators are chosen as formula_17 where formula_18 are the Pauli matrices, while for the case of formula_19 one defines formula_20 where formula_21 are the Gell-Mann matrices. With these definitions, the generators satisfy the following normalization condition:

formula_22

=== Adjoint representation ===
In the -dimensional adjoint representation, the generators are represented by matrices, whose elements are defined by the structure constants themselves:

formula_23

== The group SU(2) ==
Using matrix multiplication for the binary operation, forms a group,

formula_24

where the overline denotes complex conjugation.

=== Diffeomorphism with the 3-sphere &quot;S&quot;3 ===
If we consider formula_25 as a pair in formula_26 where formula_27 and formula_28, then the equation formula_29 becomes

formula_30

This is the equation of the 3-sphere S3. This can also be seen using an embedding: the map

formula_31

where formula_32 denotes the set of 2 by 2 complex matrices, is an injective real linear map (by considering formula_26 diffeomorphic to formula_34 and formula_32 diffeomorphic to formula_36). Hence, the restriction of to the 3-sphere (since modulus is 1), denoted , is an embedding of the 3-sphere onto a compact submanifold of formula_32, namely .

Therefore, as a manifold, is diffeomorphic to , which shows that is simply connected and that can be endowed with the structure of a compact, connected Lie group.

=== Isomorphism with group of versors ===
Quaternions of norm 1 are called versors since they generate the rotation group SO(3):
The matrix:

formula_38

can be mapped to the quaternion

formula_39

This map is in fact a group isomorphism. Additionally, the determinant of the matrix is the squared norm of the corresponding quaternion. Clearly any matrix in is of this form and, since it has determinant , the corresponding quaternion has norm . Thus is isomorphic to the group of versors.

=== Relation to spatial rotations ===

Every versor is naturally associated to a spatial rotation in 3 dimensions, and the product of versors is associated to the composition of the associated rotations. Furthermore, every rotation arises from exactly two versors in this fashion. In short: there is a 2:1 surjective homomorphism from to ; consequently is isomorphic to the quotient group , the manifold underlying is obtained by identifying antipodal points of the 3-sphere , and is the universal cover of .

=== Lie algebra ===
The Lie algebra of consists of skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero. Explicitly, this means

formula_40

The Lie algebra is then generated by the following matrices,

formula_41

which have the form of the general element specified above.

This can also be written as formula_42 using the Pauli matrices.

These satisfy the quaternion relationships formula_43 formula_44 and formula_45 The commutator bracket is therefore specified by

formula_46

The above generators are related to the Pauli matrices by formula_47 and formula_48 This representation is routinely used in quantum mechanics to represent the spin of fundamental particles such as electrons. They also serve as unit vectors for the description of our 3 spatial dimensions in loop quantum gravity. They also correspond to the Pauli X, Y, and Z gates, which are standard generators for the single qubit gates, corresponding to 3d rotations about the axes of the Bloch sphere.

The Lie algebra serves to work out the representations of.

== SU(3) ==
The group is an 8-dimensional simple Lie group consisting of all unitary matrices with determinant 1.

=== Topology ===
The group is a simply-connected, compact Lie group. Its topological structure can be understood by noting that acts transitively on the unit sphere formula_49 in formula_50. The stabilizer of an arbitrary point in the sphere is isomorphic to , which topologically is a 3-sphere. It then follows that is a fiber bundle over the base with fiber . Since the fibers and the base are simply connected, the simple connectedness of then follows by means of a standard topological result (the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for fiber bundles).

The -bundles over are classified by formula_51 since any such bundle can be constructed by looking at trivial bundles on the two hemispheres formula_52 and looking at the transition function on their intersection, which is a copy of , so

formula_53

Then, all such transition functions are classified by homotopy classes of maps

formula_54

and as formula_55 rather than formula_56, cannot be the trivial bundle , and therefore must be the unique nontrivial (twisted) bundle. This can be shown by looking at the induced long exact sequence on homotopy groups.

=== Representation theory ===
The representation theory of is well-understood. Descriptions of these representations, from the point of view of its complexified Lie algebra formula_57, may be found in the articles on Lie algebra representations or the Clebsch–Gordan coefficients for.

=== Lie algebra ===
The generators, , of the Lie algebra formula_58 of in the defining (particle physics, Hermitian) representation, are

formula_59

where , the Gell-Mann matrices, are the analog of the Pauli matrices for :

formula_60

These span all traceless Hermitian matrices of the Lie algebra, as required. Note that are antisymmetric.

They obey the relations

formula_61

or, equivalently,

formula_62

The are the structure constants of the Lie algebra, given by

formula_63

while all other not related to these by permutation are zero. In general, they vanish unless they contain an odd number of indices from the set .

The symmetric coefficients take the values

formula_64

They vanish if the number of indices from the set is odd.

A generic group element generated by a traceless 3×3 Hermitian matrix , normalized as , can be expressed as a &quot;second order&quot; matrix polynomial in :

formula_65
LP
where

formula_66

== Lie algebra structure ==
As noted above, the Lie algebra formula_5 of consists of skew-Hermitian matrices with trace zero.

The complexification of the Lie algebra formula_5 is formula_69, the space of all complex matrices with trace zero. A Cartan subalgebra then consists of the diagonal matrices with trace zero, which we identify with vectors in formula_70 whose entries sum to zero. The roots then consist of all the permutations of .

A choice of simple roots is

formula_71

So, is of rank and its Dynkin diagram is given by , a chain of nodes: ... Its Cartan matrix is

formula_72

Its Weyl group or Coxeter group is the symmetric group , the symmetry group of the -simplex.

== Generalized special unitary group ==
For a field , the generalized special unitary group over &quot;F&quot;, , is the group of all linear transformations of determinant 1 of a vector space of rank over which leave invariant a nondegenerate, Hermitian form of signature . This group is often referred to as the special unitary group of signature over . The field can be replaced by a commutative ring, in which case the vector space is replaced by a free module.

Specifically, fix a Hermitian matrix of signature in formula_73, then all

formula_74

satisfy

formula_75

Often one will see the notation without reference to a ring or field; in this case, the ring or field being referred to is formula_76 and this gives one of the classical Lie groups. The standard choice for when formula_77 is

formula_78

However, there may be better choices for for certain dimensions which exhibit more behaviour under restriction to subrings of formula_76.

=== Example ===
An important example of this type of group is the Picard modular group formula_80 which acts (projectively) on complex hyperbolic space of dimension two, in the same way that formula_81 acts (projectively) on real hyperbolic space of dimension two. In 2005 Gábor Francsics and Peter Lax computed an explicit fundamental domain for the action of this group on .

A further example is formula_82, which is isomorphic to formula_83.

== Important subgroups ==
In physics the special unitary group is used to represent fermionic symmetries. In theories of symmetry breaking it is important to be able to find the subgroups of the special unitary group. Subgroups of that are important in GUT physics are, for ,

formula_84

where × denotes the direct product and , known as the circle group, is the multiplicative group of all complex numbers with absolute value 1.

For completeness, there are also the orthogonal and symplectic subgroups,

formula_85

Since the rank of is and of is 1, a useful check is that the sum of the ranks of the subgroups is less than or equal to the rank of the original group. is a subgroup of various other Lie groups,

formula_86
See &quot;Spin group&quot; and &quot;Simple Lie group&quot; for , , and .

There are also the accidental isomorphisms: , , and .

One may finally mention that is the double covering group of , a relation that plays an important role in the theory of rotations of 2-spinors in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.

== SU(1, 1) ==
formula_87 where formula_88 denotes the complex conjugate of the complex number .

This group is isomorphic to and where the numbers separated by a comma refer to the signature of the quadratic form preserved by the group. The expression formula_89 in the definition of is an Hermitian form which becomes an isotropic quadratic form when and are expanded with their real components.

An early appearance of this group was as the &quot;unit sphere&quot; of coquaternions, introduced by James Cockle in 1852. Let

formula_90

Then formula_91 formula_92 the 2×2 identity matrix, formula_93 and formula_94 and the elements and all anticommute, as in quaternions. Also formula_8 is still a square root of (negative of the identity matrix), whereas formula_96 are not, unlike in quaternions. For both quaternions and coquaternions, all scalar quantities are treated as implicit multiples of and notated as .

The coquaternion formula_97 with scalar , has conjugate formula_98 similar to Hamilton&#x27;s quaternions. The quadratic form is formula_99

Note that the 2-sheet hyperboloid formula_100 corresponds to the imaginary units in the algebra so that any point on this hyperboloid can be used as a pole of a sinusoidal wave according to Euler&#x27;s formula.

The hyperboloid is stable under , illustrating the isomorphism with . The variability of the pole of a wave, as noted in studies of polarization, might view elliptical polarization as an exhibit of the elliptical shape of a wave with The Poincaré sphere model used since 1892 has been compared to a 2-sheet hyperboloid model, and the practice of interferometry has been introduced.

When an element of is interpreted as a Möbius transformation, it leaves the unit disk stable, so this group represents the motions of the Poincaré disk model of hyperbolic plane geometry. Indeed, for a point in the complex projective line, the action of is given by

formula_101

since in projective coordinates formula_102

Writing formula_103 complex number arithmetic shows

formula_104
where formula_105

Therefore, formula_106 so that their ratio lies in the open disk.

<text>Dame Penelope Alice Wilton (born 3 June 1946) is an English actress. She was formerly married to fellow actor Sir Ian Holm and as she hasn&#x27;t yet remarried, retains her married style of Lady Holm.

Wilton is known for starring opposite Richard Briers in the BBC sitcom &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot; (1984–1989); playing Homily in &quot;The Borrowers&quot; (1992) and &quot;The Return of the Borrowers&quot; (1993); and for her role as the widowed Isobel Crawley in the ITV drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; (2010–2015). She also played the recurring role of Harriet Jones in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005–2008) and Anne in Ricky Gervais&#x27; Netflix dark comedy &quot;After Life&quot;. 

Wilton has had an extensive career on stage, receiving six Olivier Award nominations. She was nominated for &quot;Man and Superman&quot; (1981), &quot;The Secret Rapture&quot; (1988), &quot;The Deep Blue Sea&quot; (1994), &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; (2008) and &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (2009), before winning the 2015 Olivier Award for Best Actress for &quot;Taken at Midnight&quot;. Her film appearances include &quot;Clockwise&quot; (1986), &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987), &quot;Blame It on the Bellboy&quot; (1992), &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; (2003), &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), &quot;The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel&quot; (2012), &quot;The Girl&quot; (2012), &quot;The BFG&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry&quot; (2023).

==Early life and background==
Wilton was born in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the second of three daughters of Cliff Wilton, a Cambridge-educated businessman and barrister who had played rugby union on the amateur and provincial level, going on to be an administrator in the sport, and Alice Linda Travers, a tap dancer and former actress. 

She is a niece of actors Bill Travers and Linden Travers. Her cousins include actors Angela and Richard Morant. Her maternal grandparents owned theatres.

She attended the Drama Centre London from 1965 to 1968.

==Career==
Wilton began her career on stage in 1969 at the Nottingham Playhouse. Her early roles included Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot;, both in Nottingham and at The Old Vic.

She made her Broadway debut in March 1971 when she played Araminta in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Philanthropist&quot;, and made her West End debut in August 1971 opposite Sir Ralph Richardson in the John Osborne play &quot;West of Suez&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre. She had previously appeared in both plays at the Royal Court Theatre. She played Ruth in the original 1974 London stage production of Alan Ayckbourn&#x27;s &quot;Norman Conquests&quot; trilogy, initially as understudy for Bridget Turner.

Her television acting career began in 1972, playing Vivie Warren in the BBC2&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot; opposite Coral Browne in the title role and Robert Powell. The production was repeated as part of the &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series in 1974 on BBC1. In 1994, Wilton portrayed Browne in a radio adaptation of &quot;An Englishman Abroad&quot; for the BBC World Service and repeated on various BBC radio formats since. 

Following the broadcast of &quot;Mrs. Warren&#x27;s Profession&quot;, Wilton then had several major TV roles, including two of the BBC Television Shakespeare productions (as Desdemona in &quot;Othello&quot; and Regan in &quot;King Lear&quot; ).

Wilton&#x27;s film career includes roles in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1981), &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; (1987), &quot;Iris&quot; (2001), &quot;Calendar Girls&quot; (2003) and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004), Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice&quot; (2005), Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Match Point&quot; (2005), and in &quot;The History Boys&quot; (2006).

She did not garner fame until she appeared with Richard Briers in the 1984 BBC situation comedy, &quot;Ever Decreasing Circles&quot;, which ran for five years. She played Ann, long suffering wife of Martin (Briers), an obsessive and pedantic &quot;do-gooder&quot;. In 2005, Wilton guest starred as Harriet Jones for two episodes in the BBC&#x27;s revival of the popular TV science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. This guest role was written especially for her by the programme&#x27;s chief writer and executive producer Russell T. Davies, with whom she had worked on &quot;Bob and Rose&quot; (ITV, 2001). The character of Jones returned as Prime Minister in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; 2005 Christmas special &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot;. In the first part of the 2008 series finale, &quot;The Stolen Earth&quot;, she made a final appearance, now as the former Prime Minister who sacrifices herself by extermination by the Daleks so that the Doctor&#x27;s companions can contact him.

Wilton appeared on television as Barbara Poole, the mother of a missing woman, in the BBC television drama series &quot;Five Days&quot; in 2005; and in ITV&#x27;s drama &quot;Half Broken Things&quot; (October 2007) and the BBC production of &quot;The Passion&quot; (Easter 2008). Beginning in 2010, she appeared as Isobel Crawley in all six seasons of the hit period drama &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;. She was the castaway on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in April 2008. In December 2012 and February 2013, she was the narrator in Lin Coghlan&#x27;s dramatisation of Elizabeth Jane Howard&#x27;s &quot;The Cazalets&quot;, broadcast on BBC Radio.

==Personal life==
Between 1975 and 1984, Wilton was married to actor Daniel Massey. They had a daughter, Alice, born in 1977. Before that, they had a stillborn son.

In 1991, Wilton married actor Ian Holm. In 1992, they appeared together as Pod and Homily in the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Borrowers&quot;. A year later, they appeared together in a follow-up &quot;The Return of the Borrowers&quot;. In 1998, Ian Holm was knighted and Wilton became Lady Holm. They divorced in 2001.

==Honours==
Wilton was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 New Year Honours and was elevated to become a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours, both for services to drama.

==Awards and recognition==
In 2012, Wilton received an honorary doctorate from the University of Hull Scarborough Campus.

<text>Thomas Carlyle Ford (born August 27, 1961) is an American fashion designer and filmmaker. He launched his eponymous brand in 2005, having previously been the creative director at Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. Ford wrote and directed the films &quot;A Single Man&quot; (2009) and &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; (2016). From 2019 to 2022, he was chairman of the Council of Fashion Designers of America.

== Early life ==
Thomas Carlyle Ford was born on August 27, 1961, in Austin, Texas, the son of realtors Shirley Burton (née Shirley Ann Thrasher) and Thomas David Ford (1932–2020). He spent his early life in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, and in San Marcos, outside Austin. He rearranged furniture in the house at 6, and gave his mother advice on her hair and shoes. His family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he was 11. In Santa Fe, he entered St. Michael&#x27;s High School and later moved to Santa Fe Preparatory School.

At age 16, he enrolled at Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock, but quickly dropped out. He moved to New York City to study art history at New York University. There he met Ian Falconer, who took him to Studio 54 for the first time. Ford dropped out after a year, focusing on acting in television commercials.

Ford began studying interior architecture at The New School&#x27;s art and design college, Parsons The New School for Design, in New York City. He continued to frequent Studio 54, where he realized he was gay. The club&#x27;s disco-era glamor would be a major influence on his later designs. Before his last year at New School, Ford spent a year and a half in Paris, where he worked as an intern in Chloé&#x27;s press office, inspiring his interest in fashion. He spent his final year at The New School studying fashion, but graduated with a degree in architecture.

== Fashion career ==
=== Early career ===
When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended The New School&#x27;s Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture, and that his work at Chloé was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: &quot;I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, &#x27;Armani and Chanel.&#x27; Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, &#x27;Because you were wearing something Armani.&#x27; Is it any wonder he got the job?&quot; Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years.

In 1988, Ford moved to Perry Ellis, where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company&#x27;s president, and Marc Jacobs, its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with &quot;The New York Times&quot;, he commented, &quot;If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It&#x27;s looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style.&quot;

At the time, Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women&#x27;s ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company&#x27;s creative director, Dawn Mello said, &quot;no one would dream of wearing Gucci&quot;. In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand&#x27;s chief women&#x27;s ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan. &quot;I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn&#x27;t want the job,&quot; Mello said. &quot;For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky.&quot; Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September.

Ford&#x27;s role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position, heading the brand&#x27;s ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company&#x27;s chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, &quot;Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black.&quot; Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, Domenico De Sole insisted that he remain. Nonetheless, Ford&#x27;s work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company&#x27;s public face.

=== Creative Director of Gucci and Saint Laurent ===
In 1994, Ford was promoted to Creative Director of Gucci. In his first year at the helm, he introduced Halston-style velvet hipsters, skinny satin shirts and car-finish metallic patent boots. In 1995, he brought in French stylist Carine Roitfeld and photographer Mario Testino to create a series of new ad campaigns for the company. Between 1995 and 1996, sales at Gucci increased by 90%. At one point, Ford was the largest individual shareholder of Gucci stock and options. By 1999, the house, which had been almost insolvent when Ford joined, was valued at more than $4 billion.

When Gucci acquired the house of Yves Saint Laurent (YSL) in 1999, Ford was named Creative Director of that label as well. Saint Laurent did not hide his displeasure with Ford&#x27;s designs, stating &quot;The poor man does what he can.&quot; During his time as creative director for YSL, Ford nonetheless won numerous Council of Fashion Designers of America Awards. Ford was able to pull the classic fashion house back into the mainstream. His advertising campaigns for the YSL fragrances Opium (with a red-haired Sophie Dahl naked wearing only a necklace and stiletto heels in a sexually suggestive pose) and YSL M7 (with martial arts champion Samuel de Cubber in complete full-frontal nudity) were controversial and provocative.

In April 2004, Ford parted ways with the Gucci group after he and CEO Domenico de Sole, who is credited as Ford&#x27;s partner in Gucci&#x27;s success, failed to agree with Pinault Printemps Redoute&#x27;s boss over control of the Group. He has since referred to this experience as &quot;devastating&quot; and as a &quot;midlife crisis&quot; because he had &quot;put everything into that for fifteen years&quot;. When Ford left in 2004, Gucci Group was valued at $10 billion. Four people were hired to split the work Ford had done.

=== Tom Ford label ===
After leaving Gucci, Ford launched a line of menswear, beauty, eyewear, and accessories in 2006, named after himself. De Sole became chairman of the label. Ford has described &quot;the Tom Ford customer&quot; as international, cultured, well-traveled, and possessing disposable income. For women, he added &quot;strong women, … intelligent women who know their own style&quot;.

First Lady Michelle Obama wore an ivory floor-length evening gown designed by Ford to Buckingham Palace in 2011. He has also dressed Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Gwyneth Paltrow, Anne Hathaway, Daniel Craig, Tom Hanks, Johnny Depp, Ryan Gosling, Will Smith, Julianne Moore, Hugh Jackman, Jon Hamm, and Henry Cavill. Ford designed Daniel Craig&#x27;s suits for his final four James Bond films: &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (2008), &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), and &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021).

In 2013, Ford was mentioned in Justin Timberlake&#x27;s song &quot;Suit &amp; Tie&quot;, which was a collaboration with Jay-Z. Ford created the suits, shirts, and accessories for the Grammy winning &quot;Suit &amp; Tie&quot; music video. He went on to dress Timberlake&#x27;s 20/20 Experience World Tour, designing over 600 pieces for the tour. The same year, Jay-Z released a song titled &quot;Tom Ford&quot; with &quot;Tom Ford&quot; rapped numerous times within the song. Ford responded that he was flattered and &quot;it means that one has really penetrated and made an impact on popular culture.&quot; Following the song&#x27;s release, Ford received a huge spike in online search engine queries. The song would go on to sell over a million copies and become certified platinum.

In November 2022, the Tom Ford brand was purchased by Estée Lauder for $2.8 billion. &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Ford would earn $1.1 billion from the deal. The following April, Ford stepped down as the brand&#x27;s creative director and was succeeded by designer Peter Hawkings.

=== Controversies ===
Ford has been criticized for using naked women in various ad campaigns. Various journalists asserted that the ads were vulgar, sexist, or objectified women. One ad featured a nude woman holding a bottle of the perfume between her legs. Another featured a naked woman ironing a man&#x27;s pants while he read a newspaper. A separate ad was banned in Italy.

Responding to criticism that he objectified women, Ford stated he is an &quot;equal opportunity objectifier&quot; and is &quot;just as happy to objectify men&quot;. He argued &quot;you can&#x27;t show male nudity in our culture in the way you can show female nudity&quot; and pointed out that he did a male nude ad while at Yves Saint Laurent which got pulled.

In 2014, Ford released a new product, called the &quot;Penis Pendant Necklace&quot;. The product caused some controversy, with Christians calling it offensive due to the pendant being shaped similar to a Christian cross or crucifix. Ford replied that &quot;it was not meant to be a cross, it was a phallus&quot; and &quot;people read into things what they want to&quot;.

In 2022, Ford criticized the Met Gala, stating the event had &quot;turned into a costume party.&quot;

== Film career ==
=== &quot;A Single Man&quot; ===

In March 2005, Ford announced the launch of his film production company, Fade to Black. In 2009 he made his directorial debut with &quot;A Single Man&quot;, based on the novel of the same name by Christopher Isherwood. The drama stars Colin Firth as an LA-based college professor who is gay, alongside Julianne Moore, Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode. The novel was adapted by David Scearce and Ford; Ford was also one of the producers.

&quot;A Single Man&quot; premiered on September 11, 2009, at the 66th Venice International Film Festival, where it was nominated for top award the Golden Lion. Colin Firth was awarded the Volpi Cup as Best Actor for his performance. He won a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and was nominated for an Academy Award, Golden Globe, Independent Spirit Award and Screen Actors Guild Award. The film won AFI Film of the Year and the GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Film – Wide Release.

Other nominations for the film included two further Golden Globe categories: Julianne Moore for Best Supporting Actress, and Abel Korzeniowski for Best Original Score. At the Independent Spirit Awards, the film was nominated for Best First Feature and Best First Screenplay. Ford and Scearce also received a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards.

=== &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; ===
In 2015, Ford became attached to direct &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot;, an adaptation of the Austin Wright novel &quot;Tony and Susan&quot;. The film was released in 2016. Jake Gyllenhaal and Amy Adams played the lead roles of Tony and Susan, and Michael Shannon, Armie Hammer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Isla Fisher co-starred.

The film received praise from critics, as well as winning the Grand Jury Prize at the Venice Film Festival. The film has an approval rating of 72% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 143 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10, and the site&#x27;s critical consensus reading: &quot;Well-acted and lovely to look at, &quot;Nocturnal Animals&quot; further underscores writer-director Tom Ford&#x27;s distinctive visual and narrative skill.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Ford is openly gay, and married Richard Buckley in 2014, a journalist and former editor in chief of &quot;Vogue Hommes International&quot;; they had been in a relationship since meeting in 1986. The couple have a son who was born in September 2012 via gestational surrogate. The family lived in Italy, where Ford moved from New York in 1990, and in London for 17 years. They lived in his residences in New York, Los Angeles, Santa Fe, and London. Ford and Buckley have owned smooth fox terriers, which have appeared on the runway and in his film &quot;A Single Man&quot;. Ford also has two nephews and a niece, the children of his sister Jennifer.

Ford constructed a 24,000-acre private tract designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando, in Santa Fe. It is called Cerro Pelon Ranch and has additional structures that were designed by Marmol Radziner. The property also has a fictional town known as Silverado that is used as a filming location for Western movies.

He told &quot;Vogue&quot; he had adopted a vegan diet after viewing the Netflix documentary called &quot;What the Health&quot;. As of 2019, he has been a teetotaler and has been open about using fillers and Botox.

He has said in multiple interviews that his first lover was the late artist Ian Falconer, who went on to write and illustrate the very popular Olivia the Pig children&#x27;s book series. Ford maintains that he and Falconer remained good friends until Falconer&#x27;s death in 2023; decades after their breakup, Ford lent Falconer&#x27;s last name to the title character of his first movie, &quot;A Single Man&quot; (in the source novel the character originally only had a first name).

Richard Buckley died on September 19, 2021, at the age of 72 after a long illness.

In 2024, Ford purchased a mansion in London&#x27;s Chelsea district for £80 million (approximately $104 million), which was the UK&#x27;s most expensive residential real estate transaction of the year. Ford&#x27;s real estate portfolio is valued at over $300 million and includes properties such as the Hamptons estate once owned by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a Palm Beach mansion.

=== Politics ===
Ford is a Democrat. He opposed the United States&#x27; invasion of Iraq in 2003, stating that it made him feel &quot;ashamed to be an American&quot;. His comment drew public criticism within America. He hosted a fundraiser for Barack Obama. He voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US general election.

Ford has advocated for federal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States. In a 2009 interview, he said he preferred the term &quot;civil partnership&quot; for both opposite-sex and same-sex partnerships, and to leave &quot;marriage&quot; to religion to decide.

Ford maintains a policy of not dressing politicians regardless of party.

I think that whoever is the President, or the First Lady, should be wearing clothes at a price point that are accessible to most Americans, and wearing clothes made in America. My clothes are made in Italy, they&#x27;re very, very expensive. I don&#x27;t think most women or men in our country can relate to that, and I think the First Lady or the President should represent all people.

Ford considers &quot;obsession with political correctness&quot; as something which negatively impacts modern fashion designers. He has stated that &quot;Cancel culture inhibits design because rather than feeling free, the tendency is to start locked into a set of rules. Everything is now considered appropriation. We used to be able to celebrate other cultures. Now you can&#x27;t do that.&quot;

== Public image and legacy ==
Ford has been included in several best-dressed lists, such as International Best Dressed List, &quot;The Guardian&quot;s &quot;The 50 best-dressed over-50s&quot;, and &quot;British GQ&quot;s &quot;50 Best Dressed Men in Britain 2015&quot;. He was featured on the cover of the 2011 spring/summer issue of &quot;Another Man&quot;, giving his opinion on what makes the modern day gentleman. He has been called a &quot;fashion icon&quot; and a &quot;style icon&quot;, and he was included in &quot;All-&quot;TIME&quot; 100 Fashion Icons&quot; list. He won many awards including several VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards and Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) Awards. In 2014, the CFDA awarded him the Geoffrey Beene Lifetime Achievement Award.

While Ford was in a monogamous relationship for many years, he &quot;continue[d] to promote himself with a youthful and sexually charged image&quot;. He is known for sexy clothes, making provocative statements, and creating racy advertisements. Ford&#x27;s designs convey a &quot;sophisticated sex appeal&quot; and he has been credited for &quot;bringing sexy back&quot;. His advertisement campaigns have drawn controversy for use of nudity and &quot;provocative sexual imagery&quot;. Ford is also known to pose with celebrities and models in his ad campaigns. He has been called the &quot;King of Sex&quot; and &quot;the straightest gay man in the world&quot;.

Ford saved Gucci from near bankruptcy and transformed it into a fashion powerhouse. His decade as the creative director was hailed as a &quot;golden era&quot; for Gucci. He turned the brand around, replacing the &quot;grunge look&quot; with &quot;sexy, yet sophisticated, clothes&quot;. He is known for his bold designs. The &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote &quot;Every season, Ford created an &#x27;It&#x27; piece, a must-have, a season-defining trend, photographed to death, knocked off ad nauseam.&quot; Ford says it is important for designers to be contemporary and current with the changing standard of beauty.

In 2004, Ford published an eponymous monograph, detailing his early career and his design work for Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent from 1990 to 2004. In 2021, seventeen years later, Ford published a follow-up volume entitled &quot;Tom Ford 002&quot;, which described his career from 2005 including the creation of his own fashion label and the production of his two films. Both books are published by Rizzoli International Publications and co-authored by fashion journalist Bridget Foley, with forewords by Anna Wintour.

== In popular culture ==

In September 2013, hip-hop artist Jay-Z released the song &quot;Tom Ford&quot; as a single from his album &quot;Magna Carta Holy Grail&quot;. Ford responded favorably to the song saying, &quot;Who would not be flattered to have an entire Jay-Z track named after them? I mean, [...] it&#x27;s pretty rare that something like that happens. It&#x27;s a kind of validation of one&#x27;s work, as it means that one has really penetrated and made an impact on popular culture.&quot; The song was nominated for 56th Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance in 2014.

Tom Ford was referenced by Swedish rapper Bladee on his 2018 mixtape &quot;Icedancer&quot;.

In the 2021 film &quot;House of Gucci&quot; directed by Ridley Scott, Ford was portrayed by actor Reeve Carney.

<text>My Three Sons is an American television sitcom that aired from September 29, 1960, to April 13, 1972. The series was filmed in black-and-white and broadcast on ABC during its first five seasons, before moving to CBS for the remaining seven seasons, which were filmed in color. &quot;My Three Sons&quot; chronicles the life of widower and aeronautical engineer Steven Douglas (Fred MacMurray) as he raises his three sons.

The series originally featured William Frawley (who had first co-starred with Fred MacMurray 25 years earlier in the film &quot;Car 99&quot;) as the boys&#x27; maternal grandfather and live-in housekeeper, William Michael Francis &quot;Bub&quot; O&#x27;Casey.

In 1965, &quot;Uncle Charley&quot; (William Demarest), playing Bub&#x27;s brother, replaced Frawley in 1965 because of Frawley&#x27;s declining health. 

In September 1965 (when the show moved from ABC to CBS and began to be filmed in color), eldest son Mike (Tim Considine) married fiancée Sally Ann Morrison (Meredith MacRae), and his character was written out of the show. To keep the emphasis on &quot;three sons&quot;, original youngest son Chip&#x27;s (Stanley Livingston) friend Ernie (Barry Livingston, Stanley&#x27;s real-life brother) was adopted. In the program&#x27;s later years, Steven Douglas married Barbara Harper (Beverly Garland) and adopted her young daughter Dorothy Anne (&quot;Dodie&quot;) (Dawn Lyn).

The series was a cornerstone of the ABC and CBS lineups in the 1960s. Disney producer Bill Walsh often mused on whether the concept of the show was inspired by the film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;, as in his view they shared &quot;the same dog, the same kids, and Fred MacMurray&quot;.

A Lawrence Welk cover version of the theme song reached #12 in Canada, April 24, 1961.

==History==
===ABC years===
The show began on ABC in black-and-white. The first season, consisting of 36 episodes, was directed in its entirety by Peter Tewksbury, the Emmy-winning director of &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;, who produced and occasionally scripted the programs.

During the 1964 fall season, William Frawley, who played Bub, was declared too ill to work by Desilu Studios, as the company was informed that insuring the actor would be too costly. Frawley continued in the role until a suitable replacement could be found at midseason. He was replaced by William Demarest, who played his hard-nosed brother (great) Uncle Charley, introduced partway through the 1964–1965 season (the last on ABC). According to the storyline, Bub returns to Ireland to help his Aunt Kate celebrate her 104th birthday. Soon after, brother Charley visits and stays on. Charley, a cello-playing merchant sailor, was a soft-hearted curmudgeon, who proved to be a responsible caregiver. Frawley left the series before the end of the 1964–1965 season. He died March 3, 1966.

The address of the fictional home in Bryant Park was 837 Mill Street. The actual address of the home used for the Bryant Park episodes was 837 5th Avenue in Los Angeles California. Many of the 1960s &quot;My Three Sons&quot; external shoots were actually done on location on 5th Avenue.

===Directors===
Peter Tewksbury directed the first season. The succeeding director, Richard Whorf, took over the reins for one season and was in turn followed by former actor-turned-director Gene Reynolds from 1962 to 1964. James V. Kern, an experienced Hollywood television director who had previously helmed the &quot;Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Europe&quot; episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, continued in this role for two years until his untimely death at 57 in late 1966. Director James Sheldon was also contracted to finish episodes that had been partly completed by Kern to complete that season. Fred De Cordova was the show&#x27;s longest and most consistent director of the series (108 episodes) until he left in 1971 to produce &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. Earl Bellamy rounded out the series as director of the show&#x27;s final year.

===CBS years===
&quot;My Three Sons&quot; moved to the CBS television network for the 1965–1966 season after ABC declined to underwrite the expense of producing the program in color. Along with the change in networks and the transition to color, Tim Considine (who had earlier worked with Fred MacMurray on &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;), playing eldest son Mike, had chosen not to renew his contract due to a clash with executive producer Don Fedderson over Considine&#x27;s wish to direct but not co-star in the series. (Considine did, however, direct one of the last black-and-white episodes for ABC.) In an August 1989 interview on the &quot;Pat Sajak Show&quot;, he explained that he was also devoted to car racing, which his contract forbade. His character was written out, along with Meredith MacRae, who had played his fiancée Sally, in a wedding episode that was the premiere of the 1965–1966 season on CBS. After this episode, Mike is mentioned briefly in only four succeeding episodes (including the one in which the family adopts Ernie) and is never seen again, even at Robbie&#x27;s or Steve&#x27;s weddings. (Steve explains briefly in one of these episodes that he has another son who &quot;lives away from home&quot;.) In the episode &quot;Steve and the Huntress&quot; (first aired January 27, 1966), Mike is specifically mentioned as teaching at a college. MacRae joined &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot; the following year, the last of three actresses to play Billie Jo Bradley.

To keep the show&#x27;s title plausible, the show&#x27;s head writer, George Tibbles, fashioned a three-part story arc in which an orphaned friend of youngest brother Richard (Chip, played by Stanley Livingston), Ernie Thompson (played by his real-life brother, Barry Livingston), awaits adoption when his current foster parents are transferred to the Orient. Steve offers to adopt Ernie, but faces antagonism from Uncle Charley, who finds Ernie a bit grating and forecasts major headaches over both the boy and his dog. It also transpires that a law requires a woman to live in the home of an adoptive family. A likable female social worker supervises the case and the Douglases speculate that Steve might marry the woman to make the adoption possible, but they agree that this is not reason enough for them to be married. Also, the family has no need for a housekeeper; Uncle Charley already has things running smoothly. The family soon appears before a judge who researches the law and determines that its intent is to ensure that a full-time caregiver is in the household. As Charley meets that role and has had a change of heart about Ernie, he assents to a legal fiction that declares him the Douglas family&#x27;s &quot;housemother&quot;.

While the three sons were always central to the storyline, several major changes took place by the late 1960s. In the spring of 1967, the series&#x27; ratings began to sag, and it finished its seventh season in 31st place in the Nielsen ratings. It was decided that the 1967–1968 season would bring the program not only a new time slot but also new storylines to spice up the ratings. In the fall of 1967, CBS moved &quot;My Three Sons&quot; to Saturday at 8:30 pm ET. In the season premiere episode, &quot;Moving Day&quot;, the Douglas family and Uncle Charley relocate from the fictional Midwestern town of Bryant Park to Los Angeles, California. Robbie (Don Grady) marries his girlfriend Katie Miller. Katie is played by Tina Cole, who had appeared in different roles on three previous episodes: &quot;House For Sale&quot; from the fourth season (February 13, 1964), &quot;The Coffee House Set&quot; from the fifth season (November 19, 1964), and &quot;Robbie and the Little Stranger&quot; from the sixth season (February 17, 1966). At the end of the 1967–1968 season, the ratings had improved from the previous year with the series placing at 24th in the Nielsens. The following season, the newlyweds discover that Katie is pregnant and she gives birth to triplets named Robert, Steven, and Charles. Originally played by sets of uncredited twins, the boys were later played uncredited by Guy, Gunnar, and Garth Swanson; and in the last two seasons by Michael, Daniel, and Joseph Todd.

The following year in the 10th season, 1969–1970, Steve remarries. His new bride, widowed teacher Barbara Harper (Beverly Garland), brings with her a five-year-old daughter, Dorothy &quot;Dodie&quot; (Dawn Lyn), whom Steve adopts. Dodie is wary of Steve at first, believing that he wants her to just forget her late father, but he explains that he wants her to always remember and love him, but since he&#x27;s no longer alive, Steve wants to raise her in his place and he hopes she&#x27;ll come to love him, too. The series&#x27; last year and a half feature fewer appearances from both Don Grady and Stanley Livingston. Grady&#x27;s character was written out at the end of the 11th season, which allowed for his wife Katie and their triplet sons to remain in the Douglas household for the following season (as a structural engineer Robbie was working on a bridge construction in Peru). Meanwhile, Chip and his teenage wife Polly (Ronne Troup), who had eloped after Polly&#x27;s disciplinarian father refused to sanction their marriage, move into their own apartment.

At the end of the 1970–1971 season, the show&#x27;s 11th year, &quot;My Three Sons&quot; was still garnering healthy ratings. By the spring of 1971, it had finished in 19th place. A 1971 television pilot with Don Grady and Tina Cole called &quot;Three of a Kind&quot;, then retitled &quot;Robbie&quot;—about Robbie, Katie, and the triplets moving to San Francisco—was filmed but not picked up as a series. The final episode of the 1970–1971 season, &quot;After the Honeymoon&quot;, actually set up the premise for this pilot. Richard X. Slattery and Pat Carroll guest-starred as the landlords of the apartment block into which Robbie and Katie move. However, Don Grady had informed the producers of his intention to leave the series and pursue a new full-time career as a composer, which he ultimately did.

For the series&#x27; 12th and, ultimately, final season, CBS moved the show to Mondays at 10:00 pm ET. In addition to the time changes for the 12th season, a new four-part story arc is introduced with MacMurray in a second role, that of his cousin, the Laird (Lord) Fergus McBain Douglas of Sithian Bridge; English actor Alan Caillou&#x27;s voice was dubbed over MacMurray&#x27;s. The plot centers on Lord Douglas&#x27;s arrival in Los Angeles from the family&#x27;s native Scotland, in search of a bride to take back to Scotland with him.

He finds Terri Dowling (Anne Francis), a waitress at the Blue Berry Bowling Alley. While initially reluctant to give up her life in America and return to Scotland as nobility, she finally accepts. This storyline continues a plot idea that originally began in the fourth season, when the Douglases visited Scotland on the pretense of having been told they had inherited a castle in the Highlands.

With a later time slot, the show finished the season outside the top 30. To save the series, CBS moved it in midseason back to Thursdays at 8:30 pm ET, its old time slot. Nevertheless, &quot;My Three Sons&quot; ended its primetime run in the spring of 1972 after 12 years on the air. CBS also aired daytime reruns starting in December 1971 (only the CBS color shows), for about one season, first airing at 10:30 a.m., and then moving to 4:00 p.m. in June 1972.

==Episodes==
&quot;My Three Sons&quot; had 36 episodes each in the first two seasons. The series had at least thirty episodes in each of the first eight seasons; the episode output then decreased by two episodes until the eleventh season, which had twenty-four episodes, along with the twelfth season. The first five seasons were filmed in black-and-white, and then after the move to CBS, it was filmed in color for the remainder of its run.

==Production==
The series was initially filmed at Desilu Studios in Hollywood, but at the start of the 1967–68 season, the cast and crew began filming the series at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, California. The reasons behind this move concerned the sale of actress-comedienne Lucille Ball&#x27;s studios to the Gulf + Western conglomerate, which owned Paramount Pictures. Don Fedderson Productions, which produced &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (along with &quot;Family Affair&quot; starring Brian Keith), had to quickly make other arrangements for filming.

==Distribution==
Although Don Fedderson gets the credit, &quot;My Three Sons&quot; was created by George Tibbles and produced by Don Fedderson Productions throughout the show&#x27;s run, with MCA Television co-distributing the series during its 1960–65 ABC airing. When the series moved to CBS in 1965, the latter network assumed full production responsibilities (in association with Fedderson Productions) until the end of the series in 1972. CBS now holds the series&#x27; copyright. CBS Media Ventures currently owns distribution rights to the entire series (including the more widely seen and aforementioned 1965–72 CBS episodes). The show did not get syndicated until September 1976, when Viacom Enterprises assumed off-network distribution (although CBS did air reruns of the show in its daytime lineup from December 1971 until the fall of 1972), and even then, only the CBS color episodes aired, while the black and white ABC episodes did not air on broadcast TV at all. At the time, the first half of season 11 was in the same syndication package as seasons 6-10, while season 12 and the second half of season 11 were distributed with seasons 1–5.

Nick at Nite aired &quot;My Three Sons&quot; from November 3, 1985, to October 28, 1991, with episodes from Seasons 1–5, the second half of season 11, and season 12. The Family Channel also aired only the black and white episodes from September 7, 1992, to July 30, 1993. The Seasons 1–3 episodes had the original Chevrolet closing credits. The Seasons 6–10 (and the first half of season 11) episodes were later aired on TV Land in the late 1990s. Odyssey ran all of the color episodes in the early 2000s. They also briefly aired the black and white episodes. In 2000, TV Land briefly aired the black &amp; white episodes again, using the same syndication episode rights that were on Nick at Nite during the 1980s. In 2006 the Retro Television Network broadcast the show. Only seasons 6-10 and the first half of season 11 were aired.

In 2009, FamilyNet began airing the program as a lead-in for its &quot;Happy Days&quot; and &quot;Family Ties&quot; program block, which ended in February 2010. From 2012 to 2014, and also from October 2015 to February 2016, MeTV aired the Season 6-10 episodes in heavy rotation, and most closing credits included the original sponsor tags, such as those for Kellogg&#x27;s. In 2016, Decades began airing the CBS (color) episodes in its &quot;binge&quot; blocks on some weekends.

MeTV began airing the black and white episodes on May 29, 2017, the first time the black and white episodes had aired on broadcast television since their original ABC airings. MeTV aired all episodes in order until August 3, 2018, when the series&#x27;s last episode aired. This marked the first time a U.S. television station aired the entire series in full. MeTV started reairing the entire series again on August 6, 2018 and had continued to do so until May 27, 2024, when &quot;The Flintstones&quot; (later &quot;Adam-12&quot;) replaced it. Additionally, Catchy Comedy (previously Decades) aired a &quot;Catchy Binge&quot; of the series on the weekends of September 9-10, 2023 and August 10-11, 2024. Catchy would later add the show to its weekday lineup on October 28, 2024, and also joined its new Saturday lineup on January 4, 2025, as part of their &quot;Catchy Families&quot; block. It also currently airs on FETV as of February 3, 2025.

==Reunion special==

MacMurray and most of the cast took part in &quot;Thanksgiving Reunion with The Partridge Family and My Three Sons&quot;, which aired on ABC on November 25, 1977. The retrospective special looked back at the history of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (other than featuring single parents with a large family, the two series had no narrative, or even a studio, link). The special was notable for featuring footage from early black and white episodes of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; that, at this point in time, were not in syndication. While most of the collected casts gathered in a studio to reminisce, Demarest appeared in a brief pre-taped segment.

==Home media==
CBS DVD (distributed by Paramount) has released the first five seasons of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

In most episodes, the soundtrack was edited to remove the background musical score, which were originally stock music from the Capitol Records library; the licensing agreement with Capitol only covered broadcast rights, not home video rights, and clearing the music for home video release with the individual composers who worked on the Capitol recordings was deemed cost-prohibitive. The Capitol scores were replaced instead with more modern, synthesized music. The original theme tune by Frank DeVol has been left unaltered; his musical scores in later seasons of the show, written specifically for the series, would less-likely be affected by licensing problems if the later seasons were released on DVD.

On May 13, 2019, the third season was released, in two volume sets, available exclusively through Amazon&#x27;s made-on-demand (MOD) service. Season 4 was released on September 10, 2019 and season 5 on December 17, 2019.

<text>Phar Lap (4 October 1926 – 5 April 1932) was a New Zealand-born champion Australian Thoroughbred racehorse. Achieving great success during his distinguished career, his initial underdog status gave people hope during the early years of the Great Depression. He won the Melbourne Cup, two Cox Plates, the Australian Derby, and 19 other weight-for-age races. He is universally revered as one of the greatest race horses of all time, not just in Australia but in the history of Thoroughbred horse racing.

One of his greatest performances was winning the Agua Caliente Handicap in Mexico in track-record time in his final race. He won in a different country, after a bad start many lengths behind the leaders, with no training before the race, and he split his hoof during the race.

After a sudden and mysterious illness, Phar Lap died in 1932 in Menlo Park, California. At the time, he was the third-highest stakes-winner in the world. His mounted hide is displayed at the Melbourne Museum, his skeleton at the Museum of New Zealand, and his heart at the National Museum of Australia.

==Name==
The name Phar Lap derives from the common Zhuang and Thai word for lightning: ฟ้าแลบ , literally &#x27;sky flash&#x27;. 

Phar Lap was called &quot;The Wonder Horse,&quot; &quot;The Red Terror,&quot; and &quot;Big Red&quot; (the latter nickname was also given to two of the greatest United States racehorses, Man o&#x27; War and Secretariat). He was affectionately known as &quot;Bobby&quot; to his strapper Tommy Woodcock He was also sometimes referred to as &quot;Australia&#x27;s Wonder Horse.&quot;

According to the Museum of Victoria, Aubrey Ping, a medical student at the University of Sydney, suggested &quot;Farlap&quot; as the horse&#x27;s name. Ping knew the word from his father, a Zhuang-speaking Chinese immigrant. Phar Lap&#x27;s trainer Harry Telford liked the name, but changed the F to PH to create a seven letter word, which was split in two in keeping with the dominant naming pattern of Melbourne Cup winners.

== Early life ==
A chestnut gelding, Phar Lap was foaled on 4 October 1926 in Seadown near Timaru in the South Island of New Zealand. He was sired by Night Raid from Entreaty by Winkie. He was by the same sire as the Melbourne Cup winner Nightmarch. Phar Lap was a brother to seven other horses, Fortune&#x27;s Wheel, Nea Lap (won 5 races), Nightguard, All Clear, Friday Night, Te Uira and Raphis, none of which won a principal (stakes) race. He was a half-brother to another four horses, only two of which were able to win any races at all.

Sydney trainer Harry Telford persuaded American businessman David J. Davis to buy the colt at auction, based on his pedigree. Telford&#x27;s brother Hugh, who lived in New Zealand, was asked to bid up to 190 guineas at the 1928 Trentham Yearling Sales. When the horse was obtained for a mere 160 guineas, he thought it was a great bargain until the colt arrived in Australia. The horse was gangly, his face was covered with warts, and he had an awkward gait. Davis was furious when he saw the colt as well, and refused to pay to train the horse. Telford had not been particularly successful as a trainer, and Davis was one of his few remaining owners. To placate Davis, he agreed to train the horse for nothing, in exchange for a two-thirds share of any winnings. Telford leased the horse for three years and was eventually sold joint ownership by Davis.

Although standing a winning racehorse at stud could be quite lucrative, Telford gelded Phar Lap anyway, hoping the colt would concentrate on racing.

== Racing career ==
Phar Lap finished last in the first race and did not place in his next three races. He won his first race on 27 April 1929, the Maiden Juvenile Handicap at Rosehill, ridden by Jack Baker of Armidale, a 17-year-old apprentice. He didn&#x27;t race for several months but was then entered in a series of races, in which he moved up in class. Phar Lap took second in the Chelmsford Stakes at Randwick on 14 September 1929, and the racing community started treating him with respect. He won the Rosehill Guineas by three lengths on 21 September 1929, ridden by James L. Munro.

As his achievements grew, there were some who tried to halt his progress. Criminals tried to shoot Phar Lap on the morning of Saturday 1 November 1930 after he had finished track work. They missed, and later that day he won the Melbourne Stakes, and three days later the Melbourne Cup as odds-on favourite at 8 to 11.

In the four years of his racing career, Phar Lap won 37 of 51 races he entered, including the Melbourne Cup, being ridden by Jim Pike, in 1930 with 9 st 12 lb (). In that year and 1931, he won 14 races in a row. From his win as a three-year-old in the VRC St. Leger Stakes until his final race in Mexico, Phar Lap won 32 of 35 races. In the three races that he did not win, he ran second on two occasions, beaten by a short head and a neck, and in the 1931 Melbourne Cup he finished eighth when carrying 10 st 10 lb ().

Phar Lap at the time was owned by American businessman David J. Davis and leased to Telford. After their three-year lease agreement ended, Telford had enough money to become joint owner of the horse. Davis then had Phar Lap shipped to North America to race. Telford did not agree with this decision and refused to go, so Davis, who along with his wife traveled to Mexico with him, brought Phar Lap&#x27;s strapper Tommy Woodcock as his new trainer. Phar Lap was shipped by boat to Agua Caliente Racetrack near Tijuana, Mexico, to compete in the Agua Caliente Handicap, which was offering the largest prize money ever offered in North America racing. Phar Lap won in track-record time while carrying 129 pounds (58.5 kg). The horse was ridden by Australian jockey Billy Elliot for his seventh win from seven rides. From there, the horse was sent to a private ranch near Menlo Park, California, while his owner negotiated with racetrack officials for special race appearances.

== Death ==
Early on 5 April 1932, the horse&#x27;s strapper for the North American visit, Tommy Woodcock, found him in severe pain and with a high temperature. Within a few hours, Phar Lap haemorrhaged to death. An autopsy revealed that the horse&#x27;s stomach and intestines were inflamed, leading many to believe the horse had been deliberately poisoned. There have been alternative theories, including accidental poisoning from lead insecticide and a stomach condition. It was not until the 1980s that the infection could be formally identified.

In 2000, equine specialists studying the two necropsies concluded that Phar Lap probably died of duodenitis-proximal jejunitis, an acute bacterial gastroenteritis.

In 2006, Australian Synchrotron Research scientists said it was almost certain Phar Lap was poisoned with a large single dose of arsenic in the hours before he died, perhaps supporting the theory that Phar Lap was killed on the orders of US gangsters, who feared the Melbourne Cup-winning champion would inflict big losses on their illegal bookmakers. No real evidence of involvement by a criminal element exists, however.

Sydney veterinarian Percy Sykes believes deliberate poisoning did not cause the death. He said &quot;In those days, arsenic was quite a common tonic, usually given in the form of a solution (Fowler&#x27;s Solution)&quot;, and suggests this was the cause of the high levels. &quot;It was so common that I&#x27;d reckon 90 percent of the horses had arsenic in their system.&quot;

In December 2007, Phar Lap&#x27;s mane was tested for multiple doses of arsenic which, if found, would point to accidental poisoning.

In April 2008, an 82-page handwritten notebook belonging to Telford and containing recipes for tonics given to Phar Lap in the days before swabbing was sold by a Melbourne auction house. It showed that Phar Lap was given tonics designed to boost his performance that included arsenic, strychnine, cocaine and caffeine. The find gave credence to Woodcock&#x27;s deathbed admission in 1985 that Phar Lap may have been given an overdose of a tonic before the horse died in 1932. The notebook was sold to the Melbourne Museum for $37,000.

On 19 June 2008, the Melbourne Museum released the findings of the forensic investigation conducted by Ivan Kempson, University of South Australia, and Dermot Henry, Natural Science Collections at Museum Victoria. Kempson analysed six hairs from Phar Lap&#x27;s mane at the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory near Chicago. These high resolution X-rays detect arsenic in hair samples, showing the specific difference &quot;between arsenic, which had entered the hair cells via the blood and arsenic which had infused the hair cells by the taxidermy process when he was stuffed and mounted at the museum&quot;.

Kempson and Henry discovered that in the 30 to 40 hours before Phar Lap&#x27;s death, the horse ingested a massive dose of arsenic. &quot;We can&#x27;t speculate where the arsenic came from, but it was easily accessible at the time&quot;, Henry said.

In October 2011 the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; published an article in which a New Zealand physicist and information from Phar Lap&#x27;s strapper state that the great horse was never given any tonic with arsenic and that he died of an infection. Said Putt, &quot;Unless we are prepared to say that Tommy Woodcock was a downright liar, which even today, decades after the loveable and respected horseman&#x27;s death, would ostracise us with the Australian racing public, we must accept him on his word. The ineluctable conclusion we are left with, whether we like it or not, is that Phar Lap&#x27;s impeccable achievements here and overseas were utterly tonic, stimulant, and drug-free.&quot;

Contradicting this is the tonic book of Harry Telford, Phar Lap&#x27;s owner and trainer, on display in Museum Victoria, Melbourne. One recipe for a &quot;general tonic&quot; has a main ingredient of arsenic and has written below it: &quot;A great tonic for all horses&quot;. Several theories have been proposed for the large amount of arsenic in Phar Lap&#x27;s body.

==Legacy==

Following his death, Phar Lap&#x27;s heart was donated to the Institute of Anatomy in Canberra and his skeleton to the New Zealand&#x27;s National Museum in Wellington. After preparations of the hide by New York City taxidermist Louis Paul Jonas, Phar Lap&#x27;s stuffed body was placed in the Australia Gallery at Melbourne Museum. The hide and the skeleton were put on exhibition together when Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa lent the skeleton to the Melbourne Museum in September 2010 as part of celebrations for the 150th running of the 2010 Melbourne Cup.

Phar Lap&#x27;s heart was remarkable for its size, weighing , compared with a normal horse&#x27;s heart at . Now held at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra, it is the object visitors most often request to see. The author and film maker Peter Luck was convinced the heart is a fake. In Luck&#x27;s 1979 television series &quot;This Fabulous Century&quot;, the daughter of Walker Neilson, the government veterinarian who performed the first post-mortem on Phar Lap, says her father told her the heart was necessarily cut to pieces during the autopsy, and the heart on display is that of a draughthorse. However the expression &quot;a heart as big as Phar Lap&quot; to describe a very generous or courageous person became a popular idiom.

Several books and films have featured Phar Lap, including the 1983 film &quot;Phar Lap&quot;, and the song &quot;Phar Lap—Farewell To You&quot;.

Phar Lap was one of five inaugural inductees into both the Australian Racing Hall of Fame and New Zealand Racing Hall of Fame. In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the Top 100 U.S. Thoroughbred champions of the 20th century, Phar Lap was ranked No. 22.

The horse is considered to be a national icon in both Australia and New Zealand. In 1978 he was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Australia Post and features in the Australian citizenship test.

Phar Lap has been honoured with a $500,000 life-sized bronze memorial near his birthplace in Timaru, New Zealand, that was unveiled on 25 November 2009. The statue is located at the entrance to Phar Lap Raceway in Washdyke. There is also a life-sized bronze statue at Flemington Racecourse in Melbourne. 

Phar Lap has several residential streets named after him in Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. (In many cases, the name is merged into a single word &quot;Pharlap&quot;.)

In 1931, Gilbert Percy Whitley, an ichthyologist at the Australian Museum, proposed a new genus of seahorse, &quot;Farlapiscis&quot;, named after Phar Lap. &quot;Farlapiscis&quot; was subsequently categorized as a junior synonym of the genus &quot;Hippocampus&quot;.

<doc id="174004" wikidata="Q272119" url="?curid=174004" title="Étienne Bonnot de Condillac">
<text>Étienne Bonnot de Condillac ( ; ; 30 September 1714 – 2 August or 3 August 1780) was a French philosopher, epistemologist, and Catholic priest, who studied in such areas as psychology and the philosophy of the mind.

==Biography==
He was born at Grenoble into a legal family, the youngest of three brothers. His two older brothers Jean and Gabriel took names associated with one of the family&#x27;s properties at Mably, Loire, and were each known as &quot;Bonnot de Mably&quot;. Étienne identified with another property at Condillac, Drôme, was known as &quot;Bonnot de Condillac&quot;. Like his brother Gabriel, Condillac took holy orders (1733–1740) at Saint-Sulpice church in Paris. He was appointed as Abbot of Mureau.
Condillac devoted his whole life, with the exception of an interval as a court-appointed tutor to the court of Parma, to speculative thought. His works are:

* &quot; (1746); 
* &quot; (1749); 
* &quot; (1754); 
*&quot; (1755); 
* a comprehensive &quot;Cours d&#x27;études&quot; (1767–1773) in 13 vols., written for the young Duke Ferdinand of Parma, a grandson of Louis XV; 
* &quot;&quot; (1776); and two posthumous works, 
* &#x27; (1781) and the unfinished &#x27; (1798).

In Paris, Condillac was involved with the circle of Denis Diderot, the philosopher who was co-contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. He developed a friendship with Jean-Jacques Rousseau, which lasted in some measure to the end of his life. It likely started when Rousseau was a tutor to two of his brother Jean&#x27;s sons in Lyon—Jean Bonnot de Mably was then provost of the police and known as Monsieur de Mably.

Condillac&#x27;s relations with unorthodox philosophers did not injure his career. He had already published several works when the French court sent him to Parma to educate the orphan duke, then a child of seven years.

On his return from Italy, Condillac was elected to the Académie française in 1768. Contrary to the popular idea that he attended only one meeting, he was a frequent attendee until two years before his death. He spent his later years in retirement at Flux, a small property which he had purchased near Beaugency on the river Loire. He died there on 2 or 3 August 1780.

==Work==
Condillac is important both as a psychologist and as having established systematically in France the principles of John Locke. Voltaire had made the English philosopher fashionable. Condillac developed his concept of empirical sensationism, and demonstrated &quot;lucidity, brevity, moderation, and an earnest striving after logical method.&quot;

His first book, the &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;origine des connaissances humaines&quot;, keeps close to his English master. He accepts with some reluctance Locke&#x27;s deduction of our knowledge from two sources, sensation and reflection. He uses as his main principle of explanation the association of ideas.

His next book, the &quot;Traité des systèmes&quot;, is a vigorous criticism of those modern systems which are based upon abstract principles or upon unsound hypotheses. His polemic, which is inspired throughout by Locke, is directed against the innate ideas of the Cartesians, Malebranche&#x27;s faculty-psychology, Leibniz&#x27;s monadism and pre-established harmony, and, above all, against the conception of substance set forth in the first part of the &quot;Ethics&quot; of Baruch Spinoza.

By far the most important of his works is the &quot;Traité des sensations&quot;, in which Condillac treats psychology in his own characteristic way. He questioned Locke&#x27;s doctrine that the senses give us intuitive knowledge of objects, that the eye, for example, naturally judges shapes, sizes, positions, and distances. He believed it was necessary to study the senses separately, to distinguish precisely what ideas are owed to each sense, to observe how the senses are trained, and how one sense aids another. He believed that the conclusion has to be that all human faculty and knowledge are transformed sensation only, to the exclusion of any other principle, such as reflection.

The author imagines a statue organized inwardly like a man, animated by a soul which has never received an idea, into which no sense-impression has ever penetrated. He unlocks its senses one by one, beginning with smell, as the sense that contributes least to human knowledge. At its first experience of smell, the consciousness of the statue is entirely occupied by it; and this occupancy of consciousness is attention. The statue&#x27;s smell-experience will produce pleasure or pain; and pleasure and pain will thenceforward be the master-principle which, determining all the operations of its mind, will raise it by degrees to all the knowledge of which it is capable. The next stage is memory, which is the lingering impression of the smell experience upon the attention: &quot;memory is nothing more than a mode of feeling.&quot; From memory springs comparison: the statue experiences the smell, say, of a rose, while remembering that of a carnation; and &quot;comparison is nothing more than giving one&#x27;s attention to two things simultaneously.&quot; And &quot;as soon as the statue has comparison it has judgment.&quot; Comparisons and judgments become habitual, are stored in the mind and formed into series, and thus arises the powerful principle of the association of ideas. From comparison of past and present experiences in respect of their pleasure-giving quality arises desire; it is desire that determines the operation of our faculties, stimulates the memory and imagination, and gives rise to the passions. The passions, also, are nothing but sensation transformed.

These indications will suffice to show the general course of the argument in the first section of the &quot;Traité des sensations&quot;. He thoroughly developed this idea through the subsequent chapters: &quot;Of the Ideas of a Man limited to the Sense of Smell,&quot; &quot;Of a Man limited to the Sense of Hearing,&quot; &quot;Of Smell and Hearing combined,&quot; &quot;Of Taste by itself, and of Taste combined with Smell and Hearing,&quot; &quot;Of a Man limited to the Sense of Sight.&quot;

In the second section of the treatise, Condillac invests his statue with the sense of touch, which first informs it of the existence of external objects. In a very careful and elaborate analysis, he distinguishes the various elements in our tactile experiences-the touching of one&#x27;s own body, the touching of objects other than one&#x27;s own body, the experience of movement, the exploration of surfaces by the hands: he traces the growth of the statue&#x27;s perceptions of extension, distance and shape. The third section deals with the combination of touch with the other senses. The fourth section deals with the desires, activities and ideas of an isolated man who enjoys possession of all the senses; and ends with observations on a &quot;wild boy&quot; who was found living among bears in the forests of Lithuania.

The conclusion of the whole work is that in the natural order of things, everything has its source in sensation, and yet that this source is not equally abundant in all men; men differ greatly in the degree of vividness with which they feel. Finally, he says that man is nothing but what he has acquired; all innate faculties and ideas are to be swept away. Modern theories of evolution and heredity have differed from this.

Condillac&#x27;s work on politics and history, in his &quot;Cours d&#x27;études&quot;, is considered of less interest. In logic, on which he wrote extensively, he is far less successful than in psychology. He enlarges with much iteration on the supremacy of the analytic method; argues that reasoning consists in the substitution of one proposition for another which is identical with it; and lays it down that science is the same thing as a well-constructed language, a proposition which in his &quot;,&quot; he tries to prove by the example of arithmetic. His logic is limited by his study of sensations and lack of knowledge of science other than mathematics. He rejects the medieval apparatus of the syllogism; but is precluded by his standpoint from understanding the active, spiritual character of thought; nor had he that interest in natural science and appreciation of inductive reasoning which form the chief merit of J. S. Mill. Some might claim that Condillac&#x27;s anti-spiritual psychology, with its explanation of personality as an aggregate of sensations, leads straight to atheism and determinism. However, he denies both these consequences. What he says upon religion is always in harmony with his profession; and he vindicated the freedom of the will in a dissertation that has very little in common with the &#x27; to which it is appended. The common reproach of materialism should certainly not be made against him. He always asserts the substantive reality of the soul; and in the opening words of his &#x27;, &quot;Whether we rise to heaven, or descend to the abyss, we never get outside ourselves—it is always our own thoughts that we perceive,&quot; we have the subjectivist principle that forms the starting-point of Berkeley.

==Language==
Condillac promoted &quot;sensationalism,&quot; a theory that says all knowledge comes from the senses and there are no innate ideas. Condillac promoted an expressionist theory of linguistic creation that anticipates the prime features of later thoughts about language by German theorist Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803).

==Economics==
Condillac&#x27;s &quot;Le Commerce et le Gouvernement&quot; (published in 1776, the same year as Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;Wealth of Nations&quot;) attempted to place economics in a coherent logical framework. He was a friend of François Quesnay – leader of the Physiocrats. Much of Condillac&#x27;s work reflected mainstream Physiocrats, particularly his analysis of the structure of taxation and proposals for the revival of the economy, but he also proposed another line of argument, claiming that producers work to obtain utility. Most physiocrats rejected utility and the idea was ignored until his &#x27;rediscovery&#x27; by Stanley Jevons and Carl Menger in 1871.

In his theory of &quot;vrai prix&quot; [true price], Condillac proposed a theory of human history divided into two phases: progress and decline. Progress is marked by a rational development and use of resources; decline is precipitated by bad behavior from the upper classes that then trickles down to the workers, encouraging excess, luxury, and false prices that harm the masses. Condillac saw the remedy to this as &quot;vrai prix,&quot; a true price created by the unimpeded interaction of supply and demand, to be achieved by complete deregulation. People would be taught to work toward their best interest in an open market through a reshaping of their perceptions. By advocating of a free market economy in contrast to the prevailing contemporary policy of state control in France, Condillac influenced classical liberal economics.

==Legacy==
As was fitting to a disciple of Locke, Condillac&#x27;s ideas have had most importance in their effect upon English thought. In matters connected with the association of ideas, the supremacy of pleasure and pain, and the general explanation of all mental contents as sensations or transformed sensations, his influence can be traced upon the Mills and upon Bain and Herbert Spencer. And, apart from any definite propositions, Condillac did a notable work in the direction of making psychology a science; it is a great step from the desultory, genial observation of Locke to the rigorous analysis of Condillac, short-sighted and defective as that analysis may seem to us in the light of fuller knowledge.

His method, however, of imaginative reconstruction was by no means suited to English ways of thinking. In spite of his protests against abstraction, hypothesis and synthesis, his allegory of the statue is in the highest degree abstract, hypothetical and synthetic. James Mill, who stood more by the study of concrete realities, put Condillac into the hands of his youthful son with the warning that here was an example of what to avoid in the method of psychology. A modern historian has compared Condillac with Scottish Enlightenment philosopher and pre-evolutionary thinker Lord Monboddo, who had a similar fascination with abstraction and ideas. In France Condillac&#x27;s doctrine, so congenial to the tone of 18th century philosophism, reigned in the schools for over fifty years, challenged only by a few who, like Maine de Biran, saw that it gave no sufficient account of volitional experience. Early in the 19th century, the romantic awakening of Germany had spread to France, and sensationism was displaced by the eclectic spiritualism of Victor Cousin.

Condillac&#x27;s collected works were published in 1798 (23 vols.) and two or three times subsequently; the last edition (1822) has an introductory dissertation by A. F. Théry. The &#x27; has a very long article on Condillac by Naigeon. Biographical details and criticism of the &#x27; in J. P. Damiron&#x27;s &#x27;, tome iii.; a full criticism in V Cousin&#x27;s &#x27;, ser. i. tome iii. Consult also F Rethoré, &#x27; (1864); L Dewaule, &#x27; (1891); histories of philosophy.

In &quot;Condillac&#x27;s statue&quot;, a chapter in &quot;A Mind So Rare: The evolution of human consciousness&quot;, psychologist and cognitive neuroscientist Merlin Donald argues that Condillac was the first constructivist.

In the short story &quot;Condillac&#x27;s Statue, or Wrens in his Head&quot;, science fiction writer R. A. Lafferty brings the allegory of Condillac&#x27;s statue to life, having Condillac build the statue in a park in the French countryside, and then slowly turning the statue&#x27;s senses on one at a time.

<text>Bohuslav Jan Martinů (; December 8, 1890 – August 28, 1959) was a Czech composer of modern classical music. He wrote 6 symphonies, 15 operas, 14 ballet scores and a large body of orchestral, chamber, vocal and instrumental works. He became a violinist in the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, and briefly studied under Czech composer and violinist Josef Suk. After leaving Czechoslovakia in 1923 for Paris, Martinů deliberately withdrew from the Romantic style in which he had been trained. During the 1920s he experimented with modern French stylistic developments, exemplified by his orchestral works &quot;Half-time&quot; and &quot;La Bagarre&quot;. He also adopted jazz idioms, for instance in his &quot;Kitchen Revue&quot; (&quot;Kuchyňská revue&quot;).

In the early 1930s he found his main fount for compositional style: neoclassicism, creating textures far denser than those found in composers treating Stravinsky as a model. He was prolific, quickly composing chamber, orchestral, choral and instrumental works. His Concerto Grosso and the Double Concerto for Two String Orchestras, Piano and Timpani are among his best-known works from this period. Among his operas, &quot;Juliette&quot; and &quot;The Greek Passion&quot; are considered the finest. He has been compared to Prokofiev and Bartók in his innovative incorporation of Czech folk elements into his music. He continued using Bohemian and Moravian folk melodies throughout his oeuvre, for instance in &quot;The Opening of the Springs&quot; (&quot;Otvírání studánek&quot;).

His symphonic career began when he emigrated to the United States in 1941, fleeing the German invasion of France. His six symphonies were performed by all the major US orchestras. Eventually Martinů returned to live in Europe for two years starting in 1953, then was back in New York until returning to Europe in May 1956. He died in Switzerland in August 1959.

== Life ==

=== 1890–1923: Polička and Prague ===

The setting of Martinů&#x27;s birth was unusual. He was born in the tower of the St. Jakub Church in Polička, a town in Bohemia, close to the Moravian border. His father, Ferdinand, a shoemaker, also worked as the church sexton and town fire watchman. For this, he and his family were allowed to live in the tower apartment. As a small boy Bohuslav was sickly, and frequently had to be carried up the 193 steps to the tower on the back of his father or his older sister. In school he was known to be very shy, and did not participate in the plays or pageants with his classmates. But as violinist, he excelled and developed a strong reputation, giving his first public concert in his hometown in 1905. The townspeople raised enough money to fund his schooling, and in 1906 he left the countryside to begin studies at the Prague Conservatory. 

Whilst there he fared poorly as a student, showing little interest in the rigid pedagogy, nor the hours of violin practice required. He was far more interested in exploring Prague and learning on his own, attending concerts and reading books on many subjects. This was in contrast to his roommate, Stanislav Novák, who was an excellent student and a brilliant violinist. They frequently attended concerts together at which Martinů became engrossed in analysing new music, particularly French impressionist works. He could memorize much of it, to the extent that when back in their room, he could write out large parts of the score almost perfectly. Novák became astonished at how meticulously Martinů could do this. He became convinced that his roommate, while lacking in other subjects, possessed an incredible brain for analysing and memorizing music. 

They became friends for life. Dropped from the violin program, Martinů was moved to the organ department that taught composition, but he was finally dismissed in 1910 for &quot;incorrigible negligence&quot;.

Martinů spent the next several years living back home in Polička, attempting to gain some standing in the musical world. He had written several compositions by this time, including the &quot;Elegie&quot; for violin and piano, and the symphonic poems &quot;Angel of Death&quot; (&quot;Anděl smrti&quot;) and &quot;Death of Tintagiles&quot; (&quot;Smrt Tintagilova&quot;), and submitted samples of his work to Josef Suk, a leading Czech composer. Suk encouraged him to pursue formal composition training, but this would not be possible until years later. In the meantime, he passed the state teaching examination and maintained a studio in Polička throughout World War I, while continuing to compose and study on his own. It was during this time that he studied the ancient choral hymns of the Bohemian Brethren, which would influence his style and musical scope.

As World War I drew to a close and Czechoslovakia was declared an independent republic, Martinů composed the celebratory cantata &quot;Czech Rhapsody&quot; (&quot;Česká rapsodie&quot;), which was premiered in 1919 to great acclaim. He toured Europe as a violinist with the National Theatre Orchestra, and in 1920 became a full member of the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra that was led by the inspired young conductor Václav Talich, who was the first major conductor to promote Martinů. He also began formal composition study under Suk. During these last years in Prague he completed his first string quartet and two ballets: &quot;Who is the Most Powerful in the World?&quot; (&quot;Kdo je na světě nejmocnější?&quot;) and &quot;Istar&quot;.

=== 1923–1940: Paris ===
Martinů finally departed for Paris in 1923, having received a small scholarship from the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education. He sought out Albert Roussel, whose individualistic style he respected, and began a series of informal lessons with him. Roussel would teach Martinů until his death in 1937 by helping him focus and bring order to his compositions, rather than instructing him in a specific style. During his first years in Paris, Martinů incorporated many of the trends at the time, including jazz, neoclassicism, and surrealism. He was particularly attracted to Stravinsky, whose novel, angular, propulsive rhythms and sonorities reflected the industrial revolution, sports events and motorised transportation. Ballets were his favorite medium for experimentation, including &quot;The Revolt&quot; (1925), &quot;The Butterfly That Stamped&quot; (1926), &quot;Le raid merveilleux&quot; (1927), &quot;La revue de cuisine&quot; (1927), and &quot;Les larmes du couteau&quot; (1928). Martinů found friends in the Czechoslovak artistic community in Paris and would always retain close ties to his homeland, frequently returning during the summer. He continued to look to his Bohemian and Moravian roots for musical ideas. His best-known work from this time is the ballet &quot;Špalíček&quot; (1932–33), which incorporates Czech folk tunes and nursery rhymes.

The prime leader of new symphonic music in Paris at this time was Serge Koussevitzky, who presented the biannual Concerts Koussevitzsky (1921–29). He became the conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1924, but still returned to Paris each summer to conduct his Concerts. In 1927, Martinů happened to see him at a café, introduced himself, and gave him the score of a symphonic triptych, &quot;La bagarre&quot;, that was inspired by Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s recent landing. The maestro was impressed, and scheduled its premiere with the Boston Symphony in November 1927.

In 1926, Martinů met Charlotte Quennehen (1894–1978), a French seamstress from Picardy. She was employed at a large garment factory and, after their romance began, she moved into his small flat and helped to support him. She would become an important force in his life, handling the cuisine and business matters that he found trying. They married in 1931. Culturally, however, the two were quite different, a fact that would cause problems in their marriage over the years.

By 1930, Martinů had withdrawn from his seven years of experimentation to settle on a neo-classical style. In 1932, he won the Coolidge prize for the best of 145 chamber music works for his String Sextet with Orchestra. This was performed by Koussevitzsky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1932. Martinu finished his opera &quot;Julietta&quot; in 1936; this was based upon a surrealistic play by Georges Neveux that he had seen in 1927. Its premiere was given in Prague under Václav Talich on 14 March 1938.

In 1937, Martinů became acquainted with a young Czech woman, Vítězslava Kaprálová, who was already a highly accomplished musician when she arrived in Paris, supported by a small Czech government grant to study conducting with Charles Munch and composition with Martinů. Their relationship soon developed beyond that of student-teacher as he fell madly in love with her. After she returned to Czechoslovakia, Martinů wrote her many long, passionate letters. In one of these, he proposed that he would divorce Charlotte and then take her to America. It was while he was in this distraught, frenzied state that Martinů composed one of his greatest works, the Double Concerto for two string orchestras, piano and timpani. It was finished just a few days before the Munich Agreement was sealed (30 September 1938).

After the Munich Agreement, President Edvard Beneš began to form a Czechoslovak government in exile set up in France and England. As a significant number of troops became organized into a Czech resistance force, Martinů tried to join them but was rejected because of his age. However, in 1939, he composed a tribute to this force, the &quot;Field Mass&quot; for baritone, chorus and orchestra. It was broadcast from England and was picked up in occupied Czechoslovakia. For this, Martinů was blacklisted by the Nazis and sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot;. In 1940, as the German army approached Paris, the Martinůs fled. They were sheltered by Charles Munch who had a place near Limoges. Soon, they journeyed on to Aix-en-Provence, where they stayed for six months while trying to find transit out of Vichy France. He was helped by the Czech artistic community, particularly , along with Edmonde Charles-Roux and the Countess Lily Pastré. Despite the harsh conditions, he found inspiration in Aix and composed several works, notably the &quot;Sinfonietta giocosa&quot;. Charlotte wrote: &quot;We fell in love with Aix: the delicate murmur of its fountains calmed our agitated feelings and later Bohus was inspired by them.&quot; Finally, on 8 January 1941, they left Marseilles for Madrid and Portugal, eventually reaching the United States in 1941 with the help of his friend, the diplomat Miloš Šafránek, and especially from Martinů&#x27;s Swiss benefactor, Paul Sacher, the conductor of the Basel Chamber Orchestra, who arranged and paid for their passages.

=== 1941–1953: US ===

Life in the United States was difficult for him initially, just as it was for many other artist émigrés in similar circumstances. Lack of knowledge of English, of funds, and of opportunities to use their talents were common to them. When they first arrived in New York, the Martinůs rented a studio apartment at the Great Northern Hotel on 57th St. They were helped by several musician friends, including pianist Rudolf Firkušný, violinist Samuel Dushkin, cellist Frank Rybka, diplomat Miloš Šafránek, and multi-lingual lawyer . Martinů soon found that he was unable to resume composing in noisy Manhattan, so for the following season they leased a small apartment in Jamaica Estates, Queens, close to the Rybkas. This leafy, residential neighborhood was conducive for him to take long solitary walks at night, during which he would work out music scores in his head. On several occasions he would &quot;zone out&quot; in deep concentration about the music, becoming oblivious of his surroundings and getting lost, and would then call a friend with a car to come find him and take him back home. Thereafter, he began to compose actively. When he contacted Serge Koussevitzsky, the conductor told him that his Concerto Grosso would receive its premiere in Boston the following season. One of the first compositions Martinů wrote in New York was the &quot;Concerto da Camera&quot; for violin and small orchestra, in fulfillment of a commission he had been awarded before the war by Paul Sacher. The following year, they moved back to Manhattan into an apartment in a brownstone on 58th St, across from the Hotel Plaza. That was where they lived for the rest of their years in America. Composer David Diamond, who sub-leased this apartment in 1954, has described it in an interview.

&quot;As the War was coming to an end, the Martinůs encountered marital difficulties. Charlotte, who never did like America, wanted strongly to return to France. He did not, so when he accepted Koussevitzky&#x27;s offer to teach at the Berkshire Music School for the summer of 1946, she went to France alone for a prolonged visit. In Great Barrington, Massachusetts, he was lodged with the students in Searles Castle, and his magnificent master bedroom opened onto a terrace. One night, Martinů took his customary walk on the terrace, a section of which had no railing, and he fell off, landing on concrete, and was hospitalized with a fractured skull and concussion. He drifted in and out of a coma, but survived. After several weeks he was released to recuperate with friends. By this time, Roe Barstow had entered his life. She was an attractive divorcee of independent means, who lived alone in Greenwich Village. With Charlotte away in France, she was at Martinů&#x27;s side, assisting in his recovery, during which their relationship deepened. After Charlotte returned in the late fall, she found that her husband was a different man: gaunt, irritable, crippled and in pain from the accident. It required a few years before he was able to return to his former state as a solid composer.&quot;

Apart from his domestic problems, Martinů was unsure about which country he would live in. He had considered returning to Czechoslovakia as a teacher, despite having a powerful enemy there in the communist politician Zdeněk Nejedlý. Any plans to return were further hampered by the 1948 Czechoslovak &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. With the communists&#x27; seizure of power, music, along with the other arts, became an instrument of propaganda along Soviet ideological lines. Martinů was branded as a formalist and émigré traitor, and he chose wisely not to pursue any kind of professional engagement in his native land from this time forward. Martinů became an American citizen in 1952.

Martinů was indeed reluctant to leave America which had been very supportive of him. He taught at the Mannes College of Music for most of the period from 1948 to 1956. He also taught at Princeton University and the Berkshire Music School (Tanglewood). At Princeton he was warmly received by faculty and students. His six symphonies were written in the eleven-year period 1942–1953, the first five being produced between 1942 and 1946. In addition, he composed the Violin Concerto No. 2, &quot;&quot;
for orchestra, Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, Piano Concerto No. 3, &quot;Concerto da Camera&quot; for violin and small orchestra, &quot;Sinfonietta La Jolla&quot; for piano and small orchestra, Sonatas Nos. 2 and 3 for cello and piano, many chamber compositions, and a television opera, &quot;The Marriage (Ženitba)&quot;. His symphonic scores were performed by most of the major orchestras: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Chicago, and he generally received fine reviews from the leading critics.

Owing to the extraordinary volume of Martinů&#x27;s oeuvre, some critics who never knew the man have stated that he composed too much, too fast, and therefore must have been careless in quality. However, he has been defended strongly by musicians and critics who did know him. Olin Downes knew Martinů better. For his interviews of Martinů, he had the benefit of having Jan Löwenbach, a friend of both men, present as an interpreter. Downes&#x27; defense of the composer came out in an article, &quot;Martinu at 60&quot;. &quot;Martinu […] is incapable of an unthorough or conscienceless job. He works very hard, systematically, scrupulously, modestly. He produces so much music because in the first place, his nature necessitates this. He has to write music. In the second place, he knows his business and loves it.&quot; The composer David Diamond knew Martinů both in Paris and New York. In an interview years later, he expressed amazement at how extraordinary Martinů&#x27;s mind was in developing a whole orchestral score while taking a walk.

Martinů&#x27;s notable students include Burt Bacharach, Alan Hovhaness, Vítězslava Kaprálová, Louis Lane, Jan Novák, H. Owen Reed, Howard Shanet and Chou Wen-chung.

=== 1953–1959: Europe ===
In 1953, Martinů left the United States for France and settled in Nice, and completed his &quot;Fantaisies symphoniques&quot;; the following year he composed &quot;Mirandolina&quot; and piano sonata, and met Nikos Kazantzakis, beginning work on &quot;The Greek Passion&quot;. During 1955 he created several key works: the oratorio &quot;Gilgames&quot; (The Epic of Gilgamesh), the Oboe Concerto, &quot;Les Fresques de Piero della Francesca&quot;, and the cantata &quot;Otvirani studanek&quot; (The Opening of the Wells); Charles Munch conducted the &quot;Fantaisies symphoniques&quot; premiere in Boston which gained the composer the annual New York critics&#x27; prize for the work. In 1956, he took up an appointment as composer-in-residence at the American Academy in Rome and composed &quot;Incantation&quot; (his fourth piano concerto) and much of &quot;The Greek Passion&quot;, which he completed in January the following year.

Jan Smaczny commented that in the compositions of Martinů&#x27;s last years &quot;we find the composer attempting through his music a vicarious homecoming&quot;, although he never returned to Czechoslovakia. His prolific output continued in 1958 with &quot;The Parables&quot; for orchestra and the opera &quot;Ariane&quot;. The following year he attended the first production of &quot;Julietta&quot; since the premiere in Prague, in Wiesbaden. Further composition continued up to his death: the second version of &quot;The Greek Passion&quot;, the Nonet, the Madrigaly, and the cantatas &quot;Mikeš z hor&quot; (Mikeš from the Mountains) and &quot;The Prophecy of Isaiah&quot;, &quot;one of the most striking and most individual of Martinů&#x27;s works&quot;.

He died of gastric cancer in Liestal, Switzerland, on 28 August 1959. His remains were moved and buried in Polička, Czechoslovakia, in 1979.

== Music ==
Martinů was a prolific composer who wrote almost 400 pieces. Many of his works are regularly performed or recorded, among them his oratorio &quot;The Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; (1955, &quot;Epos o Gilgamešovi&quot;), his six symphonies, concertos (these number almost thirty – four violin concertos, eight compositions for solo piano, four cello concertos, one of each for harpsichord, viola, and oboe, five double concertos, two triple concertos, and two concertos for four solo instruments and orchestra), an anti-war opera &quot;Comedy on the Bridge (Veselohra na mostě)&quot;, chamber music (including eight string quartets, three piano quintets, a piano quartet), a flute sonata, a clarinet sonatina and many others.
A characteristic feature of his orchestral writing is the near-omnipresent piano; many of his orchestral works include a prominent part for piano, including his small Concerto for harpsichord and chamber orchestra. The bulk of his writing from the 1930s into the 1950s was in a neoclassical vein, but with his last works he opened up his style to include more rhapsodic gestures and a looser, more spontaneous sense of form. This is easiest to hear by comparing his &quot;Fantaisies symphoniques&quot; (Symphony No. 6), H 343, with its five predecessors, all from the 1940s.

One of Martinů&#x27;s lesser known works features the theremin. Martinů started working on his Fantasia for theremin, oboe, string quartet and piano in the summer of 1944, and finished it on October 1. He dedicated it to Lucie Bigelow Rosen, who had commissioned it and was the theremin soloist at its premiere at New York&#x27;s Town Hall on 3 November 1945, joined by the Koutzen Quartet, Robert Bloom (oboe), and Carlos Salzedo (piano).

His opera &quot;The Greek Passion&quot; is based on the novel of the same name by Nikos Kazantzakis, and his orchestral work &quot;Memorial to Lidice&quot; (Památník Lidicím) was written in remembrance of the village of Lidice that was destroyed by the Nazis in reprisal for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich in the late spring of 1942. It was completed in August 1943 whilst he was in New York, and premiered there in October of that year.

== Personality ==
There have been many discussions about Martinů&#x27;s personality, manners and possible Asperger syndrome. Frank James Rybka promoted the idea that Martinů suffered from this kind of autism spectrum disorder. He met Martinů in 1941, when the composer was 51 and Rybka was only six years old; later on he met him in 1951 and then in 1959, a month before the composer died.

According to Rybka, Martinů was quiet, introverted, and emotionally stolid when meeting persons he did not know well. He typically answered questions very slowly, even when conversing in his native Czech. He might fail to reciprocate socially when people would compliment his music, or do favors for him. Close friends found him to be a kind, gentle, self-effacing, unbiased person. In 2009, Rybka launched a retrospective study of the composer&#x27;s unusual personality, based upon interviews of people who knew him, as well as a study of letters he had written to his family and friends. Evidence of his having an autism spectrum disorder was compiled and evaluated, using the established criteria found in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disease &quot;(DSM-IV). This evidence was reviewed by a well-known autism neuroscientist who concurred that the composer had good evidence of having had an autistic spectrum disorder, most likely Asperger syndrome. This was described in their publication. In 2011, Rybka published a Martinů biography, in which such traits are reviewed, such as his failure of social reciprocity, his flat affect and stolidity, his phobias and extreme stage fright, his strict adherence to a ritualized schedule, and his zoning out into an aura, while walking with his mind deeply engrossed in composing. The biography concludes that there were both positive and negative ways Asperger&#x27;s affected his life. It seems to have facilitated his extraordinary memory for music, and his ability to compose prolifically and skillfully, but it also left him unable to promote or showcase his music in public.

Against this, Erik Entwistle in his review of Rybka&#x27;s publication emphasized three main points contradicting Rybka&#x27;s conclusions. These are: firstly, that it is impossible to diagnose someone so many years after his death; secondly, that Asperger syndrome officially does not exist as a separate syndrome; and finally, that according to Entwistle, Rybka became obsessed with the idea of Martinů&#x27;s disorder, finding evidence for his claim everywhere.

<text>Daniel Raymond Massey (10 October 193325 March 1998) was an English actor and performer. He is possibly best known for his starring role in the British TV drama &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;, as Daniel, alongside Michael Bryant. He is also known for his role in the 1968 American film &quot;Star!&quot;, as Noël Coward (Massey&#x27;s godfather), for which he won a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination.

==Early life==
Massey was born in London in 1933. He was educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He was a member of the noted Massey family, which included his father, Raymond Massey, his sister, Anna Massey and his uncle Vincent Massey, the first Canadian-born Governor General of Canada. His mother was the actress Adrianne Allen.

Living with his mother after his parents&#x27; divorce, Massey rarely saw his father through most of his adult life; however, they were cast as father and son in &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Guards&quot; (1961).

==Career==
Massey made his film debut as a child in his godfather Noël Coward&#x27;s naval drama, &quot;In Which We Serve&quot; (1942). He would later play Coward in the 1968 Julie Andrews vehicle &quot;Star!&quot;, a performance for which he won a Golden Globe Award and received his sole Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor.

He made a major impression as an adult as Laurence Olivier&#x27;s son-in-law in the stage and screen versions of John Osborne&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (film in 1960). Massey appeared in numerous British films from the 1950s onwards, including &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967), &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; (1973, in which his character&#x27;s sister was played by his real-life sister, Anna Massey), &quot;The Cat and the Canary&quot; (1979), &quot;Victory!&quot; (1981) and &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1993).

Other highlights of his career were his stage roles, especially that of the German conductor Wilhelm Furtwängler in Ronald Harwood&#x27;s &quot;Taking Sides&quot;; Massey was nominated for the 1996 Olivier Award as Best Actor. He recreated the role for Broadway in 1996, earning a 1997 Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Actor In A Play. His other Broadway stage appearances included musicals such as &quot;She Loves Me&quot; as Georg in 1963 and &quot;Gigi&quot; (as Gaston) in 1973.

He appeared in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot; as Benjamin Stone in the West End in 1987. In the 1980s and 1990s, he also appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company in productions such as &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; and &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot;, the latter alongside John Thaw.

In 1970 Massey played the role of the openly gay character Daniel, alongside a cast headed by Michael Bryant as Mathieu in the acclaimed multi-part BBC adaptation of Jean Paul Sartre&#x27;s &quot;The Roads to Freedom&quot;.

Other television highlights of Massey&#x27;s career include &quot;The Crucible&quot; on the BBC (1981) as Reverend Hale, &quot;The Golden Bowl&quot; (1972) as the Prince, in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Deceived by Flight&quot; as Anthony Donn, again with John Thaw, the BBC adaptation of Molly Keane&#x27;s novel &quot;Good Behaviour&quot; (1983) as the Major, and his performance as an AIDS patient in &quot;Intimate Contact&quot; (1987). With Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes, he played a US Senator in &quot;The Problem of Thor Bridge&quot;, series 3, episode 2, &quot;The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, Granada Television, 1991. Brett had once been married to Massey&#x27;s sister, Anna, and was father to Massey&#x27;s nephew by Anna, actor David Huggins. He also stole mostly every scene he appeared in the Alan Bleasdale classic &quot;G.B.H.&quot; (1991) as the awkward eccentric hotel owner, Grosvenor.

==Personal life==
Massey was married three times, two of his wives being well-known actresses: 
*Adrienne Corri (1961–1967)
*Penelope Wilton (1975–1984); one daughter, Alice Massey and a stillborn son. 
* Linda Wilton (1986–1998) (a sister of Penelope)

Massey also had a close friendship/relationship with Marilu Henner. The two worked together in 1985 in Italy making the film, &quot;Love with a Perfect Stranger&quot; (1986). Henner wrote she fell for Massey.

==Death==
He died in London, on 25 March 1998 from Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma, which had been diagnosed in 1992. 
 His body was interred at Putney Vale Cemetery. Massey worked in theatre throughout his cancer treatments, rarely missing a performance.

<doc id="174009" wikidata="Q898555" url="?curid=174009" title="Hall–Héroult process">
<text>The Hall–Héroult process is the major industrial process for smelting aluminium. It involves dissolving aluminium oxide (alumina) (obtained most often from bauxite, aluminium&#x27;s chief ore, through the Bayer process) in molten cryolite and electrolyzing the molten salt bath, typically in a purpose-built cell. The process conducted at an industrial scale, happens at 940–980 °C (1700 to 1800°F) and produces aluminium with a purity of 99.5-99.8%. Recycling aluminum, which does not require electrolysis, is thus not treated using this method.

The Hall–Héroult process consumes substantial electrical energy, and its electrolysis stage can produce significant amounts of carbon dioxide if the electricity is generated from high-emission sources. Furthermore, the process generates fluorocarbon compounds as byproducts, contributing to both air pollution and climate change.

==Process==

===Difficulties faced===
Elemental aluminium cannot be produced by the electrolysis of an aqueous aluminium salt, because hydronium ions readily oxidize elemental aluminium. Although a molten aluminium salt could be used instead, aluminium oxide has a melting point of 2072 °C (3762°F) so electrolysing it is impractical. In the Hall–Héroult process, alumina, Al2O3, is dissolved in molten synthetic cryolite, Na3AlF6, to lower its melting point for easier electrolysis. The carbon source is generally a coke (fossil fuel).

===Theory===

In the Hall–Héroult process the following simplified reactions take place at the carbon electrodes:

Cathode:
Anode:
Overall:
In reality, much more CO2 is formed at the anode than CO:

Pure cryolite has a melting point of (1848°F). With a small percentage of alumina dissolved in it, its melting point drops to about 1000 °C (1832°F). Besides having a relatively low melting point, cryolite is used as an electrolyte because, among other things, it also dissolves alumina well, conducts electricity, dissociates electrolytically at higher voltage than alumina, and also has a lower density than aluminum at the temperatures required by the electrolysis.

Aluminium fluoride (AlF3) is usually added to the electrolyte. The ratio NaF/AlF3 is called the cryolite ratio and it is 3 in pure cryolite. In industrial production, AlF3 is added so that the cryolite ratio is 2–3 to further reduce the melting point, so that the electrolysis can happen at temperatures between 940 and 980 °C (1700 to 1800°F). The density of liquid aluminum is 2.3 g/ml at temperatures between 950 and 1000 °C (1750° to 1830°F). The density of the electrolyte should be less than 2.1 g/ml, so that the molten aluminum separates from the electrolyte and settles properly to the bottom of the electrolysis cell. In addition to AlF3, other additives like lithium fluoride may be added to alter different properties (melting point, density, conductivity etc.) of the electrolyte.

The mixture is electrolysed by passing a low voltage (under 5 V) direct current at through it. This causes liquid aluminium to be deposited at the cathode, while the oxygen from the alumina combines with carbon from the anode to produce mostly carbon dioxide.

The theoretical minimum energy requirement for this process is 6.23 kWh/(kg of Al), but it commonly requires 15.37 kWh.

===Cell operation===
Cells in factories are operated 24 hours per day so that the molten material in them will not solidify. Temperature within the cell is maintained via electrical resistance. Oxidation of the carbon anode increases the electrical efficiency at a cost of consuming the carbon electrodes and producing carbon dioxide.

While solid cryolite is denser than solid aluminium at room temperature, liquid aluminium is denser than molten cryolite at temperatures around . The aluminium sinks to the bottom of the electrolytic cell, where it is periodically collected. The liquid aluminium is removed from the cell via a siphon every 1 to 3 days in order to avoid having to use extremely high temperature valves and pumps. Alumina is added to the cells as the aluminum is removed. Collected aluminium from different cells in a factory is finally melted together to ensure uniform product and made into metal sheets. The electrolytic mixture is sprinkled with coke to prevent the anode&#x27;s oxidation by the oxygen involved.

The cell produces gases at the anode. The exhaust is primarily CO2 produced from the anode consumption and hydrogen fluoride (HF) from the cryolite and flux (AlF3). In modern facilities, fluorides are almost completely recycled to the cells and therefore used again in the electrolysis. Escaped HF can be neutralized to its sodium salt, sodium fluoride. Particulates are captured using electrostatic or bag filters. The CO2 is usually vented into the atmosphere.

Agitation of the molten material in the cell increases its production rate at the expense of an increase in cryolite impurities in the product. Properly designed cells can leverage magnetohydrodynamic forces induced by the electrolysing current to agitate the electrolyte. In non-agitating static pool cells, the impurities either rise to the top of the metallic aluminium, or sink to the bottom, leaving high-purity aluminium in the middle area.

===Electrodes===
Electrodes in cells are mostly coke which has been purified at high temperatures. Pitch resin or tar is used as a binder. The materials most often used in anodes, coke and pitch resin, are mainly residues from the petroleum industry and need to be of high enough purity so no impurities end up into the molten aluminum or the electrolyte.

There are two primary anode technologies using the Hall–Héroult process: Söderberg technology and prebaked technology.

In cells using Söderberg or self-baking anodes, there is a single anode per electrolysis cell. The anode is contained within a frame and, as the bottom of the anode turns mainly into CO2 during the electrolysis, the anode loses mass and, being amorphous, it slowly sinks within its frame. More material to the top of the anode is continuously added in the form of briquettes made from coke and pitch. The lost heat from the smelting operation is used to bake the briquettes into the carbon form required for the reaction with alumina. The baking process in Söderberg anodes during electrolysis releases more carcinogenic PAHs and other pollutants than electrolysis with prebaked anodes and, partially for this reason, prebaked anode-using cells have become more common in the aluminium industry. More alumina is added to the electrolyte from the sides of the Söderberg anode after the crust on top of the electrolyte mixture is broken.

Prebaked anodes are baked in very large gas-fired ovens at high temperature before being lowered by various heavy industrial lifting systems into the electrolytic solution. There are usually 24 prebaked anodes in two rows per cell. Each anode is lowered vertically and individually by a computer, as the bottom surfaces of the anodes are eaten away during the electrolysis. Compared to Söderberg anodes, computer-controlled prebaked anodes can be brought closer to the molten aluminium layer at the bottom of the cell without any of them touching the layer and interfering with the electrolysis. This smaller distance decreases the resistance caused by the electrolyte mixture and increases the efficiency of prebaked anodes over Söderberg anodes. Prebake technology also has much lower risk of the anode effect (see below), but cells using it are more expensive to build and labor-intensive to use, as each prebaked anode in a cell needs to be removed and replaced once it has been used. Alumina is added to the electrolyte from between the anodes in prebake cells.

Prebaked anodes contain a smaller percentage of pitch, as they need to be more solid than Söderberg anodes. The remains of prebaked anodes are used to make more new prebaked anodes. Prebaked anodes are either made in the same factory where electrolysis happens, or are brought there from elsewhere.

The inside of the cell&#x27;s bath is lined with cathode made from coke and pitch. Cathodes also degrade during electrolysis, but much more slowly than anodes do, and thus they need neither be as high in purity, nor be maintained as often. Cathodes are typically replaced every 2–6 years. This requires the whole cell to be shut down.

===Anode effect===
The anode effect is a situation where too many gas bubbles form at the bottom of the anode and join, forming a layer. This increases the resistance of the cell, because smaller areas of the electrolyte touch the anode. These areas of the electrolyte and anode heat up when the density of the electric current of the cell focuses to go through only them. This heats up the gas layer and causes it to expand, thus further reducing the surface area where electrolyte and anode are in contact with each other. The anode effect decreases the energy-efficiency and the aluminium production of the cell. It also induces the formation of tetrafluoromethane (CF4) in significant quantities, increases formation of CO and, to a lesser extent, also causes the formation of hexafluoroethane (C2F6). CF4 and C2F6 are not CFCs, and, although not detrimental to the ozone layer, are still potent greenhouse gases. The anode effect is mainly a problem in Söderberg technology cells, not in prebaked.

==History==

===Existing need===
Aluminium is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth&#x27;s crust, but it is rarely found in its elemental state. It occurs in many minerals, but its primary commercial source is bauxite, a mixture of hydrated aluminium oxides and compounds of other elements such as iron.

Prior to the Hall–Héroult process, elemental aluminium was made by heating ore along with elemental sodium or potassium in a vacuum. The method was complicated and consumed materials that were in themselves expensive at that time. This meant that the cost to produce the small amount of aluminium made in the early 19th century was very high, higher than for gold or platinum. Bars of aluminium were exhibited alongside the French crown jewels at the Exposition Universelle of 1855, and Emperor Napoleon III of France was said to have reserved his few sets of aluminium dinner plates and eating utensils for his most honored guests.

Production costs using older methods did come down, but when aluminium was selected as the material for the cap/lightning rod to sit atop the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C., it was still more expensive than silver.

===Independent discovery===
The Hall–Héroult process was invented independently and almost simultaneously in 1886 by the American chemist Charles Martin Hall and by the Frenchman Paul Héroult—both 22 years old. Some authors claim Hall was assisted by his sister Julia Brainerd Hall; however, the extent to which she was involved has been disputed. In 1888, Hall opened the first large-scale aluminium production plant in Pittsburgh. It later became the Alcoa corporation.

In 1997, the Hall–Héroult process was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society in recognition of the importance of the process in the commercialization of aluminum.

===Economic impact===
Aluminium produced via the Hall–Héroult process, in combination with cheaper electric power, helped make aluminium (and incidentally magnesium) an inexpensive commodity rather than a precious metal.

This, in turn, helped make it possible for pioneers like Hugo Junkers to utilize aluminium and aluminium-magnesium alloys to make items like metal airplanes by the thousands, or Howard Lund to make aluminium fishing boats. In 2012 it was estimated that 12.7 tons of CO2 emissions are generated per ton of aluminium produced.

<text>Hurdegaryp () is a village in the northern part of the Netherlands, in the municipality of Tytsjerksteradiel. Its history dates back to at least the 13th century. It had a population of around 4,788 in January 2017.

In Dutch the village is called &quot;Hardegarijp&quot;, Hurdegaryp is its West Frisian and official name.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1401 as Herdegaryp. The etymology is unclear. Originally the centre of the village was located further south. In 1830, the road to Leeuwarden was built. The Hurdegaryp railway station followed in 1866, and the centre of the village moved towards to the road and station.

The Dutch Reformed church was built in 1711 and has a wooden tower. It was a replacement for a 13th century church. Up to 1829, the Grovestins, a fortified tower was located to the south of the village.

Hurdegaryp was home to 624 people in 1840. From the 1960s onwards, it became a suburb of Leeuwarden. In 2017, five tiny houses measuring 3 by 9 metres were built in Hurdegaryp as affordable houses at €50,000.- It was an initiative of a starting real estate agent who himself could not afford to exchange his rented student room with a house. They were immediately sold.

<text>A tattoo machine (colloquially referred to as a tattoo gun) is a hand-held device generally used to create a tattoo, a permanent marking of the skin with indelible ink. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils to move an armature bar up and down. Connected to the armature bar is a barred needle grouping that opens the skin for the ink to flow into. All electromagnetic coil machines are powered by a wired regulated DC power supplies which send an electric current through the copper coils wrapped around opposing magnets and then moves the armature bar up and down. In addition to coil tattoo machines, there are also rotary tattoo machines, which are operated with regulated rotary motors and are powered by a wired external RC power supply or a wireless battery pack attached to the machine. There are many types of rotary machines, some that look similar to coil machines and some that look more like &quot;pens&quot;. Coil machines are usually each tuned for a single function, such as for shading, or lining or packing ink. Rotary machines are multifunctional, taking any size or type of needle or cartridge needle. &quot;The basic machine is pretty much unchanged today, in recent years variations of the theme have crept into the market, namely Manfred Kohrs&#x27; rotary machine of 1978 or Carson Hill’s pneumatic machine that uses compressed air rather than electricity, but the principle is essentially the same.&quot;

==History==

The predecessor to the tattoo machine was Thomas Edison&#x27;s electric pen, patented under the title &quot;Stencil-Pens&quot; in Newark, New Jersey, United States in 1876. It was originally intended to be used as a duplicating device, but in 1891, Samuel O&#x27;Reilly discovered that Edison&#x27;s machine could be modified and used to introduce ink into the skin, and later patented a tube and needle system to provide an ink reservoir.

While O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s machine was based on the tattoo rotary technology of Edison&#x27;s device, modern tattoo machines use electromagnets. The first machine based on this technology was a single coil machine patented by Thomas Riley of London, just twenty days after O&#x27;Reilly filed the patent for his rotary machine. For his machine, Riley placed a modified doorbell assembly in a brass box. The modern two-coil configuration was patented by Alfred Charles South, also of London. Because it was so heavy, a spring was often attached to the top of the machine and the ceiling to take most of the weight off the operator&#x27;s hand.

″To move tattooing forward, German tattoo artist Manfred Kohrs had to take a look backward.″ In 1978, Kohrs &quot;introduced the first new design for a rotary machine in nearly a century. His machine was functionally similar to O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s except an electric DC motor, rather than electrified magnets, drove the needles. This slimmer and streamlined version became lighter, quieter, and more portable. It also gave artists more control while ensuring the operator&#x27;s hands and fingers cramped less. While some artists gravitated to this rotary revival, others preferred to stick with their trusty coil machines.&quot;

Most modern tattoo machines can control needle depth, speed, and force of application, which has allowed tattooing to become a very precise art form. Such advances in precision have also produced a style of facial tattooing that has attained mainstream popularity in America called dermapigmentation, or &quot;permanent cosmetics&quot; creating results such as addition/removal of freckles, beauty spots and scars.

==Classification==
There are many types of machines. Liners and shaders are the more common machines from a technical standpoint. Mechanically, there are coil tattoo machines; also pneumatic machines, and rotary, or linear, tattoo machines.

* Rotary tattoo machines were the original machines, based on rotary technology, which was invented by Samuel O&#x27;Reilly and improved by the tattoo artists through the years. Rotary type machines use an electric motor to drive the needles. Some recent upgrades include using an armature bar to increase efficiency, a characteristic of coil machines. Recently, there have been improvements to make this type of machine pneumatic, in place of the electric motor used now.
* Coil tattoo machines are the most commonly seen and used. These machines use an electromagnetic circuit to move the needle grouping. There are many variations, from single-coiled machines to triple-coiled machines. They can be made from many different materials and in many different sizes and shapes. Dual-coiled machines are considered to be standard. The coils generally range from 8 to 10 wrap. The coils create the impedance, or resistance, used to properly regulate the machine&#x27;s speed and power. This causes less trauma to the skin.
* Liner tattoo machine: The purpose of a liner machine is to lay the ink in the skin in one single pass to create a dominant line. It uses a short contact circuit (about 1.5mm–2mm), which causes the machine to cycle faster.
* Shader tattoo machine: The shader machine is commonly used to shade black or variants of black ink, though colors other than black are also used in this type of machine. The saturation level of this machine is low. It uses a bigger contact gap than a liner (about 2mm–3.5mm) to make it cycle slightly slower. This machine is also used for sculpting lines. Some artists will use this type of machine for all lines, as it allows the lines to be retraced with less trauma to the skin.
* Pneumatic tattoo machine: Tattoo artist Carson Hill in the year 2000 invented the first pneumatic tattoo machine and began the patent process. A pneumatic tattoo machine is powered by an air compressor and is extremely lightweight. Pneumatic tattoo machines use pressurized air to drive the needles up and down. These tattoo machines are easily sterilized as the entire machine can be placed in an autoclave without any major disassembly (unlike traditional coil machines which require complete disassembly before being placed in an autoclave).

Tattoo machines are not limited to just these types. A common variant is having a &quot;cutback&quot;, which uses stiffer front springs. This is more commonly used in liners, but is known to be used on shader machines, more typically for portrait work. Machines are usually categorized into long stroke and short stroke varieties. The longer-stroked machines are good for coloring and shading, as well as sculpting lines, while doing less damage to clients&#x27; skin. Shorter-stroke machines are commonly used for lining in a single pass style, and also in a shader setup to achieve a more subtle gradation of black such as would be found in portraits. Length, width, tension, angle, and stiffness of the spring varies the functionality of the machine. The contact gaps, as well as capacitors and even the style of machine and its angles of deflection, can also all be variants in machine tuning. The proper tuning of the machine is essential for the type of machine being used, also for the type of tattoo the artist is doing.

== Coil machine mechanisms ==
Coil tattoo machines function by passing current through two coils which alternate electromagnetic forces to move the tattoo needle up and down rapidly. Power supplies adapt AC current to power the machine. This allows artists to control the voltage at which their machines operate at and can be manipulated to achieve line variation. Coil machines consist of about fifteen different parts including but not limited to the needle, tube, tube grip, tube clamp, needle bar, armature bar, front spring, contact screw, o-ring, rear spring, rear spring mounting screw, and a yoke. These parts are held together with a frame. Frames are constructed from a wide variety of materials such as brass, iron, steel, zinc, and aluminum. The type of frame used heavily influences the overall operation of the tattoo machine. Some frames (such as those constructed from iron or brass) reduce vibration during operation. Other lighter frames (such as those constructed from aluminum and zinc) reduce the physical strain on artists during operation. Improper frame selection/alignment affect the longevity and quality of a coil machine’s overall function. Coil tattoo machines give artists a high degree of control over every aspect of the machine’s function. This requires artists to be intimately knowledgeable about their machines to efficiently utilize such a device.

== Rotary machine mechanisms ==
Rotary tattoo machines function by using the rotational motion of an electric motor to move a needle/bundle of tattoo needles up and down rapidly. Rotary machines, like coil machines, require a power supply that adapt AC current to power the machine. This voltage may be manipulated to achieve line variation. Rotary machines consist of about seven different parts including but not limited to the grip, tube, cam wheel, “adjustment mechanism”, and a power connection. Rotary machines vary in the type of needle they use. Common rotary machines use standard needles but can also use cartridge needles. This differs from the more traditional “coil tattoo machine” as one rotary machine can be used for both lining and shading. Rotary machines can be purchased pre-aligned and generally work “out of the box”. This makes them more beginner friendly. The electric motor that drives the needle up and down reduces the operational vibration of the machine and thusly reduces the physical strain of tattooing on artists. Rotary machines of all types typically produce less noise and vibration during operation. Coil machines produce a sort of buzzing noise that has commonly been associated with tattooing. Clients sometimes feel more comfortable being tattooed using a rotary machine due to how quiet the machines are. Rotary machines come in a variety of types. Direct drive rotary machines connect the needle bar directly to the motor. Eccentric rotary machines use an eccentric cam drive that converts the rotational movement of the motor to an oscillating motion which in turn drives the needle. Pneumatic rotary machines, as their name implies, utilize compressed air to directly oscillate the tattoo needle and &quot;do not&quot; use an electric motor whatsoever.

<text>Nicolas Malebranche ( ; ; 6 August 1638 – 13 October 1715) was a French Oratorian Catholic priest and rationalist philosopher. In his works, he sought to synthesise the thought of St. Augustine and Descartes, in order to demonstrate the active role of God in every aspect of the world. Malebranche is best known for his doctrines of vision in God, occasionalism and ontologism.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Malebranche was born in Paris in 1638, the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to King Louis XIII of France, and Catherine de Lauzon, sister of Jean de Lauson, a Governor of New France. Because of a malformed spine, Malebranche received his elementary education from a private tutor. He left home at the age of sixteen to pursue a course of philosophy at the Collège de la Marche, and subsequently to study theology at the Collège de Sorbonne, both colleges from the University of Paris. He eventually left the Sorbonne, having rejected scholasticism, and entered the Oratory in 1660. There, he devoted himself to ecclesiastical history, linguistics, the Bible, and the works of Saint Augustine. Malebranche was ordained a priest in 1664.

In 1664, Malebranche first read Descartes&#x27; &quot;Treatise on Man&quot;, an account of the physiology of the human body. Malebranche&#x27;s biographer, Father Yves André reported that Malebranche was influenced by Descartes&#x27; book because it allowed him to view the natural world without Aristotelian scholasticism. Malebranche spent the next decade studying Cartesianism.

===Philosophical career===
In 1674–75, Malebranche published the two volumes of his first and most extensive philosophical work. Entitled &quot;Concerning the Search after Truth. In which is treated the nature of the human mind and the use that must be made of it to avoid error in the sciences&quot; (), the book laid the foundation for Malebranche&#x27;s philosophical reputation and ideas. It dealt with the causes of human error and on how to avoid such mistakes. Most importantly, in the third book, which discussed pure understanding, he defended a claim that the ideas through which we perceive objects exist in God.

Malebranche&#x27;s first critic was the Abbé Simon Foucher, who attacked the &quot;Search&quot; even before its second volume had been published. Malebranche replied in a short preface added to that second volume, and then, in the 1678 third edition, he added 50% to the already considerable size of the book with a sequence of (eventually) seventeen &quot;Elucidations&quot;. These responded to further criticisms, but they also expanded on the original arguments, and developed them in new ways. In the Tenth &quot;Elucidation&quot;, for instance, Malebranche introduced his theory of &quot;intelligible extension&quot;, a single, archetypal idea of extension into which the ideas of all particular kinds of bodies could be jointly resolved. In others, Malebranche placed a greater emphasis than he had previously done on his occasionalist account of causation, and particularly on his contention that God acted for the most part through &quot;general volitions&quot; and only rarely, as in the case of miracles, through &quot;particular volitions&quot;.

Malebranche expanded on this last point in 1680 when he published &quot;Treatise on Nature and Grace&quot;. Here, he made it explicit that the generality of the laws whereby God regulated His behaviour extended not only to His activity in the natural world but also applied to His gift of grace to human beings. The book was attacked by fellow Cartesian philosopher Antoine Arnauld, and, although Arnauld&#x27;s initial concerns were theological ones, the bitter dispute which ensued very quickly branched out into most other areas of their respective systems. Over the next few years, the two men wrote enough polemics against one another to fill four volumes of Malebranche&#x27;s collected works and three of Arnauld&#x27;s. Arnauld&#x27;s supporters managed to persuade the Roman Catholic Church to place &quot;Nature and Grace&quot; on its &quot;Index of Prohibited Books&quot; in 1690, and it was followed there by the &quot;Search&quot; nineteen years later. (Ironically, the Index already contained several works by the Jansenist Arnauld himself.) Other critics with whom Malebranche entered into significant discussion include another fellow Cartesian, Pierre Sylvain Regis, as well as Dortous de Mairan. De Mairan was sympathetic to the views of Baruch Spinoza, and felt that he had found similar views in his reading of Malebranche: Malebranche assiduously resisted such an association.

==Philosophy==
===Vision in God===
Just as all human action (along with the action of any other creature) is entirely dependent on God, so too is all human cognition. Malebranche argued that human knowledge is dependent on divine understanding in a way analogous to that in which the motion of bodies is dependent on divine will. Like René Descartes, Malebranche held that humans attain knowledge through ideas – immaterial representations present to the mind. But whereas Descartes believed ideas are mental entities, Malebranche argued that all ideas exist only in God. These ideas, therefore, are uncreated and independent of finite minds. When we access them intellectually, we apprehend objective truth. Malebranche defined &quot;truth&quot; as a relation between ideas: since these ideas are in God, they are eternal and immutable, and consequently the only truths worthy of the name will themselves be eternal and immutable. Malebranche divided these relations between ideas into two categories: relations of magnitude and relations of quality or perfection. The former constitute &quot;speculative&quot; truths, such as those of geometry, while the latter constitute the &quot;practical&quot; truths of ethics. Ethical principles, for Malebranche, are therefore divine in their foundation, universal in their application, and to be discovered by intellectual contemplation, just as geometrical principles are.

With regard to this account of intellectual knowledge, Malebranche was more or less following Saint Augustine. His great innovation was to explain how these same divine ideas could also serve as the immediate objects of human minds in sensual perception. The problem there is that the divine ideas are universal, whereas all perception seems to be of particulars. Malebranche&#x27;s solution was to suggest that, whereas the mind&#x27;s intellectual conception of these ideas is pure and direct, its sensual perception of them will be modified by &quot;sensations&quot;. These sensations, unlike the ideas, are indeed proper to individual created minds, and subsist as modes thereof. The idea will represent only the geometrical or mechanical properties of bodies (size, shape, motion), while the sensation will consist in colour or some other sensible quality. The latter will limit the mind&#x27;s apprehension of the former in such a manner as to make it represent a particular individual to that mind. To a different mind, one with a different sensation, the same idea could represent a different individual of the same general kind. In the &quot;Dialogues On Metaphysics And Religion&quot; (dialogue 1), Malebranche added that the same basic structure can also account for (the mental as opposed to the physiological element in) imagination, in this case where the idea only &quot;lightly touches&quot; the mind.

Malebranche was strongly influenced by Descartes but did not accept his philosophy uncritically. He is noted particularly for his view that we see all things in God and for his adoption of psycho-physical parallelism and &#x27;occasionalism&#x27; to deal with the problem of interaction between mind and body. However, his attribution of epistemological and explanatory primacy to God leads to difficulties.

(1) If we see all things in God in the sense that He puts the ideas into our minds we can have no direct knowledge of the external world. We can appeal to clear and distinct ideas as a criterion for the veridicality of judgements about physical things, but it is God who is ultimately responsible for our ideas.

(2) If all things are under the direct control of God, subject to His will, what of human freedom? Malebranche&#x27;s view that we have freedom to choose but only in relation to finite goods is not convincing, denying as it does the possibility of resistance of movement towards God as the universal good. (This may be a misrepresentation of Malebranche&#x27;s view; see the first chapter of &quot;The Search for Truth&quot;, where he specifies that while we cannot but desire the good in general, we are free to apply that love to particulars, and can do so in a disordered fashion that leads to sin. His account is no different from St. Augustine&#x27;s in this regard.)

(3) In so far as God is not to be identified with the archetypal eternal truths in his mind, Malebranche is not a pantheist. But, as in mediaeval philosophy, this gives rise to the problem of reconciling God&#x27;s freedom with His supposed immutability.

===Theodicy===
Malebranche&#x27;s theodicy is his solution to the problem of evil. Although he conceded that God had the power to create a more perfect world, free from all defects, such a world would have necessitated a greater complexity in divine ways. Thus, God produces the natural evils that follow from simple laws not because he wills those particular effects, but because he wills a world that best reflects his wisdom by achieving the best possible balance between the intrinsic perfection of the work and the simplicity and generality of its laws.

===Malebranche&#x27;s dualism===
Whereas Malebranche followed Augustine in his description of intellectual knowledge, in his approach to mind–body problems he began as a follower of Descartes. But in contrast to Descartes, who considered it possible to form a clear and distinct idea of the mind, Malebranche argues in the &quot;Dialogues on Metaphysics&quot;, a dialogue between Theodore and Aristes, that we do not have a complete conception of the powers of the mind, and thus no clear conception of the nature of the mind.

I am unable, when I turn to myself, to recognize any of my faculties or my capacities. The inner sensation which I have of myself informs me that I am, that I think, that I will, that I have sensory awareness, that I suffer, and so on; but it provides me with no knowledge whatever of &quot;what&quot; I am – of the nature of my thought, my sensations, my passions, or my pain – or of the mutual relations that obtain between all these things. ...I have no idea whatever of my soul.

This leads Theodore to declare that &#x27;I am not my own light to myself&#x27;; the nature of our own minds is highly obscure. What is more, with regard to psycho-physical interaction, Malebranche argues that body could not act on mind, nor mind on body. The only active power (hence the only efficient cause of change in the world) is God. When I will that my arm should rise, my volition is the &quot;occasion&quot; or the &quot;occasional cause&quot; of the movement of my arm; the efficient cause of both my volition and the movement of my arm is God. Malebranche&#x27;s doctrine, which could be found in contemporary commentaries on Aristotle, and which first appeared in certain Arab philosophers, is therefore called &quot;occasionalism&quot;.

===Occasionalism===
In general, occasionalism is the view that there are no efficient causes in the full sense other than God. Created things are at best &quot;occasions&quot; for divine activity. Bodies and minds act neither on themselves nor on each other; God alone brings about all the phenomena of nature and the mind. Changes occurring in created things will exhibit regularities (and will thus satisfy a Humean definition of causation) because God in creating the world observes what Malebranche calls &quot;order&quot;: he binds himself to act according to laws of nature chosen in accordance with his general will that the world be as good as possible, and thus (for example) that the laws be simple and few in number.

In particular, there will be laws governing what we would customarily call the &quot;interaction&quot; of body and mind, so that similar movements in the body will &quot;occasion&quot; similar ideas in the mind. That relation has some features of the causal relation (it satisfies, for example, universal conditionals of the form &quot;Whenever &quot;C&quot; occurs, &quot;E&quot; occurs&quot;). But in reality both the idea in the mind and the movement in the body are caused by God.

==Scientific contributions==
Although better known for his philosophical work, Malebranche made some notable contributions to physics, working within a broadly Cartesian framework but nevertheless prepared to depart from Descartes where necessary. In 1699, he delivered an address to the Académie Royale des Sciences on the nature of light and color, wherein he argued that different colors resulted out of different frequencies in the pressure vibrations of subtle matter, much as different musical tones derived from different frequencies in the vibrations of air. His theory was presented as a corrective to Descartes&#x27; view, rather than a refutation thereof, but it has important parallels with the rival optical theory of Isaac Newton. Newton had already developed his position some thirty years earlier, but Malebranche probably would not have been aware of it until it was finally published in the &quot;Opticks&quot; of 1704, or, more likely, in its Latin translation of 1706. When Malebranche revised his 1699 paper for inclusion as the Sixteenth &quot;Elucidation&quot; of the 1712 edition of &quot;The Search After Truth&quot;, he inserted a number of references to &quot;Newton&#x27;s excellent work&quot;.

In addition, Malebranche wrote on the laws of motion, a topic he discussed extensively with Leibniz. He also wrote on mathematics and, although he made no major mathematical discoveries of his own, he was instrumental in introducing and disseminating the contributions of Descartes and Leibniz in France. Malebranche introduced l&#x27;Hôpital to Johann Bernoulli, with the ultimate result being the publication of the first textbook in infinitesimal calculus.

Malebranche also developed an original theory related to preformationism, postulating that each embryo probably contained even smaller embryos ad infinitum, like an idealized Matryoshka doll. According to Malebranche, &quot;an infinite series of plants and animals were contained within the seed or the egg, but only naturalists with sufficient skill and experience could detect their presence&quot; (Magner 158–9).

==Legacy==

Aside, perhaps, from John Norris (who, in any case, drew at least as much from Malebranche&#x27;s own sources, primarily Saint Augustine, as he did from Malebranche himself), there are few if any philosophers who can be considered faithful followers of Malebranche in all matters. He was, however, held in widespread high regard within his own lifetime and for some time afterwards, and the influence of certain of his ideas can be discerned in the works of several important figures.

Pierre Bayle regarded Malebranche as &quot;one of the greatest philosophers of this age&quot; (though, admittedly, not as &quot;the&quot; greatest, as is often reported). In note H to his &quot;Zeno of Elea&quot; article, Bayle discussed Malebranche&#x27;s views on material substance with particular approval. Occasionalism and the vision in God seem to make the real existence of material substance redundant. Not only is it unable to be directly perceived, but it cannot actually affect us or anything else in any way at all. Descartes had also maintained that matter was not directly perceivable, but he had argued that the veracity of God could support a proof of its certain existence. Malebranche, however, weakened Descartes&#x27; argument, concluding that, from a philosophical point of view, its existence could only be shown to be probable. Bayle pushed even further down this same path, thereby laying much of the ground work for the immaterialism of George Berkeley. Berkeley, influenced both by Bayle and directly by Malebranche himself, simply took the final step to a full denial of the existence of material substance. (Arthur Collier, who was also influenced directly by Malebranche, and by Norris, made the same move at around the same time as Berkeley did, but, it would appear, entirely independently of him.) Berkeley, admittedly, did reject the theory of vision in God. &quot;It is evident&quot;, he insisted, &quot;that the things I perceive are my own ideas.&quot; But he was influenced by Malebranche&#x27;s occasionalism, even though he excluded the activity of created minds from its domain. In addition, Berkeley agreed with Malebranche, against Descartes, that we could not achieve a clear idea of the mind itself. John Locke had also argued for this, but he had made no distinction between minds and bodies on this point, whereas both Berkeley and Malebranche maintained (each in his own way) that we could have ideas of bodies but not of minds.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (who met Malebranche in Paris in about 1675 and corresponded with him thereafter) also rejected the vision in God, and his theory of pre-established harmony was designed as a new alternative to occasionalism as well as to the more traditional theory of efficient causal interaction. However, in his own theodicy, even if it was somewhat more elaborate than Malebranche&#x27;s, he did at least agree with Malebranche&#x27;s fundamental contention that the simplicity of God&#x27;s ways had to be given as much regard as the world&#x27;s perfection.

David Hume supported and drew upon Malebranche&#x27;s negative arguments to show that no genuine causal connections could be conceived between distinct mundane entities. However, when it came to finding a positive replacement for such causal connections, he turned inwards to the workings of the human mind, instead of turning upwards to God. With regard to this second half of Malebranche&#x27;s occasionalism, Hume wrote:

:We are got into fairy land, long ere we have reached the last steps of our theory. ...Our line is too short to fathom such immense abysses.

Hume&#x27;s empiricist epistemology led him to distrust Malebranche&#x27;s confidence in discovering abstruse metaphysical truths through an intellectual union with God. Likewise, Locke felt that Malebranche&#x27;s metaphysical speculations lacked a proper foundation, and, though ingenious, were ultimately unintelligible. In a somewhat similar manner, Arthur Schopenhauer regarded the theory of vision in God as &quot;explaining something unknown by something even more unknown.&quot;

Locke withheld his &quot;An Examination of P[ère] Malebranche&#x27;s Opinion Of Seeing All Things In God&quot; from publication, &quot;because he looked upon it to be an opinion that would not spread but was like to die of itself, or at least to do no great harm.&quot; Much as Locke predicted, Malebranche&#x27;s reputation outside France (where he always enjoyed high esteem) did begin to diminish during the 18th century, and remained low thereafter. However, over the last three or four decades, Malebranche&#x27;s work has drawn renewed and ever-increasing interest. Several of his works have been translated into English for the first time, as scholars have been reassessing his ideas. Many have begun to argue that the originality and unity of his philosophical system merits him a place alongside such figures as Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz.

The Thomas Taylor translation of the &quot;Search&quot; (1694; second edition 1700) includes material not contained in the Lennon and Olscamp edition (which is based on the 1712 version of the text). It is bound with Malebranche&#x27;s &quot;Defence against the Accusation of M. de la Ville&quot;, which has not been available in English at all since the seventeenth century. The &quot;Treatise of Nature and Grace&quot; is also included in the same volume. Rival translations of all three of these works were also published by Richard Sault in 1694–95. In addition, the &quot;Conversations chrétiennes&quot; were translated in 1695 as &quot;Christian Conferences... to which is added, Meditations on Humility and Repentance&quot;: this work has also been unavailable in English since the seventeenth century.

The standard edition of Malebranche&#x27;s works in French is the &quot;Œuvres Complètes&quot;, ed. André Robinet, twenty volumes (Paris: J. Vrin, 1958–78).

<doc id="174022" wikidata="Q795465" url="?curid=174022" title="Best alternative to a negotiated agreement">
<text>In negotiation theory, the best alternative to a negotiated agreement (BATNA) is the most advantageous alternative course of action a party can take if negotiations fail and an agreement cannot be reached. The BATNA could include diverse situations, such as suspension of negotiations, transition to another negotiating partner, appeal to the court&#x27;s ruling, the execution of strikes, and the formation of other forms of alliances. BATNA is the key focus and the driving force behind a successful negotiator. A party should generally not accept a worse resolution than its BATNA. Care should be taken, however, to ensure that deals are accurately valued, taking into account all considerations, such as relationship value, time value of money and the likelihood that the other party will live up to their side of the bargain. These other considerations are often difficult to value since they are frequently based on uncertain or qualitative considerations rather than easily measurable and quantifiable factors.

Oftentimes, it is even more difficult to determine the BATNA of the other party. However, this information is crucial as the BATNA determines the other side&#x27;s negotiation power. Sometimes, conclusions can be drawn by determining his/her main interests and the negotiation itself can be used to verify or falsify the assumptions. If, for example, it is assumed that a very early delivery date is of key importance to the negotiating partner, deliberately setting a later delivery date can be proposed. If this late delivery date is decidedly rejected, the desired delivery date is likely to be of great importance.

== History ==
BATNA was developed by negotiation researchers Roger Fisher and William Ury of the Harvard Program on Negotiation (PON), in their series of books on principled negotiation that started with &quot;Getting to YES&quot; (1981), equivalent to the game theory concept of a disagreement point from bargaining problems pioneered by Nobel Laureate John Forbes Nash decades earlier. A Nash Equilibrium is reached among a group of players when no player can benefit from changing strategies if every other player sticks to their current strategy. For example, Amy and Phil are in Nash Equilibrium if Amy is making the best decision she can while taking into account Phil&#x27;s decision, and if Phil is making the best decision he can while taking into account Amy&#x27;s decision. Likewise, a group of players are in Nash Equilibrium if each one is making the best decision that he or she can while taking into account the decisions of others.

==Overview==
The BATNA is often seen by negotiators not as a safety net, but rather as a point of leverage in negotiations. Although a negotiator&#x27;s alternative options should, in theory, be straightforward to evaluate, the effort to understand which alternative represents a party&#x27;s BATNA is often not invested. Options need to be actual and actionable to be of value, however, without the investment of time, options will frequently be included that fail on one of these criteria. Most managers overestimate their BATNA whilst simultaneously investing too little time into researching their real options. This can result in poor or faulty decision making and negotiation outcomes. Negotiators also need to be aware of the other negotiator&#x27;s BATNA and to identify how it compares to what they are offering.

Some people may adopt aggressive, coercive, threatening and/or deceptive techniques. This is known as a hard negotiation style; a theoretical example of this is &quot;adversarial approach style negotiation&quot;. Others may employ a soft style, which is friendly, trusting, compromising, and conflict avoiding. According to Fisher and Ury, when hard negotiators meet soft negotiators, the hard negotiators usually win their position, but at the cost of potentially damaging the long-term relationship between the parties.

Attractive alternatives are needed to develop a strong BATNA. In the book &quot;Getting to YES: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In&quot;, the authors give three suggestions for how to accomplish this:

# Creating a list of actions one might take if no agreement is reached
# Converting some of the more promising ideas and transforming them into tangible and partial alternatives
# Selecting the alternative that sounds best

In negotiations involving different cultures, all parties need to account for cultural cognitive behaviours and should not let judgments and biases affect the negotiation. The individual should be separate from the objective.

The purpose here, as Philip Gulliver mentions, is for negotiation parties to be aware.

Preparation at all levels, including prejudice-free thoughts, emotion-free behaviour, bias-free behaviour are helpful according to Morris and Gelfand.

== BATNA-based tactics and order of negotiations ==
Because of the importance of the BATNA for negotiation success, several tactics focus on weakening the opponent&#x27;s BATNA. This may be achieved e.g. by striving for exclusive negotiations, delaying or accelerating the ongoing negotiations, or limiting the negotiation partner to technical systems. If a negotiator is faced with such tactics it is his/her task to examine the possible consequences for their own BATNA and to prevent or counteract any deterioration of the own party&#x27;s BATNA.

The BATNA can also influence the order in which negotiations are taken up with potential contracting partners. A sequential approach is favourable. In a sequential approach, one starts negotiations with the less favoured partners and continues negotiations with the preferred option afterward. This way, there is the BATNA of a contract with the less favoured partner.

== Difference between BATNA and reservation value ==
A BATNA represents one party&#x27;s best option if negotiations fail, whereas a reservation value represents the worst deal they are willing to accept. When purchasing a bike, for example, the BATNA may represent the option of shopping at another dealer. Depending on the cost of finding other dealers, the reservation value would represent the highest price you are willing to pay.

== Process to develop the best alternative to a negotiated agreement ==
# First, all possible alternatives to the current negotiation are listed out, i.e. the options if the negotiations fail
# The worth of each alternative is determined
# The party selects the option that provides the most value to it. This is its best alternative to a negotiated agreement
# Calculations are preformed for the lowest-valued deal acceptable after determining the BATNA

== Types of BATNA ==
There are three types of BATNA:
# Walk-away BATNA
# Interactive BATNA
# Third-party BATNA
=== Walk-away BATNA ===
If the seller does not want to drop the asking price to less than an alternative option, the buyer will walk away and buy the other alternative. Professional negotiators and researchers alike regard BATNA, or “walk away” outcome as the primary source of relative power for a negotiator. However, relying on alternatives can be risky. A party&#x27;s relative power in a negotiation is their ability to use resources to influence the circumstances of another, and the role of a BATNA in this regard can range from significant to non-existent.

=== Interactive BATNA ===
Interactive BATNAs are sought when one or more parties in a negotiation are not cooperating with the other parties. There are many types of interactive BATNAs, but the three primary ones are:

# Economic: For example, a newspaper forgetting to replace an inappropriate ad in one issue resulting in 50% of their subscribers unsubscribing and them losing half of their ad revenue. In this case, the unsubscribers would be the non-cooperative party.
# Political: For example, a political party filibustering a piece of legislation another party is trying to pass. In this case, the party filibustering would be the non-cooperative one.
# Social: For example, a group of protestors not succumbing to the police&#x27;s attempts at displacement. In this case, the protestors would be the non-cooperative party.

=== Third-party BATNA ===
Third-party BATNAs are sought when two parties in a negotiation are unable to come to a common conclusion on their own or the dispute between them is endless. So, a third party is required in the form of either:
# Mediation: A neutral third party is brought in to help the disputing parties resolve the dispute on their own. Mediation does not resolve the dispute, they just facilitate it.
# Arbitration: A neutral third party is brought in to arbitrate or resolve the negotiation through a BATNA. Unlike mediation, they resolve the issue.
# Litigation: When the negotiation takes a turn for the worst, an authoritative third party intervenes in the form of law and the issue is resolved in court with both parties having to comply with the court&#x27;s decision.

==In popular use==
With tongue-in-cheek, American speculative fiction writer Neal Stephenson places the invention of BATNA in 17th century by putting the following words in his novel The Confusion: &quot;“I learnt it from English traders in Surat,” said the befuddled Surendranath, “It stands for Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement.”&quot; Another character of the novel responds: “To have a BATNA is good and wise, as Surendranath has pointed out. But the Negotiated Agreement is much better than this Best Alternative.”

<text>Spherical geometry or spherics () is the geometry of the two-dimensional surface of a sphere or the -dimensional surface of higher dimensional spheres.

Long studied for its practical applications to astronomy, navigation, and geodesy, spherical geometry and the metrical tools of spherical trigonometry are in many respects analogous to Euclidean plane geometry and trigonometry, but also have some important differences.

The sphere can be studied either &quot;extrinsically&quot; as a surface embedded in 3-dimensional Euclidean space (part of the study of solid geometry), or &quot;intrinsically&quot; using methods that only involve the surface itself without reference to any surrounding space.

==Principles==
In plane (Euclidean) geometry, the basic concepts are points and (straight) lines. In spherical geometry, the basic concepts are point and great circle. However, two great circles on a plane intersect in two antipodal points, unlike coplanar lines in Elliptic geometry.

In the extrinsic 3-dimensional picture, a great circle is the intersection of the sphere with any plane through the center. In the intrinsic approach, a great circle is a geodesic; a shortest path between any two of its points provided they are close enough. Or, in the (also intrinsic) axiomatic approach analogous to Euclid&#x27;s axioms of plane geometry, &quot;great circle&quot; is simply an undefined term, together with postulates stipulating the basic relationships between great circles and the also-undefined &quot;points&quot;. This is the same as Euclid&#x27;s method of treating point and line as undefined primitive notions and axiomatizing their relationships. 

Great circles in many ways play the same logical role in spherical geometry as lines in Euclidean geometry, e.g., as the sides of (spherical) triangles. This is more than an analogy; spherical and plane geometry and others can all be unified under the umbrella of geometry built from distance measurement, where &quot;lines&quot; are defined to mean shortest paths (geodesics). Many statements about the geometry of points and such &quot;lines&quot; are equally true in all those geometries provided lines are defined that way, and the theory can be readily extended to higher dimensions. Nevertheless, because its applications and pedagogy are tied to solid geometry, and because the generalization loses some important properties of lines in the plane, spherical geometry ordinarily does not use the term &quot;line&quot; at all to refer to anything on the sphere itself. If developed as a part of solid geometry, use is made of points, straight lines and planes (in the Euclidean sense) in the surrounding space.

In spherical geometry, angles are defined between great circles, resulting in a spherical trigonometry that differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects; for example, the sum of the interior angles of a spherical triangle exceeds 180 degrees.

==Relation to similar geometries==
Because a sphere and a plane differ geometrically, (intrinsic) spherical geometry has some features of a non-Euclidean geometry and is sometimes described as being one. However, spherical geometry was not considered a full-fledged non-Euclidean geometry sufficient to resolve the ancient problem of whether the parallel postulate is a logical consequence of the rest of Euclid&#x27;s axioms of plane geometry, because it requires another axiom to be modified. The resolution was found instead in elliptic geometry, to which spherical geometry is closely related, and hyperbolic geometry; each of these new geometries makes a different change to the parallel postulate.

The principles of any of these geometries can be extended to any number of dimensions.

An important geometry related to that of the sphere is that of the real projective plane; it is obtained by identifying antipodal points (pairs of opposite points) on the sphere. Locally, the projective plane has all the properties of spherical geometry, but it has different global properties. In particular, it is non-orientable, or one-sided, and unlike the sphere it cannot be drawn as a surface in 3-dimensional space without intersecting itself.

Concepts of spherical geometry may also be applied to the oblong sphere, though minor modifications must be implemented on certain formulas.

==History==

=== Greek antiquity===

The earliest mathematical work of antiquity to come down to our time is &quot;On the rotating sphere&quot; (Περὶ κινουμένης σφαίρας, &quot;Peri kinoumenes sphairas&quot;) by Autolycus of Pitane, who lived at the end of the fourth century BC.

Spherical trigonometry was studied by early Greek mathematicians such as Theodosius of Bithynia, a Greek astronomer and mathematician who wrote &quot;Spherics&quot;, a book on the geometry of the sphere, and Menelaus of Alexandria, who wrote a book on spherical trigonometry called &quot;Sphaerica&quot; and developed Menelaus&#x27; theorem.

===Islamic world===

&quot;The Book of Unknown Arcs of a Sphere&quot; written by the Islamic mathematician Al-Jayyani is considered to be the first treatise on spherical trigonometry. The book contains formulae for right-handed triangles, the general law of sines, and the solution of a spherical triangle by means of the polar triangle.

The book &quot;On Triangles&quot; by Regiomontanus, written around 1463, is the first pure trigonometrical work in Europe. However, Gerolamo Cardano noted a century later that much of its material on spherical trigonometry was taken from the twelfth-century work of the Andalusi scholar Jabir ibn Aflah.

===Euler&#x27;s work===
Leonhard Euler published a series of important memoirs on spherical geometry:

==Properties==
Spherical geometry has the following properties:
* Any two great circles intersect in two diametrically opposite points, called &quot;antipodal points&quot;.
* Any two points that are not antipodal points determine a unique great circle.
* There is a natural unit of angle measurement (based on a revolution), a natural unit of length (based on the circumference of a great circle) and a natural unit of area (based on the area of the sphere).
* Each great circle is associated with a pair of antipodal points, called its &quot;poles&quot; which are the common intersections of the set of great circles perpendicular to it. This shows that a great circle is, with respect to distance measurement &quot;on the surface of the sphere&quot;, a circle: the locus of points all at a specific distance from a center. 
* Each point is associated with a unique great circle, called the &quot;polar circle&quot; of the point, which is the great circle on the plane through the centre of the sphere and perpendicular to the diameter of the sphere through the given point.

As there are two arcs determined by a pair of points, which are not antipodal, on the great circle they determine, three non-collinear points do not determine a unique triangle. However, if we only consider triangles whose sides are minor arcs of great circles, we have the following properties:
* The angle sum of a triangle is greater than 180° and less than 540°.
* The area of a triangle is proportional to the excess of its angle sum over 180°.
* Two triangles with the same angle sum are equal in area.
* There is an upper bound for the area of triangles.
* The composition (product) of two reflections-across-a-great-circle may be considered as a rotation about either of the points of intersection of their axes.
* Two triangles are congruent if and only if they correspond under a finite product of such reflections. 
* Two triangles with corresponding angles equal are congruent (i.e., all similar triangles are congruent).

==Relation to Euclid&#x27;s postulates==

If &quot;line&quot; is taken to mean great circle, spherical geometry only obeys two of Euclid&#x27;s five postulates: the second postulate (&quot;to produce [extend] a finite straight line continuously in a straight line&quot;) and the fourth postulate (&quot;that all right angles are equal to one another&quot;). However, it violates the other three. Contrary to the first postulate (&quot;that between any two points, there is a unique line segment joining them&quot;), there is not a unique shortest route between any two points (antipodal points such as the north and south poles on a spherical globe are counterexamples); contrary to the third postulate, a sphere does not contain circles of arbitrarily great radius; and contrary to the fifth (parallel) postulate, there is no point through which a line can be drawn that never intersects a given line.

A statement that is equivalent to the parallel postulate is that there exists a triangle whose angles add up to 180°. Since spherical geometry violates the parallel postulate, there exists no such triangle on the surface of a sphere. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a sphere is , where &quot;f&quot; is the fraction of the sphere&#x27;s surface that is enclosed by the triangle. For any positive value of &quot;f&quot;, this exceeds 180°.

<doc id="174030" wikidata="Q48743" url="?curid=174030" title="Western blot">
<text>The western blot (sometimes called the protein immunoblot), or western blotting, is a widely used analytical technique in molecular biology and immunogenetics to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract. Besides detecting the proteins, this technique is also utilized to visualize, distinguish, and quantify the different proteins in a complicated protein combination.

Western blot technique uses three elements to achieve its task of separating a specific protein from a complex: separation by size, transfer of protein to a solid support, and marking target protein using a primary and secondary antibody to visualize. A synthetic or animal-derived antibody (known as the primary antibody) is created that recognizes and binds to a specific target protein. The electrophoresis membrane is washed in a solution containing the primary antibody, before excess antibody is washed off. A secondary antibody is added which recognizes and binds to the primary antibody. The secondary antibody is visualized through various methods such as staining, immunofluorescence, and radioactivity, allowing indirect detection of the specific target protein.

Other related techniques include dot blot analysis, quantitative dot blot, immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry, where antibodies are used to detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

The name &quot;western blot&quot; is a play on the Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection named after its inventor, English biologist Edwin Southern. Similarly, detection of RNA is termed as &quot;northern blot&quot;. The term &quot;western blot&quot; was given by W. Neal Burnette in 1981, although the method itself was independently invented in 1979 by Jaime Renart, Jakob Reiser, and George Stark at Stanford University, and by Harry Towbin, Theophil Staehelin, and Julian Gordon at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, Switzerland. The Towbin group also used secondary antibodies for detection, thus resembling the actual method that is almost universally used today. Between 1979 and 2019 &quot;it has been mentioned in the titles, abstracts, and keywords of more than 400,000 PubMed-listed publications&quot; and may still be the most-used protein-analytical technique.

== Applications ==

The western blot is extensively used in biochemistry for the qualitative detection of single proteins and protein-modifications (such as post-translational modifications). At least 8–9% of all protein-related publications are estimated to apply western blots. It is used as a general method to identify the presence of a specific single protein within a complex mixture of proteins. A semi-quantitative estimation of a protein can be derived from the size and colour intensity of a protein band on the blot membrane. In addition, applying a dilution series of a purified protein of known concentrations can be used to allow a more precise estimate of protein concentration. The western blot is routinely used for verification of protein production after cloning. It is also used in medical diagnostics, e.g., in the HIV test or BSE-Test.

The confirmatory HIV test employs a western blot to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human serum sample. Proteins from known HIV-infected cells are separated and blotted on a membrane as above. Then, the serum to be tested is applied in the primary antibody incubation step; free antibody is washed away, and a secondary anti-human antibody linked to an enzyme signal is added. The stained bands then indicate the proteins to which the patient&#x27;s serum contains antibody. A western blot is also used as the definitive test for variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a type of prion disease linked to the consumption of contaminated beef from cattle with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, commonly referred to as &#x27;mad cow disease&#x27;). Another application is in the diagnosis of tularemia. An evaluation of the western blot&#x27;s ability to detect antibodies against &quot;F. tularensis&quot; revealed that its sensitivity is almost 100% and the specificity is 99.6%. Some forms of Lyme disease testing employ western blotting. A western blot can also be used as a confirmatory test for Hepatitis B infection and HSV-2 (Herpes Type 2) infection. In veterinary medicine, a western blot is sometimes used to confirm FIV+ status in cats.

Further applications of the western blot technique include its use by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Blood doping is the misuse of certain techniques and/or substances to increase one&#x27;s red blood cell mass, which allows the body to transport more oxygen to muscles and therefore increase stamina and performance. There are three widely known substances or methods used for blood doping, namely, erythropoietin (EPO), synthetic oxygen carriers and blood transfusions. Each is prohibited under WADA&#x27;s List of Prohibited Substances and Methods. The western blot technique was used during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in the anti-doping campaign for that event. In total, over 1000 samples were collected and analysed by Reichel, et al. in the WADA accredited Laboratory of Lausanne, Switzerland. Recent research utilizing the western blot technique showed an improved detection of EPO in blood and urine based on novel Velum SAR precast horizontal gels optimized for routine analysis. With the adoption of the horizontal SAR-PAGE in combination with the precast film-supported Velum SAR gels the discriminatory capacity of micro-dose application of rEPO was significantly enhanced.

=== Identification of protein localization across cells ===
For medication development, the identification of therapeutic targets, and biological research, it is essential to comprehend where proteins are located within a cell. The subcellular locations of proteins inside the cell and their functions are closely related. The relationship between protein function and localization suggests that when proteins move, their functions may change or acquire new characteristics. A protein&#x27;s subcellular placement can be determined using a variety of methods. Numerous efficient and reliable computational tools and strategies have been created and used to identify protein subcellular localization. With the aid of subcellular fractionation methods, WB continues to be an important fundamental method for the investigation and comprehension of protein localization.

=== Epitope mapping ===
Due to their various epitopes, antibodies have gained interest in both basic and clinical research. The foundation of antibody characterization and validation is epitope mapping. The procedure of identifying an antibody&#x27;s binding sites (epitopes) on the target protein is referred to as &quot;epitope mapping.&quot; Finding the binding epitope of an antibody is essential for the discovery and creation of novel vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. As a result, various methods for mapping antibody epitopes have been created. At this point, western blotting&#x27;s specificity is the main feature that sets it apart from other epitope mapping techniques. There are several application of western blot for epitope mapping on human skin samples, hemorrhagic disease virus.

== Procedure ==

The western blot method is composed of gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide, followed by an electrophoretic transfer onto a membrane (mostly PVDF or nitrocellulose) and an immunostaining procedure to visualize a certain protein on the blot membrane.

Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) is generally used for the denaturing electrophoretic separation of proteins. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is generally used as a buffer (as well as in the gel) in order to give all proteins present a uniform negative charge, since proteins can be positively, negatively, or neutrally charged. Prior to electrophoresis, protein samples are often boiled to denature the proteins present. This ensures that proteins are separated based on size and prevents proteases (enzymes that break down proteins) from degrading samples. Following electrophoretic separation, the proteins are transferred to a membrane (typically nitrocellulose or PVDF). The membrane is often then stained with Ponceau S in order to visualize the proteins on the blot and ensure a proper transfer occurred. Next the proteins are blocked with milk (or other blocking agents) to prevent non-specific antibody binding, and then stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. Lastly, the membrane will be stained with a secondary antibody that recognizes the first antibody staining, which can then be used for detection by a variety of methods. The gel electrophoresis step is included in western blot analysis to resolve the issue of the cross-reactivity of antibodies.

=== Sample preparation ===
As a significant step in conducting a western blot, sample preparation has to be done effectively since the interpretation of this assay is influenced by the protein preparation, which is composed of protein extraction and purification processes. To achieve efficient protein extraction, a proper homogenization method needs to be chosen due to the fact that it is responsible for bursting the cell membrane and releasing the intracellular components. Besides that, the ideal lysis buffer is needed to acquire substantial amounts of target protein content because the buffer is leading the process of protein solubilization and preventing protein degradation. After completing the sample preparation, the protein content is ready to be separated by the utilization of gel electrophoresis.

=== Gel electrophoresis ===
The proteins of the sample are separated using gel electrophoresis. Separation of proteins may be by isoelectric point (pI), molecular weight, electric charge, or a combination of these factors. The nature of the separation depends on the treatment of the sample and the nature of the gel.

By far the most common type of gel electrophoresis employs polyacrylamide gels and buffers loaded with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). SDS-PAGE (SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) maintains polypeptides in a denatured state once they have been treated with strong reducing agents to remove secondary and tertiary structure (e.g. disulfide bonds [S-S] to sulfhydryl groups [SH and SH]) and thus allows separation of proteins by their molecular mass. Sampled proteins become covered in the negatively charged SDS, effectively becoming anionic, and migrate towards the positively charged (higher voltage) anode (usually having a red wire) through the acrylamide mesh of the gel. Smaller proteins migrate faster through this mesh, and the proteins are thus separated according to size (usually measured in kilodaltons, kDa). The concentration of acrylamide determines the resolution of the gel – the greater the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of lower molecular weight proteins. The lower the acrylamide concentration, the better the resolution of higher molecular weight proteins. Proteins travel only in one dimension along the gel for most blots.

Samples are loaded into &quot;wells&quot; in the gel. One lane is usually reserved for a &quot;marker&quot; or &quot;ladder&quot;, which is a commercially available mixture of proteins of known molecular weights, typically stained so as to form visible, coloured bands. When voltage is applied along the gel, proteins migrate through it at different speeds dependent on their size. These different rates of advancement (different &quot;electrophoretic mobilities&quot;) separate into &quot;bands&quot; within each &quot;lane&quot;. Protein bands can then be compared to the ladder bands, allowing estimation of the protein&#x27;s molecular weight.

It is also possible to use a two-dimensional gel which spreads the proteins from a single sample out in two dimensions. Proteins are separated according to isoelectric point (pH at which they have a neutral net charge) in the first dimension, and according to their molecular weight in the second dimension.

=== Transfer ===

To make the proteins accessible to antibody detection, they are moved from within the gel onto a membrane, a solid support, which is an essential part of the process. There are two types of membrane: &quot;nitrocellulose (NC) or polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF&quot;). NC membrane has high affinity for protein and its retention abilities. However, NC is brittle, and does not allow the blot to be used for re-probing, whereas PVDF membrane allows the blot to be re-probed. The most commonly used method for transferring the proteins is called electroblotting. Electroblotting uses an electric current to pull the negatively charged proteins from the gel towards the positively charged anode, and into the PVDF or NC membrane. The proteins move from within the gel onto the membrane while maintaining the organization they had within the gel. An older method of transfer involves placing a membrane on top of the gel, and a stack of filter papers on top of that. The entire stack is placed in a buffer solution which moves up the paper by capillary action, bringing the proteins with it. In practice this method is not commonly used due to the lengthy procedure time.

As a result of either transfer process, the proteins are exposed on a thin membrane layer for detection. Both varieties of membrane are chosen for their non-specific protein binding properties (i.e. binds all proteins equally well). Protein binding is based upon hydrophobic interactions, as well as charged interactions between the membrane and protein. Nitrocellulose membranes are cheaper than PVDF, but are far more fragile and cannot withstand repeated probings.

=== Total protein staining ===

Total protein staining allows the total protein that has been successfully transferred to the membrane to be visualised, allowing the user to check the uniformity of protein transfer and to perform subsequent normalization of the target protein with the actual protein amount per lane. Normalization with the so-called &quot;loading control&quot; was based on immunostaining of housekeeping proteins in the classical procedure, but is heading toward total protein staining recently, due to multiple benefits. At least seven different approaches for total protein staining have been described for western blot normalization: Ponceau S, stain-free techniques, Sypro Ruby, Epicocconone, Coomassie R-350, Amido Black, and Cy5. In order to avoid noise of signal, total protein staining should be performed before blocking of the membrane. Nevertheless, post-antibody stainings have been described as well.

=== Blocking ===
Since the membrane has been chosen for its ability to bind protein and as both antibodies and the target are proteins, steps must be taken to prevent the interactions between the membrane and the antibody used for detection of the target protein. Blocking of non-specific binding is achieved by placing the membrane in a dilute solution of protein – typically 3–5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) or non-fat dry milk (both are inexpensive) in tris-buffered saline (TBS) or I-Block, with a minute percentage (0.1%) of detergent such as Tween 20 or Triton X-100. Although non-fat dry milk is preferred due to its availability, an appropriate blocking solution is needed as not all proteins in milk are compatible with all the detection bands. The protein in the dilute solution attaches to the membrane in all places where the target proteins have not attached. Thus, when the antibody is added, it cannot bind to the membrane, and therefore the only available binding site is the specific target protein. This reduces background in the final product of the western blot, leading to clearer results, and eliminates false positives.

=== Incubation ===

During the detection process, the membrane is &quot;probed&quot; for the protein of interest with a modified antibody which is linked to a reporter enzyme; when exposed to an appropriate substrate, this enzyme drives a colorimetric reaction and produces a colour. For a variety of reasons, this traditionally takes place in a two-step process, although there are now one-step detection methods available for certain applications.

==== Primary antibody ====
The primary antibodies are generated when a host species or immune cell culture is exposed to the protein of interest (or a part thereof). Normally, this is part of the immune response, whereas here they are harvested and used as sensitive and specific detection tools that bind the protein directly.

After blocking, a solution of primary antibody (generally between 0.5 and 5 micrograms/mL) diluted in either PBS or TBST wash buffer is incubated with the membrane under gentle agitation for typically an hour at room temperature, or overnight at 4°C. It can also be incubated at different temperatures, with lesser temperatures being associated with more binding, both specific (to the target protein, the &quot;signal&quot;) and non-specific (&quot;noise&quot;). Following incubation, the membrane is washed several times in wash buffer to remove unbound primary antibody, and thereby minimize background. Typically, the wash buffer solution is composed of buffered saline solution with a small percentage of detergent, and sometimes with powdered milk or BSA.

==== Secondary antibody ====
After rinsing the membrane to remove unbound primary antibody, the membrane is exposed to another antibody known as the secondary antibody. Antibodies come from animal sources (or animal sourced hybridoma cultures). The secondary antibody recognises and binds to the species-specific portion of the primary antibody. Therefore, an anti-mouse secondary antibody will bind to almost any mouse-sourced primary antibody, and can be referred to as an &#x27;anti-species&#x27; antibody (e.g. anti-mouse, anti-goat etc.). To allow detection of the target protein, the secondary antibody is commonly linked to biotin or a reporter enzyme such as alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase. This means that several secondary antibodies will bind to one primary antibody and enhance the signal, allowing the detection of proteins of a much lower concentration than would be visible by SDS-PAGE alone.

Horseradish peroxidase is commonly linked to secondary antibodies to allow the detection of the target protein by chemiluminescence. The chemiluminescent substrate is cleaved by horseradish peroxidase, resulting in the production of luminescence. Therefore, the production of luminescence is proportional to the amount of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, and therefore, indirectly measures the presence of the target protein. A sensitive sheet of photographic film is placed against the membrane, and exposure to the light from the reaction creates an image of the antibodies bound to the blot. A cheaper but less sensitive approach utilizes a 4-chloronaphthol stain with 1% hydrogen peroxide; the reaction of peroxide radicals with 4-chloronaphthol produces a dark purple stain that can be photographed without using specialized photographic film.

As with the ELISPOT and ELISA procedures, the enzyme can be provided with a substrate molecule that will be converted by the enzyme to a coloured reaction product that will be visible on the membrane (see the figure below with blue bands).

Another method of secondary antibody detection utilizes a near-infrared fluorophore-linked antibody. The light produced from the excitation of a fluorescent dye is static, making fluorescent detection a more precise and accurate measure of the difference in the signal produced by labeled antibodies bound to proteins on a western blot. Proteins can be accurately quantified because the signal generated by the different amounts of proteins on the membranes is measured in a static state, as compared to chemiluminescence, in which light is measured in a dynamic state.

A third alternative is to use a radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods are safer, quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).

==== One step ====
Historically, the probing process was performed in two steps because of the relative ease of producing primary and secondary antibodies in separate processes. This gives researchers and corporations huge advantages in terms of flexibility, reduction of cost, and adds an amplification step to the detection process. Given the advent of high-throughput protein analysis and lower limits of detection, however, there has been interest in developing one-step probing systems that would allow the process to occur faster and with fewer consumables. This requires a probe antibody which both recognizes the protein of interest and contains a detectable label, probes which are often available for known protein tags. The primary probe is incubated with the membrane in a manner similar to that for the primary antibody in a two-step process, and then is ready for direct detection after a series of wash steps.

=== Detection and visualization ===

After the unbound probes are washed away, the western blot is ready for detection of the probes that are labeled and bound to the protein of interest. In practical terms, not all westerns reveal protein only at one band in a membrane. Size approximations are taken by comparing the stained bands to that of the marker or ladder loaded during electrophoresis. The process is commonly repeated for a structural protein, such as actin or tubulin, that should not change between samples. The amount of target protein is normalized to the structural protein to control between groups. A superior strategy is the normalization to the total protein visualized with trichloroethanol or epicocconone. This practice ensures correction for the amount of total protein on the membrane in case of errors or incomplete transfers. (see western blot normalization)

==== Colorimetric detection ====
The colorimetric detection method depends on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that reacts with the reporter enzyme (such as peroxidase) that is bound to the secondary antibody. This converts the soluble dye into an insoluble form of a different colour that precipitates next to the enzyme and thereby stains the membrane. Development of the blot is then stopped by washing away the soluble dye. Protein levels are evaluated through densitometry (how intense the stain is) or spectrophotometry.

==== Chemiluminescent detection ====
Chemiluminescent detection methods depend on incubation of the western blot with a substrate that will luminesce when exposed to the reporter on the secondary antibody. The light is then detected by CCD cameras which capture a digital image of the western blot or photographic film. The use of film for western blot detection is slowly disappearing because of non linearity of the image (non accurate quantification). The image is analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density. Newer software allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis if appropriate standards are used.

==== Radioactive detection ====

Radioactive labels do not require enzyme substrates, but rather, allow the placement of medical X-ray film directly against the western blot, which develops as it is exposed to the label and creates dark regions which correspond to the protein bands of interest (see image above). The importance of radioactive detections methods is declining due to its hazardous radiation , because it is very expensive, health and safety risks are high, and ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) provides a useful alternative.

==== Fluorescent detection ====

The fluorescently labeled probe is excited by light and the emission of the excitation is then detected by a photosensor such as a CCD camera equipped with appropriate emission filters which captures a digital image of the western blot and allows further data analysis such as molecular weight analysis and a quantitative western blot analysis. Fluorescence is considered to be one of the best methods for quantification but is less sensitive than chemiluminescence.

=== Secondary probing ===
One major difference between nitrocellulose and PVDF membranes relates to the ability of each to support &quot;stripping&quot; antibodies off and reusing the membrane for subsequent antibody probes. While there are well-established protocols available for stripping nitrocellulose membranes, the sturdier PVDF allows for easier stripping, and for more reuse before background noise limits experiments. Another difference is that, unlike nitrocellulose, PVDF must be soaked in 95% ethanol, isopropanol or methanol before use. PVDF membranes also tend to be thicker and more resistant to damage during use.

=== Minimum requirement specification for Western Blot ===
In order to ensure that the results of Western blots are reproducible, it is important to report the various parameters mentioned above, including specimen preparation, the concentration of protein used for loading, the percentage of gel and running condition, various transfer methods, attempting to block conditions, the concentration of antibodies, and identification and quantitative determination methods. Many of the articles that have been published don&#x27;t cover all of these variables. Hence, it is crucial to describe different experimental circumstances or parameters in order to increase the repeatability and precision of WB. To increase WB repeatability, a minimum reporting criteria is thus required.

== 2-D gel electrophoresis ==

Two-dimensional SDS-PAGE uses the principles and techniques outlined above. 2-D SDS-PAGE, as the name suggests, involves the migration of polypeptides in 2 dimensions. For example, in the first dimension, polypeptides are separated according to isoelectric point, while in the second dimension, polypeptides are separated according to their molecular weight. The isoelectric point of a given protein is determined by the relative number of positively (e.g. lysine, arginine) and negatively (e.g. glutamate, aspartate) charged amino acids, with negatively charged amino acids contributing to a low isoelectric point and positively charged amino acids contributing to a high isoelectric point. Samples could also be separated first under nonreducing conditions using SDS-PAGE, and under reducing conditions in the second dimension, which breaks apart disulfide bonds that hold subunits together. SDS-PAGE might also be coupled with urea-PAGE for a 2-dimensional gel.

In principle, this method allows for the separation of all cellular proteins on a single large gel. A major advantage of this method is that it often distinguishes between different isoforms of a particular protein – e.g. a protein that has been phosphorylated (by addition of a negatively charged group). Proteins that have been separated can be cut out of the gel and then analysed by mass spectrometry, which identifies their molecular weight.

== Problems ==

=== Detection problems ===
There may be a weak or absent signal in the band for a number of reasons related to the amount of antibody and antigen used. This problem might be resolved by using the ideal antigen and antibody concentrations and dilutions specified in the supplier&#x27;s data sheet. Increasing the exposition period in the detection system&#x27;s software can address weak bands caused by lower sample and antibody concentrations.

=== Multiple band problems ===
When the protein is broken down by proteases, several bands other than predicted bands of low molecular weight might appear. The development of numerous bands can be prevented by properly preparing protein samples with enough protease inhibitors. Multiple bands might show up in the high molecular weight region because some proteins form dimers, trimers, and multimers; this issue might be solved by heating the sample for longer periods of time. Proteins with post-translational modifications (PTMs) or numerous isoforms cause several bands to appear at various molecular weight areas. PTMs can be removed from a specimen using specific chemicals, which also remove extra bands.

=== High background ===
Strong antibody concentrations, inadequate blocking, inadequate washing, and excessive exposure time during imaging can result in a high background in the blots. A high background in the blots could be avoided by fixing these issues.

=== Irregular and uneven bands ===
It has been claimed that a variety of odd and unequal bands, including black dots, white spots or bands, and curving bands, have occurred. The block dots are removed from the blots by effective blocking. White patches develop as a result of bubbles between the membrane and gel. White bands appear in the blots when main and secondary antibodies are present in significant concentrations. Because of the high voltage used during the gel run and the rapid protein migration, smiley bands appear in the blots. The strange bands in the blot are resolved by resolving these problems.

== Mitigations ==
During the western blotting, there could be several problems related to the different steps of this procedure. Those problems could originate from a protein analysis step such as the detection of low- or post-translationally modified proteins. Additionally, they can be based on the selection of antibodies since the quality of the antibodies plays a significant role in the detection of proteins specifically. On account of the presence of these kinds of problems, a variety of improvements are being produced in the fields of preparation of cell lysate and blotting procedures to build up reliable results. Moreover, to achieve more sensitive analysis and overcome the problems associated with western blotting, several different techniques have been developed and utilized, such as far-western blotting, diffusion blotting, single-cell resolution western blotting, and automated microfluidic western blotting.

== Presentation ==

Researchers use different software to process and align image-sections for elegant presentation of western blot results. Popular tools include Sciugo, Microsoft PowerPoint, Adobe Illustrator and GIMP.

<text>The secretary of state for Northern Ireland (; ), also referred to as Northern Ireland Secretary or SoSNI, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with overall responsibility for the Northern Ireland Office. The officeholder is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The incumbent secretary of state for Northern Ireland is Hilary Benn.

The officeholder works alongside the other Northern Ireland Office ministers. The corresponding shadow minister is the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland.

==History==
Historically, the principal ministers for Irish (and subsequently Northern Ireland) affairs in the UK Government and its predecessors were:
* the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland ( 1171–1922);
* the Chief Secretary for Ireland (1560–1922); and
* the Home Secretary (1922–1972).

In August 1969, for example, Home Secretary James Callaghan approved the sending of British Army soldiers to Northern Ireland. Scotland and Wales were represented by the roles of Secretary of State for Scotland and Secretary of State for Wales from 1885 and 1964 respectively, but Northern Ireland remained separate, owing to the devolved Government of Northern Ireland and Parliament of Northern Ireland.

The office of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was created after the Northern Ireland government (at Stormont) was first suspended and then abolished following widespread civil strife. The British government was increasingly concerned that Stormont was losing control of the situation. On 30 March 1972, direct rule from Westminster was introduced. The secretary of state filled three roles which existed under the previous Stormont regime:
* the governor of Northern Ireland (the nominal head of the executive and representative of the British monarch)
* the prime minister of Northern Ireland (in the present day, a role filled by the first minister of Northern Ireland and deputy first minister of Northern Ireland acting jointly)
* the minister of home affairs (in the present day, a role filled by the minister of justice).

Direct rule was seen as a temporary measure, with a power-sharing devolution preferred as the solution, and was annually renewed by a vote in Parliament.

The Sunningdale Agreement in 1973 resulted in the brief existence of a power-sharing Northern Ireland Executive from 1 January 1974, which was ended by the loyalist Ulster Workers&#x27; Council strike on 28 May 1974. The strikers opposed the power-sharing and all-Ireland aspects of the new administration.

The Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention (1975–1976) and Northern Ireland Assembly (1982–1986) were unsuccessful in restoring devolved government. After the Anglo-Irish Agreement on 15 November 1985, the UK Government and Irish Government co-operated more closely on security and political matters.

Following the Belfast Agreement (also known as the Good Friday Agreement) on 10 April 1998, devolution returned to Northern Ireland on 2 December 1999. This removed many of the duties of the secretary of state and his Northern Ireland Office colleagues and devolved them to those locally elected politicians who constitute the Northern Ireland Executive.

Formerly holding a large portfolio over home affairs in Northern Ireland, the current devolution settlement has lessened the secretary of state&#x27;s role, granting many of the former powers to the Northern Ireland Assembly and Northern Ireland Executive. The secretary of state is now generally limited to representing Northern Ireland in the UK cabinet, overseeing the operation of the devolved administration and a number of reserved and excepted matters which remain the sole competence of the UK Government e.g. security, human rights, certain public inquiries and the administration of elections.

Created in 1972, the position has switched between members of Parliament from the Conservative Party and Labour Party. As Labour has not fielded candidates in Northern Ireland, and the Conservatives have not had candidates elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly or for House of Commons seats in the region, those appointed as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland have not represented a constituency in Northern Ireland. This contrasts with the secretaries of state for Scotland and Wales.

The secretary of state officially resides in Hillsborough Castle, which was previously the official residence of the governor of Northern Ireland, and remains the royal residence of the monarch in Northern Ireland. The secretary of state exercises their duties through, and is administratively supported by, the Northern Ireland Office (NIO).

The devolved administration was suspended several times (especially between 15 October 2002 and 8 May 2007) because the Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party were uncomfortable being in government with Sinn Féin when the Provisional Irish Republican Army had failed to decommission its arms fully and continued its criminal activities. On each of these occasions, the responsibilities of the ministers in the Executive then returned to the secretary of state and his ministers. During these periods, in addition to administration of the region, the secretary of state was also heavily involved in the negotiations with all parties to restore devolved government.

Power was again devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 8 May 2007. The secretary of state retained responsibility for policing and justice until most of those powers were devolved on 12 April 2010. Robert Hazell has suggested merging the offices of Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, for Scotland and for Wales into one secretary of state for the Union, in a department into which Rodney Brazier has suggested adding a minister of state for England with responsibility for English local government.

<doc id="174042" wikidata="Q53660" url="?curid=174042" title="Per Albin Hansson">
<text>Per Albin Hansson (28 October 1885 – 6 October 1946) was a Swedish politician, chairman of the Social Democrats from 1925 and two-time Prime Minister in four governments between 1932 and 1946, governing all that period save for a short-lived crisis in the summer of 1936, which he ended by forming a coalition government with his main adversary, Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp. He has been described as one of the fathers of modern Sweden.

==Political activity==
During World War II, in which Sweden maintained a policy of neutrality, he presided over a government of national unity that included all major parties in the Riksdag with the exception of the Communist Party. Forging the Social Democratic grip on Swedish politics that would last throughout the century, Hansson left an astounding legacy on his party as well as creating the idea of Sweden to become &quot;Folkhemmet&quot;, &quot;The People&#x27;s Home&quot;. This remained intact until the early 1990s, including a strict policy of neutrality, a wide-stretching welfare state through parliamentary legislation, and reformist social corporatism rather than Marxist socialization of the means of production. Following the war, Hansson formed a Social Democratic cabinet enjoying absolute majority in the Riksdag before succumbing to a heart attack on his way home from work late at night on 6 October 1946.

During Hansson&#x27;s fourteen years as Prime Minister of Sweden, a wide range of reforms were realised, such as income-tested child allowances for invalidity pensioners and widows, maternity allowances through voluntary sickness insurance, and a 1935 law that introduced state subsidies for the construction of apartment houses for families with three or more children, combined with housing allowances for families with more than two children living in these houses. Subsidised dental care was also established. By 1953, dental clinics were open to the whole population, with children receiving free treatment and adults either paying a modest fee or (in the case of less well-off persons) free treatment as well. 

A bill that provided for &quot;the establishment of a voluntary unemployment insurance scheme was passed into law and came into force on 1 January 1935.&quot; The Government also allocated funds for the improvement of rural housing. An act of 26 June 1936 amended that of 1929 &quot;so as to include all the diseases contained in the revised Convention, as well as those due to carbon monoxide, cyanogen and its compounds, chlorine, nitrous fumes, chromic acid and its compounds, and certain infectious diseases (hospital staffs, etc.).&quot; A People&#x27;s Travel Association was founded for workers and their families in March 1937. An act of 11 September 1936 &quot;contains a new regulation of the right of association and collective bargaining. The act applies not only to workers in private undertakings but also to employees in the service of the State or the communes who have not the status of officials.&quot; On 1 November 1936 an act came into force &quot;regulating hours of work on farms employing more than four workers, exclusive of cattle tenders. The maximum working day is 10 hours, and the net working week may vary from 46 to 56 hours in the course of the year.&quot; According to one study, the years 1937 to 1939 became &quot;a harvest season for a series of social reforms that previously for the most part were dreams for the future.&quot; 

Writing on these years, Hansson stated that &quot;1937 loosened things up. That is when a pension amendment indexed to the cost of living was enacted, child support, mothers’ assistance, maternity assistance, far-reaching improvements in preventative mother and child care, the housing loan fund. The regulation of farm labor was approved. 1938 gave us compulsory holidays, the national dental plan, and the Institute for Health Insurance. 1939 saw the regulation of working hours … [and] housing for pensioners was created for the aged.&quot; 

An act to provide for 12 days of annual holiday with pay for workers passed the Riksdag on 2 June 1938, while a Royal Notification of 2 December 1938 &quot;deals with medical inspection of workers exposed to silicosis, referring to: examination on engagement and annually thereafter; practical methods to be followed; medical authorities entrusted with examination; recording of results on the health register, etc.&quot; The Workers&#x27; Protection Act of 1912 was &quot;amended and extended to cover certain aspects of hygiene and protection for young persons even in the smaller undertakings, as well as medical examination for adults on engagement and periodically thereafter in the case of particularly unhealthy trades, notably those involving exposure to lead poisoning and to silicosis.&quot; Also, under legislation of (&quot;act of 3 June 1938, notification of 17 June 1938&quot;) &quot;compensation has been extended to cover forms of dermatitis due to the use of chlorinated derivatives of phenol for impregnating wood.&quot; A 1938 act amended the Workers&#x27; Protection Act, with an Institute of Social Hygiene set up; one of its duties being the study of maternity protection. An act of 1938 authorised &quot;loans and grants for the erection of roomy accommodation for large families living in overcrowded buildings in rural districts.&quot; The 48-hour week &quot;has been extended to cover the staff in lunatic asylums and the Government has fixed the increases in staff which this reform involves.&quot; The Holidays with Pay act, which was promulgated on 17 June 1938, &quot;contains special provisions for home workers.&quot; This act &quot;introduced a legal system of annual holidays with pay in the country. The act, which is of general application, grants one working day&#x27;s holiday for every month of service after one year, provided that at least 180 days have been worked in the same undertaking and at least 16 days per month; the act may not be used to invalidate any more favourable conditions contained in collective agreements. For seamen in particular the payment during the holiday includes wages and an allowance for food. Changes in the ownership of the vessel and interruptions of service for which the seaman is not responsible do not affect the right to the holiday.&quot; 

A new act fixed hours of work for employees in commerce. From 1 January 1939 the working hours for nursing and domestic staff were 48 in the week, and on 10 March 1939 &quot;the Government presented a Bill to amend the act of 16 May 1930 on hours of work in bakeries. The proposed amendments would enable Sweden to ratify the international Convention on the subject. They suppressed the exemption of family undertakings from the scope of the act and the provisions under which the act applied only to the production of bread and pastry for sale. The Bill was passed by Parliament on 11 May 1939.&quot; Instructions concerning the inspectorates for electrical installations, explosives and ships were published on 30 June 1939 and other instructions on the inspection of lifts on 13 December 1939. Three Royal Notifications of 26 January 1940 &quot;amended the existing regulations on the special inspection of the State railways, private railways and explosive substances.&quot; The war risks of seamen in the event of accidents were dealt with in an act of 11 June 1937, which provided &quot;for a very considerable increase in the accident benefits normally due to seamen if the injury or death results from an act of war. In the event of total incapacity or death the individual is entitled to a lump sum which, in the case of officers, is generally equal to twelve months&#x27; salary, and in the case of all other ratings, 4,800 kr. For partial incapacity the sum is proportionately reduced.&quot; An act of 14 October 1939 provided that &quot;no person may be discharged from employment on account of military or other service which he is required by law to perform. The parties may however agree to override this rule if the military service is to last more than three months.&quot; An act of 19 May 1939 prohibited employers &quot;from discharging, owing to engagement or marriage, any wage earner with at least two years&#x27; continuous service in the undertaking. Any agreement to the contrary is null and void and an employer who contravenes this rule must pay damages. The act applies to undertakings employing at least three persons.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Per Albin Hansson was born in Kulladal, a neighborhood in Malmö, Sweden, on 28 October 1885.

One of the first professional politicians of Sweden, Hansson participated in the creation of the Swedish Social Democratic Youth in 1903 and presided over it as its chairman in 1908–09, a period in which universal suffrage and proportional representation was to be gradually enacted for all Swedish males by Conservative Prime Minister Arvid Lindman, later a rival of Hansson. Influenced generally by Karl Kautsky&#x27;s views on socialism, Hansson succeeded Hjalmar Branting as editor of &quot;Social-Demokraten&quot; in 1917 and was appointed his Minister of Defence in Sweden&#x27;s first Social Democratic cabinet in 1920, following a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition enacting equal suffrage for men and women (in effect as of the 1921 election). Per Albin Hansson held this office in all of Branting&#x27;s three cabinets between 1920 and 1925 (years which saw eight governments), performing numerous cut-backs on the military budget. Upon Branting&#x27;s death in 1925, Hansson rose to be embraced as chairman of the party. His legitimacy remained under dispute, however, and only in 1927 did he become the head of the Riksdag faction, before having been confirmed undisputedly as Branting&#x27;s successor in a 1928 congress.

Upon losing power to Carl Gustaf Ekman&#x27;s pro-prohibition Liberals in 1926, Hansson worked from the opposition bench and, although heading what was to remain the largest party of the Riksdag to date, faced a major setback upon cooperating with the Communists in the infamous election of 1928. Hansson&#x27;s party did poorly as a result, and not until the 2010 election would the Social Democrats and the Communists (the latter changed its name, in 1995, to the Left Party) would the two parties run in tandem again.

In opposition to the Conservative – though equally pragmatic and staunchly anti-fascist – Lindman cabinet, Hansson pressed for the introduction of a welfare state rather than wide-scale nationalizations. He called his vision &quot;Folkhemmet&quot; (&quot;the People&#x27;s Home&quot;) in a Riksdag debate in 1928.

Following the fall of Ekman in 1932 due to a corruption scandal involving the recently deceased industrialist Ivar Kreuger, the Social Democrats made gains, which altogether gave them 104 Riksdag seats and 41.7% of the popular vote. Though this left them short of a majority, they benefited from the inability of the Liberal parties (themselves unable to form a single faction until 1934), the Conservatives and the Agrarians to form a stable administration of their own. This inability gave Hansson his chance. He courted and eventually obtained support from the Farmers&#x27; League, through promising an agriculture policy favoring the interests of the League (&quot;kohandeln&quot;), although he stopped short of giving League parliamentarians any cabinet posts.

In June 1936, the combined efforts of the Liberals, the Conservatives and the Agrarians brought the Hansson-led government to an end and ensured Hansson&#x27;s own resignation as prime minister. Following Hansson&#x27;s departure, League chairman Axel Pehrsson-Bramstorp was able to form a three-month &quot;Vacation Cabinet&quot;. That lasted until the elections in September, which saw a rise in support of the Social Democrats. This time Hansson invited certain League members into the cabinet, and Pehrsson-Brahmstorp therefore became Minister of Agriculture. The administration enjoyed a substantial parliamentary majority that lasted until 1939.

==World War II==
Following the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Hansson declared strict neutrality and called for the formation of a broad coalition government involving all major parties under his leadership, which was realized in December except only the pro-Stalin Communist Party and its short-lived pro-German splinter faction, the Socialist Party. Alone in Europe save for Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Ireland and the Vatican, Sweden maintained neutrality throughout all World War II, but like the mentioned countries, cooperated and traded with both sides. Winston Churchill claimed that Sweden during World War II ignored the greater moral issues and played both sides for profit, a criticism mimicked in criticism towards Sweden&#x27;s policy towards the German occupation of Denmark and Norway upheld partly by transportation reinforcement through Swedish territory, sanctioned by Hansson&#x27;s cabinet.

The German invasion of the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941, Operation Barbarossa sparked an ultimatum known as the Midsommarkrisen by the government of Nazi Germany to Hansson&#x27;s cabinet, demanding some military concessions, including German troop transports on Swedish railways in order to support Germany&#x27;s ally Finland. Political deliberations surrounding this ultimatum have been dubbed the &quot;midsummer crisis&quot;, which ultimately, allegedly following King Gustav V&#x27;s decision to resign should the concessions not be made, fell out in favor of the Axis. The 83-year-old king formally (although having not directly intervened in the government&#x27;s policies since 1914) had the powers to appoint his own cabinet, and his open intervention in the issue was seen as a threat to the stability of the government and, given the ongoing war, to the sovereignty of the nation.

Recent research by Carl-Gustaf Scott argues however that there never was a &quot;crisis&quot; and that &quot;the crisis was created in historical hindsight in order to protect the political legacy of the Social Democratic Party and its leader Per Albin Hansson.&quot;

To get the steel required by the German Ruhr and Upper Silesia industry, Germany was, in 1939–1940, dependent on shipments of Swedish iron ore, since access to the supplies from the mines in France, the traditional supplier, were cut off until the invasion of France. In 1939–1940 the Allies tried various ways to stop the shipments of Swedish ore, for example by mining Norwegian territorial waters.

In effect, the main political priority was to avoid direct war engagement of Sweden during World War II. Following Germany&#x27;s setbacks around 1942–43, Sweden was no longer seriously threatened by an invasion from Nazi Germany and subsequently rolled back most of its concessions.

==Death and political legacy==
Following the surrender of Germany, Hansson wanted to maintain a Social Democratic-led coalition government of all non-Communist parties. However, he failed to achieve this as a result of strong opposition within his own party which favoured a radical reformist agenda following the war. Hansson reluctantly agreed to a single-party government. He had abandoned his early revolutionary and strictly anti-militarist views in favor of social corporatism, class collaboration and a reformist agenda involving few nationalizations but stable armed forces in order to secure neutrality.

In January 1946, Hansson&#x27;s government controversially agreed to extradite soldiers from the Baltic states that had been conscripted into the German armed forces and sought refuge in Sweden to the USSR, despite widespread protests and opposition from the Swedish public and the King. The government of Sweden formally apologized for this in 2011.

He died from a heart attack in Stockholm on 6 October 1946 while stepping off a tram at the Ålstens Gård station. He was succeeded as party chairman and prime minister by Minister of Education Tage Erlander, who held both offices concurrently until 1969, completing most of Hansson&#x27;s legacy. Per Albin Hansson, seen often as the most successful prime minister in Swedish history. He is interred in Norra Begravningsplatsen in Stockholm.

==Private life==
Per Albin Hansson was married to Elisabeth Fryckberg between 1918–1926. Before marrying her, he lived with Sigrid Vestdahl and fathered one child by her in 1908. He continued his relationship with Vestdahl after his marriage to Fryckberg. He lived with and supported both families financially. This was most likely known to the press, but little was written about it. It appears both women were aware of the situation.

==In popular culture==
In the Swedish television movie &quot;Four Days that shook Sweden – The Midsummer Crisis 1941&quot; from 1988, he is played by Swedish character actor Ernst-Hugo Järegård. 

According to Daunfeldt, in Social democratic historiagraphy, Hansson is portrayed as the father of modern Sweden.

<doc id="174046" wikidata="Q242023" url="?curid=174046" title="Carmen Amaya">
<text>Carmen Amaya (2 November 1918 – 19 November 1963) occasionally known by the stage name La Capitana, was a Spanish Romani flamenco dancer and singer, born in the Somorrostro district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

She is often hailed as &quot;the greatest Flamenco dancer ever&quot; and &quot;the most extraordinary personality of all time in flamenco dance.&quot; She was the first female flamenco dancer to master footwork previously reserved for the best male dancers, due to its speed and intensity. She sometimes danced in high-waisted trousers as a symbol of her strong character.

==Biography==
Carmen Amaya Amaya was born in Somorrostro, Spain, to a Romani family, her father José Amaya Amaya (&quot;alias&quot; &quot;El Chino&quot;, &quot;The Chinaman&quot;), a guitar player, and Micaela Amaya Moreno, her mother. Carmen was the second of eleven children, although only six (three sisters and two brothers) survived to adulthood. She was also the cousin of famed flamenco dancers La Chunga, and La Chunguita.

Her date of birth is disputed. Montse Madridejos and David Pérez Merinero name 1918 as her year of birth. They cite Barcelona&#x27;s inhabitants list of 1930, in which a family &quot;Amalla&quot; with a 12-year-old daughter Carmen is mentioned. They claim that no birth document is available and the document of baptism was lost due to a church fire. Furthermore, a 1920 oil painting by Julio Moisés named &quot;Maternidad&quot; shows a mother with a 2-3 year old girl, supposed to be Carmen with her mother Micaela. According to them, photographs showing Carmen Amaya as a teenager also support 1918 as the year of birth. According to Montse Madridejos, professor of Music History at the University of Barcelona and a flamenco history researcher, who specializes in Carmen Amaya, her ethnicity could have also been a factor in the birth date ambiguity: &quot;At that time, a gypsy was neither baptized, nor registered&quot;.

In 2023, the researcher Montse Madridejos published an academic article in the journal Sinfonía Virtual in which she underscores and gives more weight to 1918 as the possible year of birth of Carmen Amaya.

Amaya entered the flamenco world accompanied by her father, an impoverished Calé Romani guitarist who made a living by playing in pubs day and night. When Carmen was a child, she started going out with her father at night. He accompanied her on the guitar while she performed. Afterwards, they begged and picked the small change that the public threw on the floor. Soon earned her first nickname, &quot;La Capitana&quot;.

At the same time, she started to appear in some lesser known theaters. It was only after Josep Santpere, a bright variety show businessman, showed for the first time his interest in Carmen and introduced her to more prestigious venues, that she made her debut at the Spanish Theatre in Barcelona. Soon after, she was performing at the Palace Theatre in Paris.

The first time she appeared in print was in 1931 thanks to Sebastià Gasch, an art critic who saw her and wrote an article in the weekly newspaper . Sebastian Gash wrote:&quot;Suddenly a jump! And the gypsy girl danced. Indescribable. Soul. Pure Soul. Feeling made flesh. The floorboards vibrated with unprecedented brutality and incredible precision. La Capitana was a gross product of Nature. Like all gypsies, She must have been born dancing. It was before school, before the academy. All that she knows, She must have known from birth. Promptly, the viewer feels subjugated, upset, dominated by the face of La Capitana, by her fierce hip movements, by the bravery of her pirouettes and the force of her broken turns, whose animal ardor ran parallel with the astonishing accuracy with which she executed them. The raging battery of her heels and the unsteady play of her arms now aroused, excited, then collapsing, surrendered, abandoned, dead, gently moved by the shoulders, are still recorded in our memories like indelible plaques. what caused us to look at her dance was her nerve, which twisted her in dramatic contortions, her blood, her violence, her wild impetuosity as a caste dancer.&quot;

At this point Vicente Escudero, a respected businessman, saw her dancing and concluded that Carmen would bring about a flamenco revolution thanks to her perfect synthesis of two important styles: that of the traditional dancers, and the looming style of dancers in the varieties.

In 1930, she was part of the Manuel Vallejo company, performing all over Spain. On her return to Barcelona she danced at the Teatro Español, recommended by José Cepero.

That year she worked in the Zarzuela Theatre, also known as the Coliseum, in Madrid with Conchita Piquer, Miguel de Molina, and other famous artists, and at the Fontalba Theatre. That was the authentic success of Carmen nationwide. She played a small role in &quot;La hija de Juan Simón&quot; and &quot;Maria de la O&quot;, and worked for a musical magazine in Barcelona. From her first performance&quot; in 1935 to her last one in &quot;Los Tarantos&quot;, her dancing showcases the purest form of flamenco. The films she starred in are remarkable in that very few films have been created around one figure. They are also a model for all dancers who define their dance as being &quot;of temperament&quot;. Very seldom in the history of New York have dance and flamenco been as successful as Carmen Amaya&#x27;s performances.

Juan Carceller hired her for a tour. She travelled to several big cities, including San Sebastián. In 1935, Luisita Esteo presented her in Madrid, in a show at the Coliseum. On 18 July 1936, when the coup in Spain took place, Carmen and her team were in the Zorrilla Theatre in Valladolid, working for Carcellé&#x27;s company. At that time, they were financially secure and she had bought her first car. They were due to go to Lisbon to sign the lease, but the car was requisitioned and they could not travel to Portugal until November.

===Beginning of international success: Latin America (1936–1940)===
In 1936, when the Spanish Civil War had just begun, Carmen Amaya and her troupe were on tour in Valladolid with Luisita Esteso&#x27;s show. They crossed the border from Spain to Portugal and, after a short time arrived in Lisbon. From there they sailed for Buenos Aires on the ship Monte Pascoal, which took fifteen days to cross the Atlantic and arrive at Brazil and Uruguay. She debuted in Buenos Aires, accompanied by Ramón Montoya and Sabicas at the Maravillas Theatre.

During this stage of her life, she added to her artistic group several members of her family. She made films in Buenos Aires with Miguel de Molina and won the admiration of musicians Arturo Toscanini and Leopold Stokowski, who publicly praised her.

The success of Carmen Amaya and her family exceeded all expectations. They planned to stay for only four weeks but ended up staying there for nine months, since every time Carmen performed, the theater was filled and tickets were sold out two months in advance. A good example of the enormous popularity that the artist achieved in this South American country is the construction of a theater that bears her name: el Teatro Amaya.

In addition, it seems that during most of those years in America the bailaora maintained a personal relationship with Sabicas, who declared shortly before his death that he and Carmen had been dating for nine years, and that they had split in Mexico.

===Consolidation in the United States (1941–1947)===
In the US, Carmen Amaya met many of the most influential people of her time. She went several times to Hollywood to film some movies and the most important personalities of cinema, music or culture wanted to see her dance. The musician Toscanini saw one of her performances once and declared that he had never seen an artist with more rhythm and more fire. She improvised continuously, as quickly as perfectly.

She traveled to New York in 1941 and performed at Carnegie Hall with Sabicas and Antonio de Triana. Whilst in the United States, she also met Franklin Roosevelt, President of the United States. It was reported that after seeing her, Roosevelt gave her a bowling jacket with brilliants and invited her to dance at the White House. She returned to Europe where she performed at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris and later in London, where she got to meet the Queen of the United Kingdom.

===Return to Spain===
When Carmen Amaya returned to Spain in 1947, she was already a world-famous figure. In the years spent in America she not only professionally established herself as an artist, but also became, inevitably, a legend. By then, her dance was the most daring flamenco ever performed in a theater. However, she did not stand out only for her art but also for her fascinating personality, which won over everyone she knew, both because of her dancing and her unpredictable behaviour. She also was extraordinarily generous.

She was a great success at the London Princess Theatre in 1948, and also on her next American tour. She toured Argentina again in 1950.

She returned to dance in Spain the following year, performing at the Tivoli theatro in Barcelona after several performances in Rome. She continued her work in Madrid, Paris, London, and different cities in Germany, Italy, and the rest of Europe. The Queen of England congratulated her when she performed there; Carmen Amaya and Elizabeth II appeared together in a newspaper photograph entitled: &quot;Two queens face to face.&quot;

In 1951, she married guitarist Juan Antonio Agüero, a member of her troupe, coming from a distinguished family from Santander, who was not a gypsy. They lived an authentic love story and celebrated an intimate wedding. In 1959, Carmen experienced one of the most exciting moments of her life, when the inauguration ceremony of a fountain bearing her name was held. The fountain was placed on the Paseo Marítimo de Barcelona, which crosses the neighbourhood of Somorrostro, the same places where she had walked by many years before as a child, barefoot and dragging her misery.

In subsequent years she continued her work in northern Europe, France, Spain, the United States, Mexico and South America.
She triumphed at the Westminster Theatre in London and at La Zarzuela theatre in Madrid in 1959. At that time, Barcelona paid tribute to Carmen Amaya by building the Carmen Fountain in the artist&#x27;s old home district, Somorrostro, to popular acclaim.

She recorded her last film, &quot;Los Tarantos&quot;, by Rovira-Beleta in 1963, and afterwards continued working. At the end her illness, a kind of renal impairment that impeded her properly eliminating the toxins that her body accumulated, prevented her from continuing in Gandía.

Her illness was exacerbated by the filming of her latest film, Los Tarantos, directed by Rovira-Beleta (1963). Carmen overcame her health issues and at the end of filming started a summer tour. The last time she performed in Madrid, she was already terminally ill. Finally, her illness stopped her from performing. The doctors could not find a suitable treatment. She danced for the last time in Malaga. On 8 August 1963, whilst she was working in Gandía, Carmen interrupted her performance. She was dancing when suddenly she said to Batista: &quot;Andrés, we finished.&quot;

===Death===
Carmen Amaya died of kidney disease in Begur, Girona, Catalonia, northeast Spain, in 1963 and is buried at the Cemetery of Ciriego in Santander.

She was awarded the Medal of Merit of Tourism in Barcelona, the Lasso of the Lady of the Order of Isabel la Católica award, and given the title of Adoptive Daughter of Begur.

Three years after her death (1966) she was honored by a monument placed in the Amusement Park of Montjuic. Buenos Aires has a street named after her. In Madrid in the &quot;Tablao&quot; Los Califas, she was honored by a tribute performance in which many artists participated, including Lucero Tena, Mariquilla, and Felix de Utrera.

In 1988, as an homage to Carmen Amaya, the Tablao de Carmen was founded in the Poble Espanyol, the very place where she danced for the King of Spain Alfonso XIII during the inauguration of the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition. Tablao de Carmen displays some of the photographic legacy of Carmen Amaya. The guitar of her husband Juan Antonio Agüero (by Santos Hernández 1930) is a part of the patrimony of the founder family of Tablao de Carmen and it is played in the Tablao on special occasions.

=== Medals and recognition awards ===
Her death was a great loss for the entire Flamenco world. She was awarded with the Medalla del Mérito Turístico de Barcelona, Lazo de Isabel la Católica and the title of Hija Adoptiva de Bagur. Her funeral summoned a large number of Roma People from different parts of Spain and even France.

Amaya died in Bagur, where she spent her last days, her remains rest in the crypt of her husband&#x27;s family, in Santander. Three years after her death in 1966, the statues of her were erected in the Parque de Montjuic in Barcelona, and in Buenos Aires, while in Madrid, in Tablao Los Califas, a tribute, led by Lucero Tena, among other artists, took place. She was also honored in Llafranch (Girona) in 1970.

The personality of Carmen Amaya has been celebrated by critics, flamencologists and writers, as well as by poets, including Fernando Quiñones, author of the poem Soneto y letras en vivo para Car men Amaya. A selected transcription of these comments by Vicente Marrero, reads:
&quot;Carmen Amaya can see the amazing conviction that sometimes tends to dance. &quot;Gitanilla&quot; ungainly, skinny, petite, almost disembodied. Brunette, with a tragic and remote idol face, Asian cheekbones, with long eyes full of omens, twisted arms. With her &quot;repajolera&quot; gypsy [Romani] grace, she is not just another millionaire in North America, but one of our great dancers, who has succeeded, with the secret of dance and her dance she was born to dance, and she danced phenomenally. Carmen Amaya, is her name, is not a different woman in each of her dances, as so often happens with other great dance figures.&quot;

&quot;&quot;Carmen Amaya can see the amazing conviction that sometimes tends to dance. &quot;Gitanilla&quot; ungainly, skinny, petite, almost disembodied. Brunette, with a tragic and remote idol face, Asian cheekbones, with long eyes full of omens, twisted arms. With her &quot;repajolera&quot; gypsy [Romani] grace, she is not just another millionaire in North America, but one of our great dancers, who has succeeded, with the secret of dance and her dance she was born to dance, and she danced phenomenally. Carmen Amaya, is her name, is not a different woman in each of her dances, as so often happens with other great dance figures.&quot;&quot;

Carmen&#x27;s flamenco legacy is still valid to this day as an example of dancing with force, meter, intensity and power and a way of expression which brought an end to the sweetness of flamenco which had endured until that point. The famous producer Sol Hurok described Carmen as &quot;The Human Vesuvius.&quot; Carmen Amaya has been the incarnation of the flamenco dance par excellence. She has danced in numerous films.

On 2 November 2023, Google celebrated her 110th birthday with a Google Doodle.

<doc id="174050" wikidata="Q162209" url="?curid=174050" title="Bernice Johnson Reagon">
<text>Bernice Johnson Reagon (October 4, 1942 – July 16, 2024) was an American song leader, composer, professor of American history, curator at the Smithsonian, and social activist. In the early 1960s, she was a founding member of the Freedom Singers, organized by the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the Albany Movement for civil rights in Georgia. In 1973, she founded the all-black female &quot;a cappella&quot; ensemble Sweet Honey in the Rock, based in Washington, D.C. Reagon, along with other members of the SNCC Freedom Singers, realized the power of collective singing to unify the disparate groups who began to work together in the 1964 Freedom Summer protests in the South. 

The Albany Singing Movement became a vital catalyst for change through music in the early 1960s protests of the Civil Rights era. Reagon devoted her life to social justice through music via recordings, activism, community singing, and scholarship.

She earned her Ph.D. from Howard University, becoming a cultural historian, centered on the role of music. She was professor emerita in the Department of History at The American University. She had also been a scholar-in-residence at Stanford and received an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.

==Early life and education==
Bernice Johnson was born in 1942 in Dougherty County, Georgia, United States. She was the daughter of Beatrice and J.J. Johnson, a Baptist minister. She was born and raised in southwest Georgia, where church and school were an integrated part of her life, with music heavily intertwined in both of those settings. Reagon began school at the age of three when she was asked by her teacher to attend early, and she passed that first year. By the time she was in the 4th, 5th, and 6th grade, she was requested to tutor students in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, and she said it was because there had only been one teacher. 

In 1959, she entered Albany State College (since July 1996 called Albany State University), where she began her study of music. She also became active in the local NAACP chapter and then the SNCC. After being expelled from Albany State because of an arrest as an activist, she briefly attended Spelman College.

Later, she returned to Spelman to complete her undergraduate degree in 1970. She received a Ford Foundation fellowship to do graduate study at Howard University, where she was awarded the Ph.D. degree in 1975.

==Career==
===Activism===
Reagon&#x27;s first demonstration had been in protest against the arrest of Bertha Gober, and Blanton Hall, organized by SNCC along with the initial arrest of the two individuals, for they planned to be arrested in a discussion during a SNCC meeting. Reagon was an active participant in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s. She was a member of The Freedom Singers, organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), for which she also served as a field secretary. Reagon explains her first encounter with SNCC as a confusion, for she did not understand the name, or its organization, but she claims that she understood that they were for freedom and full-time. The Freedom Singers were organized by Cordell Reagon in 1962. The group was the first of the civil rights singers to travel nationally. The singers realized that singing helped provide an outlet and unifier for protestors struggling with mob behavior and police brutality. Thanks to her roles with SNCC and the Freedom Singers, Reagon became a highly respected song leader during the Civil Rights Movement.

Activist James Forman later said: &quot;I remember seeing you lift your beautiful black head, stand squarely on your feet, your lips trembling as the melodious words &#x27;Over my head, I see freedom in the air&#x27; came forth with an urgency and a pain that brought out a sense of intense renewal and commitment of liberation. And when the call came to protest the jailings, you were up front. You led the line. Your feet hit the dirty pavement with a sureness of direction. You walked proudly onward singing &#x27;this little light of mine, &#x27;and the people echoed, &#x27;shine, shine, shine.

===Academic===
In 1974, Reagon was appointed as a cultural historian in music history at the Smithsonian Institution, where she directed a program called Black American Culture in 1976, and was later a curator of music history for the National Museum of American History. Ida Jones from the Smithsonian Institution had stated, &quot;Dr. Reagon collected photographs, sheet music, and other primary and secondary sources chronicling the development of African American sacred music tradition from its birth during the period of slavery through the creation of concert spiritual, gospel music, jazz, and the performance of protest song in the century following Emancipation,&quot; with relation to Reagon&#x27;s initial job at the museum.

In 1989, she was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship which helped her to complete the major project, &quot;Wade in the Water: African American Sacred Music Traditions&quot; (1994). After Reagon retired from singing with Sweet Honey in the Rock in 1993, she continued to work at the Smithsonian in African American Songs of Protest as a Curator Emerita. 

She also held an appointment as Distinguished Professor of history at American University (AU) in Washington DC from 1993 to 2003. Reagon was later named professor emerita of history at AU, and held the title of Curator Emerita at the Smithsonian.

===Music===
Reagon grew up in a church without a piano, so her early music was &quot;a cappella&quot;, and her first instruments were her hands and feet, and she explained, &quot;that&#x27;s the only way I can deal comfortably with creating music.&quot; When Reagon spoke about her upbringing in the musical culture, she explained that even her early schooling was heavily involved with music, not just the church. Reagon said that her teacher would lead the students outside to play games that entailed singing with their hands and feet, as well as their voices. There were also competitions among the students, and Reagon won first place as a child when running against the older students reciting Langston Hughes&#x27; poem &quot;I&#x27;ve Known Rivers&quot;.

Reagon was a specialist in African-American oral history, performance and protest traditions. She served as music consultant, producer, composer, and performer on several award-winning film projects, notably PBS television productions such as &quot;Eyes on the Prize&quot; (1987) (in which she also appeared) and Ken Burns&#x27; &quot;The Civil War&quot; (1990). Reagon was also featured in a film, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, which was about the song and its placement in the movement, being produced by Ginger Records and made by Henry Hampton, the creator of &quot;Eyes on The Prize&quot;. She was the conceptual producer and narrator of the Peabody Award-winning radio series, &quot;Wade in the Water, African American Sacred Music Traditions&quot;. Reagon claimed: &quot;These days, I come as a &#x27;songtalker&#x27;, one who balances talk and song in the creation of a live performance conversation with those who gather within the sound of my voice.&quot;

Reagon joined her first and only gospel choir when she was 11 years old, which was organized by her sister at the Mt. Early Baptist Church. She and the choir would listen to the local radio station WGPC to learn black gospel for the choir to recite. As a child, the Five Blind Guys was her favorite quartet. Reagon stated that her role models in terms of music are Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, and Bessie Jones, because they assisted her understanding of traditional singing and the fight for justice. Reagon also saw as important to her work Deacon Reardon, a historian studying African-American sacred worship traditions, and she stated that he impacted both her spiritual and musical development.

Reagon&#x27;s work as a scholar and composer was reflected in her publications on African-American culture and history, including: a collection of essays entitled &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Go, Don&#x27;t Hinder Me: The African American Sacred Song Tradition&quot; (University of Nebraska Press, 2001); &quot;We Who Believe In Freedom: Sweet Honey In The Rock: Still on the Journey&quot; (Anchor Books, 1993); and &quot;We&#x27;ll Understand It Better By And By: Pioneering African American Gospel Composers&quot; (Smithsonian Press, 1992).

Reagon recorded several albums on Folkways Records, including &quot;Folk Songs: The South&quot;, &quot;Wade in the Water&quot;, and &quot;Lest We Forget, Vol. 3: Sing for Freedom&quot;.

In 1973, Reagon founded a six-member, all-female &quot;a cappella&quot; group called Sweet Honey in the Rock. In addition to Reagon, the women in the original group were: Ysaye Maria Barnwell, Nitanju Bolade Casle, Shirley Childress Johnson, Aisha Kahil, and Carol Maillard. The only instrument they used was their voices, along with shekere and tambourine. They have toured internationally, including to Europe, Japan, Mexico, and Australia. The group&#x27;s fan base is of different ethnic backgrounds, religions, and sexual orientations. Reagon&#x27;s musical roots came from the rural South Baptist Church. She advocated &quot;music&#x27;s informational and transformative power to ask&quot; and the strong effects that music has had on the Civil Rights Movement.

==Personal life and death==
In 1963, Reagon married Cordell Reagon, another member of The Freedom Singers. Before divorcing in 1967, two children were born to this union: a daughter, (Toshi), and a son, (Kwan). Toshi Reagon is also a singer-songwriter. Kwan Reagon is a chef.

In 2003, upon receiving the prestigious Heinz Award, Reagon spoke in her acceptance speech of the decision she and her long-time partner, Adisa Douglas, made that their &quot;different and related work and struggle would move better were we joined in life partnership--and so it has been--joined and better.&quot; The two women remained together as life partners up until Reagon&#x27;s death in 2024.

Reagon died in Washington, D.C. on July 16, 2024, at the age of 81. Her death was confirmed by her daughter, Toshi Reagon, and by Courtland Cox, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee&#x27;s Legacy Project.

<text>Edwin Earl Catmull (born March 31, 1945) is an American computer scientist and animator who served as the co-founder of Pixar and the President of Walt Disney Animation Studios. He has been honored for his contributions to 3D computer graphics, including the 2019 ACM Turing Award.

==Early life==
Edwin Catmull was born on March 31, 1945, in Parkersburg, West Virginia. His family later moved to Salt Lake City, Utah, where his father first served as principal of Granite High School and then of Taylorsville High School. Born in a Mormon family, Catmull was the eldest of five brothers and, as a young man, served as a missionary in the New York City area of the 1960s.

Early in his life, Catmull found inspiration in Disney movies, including &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and &quot;Pinocchio&quot;, and wanted to be an animator; however, after finishing high school, he had no idea how to get there as there were no animation schools around that time. Because he also liked math and physics, he chose a scientific career instead. He also made animation using flip-books. Catmull graduated in 1969, with a B.S. in physics and computer science from the University of Utah. Initially interested in designing programming languages, Catmull encountered Ivan Sutherland, who had designed the computer drawing program Sketchpad, and changed his interest to digital imaging. As a student of Sutherland, he was part of the university&#x27;s DARPA program, sharing classes with James H. Clark, John Warnock and Alan Kay.

From that point, his main goal was to make feature films using advanced computer graphics, an unheard-of concept at the time. During his time at the university, he made two new fundamental computer-graphics discoveries: texture mapping and bicubic patches; and invented algorithms for spatial anti-aliasing and refining subdivision surfaces. Catmull says the idea for subdivision surfaces came from mathematical structures in his mind when he applied B-splines to non-four sided objects. He also independently discovered Z-buffering, which had been described eight months before by Wolfgang Straßer in his PhD thesis.

In 1972, Catmull made his earliest contribution to the film industry: a one-minute animated version of his left hand, titled &quot;A Computer Animated Hand&quot;, created with Fred Parke at the University of Utah. This short sequence was eventually picked up by a Hollywood producer and incorporated in the 1976 film &quot;Futureworld&quot;, which was the first film to use 3D computer graphics and a science-fiction sequel to the 1973 film &quot;Westworld&quot;, itself being the first to use a pixelated image generated by a computer. &quot;A Computer Animated Hand&quot; was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress in December 2011.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1974, Catmull earned his doctorate in computer science, and was hired by a company called Applicon. By November of that year, he had been contacted by Alexander Schure, the founder of the New York Institute of Technology, who offered him the position as the director of the institute&#x27;s new Computer Graphics Lab. In that position, in 1977, he invented Tween, software for 2D animation that automatically produced frames of motion in between two frames.

However, Catmull&#x27;s team lacked the ability to tell a story effectively via film, harming the effort to produce a motion picture via a computer. Catmull and his partner, Alvy Ray Smith, attempted to reach out to studios to alleviate this issue, but were generally unsuccessful until they attracted the attention of George Lucas at Lucasfilm.

===Lucasfilm===
Lucas approached Catmull in 1979 and asked him to lead a group to bring computer graphics, video editing, and digital audio into the entertainment field.
Lucas had already made a deal with a computer company called Triple-I, and asked them to create a digital model of an X-wing fighter from &quot;Star Wars&quot;, which they did. In 1979, Catmull became the Vice President at Industrial Light &amp; Magic computer graphics division at Lucasfilm.

===Pixar===
In 1986, Steve Jobs bought Lucasfilm&#x27;s digital division and founded Pixar, where Catmull would work. Pixar would be acquired by Disney in 2006.
In June 2007, Catmull and long-time Pixar digital animator and director John Lasseter were given control of Disneytoon Studios, a division of Disney Animation housed in a separate facility in Glendale. As president and chief creative officer, respectively, they have supervised three separate studios for Disney, each with its own production pipeline: Pixar, Disney Animation, and Disneytoon. While Disney Animation and Disneytoon are located in the Los Angeles area, Pixar is located over 350 miles (563 kilometers) northwest in the San Francisco Bay Area, where Catmull and Lasseter both live. Accordingly, they appointed a general manager for each studio to handle day-to-day affairs on their behalf, then began regularly commuting each week to both Pixar and Disney Animation and spending at least two days per week (usually Tuesdays and Wednesdays) at Disney Animation.

While at Pixar, Catmull was implicated in the High-Tech Employee Antitrust scandal, in which Bay Area technology companies allegedly agreed, among other things, not to cold-call recruit from one another. Catmull defended his actions in a deposition, saying: &quot;While I have responsibility for the payroll, I have responsibility for the long term also.&quot; Disney and its subsidiaries, including Pixar, ultimately paid $100 million in settlement compensation.

In November 2014, the general managers of Disney Animation and Pixar were both promoted to president, but both continued to report to Catmull, who retained the title of president of Walt Disney and Pixar. On October 23, 2018, Catmull announced his plans to retire from Pixar and Disney Animation, staying on as an adviser through July 2019.

=== Thatgamecompany ===
In March 2022, Thatgamecompany announced the addition of Catmull as principal adviser on creative culture and strategic growth.

== Personal life ==
As of 2006, Catmull lives in Marin County, California, with his wife, Susan Anderson, and their three children.

Catmull has an inability to form mental imagery within his head, a condition known as aphantasia.

==Awards and honors==
In 1993, Catmull received his first Academy Scientific and Technical Award from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences &quot;for the development of PhotoRealistic RenderMan software which produces images used in motion pictures from 3D computer descriptions of shape and appearance&quot;. He shared this award with Tom Porter. In 1995, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery. Again in 1996, he received an Academy Scientific and Technical Award &quot;for pioneering inventions in Digital Image Compositing&quot;.

In 2000, Catmull was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for leadership in the creation of digital imagery, leading to the introduction of fully synthetic visual effects and motion pictures.

In 2001, he received an Oscar &quot;for significant advancements to the field of motion picture rendering as exemplified in Pixar&#x27;s RenderMan&quot;. In 2006, he was awarded the IEEE John von Neumann All-Medal Crown Of Trophies for pioneering contributions to the field of computer graphics in modeling, animation and rendering. At the 81st Academy Awards (2008, presented in February 2009), Catmull was awarded the Gordon E. Sawyer Award, which honors &quot;an individual in the motion picture industry whose technological contributions have brought credit to the industry&quot;.

In 2013, the Computer History Museum named him a Museum Fellow &quot;for his pioneering work in computer graphics, animation and filmmaking&quot;.

His book &quot;Creativity, Inc.&quot; was shortlisted for the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award (2014), and was a selection for Mark Zuckerberg book club in March 2015.

Catmull shared the 2019 Turing Award with Pat Hanrahan for their pioneering work on computer-generated imagery.

<text>James Mill (born James Milne; 6 April 1773 – 23 June 1836) was a Scottish historian, economist, political theorist and philosopher. He is counted among the founders of the Ricardian school of economics. He also wrote &quot;The History of British India (1817)&quot; and was one of the prominent historians to take a colonial approach. He was the first writer to divide Indian history into three parts: Hindu, Muslim and British, a classification which has proved surpassingly influential in the field of Indian historical studies.

Mill was the father of John Stuart Mill, a noted philosopher of liberalism and utilitarianism, and a colonial administrator at the East India Company.

==Biography==
James Milne, later known as James Mill, was born in Northwater Bridge, in the parish of Logie Pert, Angus, Scotland, the son of James Milne, a shoemaker and small farmer. His mother, Isabel Fenton, of a family that had suffered from connection with the Stuart rising, resolved that he should receive a first-rate education, and after the parish school they sent him on to the Montrose Academy, where he remained until the unusual age of seventeen and a half. He then entered the University of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself as a Greek scholar.

In October 1789, he was ordained as a minister of the Church of Scotland, but met with little further success. According to John Stuart Mill&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography,&quot; his father, though &quot;educated in the creed of Scotch Presbyterianism, had, by his own studies and reflections, been early led to reject not only the belief in Revelation, but the foundations of what is commonly called Natural Religion.&quot; From 1790 to 1802, while supporting himself by various tutorships, he also pursued various historical and philosophical studies. With little prospect of a career in Scotland, in 1802, he went to London in company with Sir John Stuart of Fettercairn, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire, and devoted himself to his literary work. From 1803 to 1806, he was editor of an ambitious periodical called the &quot;Literary Journal&quot;, which tried to give a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. During this time, he also edited the &quot;St James&#x27;s Chronicle&quot;, published by the same proprietor. In 1804, he wrote a pamphlet on the corn trade, arguing against a tariff (or &#x27;bounty&#x27;) on the export of grain. In 1805, he published a translation (with notes and quotations) of &quot;An Essay on the Spirit and Influence of the Reformation of Luther&quot; by Charles de Villers on the Reformation, and an attack on the alleged vices of the papal system. About the end of this year, he began work on &quot;The History of British India&quot;, which was to occupy him for twelve years, rather than the three or four that he had expected.

In that year, too, he married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept what was then known as an establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. They took a house in Pentonville where their eldest son John Stuart Mill was born in 1806.
In 1808, he became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham, who was twenty-five years his senior and, for many years, his chief companion and ally. He adopted Bentham&#x27;s principles in their entirety, and determined to devote all his energies to bringing them before the world. Between 1806 and 1818, he wrote for the &quot;Anti-Jacobin Review&quot;, the &quot;British Review&quot; and &quot;The Eclectic Review&quot;; but there is no means of tracing his contributions. In 1808, he began to write for the more prominent Edinburgh Review, to which he contributed steadily till 1813, his first known article being &quot;Money and Exchange&quot;. He also wrote on Spanish America, China, Francisco de Miranda, the East India Company, and freedom of the press. In the &quot;Annual Review&quot; for 1808, two articles of his are traced – a &quot;Review of Fox&#x27;s History&quot;, and an article on &quot;Bentham&#x27;s Law Reforms&quot;, probably his first published notice of Bentham. In 1811, he co-operated with William Allen (1770–1843), a Quaker and chemist, in a periodical called the &quot;Philanthropist&quot;. He contributed largely to every issue – his principal topics being Education, Freedom of the Press, and Prison Discipline (under which he expounded Bentham&#x27;s Panopticon). He made powerful onslaughts on the Church in connection with the Bell and Lancaster controversy, and took a part in the discussions that led to the foundation of the University of London in 1825. In 1814, he wrote a number of articles, containing an exposition of utilitarianism, for the supplement to the fifth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, the most important being those on &quot;Jurisprudence&quot;, &quot;Prisons&quot;, &quot;Government&quot; and &quot;Law of Nations&quot;.

&quot;The History of British India&quot; was published in 1818, and obtained a great immediate and enduring success. It brought about a matching change in the author&#x27;s fortunes, and in the year following, he was appointed an official in India House in the important department of the Examiner of Indian Correspondence. He gradually rose through the ranks until, in 1830, he was appointed head of the office, with a salary of £1900, raised in 1836 to £2000. His great work on economics, the &quot;Elements of Political Economy&quot;, appeared in 1821 (3rd and revised ed. 1825).

From 1824 to 1826, Mill contributed a number of articles to &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;, the organ of the Radical party, in which he attacked the &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and the &quot;Quarterly&quot; Reviews, and the ecclesiastical establishment. In 1829, appeared the &quot;Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind&quot;. From 1831 to 1833, Mill was largely occupied in the defence of the East India Company, during the controversy attending the renewal of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of its Court of Directors. For the &quot;London Review&quot;, founded by Sir William Molesworth in 1834, he wrote a notable article entitled &quot;The Church and its Reform&quot;, which was much too sceptical for the time and injured &quot;The Westminster Review&quot;. Mill himself was an atheist. His last published book was the &quot;Fragment on Mackintosh&quot; (1835).

==Intellectual legacy==

===&quot;The History of British India&quot;===
Mill was a proponent of British imperialism, justifying it on utilitarian grounds. He considered it part of a civilising mission for Britain to impose its rule on India. Mill saw his own work for the East India Company as important for the improvement of Indian society. Mill portrayed Indian society as morally degraded and argued that Hindus had never possessed &quot;a high state of civilisation&quot;.

Mill preferred to take a more theoretical approach to social subjects than the empirical one common at the time. His best known literary work is his &quot;History of British India&quot;, in which he describes the acquisition of the Indian Empire by England and later the United Kingdom. In the work, he characterises Indian society as barbaric and Indians as incapable of self-government. He also brings political theory to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization, and subjects the conduct of the actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India to severe criticism. The work itself, and the author&#x27;s official connection with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a complete change in the whole system of governance in the country. Mill never visited the Indian colony, relying solely on documentary material and archival records in compiling his work. This fact has led to severe criticism of Mill&#x27;s &quot;History of India&quot; by notable economist Amartya Sen.

According to Thomas Trautmann, &quot;James Mill&#x27;s highly influential &quot;History of British India&quot; (1817) – most particularly the long essay &quot;Of the Hindus&quot; comprising ten chapters – is the single most important source of British Indophobia and hostility to Orientalism&quot;. In the chapter titled General Reflections in &quot;Of the Hindus&quot;, Mill wrote &quot;under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy&quot;. According to Mill, &quot;the same insincerity, mendacity, and perfidy; the same indifference to the feelings of others; the same prostitution and venality&quot; were the conspicuous characteristics of both the Hindoos and the Muslims. The Muslims, however, were perfuse, when possessed of wealth, and devoted to pleasure; the Hindoos almost always penurious and ascetic; and &quot;in truth, the Hindoo like the eunuch, excels in the qualities of a slave&quot;. Furthermore, similar to the Chinese, the Hindoos were &quot;dissembling, treacherous, mendacious, to an excess which surpasses even the usual measure of uncultivated society&quot;. Both the Chinese and the Hindoos were &quot;disposed to excessive exaggeration with regard to everything relating to themselves&quot;. Both were &quot;cowardly and unfeeling&quot;. Both were &quot;in the highest degree conceited of themselves, and full of affected contempt for others&quot;. And both were &quot;in physical sense, disgustingly unclean in their persons and houses&quot;.

Max Müller argued against the opinion that Indians were an &#x27;inferior race&#x27;, not only because such a view was wrong but because it made an Englishman&#x27;s life there a &#x27;moral exile&#x27;. One source of such mistaken notions and &#x27;poison&#x27; had been, and still was, Mill&#x27;s &quot;History of British India&quot;, which in his view was &#x27;responsible for some of the greatest misfortunes&#x27; that had happened to India. Those who were going out to rule India &#x27;should shake off national prejudices, which are apt to degenerate into a kind of madness&#x27;.

===British politics===
Mill also played a great part in British politics, and was a dominant figure in the establishment of what was called &quot;philosophic radicalism&quot;. His writings on government and his personal influence among the Liberal politicians of his time determined the change of view from the French Revolution theories of the rights of man and the absolute equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a wide extension of the franchise. It was under this banner that the Reform Bill was fought and won. His &quot;Elements of Political Economy&quot; followed up the views of his friend David Ricardo. By 1911, the Encyclopædia Britannica described it as being of mainly historical interest, &quot;an accurate summary of views that are now largely discarded&quot;. Among the more important of its theses are:
# that the chief problem of practical reformers is to limit the increase of population, on the assumption that capital does not naturally increase at the same rate as population (ii. § 2, art. 3)
# that the value of a thing depends entirely on the quantity of labour put into it; and
# that what is now known as the &quot;unearned increment&quot; of land is a proper object for taxation.

===Other areas===
By his &quot;Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind&quot; and his &quot;Fragment on Mackintosh&quot; Mill acquired a position in the history of psychology and ethics. He took up the problems of mind very much after the fashion of the Scottish Enlightenment, as then represented by Thomas Reid, Dugald Stewart and Thomas Brown, but made a new start, due in part to David Hartley, and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as the affections, the aesthetic emotions and the moral sentiment, all which he endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient merit of the &quot;Analysis&quot; is the constant endeavour after precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. He had a great effect on Franz Brentano who discussed his work in his own empirical psychology. The &quot;Fragment on Mackintosh&quot; severely criticizes the alleged flimsiness and misrepresentations of Sir James Mackintosh&#x27;s &quot;Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical Philosophy&quot; (1830), and discusses the foundations of ethics from the author&#x27;s utilitarian point of view.

<doc id="174055" wikidata="Q526790" url="?curid=174055" title="Skew-symmetric matrix">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, a skew-symmetric (or antisymmetric or antimetric) matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals its negative. That is, it satisfies the condition

In terms of the entries of the matrix, if formula_1 denotes the entry in the formula_2-th row and formula_3-th column, then the skew-symmetric condition is equivalent to

== Example ==
The matrix
:formula_4
is skew-symmetric because
: formula_5

== Properties ==
Throughout, we assume that all matrix entries belong to a field formula_6 whose characteristic is not equal to 2. That is, we assume that , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity and 0 the additive identity of the given field. If the characteristic of the field is 2, then a skew-symmetric matrix is the same thing as a symmetric matrix.

* The sum of two skew-symmetric matrices is skew-symmetric.
* A scalar multiple of a skew-symmetric matrix is skew-symmetric.
* The elements on the diagonal of a skew-symmetric matrix are zero, and therefore its trace equals zero.
* If formula_7 is a real skew-symmetric matrix and formula_8 is a real eigenvalue, then formula_9, i.e. the nonzero eigenvalues of a skew-symmetric matrix are non-real.
* If formula_7 is a real skew-symmetric matrix, then formula_11 is invertible, where formula_12 is the identity matrix.
* If formula_7 is a skew-symmetric matrix then formula_14 is a symmetric negative semi-definite matrix.

=== Vector space structure ===
As a result of the first two properties above, the set of all skew-symmetric matrices of a fixed size forms a vector space. The space of formula_15 skew-symmetric matrices has dimension formula_16

Let formula_17 denote the space of formula_15 matrices. A skew-symmetric matrix is determined by formula_19 scalars (the number of entries above the main diagonal); a symmetric matrix is determined by formula_20 scalars (the number of entries on or above the main diagonal). Let formula_21 denote the space of formula_15 skew-symmetric matrices and formula_23 denote the space of formula_15 symmetric matrices. If formula_25 then
formula_26

Notice that formula_27 and formula_28 This is true for every square matrix formula_29 with entries from any field whose characteristic is different from 2. Then, since formula_30 and formula_31 
formula_32
where formula_33 denotes the direct sum.

Denote by formula_34 the standard inner product on formula_35 The real formula_36 matrix formula_29 is skew-symmetric if and only if
formula_38

This is also equivalent to formula_39 for all formula_40 (one implication being obvious, the other a plain consequence of formula_41 for all formula_42 and formula_43).

Since this definition is independent of the choice of basis, skew-symmetry is a property that depends only on the linear operator formula_44 and a choice of inner product.

formula_45 skew symmetric matrices can be used to represent cross products as matrix multiplications.

Furthermore, if formula_44 is a skew-symmetric (or skew-Hermitian) matrix, then 
formula_47
for all formula_48.

=== Determinant ===

Let formula_44 be a formula_36 skew-symmetric matrix. The determinant of formula_44 satisfies

:formula_52

In particular, if formula_53 is odd, and since the underlying field is not of characteristic 2, the determinant vanishes. Hence, all odd dimension skew symmetric matrices are singular as their determinants are always zero. This result is called Jacobi’s theorem, after Carl Gustav Jacobi (Eves, 1980).

The even-dimensional case is more interesting. It turns out that the determinant of formula_44 for formula_53 even can be written as the square of a polynomial in the entries of formula_44, which was first proved by Cayley:

:formula_57

This polynomial is called the &quot;Pfaffian&quot; of formula_44 and is denoted formula_59. Thus the determinant of a real skew-symmetric matrix is always non-negative. However this last fact can be proved in an elementary way as follows: the eigenvalues of a real skew-symmetric matrix are purely imaginary (see below) and to every eigenvalue there corresponds the conjugate eigenvalue with the same multiplicity; therefore, as the determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, each one repeated according to its multiplicity, it follows at once that the determinant, if it is not 0, is a positive real number.

The number of distinct terms formula_60 in the expansion of the determinant of a skew-symmetric matrix of order formula_53 was considered already by Cayley, Sylvester, and Pfaff. Due to cancellations, this number is quite small as compared the number of terms of the determinant of a generic matrix of order formula_53, which is formula_63. The sequence formula_60 is
:1, 0, 1, 0, 6, 0, 120, 0, 5250, 0, 395010, 0, …

and it is encoded in the exponential generating function
:formula_65

The latter yields to the asymptotics (for formula_53 even)
:formula_67

The number of positive and negative terms are approximatively a half of the total, although their difference takes larger and larger positive and negative values as formula_53 increases .

=== Cross product ===
Three-by-three skew-symmetric matrices can be used to represent cross products as matrix multiplications. Consider vectors formula_69 and formula_70 Then, defining the matrix

: formula_71

the cross product can be written as
: formula_72

This can be immediately verified by computing both sides of the previous equation and comparing each corresponding element of the results.
One actually has
:formula_73

i.e., the commutator of skew-symmetric three-by-three matrices can be identified with the cross-product of three-vectors. Since the skew-symmetric three-by-three matrices are the Lie algebra of the rotation group formula_74 this elucidates the relation between three-space formula_75, the cross product and three-dimensional rotations. More on infinitesimal rotations can be found below.

=== Spectral theory ===

Since a matrix is similar to its own transpose, they must have the same eigenvalues. It follows that the eigenvalues of a skew-symmetric matrix always come in pairs ±λ (except in the odd-dimensional case where there is an additional unpaired 0 eigenvalue). From the spectral theorem, for a real skew-symmetric matrix the nonzero eigenvalues are all pure imaginary and thus are of the form formula_76 where each of the formula_77 are real.

Real skew-symmetric matrices are normal matrices (they commute with their adjoints) and are thus subject to the spectral theorem, which states that any real skew-symmetric matrix can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix. Since the eigenvalues of a real skew-symmetric matrix are imaginary, it is not possible to diagonalize one by a real matrix. However, it is possible to bring every skew-symmetric matrix to a block diagonal form by a special orthogonal transformation. Specifically, every formula_78 real skew-symmetric matrix can be written in the form formula_79 where formula_80 is orthogonal and
:formula_81

for real positive-definite formula_77. The nonzero eigenvalues of this matrix are ±λ&quot;k&quot; &quot;i&quot;. In the odd-dimensional case Σ always has at least one row and column of zeros.

More generally, every complex skew-symmetric matrix can be written in the form formula_83 where formula_84 is unitary and formula_85 has the block-diagonal form given above with formula_77 still real positive-definite. This is an example of the Youla decomposition of a complex square matrix.

== Skew-symmetric and alternating forms ==

A skew-symmetric form formula_87 on a vector space formula_88 over a field formula_89 of arbitrary characteristic is defined to be a bilinear form

:formula_90

such that for all formula_91 in formula_92

:formula_93

This defines a form with desirable properties for vector spaces over fields of characteristic not equal to 2, but in a vector space over a field of characteristic 2, the definition is equivalent to that of a symmetric form, as every element is its own additive inverse.

Where the vector space formula_88 is over a field of arbitrary characteristic including characteristic 2, we may define an alternating form as a bilinear form formula_87 such that for all vectors formula_96 in formula_88

:formula_98

This is equivalent to a skew-symmetric form when the field is not of characteristic 2, as seen from

:formula_99

whence

:formula_93

A bilinear form formula_87 will be represented by a matrix formula_44 such that formula_103, once a basis of formula_88 is chosen, and conversely an formula_36 matrix formula_44 on formula_107 gives rise to a form sending formula_108 to formula_109 For each of symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating forms, the representing matrices are symmetric, skew-symmetric and alternating respectively.

== Infinitesimal rotations ==
== Coordinate-free ==
More intrinsically (i.e., without using coordinates), skew-symmetric linear transformations on a vector space formula_88 with an inner product may be defined as the bivectors on the space, which are sums of simple bivectors (2-blades) formula_111 The correspondence is given by the map formula_112 where formula_113 is the covector dual to the vector formula_114; in orthonormal coordinates these are exactly the elementary skew-symmetric matrices. This characterization is used in interpreting the curl of a vector field (naturally a 2-vector) as an infinitesimal rotation or &quot;curl&quot;, hence the name.

== Skew-symmetrizable matrix ==
An formula_36 matrix formula_44 is said to be skew-symmetrizable if there exists an invertible diagonal matrix formula_117 such that formula_118 is skew-symmetric. For real formula_36 matrices, sometimes the condition for formula_117 to have positive entries is added.

<text>&#x27; (provisional designation &#x27;) is a risk-listed asteroid, classified as a near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo group, approximately in diameter. It once had the highest known probability of impacting Earth. In 2002, it had the highest Palermo scale rating with a value of 0.17 and a probability of 1 in 306 (0.33%) for a possible collision in 2880. Since that time, the estimated risk has been updated several times. In December 2015, the odds of an Earth impact were revised to 1 in 8,300 (0.012%) with a Palermo scale rating of −1.42. , it is listed on the Sentry Risk Table with the highest cumulative Palermo scale rating of −0.92. is not assigned a Torino scale rating, because the 2880 date is over 100 years in the future. As of 2 February 2025, the odds of an Earth impact are 1 in 2,600 (0.039%).

== Discovery and nomenclature ==
 was first discovered on 23 February 1950 by Carl A. Wirtanen at Lick Observatory. It was observed for seventeen days and then lost because this short observation arc resulted in large uncertainties in Wirtanen&#x27;s orbital solution. On 31 December 2000, it was recovered at Lowell Observatory and was announced as on 4 January 2001. Just two hours later it was recognized as .

== Observations ==
On 5 March 2001, made a close approach to Earth at a distance of . It was studied by radar at the Goldstone and Arecibo observatories from March 3 to 7, 2001.

The studies showed that the asteroid has a mean diameter of 1.1 km, assuming that is a retrograde rotator. Optical lightcurve analysis by Lenka Šarounová and Petr Pravec shows that its rotation period is hours. Due to its short rotation period and high radar albedo, is thought to be fairly dense (more than 3.5 g/cm3, assuming that it has no internal strength) and likely composed of nickel–iron. In August 2014, scientists from the University of Tennessee determined that &quot;&quot; is a rubble pile rotating faster than the breakup limit for its density, implying the asteroid is held together by van der Waals forces rather than gravity.

 made distant approaches to Earth on 20 May 2012, 5 February 2021 and 5 February 2023. However, at these times it was a quarter to half an AU away from Earth, preventing more useful astrometrics and timing that occurs when an object is closer to Earth. The next close approach that presents a good opportunity to observe the asteroid will be on 2 March 2032, when it will be from Earth. The following table lists the approaches closer than 0.1 AU until the year 2500. By 2136 the close approach solutions are becoming notably more divergent.


== Possible Earth impact ==
 has one of the best-determined asteroid orbital solutions. This is due to a combination of:
* an orbit moderately inclined (12 degrees) to the ecliptic plane (reducing in-plane perturbations);
* high-precision radar astrometry, which provides its distance and is complementary to the measurements of angular positions;
* a 74-year observation arc;
* an uncertainty region controlled by resonance.

Main-belt asteroid 78 Diana (~125 km in diameter) will pass about from on 5 August 2150. At that distance and size, Diana will perturb enough so that the change in trajectory is notable by 2880 (730 years later). In addition, over the intervening time, &#x27;s rotation will cause its orbit to slightly change as a result of the Yarkovsky effect. If continues on its present orbit, it may approach Earth on 16 March 2880, though the mean trajectory passes many millions of kilometres from Earth, so does not have a significant chance of impacting Earth. , according to the latest solution dated 2 February 2025, the probability of an impact in 2880 is 1 in 2,600 (0.039%).

The energy released by a collision with an object the size of would cause major effects on the climate and biosphere, which would be devastating to human civilization. The discovery of the potential impact heightened interest in asteroid deflection strategies.
