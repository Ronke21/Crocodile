<text>D. Napier &amp; Son Limited was a British engineering company best known for its luxury motor cars in the Edwardian era and for its aero engines throughout the early to mid-20th century.

Napier was founded as a precision engineering company in 1808 and for nearly a century produced machinery for the financial, print, and munitions industries. In the early 20th century it moved for a time into internal combustion engines and road vehicles before turning to aero engines. Its powerful Lion dominated the UK market in the 1920s and the Second World War era Sabre produced in its later versions. Many world speed records on land and water, as well as the Hawker Typhoon and Tempest fighter planes, were powered by Napier engines. During the Second World War the company was taken over by English Electric, and engine manufacture eventually ceased. Today, Napier Turbochargers is a subsidiary of the American company Wabtec.

==History==

===Early years and precision engineering===
David Napier, second son of the blacksmith to the Duke of Argyll, was born in 1785. While cousins became shipbuilders, he took engineering training in Scotland before coming to London. There in 1808 he founded the firm that was to become D. Napier &amp; Son in Lloyds Court, St Giles, London. He designed a steam-powered printing press, some of which went to Hansard (the printer and publisher of proceedings of the Houses of Parliament), as well as newspapers. The company moved to Lambeth, South London, in 1830.

Between 1840 and 1860, Napier was prosperous, with a well-outfitted factory and between 200 and 300 workers. Napier made a wide variety of products, including a centrifuge for sugar manufacturing, lathes and drills, ammunition-making equipment for the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, and railway cranes. David&#x27;s younger son James Murdoch Napier, born 1823, joined the firm in 1837 and became a partner in 1847, resulting in a change in the private company&#x27;s name to D. Napier &amp; Son.

James succeeded his father as head of the firm in 1867, and after his father&#x27;s death in 1873, specialized in crafted precision machinery for making coins, and printing stamps and banknotes. James proved an excellent engineer, but a poor businessman, considering salesmanship undignified. His company&#x27;s fortunes went so bad that there were as few as seven employees in 1895, and James attempted to sell the business, but failed.

===Montague Napier and high-performance vehicles===
James&#x27; son Montague, born 1870, inherited the business in 1895, along with his father&#x27;s engineering talents. Montague was a hobby racing cyclist, and at the Bath Road Club, he met &quot;ebullient Australian&quot; S. F. Edge (then a manager at Dunlop Rubber and colleague of H. J. Lawson in London, and amateur racer of motor tricycles.) Edge persuaded Napier to improve his Panhard &quot;Old Number 8&quot; (which had won the 1896 Paris–Marseille–Paris), converting from a tiller to a steering wheel and improving the oiling.

Dissatisfied, Napier offered to fit an engine of his own design, an 8 hp vertical twin, with electric ignition, superior to the Panhard&#x27;s hot tube type. Edge was sufficiently impressed to encourage Napier to make his own car and collaborated with Harvey du Cros, his former boss at Dunlop, to form the Motor Power Company, based in London, which agreed to buy Napier&#x27;s entire output. The first of an initial order of six, three each two-cylinder 8 hp and four-cylinder 16 hp, all with aluminum bodies by Arthur Mulliner of Northampton and chain drive, was delivered 31 March 1900; Edge paid £400 and sold at £500.

In 1903 the manufacturing business moved from Lambeth to larger premises in Acton and in 1906 it became a limited liability company, D. Napier &amp; Son Limited, although it remained in effect a private company for the next few years.

Outside the racing programme, Napier also gained fame in 1904 by being the first car to cross the Canadian Rockies: Mr and Mrs Charles Glidden, sponsors of the Glidden Tours, covered from Boston to Vancouver.

====Racing====
Recognizing the value of publicity gained from racing, which no other British marque did, in spring, Edge entered an Napier in the Thousand Miles (1,600 km) Trial of the Automobile Club on behalf of Mary Eliza Kennard; driven by Edge, with Kennard along, on a circuit from Newbury to Edinburgh and back, it won its class, being one of only thirty-five finishers (of sixty-four starters) and one of just twelve to average the requisite in England and in Scotland.

By June 1900, eight &quot;16 hp&quot;s had been ordered, and Edge entered one in the Paris-Toulouse-Paris race, with Charles S. Rolls (co-founder of Rolls-Royce) as riding mechanic. The () sidevalve suffered problems with its ignition coils and cooling system, and failed to finish.

For 1901, Montague designed a car sure not to lack speed, having a () sidevalve four capable of at 800 rpm, on a wheelbase of with four-speed gearbox and chain drive. Called the &quot;50 hp&quot;, only two or three were completed, including one for Rolls. Edge entered one in the 1901 Gordon Bennett Cup, only able to test it &quot;en route&quot; (it was completed 25 May, only four days before the event), Montague serving as his riding mechanic; it overpowered its Dunlops, and fitting new (French) tyres led to disqualification, since they were not of the same nation of origin. In the concurrent Paris-Bordeaux rally, it retired with clutch trouble.

For the 1902 Gordon Bennett, three entrants (the Charron-Girardot-Voigt, a Mors and a Panhard) contested for France, with Edge in a Napier and two Wolseleys. The Napier was a three-speed, shaft-drive 6.44-litre (392.7 cu in) four ( of (though described as a 30 hp). Piloted by Edge and his cousin, Cecil, it wore what would become known as British racing green, and won at an average ; although by default, since all other entrants retired during the race. It was the first British victory in international motorsport, and would not be repeated until Henry Segrave took the French Grand Prix in 1923.
Napiers also inspired Charles J. Glidden to create the Glidden Tours in upstate New York, which in turn persuaded Napier to build a factory in Boston. It, along with the Genoa factory (managed by Arthur McDonald), which built Napiers under licence as San Giorgios from 1906 to 1909, was not a success.

Annual production reached 250 cars in 1903, overwhelming the Lambeth factory, so a move was made to a new plant at Acton, in west London. On 16 October of that year, Napier announced a six-cylinder car for 1904 and became the first manufacturer to make a commercially successful six, a &quot;remarkably smooth and flexible&quot; vehicle 18 hp 301 cu in (4.9-litre) ( with a three-speed gearbox and chain drive. Within five years, there were 62 makers of six-cylinder cars in Britain alone, including the Ford Motor Company&#x27;s 1906 Model K.
Napier&#x27;s 1902 win brought the Gordon Bennett hosting duties to the United Kingdom, and the 1903 event was held south of Dublin, with three shaft-driven Napiers defending the British honour, all in the (later famous) racing green: two 470 cubic inch (7708 cc) fours for Charles Jarrott and J. W. Stocks, with McDonald, the Genoa plant manager, his riding mechanic, and an 80-horsepower (838 cubic inch, 13,726 cc), the Type K5, for Edge. Jarrott and Stocks crashed, and Edge was disqualified. It was a bad year for Napier&#x27;s racing programme; a 35 hp in the hands of Colonel Mark Mayhew in the Paris–Madrid rally lost its steering and hit a tree. Edge, again with McDonald, fared no better with the K5 in the 1904 Gordon Bennett in Germany, but a new 920 cubic inch (15-litre; 158.7 × 127 mm, 6.25 × 5-inch) six, the L48, with an external radiator reminiscent of the Cord 810, set the fastest time at the Velvet Strand speed trials at Portmarnock, Ireland, in September, piloted by McDonald.

In January 1905, the L48, again with McDonald in the seat, took the mile (1.6 km) record at Ormonde Beach at ; although this was shortly broken by Bowden&#x27;s Mercedes, the run was disallowed. The versatile McDonald ran the L48 in the 1905 Gordon Bennett qualifying event at the Isle of Man, taken over for the race by works driver Clifford Earp, who placed ninth.

Edge&#x27;s secretary, Dorothy Levitt, drove a development of the K5 at the Blackpool and Brighton Speed Trials in 1905, and the next year ran the L48 at the Blackpool Speed Trials, showing talent by equalling Edge&#x27;s speed and setting a women&#x27;s record in the flying kilometre of .

By 1907, 1200 people were employed by Napier and were making about a hundred cars a year, aided by continuing racing success. Brooklands opened that year, where Napier engineer H. C. Tryon won the first ever event in a , and Edge made a famous 24-hour run in June, covering at an average in a 60-horsepower 589 cubic inch (9,652 cc) (127 × 127 mm, 5 × 5-inch) six, a record which stood for 18 years. The L48, nicknamed &quot;Samson&quot;, became famous there in the venue&#x27;s first two years; in 1908, Napier&#x27;s Frank Newton covered at in a stroked (178 mm, 7-inch) L48.

The company&#x27;s last race win was with a four-cylinder at the 1908 Tourist Trophy, using an alias, Hutton, to preserve the reputation of the sixes, in the hands of Willy Watson. At the French Grand Prix, officials showed the perverse reasoning for which they later became notorious by claiming that removable wire wheels were an unfair advantage.

When Napier was no longer in racing, its Lion aero engine was used by several land speed record contestants: Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s Napier-Campbell Blue Bird of 1927 and Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931, Segrave&#x27;s &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; of 1929, and John Cobb&#x27;s Napier-Railton and Railton Mobil Special, which held the record from 1939 to 1964.


====Motor yachting====
Napier expanded into marine engines and launches. In 1903 a S. F. Edge&#x27;s Napier launch won the inaugural British International Harmsworth Trophy for speedboats at Cork Harbour in Ireland, driven by Dorothy Levitt. She achieved in a steel-hulled, speedboat fitted with a 3-blade propeller. As both the owner and entrant of the boat, &quot;S. F. Edge&quot; is engraved on the trophy as the winner. The third crew member, Campbell Muir, may also have taken the controls.

On 8 August 1903 Levitt drove the Napier at Cowes and won the race. She was then commanded to the royal yacht by King Edward VII where he congratulated her on her pluck and skill, and they discussed the performance of the boat and its potential for British government despatch work.

Later in August Levitt won the Gaston Menier Cup at Trouville, France. This was described as the &quot;five-mile world&#x27;s championship of the sea&quot; and the prize was $1,750.

In October 1903 Levitt won the Championship of the Seas at Trouville, and the French government bought the boat for £1,000.

The 1905 boat &quot;Napier II&quot; set the world water speed record for a mile at almost 30 knots (56 km/h).

===Public limited company and WWI===

In 1912, following a dispute with Edge, the business was restructured. D. Napier &amp; Son Limited went public and bought out Edge&#x27;s distribution and sales company, S.F. Edge (1907) Limited. The latter soon went into voluntary liquidation and thus the manufacture and marketing of Napier cars were united under a single organization. Production rose to around 700 cars a year with many supplied to the London taxi trade. That year, only six models were produced.

On the outbreak of war sales of private vehicles collapsed and Napier turned to military orders. Vehicle production continued for a time on this basis and 2,000 trucks and ambulances were supplied to the War Office. Montague Napier&#x27;s health declined and in 1917 he moved to Cannes, France, but continued to take an active involvement in the company until his death in 1931.

Early in the war, Napier was contracted to build engines from other companies&#x27; designs: initially the model RAF 3, a V-12 by Royal Aircraft Factory, and then the V-8 Sunbeam Arab. Both proved to be rather unreliable, and in 1916 Napier decided to design its own instead, an effort that led to the superb W-block 12-cylinder Lion. The Lion came into service shortly before the end of the war.

During the First World War the company was also contracted to build 600 aircraft at the Acton factory (50 Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.7, 400 Royal Aircraft Factory R.E.8 and 150 Sopwith Snipes). Together with the engine work, this required enormous expansion of the company.

===Interwar period===

By the end of the war, military production had tailed off and the Lion was still barely in use.

In 1919 civilian car production was recommenced. The T75 motor car would be Napier&#x27;s last. Designed by A. J. Rowledge (who left for Rolls-Royce in 1921), its engine was a 40–50 hp () alloy six with detachable cylinder head, single overhead camshaft, seven-bearing crankshaft, dual magneto and coil ignition, dual plugs, and Napier-SU Carburettor. Coachwork was by Cunard, by then a subsidiary. 187 were built in all by 1924, and Napier quit car production with a total of 4,258 built. The car was very expensive, costing about the same as a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and in the early 1920s sales were slow. The last car was sold in 1924.

The Lion was by now becoming a best-seller for the company, which eventually dropped all the other aero-engines. The Lion went on to be adapted for land and water, to set the land speed record in Malcolm Campbell&#x27;s Napier-Campbell Blue Bird of 1927 and Campbell-Napier-Railton Blue Bird of 1931 and Henry Segrave&#x27;s &quot;Golden Arrow&quot; of 1931 and later in John Cobb&#x27;s Napier-Railton and Railton Mobil Special, which held the record from 1939 to 1964.

In the 1930s the introduction of much larger and more powerful aero-engines from other companies ended sales of the Lion. Napier quickly started work on newer designs, building on experience gained on the X style 16-cylinder, Cub, used in the Blackburn Cubaroo single-engined bomber of the 1920s, and the resulting later 16-cylinder Rapier and 24-cylinder Dagger were both air-cooled H-block designs. Neither the Rapier nor the Dagger proved very reliable, due to poor cooling of the rearmost cylinders, and even the Dagger&#x27;s was less than its competitors&#x27; offerings when shipped.

As Lion sales faded, an attempt was also made to buy the bankrupt Bentley company in 1931 but Napier was outbid at the last minute by Rolls-Royce. The last vehicle project was a three-wheeled tractor-trailer goods vehicle, but rather than produce this itself, the design was sold to Scammell, which made several thousand.

===Second World War===

Starting from scratch, Napier decided to use the new sleeve valve design in a much larger H-block 24-cylinder engine, soon to be known as the Sabre. Designed under Frank Halford, the engine was very advanced and proved to be difficult to adapt to assembly line production. Therefore, although the engine was ready by 1940, it was not until 1944 that production versions were considered reliable. At that point efforts were made to improve it, leading eventually to the Sabre VII delivering , making it the most powerful engine in the world, from an engine much smaller than its competition.

Napier also worked on diesel aircraft engines. In the 1930s it licensed the Junkers Jumo 204 for production in England, which it called the Culverin. It also planned to produce a smaller version of the same basic design as the Cutlass, but work on both was cancelled at the outbreak of war in 1939.

Napier developed a marine engine from the Lion aero engine, the petrol-driven Sea Lion, which could deliver and was used in the &quot;Whaleback&quot; Air Sea Rescue Launches.

During the war (1944) Napier was asked by the Royal Navy to supply a diesel engine for use in its patrol boats, but the Culverin&#x27;s was not nearly enough for its needs. Napier then designed under the leadership of Ernest Edward Chatterton, Chief Engineer, the Deltic, essentially three Culverins arranged in a large triangle. Considered one of the most complex engine designs of its day, the Deltic was nevertheless very reliable, and was taken into service after the war as a locomotive powerplant (in British Rail&#x27;s Class 55) in addition to the torpedo boats, minesweepers and other small naval vessels for which it was designed.

Also during the Second World War a six-cylinder 300 cubic inch road-vehicle engine was commissioned by the government, but this design was sold to Leyland Motors by 1945.

===Post-war===

====English Electric====
Napier had been taken over by English Electric on 23 November 1942.

Last of the great Napier internal combustion engines was the Nomad, a complex &quot;turbo-compound&quot; design that combined a diesel engine with a turbine to recover energy otherwise lost in the exhaust. The advantage of this complex design was fuel economy: it had the best specific fuel consumption of any aircraft engine, even to this day. However, even better fuel economy could be had by flying a normal jet engine at much higher altitudes, while existing designs filled the &quot;low end&quot; of the market fairly well. First run in 1949, the Nomad I underwent radical redesign for the Nomad II but was largely ignored by the market and was cancelled in 1955.

Along with every major aero engine company in the post-war era, Napier turned to the jet turbine. Seeing a niche not yet adopted up by the larger vendors, Napier developed a number of turboshaft designs which saw some use, notably in helicopters. Its first design, the Naiad and Double Naiad was developed for various Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm projects, but did not enter production. The smaller models developed later, the 3,000-hp-class Eland and 1,500-hp-class Gazelle did somewhat better, notably the Gazelle which powered several models of the popular Westland Wessex helicopter. Production ceased when a deal was struck with Rolls-Royce in 1961.

At the same time, the ramjet was showing promise for high-speed supersonic flight. From 1951 Napier developed a successful large-diameter experimental engine, the Napier Ram Jet (NRJ). Napier continued in ramjet development for several years, typically working alongside the English Electric aircraft design team.

===Napier Aero Engines Limited===

In 1961 a new company &quot;Napier Aero Engines Limited&quot; was formed by D. Napier &amp; Son and Rolls-Royce, to take over the Napier aero-engine business and the Acton engine factory. It was to continue to market the Gazelle, while the completion of existing Gazelle contracts and the Eland remained the financial responsibility of the old company. But it closed only two years later, in 1963.

Following the move of the aero engine business, D. Napier &amp; Son continued as a subsidiary of English Electric. With the ending of Deltic sales in the 1960s it had no new modern engine designs to offer. Today Napier is no longer in the engine business.

===Napier Turbochargers===
GEC bought English Electric in the late 1960s. The GEC operation, now part of Ruston Gas Turbines, later moved to GEC-Alsthom and then Alstom, before being sold to Siemens in March 2003.

&quot;Napier Turbochargers&quot; was bought from Siemens in June 2008 in a management buyout. The buyout was funded by the private equity company Primary Capital for around £100 million.

Early in 2013 Napier Turbochargers became part of Wabtec. Napier Turbochargers currently produces turbochargers for the marine, power, and rail industries, employing around 150 people.

<text>Dispersion is the phenomenon in which the phase velocity of a wave depends on its frequency. Sometimes the term chromatic dispersion is used to refer to optics specifically, as opposed to wave propagation in general. A medium having this common property may be termed a dispersive medium.

Although the term is used in the field of optics to describe light and other electromagnetic waves, dispersion in the same sense can apply to any sort of wave motion such as acoustic dispersion in the case of sound and seismic waves, and in gravity waves (ocean waves). Within optics, dispersion is a property of telecommunication signals along transmission lines (such as microwaves in coaxial cable) or the pulses of light in optical fiber.

In optics, one important and familiar consequence of dispersion is the change in the angle of refraction of different colors of light, as seen in the spectrum produced by a dispersive prism and in chromatic aberration of lenses. Design of compound achromatic lenses, in which chromatic aberration is largely cancelled, uses a quantification of a glass&#x27;s dispersion given by its Abbe number &quot;V&quot;, where &quot;lower&quot; Abbe numbers correspond to &quot;greater&quot; dispersion over the visible spectrum. In some applications such as telecommunications, the absolute phase of a wave is often not important but only the propagation of wave packets or &quot;pulses&quot;; in that case one is interested only in variations of group velocity with frequency, so-called group-velocity dispersion.

All common transmission media also vary in attenuation (normalized to transmission length) as a function of frequency, leading to attenuation distortion; this is not dispersion, although sometimes reflections at closely spaced impedance boundaries (e.g. crimped segments in a cable) can produce signal distortion which further aggravates inconsistent transit time as observed across signal bandwidth.

== Examples ==
The most familiar example of dispersion is probably a rainbow, in which dispersion causes the spatial separation of a white light into components of different wavelengths (different colors). However, dispersion also has an effect in many other circumstances: for example, group-velocity dispersion causes pulses to spread in optical fibers, degrading signals over long distances; also, a cancellation between group-velocity dispersion and nonlinear effects leads to soliton waves.

== Material and waveguide dispersion ==
Most often, chromatic dispersion refers to bulk material dispersion, that is, the change in refractive index with optical frequency. However, in a waveguide there is also the phenomenon of &quot;waveguide dispersion&quot;, in which case a wave&#x27;s phase velocity in a structure depends on its frequency simply due to the structure&#x27;s geometry. More generally, &quot;waveguide&quot; dispersion can occur for waves propagating through any inhomogeneous structure (e.g., a photonic crystal), whether or not the waves are confined to some region. In a waveguide, &quot;both&quot; types of dispersion will generally be present, although they are not strictly additive. For example, in fiber optics the material and waveguide dispersion can effectively cancel each other out to produce a zero-dispersion wavelength, important for fast fiber-optic communication.

== Material dispersion in optics ==

Material dispersion can be a desirable or undesirable effect in optical applications. The dispersion of light by glass prisms is used to construct spectrometers and spectroradiometers. However, in lenses, dispersion causes chromatic aberration, an undesired effect that may degrade images in microscopes, telescopes, and photographic objectives.

The &quot;phase velocity&quot; &quot;v&quot; of a wave in a given uniform medium is given by
: formula_1
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, and &quot;n&quot; is the refractive index of the medium.

In general, the refractive index is some function of the frequency &quot;f&quot; of the light, thus &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;f&quot;), or alternatively, with respect to the wave&#x27;s wavelength &quot;n&quot; = &quot;n&quot;(&quot;λ&quot;). The wavelength dependence of a material&#x27;s refractive index is usually quantified by its Abbe number or its coefficients in an empirical formula such as the Cauchy or Sellmeier equations.

Because of the Kramers–Kronig relations, the wavelength dependence of the real part of the refractive index is related to the material absorption, described by the imaginary part of the refractive index (also called the extinction coefficient). In particular, for non-magnetic materials (&quot;μ&quot; = &quot;μ&quot;0), the susceptibility &quot;χ&quot; that appears in the Kramers–Kronig relations is the electric susceptibility &quot;χ&quot;e = &quot;n&quot;2 − 1.

The most commonly seen consequence of dispersion in optics is the separation of white light into a color spectrum by a prism. From Snell&#x27;s law it can be seen that the angle of refraction of light in a prism depends on the refractive index of the prism material. Since that refractive index varies with wavelength, it follows that the angle that the light is refracted by will also vary with wavelength, causing an angular separation of the colors known as &quot;angular dispersion&quot;.

For visible light, refraction indices &quot;n&quot; of most transparent materials (e.g., air, glasses) decrease with increasing wavelength &quot;λ&quot;:
: formula_2
or generally,
: formula_3

In this case, the medium is said to have &quot;normal dispersion&quot;. Whereas if the index increases with increasing wavelength (which is typically the case in the ultraviolet), the medium is said to have &quot;anomalous dispersion&quot;.

At the interface of such a material with air or vacuum (index of ~1), Snell&#x27;s law predicts that light incident at an angle &quot;θ&quot; to the normal will be refracted at an angle arcsin(). Thus, blue light, with a higher refractive index, will be bent more strongly than red light, resulting in the well-known rainbow pattern.

== Group-velocity dispersion ==

Beyond simply describing a change in the phase velocity over wavelength, a more serious consequence of dispersion in many applications is termed group-velocity dispersion (GVD). While phase velocity &quot;v&quot; is defined as &quot;v&quot; = &quot;c&quot;/&quot;n&quot;, this describes only one frequency component. When different frequency components are combined, as when considering a signal or a pulse, one is often more interested in the group velocity, which describes the speed at which a pulse or information superimposed on a wave (modulation) propagates. In the accompanying animation, it can be seen that the wave itself (orange-brown) travels at a phase velocity much faster than the speed of the &quot;envelope&quot; (black), which corresponds to the group velocity. This pulse might be a communications signal, for instance, and its information only travels at the group velocity rate, even though it consists of wavefronts advancing at a faster rate (the phase velocity).

It is possible to calculate the group velocity from the refractive-index curve &quot;n&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) or more directly from the wavenumber &quot;k&quot; = &quot;ωn&quot;/&quot;c&quot;, where &quot;ω&quot; is the radian frequency &quot;ω&quot; = 2&quot;πf&quot;. Whereas one expression for the phase velocity is &quot;v&quot;p = &quot;ω&quot;/&quot;k&quot;, the group velocity can be expressed using the derivative: &quot;v&quot;g = &quot;dω&quot;/&quot;dk&quot;. Or in terms of the phase velocity &quot;v&quot;p,

: formula_4

When dispersion is present, not only the group velocity is not equal to the phase velocity, but generally it itself varies with wavelength. This is known as group-velocity dispersion and causes a short pulse of light to be broadened, as the different-frequency components within the pulse travel at different velocities. Group-velocity dispersion is quantified as the derivative of the &quot;reciprocal&quot; of the group velocity with respect to angular frequency, which results in &quot;group-velocity dispersion&quot; = &quot;d&quot;2&quot;k&quot;/&quot;dω&quot;2.

If a light pulse is propagated through a material with positive group-velocity dispersion, then the shorter-wavelength components travel slower than the longer-wavelength components. The pulse therefore becomes &quot;positively chirped&quot;, or &quot;up-chirped&quot;, increasing in frequency with time. On the other hand, if a pulse travels through a material with negative group-velocity dispersion, shorter-wavelength components travel faster than the longer ones, and the pulse becomes &quot;negatively chirped&quot;, or &quot;down-chirped&quot;, decreasing in frequency with time.

An everyday example of a negatively chirped signal in the acoustic domain is that of an approaching train hitting deformities on a welded track. The sound caused by the train itself is impulsive and travels much faster in the metal tracks than in air, so that the train can be heard well before it arrives. However, from afar it is not heard as causing impulses, but leads to a distinctive descending chirp, amidst reverberation caused by the complexity of the vibrational modes of the track. Group-velocity dispersion can be heard in that the volume of the sounds stays audible for a surprisingly long time, up to several seconds.

== Dispersion control ==

The result of GVD, whether negative or positive, is ultimately temporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems based on optical fiber, since if dispersion is too high, a group of pulses representing a bit-stream will spread in time and merge, rendering the bit-stream unintelligible. This limits the length of fiber that a signal can be sent down without regeneration. One possible answer to this problem is to send signals down the optical fibre at a wavelength where the GVD is zero (e.g., around 1.3–1.5 μm in silica fibres), so pulses at this wavelength suffer minimal spreading from dispersion. In practice, however, this approach causes more problems than it solves because zero GVD unacceptably amplifies other nonlinear effects (such as four-wave mixing). Another possible option is to use soliton pulses in the regime of negative dispersion, a form of optical pulse which uses a nonlinear optical effect to self-maintain its shape. Solitons have the practical problem, however, that they require a certain power level to be maintained in the pulse for the nonlinear effect to be of the correct strength. Instead, the solution that is currently used in practice is to perform dispersion compensation, typically by matching the fiber with another fiber of opposite-sign dispersion so that the dispersion effects cancel; such compensation is ultimately limited by nonlinear effects such as self-phase modulation, which interact with dispersion to make it very difficult to undo.

Dispersion control is also important in lasers that produce short pulses. The overall dispersion of the optical resonator is a major factor in determining the duration of the pulses emitted by the laser. A pair of prisms can be arranged to produce net negative dispersion, which can be used to balance the usually positive dispersion of the laser medium. Diffraction gratings can also be used to produce dispersive effects; these are often used in high-power laser amplifier systems. Recently, an alternative to prisms and gratings has been developed: chirped mirrors. These dielectric mirrors are coated so that different wavelengths have different penetration lengths, and therefore different group delays. The coating layers can be tailored to achieve a net negative dispersion.

== In waveguides ==
Waveguides are highly dispersive due to their geometry (rather than just to their material composition). Optical fibers are a sort of waveguide for optical frequencies (light) widely used in modern telecommunications systems. The rate at which data can be transported on a single fiber is limited by pulse broadening due to chromatic dispersion among other phenomena.

In general, for a waveguide mode with an angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) at a propagation constant &quot;β&quot; (so that the electromagnetic fields in the propagation direction &quot;z&quot; oscillate proportional to &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;βz&quot;−&quot;ωt&quot;)), the group-velocity dispersion parameter &quot;D&quot; is defined as
: formula_5

where &quot;λ&quot; = 2&quot;c&quot;/&quot;ω&quot; is the vacuum wavelength, and &quot;v&quot;g = &quot;dω&quot;/&quot;dβ&quot; is the group velocity. This formula generalizes the one in the previous section for homogeneous media and includes both waveguide dispersion and material dispersion. The reason for defining the dispersion in this way is that |&quot;D&quot;| is the (asymptotic) temporal pulse spreading Δ&quot;t&quot; per unit bandwidth
Δ&quot;λ&quot; per unit distance travelled, commonly reported in ps/(nm⋅km) for optical fibers.

In the case of multi-mode optical fibers, so-called modal dispersion will also lead to pulse broadening. Even in single-mode fibers, pulse broadening can occur as a result of polarization mode dispersion (since there are still two polarization modes). These are &quot;not&quot; examples of chromatic dispersion, as they are not dependent on the wavelength or bandwidth of the pulses propagated.

== Higher-order dispersion over broad bandwidths ==
When a broad range of frequencies (a broad bandwidth) is present in a single wavepacket, such as in an ultrashort pulse or a chirped pulse or other forms of spread spectrum transmission, it may not be accurate to approximate the dispersion by a constant over the entire bandwidth, and more complex calculations are required to compute effects such as pulse spreading.

In particular, the dispersion parameter &quot;D&quot; defined above is obtained from only one derivative of the group velocity. Higher derivatives are known as &quot;higher-order dispersion&quot;. These terms are simply a Taylor series expansion of the dispersion relation &quot;β&quot;(&quot;ω&quot;) of the medium or waveguide around some particular frequency. Their effects can be computed via numerical evaluation of Fourier transforms of the waveform, via integration of higher-order slowly varying envelope approximations, by a split-step method (which can use the exact dispersion relation rather than a Taylor series), or by direct simulation of the full Maxwell&#x27;s equations rather than an approximate envelope equation.

== Spatial dispersion ==
In electromagnetics and optics, the term &quot;dispersion&quot; generally refers to aforementioned temporal or frequency dispersion. Spatial dispersion refers to the non-local response of the medium to the space; this can be reworded as the wavevector dependence of the permittivity. For an exemplary anisotropic medium, the spatial relation between electric and electric displacement field can be expressed as a convolution:

: formula_6

where the kernel formula_7 is dielectric response (susceptibility); its indices make it in general a tensor to account for the anisotropy of the medium. Spatial dispersion is negligible in most macroscopic cases, where the scale of variation of formula_8 is much larger than atomic dimensions, because the dielectric kernel dies out at macroscopic distances. Nevertheless, it can result in non-negligible macroscopic effects, particularly in conducting media such as metals, electrolytes and plasmas. Spatial dispersion also plays role in optical activity and Doppler broadening, as well as in the theory of metamaterials.

== In gemology ==
In the technical terminology of gemology, &quot;dispersion&quot; is the difference in the refractive index of a material at the B and G (686.7 nm and 430.8 nm) or C and F (656.3 nm and 486.1 nm) Fraunhofer wavelengths, and is meant to express the degree to which a prism cut from the gemstone demonstrates &quot;fire&quot;. Fire is a colloquial term used by gemologists to describe a gemstone&#x27;s dispersive nature or lack thereof. Dispersion is a material property. The amount of fire demonstrated by a given gemstone is a function of the gemstone&#x27;s facet angles, the polish quality, the lighting environment, the material&#x27;s refractive index, the saturation of color, and the orientation of the viewer relative to the gemstone.

== In imaging ==
In photographic and microscopic lenses, dispersion causes chromatic aberration, which causes the different colors in the image not to overlap properly. Various techniques have been developed to counteract this, such as the use of achromats, multielement lenses with glasses of different dispersion. They are constructed in such a way that the chromatic aberrations of the different parts cancel out.

== Pulsar emissions ==

Pulsars are spinning neutron stars that emit pulses at very regular intervals ranging from milliseconds to seconds. Astronomers believe that the pulses are emitted simultaneously over a wide range of frequencies. However, as observed on Earth, the components of each pulse emitted at higher radio frequencies arrive before those emitted at lower frequencies. This dispersion occurs because of the ionized component of the interstellar medium, mainly the free electrons, which make the group velocity frequency-dependent. The extra delay added at a frequency is
: formula_9
where the dispersion constant &quot;k&quot;DM is given by
: formula_10
and the dispersion measure (DM) is the column density of free electrons (total electron content) i.e. the number density of electrons &quot;n&quot;e integrated along the path traveled by the photon from the pulsar to the Earth and is given by
: formula_11
with units of parsecs per cubic centimetre (1 pc/cm3 = 30.857 m−2).

Typically for astronomical observations, this delay cannot be measured directly, since the emission time is unknown. What &quot;can&quot; be measured is the difference in arrival times at two different frequencies. The delay Δ&quot;t&quot; between a high-frequency hi and a low-frequency lo component of a pulse will be
: formula_12

Rewriting the above equation in terms of Δ&quot;t&quot; allows one to determine the DM by measuring pulse arrival times at multiple frequencies. This in turn can be used to study the interstellar medium, as well as allow observations of pulsars at different frequencies to be combined.

<text>Hannoverscher Sportverein von 1896, commonly referred to as Hannover 96 (), is a German professional football club based in the city of Hanover, Lower Saxony. They played in the Bundesliga for a total of 30 years between 1964 and 2019 and currently play in the 2. Bundesliga, the second tier in the German football league system, having been relegated from the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s first tier, after finishing 17th in the 2018–19 season.

Hannover 96 was founded in 1896. Hannover have won two German championships and one DFB-Pokal. Hannover&#x27;s stadium is the HDI-Arena. Hannover 96 has a long-standing rivalry with Eintracht Braunschweig.

==History==
===Foundation to the Second World War===

The club was founded on 12 April 1896 as Hannoverscher Fußball-Club 1896, upon the suggestion of Ferdinand-Wilhelm Fricke, founder of the Deutscher FV 1878 Hannover. Their initial enthusiasm was for athletics and rugby; football did not become their primary interest until 1899. Most of the membership of Germania 1902 Hannover became part of 96 in 1902, while others of the club formed Hannoverscher Ballspielverein. In 1913, they merged with Ballverein 1898 Hannovera (formed in the 1905 merger of Fußballverein Hannovera, 1898 Hannover, and Hannoverscher BV) to become Hannoverscher Sportverein 1896. Hannoverscher FC&#x27;s colours were black-white-green, but they played in blue, while BV played in red. The newly united team kept black-white-green as the club colours, but they chose to take to the field in red, giving the team the nickname &quot;Die Roten&quot; (&quot;The Reds&quot;). The team&#x27;s third jersey is in the club&#x27;s official colours. The club made regular appearances in the national playoffs through the early 1900s, but was unable to progress past Eintracht Braunschweig, planting the seeds of a rivalry that has survived to this day. HSV continued to field strong sides and make national level appearances on into the 1920s. During Nazi rule, German football was re-organized into 16 top-flight leagues in 1933 and Hannover became part of the Gauliga Niedersachsen. They appeared in the country&#x27;s final rounds in 1935 and sent representatives to the national side the next year. They won their first national championship in 1938, in what was one of the biggest upsets in German football history, when they beat Schalke 04, the most dominant side in the country in the era. The two sides played to a 3–3 draw before Hannover prevailed 4–3 in a tension-filled re-match. In 1942, the team moved to the newly formed Gauliga Braunschweig-Südhannover.

===Post-War era===

In common with most other German organizations, the club was dissolved after the Second World War by occupying Allied authorities. A combined local side was assembled in August 1945 and the next month a mixed group of players from Hannover 96 and Arminia Hannover played their first post-war match against a British military team. HSV was later formally re-established as Hannoverscher SV on 11 November 1945, before re-adopting its traditional name on 27 April 1946. The club resumed league play in 1947 in the first division Oberliga Nord and was relegated, but quickly returned to the top-flight in 1949. Hannover 96&#x27;s next appearance in a national final would not come until 1954 when they soundly defeated 1. FC Kaiserslautern 5–1. The beaten side included five of the same players who would go on later that year to win Germany&#x27;s first World Cup in a surprise victory known as the Miracle of Bern. In 1963, the Bundesliga, Germany&#x27;s new professional football league, began play with 16 of the nation&#x27;s top teams. Hannover played in the Regionalliga Nord (II) that season, but earned promotion to the senior circuit in the following year. The club&#x27;s advance to the Bundesliga in 1964 was well received, as they set a league attendance record in their first year, averaging 46,000 spectators a game. 96 played at the upper level for a decade, until they were relegated to the 2nd Bundesliga Nord for the 1974–75 season. They returned quickly, but again went down, this time to spend 17 of the next 20 years in the second tier.

===Reunification to present===

The club faced financial problems in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s. Then, in 1992, Hannover&#x27;s performance would lead them to earn their first DFB-Pokal and help to secure stable finances. That run included victories over Bundesliga sides Borussia Dortmund, VfL Bochum, Karlsruher SC, Werder Bremen and Borussia Mönchengladbach, as they became the first lower division side to win the competition. The team&#x27;s low point came with demotion to Regionalliga Nord (III) for two years in 1996–98.

Hannover went on to acquire new players, many of whom went on to play for the national team – notably Gerald Asamoah, Sebastian Kehl and Fabian Ernst. 96 returned to tier II play in 1998, and to the Bundesliga in 2002 on the strength of a record-setting 75-point season. Since their promotion, the club have consolidated in the top flight, consistently earning mid-table finishes under several managers. Coach Dieter Hecking was brought in just weeks into the 2006–07 season after a poor start under Peter Neururer, in which the club lost the first three matches by a combined 11 goals. The 2007–08 season showed some early promise, with pre-season wins over Rangers and Real Madrid. However, they earned mixed results in their opening six Bundesliga matches. The team then put together a three match winning run, capped by a 2–0 win at champions VfB Stuttgart, to enter into the top six. Following the winter break, Hannover after some poor performances, which they turned around to be defeated only two times in their last 11 matches of the season. This secured a points record of 49 for &quot;Die Roten&quot; in the Bundesliga, thus ending them in eighth place.

The 2008–09 season started poorly for Hannover with losses. However, performance improved with a 5–1 victory of Borussia Mönchengladbach, a 1–0 win over Bayern Munich at home, which had not occurred for 20 years, and a 3–0 victory over Hamburger SV. Hannover settled in the lower-mid-table until the winter break. The second half of the season consisted of inconsistent results, relying almost entirely on home form to keep the club in the Bundesliga. The club finally achieved an away win with a few games remaining which stabilized them, leading to an 11th-place finish. 

The 2009–10 season was launched, with a new kit being released which included traditional away and alternative kits. Hannover also signed a new technical director in Jörg Schmadtke. New signings were Karim Haggui and Constant Djakpa from Bayer Leverkusen, Valdet Rama from FC Ingolstadt. The season started with a late 1–0 loss to Hertha BSC and a home draw to Mainz 05, after which coach Dieter Hecking resigned voluntarily. He was succeeded by former assistant Andreas Bergmann. As the season continued, Hannover again had many key players injured, including the majority of attacking players and key defenders, alongside the suicide of Robert Enke, Hannover&#x27;s German international goalkeeper. Andreas Bergmann was removed as coach and replaced by Mirko Slomka shortly after the winter break. Arouna Koné and Elson were signed to boost the squad. Hannover 96 spent the majority of the year in the relegation zone, and with a few wins in the last games of the season, Hannover had to win, and have results elsewhere be favorable to them. Hannover won 3–0, with Arnold Bruggink, Mike Hanke and Sérgio Pinto all scoring to keep them in the Bundesliga.

In the 2010–11 season, Hannover finished in fourth place, qualifying for Europe for the first time in 19 years. In 2011–12, the team opened with a 2–1 win over 1899 Hoffenheim, followed by a 2–1 away win against 1. FC Nürnberg. In the play-offs to the Europa League, Hannover won against Sevilla 3–2 on aggregate to reach the group stage. Shortly before the end of the 2011–12 season, Hannover Technical Director Jörg Schmadtke resigned due to family issues.

Hannover finished bottom of the Bundesliga in the 2015–16 season and were relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. The club chose to keep the majority of their first-team squad together. However, after early in the 2016–17 season, poor performances prompted the club&#x27;s board to sack manager Daniel Stendel, and appoint Andre Breitenreiter as their new manager. He led the team to seven wins in the final 11 games, helping the club secure second place behind VfB Stuttgart and return to the top flight.

Adverse publicity resulted for the club when a large contingent of ultras travelled to England for a 2017–18 pre-season game against Burnley. Supporters caused trouble in the town centre prior to the game. Once inside Turf Moor, they responded to a brief altercation on the pitch after 40 minutes by charging the home fans, tearing out seats and using them as missiles. On police advice the game was abandoned at half-time, with Hannover 96 trailing 1–0.

==Death of Robert Enke==

On 10 November 2009, at the age of 32, Hannover&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper Robert Enke died as a result of suicide after he stood in front of a regional express train at a level crossing in Eilvese, Neustadt am Rübenberge. Police confirmed a suicide note had been found, but did not publicise its details. His widow, Teresa, revealed that her husband had been suffering from depression for six years and was treated by a psychiatrist. After the death of his daughter Lara in 2006, he struggled to cope with the loss.

Upon news breaking of what had happened, many fans immediately gathered at Hannover 96&#x27;s AWD-Arena home, where they laid flowers, lit candles and signed a book of condolence. His former club Barcelona held a minute&#x27;s silence before their game that night, and several international matches the following weekend paid the same tribute. As a mark of respect, the German national team cancelled their friendly match against Chile, which had been scheduled for 14 November. A minute&#x27;s silence was also held at all Bundesliga games on 21 and 22 November 2009, as well as at Benfica&#x27;s game in the Taça de Portugal - Benfica was another former club of Enke&#x27;s. Germany also cancelled a planned training session and all interviews after his death. Oliver Bierhoff, the national team&#x27;s general manager, said, &quot;We are all shocked. We are lost for words.&quot;

On 15 November 2009, nearly 40,000 attendees filled the AWD-Arena for his memorial service. Enke&#x27;s coffin, covered in white roses, was carried by six of his Hannover 96 teammates. He was then buried in Neustadt, outside the city of Hanover, next to his daughter&#x27;s grave. As a further mark of respect for their former teammate, Hannover 96 players displayed the number one in a circle on the breast of their jerseys, as approved by the German Football Association (DFL), as a subtle tribute for the rest of the 2009–10 season.

==Stadium==
Hannover 96 plays in the Heinz-von-Heiden-Arena, built in 1954 as the &quot;Niedersachsenstadion&quot;, which 2025 has a capacity of 49,000 spectators. Before the year 2013, the arena was called &quot;AWD-Arena&quot;. But after changing the sponsor the stadium name was changed to &quot;HDI-Arena&quot;. During the 2006 World Cup, the stadium was the site of four first round matches and one Round of 16 match. The stadium had also served as a site for matches in the 1974 World Cup and UEFA Euro 1988.

<text>In materials science, dispersion is the fraction of atoms of a material exposed to the surface. In general, &quot;D&quot; = &quot;N&quot;S/&quot;N&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is the dispersion, &quot;N&quot;S is the number of surface atoms and &quot;N&quot;T is the total number of atoms of the material. It is an important concept in heterogeneous catalysis, since only atoms exposed to the surface can affect catalytic surface reactions. Dispersion increases with decreasing crystallite size and approaches unity at a crystallite diameter of about 0.1 nm.

<doc id="172336" wikidata="Q179628" url="?curid=172336" title="Mohair">
<text>Mohair (pronounced ) originated from the Arabic word [مهير] and it is a fabric or yarn made from the hair of the Angora goat (not Angora wool from the fur of the Angora rabbit). Both durable and resilient, mohair is lustrous with high sheen, and is often blended to add these qualities to a textile. Mohair takes dye exceptionally well. It feels warm in winter due to excellent insulating properties, while moisture-wicking keeps it cool in summer. It is durable, naturally elastic, flame-resistant and crease-resistant. It is considered a luxury fiber, like cashmere, alpaca, angora, and silk, and is more expensive than most sheep&#x27;s wool.

Mohair is composed mostly of keratin, a protein in the hair, wool, horns and skin of all mammals, but mohair&#x27;s special properties are unique to the Angora goat. While it has scales like wool, they are not fully developed, thus, mohair feels different from common or standard wool.

Mohair fiber is approximately 25–45 micrometres in diameter.
It expands in diameter with the age of the goat, growing along with the animal. Finer, softer hair from younger animals is used (for example) in scarves and shawls; the thicker, coarser hair from older animals is more often used for carpets and in heavy fabrics intended for outerwear.

The term &quot;mohair&quot; is sometimes used to describe the material in the folding roof on convertible cars. In this case &quot;mohair&quot; refers to a denim-like canvas.

==Production==
Shearing is done twice a year, in the spring and in the fall. One goat will produce of mohair a year. Shearing is done on a cleanly-swept floor and extra care is taken to keep the hair clean and free of debris. The hair is then processed to remove natural grease, dirt and vegetable matter. Mohair grows in uniform locks. The Angora goat is a single-coat breed, and unlike pygora or cashmere, there is no need to dehair a mohair fleece to separate the coarse hair from the down hair.

South Africa is the world&#x27;s largest mohair producer as of 2013, supplying around 50% of the total world production. , yet as of 2024 some people believe that majority production has moved to Lesotho. However, the latter statement is controversial and requires proper scrutiny. Due to animal cruelty in the South African farms, Zara, H&amp;M, Gap, Topshop, Lacoste, and many more will no longer sell mohair clothing.

==History==
Mohair is one of the oldest textile fibers in use, produced exclusively in Turkey. Fabric made of mohair was known in England by the early 18th century.
The word &quot;mohair&quot; was adopted into English sometime before 1570 from the Arabic: &quot;mukhayyar&quot;, a type of haircloth, literally &quot;choice&quot;, from &quot;khayyara&quot;, &quot;he chose&quot;.

In about 1820, raw mohair was first exported from Turkey to England, which then became the leading manufacturer of mohair products. The Yorkshire mills spun yarn that was exported to Russia, Germany, Austria, etc., as well as woven directly in Yorkshire.

Until 1849, the Turkish province of Ankara was the sole producer of Angora goats. Charles V is believed to be the first to bring Angora goats to Europe. Due to the great demand for mohair fiber, throughout the 1800s there was a great deal of crossbreeding between Angora goats and common goats. The growing demand for mohair further resulted in attempts on a commercial scale to introduce the goat into South Africa (where it was crossed with the native goat) in 1838, the United States in 1849, Australia from 1856 to 1875, and later still New Zealand. In 1849, Angora goats made their way to America as a gift from Turkey.

During the 1960s, a blend of mohair and wool suiting fabric known as Tonik or Tonic was developed in England. This had a shiny, color-changing appearance and was popular among rude boys and the mod subculture. Similar suits were worn by mod revivalists, skinheads, and fans of ska punk and two tone music during the early to mid-1980s.

Today South Africa is the largest mohair producer in the world, with the majority of South African mohair being produced in the Eastern Cape. The United States is the second-largest producer, with the majority of American mohair being produced in Texas. Turkey also produces good-quality mohair. Because the goats are sheared once a year (different from South Africa), Turkey produces the longest mohair of the world.

In December 2006 the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of mohair and other natural fibers.

==Uses==
Mohair is used in scarves, winter hats, suits, sweaters, coats, socks and home furnishing. Mohair fiber is also found in carpets, wall fabrics, craft yarns, and many other fabrics, and may be used as a substitute for fur. Because its texture resembles fine human hair, mohair is often used in making high-grade doll wigs or in rooting customized dolls.

Mohair is a very soft yarn when compared with other natural and synthetic fibers. Due to mohair&#x27;s lacking prominent, protruding scales along the hair&#x27;s surface, it is often blended with wool or alpaca. Blending the heavily scaled wool helps the smooth mohair fibers hold their shape and stick together when spun into yarn. Mohair is also valued for certain other unique characteristics: it is warmer than other fibers, even when used to make a light-weight garment, and is often blended with wool for this reason; and mohair fibers have a distinctive luster created by the way they reflect light. Combined with mohair&#x27;s ability to absorb dyes exceptionally well, pure mohair yarns are usually recognizable for their vivid, saturated colours.

Fibers from young goats are softest and are used to manufacture yarn for clothing. Fibers from mature goats are used to produce such things as rugs and carpets. Mohair is also used in &#x27;climbing skins&#x27; for randonnée skiing and ski touring. The mohair is used in a carpet allowing the skier an appropriate ascension method without sliding downhill.

==Mohair industry worldwide==
As of 2009, world output of mohair was estimated at around 5,000 tonnes a year, down from a high of 25,000 tonnes in the 1990s. South Africa accounts for 60% of total production. South African mohair is generally exported raw or semi-processed to textile makers in Europe, the UK and the Far East. Prices for adult mohair declined in 2010 while prices for kid mohair remained the same. An emerging market for mohair producers has been China.

==US subsidies for mohair production==

During World War II US soldiers wore uniforms made of wool. Worried that domestic producers could not supply enough for future wars, Congress enacted loan and price support programs for wool and mohair in the National Wool Act of 1954 as part of the 1954 Farm Bill. Despite these subsidies, wool and mohair production declined. The strategic importance declined as well; the US military adopted uniforms made of synthetic fibers, such as dacron, and officially removed wool from the list of strategic materials in 1960. Nevertheless, the U.S. government continued to provide subsidies to mohair producers until 1995, when the subsidies were &quot;eliminated effective with the marketing year ending December 31, 1995&quot;. In &quot;The Future of Freedom: Illiberal Democracy at Home and Abroad&quot;, Fareed Zakaria points out that the subsidies were reinstated a few years later, due in large part to the lobbying on behalf of the special interests of the subsidy recipients. By 2000, Congress had appropriated US$20 million for goat and sheep producers. As of 2002, mohair producers were still able to receive special assistance loans from the U.S. government, after an amendment to eliminate the subsidy was defeated. The U.S. currently subsidizes mohair production under the Marketing Assistance Loan Program of the 2014 Farm Act.

== In popular culture ==
In the Elton John song &quot;Bennie and the Jets,&quot; Bennie is said to wear a suit made of mohair.

In the Song &quot;The Boy from New York City,&quot; first recorded by The Ad Libs, and made popular by The Manhattan Transfer, the lines &quot;And he&#x27;s cute In his mohair suit&quot; appear.

In the Tom Waits song &quot;Jockey Full of Bourbon&quot;, the jockey claims to have, &quot;two pair of pants and a mohair vest.&quot;

In the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode &quot;The Sniffing Accountant&quot;, Jerry&#x27;s mohair sweater figures prominently into the plot.

<text>Sienna Tiggy Guillory (; born 16 March 1975) is an English actress and former model. She portrayed Jill Valentine in several entries of the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; action-horror film series. Other prominent roles include elf princess Arya Dröttningu in the fantasy-adventure film &quot;Eragon&quot;, and the title role in the TV miniseries &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;. She has appeared in TV shows including &quot;Fortitude&quot;, &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Lucky Man&quot;, and &quot;Luther&quot;.

== Early life ==

Born in Kettering, Northamptonshire, Guillory is the daughter of American folk guitarist Isaac Guillory and his first wife, English model Tina Thompson, who married in 1973. Her father was the son of American and Turkish-Jewish parents and born at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba.

Her parents moved to Fulham, London, when Guillory was two, then later to Norfolk when she was 11. At the age of ten, she went to stay with cousins in Mexico to learn Spanish.

She has a half-brother named Jace, who has the same mother. Her father adopted him. Her parents divorced in 1990 when Sienna was 14. In 1993, her father married Vickie McMillan, and had two children with her, Ellie and Jacob.

Guillory attended Gresham&#x27;s School in Holt, Norfolk, where she took part in numerous school productions. She started horseback riding at the age of two. At 14, she was given a horse, which she named The Night Porter, or &quot;Porty&quot;, after the film &quot;The Night Porter&quot;; Guillory was a fan of its leading actress Charlotte Rampling.

In December 2000, Guillory&#x27;s father died of cancer at the age of 53.

== Career ==

=== Modelling ===
In 1997, Guillory accompanied a ballerina friend to the London modelling agency Select Model Management and was soon signed. She modelled to support her acting career. As a model, she worked in campaigns for Armani, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Burberry and Paul Smith and appeared on the covers of several fashion magazines. In 1999, she became the face of the Hugo Boss fragrance campaign, succeeding model Karen Ferrari and continuing the campaign for three years. After modelling for a few years, Guillory returned her focus to acting in 2000. She is signed to Independent Models in London.

=== Acting ===
Guillory explained that she &quot;became an actor because I wanted to know what it was like to be other people. Because possibly I don&#x27;t like myself&quot;, and later said &quot;I hate acting, really hate it. I kind of fell into it sideways ... I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we&#x27;d always lived on Family Support&quot;. She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren on stage she was inspired again.

In 1993, Guillory made her screen debut in &quot;Riders&quot;, a TV adaptation of Jilly Cooper&#x27;s novel of the same name, for which the casting directors needed a young actress who was able to ride a horse. Her performance landed her another small role in the miniseries &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;, opposite Mira Sorvino.

Before becoming a model to support her acting career, Guillory waited tables at a club. In an interview in 2000, she said about the experience &quot;Supporting my acting habit with waitressing was probably the most useful thing I&#x27;ve done.&quot; During her time as a model, she studied acting at the New World School of the Arts and the Paris Conservatoire, also taking small television and film roles in &quot;The Future Lasts a Long Time&quot; (1996), &quot;The Rules of Engagement&quot; (1999), &quot;Star! Star!&quot; (1999), &quot;Kiss Kiss (Bang Bang)&quot; (2000), &quot;The 3 Kings&quot; (2000), and &quot;Two Days, Nine Lives&quot; (2000). During this time, Guillory decided to go on with her acting career because &quot;I was so scared of going to university and being with people my own age again, having been with that tiny little sect of girls in Norfolk whose daddies were farmers and politicians, who didn&#x27;t trust me and didn&#x27;t know where I was coming from&quot;.

She returned to film with a more substantial role in the thriller &quot;Sorted&quot; (2000). Guillory went on to appear in the BBC production &quot;Take a Girl Like You&quot;, a television adaptation of Kingsley Amis&#x27;s novel of the same name. She portrayed Jenny Bunn, the story&#x27;s virginal heroine, and gained critical attention for her part in the period piece. Guillory was pleased to have played a more innocent character, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve played floozies, psychopaths, assassins, crackheads... It&#x27;s nice to do something with a lighter touch.&quot; The production did not fare well in the ratings.

In 2001, Guillory continued with other roles in predominantly British films, including &quot;Oblivious&quot;, &quot;Late Night Shopping&quot; (with husband Enzo Cilenti), &quot;The Last Minute&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. 2002 saw Guillory appear in &quot;The Time Machine&quot;, alongside Guy Pearce and Jeremy Irons. She was pleased to take on a larger scale film, after having worked on low-budget independent films, and compared the experience with &quot;finding an unicorn in your sock drawer&quot;. She played Emma, the fiancée of Pearce&#x27;s character, who was killed early in the film and whose death set off its main events.

In 2003, after a friend had received a script for &quot;The Principles of Lust&quot;, Guillory claims she &quot;read it and couldn&#x27;t put it down, and begged to read for the part&quot;. She was impressed by director Penny Woolcock&#x27;s unconventional style of shooting, without rehearsing the actors, using raw takes and improvisational performances. For the role of Juliette, Guillory performed nude in the film&#x27;s sex scenes which were filmed during the first week of filming, making her somewhat nervous. She later went on to say that it was one of her favorite acting experiences. Afterwards, Guillory had a small role in the romantic comedy &quot;Love Actually&quot; before taking the starring role in the television miniseries &quot;Helen of Troy&quot;. The series was mostly based on Homer&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Iliad&quot; and focuses on the mythological life of Helen. &quot;Helen of Troy&quot; was nominated for best miniseries at the Satellite Awards.

In May 2004, Guillory starred in a new stage production of &quot;The Shape of Things&quot; at the New Ambassadors Theatre in London, with husband Cilenti. That year she also played her first big Hollywood role. She was cast as Jill Valentine, one of the lead characters in the video game adaptation sequel &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;. The film makers had searched widely for an actress to portray the video game character and found her in Guillory, who had to &quot;please not only the movie-going audience but also the gamers.&quot; She was &quot;a dead ringer for Jill Valentine&quot;. Guillory studied the original character&#x27;s movements by watching playthroughs of the video game &quot;Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&quot;. Before getting the script for the film, she had not been familiar with the video games or seen &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002).

She said about her role:

After the success of &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse&quot;, Guillory appeared in other film and television roles, including &quot;Beauty&quot; (2004), &quot;&quot; (2005), &quot;In the Bathroom&quot; (2005), &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot; (2005), &quot;Silence Becomes You&quot; (2005), and &quot;Rabbit Fever&quot; (2006).

In 2006, Guillory was a lead in the ensemble cast of the fantasy &quot;Eragon,&quot; the film adaptation of the novel by Christopher Paolini; the role reunited her with &quot;The Time Machine&quot; co-star Jeremy Irons. She portrayed Arya Dröttningu, an elf princess. She had not read the novels before filming, but after accepting the role she became a fan of Paolini&#x27;s work. Although Arya is a key character in the film, Guillory had little screen time and went on to say jokingly: &quot;I&#x27;ve been trying to explain to friends who&#x27;ve seen the trailer [...] I&#x27;m like, &quot;[...] but that&#x27;s my whole part!&quot;&quot; &quot;Eragon&quot; was not well received by the critics, but was nominated as Best Fantasy Film at the 2006 Saturn Awards. The film grossed approximately $75 million in the US and $173.9 million elsewhere, totaling $249 million worldwide. Guillory was invited to reprise her role as Jill Valentine in &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Resident Evil: Apocalypse,&quot; but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Eragon&quot;.

In 2007, she starred in the Spanish production &quot;The Heart of the Earth&quot;, and later in the year finished filming the horror/thriller &quot;Victims&quot; and the fantasy novel adaptation &quot;Inkheart&quot;. In &quot;Inkheart&quot;, she plays Resa, the wife of Brendan Fraser&#x27;s character and the mother of Eliza Bennett&#x27;s. Guillory acted alongside Helen Mirren, a friend of the Guillory family who was a role model when she first had aspirations towards acting.

Guillory was to be a lead in the television series &quot;The Oaks&quot;, expected to begin airing in 2008. She joined Bahar Soomekh, Matt Lanter, Romy Rosemont, Jeremy Renner, Michael Rispoli and Shannon Lucio in the series, which follows the intertwining stories of three families—a young couple in 1968 who have lost a child, a family of four in 1998, and a pregnant couple in 2008—who are haunted by the same spirit in their house. The television series began filming on 5 November 2007 on location in Pasadena, California. Guillory will play Jessica, the 2008 couple&#x27;s neighbour, a woman who has Asperger syndrome who went to school with the husband (and father-to-be) and shares a secret with him.

In May 2010, &quot;Shock Till You Drop.com&quot; confirmed the return of Jill Valentine in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; film franchise&#x27;s fourth installment, &quot;Resident Evil: Afterlife&quot;, with Guillory reprising the role. On 31 May, Jovovich also confirmed that Guillory would return as Jill. Guillory reappears in the film in a mid-end credit scene. She returned to a starring role in the following film, &quot;Resident Evil: Retribution&quot;, as the main antagonist of the film.

In 2015, she joined the main cast as scientist Natalie Yelburton in the new thriller series &quot;Fortitude&quot;, commissioned by Sky Atlantic and set in the fictional Arctic oil settlement of the same name. She returned to the role for the show&#x27;s second series in 2016, and appeared in the third season in 2018.

In January 2016 she also joined the cast of Sky One&#x27;s new series, &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Lucky Man&quot;, playing the character Eve. She subsequently returned for both the second and third seasons.

In May 2018, she appeared as the only actor, yet playing multiple roles, in the music video for Liam Gallagher&#x27;s &quot;Paper Crown&quot;. In 2023, she starred as the lead villain and billionaire Hillary Driscoll in the film &quot;Meg 2: The Trench&quot;.

== Media ==

In 2001, readers of &quot;Esquire&quot; UK voted Guillory &quot;Britain&#x27;s Most Eligible Woman&quot; and featured her in a pictorial in the magazine. Guillory was photographed for the cover and shoot by photographer Jonathan Glynn Smith. In 2002, she was number 89 on &quot;Maxim&quot;″s &quot;Hot 100 List&quot; of the &quot;world&#x27;s 100 most beautiful women&quot;, and in 2007 Guillory was voted number 54 at Askmen.com&#x27;s Top 99 Countdown.

Guillory has been quoted as disliking the Hollywood culture, saying she does not wish to be part of it: 

== Personal life ==
Guillory married actor Nick Moran in July 1997; they divorced in 2000. In 2000, Guillory began dating English actor Enzo Cilenti, and they married in 2002. The couple appeared in the 2001 film &quot;Late Night Shopping&quot;, and have continued to appear together in various works. In August 2004, Guillory and Cilenti cycled five stages of the Tour de France to raise money for charity. On 1 February 2011, Guillory gave birth to twin daughters, Valentina and Lucia Cilenti, named after her grandmother and great aunt who were also twin sisters.

<text>The Dassault Mirage III () is a family of single/dual-seat, single-engine, fighter aircraft developed and manufactured by French aircraft company Dassault Aviation. It was the first Western European combat aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in horizontal flight, which it achieved on 24 October 1958.

In 1952, the French government issued its specification, calling for a lightweight, all-weather interceptor. Amongst the respondents were Dassault with their design, initially known as the Mirage I. Following favourable flight testing held over the course of 1954, in which speeds of up to Mach 1.6 were attained, it was decided that a larger follow-on aircraft would be required to bear the necessary equipment and payloads. An enlarged Mirage II proposal was considered, as well as MD 610 Cavalier (3 versions), but was discarded in favour of a further-developed design, powered by the newly developed Snecma Atar afterburning turbojet engine, designated as the Mirage III. In October 1960, the first major production model, designated as the Mirage IIIC, performed its maiden flight. Initial operational deliveries of this model commenced in July 1961; a total of 95 Mirage IIICs were obtained by the French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, AdA). The Mirage IIIC was rapidly followed by numerous other variants.

The Mirage III was produced in large numbers for both the French Air Force and a wide number of export customers. Prominent overseas operators of the fighter included Argentina, Australia, South Africa, Pakistan and Israel, as well as a number of non-aligned nations. Often considered to be a second-generation fighter aircraft, the Mirage III experienced a lengthy service life with several of these operators; for some time, the type remained a fairly maneuverable aircraft and an effective opponent when engaged in close-range dogfighting. During its service with the French Air Force, the Mirage III was normally armed with assorted air-to-ground ordnance or R.550 Magic air-to-air missiles. Its design proved to be relatively versatile, allowing the fighter model to be readily adapted to serve in a variety of roles, including trainer, reconnaissance and ground-attack versions, along with several more extensive derivatives of the aircraft, including the Dassault Mirage 5, Dassault Mirage IIIV and Atlas Cheetah. Some operators have undertaken extensive modification and upgrade programmes, such as Project ROSE of the Pakistan Air Force.

The Mirage III has been used in active combat roles in multiple conflicts by a number of operators. The Israeli Air Force was perhaps the most prolific operator of the fighter outside of France itself; Israel deployed their Mirage IIIs in both the Six-Day War, where it was used as both an air superiority and strike aircraft, and the Yom Kippur War, during which it was used exclusively in air-to-air combat in conjunction with the IAI Nesher, an Israeli-built derivative of the Mirage 5. Ace of aces Giora Epstein achieved all of his kills flying either the Mirage III or the Nesher. During the South African Border War, the Mirage III formed the bulk of the South African Air Force&#x27;s fleet, comprising a cluster of Mirage IIICZ interceptors, Mirage IIIEZ fighter-bombers and Mirage IIIRZ reconnaissance fighters; following the introduction of the newer Mirage F1, the type was dedicated to secondary roles in the conflict, such as daytime interception, base security, reconnaissance and training. The Argentine Air Force used the Mirage IIIEA during the Falklands War, but their lack of an aerial refueling capability limited the aircraft&#x27;s usefulness in the conflict. Even using drop tanks, the Mirages only had an endurance of five minutes within the combat area around the British fleet.

==Development==

===Origins===
The Mirage III family has its origins within a series of studies conducted by the French Defence Ministry which had commenced in 1952. At the time, several nations had taken an interest in the prospects of a light fighter, which had been motivated by combat experiences acquired during the Korean War, specifically the Soviet-built Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 jet-propelled fighter aircraft which had drawn considerable attention internationally. Western nations were keen to explore the performance of a relatively uncomplicated and heavily armed jet-powered swept wing fighter, inspired by the rapid advances in aircraft capabilities that had been made by the Soviet Union. France was one of the quickest governments of several nations, including the United Kingdom (resulting in the Folland Gnat), the United States (leading to the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk), and Italy (which became the Fiat G.91), to embark on encouraging the development of such an aircraft.

In 1952, the French government issued its specification, calling for a lightweight, all-weather interceptor, capable of climbing to in 6 minutes along with the ability to reach Mach 1.3 in level flight. Three separate French manufacturers decided to respond to the specification, these being Dassault Aviation, Sud-Est, and Sud-Ouest, offering the &quot;MD.550 Mystère Delta&quot;, SE.212 Durandal and SO.9000 Trident, respectively. Dassault&#x27;s submission, which became known as the MD.550 Mystère Delta, was a diminutive and sleek-appearing aircraft that was principally powered by a pair of Armstrong Siddeley MD30R Viper afterburning turbojet engines (built under licence by Dassault); atypically, the design also featured provisions for the installation of a secondary propulsion system in the form of a SEPR-built 66 liquid-fuel rocket engine, capable of providing boost thrust of .

The basic layout of the MD.550 Mystère Delta featured a tailless delta configuration, possessing a 5 per cent thickness (ratio of airfoil thickness to length) and 60° sweep, complete with a large vertical stabilizer and rudder. However, the tailless delta configuration imposed a number of limitations, including the lack of a horizontal stabilizer, which meant that conventional flaps could not be used; this resulted in a relatively long takeoff run and a high landing speed. The delta wing itself limits maneuverability and suffers from buffeting at low altitude due to the large wing area and resulting low wing loading. However, the delta is a simple design, easy to construct and relatively robust while providing generous amounts of internal volume in the wing for fuel tankage and being capable of achieving high speeds when flown in a straight line.
British aviation author Derek Wood observed that there was &quot;a striking resemblance&quot; between the MD.550 Delta and the British Fairey Delta 2, an experimental aircraft that first flew on 6 October 1954, and which set a new world speed record on 1 March 1956. During the latter stages of testing of the Fairy Delta 2 in October and November 1956, the FD2 performed 47 low level supersonic test flights from Cazaux Air Base, Bordeaux, in France. Dassault engineers observed these trials and obtained additional data on the performance and flight characteristics of delta wing aircraft. The Delta 2 confirmed Dassault&#x27;s theories, and provided additional supporting evidence for the viability of the Mirage III development.

===Flight testing===
On 25 June 1955, the first prototype of the MD.550 Mystère Delta, without afterburning engines or rocket motor and with an unusually large vertical stabilizer, conducted its maiden flight. In this configuration, it was able to attain a maximum speed of Mach 1.15. Following initial flights, it received a redesign that involved the vertical stabilizer being reduced in size along with the installation of afterburners and a rocket motor; it was at this point that the aircraft was renamed as the &quot;Mirage I&quot;. In late 1954, the prototype attained a recorded speed of Mach 1.3 in level flight without rocket assistance, as well as reaching Mach 1.6 when using the rocket motor. According to aviation author John F. Brindley, testing of the Mirage I and prototypes of the rival Trident and Durandal designs had demonstrated the limitations of the light fighter concept, namely limitations on both endurance and equipment/payload capacity. The small size of the Mirage I restricted its armament to a single air-to-air missile, and it was decided during flight trials that the aircraft was too small for the carriage of a useful armament. Following the completion of flying trials, the Mirage I prototype was eventually scrapped.

Dassault was keen to produce a successor to the Mirage I prototype; at one point, the firm was considering the production of an enlarged version, known as the &quot;Mirage II&quot;, which would have been furnished with a pair of Turbomeca Gabizo turbojet engines. However, the Mirage II ultimately remained unbuilt as it was bypassed for an even more ambitious design, being 30 per cent heavier than the original Mirage I, powered by the newly developed Snecma Atar afterburning turbojet engine, capable of generating up to of thrust. The Atar was an axial-flow turbojet design, having been derived from the German Second World War-era BMW 003 engine. The new Atar-equipped fighter design received the name &quot;Mirage III&quot;. There was also an even larger &quot;heavy fighter&quot; design drafted, referred to as the Mirage IV. A decisive factor had been interest from the French military, who had made its favour for the Mirage III proposal known to the company.

The Mirage III incorporated various new design principles, such as the transonic area rule concept, where changes to an aircraft&#x27;s cross-section were made as gradual as possible, resulting in the famous &quot;wasp waist&quot; configuration of many supersonic fighters. Similar to its Mirage I predecessor, the Mirage III had provision for a booster rocket engine. On 17 November 1956, the prototype Mirage III perform its first flight. During its 10th flight, it was recorded as having attained a speed of Mach 1.52 at one point. During the course of the flight test programme, the prototype was fitted with a pair of manually-operated intake half-cone shock diffusers, known as &quot;souris&quot; (&quot;mice&quot;), which could be moved forward as the Mach number increased. This achieved a reduction in inlet pressure losses by ensuring the fuselage oblique shock remained outside the intake lip. Reportedly, their addition enabled an increased speed of Mach 1.65 to be reached, while use of the supplemental SEPR 66 rocket (as fitted to the Mirage I) had allowed for a speed of Mach 1.8 to be reached in September 1957.

The success of the Mirage III prototype resulted in an order for 10 pre-production &quot;Mirage IIIA&quot; fighters. Although the type had initially conceived of as an interceptor, the batch had been ordered with the intention of using them to develop the type for additional roles as well. The Mirage IIIA were almost 2 meters longer than the Mirage III prototype, had an enlarged wing of 17.3 per cent greater area, a chord reduced to 4.5 per cent, and an Atar 09B turbojet capable of generating afterburning thrust of up to . The SEPR 841 rocket engine was also retained. The Mirage IIIA was also fitted with a Thomson-CSF-built Cyrano Ibis air intercept radar, operational-standard avionics, and a drag chute to shorten its landing roll.

In May 1958, the first Mirage IIIA conducted its first flight. On 24 October of that year, this aircraft achieved a top speed of Mach 2.2 during one of its test flights, thus becoming the first Western European aircraft to exceed Mach 2 in level flight. In December 1959, the tenth and final Mirage IIIA was rolled out; the last six pre-production aircraft were largely representative of the subsequent initial production standard. The test regime involved a wide variety of tasks, including the evaluation of the newer SEPR 841 rocket motor, various underwing drop tanks, and other major systems. One Mirage IIIA was powered by a Rolls-Royce Avon 67 engine capable of generating of thrust, to serve as a test model for Australian evaluation, which was given the &quot;Mirage IIIO&quot; designation. This variant flew in February 1961, but the Avon powerplant was ultimately not adopted on production aircraft.

===Mirage IIIC and Mirage IIIB===

The first major production model, the &quot;Mirage IIIC&quot;, first flew in October 1960. The IIIC was largely similar to the earlier IIIA, being less than a half meter longer and featuring a full operational fit. The Mirage IIIC was a single-seat interceptor, with an Atar 09B turbojet engine, featuring an eyelid type variable exhaust. The Mirage IIIC was armed with twin 30 mm DEFA cannon fitted in the belly with the gun ports under the air intakes. Early production Mirage IIICs had three stores pylons, one under the fuselage and one under each wing; another outboard pylon was soon added to each wing, for a total of five, excluding a sleek supersonic tank which also had bomb-carrying capacity. The outboard pylon was intended to carry an AIM-9B Sidewinder air-to-air missile, later replaced by the Matra R550 Magic and was also armed with the radar guided Matra R530 Missile on the center line pylon.

A total of 95 Mirage IIICs were obtained by the French Air Force (&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, AdA), with initial operational deliveries in July 1961. The Mirage IIIC remained in service with the AdA until 1988.

The &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; also placed an order for a two-seat &quot;Mirage IIIB&quot; operational trainer. Performing its first flight on 21 October 1959, it was developed in parallel with the Mirage IIIC. The fuselage was stretched about a meter (3 ft 3.5 in), while both cannons were removed to accommodate the second seat. The IIIB lacked radar and provision for the SEPR rocket was also deleted, although it could carry external stores if desired. The AdA ordered 63 Mirage IIIBs (including the prototype), including five &quot;Mirage IIIB-1&quot; trials aircraft, ten &quot;Mirage IIIB-2(RV)&quot; inflight refueling trainers with dummy nose probes, used for training Mirage IVA bomber pilots, and 20 &quot;Mirage IIIBE&quot;s, with the engine and some other features of the multi-role Mirage IIIE. One Mirage IIIB was fitted with a fly-by-wire flight control system in the mid-1970s and redesignated &quot;Mirage IIIB-SV&quot; (&quot;Stabilité Variable&quot;), it was used as a testbed for the system in the later Mirage 2000.

===Mirage IIIE===
While the initial Mirage IIIC model was heading towards quantity production, Dassault turned its attention towards the development of a multirole/strike variant of the aircraft. Efforts in this direction would eventually materialized in the form of the single-seat &quot;Mirage IIIE&quot;; a two-seat trainer variant of the aircraft was also developed, designated as the &quot;Mirage IIID&quot;. On 5 April 1961, the first of a batch of three prototypes performed its first flight.
The Mirage IIIE considerably differed from the earlier Mirage IIIC interceptor. In terms of its airframe, the aircraft possessed a forward fuselage extension, which had been made to increase the size of the avionics bay, located directly behind the cockpit. The stretch had also enabled its fuel capacity to be expanded, which had been deemed necessary after several pilots had criticized the Mirage IIIC for having been quite limited in terms of its range.

Many Mirage IIIEs were fitted with a British-built Marconi continuous-wave Doppler navigation radar radome on the bottom of the fuselage, underneath the cockpit; in contrast, none of the Mirage IIICs were provided with this apparatus. A similar inconsistent variation was the presence or absence of a high frequency (HF) antenna fitted as a forward extension to the vertical tailplane; on some Mirages, the leading edge of the tailplane was a straight line, while on those with the HF antenna the leading edge had a sloping extension forward. The extension appears to have been generally standard on production Mirage IIIAs and Mirage IIICs, but only appeared in some of the Mirage IIIE&#x27;s export versions. The Mirage IIIE featured Thomson-CSF Cyrano II dual mode air / ground radar; a radar warning receiver (RWR) system with the antennas mounted in the vertical tailplane; and an Atar 09C engine, the latter being equipped with a petal-style variable exhaust.

On 14 January 1964, the first production Mirage IIIE was delivered to the AdA, over time, 192 aircraft were eventually delivered to that service. By 1971, this variant had become the most widely exported version of the aircraft.

===Mirage IIIR===
A number of dedicated reconnaissance variants of the Mirage III were developed and produced, grouped under the general designation of &quot;Mirage IIIR&quot;. These aircraft possessed a Mirage IIIE airframe but were furnished with avionics from the Mirage IIIC variant, along with a purpose-developed camera nose, which internally accommodated up to five OMERA cameras. On this variant, the radar system was removed due to a lack of available space in the nose, however, the aircraft retained the twin DEFA cannons and all compatibility with its external stores. An improved variant, designated as the &quot;Mirage IIIRD&quot;, was also developed later on; it was essentially a Mirage IIIR outfitted with an extra panoramic camera at the most forward nose position, along with the adoption of the Doppler radar and other avionics from the Mirage IIIE, and provision for carrying an infrared linescan or a Side looking airborne radar in an under-fuselage pod.

In response to interest expressed by the AdA in a reconnaissance model of the Mirage design, Dassault proceeded with the development of a pair of prototypes. On 31 October 1961, the first of these prototypes conducted its maiden flight; on 1 February 1963, it was followed by the first production-standard aircraft of the model. The AdA opted to obtain a total of 50 production Mirage IIIRs; the service later ordered a further 20 Mirage IIIRDs as well. Several export customers, most notably Switzerland, also chose to procure reconnaissance Mirages. The Mirage IIIR preceded the Mirage IIIE in operational introduction.

==Exports and license production==

===Exports===
The largest export customers for Mirage IIICs built in France were Israel, their principal variant being the &quot;Mirage IIICJ&quot;, and South Africa, the bulk of their fleet being the &quot;Mirage IIICZ&quot;. Some export customers obtained the Mirage IIIB, with designations only changed to provide a country code, such as: &quot;Mirage IIIDA&quot; for Argentina, &quot;Mirage IIIDBR&quot; for Brazil, &quot;Mirage IIIBJ&quot; for Israel, &quot;Mirage IIIBL&quot; for Lebanon, &quot;Mirage IIIDP&quot; for Pakistan, &quot;Mirage IIIBZ&quot; and &quot;Mirage IIIDZ&quot; and &quot;Mirage IIID2Z&quot; for South Africa, &quot;Mirage IIIDE&quot; for Spain and &quot;Mirage IIIDV&quot; for Venezuela.

After Israeli success with the Mirage IIIC, scoring kills against Syrian Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17s and MiG-21 aircraft and then achieving a formidable victory against Egypt, Jordan, and Syria in the Six-Day War of June 1967, the Mirage III&#x27;s earned a combat-proven service history. This and low cost made it a popular export success. According to Brindley, a key element of the Mirage III&#x27;s export success was the extensive support given to Dassault by the French government; he has claimed that the state would often commence negotiations without involving or informing Dassault at all until a later stage.

A good number of Mirage IIIEs were built for export as well, being purchased in small numbers by Argentina as the &quot;Mirage IIIEA&quot;, Brazil as the &quot;Mirage IIIEBR&quot;, Lebanon as the &quot;Mirage IIIEL&quot;, Pakistan as the &quot;Mirage IIIEP&quot;, South Africa as the &quot;Mirage IIIEZ&quot;, Spain as the &quot;Mirage IIIEE&quot;, and Venezuela as the &quot;Mirage IIIEV&quot;, with a list of subvariant designations, with minor variations in equipment fit. Dassault believed the customer was always right, and was happy to accommodate changes in equipment fit as customer needs and budget required.

Some customers obtained the two-seat Mirage IIIBE under the general designation &quot;Mirage IIID&quot;, though the trainers were generally similar to the Mirage IIIBE except for minor changes in equipment fit. In some cases they were identical, since two surplus AdA Mirage IIIBEs were sold to Brazil under the designation &quot;Mirage IIIBBR&quot;, and three were similarly sold to Egypt under the designation &quot;Mirage 5SDD&quot;. New-build exports of this type included aircraft sold to Abu Dhabi, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Egypt, Gabon, Libya, Pakistan, Peru, Spain, Venezuela, and Zaire.

During the 1960s, the Soviet Union was alleged to have been engaged in attempts at conducting industrial espionage that targeted Dassault and specifically the Mirage III. In one widely reported incident, a pilot of the Lebanese Air Force was approached by Soviet agents, who offered him a bribe to fly one of the nation&#x27;s 14 Mirage IIIs directly to Soviet territory; Lebanese counter-intelligence was notified of the attempt by the pilot. Diplomatically, France was protective of the fighter, often forbidding nations from re-exporting their Mirage IIIs to third parties without their consent under the threat of a prospective embargo.

Export versions of the Mirage IIIR were built for Pakistan as the &quot;Mirage IIIRP&quot; and &quot;Mirage IIIRP2&quot;, and South Africa as the &quot;Mirage IIIRZ&quot; and &quot;Mirage IIIR2Z&quot; with an Atar 9K-50 jet engine. Export versions of the IIIR recce aircraft were purchased by Abu Dhabi, Belgium, Colombia, Egypt, Libya, Pakistan, and South Africa. Some export Mirage IIIRDs were fitted with British Vinten cameras, not OMERA cameras. Most of the Belgian aircraft were built locally.

====Israel====
The Israeli Air Force (IAF) purchased three variants of the Mirage III:
* 70 Mirage IIICJ single-seat fighters, received between April 1962 and July 1964.
* Two Mirage IIIRJ single-seat photo-reconnaissance aircraft, received in March 1964.
* Four Mirage IIIBJ two-seat combat trainers, three received in 1966 and one in 1968.

Initial Israeli operations were conducted in a close cooperative relationship with both Dassault and France itself, the former sharing large amounts of operational data and experience with the other parties. However, Israel was forced into updating its own Mirages when France imposed an arms embargo on the region after the 1967 Six-Day War. For many years, official military relations did not exist between France and Israel, however, spare components remained available. The result of these troubles was the development of Israel Aircraft Industries&#x27; Nesher fighter, which was based on the Mirage 5. Nevertheless, Mirage IIIB upgrades up to and including a full Kfir-type conversion have also been made available to third parties by IAI.

====South Africa====

South Africa was amongst the earliest export customers for the Mirage III, having initially ordered a batch of 15 Mirage IIIC for low-level ground attack operations, for which they were armed with the Nord Aviation AS-20, along with three Mirage IIIBZ two-seater trainers. Further aircraft were ordered, including a batch of 16 Mirage IIIEs, three Mirage IIID two-seaters and four Mirage IIIR photo-reconnaissance aircraft. During the early 1970s, South Africa reportedly held negotiations with Dassault with the aim of securing a licence to produce either the Mirage III, the Mirage 5 and the Mirage F1.

However, much like Israel, South Africa was similarly isolated by a French arms embargo after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 418 in November 1977. The South African Air Force launched an ambitious rebuild programme for its Mirage III fleet, soliciting Israeli technical assistance to convert existing airframes into the Atlas Cheetah. Fixed foreplanes distinguish the Cheetah from its Mirage predecessor, and an extended nose, probably inspired by the IAI Kfir, houses a modified electronics suite, including radar. Built in single-seat, two-seat interceptor, and two-seat combat trainer versions, the Atlas Cheetah entered service in 1987 during the South African Border War. Armament consists of Denel Kukri or Darter heat-seeking air-to-air missiles, the targeting of which was aided by a pilot&#x27;s helmet mounted sight.

====Pakistan====

In 1967, Pakistan opted to purchase an initial batch of 18 Mirage IIIEPs, 3 Mirage IIIDPs and 3 Mirage IIIRPs from France. Over the course of time, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) inducted large numbers of new and secondhand Mirages IIIs and Mirage 5s spanning multiple variants. In 1977 and 1978, an additional 10 new Mirage IIIRP2s were delivered.

Perhaps the most notable PAF unit equipped with the type has been No. 5 Squadron, which was fully operational by the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. During the conflict, while flying out from bases in Sargodha and Mianwali, the Mirage III was used to conduct ground attacks against Indian military units and targets of interest. The PAF denied that any Mirage was lost. It was also confirmed by France that no fighter jet was missing from the total of 23 (a single aircraft had already been lost before the war).

In 1991, because French production of the Mirage III and most spare parts had ceased, Pakistan acquired 50 Australian-built Mirages, which had been retired by the Royal Australian Air Force in 1988: 42 examples of the Mirage IIIO and eight twin-seat IIID. A further five incomplete aircraft were also obtained from the RAAF for cannibalized spare parts. Eight of the ex-RAAF Mirages entered service with the PAF immediately, while another 33 were upgraded under a PAF project known as ROSE I (&quot;Retrofit of Strike Element&quot;), with new equipment including: head-up display (HUD), HOTAS controls, multi-function display (MFD), radar altimeter, nav/attack system (manufactured by SAGEM), inertial navigation and GPS systems, radar warning receiver (RWR), an electronic countermeasures (ECM) suite, decoy flares and chaff dispenser. In 1999, multi-mode FIAR Grifo M3 radar was installed in the PAF Mirages.&lt;ref name=&quot;flightglobal.com 24/02/99&quot;&gt;Paul Lewis, &quot;Building a base: Pakistan builds on the capabilities of local support for combat aircraft&quot;, &quot;Flight International&quot;, published: 24 February 1999, URL: http://www.flightglobal.com/articles/1999/02/24/48539/building-a-base.html Retrieved: 25 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten Lebanese Air Force aircraft were purchased in 2000 and in 2003 15 Mirage IIIEEs and 5 Mirage IIIDEs were obtained from the Spanish Air Force for cannibalized spare parts.

From 2011, the PAF Mirage fleet was modified to carry Hatf-VIII (Ra&#x27;ad) cruise missiles and to accommodate aerial refueling probes of South African origin (presumably similar to those installed on the Atlas Cheetah). Subsequently, these aircraft have been modified to accept additional equipment and munitions, such as Chinese PL-12 air-to-air missiles.

In 2019, the PAF was reported to be in negotiation with Egypt for purchase of 30 Mirages.

===License production===
Variants of the Mirage IIIE were built under license in both Australia (as the IIIO) by GAF, and Switzerland (as the IIIS) by F+W Emmen.

====Australia====


Australia first showed an official interest in replacing its CAC Sabre with the Mirage III in 1960, and initially considered a variant powered by a licence-built variant of the Rolls-Royce Avon turbojet (used by the CAC Sabre). While an experimental Avon-powered Mirage III was built as a prototype and flown in trials, it did not result in use of the Avon by a production variant.

The Australian government decided that the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) would receive a variant based on the Mirage IIIE and powered by the SNECMA Atar engine, built under license by Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) at Fishermans Bend, Melbourne. Known as the &quot;Mirage IIIO&quot; or GAF Mirage, the Australian variant differed from the Mirage IIIE mainly in its avionics. The other major Australian aircraft manufacturer at the time, the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC), also based in Melbourne, was also involved in the project, producing the Atar engine under licence.

Initially, Dassault provided a pair of pattern aircraft, the first of these flying in March 1963, which were transported to Australia and used to aid technicians at GAF in establishing their own assembly line for the type. GAF produced three variants: the &quot;Mirage IIIO(F)&quot;, which was an interceptor, the Mirage &quot;IIIO(A)&quot;, a surface attack aircraft and the twin seat &quot;Mirage IIIO(D)&quot;, a lead-in fighter trainer. GAF completed 48 Mirage IIIO(F), 50 Mirage IIIO(A) and 16 Mirage IIIO(D) aircraft.

Between 1967 and 1979, all the surviving Mirage IIIO(F) aircraft were converted to the Mirage IIIO(A) standard, which reconfigured them from the interceptor role to perform ground attack and aerial reconnaissance missions instead. In 1988, the Mirage III was finally withdrawn from RAAF service; 50 of the surviving fighters were exported to Pakistan in 1990. Several examples are preserved in museums around Australia; at least one of these is reportedly under restoration to a taxiable condition.

====Switzerland====

In 1961, Switzerland purchased a single Mirage IIIC from France for use as a development aircraft to support the nation&#x27;s intentions to domestically produce 100 Mirage III fighters for the Swiss Air Force. Accordingly, Mirages were manufactured in Switzerland by F+W Emmen (today RUAG, the federal government aircraft factory in Emmen) under the Mirage IIIS designation. The Mirage IIIS was intended to perform the attack, interception, and reconnaissance missions in a single model. However, the venture suffered considerable cost overruns, mainly due to Swiss-mandated customisations and features, this was compounded by a lack of financial oversight, controversy over the manufacturing cost ultimately cumulated in the so-called &quot;Mirage affair&quot; and the resignation of several officials. It became clear that a single model was not capable of the performance desires; thus only 36 Mirage IIIS interceptors and 18 Mirage IIIRS reconnaissance aircraft were eventually produced by F+W Emmen.

The Mirage IIIS was with considerably strengthened wings, airframe, and undercarriage as the Swiss Air Force had required robustness comparable to that of carrier-based planes. The reinforced airframes enabled aircraft to be moved by lifting them with a crane (hence the airframes also being fitted with four lifting points, retractable nosecones and lengthened nosewheel legs), as the aircraft caverns in the mountains that Swiss Air Force uses as bunkers offer very little space to maneuver parked aircraft. Another benefit of the strengthened frames was the enabling of JATO-assisted takeoffs, giving the type a short takeoff and landing (STOL) capability.

Other major differences were present on the Swiss-built interceptors. It was furnished with new American-sourced avionics along with a different cockpit design, including a Hughes Aircraft Company-built TARAN-18 radar system and could armed with the AIM-4 Falcon air-to-air missile (Swiss designation of the SAAB Licence built Robot 27 (Rb27), which is similar to the Hughes AIM-26 &quot;Falcon&quot;). In addition, the Mirage IIIS had the wiring to carry a Swiss-built or French-built nuclear bomb. In the event, the programme to produce a Swiss nuclear bomb was stopped in the pre-production stage and Switzerland chose not to purchase such weapons from France either. The Mirage IIIRS could also carry a centerline pod for conducting photo reconnaissance missions, as well as an integral fuel tank underneath the aft belly; this tank could carry a smaller fuel load, but also allowed for a rear-facing film camera to also be added. When fitted with the reconnaissance pod, supersonic performance was severely diminished. The Mirage IIIS could be optionally fitted with a SEPR (Société d&#x27;Etudes pour la Propulsion par Réaction) 844 rocket engine.

In 1967, the Mirage IIIS entered operational service with the Swiss Air Force; the Mirage IIIRS followed two years later. During their service life, Swiss Mirages received several upgrades, including the installation of a Martin-Baker Mk 6 ejection seat, a radar warning receiver, and a TRACOR AN/ALE-40 chaff/flare dispenser positioned at the back under the rear of the fuselage. Starting in 1988, canards and strakes designed by FFA and F+W in cooperation with Dassault, and produced in Switzerland, were fitted to the type. In 1999, Switzerland phased out the last of its Mirage IIIS fleet; the remaining Mirage IIIRS, BS and DS variants were taken out of service in 2003.

==Operational history==
===Israel===

On 29 November 1966, the pilot of an Israeli Air Force Dassault Mirage III shot down two Egyptian MiG-19s which were trying to intercept an Israeli reconnaissance Piper J-3 Cub in Israeli airspace. The first MiG was destroyed with a R.530 radar guided missile fired from less than a mile away, marking the first aerial kill for the French-made missile. The second MiG-19 was dispatched with cannon fire.

====Six-Day War====
During the Six-Day War, fought between 5 and 10 June 1967, Israel deployed a small detachment of 12 Mirages (comprising 4 permanently in the air and 8 at a high state of readiness on the ground) to defend the skies of Israel against attacks by hostile bombers, virtually all other Mirages were equipped with bombs and deployed on bombing raids against Arab air bases. Reportedly, the Mirage&#x27;s performance as a bomber was modest at best, perhaps due to its limited payload capacity. During the first day of combat, a total of 6 MiG fighters were claimed to have been shot down by Mirage pilots. During the following days, Israeli Mirages typically performed as fighters; out of a claimed total of 58 Arab aircraft shot down in air combat during the conflict, 48 were accounted for by Mirage pilots.

====Yom Kippur War====

During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Mirage fleet was solely engaged in air-to-air operations. ACIG.org claims that at least 26 Mirages and Neshers were lost in air-to-air combat during the war. Contrary to these claims, formal Israeli sources claim that only five Israeli Air Force aircraft were shot down in air-to-air dogfights. In comparison, 106 Syrian and Egyptian aircraft were claimed shot down by Israeli Mirage IIICJ planes, and another 140 aircraft were claimed by the Nesher derivative. Israeli Air Force pilot Giora Epstein, &quot;ace of aces&quot; of modern, supersonic fighter jets, achieved all of his victories flying either the Mirage IIICJ or the IAI Nesher (An Israeli derivative of the Mirage 5, which were in turn developed from the Mirage III).

===South Africa===
====Border War====
During the South African Border War, the South African Air Force operated a force of 16 Mirage IIICZ interceptors, 17 Mirage IIIEZ multirole fighter-bombers, and 4 Mirage IIIRZ reconnaissance fighters, which were typically flown from bases in South-West Africa. Despite being recognised as an exceptional dogfighter, the Mirage III was often criticised for lacking the range to make it effective over long distances, such as during strike operations against People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Namibia (PLAN) insurgents based in neighbouring Angola. South African pilots also found the high-nosed, delta-winged Mirage III relatively difficult to land on the rudimentary airstrips near the operational area.

Over time, the Mirage IIIs were eventually assigned to 2 Squadron, SAAF, and restricted to the secondary roles of daytime interception, training exercises, and photographic reconnaissance missions following the adoption of the newer Mirage F1. The mediocre performance of the fighter&#x27;s Cyrano II radar effectively precluded the type from conducting nighttime operations, as well as during challenging weather conditions. By the late 1980s, the Mirage IIICZ was considered so obsolete that it was utilised only for base security. Nevertheless, the Mirage IIIRZ continued to be deployed for photo reconnaissance missions over Angolan targets, as the SAAF had only one other aircraft equipped for this role, the even more antiquated English Electric Canberra.

During reconnaissance missions, SAAF Mirage IIIRZs would often fly at extremely low altitudes, sometimes as low as ; briefly prior to reaching their intended targets, the aircraft would enter a rapid climb from which photographs would be taken before turning away. During the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Mirage IIIRZ pilots carried out mock sorties over enemy positions in Xangongo and Humbe in an attempt to provoke a response from Cuban or Angolan MiG-21s and MiG-23s, which would then be engaged by accompanying SAAF Mirage F1AZs.

===Pakistan===

==== Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 ====

During the 1971 War, PAF Mirages were used in preemptive strikes and also claimed the first aerial victories against Indian Airforce Canberra bombers and reconnaissance aircraft in the Western Front, along with Su-7 and Hawker Hunter. During the war, the Mirages were frequently employed for Airfield Interdiction, strike, as well as CAP missions; whereas the tasks of Close Air Support and Battlefield Air Interdiction were taken up by F-86 Sabres and Shenyang F-6P aircraft.
Moreover, during the War on terror, Pakistani Mirage-III &amp; Mirage-V jets were deployed in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province after the spillover of militants from Afghanistan in 2001. They performed Close Air Support missions throughout the conflict.

==== Operation Swift Retort ====

In February 2019, the Indian Air Force bombed a training camp of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed. in Balakot after violating Pakistan&#x27;s airspace. In response, then Prime Minister Imran Khan ordered the Air Force to perform retaliatory airstrikes on Indian military installations at Indian Administered Kashmir. The retaliatory airstrikes were codenamed &quot;Operation Swift Retort&quot; and for this purpose, Two Dassault Mirage 5PAs armed with H-4 SOW glide bombs and two dual seat Mirage IIIDAs from the No. 15 Squadron were deployed for the mission. In the early hours of 27 February, the Mirages carried out the airstrikes while JF-17s and F-16s from other squadrons provided escort and CAP. The Mirage 5PAs dropped their payloads while the Weapon Systems Officers in the Mirage IIIDAs guided the bombs to their respective targets via data link.

===Argentina===
====Falklands War====
The Argentine Air Force deployed their Mirage IIIEA fleet during the 1982 Falklands War. Their ability to function as long-range strike aircraft was dramatically hindered by the type&#x27;s lack of any aerial refueling capability; even when furnished with a pair of 2,000-litre (550-gallon) drop tanks to carry extra fuel, the Mirages (and Israeli-built Daggers) would be forced to fly up to the absolute limit of their range in order to even reach the British fleet from the mainland. Normally, the fighters would be sent to engage patrolling British Harrier jets and to provide air cover to a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk strike force; however, they would have no more than five minutes at most over the combat area before having to embark upon the return flight back to their airfields.

Usually, Argentine Mirages were flown with an armament consisting of one Matra R530 or a pair of Magic 1 AAMs. They only entered direct combat once, resulting in one of the Mirages being shot down by an AIM-9L Sidewinder fired by a Harrier, and another destroyed by friendly fire after attempting to land on the runway at Port Stanley when nearly out of fuel. The fighters were frequently deployed to conduct diversion flights, flying at a very high altitude to force a response from the patrolling British Harriers to improve the chances of survival and success of the attack force. Additionally, a number of Mirages were also kept on a high state of alert against possible Avro Vulcan raids upon targets within the Argentine mainland, as well as to serve as a deterrence against aggressive flights by neighbouring Chile conducted upon Argentina&#x27;s western border.

* The &quot;Mirage IIIM&quot; was a carrier-based variant, with catapult spool and arresting hook, for operation with the French &quot;Aéronavale&quot;.
* The &quot;Mirage IIIW&quot; was a lightweight fighter version, proposed for a US competition, with Dassault partnered with Boeing. The aircraft would have been produced by Boeing, but it lost to the Northrop F-5.

===Derivatives===

====Mirage 5/Mirage 50====
The next major variant, the &quot;Mirage 5&quot;, grew out of a request to Dassault from the Israeli Air Force. The first Mirage 5 flew on 19 May 1967. It looked much like the Mirage III, except it had a long slender nose that extended the aircraft&#x27;s length by about half a meter. The Mirage 5 itself led directly to the Israeli &quot;Nesher&quot;, either through a Mossad (Israeli intelligence) intelligence operation or through covert cooperation with AdA, depending upon which story is accepted. (See details in the &quot;Nesher&quot; article). In either case, the design gave rise to the &quot;Kfir&quot;, which can be considered a direct descendant of the &quot;Mirage III&quot;.

====Milan====
In 1968, Dassault, in cooperation with the Swiss, began work on a Mirage update known as the Milan (&quot;Kite&quot;). The main feature of the &quot;Milan&quot; was a pair of pop-out foreplanes in the nose, which were referred to as &quot;moustaches&quot;. The moustaches were intended to provide better take-off performance and low-speed control for the attack role. The three initial prototypes were converted from existing Mirage fighters; one of these prototypes was nicknamed &quot;Asterix&quot;, after the internationally popular French cartoon character, a tough little Gallic warrior with a huge moustache.

A fully equipped prototype rebuilt from a &quot;Mirage IIIR&quot; flew in May 1970, and was powered by the uprated afterburning thrust SNECMA Atar 09K-50 engine, following the evaluation of an earlier model of this new series on the one-off &quot;Mirage IIIC2&quot;. The Milan also had updated avionics, including a laser designator and rangefinder in the nose. A second fully equipped prototype was produced for Swiss evaluation as the &quot;Milan S&quot;. The canards did provide significant handling benefits, but they had drawbacks. They blocked the pilot&#x27;s forward view to an extent, and set up turbulence in the engine intakes. The Milan concept was abandoned in 1972, while work continued on achieving the same goals with canards.

====Mirage IIING====
Following the development of the Mirage 50, Dassault had experimented with yet another derivative of the original Mirage series, named the &quot;Mirage IIING&quot; (&quot;Nouvelle Génération&quot;, new generation). Like the Milan and Mirage 50, the IIING was powered by the Atar 9K-50 engine. The prototype, a conversion of a Mirage IIIR, flew on 21 December 1982.

The Mirage IIING had a modified delta wing with leading-edge root extensions, plus a pair of fixed canards fitted above and behind the air intakes. The aircraft&#x27;s avionics were completely modernized, making use of the parallel development effort underway for the next-generation Mirage 2000 fighter. Chiefly amongst these changes, the Mirage IIING used a fly-by-wire system to allow control over the aircraft&#x27;s relaxed stability. The aircraft had an improved nav/attack system with inertial navigation and a head-up display. A variety of radars could be fitted, including the Cyrano IV and Agave and these could be supplemented by a laser rangefinder. The uprated engine and aerodynamics improved take-off and sustained turn performance.

Ultimately, the type never went into production, but to an extent the Mirage IIING was a demonstrator for various technologies that could be and were featured in upgrades to existing Mirage IIIs and Mirage 5s. After 1989, enhancements derived from the Mirage IIING were incorporated into Brazilian Mirage IIIEs, as well as into four ex-&quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; Mirage IIIEs that were transferred to Brazil in 1988. In 1989, Dassault offered a similar upgrade refit of ex-AdA Mirage IIIEs under the designation &quot;Mirage IIIEX&quot;, featuring canards, a fixed in-flight refueling probe, a longer nose, new avionics, and other refinements.

====Balzac / Mirage IIIV====

One of the offshoots of the Mirage III/5/50 fighter family tree was the &quot;Mirage IIIV&quot; vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) fighter. (&quot;IIIV&quot; is read &quot;three-vee,&quot; not &quot;three-five&quot;). This aircraft featured eight small vertical lift jets straddling the main engine. The Mirage IIIV was built in response to a mid-1960s NATO specification for a VTOL strike fighter. It used eight RB.162-31 lift engines(generating 5,400 lb thrust each), long-stroke landing gears, and additional covers to reduce impact of the lift engine exhausts. The main engine was a SNECMA TF-104 turbojet.

====Mirage III ROSE====
Project ROSE (Retrofit Of Strike Element) was an upgrade programme launched by the Pakistan Air Force to upgrade old Dassault Mirage III and Mirage 5 aircraft with modern avionics. In the early 1990s, the PAF procured 50 ex-Australian Mirage III fighters, 33 of which were selected after an inspection to undergo upgrades. In the first phases of Project ROSE, the ex-Australian Mirage III fighters were fitted with new defensive systems and cockpits, which included new HUDs, MFDs, RWRs, HOTAS controls, radar altimeters and navigation/attack systems. They were also fitted with the FIAR Grifo M3 multi-mode radar and designated &quot;ROSE I&quot;. Around 34 Mirage 5 attack fighters also underwent upgrades designated &quot;ROSE II&quot; and &quot;ROSE III&quot; before Project ROSE was completed.

<text>Ernst Didring (18 October 1868 – 13 October 1931) was an early 20th-century author who wrote mainly of life in his home country of Sweden.

==Biography==
Born 18 October 1868 in Stockholm, Didring aspired to a career in teaching, but was unable to complete his studies due to lack of money. Instead, by 1884 he was working as an office clerk in the head office of the Swedish railways, and in 1899 he married a Danish teacher, Jeanne Rye. He was very involved in the founding of , the railroad pension, in 1910, and was a full-time writer from 1914. Between 1915 and 1920 he was the leader of the Swedish Red Cross for prisoners of the war. Also during that time, and then again in 1923 to 1929, he was the leader of Sweden&#x27;s writers society. In the intervening years (1920–1922) he traveled through Europe (France, Switzerland, Italy and Germany). In 1931 he was awarded the prestigious &quot;Large Prize&quot; by the literary institution &quot;Samfundet De Nio&quot;. He died, aged 62, in Stockholm.

==Works==

Ernst Didring was a proponent of naturalism.

His main series and best known book is the novel trilogy (&#x27;iron ore&#x27;) which was published between 1914 and 1925. It describes life in the north of Sweden at the beginning of the 20th century. 
# &quot;Pioneers&quot;: a detailed description of the construction of the railway from Kiruna to Narvik.
# &quot;The Mountain&#x27;s Song&quot;: portrays work in the mining company.
# &quot;Speculators&quot;: the last part describes shareholders of the iron companies in Stockholm – the ups and downs before World War I.

Some of his other novels are also important in the history of Swedish literature: 
# : former life in the Stockholm archipelago (1925–27);
# : &#x27;The World&#x27;s Spider&#x27; (circa 1925);
# : &#x27;The Dark Blue Stamp&#x27; (1932).

They paint a comprehensive picture of life in Swedish society around 1900 which is relevant even today. Often there were only several months between the publication of the original book and translation to other European languages. His work was especially well-recognized in Germany. Didring also wrote some theater plays which were well known in Stockholm in his time.

Many of his books can still be bought in second-hand bookshops or loaned from Swedish or German libraries.
There are also some unabridged audiobooks available from the Swedish Agency for Accessible Media&#x27;s digital library Legimus.

<doc id="172348" wikidata="Q2994681" url="?curid=172348" title="Thrust-specific fuel consumption">
<text>Thrust-specific fuel consumption (TSFC) is the fuel efficiency of an engine design with respect to thrust output. TSFC may also be thought of as fuel consumption (grams/second) per unit of thrust (newtons, or N), hence &quot;thrust-specific&quot;. This figure is inversely proportional to specific impulse, which is the amount of thrust produced per unit fuel consumed.

TSFC or SFC for thrust engines (e.g. turbojets, turbofans, ramjets, rockets, etc.) is the mass of fuel needed to provide the net thrust for a given period e.g. lb/(h·lbf) (pounds of fuel per hour-pound of thrust) or g/(s·kN) (grams of fuel per second-kilonewton). Mass of fuel is used, rather than volume (gallons or litres) for the fuel measure, since it is independent of temperature.

Specific fuel consumption of air-breathing jet engines at their maximum efficiency is more or less proportional to exhaust speed. The fuel consumption &quot;per mile&quot; or &quot;per kilometre&quot; is a more appropriate comparison for aircraft that travel at very different speeds. There also exists power-specific fuel consumption, which equals the thrust-specific fuel consumption divided by speed. It can have units of pounds per hour per horsepower.

==Significance of SFC==
SFC is dependent on engine design, but differences in the SFC between different engines using the same underlying technology tend to be quite small. Increasing overall pressure ratio on jet engines tends to decrease SFC.

In practical applications, other factors are usually highly significant in determining the fuel efficiency of a particular engine design in that particular application. For instance, in aircraft, turbine (jet and turboprop) engines are typically much smaller and lighter than equivalently powerful piston engine designs, both properties reducing the levels of drag on the plane and reducing the amount of power needed to move the aircraft. Therefore, turbines are more efficient for aircraft propulsion than might be indicated by a simplistic look at the table below.

SFC varies with throttle setting, altitude, climate. For jet engines, air flight speed is an important factor too. 
Air flight speed counteracts the jet&#x27;s exhaust speed. (In an artificial and extreme case with the aircraft flying exactly at the exhaust speed, one can easily imagine why the jet&#x27;s net thrust should be near zero.) Moreover, since work is force (&quot;i.e&quot;., thrust) times distance, mechanical power is force times speed. Thus, although the nominal SFC is a useful measure of fuel efficiency, it should be divided by speed when comparing engines at different speeds.

For example, Concorde cruised at 1354 mph, or 7.15 million feet per hour, with its engines giving an SFC of 1.195 lb/(lbf·h) (see below); this means the engines transferred 5.98 million foot pounds per pound of fuel (17.9 MJ/kg), equivalent to an SFC of 0.50 lb/(lbf·h) for a subsonic aircraft flying at 570 mph, which would be better than even modern engines; the Olympus 593 used in the Concorde was the world&#x27;s most efficient jet engine. However, Concorde ultimately has a heavier airframe and, due to being supersonic, is less aerodynamically efficient, i.e., the lift to drag ratio is far lower. In general, the total fuel burn of a complete aircraft is of far more importance to the customer.

==Units==

==Typical values of SFC for thrust engines==


The following table gives the efficiency for several engines when running at 80% throttle, which is approximately what is used in cruising, giving a minimum SFC. The efficiency is the amount of power propelling the plane divided by the rate of energy consumption. Since the power equals thrust times speed, the efficiency is given by
:formula_1
where V is speed and h is the energy content per unit mass of fuel (the higher heating value is used here, and at higher speeds the kinetic energy of the fuel or propellant becomes substantial and must be included).

<text>The Age is a daily newspaper in Melbourne, Australia, that has been published since 1854. Owned and published by Nine Entertainment, &quot;The Age&quot; primarily serves Victoria, but copies also sell in Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and border regions of South Australia and southern New South Wales. It is delivered both in print and digital formats. The newspaper shares some articles with its sister newspaper &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

&quot;The Age&quot; is considered a newspaper of record for Australia, and has variously been known for its investigative reporting, with its journalists having won dozens of Walkley Awards, Australia&#x27;s most prestigious journalism prize. , &quot;The Age&quot; had a monthly readership of 5.4 million. , this had fallen to 4.55 million.

==History==
=== Foundation ===
&quot;The Age&quot; was founded by three Melbourne businessmen: brothers John and Henry Cooke (who had arrived from New Zealand in the 1840s) and Walter Powell. The first edition appeared on 17 October 1854.

===Syme family===
The venture was not initially a success, and in June 1856 the Cookes sold the paper to Ebenezer Syme, a Scottish-born businessman, and James McEwan, an ironmonger and founder of McEwans &amp; Co, for £2,000 at auction. The first edition under the new owners came out on 17 June 1856. From its foundation the paper was self-consciously liberal in its politics: &quot;aiming at a wide extension of the rights of free citizenship and a full development of representative institutions&quot;, and supporting &quot;the removal of all restrictions upon freedom of commerce, freedom of religion and—to the utmost extent that is compatible with public morality—upon freedom of personal action&quot;.

Ebenezer Syme was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly shortly after buying &quot;The Age&quot;, and his brother David Syme soon came to dominate the paper, editorially and managerially. When Ebenezer died in 1860 David became editor-in-chief, a position he retained until his death in 1908, although a succession of editors did the day-to-day editorial work.

In 1882 &quot;The Age&quot; published an eight-part series written by journalist and future physician George E. Morrison, who had sailed, undercover, for the New Hebrides, while posing as crew of the brigantine slave ship, &quot;Lavinia&quot;, as it made cargo of Kanakas. By October the series was also being published in &quot;The Age&quot;″s weekly companion magazine, the &quot;Leader&quot;. &quot;A Cruise in a Queensland Slaver. By a Medical Student&quot; was written in a tone of wonder, expressing &quot;only the mildest criticism&quot;; six months later, Morrison &quot;revised his original assessment&quot;, describing details of the schooner&#x27;s blackbirding operation, and sharply denouncing the slave trade in Queensland. His articles, letters to the editor, and newspaper&#x27;s editorials, led to expanded government intervention.

In 1891, Syme bought out Ebenezer&#x27;s heirs and the McEwans and became sole proprietor. He built up &quot;The Age&quot; into Victoria&#x27;s leading newspaper. In circulation, it soon overtook its rivals &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The Argus&quot;, and by 1890 it was selling 100,000 copies a day, making it one of the world&#x27;s most successful newspapers.
Under Syme&#x27;s control &quot;The Age&quot; exercised enormous political power in Victoria. It supported liberal politicians such as Graham Berry, George Higinbotham and George Turner, and other leading liberals such as Alfred Deakin and Charles Pearson furthered their careers as &quot;The Age&quot; journalists. Syme was originally a free trader, but converted to protectionism through his belief that Victoria needed to develop its manufacturing industries behind tariff barriers. During the 1890s &quot;The Age&quot; was a leading supporter of Australian federation and of the White Australia policy.

After David Syme&#x27;s death, the paper remained in the hands of his three sons, and his eldest son Herbert became general manager until his death in 1939.

David Syme&#x27;s will prevented the sale of any equity in the paper during his sons&#x27; lifetimes, an arrangement designed to protect family control, but which had the unintended consequence of starving the paper of investment capital for 40 years.

Under the management of Sir Geoffrey Syme (1908–42), and his editors, Gottlieb Schuler and Harold Campbell, &quot;The Age&quot; was unable to modernise, and gradually lost market share to &quot;The Argus&quot; and the tabloid &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot;, with only its classified advertisement sections keeping the paper profitable. By the 1940s, the paper&#x27;s circulation was lower than it had been in 1900, and its political influence had also declined. Although it remained more liberal than the extremely conservative &quot;Argus&quot;, it lost much of its distinct political identity.

The historian Sybil Nolan writes: &quot;Accounts of &quot;The Age&quot; in these years generally suggest that the paper was second-rate, outdated in both its outlook and appearance. Walker described a newspaper which had fallen asleep in the embrace of the Liberal Party; &#x27;querulous&#x27;, &#x27;doddery&#x27; and &#x27;turgid&#x27; are some of the epithets applied by other journalists. It is inevitably criticised not only for its increasing conservatism, but for its failure to keep pace with innovations in layout and editorial technique so dramatically demonstrated in papers like &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot; and &quot;The Herald&quot;.&quot;

In 1942, David Syme&#x27;s last surviving son, Oswald, took over the paper, and began to modernise the paper&#x27;s appearance and standards of news coverage, removing classified advertisements from the front page and introducing photographs long after other papers had done so.

In 1948, after realising the paper needed outside capital, Oswald persuaded the courts to overturn his father&#x27;s will and floated David Syme and Co. as a public company, selling £400,000 worth of shares. This sale enabled a badly needed technical upgrade of the newspaper&#x27;s antiquated production machinery, and defeated a takeover attempt by the Fairfax family, publishers of the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

This new lease on life allowed &quot;The Age&quot; to recover commercially, and in 1957 it received a great boost when &quot;The Argus&quot;, after twenty years of financial losses, ceased publication.

===1960–present===

Oswald Syme retired in 1964 and his grandson Ranald Macdonald was appointed managing director at the age of 26 and two years later he appointed Graham Perkin as editor; to ensure that the 36-year-old Perkin was free of board influence, Macdonald took on the role of editor-in-chief, a position he held until 1970. Together they radically changed the paper&#x27;s format and shifted its editorial line from rather conservative liberalism to a new &quot;left liberalism&quot; characterised by attention to issues such as race, gender, the disabled and the environment, as well as opposition to White Australia and the death penalty.

It also became more supportive of the Australian Labor Party after years of having usually supported the Coalition. The Liberal Premier of Victoria, Henry Bolte, subsequently called &quot;The Age&quot; &quot;that pinko rag&quot; in a view conservatives have maintained ever since. Former editor Michael Gawenda in his book &quot;American Notebook&quot; wrote that the &quot;default position of most journalists at &quot;The Age&quot; was on the political Left&quot;. In 1966, the Syme family shareholders joined with Fairfax to create a 50/50 voting partnership which guaranteed editorial independence and forestalled takeover moves from newspaper proprietors in Australia and overseas. This lasted for 17 years, until Fairfax bought controlling interest in 1972.

Perkin&#x27;s editorship coincided with Gough Whitlam&#x27;s reforms of the Labor Party, and &quot;The Age&quot; became a key supporter of the Whitlam government, which came to power in 1972. Contrary to subsequent mythology, however, &quot;The Age&quot; was not an uncritical supporter of Whitlam, and played a leading role in exposing the Loans Affair, one of the scandals which contributed to the demise of the Whitlam government. It was one of many papers to call for Whitlam&#x27;s resignation on 15 October 1975. Its editorial that day, &quot;Go now, go decently&quot;, began, &quot;We will say it straight, and clear, and at once. The Whitlam government has run its course.&quot; It would be Perkin&#x27;s last editorial; he died the next day.

After Perkin&#x27;s death, &quot;The Age&quot; returned to a more moderate liberal position. While it criticised Whitlam&#x27;s dismissal later that year, it supported Malcolm Fraser&#x27;s Liberal government in its early years. However, after 1980 it became increasingly critical and was a leading supporter of Bob Hawke&#x27;s reforming government after 1983. But from the 1970s, the political influence of &quot;The Age&quot;, as with other broadsheet newspapers, derived less from what it said in its editorial columns (which relatively few people read) than from the opinions expressed by journalists, cartoonists, feature writers and guest columnists. &quot;The Age&quot; has always kept a stable of leading editorial cartoonists, notably Les Tanner, Bruce Petty, Ron Tandberg and Michael Leunig.

In 1983, Fairfax bought out the remaining shares in David Syme &amp; Co., which became a subsidiary of John Fairfax &amp; Co. Macdonald was criticised by some members of the Syme family (who nevertheless accepted Fairfax&#x27;s generous offer for their shares), but he argued that &quot;The Age&quot; was a natural partner for Fairfax&#x27;s flagship property, &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;. He believed the greater resources of the Fairfax group would enable &quot;The Age&quot; to remain competitive. By the mid-1960s a new competitor had appeared in Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s national daily &quot;The Australian&quot;, which was first published on 15 July 1964. In 1999 David Syme &amp; Co. became The Age Company Ltd, finally ending the Syme connection.

&quot;The Age&quot; was published from offices in Collins Street until 1969, when it moved to 250 Spencer Street (hence the nickname &quot;The Spencer Street Soviet&quot; favoured by some critics). In 2003, &quot;The Age&quot; opened a new printing centre at Tullamarine. The headquarters moved again in 2009 to Collins Street opposite Southern Cross station. Since acquisition by Nine Entertainment, the headquarters moved to the former&#x27;s 717 Bourke Street.

In 2004, editor Michael Gawenda was succeeded as editor by British journalist Andrew Jaspan, who was in turn replaced by Paul Ramadge in 2008.

&quot;The Age&quot; has been known for its tradition of investigative reporting. In 1984, the newspaper reported what became known as &quot;The Age Tapes&quot; affair, which revealed recordings made by police of alleged corrupt dealings between organised crime figures, politicians and public officials and which sparked the Stewart Royal Commission. The paper&#x27;s extensive reporting on malpractice in Australia&#x27;s banking sector led to a Royal Commission being announced by the Turnbull government into the financial services industry, and with &quot;The Age&#x27;s&quot; journalist Adele Ferguson awarded the Gold Walkley. A series of stories in &quot;The Age&quot; between 2009 and 2015 about alleged corruption involving subsidiaries of Australia&#x27;s central bank, the Reserve Bank, led to Australia&#x27;s first ever prosecutions of companies and businessman for foreign bribery. &quot;The Age&#x27;s&quot; reporting of the Unaoil international bribery scandal led to investigations by anti-corruption agencies in the UK, US, across Europe and Australia and several businessmen pleading guilty for paying bribes in nine countries over 17 years.

In February 2007, &quot;The Age&#x27;s&quot; editorial section argued that Australian citizen David Hicks should be released as a prisoner from Guantanamo Bay, stating that Mr Hicks was no hero and &quot;probably downright deluded and dangerous&quot; but the case for releasing him was just, given he was being held without charge or trial.

In 2009, &quot;The Age&quot; suspended its columnist Michael Backman after one of his columns condemned Israeli tourists as greedy and badly behaved, prompting criticism that he was antisemitic. A Press Council complaint against &quot;The Age&quot; for its handling of the complaints against Backman was dismissed.

In 2014 &quot;The Age&quot; put a photograph of an innocent man, Abu Bakar Alam, on the front page, mistakenly identifying him as the perpetrator of the 2014 Endeavour Hills stabbings. As part of the settlement the newspaper donated $20,000 towards building a mosque in nearby Doveton.

, three editions of &quot;The Age&quot; are printed nightly: the NAA edition, for interstate and country Victorian readers, the MEA edition, for metropolitan areas and a final late metropolitan edition.

In March 2013, &quot;The Age&quot; moved from its traditional broadsheet format to the smaller tabloid (or compact) format, along with its Fairfax stablemate &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;.

In December 2016, editor-in-chief Mark Forbes was stood down from his position pending the result of a sexual harassment investigation and was replaced by Alex Lavelle, who served for four years as chief editor.

In September 2020, it was announced that &quot;The Age&quot;″s former Washington correspondent Gay Alcorn would be appointed editor, the first woman to hold the position in the paper&#x27;s history. Alcorn left the position in December 2022 and was succeeded by Patrick Elligett in January 2023.

==Headquarters==
&quot;The Age&quot;″s purpose-built former headquarters, named Media House, was located at 655 Collins Street. After acquisition by Nine, &quot;The Age&quot; moved to 717 Bourke Street to be co-located with its new owners.

==Masthead==
&quot;The Age&quot;″s masthead has received a number of updates since 1854. The most recent update to the design was made in 2002. The current masthead features a stylised version of the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom and &quot;The Age&quot; in Electra bold type. The coat of arms features the French motto (). According to &quot;The Age&quot;″s art director, Bill Farr: &quot;No one knows why they picked the royal crest. But I guess we were a colony at the time, and to be seen to be linked with the Empire would be a positive thing.&quot; The original 1854 masthead included the Colony of Victoria crest. In 1856, that crest was removed and in 1861, the royal coat of arms was introduced. This was changed again in 1967, with the shield and decoration altered and the lion crowned. In 1971, a bold typeface was introduced and the crest shield rounded and less ornate. In 1997, the masthead was stacked and contained in a blue box (with the logo in white). In 2002, in conjunction with an overall revamp of the paper, the masthead was redesigned in its present form.

==Readership==
, &quot;The Age&quot; had a monthly readership of 5.4 million.
, this had fallen to 4.55 million. 

==Awards==

=== Current journalists ===
The below is a list of The Age&#x27;s current journalists.

==Photography==
Though Hugh Bull was appointed the newspaper&#x27;s first full-time photographer as early as 1927, it was comparatively late in the history of &quot;The Age&quot; that photographs were used on the front page as a matter of course, but they became, especially under the editorship of Graham Perkin and his successors, a vital part of its identity, with picture credits for staff photographers, and their images, often uncropped, run across several columns.

A photographer of the rival &quot;Herald Sun&quot; Jay Town distinguishes the &#x27;house style&#x27;; &quot;There&#x27;s a big difference between the set-up, cheesy, tight and bright &quot;Herald Sun&quot;-type [photograph] and then the nice, broadsheet picture–well, back when the Age was a fantastic broadsheet that could really showcase their photographers&#x27; work.&quot; This distinction was to start to break down in 1983 with the pooling of photographers across all Fairfax publications, and the paper&#x27;s change in format from broadsheet to &#x27;compact&#x27; in 2007, preceding move to online publication and subscription; 2014 saw Fairfax Media shedding 75 per cent of its photographers.

In its heyday the newspaper was a significant step in the career of notable Australian news photographers and photojournalists, many of whom started as cadets. They include:
* Hugh Bull
* Bryan Charlton
* John Lamb
* Ron Lovitt
* Bill McAuley
* Fiona McDougall
* Justin McManus
* Simon O&#x27;Dwyer
* Bruce Postle
* Michael Rayner
* Sandy Scheltema
* Jason South
* Penny Stephens

==Ownership==

In 1972, John Fairfax Holdings bought a majority of David Syme&#x27;s shares, and in 1983 bought out all the remaining shares.

On 26 July 2018, Nine Entertainment Co. and Fairfax Media, the parent company of &quot;The Age&quot;, announced they agreed on terms for a merger between the two companies to become Australia&#x27;s largest media company. Nine shareholders will own 51.1 per cent of the combined entity, and Fairfax shareholders will own 48.9 per cent.

==Printing==
&quot;The Age&quot; was published from its office in Collins Street until 1969, when the newspaper moved to 250 Spencer Street. In July 2003, the $220 million five-storey Age Print Centre was opened at Tullamarine. The Centre produced a wide range of publications for both Fairfax and commercial clients. Among its stable of daily print publications are &quot;The Age&quot;, the &quot;Australian Financial Review&quot; and the &quot;Bendigo Advertiser&quot;. The building was sold in 2014, and printing was to be transferred to &quot;regional presses&quot;.

<doc id="172351" wikidata="Q640097" url="?curid=172351" title="Electric blues">
<text>Electric blues is blues music distinguished by the use of electric amplification for musical instruments. The guitar was the first instrument to be popularly amplified and used by early pioneers T-Bone Walker in the late 1930s and John Lee Hooker and Muddy Waters in the 1940s. Their styles developed into West Coast blues, Detroit blues, and post-World War II Chicago blues, which differed from earlier, predominantly acoustic-style blues. By the early 1950s, Little Walter was a featured soloist on blues harmonica using a small hand-held microphone fed into a guitar amplifier. Although it took a little longer, the electric bass guitar gradually replaced the stand-up bass by the early 1960s. Keyboards, especially electric organs and electric pianos, later became widely used in electric blues.

==Early regional styles==

The blues, like jazz, probably began to be amplified in the late 1930s. The first star of the electric blues is generally recognized as being T-Bone Walker; born in Texas but moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1930s, he combined blues with elements of swing music and jazz in a long and prolific career. After World War II, amplified blues music became popular in American cities that had seen widespread African American migration, such as Chicago, Memphis, Detroit, St. Louis, and the West Coast. The initial impulse was to be heard above the noise of lively rent parties. Playing in small venues, electric blues bands tended to remain modest in size compared with larger jazz bands. In its early stages electric blues typically used amplified electric guitars, double bass (which was progressively replaced by bass guitar), and harmonica played through a microphone and a power amp or a guitar amplifier.

By the late 1940s several Chicago-based blues artists had begun to use amplification, including John Lee Williamson and Johnny Shines. Early recordings in the new style were made in 1947 and 1948 by musicians such as Johnny Young, Floyd Jones, and Snooky Pryor. The format was perfected by Muddy Waters, who utilized various small groups that provided a strong rhythm section and powerful harmonica. His &quot;I Can&#x27;t Be Satisfied&quot; (1948) was followed by a series of ground-breaking recordings. Chicago blues is influenced to a large extent by the Mississippi blues style, because many performers had migrated from the Mississippi region. Howlin&#x27; Wolf, Muddy Waters, Willie Dixon and Jimmy Reed were all born in Mississippi and moved to Chicago during the Great Migration. In addition to electric guitar, harmonica, and a rhythm section of bass and drums, some performers such as J. T. Brown who played in Elmore James&#x27;s bands or J. B. Lenoir&#x27;s also used saxophones, largely as a supporting instrument. Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson (Rice Miller) and Big Walter Horton were among the best-known harmonica (called &quot;blues harp&quot; by blues musicians) players of the early Chicago blues scene and the sound of electric instruments and harmonica is often seen as characteristic of electric Chicago blues. Muddy Waters and Elmore James were known for their innovative use of slide electric guitar. Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters were for their deep, &quot;gravelly&quot; voices. Bassist and composer Willie Dixon played a major role on the Chicago blues scene. He composed and wrote many standard blues songs of the period, such as &quot;Hoochie Coochie Man&quot;, &quot;I Just Want to Make Love to You&quot; (both penned for Muddy Waters) and, &quot;Wang Dang Doodle&quot;, &quot;Spoonful&quot; and &quot;Back Door Man&quot; for Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Most artists of the Chicago blues style recorded for the Chicago-based Chess Records and Checker Records labels; there were also smaller blues labels in this era including Vee-Jay Records and J.O.B. Records.

In the late 1950s, the West Side style blues emerged in Chicago with major figures including Magic Sam, Jimmy Dawkins, Magic Slim and Otis Rush. West Side clubs were more accessible to white audiences, but performers were mainly black, or part of mixed combos. West Side blues incorporated elements of blues rock but with a greater emphasis on standards and traditional blues song forms. Albert King, Buddy Guy, and Luther Allison had a West Side style that was dominated by amplified electric lead guitar.

Memphis, with its flourishing acoustic blues scene based in Beale Street, also developed an electric blues sound during the early 1950s. Sam Phillips&#x27; Sun Records company recorded musicians such as Howlin&#x27; Wolf (before he moved to Chicago), Willie Nix, Ike Turner, and B.B. King. Other Memphis blues musicians involved with Sun Records included Joe Hill Louis, Willie Johnson and Pat Hare who introduced electric guitar techniques such as distorted and power chords, anticipating elements of heavy metal music. These players had an influence on early rock and rollers and rockabillies, many of whom also recorded for Sun Records. After Phillips discovered Elvis Presley in 1954, the Sun label turned to the rapidly expanding white audience and started recording mostly rock and roll. Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s carried the electric blues style into the 1960s.

Detroit-based John Lee Hooker pursued a unique brand of electric blues based on his deep rough voice accompanied by a single electric guitar. Though not directly influenced by boogie-woogie, his &quot;groovy&quot; style is sometimes called &quot;guitar boogie&quot;. His first hit, &quot;Boogie Chillen&quot;, reached #1 on the R&amp;B charts in 1949. He continued to play and record until his death in 2001.

The New Orleans blues musician Guitar Slim recorded &quot;The Things That I Used to Do&quot; (1953), which featured an electric guitar solo with distorted overtones and became a major R&amp;B hit in 1954. It is regarded as one of The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll, and contributed to the development of soul music.

In the 1950s, blues had a huge influence on mainstream American popular music. While popular musicians like Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, both recording for Chess, were influenced by the Chicago blues, their enthusiastic playing styles departed from the melancholy aspects of blues and played a major role in the development of rock and roll. Chicago blues also influenced Louisiana&#x27;s zydeco music, with Clifton Chenier using blues accents. Zydeco musicians used electric solo guitar and cajun arrangements of blues standards.

==British electric styles==

British blues emerged from the skiffle and folk club scene of the late 1950s, particularly in London, which included the playing of American acoustic blues. Critical was the visit of Muddy Waters in 1958, who initially shocked British audiences by playing amplified electric blues, but who was soon performing to ecstatic crowds and rave reviews. This inspired guitarist and blues harpist Cyril Davies and guitarist Alexis Korner to plug in and they began to play a high-powered electric blues that became the model for the subgenre, forming the band Blues Incorporated. Blues Incorporated was something of a clearing house for British blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s, with many joining, or sitting in on sessions. These included future Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones; Cream founders Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker; and Graham Bond and Long John Baldry. Blues Incorporated were given a residency at the Marquee Club and it was from there that in 1962 they took the name of the first British Blues album, &quot;R&amp;B from the Marquee&quot; for Decca, but split before its release. The model of British rhythm and blues was emulated by a number of bands including the Rolling Stones, the Animals, the Small Faces, and the Yardbirds.
The other key focus for British blues was around John Mayall who moved to London in the early 1960s, eventually forming the Bluesbreakers, whose members at various times included, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor. The &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton (Beano)&quot; album (1966) is considered one of the seminal British blues recordings. It was notable for its driving rhythms and Clapton&#x27;s rapid blues licks with a full distorted sound derived from a Gibson Les Paul and a Marshall amp, which became something of a classic combination for British blues (and later rock) guitarists. It also made clear the primacy of the guitar, seen as a distinctive characteristic of the subgenre. Clapton left to form Cream with Baker and Bruce and his replacement was Peter Green, who in turn (with the then Bluesbreaker&#x27;s rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie) left in 1967 to form Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac. Incorporating elements of rock led these bands to a hybrid form known as blues rock.

==Blues rock==

Blues rock combines blues with rock. With some notable exceptions, blues rock has largely been played by white musicians, bringing a rock sensitivity to blues standards and forms and it played a major role in widening the appeal of the blues to white American audiences. In 1963, American guitarist Lonnie Mack had developed a blues rock guitar style, releasing several guitar instrumentals, the best-known of which are the hit singles &quot;Memphis&quot; (Billboard #5) and &quot;Wham!&quot; (Billboard #24). The Paul Butterfield Blues Band and Canned Heat were among the earliest exponents and &quot;attempted to play long, involved improvisations which were commonplace on jazz records&quot;. In the UK, blues rock was popularized by bands as Fleetwood Mac, Free, Savoy Brown and the groups formed around the three major guitarists that emerged from the Yardbirds, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page.

After leaving the Yardbirds and his work with John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers, Eric Clapton formed supergroups Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominos, followed by a solo career. In the late 1960s Jeff Beck added elements heavy rock with his band, the Jeff Beck Group. Jimmy Page formed &quot;the New Yardbirds&quot;, which became Led Zeppelin. Many of the songs on their first two albums and occasionally later in their careers, were expansions on traditional blues songs. Janis Joplin, Johnny Winter, and The J. Geils Band later popularized the style in the US. The revolutionary electric guitar playing of Jimi Hendrix with the Experience and Band of Gypsys, influenced blues rock guitarists. Blues rock bands like Allman Brothers Band, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and eventually ZZ Top from the American South, incorporated country elements into their style to produce Southern rock.

By the 1970s, blues rock had become heavier and more riff-based, exemplified by the work of Led Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and the lines between blues rock and hard rock &quot;were barely visible&quot;, as bands began recording rock-style albums. The genre was continued in the 1970s by figures such as George Thorogood and Pat Travers. Except perhaps for groups such as Status Quo and Foghat in the UK, who moved towards a form of high energy and repetitive boogie rock, bands moved towards heavy metal and blues rock began to slip out of the mainstream. More recently, the White Stripes, the Black Crowes, the Black Keys, Clutch, the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, and Joe Bonamassa have explored a more roots oriented, but edgier style.

==Electric Texas blues==
Texas had had a long history of major acoustic blues performers like Blind Lemon Jefferson and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins, but by the 1940s many Texas blues artists had moved elsewhere to further their careers, including T-Bone Walker who relocated to Los Angeles to record his most influential records in the 1940s. His R&amp;B influenced backing and saxophone imitating lead guitar sound would become an influential part of the electric blues sound. Goree Carter&#x27;s &quot;Rock Awhile&quot; (1949) featured an over-driven electric guitar style and has been cited as a strong contender for the &quot;first rock and roll record&quot; title.

The state R&amp;B recording industry was based in Houston with labels like Duke/Peacock, which in the 1950s provided a base for artists who would later pursue the electric Texas blues sound, including Johnny Copeland and Albert Collins. Freddie King, a major influence on electric blues, was born in Texas, but moved to Chicago as a teenager. His instrumental number &quot;Hide Away&quot; (1961), was emulated by British blues artists including Eric Clapton.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s the Texas electric blues scene began to flourish, influenced by country music and blues rock, particularly in the clubs of Austin. The diverse style often featured instruments like keyboards and horns, but placed particular emphasis on powerful lead guitar breaks. The most prominent artists to emerge in this era were the brothers Johnny and Edgar Winter, who combined traditional and southern styles. In the 1970s Jimmie formed the Fabulous Thunderbirds and in the 1980s his brother Stevie Ray Vaughan broke through to mainstream success with his virtuoso guitar playing, as did ZZ Top with their brand of Southern rock.

==Contemporary electric blues==
Since the end of the 1960s, electric blues has declined in mainstream popularity, but retained a strong following in the US, Britain and elsewhere, with many musicians that began their careers as early as the 1950s continuing to record and perform, occasionally producing breakthrough stars. In the 1970s and 1980s, it absorbed a number of different influences, including particularly rock and soul music. Stevie Ray Vaughan was the biggest star influenced by blues rock and opened the way for guitarists including Kenny Wayne Shepherd and Jonny Lang. Practitioners of soul-influenced electric blues in the 1970s and 1980s included Joe Louis Walker and most successfully Robert Cray, whose &quot;Strong Persuader&quot; album (1986), with its fluid guitar sound and an intimate vocal style, produced a major crossover hit. Veteran Linsey Alexander is known for his original Chicago blues influenced by soul, R&amp;B, and funk.

Since her breakthrough commercial success &quot;Nick of Time&quot; (1989), Bonnie Raitt has been one of the leading artists in acoustic and electric blues, doing much to promote the profile of older blues artists. After the renewed success of John Lee Hooker with his collaborative album &quot;The Healer&quot; (1989), several artists began to return to electric blues, including Gary Moore, beginning with &quot;Still Got the Blues&quot; (1990) and Eric Clapton with &quot;From the Cradle&quot; (1994).

<text>Democrats 66 (; D66) is a social liberal and progressive political party in the Netherlands, which is positioned in the centre of the political spectrum. It is a member of the Liberal International (LI) and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE).

The name of the party refers to its year of foundation, 1966. Initially, its main objective had been to democratise the Dutch political system, but it developed a broader social liberal ideology over time. In the 1967 general election, the party won 7 out of 150 seats in the House of Representatives. No new party had ever gained that many seats before. The party was in government from 1973 to 1977, 1981 to 1982, 1994 to 2002, 2003 to 2006 and 2017 to 2024. It currently holds nine seats in the House of Representatives, five seats in the Senate and three seats in the European Parliament.

D66 is especially popular among people who hold a university degree, and its voters are mostly concentrated in larger cities and in municipalities with an above-average number of wealthy residents. The party supplies a relatively large proportion of mayors, who are appointed rather than elected.

Currently, the party is led by Rob Jetten, who was elected party leader on 12 August 2023. Paul van Meenen, Rob Jetten and Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy are serving as the party&#x27;s parliamentary leaders in the Senate, the House of Representatives and the European Parliament respectively.

== History ==
=== Early years (1966–1986) ===
Democrats 66 was founded on 14 October 1966 by a group of 44 people. Its founders were described as &quot;homines novi&quot;, although 25 of the 44 had previously been members of another political party. The initiators were Hans van Mierlo, a journalist for the &quot;Algemeen Handelsblad&quot;, and Hans Gruijters, a municipal councillor in Amsterdam for the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). Van Mierlo became the party&#x27;s political leader. The foundation of the party was preceded by the &quot;Appeal 1966&quot; on 10 October, in which the founders appealed to the people of the Netherlands to re-take their democratic institutions. The party renounced the 19th-century political ideologies, which dominated the political system and sought to end pillarisation. It called for radical democratisation of the Dutch political system, and for pragmatic and scientific policy-making.
The party participated in the 1967 general election, with Hans van Mierlo as its lead candidate. The party won an unprecedented seven seats in the House of Representatives. In the 1971 general election, the party won an additional four seats and it formed a shadow cabinet with the Labour Party (PvdA) and the Political Party of Radicals (PPR). In the 1972 general election, the three parties formed a political alliance called the &quot;Progressive Agreement&quot; (; PAK) and presented the common electoral program &quot;Turning Point &#x27;72&quot; (&quot;Keerpunt &#x27;72&quot;).

In the election, D66 lost nearly half its seats, leaving only six. The alliance became the largest political force in the country, but it did not gain a majority. After long cabinet formation talks, the three PAK-parties formed an extra-parliamentary cabinet joined by progressive members of the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP). The cabinet was led by Labour politician Joop den Uyl. Co-founder Hans Gruijters became Minister of Housing and Spatial Planning. After the formation talks, Van Mierlo left politics, feeling that his political position within the parliamentary party was untenable. Van Mierlo was replaced by Jan Terlouw, who became the new parliamentary leader.
In the period 1972–1974, the party lost a dramatic number of members (from 6,000 to 300) and polled very poorly in the 1974 provincial elections. The party also lost half of its senators in the 1974 Senate election. At one of the party congresses, a motion was put forth to abolish the party. A majority of the members voted in favour, but the two-thirds majority was not reached. In reaction, Terlouw started a campaign to revitalise the party, involving a membership drive and a petition to the electorate. He emphasised issues other than democratic reform and gave the party a more liberal orientation. The party doubled its membership in 1975 and won two additional seats in the 1977 general election, despite losing all its seats in the Senate in the same year.

In the 1981 general election, D66 gained 17 seats. The party formed a government with the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), with Terlouw as Minister of Economic Affairs. The cabinet was characterised by the personal and ideological conflicts between Prime Minister Dries van Agt (CDA) and Minister of Social Affairs Joop den Uyl (PvdA). The cabinet fell nine months after it was formed, when the Labour Party left the cabinet. D66 and the CDA continued to govern in a caretaker government. In the subsequent 1982 general election, D66 lost two-thirds of its support, and was left with only 6 seats. After the election, Terlouw left politics and was replaced by Maarten Engwirda. The party was confined to opposition.

=== Purple cabinets and demise (1986–2006) ===
In 1986, Van Mierlo returned to politics. He emphasised democratic reform as the core issue of the party and wanted to end the polarisation between the Labour Party and VVD, so that it would be possible to form a government without the CDA. He led the party in the 1986 general election and won nine seats. In the 1989 election, the party won 12 seats and was asked to join the formation talks of a CDA–PvdA–D66 coalition. While the PvdA preferred to form a government &quot;with&quot; D66, the CDA did not. Ultimately, D66 was excluded from the coalition, because it was not necessary to include them to reach a majority in parliament.

Despite being in opposition, D66 adopted a constructive approach towards the government. They were rewarded for this in the 1994 general election, in which the party doubled its number of seats to 24. D66 was able to form its preferred coalition: the &quot;purple government&quot;, which included both the social democratic PvdA and the conservative liberal VVD. Van Mierlo was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. As advocated by D66, the first Kok cabinet initiated progressive legislation, such as the introduction of same-sex marriage and the legalisation of euthanasia. The moderately liberal economic policies of the cabinet were also seen as a great success.
Shortly before the 1998 general election, Van Mierlo stepped back and Minister of Health Els Borst became the new top candidate. D66 lost ten seats in the election, while its coalition partners gained ground at the cost of D66. The second Kok cabinet continued. Although D66 was technically not needed for a majority in parliament, it was seen as the glue that kept the PvdA and the VVD together. Borst stepped down as party leader and became Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Health. Thom de Graaf led the party in the House of Representatives. From within the party, there were calls for a more explicit progressive liberal course. In 1999, a constitutional reform that would allow for referendums to be held was rejected by the Senate, because a group of VVD dissidents had voted against it. In response, D66 left the cabinet. After the subsequent formation talks, D66 returned to the cabinet in return for a temporary referendum law and directly elected mayors.

In the 2002 general election, the tide had turned against the purple government, and the right-wing populist Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) gained considerable ground. The three purple parties lost an unprecedented 43 seats. D66 was left with only seven seats. The first Balkenende cabinet, consisting of CDA, LPF and VVD, lasted only three months. In the 2003 general election, D66 lost another seat, leaving only 6. De Graaf stepped down and was succeeded by Boris Dittrich. After long formation talks between the CDA and the PvdA failed, a second Balkenende cabinet was formed, which included the CDA, the VVD and D66.

In return for investments in environment and education, and a special Minister for Governmental Reform, D66 supported the centre-right reform cabinet and some of its more controversial legislation. In May 2005, the Senate rejected a constitutional reform that would allow a directly elected mayor. The legislation had been introduced by the second Kok cabinet, but it was unable to get a two-thirds majority because the Labour Party was opposed the electoral system proposed by Minister for Governmental Reform Thom de Graaf. De Graaf resigned, but the rest of the ministers retained their positions as D66 was promised more investment in public education and the environment. A special party congress was called to ratify this so-called &quot;Easter Agreement&quot; (&quot;Paasakkoord&quot;). 2,600 members (20 per cent of total membership) were present and the congress was broadcast live on television. The congress agreed to remain in cabinet by a large majority. Alexander Pechtold replaced De Graaf as Minister for Governmental Reform. Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, the Minister of Economic Affairs, became Deputy Prime Minister.

=== Pechtold leadership (2006–2016) ===
In February 2006, Dittrich stepped down as parliamentary leader, because he did not agree with the government&#x27;s decision to send the Dutch armed forces to the southern province of Uruzgan in Afghanistan. D66 voted against the government&#x27;s proposal together with the Socialist Party and GroenLinks. Dittrich stated that the mission to send troops was not a reconstruction mission (as the government and the majority of the Dutch parliament claimed), but a military operation. Lousewies van der Laan replaced Dittrich. In May 2006, D66 polled particularly badly in the 2006 municipal elections. D66 began to lose a considerable number of members, some of whom founded deZES, another radical democratic, progressive liberal party. During a special party congress on 13 May 2006, a motion was put forth demanding the withdrawal of D66 from the cabinet, but it was rejected. In June 2006, an internal election was held in order to choose the new party leader. The election was won by Alexander Pechtold.

During the special parliamentary debate on the naturalisation process of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, D66 supported a motion of no confidence against Minister for Integration Rita Verdonk. As D66 was a junior coalition partner, this caused a crisis in the second Balkenende cabinet. The cabinet refused to remove Verdonk from her position. Lousewies van der Laan, parliamentary leader of D66, felt that the D66 faction could no longer support the cabinet and stated that the cabinet had to resign. On 3 July 2006, the two D66 ministers Alexander Pechtold and Laurens Jan Brinkhorst resigned, causing the second Balkenende cabinet to fall.

In October 2006, just before the D66 party congress and its 40th anniversary as a party, D66 founder Hans van Mierlo asked the question whether D66 still had political legitimacy. He believed that many errors were made in recent history and that only the acceptance of these errors could provide for any credibility for D66. Van Mierlo declared his support for party leader Pechtold, who in his view could provide for such credibility.
Since 2008, the party has performed quite well in the opinion polls, ranging from 10 to 26 seats, compared to only 3 seats in the House of Representatives. In the 2009 European Parliament election, the party won 11% of the votes and 3 seats, two more than in the previous election. The news programme Nova attributed this increase to the leadership of Alexander Pechtold, who was considered &quot;the leader of the opposition&quot; at the time. Under the leadership of Pechtold, the party has taken strong stances against the Party for Freedom (PVV) of Geert Wilders. In the 2010 general election, D66 increased its representation to 10 seats. In the 2012 general election, the party further increased its number of seats to 12. Since 2008, the party has experienced a significant increase in party membership, from 10,000 to 25,000 in 2015.

In the 2017 general election, D66 won 19 seats in the House of Representatives and formed a centre-right coalition government with the VVD, CDA and Christian Union (CU). Kajsa Ollongren was appointed second Deputy Prime Minister in the third Rutte cabinet.

=== Kaag and Jetten leadership (2018–present) ===
In October 2018, Alexander Pechtold announced his retirement from politics. He was replaced by Rob Jetten as parliamentary leader, but the position of party leader remained vacant. In September 2020, Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Sigrid Kaag was elected the new party leader and top candidate for the 2021 general election. Despite the fact that the opinion polls had predicted D66 to lose seats, the party won 24 seats in the 2021 election, becoming the second largest party in the House of Representatives. On 12 August 2023 Rob Jetten became the leader of the party. Following the 2023 Dutch general election D66 lost more seats than any party, being reduced from 24 to 9, their worst result in 17 years.

== Ideology ==
The ideology of D66 is a highly contested subject within the party and the question is tied to the reason for its existence. There are two currents within the party, namely the radical democrats and the progressive liberals. Although sometimes antagonistic, these two currents currently complement each other as both emphasise the self-realisation of the individual. The Radical League and the Free-thinking Democratic League, two early 20th century parties are historic exponents of these two traditions.

=== Factions ===

==== Radical democrats ====
The first party congress emphasised radical democratisation of Dutch society and the political system. Its ideal was a two-party system. To obtain this, it wanted to reform the electoral system after the American first past the post model. The electoral reform was gradually moderated as the party now favours German-style mixed member proportional representation. In this system, a national party-list election is used to make a first-past-the-post election representative to the nationwide vote. This radical democratisation was combined with a pragmatic and anti-dogmatic attitude towards politics. Hans van Mierlo, the party&#x27;s leader between 1966 and 1972 and between 1986 and 1998 and the party&#x27;s figurehead, was an important exponent of this tendency within the party.

==== Progressive liberals ====
D66&#x27;s progressive liberal section has historically been much weaker than its radical democratic wing. Under Jan Terlouw between 1972 and 1982, D66 began to emphasise new issues like the environment, public education and innovation. He called D66 a fourth current, next to social democracy, Christian democracy and the conservative liberalism of the VVD. In 1998, the group Opschudding called for a progressive liberal course for the party. In the party&#x27;s manifesto adopted in 2000, the party explicitly adopted a progressive liberal image. National political reasons explain the usage of the label &quot;social-liberal&quot; since the more right-leaning VVD describes itself as the liberal party.

=== Positions ===
Some of the party&#x27;s most important positions include:
* D66 is in favour of a mixed economy combining market economics and government intervention. D66 is also a proponent of increased flexibility in the labour market and tax cuts for the lower and middle classes.
* D66 proposes to increase government spending on education and innovation, for instance increases in teachers&#x27; salaries. D66 wants the education sector to be deregulated and introduce more competition in the sector.
* The environment is an important issue for the party. D66 favours a carbon price and more investment in sustainable energy to combat global warming. It opposes the right to hunt and sees hunting only as last resort for wildlife damage control.
* D66 is a socially liberal party. The first Kok cabinet in which it participated introduced several liberal reforms in the past, such as the legalisation of euthanasia, same-sex marriage and prostitution.
* D66 is a proponent of democratic reform. It favours electoral reforms such as a binding referendum, abolition of the Senate and direct election of prime ministers and mayors.
* D66 favours a Federal Europe and more European cooperation on issues such as the environment, immigration policy and foreign policy.

== Electorate ==
Although supporters of political parties are no longer fixed and election results fluctuate, D66 is overall strong and concentrated in the Randstad conurbation, while also getting its votes in and around university towns. In the 2014 municipal elections, D66 became the largest party in many major cities including Amsterdam, The Hague, Utrecht, Tilburg, Groningen, Enschede, Apeldoorn, Haarlem, Amersfoort and Arnhem.

=== Name and logo ===
At its foundation, the party was called Democrats &#x27;66 (, abbreviated D&#x27;66). The name referred to the party&#x27;s goal of radical democratisation and to the year of foundation, which was supposed to convey a modern image. In 1981, the apostrophe was dropped: the name had become a successful political brand, but the year no longer conveyed a modern image.

=== Structure ===
The highest organ of the D66 is the General Assembly, in which every member can participate. It convenes multiple times per year. It appoints the party board and has the last say over the party program. The party list, including the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader, for the Senate, House of Representatives, European Parliament candidates are elected directly by the members. The party has between 250 and 300 branches all over the Netherlands.

D66 is a co-founder of the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties. The Hans van Mierlo Foundation is the party&#x27;s policy institute.

=== International affiliation ===
D66 is a member of the Liberal International and of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). D66 joined the Liberal and Democratic Reformists (LDR) group in 1989. It became a full member of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR) in 1994 and a full member of the Liberal International in 1986.

==== European Parliament ====
The D66 delegation is part of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament. Prior to the first European elections in 1979, D66&#x27;s appointed MEPs were part of the Socialist Group, before switching to Non-Inscrits from 1979 to 1984, and the LDR/ELDR/ALDE group since 1989.

Current members of the European Parliament since the 2024 European Parliament election:

* Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, delegation leader
* Raquel Garcia Hermida-van der Walle
* Brigitte van den Berg

==== Committee of the Regions ====
In the European Committee of the Regions, the Democrats 66 party sits in the Renew Europe CoR group, with one full and one alternate member for the 2020–2025 mandate:
* Robert van Asten (alternate)
* Ellen van Selm (member)

=== Water board ===
D66 does not run an independent list for the water board elections. Instead, like GroenLinks and Volt Netherlands, it recommends that its voters support Water Natuurlijk, an independent, green-oriented political party focused solely on water board elections.

<text>British blues is a form of music derived from American blues that originated in the late 1950s, and reached its height of mainstream popularity in the 1960s. In Britain, blues developed a distinctive and influential style dominated by electric guitar, and made international stars of several proponents of the genre, including the Rolling Stones, the Animals, the Yardbirds, John Mayall, Eric Clapton, Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin.

==Origins==

American blues became known in Britain from the 1930s onwards through a number of routes, including records brought to Britain, particularly by African-American GIs stationed there in the Second World War and Cold War, merchant seamen visiting ports such as London, Liverpool, Newcastle upon Tyne and Belfast, and through a trickle of (illegal) imports. Blues music was relatively well known to British jazz musicians and fans, particularly in the works of figures like female singers Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith and the blues-influenced boogie-woogie of Jelly Roll Morton and Fats Waller. From 1955 major British record labels HMV and EMI, the latter, particularly through their subsidiary Decca Records, began to distribute American jazz and increasingly blues records to what was an emerging market. Many encountered blues for the first time through the skiffle craze of the second half of the 1950s, particularly the songs of Lead Belly covered by acts like Lonnie Donegan. As skiffle began to decline in the late 1950s, and British rock and roll began to dominate the charts, a number of skiffle musicians moved towards playing purely blues music.

Among these were guitarist and blues harpist Cyril Davies, who ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse public house in London&#x27;s Soho, and guitarist Alexis Korner, both of whom worked for jazz band leader Chris Barber, playing in the R&amp;B segment he introduced to his show. The club served as a focal point for British skiffle acts and Barber was responsible for bringing over American folk and blues performers, who found they were much better known and paid in Europe than America. The first major artist was Big Bill Broonzy, who visited England in the mid-1950s, but who, rather than his electric Chicago blues, played a folk blues set to fit in with British expectations of American blues as a form of folk music. In 1957 Davies and Korner decided that their central interest was the blues and closed the skiffle club, reopening a month later in the Roundhouse pub, Wardour Street, Soho as the London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. To this point British blues was acoustically played emulating Delta blues and Country blues styles and often part of the emerging second British folk revival. Critical in changing this was the visit of Muddy Waters in 1958, who initially shocked British audiences by playing amplified electric blues, but who was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and rave reviews. 

Davies and Korner, having already split with Barber, now plugged in and began to play high-powered electric blues that became the model for the subgenre, forming the band Blues Incorporated. In early 1962, having been ejected from the Roundhouse for being too loud, Korner and Davies moved their club to the venue used by Ealing Jazz Club and on 17 March opened the UK&#x27;s first regular UK blues night.

Blues Incorporated became something of a clearing house for British blues musicians in the later 1950s and early 1960s, with many joining, or sitting in on sessions. These included future Rolling Stones, Keith Richards, Mick Jagger, Charlie Watts and Brian Jones; as well as Cream founders Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker; beside Graham Bond and Long John Baldry. After their success at the Ealing Club, Blues Incorporated were given a residency at the Marquee Club and it was from there that in 1962 they took the name of the first British Blues album, &quot;R&amp;B from the Marquee&quot; for Decca, but split before its release. The culmination of this first movement of blues came with John Mayall, who moved to London in the early 1960s, eventually forming the Bluesbreakers, whose members at various times included, Jack Bruce, Aynsley Dunbar, Eric Clapton, Peter Green and Mick Taylor.

==British rhythm and blues==
While some bands focused on blues artists, particularly those of Chicago electric blues, others adopted a wider interest in rhythm and blues, including the work of Chess Records&#x27; blues artists like Muddy Waters and Howlin&#x27; Wolf, but also rock and roll pioneers Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley. Most successful were the Rolling Stones, who abandoned blues purism before their line-up solidified and they produced their first eponymously titled album in 1964, which largely consisted of rhythm and blues standards. Following in the wake of the Beatles&#x27; national and then international success, the Rolling Stones soon established themselves as the second most popular UK band and joined the British Invasion of the American record charts as leaders of a second wave of R&amp;B orientated bands. In addition to Chicago blues numbers, the Rolling Stones covered songs by Chuck Berry and the Valentinos, with the latter&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Now&quot; giving them their first UK number one in 1964. Blues songs and influences continued to surface in the Rolling Stones&#x27; music, as in their version of &quot;Little Red Rooster&quot;, which went to number 1 on the UK singles chart in December 1964.

Other London-based bands included the Yardbirds (whose ranks included three key guitarists in Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page), The Kinks (with pioneer songwriter Ray Davies and rock-guitarist Dave Davies), and Manfred Mann (considered to have one of the most authentic sounding vocalists in the scene in Paul Jones) and the Pretty Things, beside the more jazz-influenced acts like the Graham Bond Organisation, Georgie Fame and Zoot Money. Bands to emerge from other major British cities included the Animals from Newcastle (with the keyboards of Alan Price and vocals of Eric Burdon), the Moody Blues and Spencer Davis Group from Birmingham (the latter largely a vehicle for the young Steve Winwood), and Them from Belfast (with their vocalist Van Morrison). None of these bands played exclusively rhythm and blues, often relying on a variety of sources, including Brill Building and girl group songs for their hit singles, but it remained at the core of their early albums.
The British Mod subculture was musically centred on rhythm and blues and later soul music, performed by artists that were not available in small London clubs around which the scene was based. As a result, a number of mod bands emerged to fill this gap. These included the Small Faces, The Creation, the Action and, most successfully, the Who. The Who&#x27;s early promotional material tagged them as producing &quot;maximum rhythm and blues&quot;, but by about 1966 they moved from attempting to emulate American R&amp;B to producing songs that reflected the Mod lifestyle. Many of these bands were able to enjoy cult and then national success in the UK, but found it difficult to break into the American market. Only the Who managed, after some difficulty, to produce a significant US following, particularly after their appearances at the Monterey Pop Festival (1967) and Woodstock (1969).

Because of the very different circumstances from which they came, and in which they played, the rhythm and blues these bands produced was very different in tone from that of African American artists, often with more emphasis on guitars and sometimes with greater energy. They have been criticised for exploiting the massive catalogue of African American music, but it has also been noted that they both popularised that music, bringing it to British, world and in some cases American audiences, and helping to build the reputation of existing and past rhythm and blues artists. Most of these bands rapidly moved on from recording and performing American standards to writing and recording their own music, often leaving their R&amp;B roots behind, but enabling several to enjoy sustained careers that were not open to most of the more pop-oriented beat groups of the first wave of the invasion, who (with the major exception of the Beatles) were unable to write their own material or adapt to changes in the musical climate.

==British blues boom==

The blues boom overlapped, both chronologically and in terms of personnel, with the earlier, wider rhythm and blues phase, which had begun to peter out in the mid-1960s leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques, which they would carry into the pursuit of more purist blues interests. Blues Incorporated and Mayall&#x27;s Bluesbreakers were well known in the London jazz and emerging R&amp;B circuits, but the Bluesbreakers began to gain some national and international attention, particularly after the release of &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings. Produced by Mike Vernon, who later set up the Blue Horizon record label, it was notable for its driving rhythms and Clapton&#x27;s rapid blues licks with a full distorted sound derived from a Gibson Les Paul and a Marshall amp. This sound became something of a classic combination for British blues (and later rock) guitarists, and also made clear the primacy of the guitar, seen as a distinctive characteristic of the subgenre. Clapton stated, &quot;I spent most of my teens and early twenties studying the blues—the geography of it and the chronology of it, as well as how to play it&quot;. Peter Green started what is called &quot;second great epoch of British blues&quot;, as he replaced Clapton in the Bluesbreakers after his departure to form Cream. In 1967, after one record with the Bluesbreakers, Green, with the Bluesbreaker&#x27;s rhythm section Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, formed Peter Green&#x27;s Fleetwood Mac, produced by Mike Vernon on the Blue Horizon label. One key factor in developing the popularity of the music in the UK and across Europe in the early 1960s was the success of the American Folk Blues Festival tours, organised by German promoters Horst Lippmann and Fritz Rau.

The rise of electric blues, and its eventual mainstream success, meant that British acoustic blues was completely overshadowed. In the early 1960s, folk guitar pioneers Bert Jansch, John Renbourn and particularly Davy Graham (who played and recorded with Korner), played blues, folk and jazz, developing a distinctive guitar style known as folk baroque. British acoustic blues continued to develop as part of the folk scene, with figures like Ian A. Anderson and his Country Blues Band, and Al Jones. Most British acoustic blues players could achieve little commercial success and, with a few exceptions, found it difficult to gain any recognition for their &quot;imitations&quot; of the blues in the US.
In contrast, the next wave of bands, formed from about 1967, like Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Ten Years After, Savoy Brown, and Free, pursued a different route, retaining blues standards in their repertoire and producing original material that often shied away from obvious pop influences, placing an emphasis on individual virtuosity. The result has been characterised as blues rock and arguably marked the beginnings of a separation of pop and rock music that was to be a feature of the record industry for several decades. Cream is often seen as the first supergroup, combining the talents of Clapton, Bruce and Baker; they have also been seen as one of the first groups to exploit the power trio. Although only together for a little over two years in 1966–1969, they were highly influential and it was in this period that Clapton became an international superstar. Fleetwood Mac are often considered to have produced some of the finest work in the subgenre, with inventive interpretations of Chicago blues. They were also the most commercially successful group, with their eponymous début album reaching the UK top five in early 1968 and as the instrumental &quot;Albatross&quot; reached number one in the single charts in early 1969. This was, as Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz put it, &quot;The commercial apex of the British blues Boom&quot;. Free, with the guitar talents of Paul Kossoff, particularly from their self titled second album (1969), produced a stripped down form of blues that would be highly influential on hard rock and later heavy metal. Ten Years After, with guitarist Alvin Lee, formed in 1967, but achieved their breakthrough in 1968 with their live album &quot;Undead&quot; and in the US with their appearance at Woodstock the next year. Among the last British blues bands to gain mainstream success were Jethro Tull, formed from the amalgamation of two blues bands, the John Evan Band and the Mcgregor&#x27;s Engine in 1967. Their second album, &quot;Stand Up&quot;, reached number one in the UK in 1969.

==Decline==

British blues entered a rapid decline at the end of 1960s. Surviving bands and musicians tended to move into other expanding areas of rock music. Some, like Jethro Tull, followed bands like the Moody Blues away from 12-bar structures and harmonicas into complex, classical-influenced progressive rock. Some played a loud version of blues rock that became the foundation for hard rock and heavy metal. Led Zeppelin, formed by Yardbirds guitarist Jimmy Page, on their first two albums, both released in 1969, fused heavy blues and amplified rock to create what has been seen as a watershed in the development of hard rock and nascent heavy metal. Later recordings would mix in elements of folk and mysticism, which would also be a major influence on heavy metal music. Deep Purple developed a sound based on &quot;squeezing and stretching&quot; the blues, and achieved their commercial breakthrough with their fourth and distinctively heavier album, &quot;Deep Purple in Rock&quot; (1970), which has been seen as one of heavy metal&#x27;s defining albums. Black Sabbath was the third incarnation of a group that started as the Polka Tulk Blues Band in 1968. Their early work included blues standards, but by the time of their second album &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970), they had added elements of modality and the occult that would largely define modern heavy metal. Some, like Korner and Mayall, continued to play a &quot;pure&quot; form of the blues, but largely outside of mainstream notice. The structure of clubs, venues and festivals that had grown up in the early 1950s in Britain virtually disappeared in the 1970s.

==Survival and resurgence==

Although overshadowed by the growth of rock music the blues did not disappear in Britain, with American bluesmen such as John Lee Hooker, Eddie Taylor, and Freddie King continuing to be well received in the UK and an active home scene led by figures including Dave Kelly and his sister Jo Ann Kelly, who helped keep the acoustic blues alive on the British folk circuit. Dave Kelly was also a founder of The Blues Band with former Manfred Mann members Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness, Hughie Flint and Gary Fletcher. The Blues Band was credited with kicking off a second blues boom in Britain, which by the 1990s led to festivals all around the country, including The Swanage Blues Festival, The Burnley National Blues Festival, The Gloucester Blues and Heritage Festival and The Great British Rhythm and Blues Festival at Colne. The twenty-first century has seen an upsurge in interest in the blues in Britain that can be seen in the success of previously unknown acts including Seasick Steve, in the return to the blues by major figures who began in the first boom, including Peter Green, Mick Fleetwood, Chris Rea and Eric Clapton, as well as the arrival of new artists such as Dani Wilde, Matt Schofield, Aynsley Lister and most recently in 2017 the Starlite Campbell Band.
The British blues tradition lives on, as a style, outside of Britain as well. American guitarist Joe Bonamassa describes his main influences as the 1960s era British blues players, and considers himself a part of that tradition rather than the earlier American blues styles.

==Significance==
Beside giving a start to many important blues, pop and rock musicians, in spawning blues rock British blues also ultimately gave rise to a host of subgenres of rock, including particularly psychedelic rock, progressive rock, hard rock and ultimately heavy metal. Perhaps the most important contribution of British blues was the surprising re-exportation of American blues back to America, where, in the wake of the success of bands like the Rolling Stones and Fleetwood Mac, white audiences began to look again at black blues musicians like Muddy Waters, Howlin&#x27; Wolf and John Lee Hooker, who suddenly began to appeal to middle class white Americans. The result was a re-evaluation of the blues in America which enabled white Americans much more easily to become blues musicians, opening the door to Southern rock and the development of Texas blues musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

<text>Dream pop (also typeset as dreampop) is a subgenre of alternative rock and neo-psychedelia that emphasizes atmosphere and sonic texture as much as pop melody. Common characteristics include breathy vocals, dense productions, and effects such as reverb, echo, tremolo, and chorus. It often overlaps with the related genre of shoegaze, and the two genre terms have at times been used interchangeably.

The genre came into prominence in the 1980s through groups associated with the UK label 4AD, most prominently Cocteau Twins, This Mortal Coil, and A.R. Kane. Subsequently, UK-based acts such as My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, and Lush alongside US-based artists Galaxie 500, Julee Cruise, and Mazzy Star released significant albums in the style. It saw renewed popularity among millennial listeners following the late-2000s success of acts such as Beach House and Men I Trust.

==Characteristics==

The term dream pop is thought to relate to the &quot;immersion&quot; in the music experienced by the listener. &quot;The AllMusic Guide to Electronica&quot; (2003) defined dream pop as &quot;an atmospheric subgenre of alternative rock that relies on sonic textures as much as melody&quot;. According to &quot;Paste&quot;, the genre emphasizes mood and sonics over lyrics, so that &quot;chords and tracks blur seamlessly into one another so frequently that it can be difficult to even decipher when one song ended and another has begun.&quot; Common characteristics are breathy vocals, the use of guitar effects, and a densely produced sound, with &quot;nebulous, distorted guitars&quot; paired with &quot;murmured vocals sometimes completely smudged into a wall of noise.&quot; The music tends to focus on textures rather than propulsive rock riffs. Effects such as reverb and echo are ubiquitous, with tremolo and chorus also heard on recordings.

Lyrics are often introspective or existential in nature, but may be difficult to hear or incomprehensible in the mix. In the view of critic Simon Reynolds, dream pop &quot;celebrates rapturous and transcendent experiences, often using druggy and mystical imagery&quot;. In 1991, he suggested this escapist tendency might be a response to the cultural landscape of the UK during the 1980s: &quot;After 12 years of Conservative government in Britain, any idealism or constructive political involvement seems futile to these alienated middle-class dropouts.&quot; Similarly, according to Rachel Felder, dream pop artists often resist representations of social reality in favour of ambiguous or hallucinogenic experiences.

==History==
===1960s–1970s: Origins===
Author Nathan Wiseman-Trowse writes that the &quot;approach to the sheer physicality of sound&quot; integral to dream pop was &quot;arguably pioneered in popular music by figures such as Phil Spector and (Beach Boys founder) Brian Wilson.&quot; The Beach Boys recorded an early dream pop song, &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot;, for their 1970 album &quot;Sunflower&quot;. Critic Jim Allen, who cites the Beach Boys as the &quot;godfathers&quot; of the style, says that the song&#x27;s unprecedented &quot;cinematic dream sequence&quot; production style marks the point &quot;where the dream pop family tree starts to come into focus.&quot; However, the Beach Boys&#x27; impact on the genre was not widely acknowledged until after the 2000s. 

The 1960s work of the Byrds would influence the &quot;swoony harmonies&quot; of later British dream pop groups. The music of the Velvet Underground in the 1960s and 1970s, which experimented with repetition, tone and texture over conventional song structure, was also an important touchstone in the genre&#x27;s development. Their 1967 debut &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; incorporated what music critic Marc Beamount terms &quot;psychedelic dream pop&quot; in addition to a variety of other styles. Elements of dream pop could also be found in Velvet Underground songs such as &quot;Candy Says&quot; (1969).

Music journalist John Bergstrom recognises George Harrison&#x27;s 1970 track &quot;Let It Down&quot; as a progenitor of the genre, while stating that its Spector-produced parent album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; influenced &quot;many guitar-driven, echo-drenched bands have come around since, mixing powerful rave-ups with moody, reflective down-tempo numbers and a spiritual bent.

=== Early–mid 1980s: Development ===

A.J. Ramirez of &quot;PopMatters&quot; recognises an evolutionary line from gothic rock to dream pop. The early 1980s gothic-derived &quot;ethereal wave&quot; subgenre, with its effects-laden guitar sounds and female vocals, led to the dream pop and shoegaze scenes; it was represented by Cocteau Twins and labels such as 4AD and Projekt Records. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; describes &quot;modern dream pop&quot; as originating with the early 1980s work of Cocteau Twins and their contemporaries. AllMusic&#x27;s Jason Ankeny credits the Cocteau Twins&#x27; &quot;distinctly ethereal&quot; sound and singer Elizabeth Fraser&#x27;s operatic, indecipherable vocals with defining their label, the UK-based 4AD. According to &quot;Paste&quot;, the band crystallized their &quot;swelling, euphoric&quot; dream pop sound on the 1984 album &quot;Treasure&quot;, with guitarist Robin Guthrie conjuring an array of &quot;woozy textures from his arsenal of effects pedals.&quot;

The 1984 album &quot;It&#x27;ll End in Tears&quot; by 4AD&#x27;s &quot;dream-pop supergroup&quot; This Mortal Coil was conceived by label head Ivo Watts-Russell and featured members of Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance. The album helped &quot;set the template for dream pop&quot; and associated the formerly gothic-affiliated UK label with the style. The album&#x27;s 1983 single, the Tim Buckley cover &quot;Song to the Siren&quot;, became an influential work in the genre, and saw success in the UK Indie Chart, remaining there consistently for two years. Other early acts to touch on the style included Lori and the Chameleons, Dif Juz, and the Durutti Column. According to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Vini Reilly of the Durutti Column &quot;embodied the cliché of the suicidal dream-pop guitarist in the mid-1980s&quot; with his &quot;narcotic performances&quot; presaging later acts such as My Bloody Valentine and Galaxie 500. The Dif Juz album &quot;Extractions&quot; (1985) would expand the dream pop sound, incorporating saxophone, shifting tonalities, and off-kilter rhythms.

Film director David Lynch, unable to obtain the rights to This Mortal Coil&#x27;s version of &quot;Song to the Siren&quot; for his 1986 film &quot;Blue Velvet&quot;, enlisted composer Angelo Badalamenti and singer Julee Cruise to record a replacement track. The result was &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot;, described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a significant development of the dream pop sound which &quot;gave the genre its synthy sheen&quot;. The trio of Cruise, Lynch and Badalamenti later recorded the 1989 album &quot;Floating into the Night&quot;, which further elaborated on the style and featured the &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; theme and UK top 10 single &quot;Falling&quot;.

===Late 1980s–1990s: Shoegaze scene===

The term &quot;dreampop&quot; was coined in the late 1980s by Alex Ayuli of A.R. Kane to describe his band&#x27;s eclectic sound, which blended effects-laden guitar with dub production and drum machine backing, among other elements. The group released their 1987 EP &quot;Lollita&quot; on 4AD, with production by Cocteau Twins guitarist Robin Guthrie. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; describes their debut album &quot;Sixty Nine&quot; (1988) as a &quot;crucial document&quot; of the dream pop movement, commenting that the group &quot;aimed to emulate an ethereality that could just as easily become nightmarish&quot;, resulting in music that feels &quot;just out of reach.&quot; Their &quot;dreampop&quot; label was subsequently adopted by music critic Simon Reynolds to describe that group and later extended to the nascent shoegazing scene in the UK. Reynolds describes the movement as &quot;a wave of hazy neo-psychedelic groups&quot; characterised by a &quot;blurry, blissful sound&quot;, and credits the influence of the &quot;ethereal soundscapes&quot; of Cocteau Twins as well as more distorted styles of American alternative rock.

In the 1990s, &quot;dream pop&quot; and &quot;shoegazing&quot; were interchangeable and regionally dependent terms, with &quot;dream pop&quot; being the name by which &quot;shoegazing&quot; was typically known in America. AllMusic describes the dream pop label as covering both the &quot;loud, shimmering feedback&quot; of My Bloody Valentine and the &quot;post-Velvet Underground guitar rock&quot; of Galaxie 500. My Bloody Valentine showcased a unique dream pop sound on their 1988 debut album &quot;Isn&#x27;t Anything&quot;, with guitarist Kevin Shields employing a tremolo-arm technique in order to produce &quot;an amorphous drone, at once visceral and disembodied&quot;. Galaxie 500 provided a &quot;cornerstone&quot; of the genre in their 1989 album &quot;On Fire&quot;, with their downtempo, reverb-laden sound becoming influential. UK bands acts as A.R. Kane, My Bloody Valentine and Ride played an influential role in the development of the movement. Other prominent acts to emerge from the movement include Slowdive and Chapterhouse.

The 1990 Cocteau Twins album &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; proved an iconic release in the genre. &quot;Spin&quot; credited My Bloody Valentine&#x27;s &quot;landmark&quot; 1991 album &quot;Loveless&quot; with &quot;crystalizing (and obliterating) the genres of dream pop and shoegaze guitar rock.&quot; The UK band Lush became an influential act in the genre during the 1990s, with Robin Guthrie producing their 1992 debut album &quot;Spooky&quot;. The 1993 album &quot;So Tonight That I Might See&quot; by American band Mazzy Star reflected a dream pop sound specific to &quot;the glitzy decay that is L.A.&quot;, according to &quot;Pitchfork&quot;; that publication called the album a &quot;dream pop classic&quot;. The late 1980s dream pop of A.R. Kane and My Bloody Valentine influenced 1990s acts such as Seefeel and Insides, who began incorporating elements such as samples and sequenced rhythms. Ambient pop music is described by AllMusic as &quot;essentially an extension of the dream pop that emerged in the wake of the shoegazer movement&quot;, distinct for its incorporation of electronic textures and techniques such as sampling. Bowery Electric&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Beat&quot; was described by &quot;Long Live Vinyl&quot; as an important touchstone of both dream pop and trip hop.

===2000s: Contemporary developments===
The 2007 album &quot;Person Pitch&quot; by Panda Bear combined Beach Boys-influenced dream pop with modern sampledelic techniques, winning acclaim and exerting a wide influence.
Much of the music associated with the 2009-coined term &quot;chillwave&quot; could be considered dream pop. The 2010 album &quot;Teen Dream&quot; by Baltimore duo Beach House established the group as purveyors of modern dream pop that drew on the &quot;languid reveries&quot; of Cocteau Twins, Mazzy Star and Galaxie 500. The group&#x27;s success in the late 2000s solidified the popularity of dream pop with millennial listeners.

<text>Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that originates from the 1986 &quot;NME&quot; compilation &quot;C86&quot;. Twee pop gets its name from the aesthetic of twee, which is known for its simplicity and childlike innocence. Some of its defining features are boy-girl harmonies, catchy melodies, and lyrics about love. For many years, prominent independent record labels associated with twee pop were Sarah Records (in the UK) and K Records (in the US).

Twee pop gained popularity in the 1990s, and has seen a recent revival in the 2020s.

==Etymology==

The definition of twee is something &quot;excessively or affectedly quaint, pretty, or sentimental,&quot; supposedly born from a childish mispronunciation of the word sweet. With the twee movement&#x27;s embrace of innocence and femininity, the genre has strong associations with feminism.

==Characteristics==
According to NPR, twee pop &quot;was fervently informed by punk: snappy riffs, fast-track tempos, propulsive drums.&quot; Artists such as Heavenly, Talulah Gosh, and Marine Girls were primarily women who wrote about love, relationships, and personal empowerment. While the music sounded lighthearted and naive, the subject matter was often gritty and dark. Twee pop has been seen as a feminist response to tough, invulnerable, masculine punk and post-punk music scenes of the time.
Many twee artists, such as Blueboy, were openly queer. In the 1990s, Indiepop and twee scenes rejected the sexist, homophobic, and racist attitudes of mainstream music. 

A retrospective fascination with the genre in the US saw Americans eagerly defining themselves as twee. According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Paula Mejia:

AllMusic says that twee pop is &quot;perhaps best likened to bubblegum indie rock—it&#x27;s music with a spirit of D.I.Y. defiance in the grand tradition of punk, but with a simplicity and innocence not seen or heard since the earliest days of rock &amp; roll&quot;. The author Marc Spitz suggests that the roots of twee stem from post-war 1950s music. While the culture categorized itself under the moniker of &quot;indie&quot; (short for independent), many major twee powerhouses gained mainstream critical acclaim for their contributions to the twee movement.

<text>A breve ( , less often , neuter form of the Latin &quot;short, brief&quot;) is the diacritic mark , shaped like the bottom half of a circle. As used in Ancient Greek, it is also called , . It resembles the caron (, the wedge or in Czech, in Slovak) but is rounded, in contrast to the angular tip of the caron. In many forms of Latin, is used for a shorter, softer variant of a vowel, such as &quot;Ĭ&quot;, where the sound is nearly identical to the English /i/. (See: )
== Length ==
The breve sign indicates a short vowel, as opposed to the macron (), which indicates long vowels, in academic transcription. It is often used that way in dictionaries and textbooks of Latin, Ancient Greek, Tuareg and other languages. However, there is a frequent convention of indicating only the long vowels. It is then understood that a vowel with no macron is short. If the vowel length is unknown, a breve as well as a macron are used in historical linguistics (Ā̆ ā̆ Ē̆ ē̆ Ī̆ ī̆ Ō̆ ō̆ Ū̆ ū̆ Ȳ̆ ȳ̆).
In Cyrillic script, a breve is used for &quot;Й&quot;. In Belarusian, it is used for both the Cyrillic &quot;Ў&quot; (semivowel U) and in the Latin (Łacinka) &quot;Ŭ&quot;. &quot;Ў&quot; was also used in Cyrillic Uzbek under the Soviet Union. The Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet uses a breve on &quot;Ӂ&quot; to represent a voiced postalveolar affricate (corresponding to before a front vowel in the Latin script for Moldovan). In Chuvash, a breve is used for Cyrillic letters Ӑ (&quot;A&quot;-breve) and Ӗ (&quot;E&quot;-breve). In Itelmen orthography, it is used for Ӑ, О̆ and Ў. The traditional Cyrillic breve differs in shape and is thicker on the edges of the curve and thinner in the middle, as opposed to the Latin one, but the Unicode encoding is the same.
In Emilian, &quot;ĕ ŏ&quot; are used to represent in dialects where also long occur.

In Esperanto, &quot;u&quot; with breve (ŭ) represents a non-syllabic &quot;u&quot; in diphthongs , analogous to Belarusian &quot;ў&quot;.

In the transcription of Sinhala, the breve over an &quot;m&quot; or an &quot;n&quot; indicates a prenasalized consonant; for example, &quot;n̆da&quot; is used to represent .

In the International Phonetic Alphabet, a breve over a phonetic symbol is used to indicate extra-shortness.

== Other uses ==
In other languages, it is used for other purposes.

* In Romanian, &quot;A&quot; with breve represents /ə/, as in &quot;măr&quot; (apple).
* G-breve appears in the Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Crimean Tatar, Tatar, and Turkish alphabets. In Turkish, &quot;ğ&quot; lengthens the preceding vowel. It is thus placed between two vowels and is silent in standard Turkish but may be pronounced in some regional dialects or varieties closer to Ottoman Turkish.
* The breve, together with the circumflex and horn, are used in the Vietnamese language to represent additional vowels.
* The McCune-Reischauer romanization system of the Korean alphabet&#x27;s script uses breves over &quot;o&quot; and &quot;u&quot; to represent the vowels ㅓ (ŏ) and ㅡ (ŭ).
* H-breve below Ḫ ḫ is used to transliterate the Arabic character Ḫāʾ () in DIN 31635. It is also used to transliterate Akkadian, Hittite cuneiform, and Egyptian hieroglyphs.
*On German language maps, a double breve is often used in abbreviated placenames that end in &quot;-b͝g.,&quot; short for &quot;-burg,&quot; a common suffix originally meaning &quot;castle&quot;. This prevents misinterpretation as &quot;-berg,&quot; another common suffix in placenames (meaning &quot;mountain&quot;). Thus, for example, &quot;Freib͝g.&quot; stands for &quot;Freiburg,&quot; not &quot;Freiberg.&quot;
*Certain transcription systems for certain varieties of Chinese employ the breve to represent one of the tones, including Foochow Romanized for the Fuzhou dialect of Eastern Min, and Kienning Colloquial Romanized for the Jian&#x27;ou dialect of Northern Min (which also uses the caron).
*In Khmer, ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, œ̆, and ŭ are used in Khmer romanization, e.g. &quot;siĕm reăp&quot; (Siem Reap).
* In the Syriac languages, &quot;ĕ&quot; is used to denote an &quot;eh&quot; or /ˈɛ/ sound.
* The ISO 259 Romanization of Hebrew uses &quot;ă&quot;, &quot;ḝ&quot;, and &quot;ŏ&quot; for reduced vowels.
* In Spanish-language vocal music, a breve below is sometimes used to indicate elision across word boundaries, as in &quot;por-que ̮en-ton-ces.&quot;
* In Malay language, E with breve &quot;ĕ&quot; was used for schwa in Za&#x27;aba Spelling.

== Letters with breve ==
==Breve below==
The breve below is diacritic with the same appearance as the conventional breve, except that it is placed under the letter (or space) to be marked. There are just two precomposed character code-points: and . For other uses, it is rendered as a combining character, . 

Traditional editions of Spanish vocal sheet music use the &#x27;breve below&#x27; to indicate elision. Modern editions tend to use a (freestanding) underscore.

== Encoding ==
Unicode codepoints for breve characters.

In LaTeX the controls \u{o} and \breve{o} put a breve over the letter o.

<text>The FV4034 Challenger 2 (MoD designation &quot;CR2&quot;) is a third generation British main battle tank (MBT) in service with the armies of the United Kingdom, Oman, and Ukraine.

It was designed by Vickers Defence Systems (now BAE Systems Land &amp; Armaments) as a private venture in 1986, and was an extensive redesign of the company&#x27;s earlier Challenger 1 tank. The Ministry of Defence ordered a prototype in December 1988. 
The Challenger 2 has four crew members consisting of a commander, gunner, loader, and driver. The main armament is a L30A1 rifled tank gun, an improved derivative of the L11 gun used on the Chieftain and Challenger 1. Fifty rounds of ammunition are carried for the main armament, alongside 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition for the tank&#x27;s secondary weapons: a L94A1 EX-34 chain gun mounted coaxially, and a L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun. The turret and hull are protected with second generation Chobham armour, also known as Dorchester. Powered by a Perkins CV12-6A V12 diesel engine, the tank has a range of and maximum road speed of .

The Challenger 2 eventually completely replaced the Challenger 1 in British service. In June 1991, the UK ordered 140 vehicles, followed by a further 268 in 1994; these were delivered between 1994 and 2002. The tank entered operational service with the British Army in 1998 and has since been used in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and Iraq. To date, at least three Challenger 2 tanks are confirmed to have been destroyed in operations; the first was by accidental friendly fire from another Challenger 2 in Basra in 2003, and the two others were during the Russo-Ukrainian War, where the tanks were destroyed under Ukrainian control during the 2023 Ukrainian counteroffensive and Ukrainian incursion into Kursk.

Challenger 2 tanks were also ordered by Oman in the 1990s with delivery of 38 vehicles being completed in 2001. A number of British Challenger 2 tanks were delivered to Ukraine in 2023.

Since the Challenger 2 entered service in 1998, various upgrades have sought to improve its protection, mobility and lethality. This has culminated in an upgraded design, known as Challenger 3, which is set to gradually replace Challenger 2 from 2027.

== History ==
===Challenger 1===
The Challenger 2 is the third vehicle of this name, the first being the A30 Challenger, a World War II design using the Cromwell tank chassis with a 17-pounder gun. The second was the Persian Gulf War era Challenger 1, which was the British army&#x27;s main battle tank (MBT) from the early 1980s to the mid-1990s.

While the British Chieftain was heavily armed and armoured, its engine and suspension were considerably subpar compared to its contemporaries, leading to poor cross-country performance and a lack of maneuverability.

Some work on further development of the Chieftain had been ongoing since 1968 at the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE), and several experimental vehicles produced, including one with the recently developed Chobham armour. In September 1978, it was announced that these concepts would be brought together in a new design, MBT-80. Deliveries of the MBT-80 were not expected until the mid-1980s at a minimum. Advances in Soviet armor, especially the apparent upcoming introduction of the T-80, suggested that the UK&#x27;s tanks would be at a significant disadvantage before the MBT-80 would arrive. After considerable debate, MBT-80 was cancelled. Instead, in 1978, the British Army ordered the Challenger 1, based on the Shir 2. The final Challenger 1 was delivered to the British Army in 1990.

===Challenger 2 contest===
As Challenger production ramped up the government was interested in marketing it to its traditional customers like Jordan. To improve its sales prospects, the tank was entered in the 1987 running of the Canadian Army Trophy for tank performance, which had historically been won many times by British Army or Canadian Army units in British tanks. In this run, however, the Challenger performed very poorly, with its units ending up at the bottom of the rankings. While this performance was dismissed by the Ministry of Defense, including in comments in the House of Commons, it was a serious blow to its sales prospects. It also proved only marginally more reliable than the Chieftain, which was considered unreliable and a maintenance problem in the field, and the lack of significant improvement was much to the annoyance of the British Army.

Vickers began considering improvements under the Improved Challenger name in November 1986. They presented their work to the Ministry of Defence (MoD) in March 1987. In February 1988, the MoD issued Staff Requirement 4026, or the Chieftain Replacement Programme, which called for a new design to replace those Chieftains still in service. This program compared the American Abrams (as the XM1 was now known), French Leclerc and German Leopard 2, as well as Vickers&#x27; Improved Challenger. Initial studies by the British Army invariably selected the Leopard 2, which was protected as well as Challenger but had much better mobility and used the smoothbore 120 mm gun that would give it commonality with other NATO forces. The second choice was the Abrams, in second due largely to concerns with its fuel use.

After some supportive lobbying by Baron Young, the Thatcher government chose to proceed with the Vickers entry in December 1988, giving it the official name Challenger 2.

===Prototypes===
Vickers received a £90 million contract for a demonstrator vehicle to be delivered by September 1990. Part of this proof-of-concept phase was the demonstration that a depleted uranium projectile and more powerful gunpowder charge could be developed for the updated &quot;CHARM&quot; 120 mm gun developed at Royal Ordinance, which would give it capability against the latest Soviet designs. The demonstration phase had three milestones for progress, with dates of September 1989, March 1990, and September 1990. At the last of these milestones, Vickers was to have met 11 key criteria for the tank&#x27;s design.

The demonstration phase was generally successful; the major design was completed by August 1989, and production of a series of nine prototypes began. These were largely complete August 1990, and the program as a whole considered successfully completed on time in September. By this point, the Gulf War had started and Challenger 1 was sent to Iraq, where it performed far better than its initial showing would suggest, including performing several very long range kills against Iraqi armor, including one at over range. This performance bolstered the MoD&#x27;s confidence in British armour.

===Production and delivery===
In June 1991 the decision to buy Challenger 2 was made formal with a £520 million contract for 127 tanks and 13 driver training tanks. Production began in 1993 at two primary sites, Elswick, Tyne and Wear and Barnbow, Leeds, with over 250 subcontractors involved. It was formerly accepted on 16 May 1994 with the first tanks delivered in July 1994. An order for a further 259 tanks and 9 driver trainers worth £800 million was placed in July. The Challenger 2 failed its acceptance trials in 1994, and it was forced into the Progressive Reliability Growth Trial in 1995. Three vehicles were tested for 285 simulated battlefield days.

Due to downsizing of the Army after the end of the Cold War, the two runs of Challenger 2 would result in enough tanks to arm the entire Army, as opposed to the mixture of Challenger 1 and 2 that was formerly planned. This made the Challenger 1 surplus, and these were eventually shipped to Jordan for free. Vickers struggled to market the tank for export. Its one success led to Oman ordering 38 Challenger 2s; 18 in June 1993 and a further 20 in November 1997. Both batches ordered by Oman contain notable differences from the UK version: a larger cooling group and rear towing eyes, running gear and bazooka plates similar to Challenger 1, and a loader&#x27;s Browning 0.5 Calibre M2 Heavy Machine Gun. Deliveries of Challenger 2 to Oman were completed in 2001.
The tank was then accepted into service in 1998. An equally important milestone was the In-Service Reliability Demonstration (ISRD) in 1998. The CR2 In-Service Reliability Demonstration (ISRD) milestone was successfully achieved in January 1999. The ISRD took place from September to December 1998. 12 fully crewed tanks were tested at the Bovington test tracks and the Lulworth Bindon ranges. The tank exceeded all staff requirements.

===Later developments and possible replacement===
The Challenger 2 entered service with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, with the last delivered in 2002. After the Army 2020 restructuring, only three Challenger 2 Tank Regiments will remain: the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars, the King&#x27;s Royal Hussars and the Royal Tank Regiment, each of which is the tank regiment of an Armoured Infantry Brigade. A single Army Reserve regiment, The Royal Wessex Yeomanry, will provide reservist Challenger crews to the regular regiments.

The Trojan minefield breaching vehicle and the Titan bridge-laying vehicle based on the chassis of the Challenger 2 were shown in November 2006. 66 are to be supplied by BAE Systems to the Royal Engineers, at a cost of £250 million.

A British military document from 2001 indicated that the British Army would not procure a replacement for the Challenger 2 because of a lack of foreseeable conventional threats in the future. However, IHS Jane&#x27;s 360 reported in September 2015 that following discussions with senior Army officers and procurement officials at DSEI 2015 and the head of the British Army, General Sir Nick Carter, that the British Army was looking at either upgrading the Challenger 2 or outright replacing it. Sources confirmed that the future of the MBT was being considered at the highest levels of the Army.

This stemmed from the British Army&#x27;s concern with the new Russian T-14 Armata main battle tank and the growing ineffectiveness of the ageing L30 rifled gun and the limited types of ammunition supported. It was confirmed that numerous armoured vehicle manufacturers had discussions with the MoD about a potential replacement for the Challenger 2. Shortly after, the British Army decided that purchasing a new tank would be too expensive and chose to proceed with the Challenger 2 Life Extension Project (LEP). The Challenger 2 is expected to remain in service until 2025.

Between 2010 and 2014, 43 Challenger 2 tanks were disposed of as &quot;beyond any economic repair&quot;.

The maintenance contract was let sometime in 2021.
 maintenance and overhaul of the Challenger 2 is undertaken by the Babcock Defence Support Group. Design authority for the tank is held by Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL). Engineering work is to be completed by RBSL and integration work by Babcock. This complicated two-part project is detailed below. The initial operating capability for the upgraded Challenger 3 tanks is expected by 2027.

In May 2021, the UK MoD published a command paper entitled &quot;Defence in a Competitive Age&quot;. In it, the MoD proposed to retire 79 tanks from the current fleet of 227, with the remaining 148 vehicles upgraded to Challenger 3 status.

===Supply to Ukraine===
After the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the then British Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, declined Ukrainian requests for Challenger 2 tanks to be part of the military aid packages arranged by the United Kingdom and other NATO countries. British Defence Secretary Ben Wallace had said that the idea &quot;wouldn&#x27;t work&quot;. In April 2022, Johnson and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz stated that both Western European allies would withhold their MBTs from the war. Johnson instead chose to deploy British Challenger 2 tanks to Poland to backfill the Polish Army and allowing the Polish government to donate Soviet-era T-72s to Ukraine.

On 14 January 2023, the British government confirmed reports that in light of the developing situation in Ukraine, it had reversed its position on the supply of Challenger 2 tanks to Ukraine. An initial commitment of 14 vehicles was announced, alongside 30 AS-90 155 mm self-propelled guns, and armoured repair and recovery vehicles. A spokesperson for the British Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, described the move as reflecting &quot;the UK&#x27;s ambition to intensify support&quot;. These tanks were the first Western MBTs offered to Ukraine, supplementing donations of Western manufactured infantry fighting vehicles, armoured personnel carriers, and self-propelled artillery; A number of other countries have subsequently announced that they would supply Ukraine with Western-manufactured MBTs; specifically the American M1 Abrams and German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2.

On 29 January 2023, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that the first Ukrainian troops had arrived in the UK to begin training on Challenger 2. On 8 February, Sunak and Ukrainian President Zelensky paid a visit to Ukrainian soldiers at Lulworth Camp where they were being trained on Challenger 2 tanks by British soldiers from the Royal Tank Regiment and the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars. Sunak used the opportunity to reaffirm the British intention to have the first Challenger 2 tanks delivered to Ukraine by March 2023.

On 27 March 2023, the UK Ministry of Defence announced that Ukrainian tank crews had completed their training in the UK on Challenger 2 tanks, and had returned to Ukraine.

On 18 August 2023 a picture of a Challenger 2 in Ukraine was released on Twitter. Unique modifications include top-mounted slat armour believed to be used to stop drone attacks.

On 4 September 2023, a video emerged from Robotyne which showed the first combat loss of the Challenger 2 tank.

During the Ukrainian incursion into Kursk, 3 more Challenger 2 tanks were visually confirmed to have been destroyed.

== Design ==
=== Armament ===


The Challenger 2 is equipped with a 55-calibre long L30A1 tank gun, the successor to the L11 gun used on Chieftain and Challenger 1. The gun is made from high strength electro-slag remelting (ESR) steel with a chromium alloy lining. Like earlier British 120 mm guns, it is insulated by a thermal sleeve. It is fitted with a muzzle reference system and fume extractor, and is controlled by an all-electric control and stabilisation system. The turret has a rotation time of 9 seconds through 360 degrees.

Uniquely among NATO main battle tank guns, the L30A1 is rifled and along with its predecessor, the Royal Ordnance L11A5, the only Third Generation Main Battle Tank Guns to use a rifled barrel. This is because the British Army continues to place a premium on the use of high explosive squash head (HESH) rounds in addition to armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot (APFSDS) rounds. HESH rounds have a longer range (up to further) than APFSDS, and are more effective against buildings and thin-skinned vehicles.

Forty-nine main armament rounds are carried in the turret and hull. These are a mix of L27A1 APFSDS (also referred to as CHARM 3), L31 HESH and L34 white phosphorus smoke rounds, depending on the situation. As with earlier versions of the 120 mm gun, the propellant charges are loaded separately from the shell or KE projectile. A combustible rigid charge is used for the APFSDS rounds and a combustible hemicylindrical bag charge for the HESH and smoke rounds. An electrically fired vent tube is used to initiate firing of the main armament rounds. The main armament ammunition is described to be &quot;three-part ammunition&quot;, consisting of the projectile, charge and vent tube. The separation of ammunition pieces aids in ensuring lower chances of unfired ammunition detonating prematurely.

The Challenger 2 is also armed with a L94A1 EX-34 7.62 mm chain gun coaxially to the left of the main gun, and a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun mounted on a pintle on the loader&#x27;s hatch ring. 4,200 rounds of 7.62 mm ammunition are carried. The Challenger can also mount a Leonardo &quot;Enforcer&quot; remote control weapons system, bearing a 7.62 mm L37A2 (GPMG) machine gun, a 12.7 mm heavy machine gun or a 40 mm automatic grenade launcher.

=== Fire control and sights ===
The digital fire control computer from Computing Devices Co of Canada contains two 32-bit processors with a MIL STD1553B databus. It has capacity for additional systems, such as a Battlefield Information Control System.

The commander has a panoramic SAGEM VS 580-10 gyrostabilised sight with laser rangefinder. The elevation range is +35° to −35°. The commander&#x27;s station is equipped with eight periscopes for 360° vision.

The Thermal Observation and Gunnery Sight II (TOGS II), from Thales, provides night vision. The thermal image is displayed on both the gunner&#x27;s and commander&#x27;s sights and monitors. The gunner has a stabilised primary sight using a laser rangefinder, with a range of to . The driver&#x27;s position is equipped with a Thales Optronics image-intensifying Passive Driving Periscope (PDP) for night driving and a rear view thermal camera.

=== Protection ===
The Challenger 2 is a heavily armoured and well protected tank. The turret and hull are protected by second-generation Chobham armour, also known as Dorchester, the details of which are classified but which is said to have a mass efficiency more than twice that of rolled homogeneous armour against high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) projectiles. Crew safety was paramount in the design. It uses a solid state electric drive for turret and gun motion, instead of hydraulic systems that can leak fluid into the crew compartment.

Explosive reactive armour kits and additional bar armour may be fitted as needed. The nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) protection system is located in the turret bustle. The tank&#x27;s shape is designed to minimise its radar signature. On each side of the turret are five L8 smoke grenade dischargers. The Challenger 2 can create smoke by injecting diesel fuel into the exhaust manifolds.

=== Drive system ===
The tank&#x27;s drive system comprises:
* Engine: Perkins 26.1 litre, 60° vee, twin turbocharged, CV12-6A four-stroke, four-valve-per-cylinder (pushrod), direct-injection diesel engine delivering at 2300 rpm. Torque 4126 Nm at 1700 rpm. The engine and gearbox are controlled by a Petards Vehicle Integrated Control System (VICS).
* Gearbox: David Brown Santasalo TN54E epicyclical transmission (6 fwd, 2 rev.) rated at 1200 bhp and upgradable to 1500 bhp.
* Suspension: Horstman Defence Systems second-generation hydrogas suspension units (HSU).
* Track: William Cook Defence hydraulically adjustable TR60 414FS double-pin.
* Maximum speed: on road; cross country
* Range: on road with external fuel; cross country on internal fuel.

The tank is fitted with an Extel Systems Wedel auxiliary power unit, an APU, also referred to as a generating unit engine (GUE), based on a 38 kW Perkins P404C-22 diesel engine. It has a 600 A electrical output, which can be used to power the vehicle&#x27;s electrical systems when it is stationary and the main engine is switched off. This replaces the Perkins P4.108 engine fitted when the tank was first introduced. The use of an APU allows fuel consumption to be reduced, and lowers the audio and thermal signature of the vehicle.

By 2013 the British Army had, at various events featuring the Challenger 2, begun to state the on-road range as 550 km as opposed to an earlier stated value of 450 km. They also publicly stated a maximum road speed of 59 km/h while equipped with 15 tons of additional modules.

=== Crew and accommodation ===
The British Army maintained its requirement for a four-man crew, including a loader, after risk analysis of the incorporation of an automatic loader suggested that autoloaders reduced battlefield survivability. Mechanical failure and the time required for repair were prime concerns.

Similar to every British tank since the Centurion, and most other British AFVs, Challenger 2 contains a boiling vessel (BV) for water, for use preparing and heating food and drink.

===Maintenance===
Challenger 2 tanks require two sets of tools, as the hull is built using imperial measurements and the turret is built to metric measurements.

== Operational history ==

The first operational deployments of Challenger 2 tanks were to support peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo.

Challenger 2 was first used in combat in March 2003 during the invasion of Iraq. The 120 tanks of 7th Armoured Brigade, part of 1st Armoured Division, went into action around Basra. The type saw extensive use during the siege of the city, providing fire support to the British forces and knocking out Iraqi tanks, mainly T-54/55s.

The tanks deployed to Iraq were &quot;desertised&quot; in an effort to avoid the difficulties that had been identified in Challenger 2 during Exercise Saif Sareea II in Oman 18 month earlier. The addition of sand filters and other modifications through a series of Urgent Operational Requirements substantially improved the platform&#x27;s operational availability.


During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Challenger 2 tanks suffered no tank losses to Iraqi fire. In one encounter within an urban area, a Challenger 2 came under attack from irregular forces with machine guns and rocket propelled grenades (RPGs). The driver&#x27;s sight was damaged and while attempting to back away under the commander&#x27;s directions, the other sights were damaged and the tank threw its tracks entering a ditch. The crew survived, safe within the tank until it was recovered for repairs, the worst damage being to the sighting system. It was back in operation six hours later.
* 25 March 2003: A friendly fire (&quot;blue-on-blue&quot;) incident in Basra in which one Challenger 2 of the Black Watch Battlegroup (2nd Royal Tank Regiment) mistakenly engaged another Challenger 2 of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers after detecting what was believed to be an enemy flanking manoeuvre on thermal equipment. The attacking tank&#x27;s second HESH round hit the open commander&#x27;s hatch lid of the QRL tank sending hot fragments into the turret, killing two crew members. The hit caused a fire that eventually ignited the stowed ammunition, destroying the tank. This was the first Challenger 2 to be destroyed on operations.
* August 2006: An RPG-29 capable of firing a tandem-charge penetrated the frontal lower underbelly armour of a Challenger 2 commanded by Captain Thomas Williams of The Queens&#x27;s Royal Hussars south east of al-Amarah, southern Iraq. Its driver, Trooper Sean Chance, lost part of his foot in the blast; two more of the crew were slightly injured. Chance was able to reverse the vehicle to the regimental aid post despite his injuries. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations that crews had been told the tank was impervious to the insurgents&#x27; weapons, the MoD said &quot;We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.&quot;
* 6 April 2007: In Basra, Iraq, a shaped charge from an improvised explosive device (IED) penetrated the underside of a tank resulting in the driver losing a leg and causing minor injuries to another soldier.
To help prevent incidents of this nature, Challenger 2s have been upgraded with a new passive armour package, including the use of add-on armour manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems of Israel. When deployed on operations the Challenger 2 is now normally upgraded to Theatre Entry Standard (TES), which includes a number of modifications including armour and weapon system upgrades.

Since 2017, the UK has regularly deployed Challenger 2 tanks, alongside Warrior Infantry Fighting Vehicles, to Estonia as part of Operation Cabrit. The two squadrons of tanks currently deployed, form part of the British contribution to the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence multinational battlegroup in the Baltics.

In July 2022, a squadron of 14 Challenger 2 tanks of the Queen&#x27;s Royal Hussars were sent to Poland on an initial 6 month deployment. The squadron is to be integrated into a Polish battlegroup under Polish command. The move is designed to &#x27;backfill&#x27; Polish capability after Polish T-72 tanks were donated to Ukraine.

On 21 June 2023, the Ukrainian army released a video purportedly showing the Challenger 2 in Ukraine. The tanks are assigned to the 11th Separate Army Aviation although this may be a deception move. In September 2023, Ukrainian Air Assault Forces Command published a video interview with a Ukrainian Challenger 2 crew member who stated that the tank was a &quot;sniper rifle among tanks&quot; due to its accuracy. 

On 4 September 2023, a video emerged from Robotyne which showed the first combat loss of a Challenger 2 tank. A 9M133 Kornet missile triggered a fire that apparently cooked off the Challenger 2&#x27;s ammunition charges, and the resulting blast wrenched the Challenger 2&#x27;s turret from its hull.
According to Ukrainian media in 10 March 2024: two more Challenger 2s had been damaged and repaired; only 7 of 14 remain in combat-ready condition. It is often necessary to repair turret parts and the aiming system; the low level of readiness is due to delays getting parts for routine repairs. One Ukrainian Challenger 2 crew member told the tank’s 1,200-horsepower engine is under-powered for a 71-ton vehicle, and they often get bogged down in soft soil and need towing by other Challengers or engineering vehicles. While a smoothbore 120 mm L44 tank cannon has a useful life of up to 1,500 rounds, a rifled L30A1 wears out after only 500 rounds.
In August 2024, British news media reported that Challenger 2 tanks were participating in Ukraine&#x27;s Kursk Oblast incursion. During the incursion a Challenger 2 tank was destroyed by Russian forces using a Lancet loitering munition; this would the second confirmed loss of the tank during the war. There is plausible evidence that a third Challenger 2 tank was destroyed south of Malaya Loknya during the incursion on 5 January 2025 after a Russian FPV drone struck the gun mantlet.

== Upgrades ==
=== CLIP ===
The Challenger Lethality Improvement Programme (CLIP) was a programme to replace the current L30A1 rifled gun with the smoothbore Rheinmetall 120 mm gun currently used in the Leopard 2 and M1 Abrams. The use of a smoothbore weapon would have allowed Challenger 2 to use NATO standard ammunition, including tungsten-based kinetic energy penetrators which do not have the same political and environmental objections as depleted uranium rounds. The production lines for rifled 120mm ammunition in the UK have been closed for some years so existing stocks of ammunition for the L30A1 are finite.
A single Challenger 2 was fitted with the L55 and underwent trials in January 2006. The smoothbore gun was the same length as the L30A1 and was fitted with the rifled gun&#x27;s cradle, thermal sleeve, bore evacuator and muzzle reference system. Early trials apparently revealed that the German tungsten DM53 round was more effective than the depleted uranium CHARM 3. The ammunition storage and handling arrangements had to be changed to cater for the single-piece smoothbore rounds, instead of the separate-loading rifled rounds. Other improvements were also considered, including a regenerative NBC protection system.

=== HAAIP ===

Updates to the automotive components of Challenger 2 are being undertaken as part of the ongoing Heavy Armour Automotive Improvement Programme (HAAIP), which is expected to continue until 2031, and expected to align with the Challenger 3 programme. The HAAIP programme &quot;will be made to existing in-service Challenger 2 tanks to increase their mobility and stability, both of which are critical to providing the foundation for the new turret and systems that will upgrade the vehicle to a Challenger 3.&quot;

HAAIP has already led to upgrades to the air filtration system, through the use of cleanable air filters with increased operating life, which were tested in Exercise Saif Sareea 3 in October 2018. The HAAIP programme, awarded to BAE Systems, was intended to apply a common engine and suspension standard to Challenger 2, the DTT, CRARRV, Titan and Trojan, improving reliability. However the Minister of State for Defence announced in April 2022 that a common engine (build standard) will be applied to Challenger 2, Challenger 3 and CRARRV only after a new refrigerant is found for the CTCS (Crew Temperature Control System).

In terms of the powertrain, BAE Systems were evaluating whether to uprate the existing CV12 engine or swap this for alternative designs. The proposed CV12 upgrade by Caterpillar Defense would fit electronically controlled common rail fuel injection and introduce engine health monitoring (HUMS). This would increase the maximum power output from 1,200bhp (at 2,300 rpm) to 1,500bhp (at 2,400 rpm), reduce battlefield smoke emissions, and improve fleet reliability and availability. Since this information was released (February 2019) no further information in the public domain has been released regarding fitting Common Rail Fuel Injection and HUMS. The engines and transmission units have themselves also been remanufactured in recent years, with parts and equipment also purchased to convert CV12-6A engines to CV12-8A build standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;United Kingdom-Bristol: Repair and maintenance services of military vehicles, 2014/S 172-305466&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United Kingdom-Telford: Repair and maintenance services of vehicle transmissions, 2018/S 138-316646&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;United Kingdom-Telford: Repair, maintenance and associated services of vehicles and related equipment, 2020/S 034-081842&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Publications in support of tender procurement for HAAIP indicate that a new CV12-9A engine build standard will be used for the Challenger 2s upgraded to become Challenger 3s, and for CRARRV.

Work to update the base Challenger 2 hull and automotive components, undertaken by DE&amp;S, RBSL and Babcock, commenced in July 2021 in advance of these being converted to Challenger 3s. Equipment replaced during HAAIP will be checked for serviceability, repaired if required, and returned for re-use in the existing Challenger 2 fleet. The hulls will also undergo ultrasonic testing, weld repairs and repainting.

The overall scope of HAAIP includes:
* Upgraded CV12-9A engines for Challenger 3 and CRARRV
* Third Generation Hydrogas Suspension
* New Hydraulic Track Tensioners (HTT) with inline accumulators
* Improved Electric Cold Start System (Intake Manifold Heater)
* Unspecified new components fitted to improve the transmissions
* New Main Engine Air Intake Filters
* Improved Main Engine/Transmission Cooling; fitting new high efficiency radiators (596 sets) and fans (294 triple fan sets with mountings and drive systems). These new more modern assemblies will increase cooling capacity and reduce engine fuel cutback mode (where engine power is reduced if cooling capacity for the main engine and transmission is exceeded) through improved air flow efficiency. The contract for the new cooling fans has been awarded to AMETEK Airtechnology Group (the suppliers of the current design) and the contract for the new radiators awarded to Caterpillar.

As of January 2022 six Challenger 2s were reported to have received the automotive upgrades prior to conversion to Challenger 3s.

=== CSP / LEP / Challenger 3 ===
In 2005, the MoD recognised a need for a Capability Sustainment Programme (CSP) to extend the service life of the Challenger 2 into the mid-2030s and upgrade its mobility, lethality and survivability. The CSP was planned to be complete by 2020 and was to combine all the upgrades from CLIP, including the fitting of a 120 mm smoothbore gun.

By 2014, the CSP programme had been replaced by the Life Extension Programme (LEP) which shared a similar scope of replacing obsolete components and extending the tank&#x27;s service life from 2025 to 2035, however the 120 mm smoothbore gun had seemingly been abandoned.

In 2015, the British Army provided an insight into the scope of the LEP, dividing it into four key areas, namely:
* Surveillance and target acquisition: Upgrades to the commander&#x27;s primary sight and gunner&#x27;s primary sight, as well as the replacement of the thermal observation and gunnery sights (TOGS) with third-generation thermal imaging.
* Weapon control system: Upgrades to the fire control computer, fire control panel and gun processing unit.
* Mobility: Upgrades including third-generation hydrogas suspension, improved air filtration, CV-12 common rail fuel injection, transmission and cooling.
* Electronic architecture: Upgrades to the gunner&#x27;s control handles, video distribution architecture, generic vehicle architecture compliant interfaces, increased onboard processing and improved human machine interface.

The MoD also began assessing active protection systems (APS) on the Challenger 2, including MUSS and Rheinmetall&#x27;s ROSY Rapid Obscurant System.

In August 2016, the MoD awarded assessment phase contracts to several companies for the Life Extension Programme. These included Team Challenger 2 (a consortium led by BAE Systems and including General Dynamics UK), CMI Defence and Ricardo plc, Rheinmetall and Lockheed Martin UK. In November, the MoD shortlisted two teams led by BAE Systems and Rheinmetall to compete for the LEP which was then estimated to be worth £650 million ($802 million).

In October 2018, BAE Systems unveiled its proposed Challenger 2 LEP technology demonstrator, the &quot;Black Night&quot;. The new improvements included a Safran PASEO commander&#x27;s sight, Leonardo thermal imager for the gunner and Leonardo DNVS 4 night sight. The turret also received modifications to improve the speed of traverse and to provide greater space as well as regenerative braking to generate and store power. Other enhancements included a laser warning system and an active protection system. Months later, in January 2019, Rheinmetall unveiled its proposal which included the development of a completely new turret with fully digital electronic architecture, day and night sights for the commander and gunner, and a Rheinmetall L55 120mm smoothbore gun. Whilst a more substantial upgrade than Black Night, the turret was developed on Rheinmetall&#x27;s initiative and was not funded by the UK MoD, nor was it part of the MoD&#x27;s LEP requirements.

In June 2019, BAE Systems and Rheinmetall formed a joint venture company, based in the UK, named Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land (RBSL). Despite the merger, the company was still expected to present two separate proposals for the LEP contract, however, at DSEI 2019, RBSL instead opted to only showcase the Rheinmetall proposal.

In October 2020, the MoD argued against buying a new main battle tank from overseas instead of pursuing the Challenger 2 LEP, stating that an upgraded Challenger 2 would be &quot;comparable – and in certain areas superior&quot; to a Leopard 2 or Abrams.

On 22 March 2021, the MoD published its long-awaited command paper, &quot;Defence in a Competitive Age&quot;, which confirmed the British Army&#x27;s plans to upgrade 148 Challenger 2 tanks and designate them Challenger 3. The MoD confirmed the contract with RBSL had been signed, valued at £800 million (US$1 billion), on 7 May 2021. Rheinmetall&#x27;s more extensive upgrade proposal, including the new 120 mm smoothbore gun, had been accepted. The initial operating capability for the upgraded tanks is expected by 2027, with full operation capability expected to be declared by 2030.

=== Other in-service upgrades ===

On 15 December 2017, BAE Systems was awarded a contract to maintain the Challenger 2&#x27;s thermal imaging system as part of a £15.4 million interim solution separate to the LEP. In October 2019, it was announced that Thales would be supplying their Catherine Megapixel (MP) thermal imaging camera.
In August 2023, photos appeared of Challenger 2s in Ukrainian service featuring top-mounted slat armor, similar to those found on Russian vehicles used in the conflict, primarily to protect from UAV attacks. The tank was also equipped with slat armor covering the hull flanks and lower frontal hull plate.

==Variants==
=== Challenger 2 Driver Training Tank ===

The Challenger 2 Driver Training Tank (DTT) is based on the Challenger 2 hull. The turret has been replaced with a fixed weighted superstructure to accommodate an instructor and up to 4 trainees. The design is similar to the Challenger 1 derived Challenger Training Tank (CTT). Weighting the superstructure replicates the weight (and therefore also the driving characteristics) of the standard tank in operational service. 22 DTTs are in British service, with 2 in service with Oman.

=== Titan ===
The Titan armoured bridge layer is based on aspects of the Challenger 2 running gear and replaced the &quot;Chieftain Armoured Vehicle Launched Bridge&quot; (ChAVLB). The Titan came into service in 2006 with the Royal Engineers, with 33 in service. Titan can carry a single 26-metre-long bridge or two 12-metre-long bridges. It can also be fitted with a bulldozer blade.

=== Trojan ===

The Trojan Armoured Vehicle Royal Engineers is a combat engineering vehicle designed as a replacement for the &quot;Chieftain AVRE&quot; (ChAVRE). It uses the Challenger 2 chassis, and carries an articulated excavator arm, a dozer blade, and attachment rails for fascines. Entering service in 2007, 33 were produced.

=== Challenger 2E ===
The Challenger 2E is an export version of the tank. It has a new integrated weapon control and battlefield management system, which includes a gyrostabilised panoramic SAGEM MVS 580-day/thermal sight for the commander and SAGEM SAVAN 15 gyrostabilised day/thermal sight for the gunner, both with eye-safe laser rangefinder. This allows hunter/killer operations with a common engagement sequence. An optional servo-controlled overhead weapons platform can be slaved to the commander&#x27;s sight to allow operation independent from the turret.

The power pack has been replaced by a new EuroPowerPack with a transversely mounted MTU MT883 diesel engine coupled to Renk HSWL 295TM automatic transmission. The increase in both vehicle performance and durability is significant. The smaller volume but more powerful EuroPowerPack additionally incorporates as standard a cooling system and air intake filtration system proved in desert use.

The free space in the hull is available for ammunition stowage or for fuel, increasing the vehicle&#x27;s range to . This power pack was previously installed on the French Leclerc tanks delivered to the UAE as well as the recovery tank version of the Leclerc in service with the French Army. Further developed versions of the EuroPowerPack have more recently been installed in the latest serial produced Korean K2 Black Panther tank.

BAES announced in 2005 that development and export marketing of 2E would stop. This has been linked by the media to the failure of the 2E to be selected for the Hellenic Army in 2002, a competition won by the Leopard 2.

=== CRARRV ===
The Challenger Armoured Repair and Recovery Vehicle (CRARRV) is an armoured recovery vehicle based on the Challenger 1 hull, designed to repair and recover damaged tanks on the battlefield. Ordered in 1985, and delivered between 1988 and 1993, the CRARRV has subsequently been updated to use a Challenger 2 powertrain consisting of a CV12-5C/6C engine with TN54E transmission. The British Army ordered 80 vehicles. Four CRARRVs were purchased by Oman to complement their acquisition of Challenger 2 tanks.

CRARRVs were first deployed in action in the lead up to the First Gulf War, Operation Granby in 1991. They were subsequently deployed during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Operation Telic in 2003, alongside standard Challenger 2 MBTs.
== Operators ==

* : British Army - 386 delivered + 22 driver trainer units. 219 remain in operational service as of 2024.

* : Royal Army of Oman – 38 purchased from 1993 onwards.
* : Ukrainian Air Assault Forces – in January 2023 it was confirmed that the United Kingdom will supply Ukraine with 14 Challenger 2 main battle tanks along with support vehicles. On 29 January 2023, the first Ukrainian troops arrived in the UK to begin training on Challenger 2 tanks. These troops completed their training on 27 March and returned to Ukraine; the first Challenger 2 tanks were delivered to Ukraine on the same date. As of 10 March 2024, 13 units remained in operational status among Ukrainian Armed Forces. As of 6 January 2025, four units have been confirmed destroyed, based on visual evidence. The third claimed kill used a six second video clip posted on social media of a FPV drone striking a Challenger 2 parked in a tree line near the driver’s position.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* In July 2001, the commander and operator-loader of a Challenger 2 were killed in an accident in the Salisbury Plain Training Area, near Imber. Their tank rolled over after falling off the edge of a track, crushing both men who suffered fatal injuries. At the subsequent inquest, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and called for improvements in training given to inexperienced tank crews.
* On 1 June 2015, a Challenger 2 on exercise in Lippe (district), near Paderborn, Germany, crushed the car of a learner driver who pulled out in front of a column of British armoured vehicles. The driver was unhurt.
* On 14 June 2017, a Challenger 2 from The Royal Tank Regiment suffered an ammunition explosion during live firing exercises at the Castlemartin Range in Pembrokeshire. The tank was firing 120 mm practice shells with a standard propellant charge. The explosion critically injured the four-man crew, with two later dying of their wounds in hospital. The incident resulted in all British Army tank firing exercises being suspended for 48 hours while the cause of the explosion was investigated. It was later determined that a bolt vent axial (BVA) seal assembly had been removed during an earlier exercise and had not been replaced at the time of the incident, allowing explosive gases to enter the turret space; the lack of a written process for removal and replacement of the seal assembly meant that the crew at the time of the incident were unaware of its absence, and it was also noted that inadequate consideration had been given during the production of the L30 gun as to whether it could be fired without the seal assembly. A second explosion that occurred during the incident was attributed to the detonation of bag charges that had not been stowed in the internal ammunition bins, as required by correct procedure.

===War Thunder classified documents incident===
In July 2021, excerpts of the tank&#x27;s &quot;Army Equipment Support Publication&quot; (i.e. the user manual), containing technical specifications of the vehicle, were posted on the official forums of the war simulation game &quot;War Thunder&quot;; the poster, allegedly a Challenger 2 tank commander, said he had done so in the hope that developer Gaijin Entertainment would modify the performance of the in-game tank to match the specifications detailed in the document. The leaked excerpts of the AESP document had been edited to appear as though it had been declassified under the UK&#x27;s Freedom of Information Act 2000. However, the MoD confirmed that the information was in fact still classified, and that if Gaijin were to disseminate the tank&#x27;s specifications, they would be liable to prosecution under the Official Secrets Act. Due to these possible legal penalties, Gaijin refused to handle or utilise the leaked specifications.

==Future replacement==
Following Britain&#x27;s exit from the European Union, early in 2021 the United Kingdom entered talks to be allowed into the European Main Battle Tank project as an observer. This may have a bearing on a future replacement of the Challenger 3.

== Vehicles on display ==
Many of the pre-production prototype Challenger 2 vehicles are on display in the United Kingdom:
* The third and fifth prototype vehicles are displayed at The Tank Museum, Bovington, Dorset.
* The fourth prototype is a gate guardian outside the Royal Armoured Corps Gunnery School, Lulworth Camp, Dorset.
* The seventh prototype vehicle has been plinthed outside the National Army Museum in Chelsea, London, since 2021. This vehicle also appeared in Vickers&#x27; original sales marketing.
* The eighth prototype is in the teaching collection of the Defence Academy, Shrivenham, Oxfordshire.
* The ninth prototype vehicle has been displayed outside the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne since 2014. It was previously displayed outside the Vickers Elswick plant in the city.
* A Challenger 2, likely a prototype, is plinthed outside Allenby Barracks, Bovington Camp, Dorset.
* The prototype CRARRV is on display at The REME Museum at MoD Lyneham, Wiltshire.

In 2021, the then UK Minister for Defence Procurement, Jeremy Quin, acknowledged in a written answer, that were no current plans to dispose of a production vehicle to a museum, but that the UK MoD were aware that The Tank Museum intend to secure one for their collection.

<doc id="172379" wikidata="Q572717" url="?curid=172379" title="Music of Jamaica">
<text>The music of Jamaica includes Jamaican folk music and many popular genres, such as mento, ska, rocksteady, reggae, dub music, dancehall, reggae fusion and related styles.

Reggae is especially popular through the fame of Bob Marley. Jamaican music&#x27;s influence on music styles in other countries includes the practice of toasting, which was brought to New York City and evolved into rapping. British genres such as Lovers rock, jungle music and grime are also influenced by Jamaican music.

==Mento==

Mento is a style of Jamaican music that predates and has greatly influenced ska and reggae music. Lord Flea and Count Lasher are two of the more successful mento artists. Well-known mento songs include Day-O, Jamaica Farewell and Linstead Market. Mento is often confused with Calypso music, a musical form from Trinidad and Tobago.

==Calypso and Soca==
As in many Anglo-Caribbean islands, the calypso music of Trinidad and Tobago has become part of the culture of Jamaica. Jamaica&#x27;s own local music mento is often confused with calypso music. Although the two share many similarities, they are separate and distinct musical forms. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently referred to as &quot;calypso&quot;, &quot;kalypso&quot; and &quot;mento calypso&quot;; mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques. As in calypso, mento uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues. Sexual innuendos are also common.

The Trinidadian calypso and soca music are popular in Jamaica. Popular calypso/soca artists from Jamaica include Byron Lee, Fab 5, and Lovindeer. Harry Belafonte (born in the U.S., raised in Jamaica from age 5 to 13) introduced American audiences to calypso music (which had originated in Trinidad and Tobago in the early 20th century), and Belafonte was dubbed the &quot;King of Calypso&quot;.

==Jazz==
From early in the 20th century, Jamaica produced many notable jazz musicians. In this development the enlightened policy of the Alpha Boys School in Kingston, which provided training and encouragement in music education for its pupils, was very influential. Also significant was the brass band tradition of the island, strengthened by opportunities for musical work and training in military contexts. However, limited scope for making a career playing jazz in Jamaica resulted in many local jazz musicians leaving the island to settle in London or in the United States.

Among the most notable Jamaican jazz instrumentalists who made successful careers abroad was alto saxophonist Joe Harriott, now regarded internationally as one of the most original and innovative of jazz composers. Also internationally successful were trumpeters Dizzy Reece, Leslie &#x27;Jiver&#x27; Hutchinson and Leslie Thompson, bassist Coleridge Goode, guitarist Ernest Ranglin and pianist Monty Alexander.

Harriott, Goode, Hutchinson and Thompson built their careers in London, along with many other instrumentalists, such as pianist Yorke de Souza and the outstanding saxophonist Bertie King, who later returned to Jamaica and formed a mento-style band. Reece and Alexander worked in the US. Saxophonist Wilton &#x27;Bogey&#x27; Gaynair settled in Germany working mainly with Kurt Edelhagen&#x27;s orchestra.

==Ska==
Ska is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1950s and was the precursor to rocksteady and reggae. Ska combined elements of Caribbean mento and Calypso music calypso with United States American jazz and rhythm and blues. The first ever ska recording was made by Count Ossie, a Nyabinghi drummer from the rasta community. It is characterized by a walking bass line accented with rhythms on the upbeat. In the early 1960s, ska was the dominant music genre of Jamaica and was popular with British mods.

Music historians typically divide the history of ska into three periods: the original Jamaican scene of the 1960s (First Wave), the English 2 Tone ska revival of the late 1970s (Second Wave) and the third wave ska movement, which started in the 1980s (Third Wave) and rose to popularity in the US in the 1990s. The recent revival of ska jazz Jamaican Jazz attempts to bring back the sound of early Jamaican music artists of the late 1950s.
==DJs and toasting==
Along with the rise of ska came the popularity of deejays such as Sir Lord Comic, King Stitt and pioneer Count Matchuki, who began talking stylistically over the rhythms of popular songs at sound systems. In Jamaican music, the Deejay is the one who talks (known elsewhere as the MC) and the selector is the person who chooses the records. The popularity of Deejays as an essential component of the sound system, and created a need for instrumental songs, as well as instrumental versions of popular vocal songs.

Toasting is a type of lyrical chanting over the beat. While Dancehall music involves deejays, they are the ones chanting or humming over the rhythm or track. With the rise of many different genres, toasting became popular in Jamaica during the 1960s and 1970s.

In the late 1960s, producers such as King Tubby and Lee Perry began stripping the vocals away from tracks recorded for sound system parties. With the bare beats and bass playing and the lead instruments dropping in and out of the mix, Deejays began toasting, or delivering humorous and often provoking jabs at fellow deejays and local celebrities. Over time, toasting became an increasingly complex activity, and became as big a draw as the dance beats played behind it.

The basic elements of hip-hop—boasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and political commentary—were all present in Jamaican music When rocksteady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they used Jamaican culture. Jamaican music, moved back and forth between the predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with &#x27;slackness&#x27; and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, &#x27;conscious&#x27; style.

==Rocksteady==
Rocksteady was the music of Jamaica&#x27;s rude boys by the mid-1960s, when The Wailers and The Clarendonians dominated the charts. Desmond Dekker&#x27;s &quot;007&quot; brought international attention to the new genre. The mix put heavy emphasis on the bass line, as opposed to ska&#x27;s strong horn section, and the rhythm guitar began playing on the upbeat. Session musicians like Supersonics, Soul Vendors, Jets and Jackie Mittoo (of the Skatalites) became popular during this period.

==Reggae==
Reggae is one of the music genres first created in Jamaica. In the late 1960s, around the same time of toasting, reggae grew out of early Ska and Rocksteady.

Reggae became popular around the world, due in large part to the international success of artists like Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer. Marley was viewed as a Rastafarian messianic figure by some fans, particularly throughout the Caribbean, Africa, and among Native Americans and Australian Aborigines. His lyrics about love, redemption and natural beauty captivated audiences, and he gained headlines for negotiating truces between the two opposing Jamaican political parties (at the One Love Concert), led by Michael Manley (PNP) and Edward Seaga.

==Dub==
By 1973, dub music had emerged as a distinct reggae genre, and heralded the dawn of the remix. Developed by record producers such as Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry and King Tubby, dub featured previously recorded songs remixed with prominence on the bass. Often the lead instruments and vocals would drop in and out of the mix, sometimes processed heavily with studio effects. King Tubby&#x27;s advantage came from his intimate knowledge with audio gear, and his ability to build his own sound systems and recording studios that were superior to the competition. He became famous for his remixes of recordings made by others, as well as those he recorded in his own studio.

==Other 1970s developments==
Other popular music forms that arose during the 1970s include: Briton (Linton Kwesi Johnson&#x27;s dub poetry); Sly &amp; Robbie&#x27;s rockers reggae, which drew on Augustus Pablo&#x27;s melodica, becoming popular with artists such as The Mighty Diamonds and The Gladiators; Joe Gibbs&#x27; mellower rockers reggae, including music by Culture and Dennis Brown; Burning Spear&#x27;s distinctive style, as represented by the albums &quot;Marcus Garvey&quot; and &quot;Man in the Hills&quot;; and harmonic, spiritually oriented Rasta music like that of The Abyssinians, Black Uhuru and Third World. In 1975, Louisa Mark had a hit with &quot;Caught You in a Lie&quot;, beginning a trend of British performers making romantic, ballad-oriented reggae called lovers rock.

Reggae and ska had a massive influence on British punk rock and new wave bands of the 1970s, such as The Clash, Elvis Costello and the Attractions, The Police, The Slits, and The Ruts. Ska revival bands such as The Specials, Madness and The Selecter developed the 2 Tone genre.

==Dancehall and ragga==
During the 1980s, the most popular music styles in Jamaica were dancehall and ragga. Dancehall is essentially speechifying with musical accompaniment, including a basic drum beat (most often played on electric drums). The lyrics moved away from the political and spiritual lyrics popular in the 1970s and concentrate more on less serious issues ragga is characterized by the use of computerized beats and sequenced melodic track.

Ragga is usually said to have been invented with the song &quot;Under Mi Sleng Teng&quot; by Wayne Smith. Ragga barely edged out dancehall as the dominant form of Jamaican music in the 1980s. DJ Shabba Ranks and vocalist team Chaka Demus and Pliers proved more enduring than the competition, and helped inspire an updated version of the rude boy culture called raggamuffin.

Dancehall was sometimes violent in lyrical content, and several rival performers made headlines with their feuds across Jamaica (most notably Beenie Man versus Bounty Killer). Dancehall emerged from pioneering recordings in the late 1970s by Barrington Levy, with Roots Radics backing and Junjo Lawes as producer. The Roots Radics were the pre-eminent backing band for the dancehall style. Yellowman, Ini Kamoze, Charlie Chaplin and General Echo helped popularize the style along with producers like Sugar Minott.

The 1980s saw a rise in reggae music from outside of Jamaica. During this time, reggae particularly influenced African popular music, where Sonny Okusuns, John Chibadura, Lucky Dube and Alpha Blondy became stars. The 1980s saw the end of the dub era in Jamaica, although dub has remained a popular and influential style in the UK, and to a lesser extent throughout Europe and the US. Dub in the 1980s and 1990s has merged with electronic music.

The late 2000s saw large local success for dancehall artists like Popcaan, Vybz Kartel, Shalkal,Konshens, Mr. Vegas and Mavado. In the next decade, others artists such as Tommy Lee Sparta, Alkaline, and Cashtro Troy, would also rise to the dancehall scene. By the late 2010s, music in Western markets saw influences of dancehall in pop music, including Drake&#x27;s &quot;One Dance&quot; and &quot;Controlla&quot; (2016) and Rihanna&#x27;s &quot;Work&quot; (2016).

==Reggae fusion==
Reggae fusion emerged as a popular subgenre in the late 1990s. It is a mixture of reggae or dancehall with elements of other genres. It is closely related to ragga music. It originated in Jamaica, Reggae fusion artists from Jamaica with a #1 U.S. Billboard Hot 100 hit include Ini Kamoze with &quot;Here Comes the Hotstepper&quot; in 1994, Super Cat (featured on Sugar Ray&#x27;s song &quot;Fly&quot;), Shaggy (2 #1 hits, like &quot;Angel&quot;), Rikrok (featured on Shaggy&#x27;s song &quot;It Wasn&#x27;t Me&quot;), Sean Paul (3 #1 hits, like &quot;Get Busy&quot;), Sean Kingston with &quot;Beautiful Girls&quot; in 2007, and OMI (singer) with &quot;Cheerleader&quot; in 2015. All are from Kingston, except Ini Kamoze, Rikrok, and OMI.

==Non-Rastafarian Jamaican religious music==
The Bongo Nation is a distinct group of Jamaicans possibly descended from the Congo. They are known for Kumina, which refers to both a religion and a form of music. Kumina&#x27;s distinctive drumming style became one of the roots of Rastafarian drumming, itself the source of the distinctive Jamaican rhythm heard in ska, rocksteady and reggae. The modern intertwining of Jamaican religion and music can be traced back to the 1860s, when the Pocomania and Revival Zion churches drew on African traditions, and incorporated music into almost every facet of worship. Later, this trend spread into Hindu communities, resulting in baccra music.

The spread of Rastafari into urban Jamaica in the 1960s transformed the Jamaican music scene, which incorporated drumming (played at grounation ceremonies) and which has led to today&#x27;s popular music. Many of the above-mentioned music and dance have been studied by Rex Nettleford artistic director (retired professor and vice chancellor of The University of the West Indies) and Marjorie Whyle Musical Director (Caribbean Musicologist, pianist, drummer, arranger lecturer at the University of the West Indies). Since 1962, this volunteer company of dancers and musicians have had many of these dances in its core repertoire and have performed worldwide to large audiences, including The British Royal family.

==Other developments==
Other trends included minimalist digital tracks, which began with Dave Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Pepper Seed&quot; in 1995, alongside the return of love balladeers like Beres Hammond. American, British, and European electronic musicians used reggae-oriented beats to create further hybrid electronic music styles. Dub, world music, and electronic music continue to influence music in the 2000s. One of the latest developments is a musical form called Linguay which was founded by record producer Lissant Folkes in 2013.

JaFolk Mix is a term coined by Jamaican musician Joy Fairclough, to mean the mix of Jamaican Folk Music with any foreign and local styles of music and the evolution of a new sound created by their fusion. This is the latest Jamaican Music stylistic development of the late 20th century and 21st century. Jamaican music continues to influence the world&#x27;s music. Many efforts at studying and copying Jamaican music has introduced the world to this new form of music as the copied styles are performed with accents linguistically and musically slanted to that of the home nation in which it is being studied, copied and performed.

<text>Lichenology is the branch of mycology that studies the lichens, symbiotic organisms made up of an intimate symbiotic association of a microscopic alga (or a cyanobacterium) with a filamentous fungus. Lichens are chiefly characterized by this symbiosis. 

Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: mycology, phycology, microbiology and botany. Scholars of lichenology are known as lichenologists. Study of lichens is conducted by both professional and amateur lichenologists.

Methods for species identification include reference to single-access keys on lichens. An example reference work is &quot;Lichens of North America&quot; (2001) by Irwin M. Brodo, Sylvia Sharnoff and Stephen Sharnoff and that book&#x27;s 2016 expansion, &quot;Keys to Lichens of North America: Revised and Expanded&quot; by the same three authors joined by Susan Laurie-Bourque.

A chemical spot test can be used to detect the presence of certain lichen products which can be characteristic of a given lichen species. Some components of certain lichens may also fluoresce under ultraviolet light, providing another form of lichen identification test. 

Lichenologists may also study the growth and growth rate of lichens, lichenometry, the role of lichens in nutrient cycling, the ecological role of lichens in biological soil crusts, the morphology of lichens, their anatomy and physiology, and ethnolichenology topics including the study of edible lichens. As with any other field of study, lichenology has its own set of rules for taxonomic nomenclature and its own set of other terminology.

==History==

===The beginnings===

Lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times. Several species have appeared in the works of Dioscorides, Pliny the Elder and Theophrastus although the studies are not very deep. During the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of spontaneous generation and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored. For centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a French researcher Joseph Pitton de Tournefort in his &quot;Institutiones Rei Herbariae&quot; grouped them into their own genus. He adopted the Latin term lichen, which had already been used by Pliny who had imported it from Theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed. The original meaning of the Greek word λειχήν (leichen) was moss that in its turn derives from the Greek verb λείχω (liekho) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water. In its original use the term signified mosses, liverworts as well as lichens. Some forty years later Dillenius in his &quot;Historia Muscorum&quot; made the first division of the group created by Tournefort separating the sub-families Usnea, Coralloides and Lichens in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen thallus.

After the revolution in taxonomy brought in by Linnaeus and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the Plant Kingdom forming a single group Lichen with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the thallus. The taxonomy of lichens was first intensively investigated by the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius (1757–1819), who is therefore sometimes named the &quot;father of lichenology&quot;. Acharius was a student of Carl Linnaeus. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are:

* &quot;Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus&quot; (1798)
* &quot;Methodus lichenum&quot; (1803)
* &quot;Lichenographia universalis&quot; (1810)
* &quot;Synopsis methodica lichenum&quot; (1814)

Later lichenologists include the American scientists Vernon Ahmadjian and Edward Tuckerman and the Russian evolutionary biologist Konstantin Merezhkovsky, as well as amateurs such as Louisa Collings.

Over the years research shed new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants. A controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction. In these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of Linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs, as in other plants, independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred. Other researchers only considered asexual reproduction by means of Propagules.

===19th century===

Against this background appeared the Swedish botanist Erik Acharius disciple of Linnaeus, who is today considered the father of lichenology, starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering study of Swedish lichens in Lichenographiae Suecicae Prodromus of 1798 or in his Synopsis Methodica Lichenum, Sistens omnes hujus Ordinis Naturalis of 1814. These studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations. In these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as Lichenographia Europaea Reformata published in 1831 by Elias Fries or Enumeratio Critico Lichenum Europaeorum 1850 by Ludwig Schaerer in Germany.

But these works suffer from being superficial and mere lists of species without further physiological studies. It took until the middle of the 19th century for research to catch up using biochemical and physiological methods. In Germany and Johann Bayrhoffer, in France Edmond Tulasne and Camille Montagne, in Russia Fedor Buhse, in England William Allport Leighton and in the United States Edward Tuckerman began to publish works of great scientific importance.

Scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens. In the French publication Annales des Sciences Naturelles in an article of 1852 &quot;Memorie pour servir a l&#x27;Histoire des Lichens Organographique et Physiologique&quot; by Edmond Tulasne, the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified.

These new discoveries were becoming increasingly contradictory for scientists. The apothecium reproductive organ being unique to fungi but absent in other photosynthetic organisms. With improvements in microscopy, algae were identified in the lichen structure, which heightened the contradictions. At first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a symbiotic relation with the fungal part of the thallus. That the algae continued to multiply showed that they were not mere contaminants.

It was Anton de Bary a German mycologist who specialised in phytopathology who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the ascomycetes group by nostoc type algae and others. Successive studies such as those carried out by Andrei Famintsyn and Baranetzky in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus. It was in 1869 that Simon Schwendener demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature. This researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component. In 1873 Jean-Baptiste Edouard Bornet concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely symbiotic. It was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen phenotypes. 

===20th century===

In 1909 the Russian lichenologist Konstantin Mereschkowski presented a research paper &quot;The Theory of two Plasms as the basis of Symbiogenesis, A new study on the Origin of Organisms&quot;, which aims to explain a new theory of Symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work &quot;Nature and Origin of Chromatophores in the Plant Kingdom&quot;. These new ideas can be studied today under the title of the Theory of Endosymbiosis.

Despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the Swiss researcher Eugen A Thomas was able to reproduce in the laboratory the phenotype of the lichen &quot;Cladonia pyxidata&quot; by combining its two identified components.

During the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens. On the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms. There appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology such as Henry Nicollon des Abbayes, William Alfred Weber, Antonina Georgievna Borissova, Irwin M. Brodo, and George Albert Llano.

Lichenology has found applications beyond biology itself in the field of geology in a technique known as lichenometry where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them. Age dating in this way can be absolute or relative because the growth of these organisms can be arrested under various conditions. The technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied. Lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an epilithic lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by Roland Beschel in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years. Growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15–50 mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2–4 mm per year.

The difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens. In 1982 the International Association for Lichenology convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee. The chairman of this committee was the renowned researcher Vernon Ahmadjian. The definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure.

Such a simple a priori definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments. For example, David L. Hawksworth considered the definition imperfect because it is impossible to determine which one thallus is of a specific structure since thalli changed depending upon the substrate and conditions in which they developed. This researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism.

Today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields. Especially important are studies on environmental quality that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment. Lichen is extremely sensitive to various air pollutants, especially to sulphur dioxide, which causes acid rain and prevents water absorption. 

==Lichens in pharmacology==
Although several species of lichen have been used in traditional medicine it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with antibacterial action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to medicine. From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted microbiologist Rufus Paul Burkholder who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus &quot;Usnea&quot; against &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; and &quot;Sarcina lutea&quot;. Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was usnic acid. Something similar occurred with the substance Ramelina synthesised by the lichen &quot;Ramalina reticulata&quot;, nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against Gram negative bacteria such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased ergosterol, usnic acid etc.

Interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of World War II along with the growing interest in all antibiotic substances. In 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of &quot;Cetraria islandica&quot; and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be d-protolichosteric acid and d-1-usnic acid. Further investigations have identified novel antibacterial substances, Alectosarmentin or Atranorin.

Antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial proteins with a subsequent loss of bacterial metabolic capacity. This is possible due to the action of lichen phenolics such as usnic acid derivatives.

From the 1950s the lichen product usnic acid was the object of most antitumour research. These studies revealed some in vitro antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens &quot;Peltigera leucophlebia&quot; and &quot;Collema flaccidum&quot;.

Recent work in the field of applied biochemistry has shown some antiviral activity with some lichen substances. In 1989 K Hirabayashi presented his investigations on inhibitory lichen polysaccharides in HIV infection.

<text>Georg von Peuerbach (also Purbach, Peurbach; ; 30 May 1423 – 8 April 1461) was an Austrian astronomer, poet, mathematician and instrument maker, best known for his streamlined presentation of Ptolemaic astronomy in the &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum.&quot; Peuerbach was instrumental in making astronomy, mathematics and literature simple and accessible for Europeans during the Renaissance and beyond. 

==Biography==
Peuerbach&#x27;s life remains relatively unknown until he enrolled at the University of Vienna in 1446. He was born in the Austrian town of Peuerbach in upper Austria. A horoscope published eighty-nine years after his death places his date of birth specifically on 30 May 1423, though other evidence only indicates that he was born sometime after 1421. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1448.

Georg&#x27;s intellect was discovered by a priest of his hometown, Dr. Heinrich Barucher. Dr. Barucher recognized Peuerbach&#x27;s academic abilities from a young age and put him in contact with the Augustinian provost of Klosterneuburg Monastery, Georg Muestinger. Georg Muestinger taught a course at the University of Vienna entitled &quot;Theoricae Planetarum.&quot; These lectures were the first that Georg von Peuerbach attended at the University of Vienna and inspired him to enroll.

During his time at University of Vienna, Georg received a master of philosophy in 1446 and a second master&#x27;s degree in 1448, studying mathematics under the guidelines of Johann von Gmünden. His curriculum was composed primarily of humanities courses, as was usual at the time. His knowledge of astronomy derived from independent study, possibly from studying under followers of John von Gmünden. During his enrollment, there were no professors of astronomy at the University of Vienna. However, under his tutelage astronomic studies emerged at the University of Vienna throughout the 15th and 16th centuries.

Peuerbach observed the occultation of Jupiter by the Moon in 1451, signifying the beginning of his personal astronomy career. After this point Peuerbach essentially devoted his life to astronomy, he developed tools and theories, and collaborated with his pupil Regiomontanus (Johannes Müller von Königsberg) to make astrology more digestible to common people. Majority of Georg&#x27;s astrological discoveries were made in the last ten years of his life.

Georg Peuerbach traveled through central and southern Europe, most notably in Italy, giving lectures on astronomy. His lectures led to offers of professorships at several universities, including those at Bologna and Padua. During this time he also met Italian astronomer Giovanni Bianchini of Ferrara, perhaps the leading astronomer at the time, and the Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa. He returned to the University of Vienna in 1453, earned his Masters of Arts, and began lecturing on Latin poetry. He is often credited as a leader in reviving classical Greek and Roman literature in arts and sciences.

Peuerbach attended many university lectures that focused on Roman poets, which led to him playing one of the leading roles in the revitalization of classical learning introduced by Aenaes Silvius Piccolomini. Peuerbach eventually followed the advice of the court astrologer to Emperor Friedrich III in Wiener-Nestadt, Johann Nihil, and took the position of court astrologer to the king of Hungary. After being court astrologer for a few years, Peuerbach eventually went on to become imperial astrologer.

While at Vienna in 1454, Peuerbach taught planetary motion to students at the university. Peuerbach&#x27;s lectures were based on Ptolemaic teachings and became so famous that from 1472 they were printed under the title ‘&quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot;‘. 

In 1454 Peuerbach was appointed court astrologer to King Ladislas V of Bohemia and Hungary. It was in this capacity that Peuerbach first met Ladislas&#x27; cousin Frederick who was then serving as guardian to the 14-year-old king and who would later become Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. Ladislas resided primarily in Prague and Vienna, allowing Peuerbach to maintain his position at the University of Vienna. During this time Peuerbach met Regiomontanus, who was then a student at the university. After Regiomontanus graduated in 1452 at the age of 15, he began collaborating extensively with Peuerbach in his astronomical work.
In 1457, following the assassination of two notable political figures, Ladislas fled Vienna and died in 1458. Peurbach did not receive an appointment from either of Ladislas&#x27; two successors. However he was asked to be the &quot;Astronomus caesaris&quot; for Emperor Frederick III, which is the position he held until his death.

Georg von Peuerbach died on 8 April 1461. His work set the path for future scholars, scientists, and astronomers for years to come; Peurbach’s early death was a serious loss to the progress of astronomy, although Regiomontanus, his successor, was able to continue his work.   

==Work==
Peuerbach is best-known for his work &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum,&quot; written in 1454, and published by his disciple Regiomontanus in 1472. &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; presented a version of Claudius Ptolemy geocentric system in a more colloquial and comprehensible way. Based on a series of Peuerbach&#x27;s lectures at Bürgerschule in Vienna that were transcribed by Regiomontanus. The book introduced the &quot;New Planetary Theory of Georg von Peuerbach&quot; based on the already successful Ptolemaic system, this new theory presented the physical realities of eccentric planetary spheres. In his model of the sun Peuerbach removed simple eccentric shells and added partial orbs, some of which were eccentric and some concentric to the center of the world. Similar models for the planets replaced the body of the sun with an epicycle sphere carrying each planet.

Peuerbach ideas replaced &quot;Theorica Planetarum Communis&quot;, a work credited to Gerardus Cremonensis, as the standard university text on astronomy and was studied by many influential astronomers including Nicolaus Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.

In 1457 Peuerbach observed an eclipse and noted that it had occurred 8 minutes earlier than had been predicted by the Alphonsine Tables, the best available astronomical tables at the time. He then computed his own set of eclipse tables, the &quot;Tabulae Eclipsium.&quot; Widely read in manuscript form beginning around 1459 and formally published in 1514, these tables remained highly influential for many years.

Peuerbach wrote various papers on practical mathematics and constructed various astronomical instruments. Most notably, he computed sine tables based on techniques developed by Islamicate mathematicians. Peuerbach&#x27;s work was instrumental in establishing a more modern understanding of mathematics.

In 1460, Cardinal Johannes Bessarion, while visiting Frederick&#x27;s court seeking assistance in a crusade to reclaim Constantinople from the Turks, proposed that Peuerbach and Regiomontanus create a new translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; from the original Greek. Bessarion thought that a shorter and more clearly written version of the work would make a suitable teaching text. Peuerbach accepted the task and worked on it with Regiomontanus until his death in 1461, at which time 6 volumes had been completed. Regiomontanus completed the project, and the final version containing 13 volumes was published in 1496.

== Accomplishments ==

* In February 1453, Georg Von Peuerbach was awarded with the Magister Artium in Vienna.
* Peuerbach began the translation of Ptolemy&#x27;s Almagest from Greek into Latin, a task which was completed and published by his student Regiomontanus in 1496.
* Expanded the Astronomy program at the University of Vienna.
* Influenced many other European astrological and astronomical discoveries with his observations and ideologies

== Legacy ==
Georg von Peuerbach work outlives him because of his ability to communicate astronomy, mathematics and art. His contributions simplified seeming difficult ideas, making them more digestible and inspiring critical thought. Through his tutelage he was able to create an astronomy program at his alma mater, further expanding the understanding of astronomy.

Peuerbach&#x27;s and Regiomontanus&#x27;s contribution expanded the European understanding of astronomy by translating Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; in a book that later influenced Nicolaus Copernicus. Though the work was completed after Peuerbach&#x27;s death in 1461, Regiomontanus carried on with the task and eventually the &quot;Epitome of the Almagest&quot; was published in 1496, nearly 35 years after his teacher’s passing, and 20 years after his own (Regiomontanus died in 1476). This book would go on to be an important reference for Nicholas Copernicus for the creation of his book &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;.

Ironically Nicolaus Copernicus work, and later Sir Issac Newtons disproved many of the ideas that Peuerbach supported while defending the Ptolemaic system, nonetheless his advancement in technology and theory help modernize the study of astronomy.

A Peuerbach&#x27;s input in Regiomontanus&#x27;s trigonometric tables was used by future astronomers in the coming century. Though a fair amount of Peuerbach&#x27;s work is believed to have circulated in academia, his full observations were only published by Johann Schöner nearly a century after Peuerbach&#x27;s death. His &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; would be released in numerous editions between 1472 and 1596, with additions by scholars such as Regiomontanus, Peter Apian, Erasmus Reinhold, and Philip Melanchthon. It is believed that by 1653, at least 56 Latin printings of the text had been published with numerous editions in other languages as well.

Peuerbach’s &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; became one of the most common astronomy textbooks used to train future scholars. He is credited with being instrumental in the European understanding of astronomy and the Ptolemaic system. The descriptions of the solid spheres model (common to the Ptolemaic planetary system) seen in the &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; would remain the accepted view of the nature of the spheres until the time of Tycho Brahe, who disproved the existence of solid spheres. The &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; is also credited with helping to establish much of the technical vocabulary used by astronomers through the seventeenth century.

Peuerbach is also known to have developed and distributed tables that were capable of predicting eclipses of both the sun and the moon, and this practice was continued by Regiomontanus. The manuscript, titled &quot;Tabulae Eclipsium&quot;, saw continued use, as late as Tycho Brahe near the end of the sixteenth century.  He is also believed to have overseen the collection and duplication of numerous astronomical manuscripts. This culminated in the development of a scientific printing press in Nuremberg by Regiomontanus. The printing press was further used to publish astronomical works such as Peuerbach&#x27;s own &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot;, as well as the &quot;Astronomicon&quot; written by the poet Manilius

<text>Lawrence Joseph Ellison (born August 17, 1944) is an American businessman and entrepreneur who co-founded software company Oracle Corporation. He was Oracle&#x27;s chief executive officer from 1977 to 2014 and is now its chief technology officer and executive chairman.

As of February 4, 2025, Ellison is the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to &quot;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&quot;, with an estimated net worth of US$194 billion, and the fourth-wealthiest person in the world according to &quot;Forbes,&quot; with an estimated net worth of $211 billion. Ellison is also known for his ownership of 98% of Lānaʻi, the sixth-largest island in the Hawaiian Islands.

==Early life and education==
Ellison was born on August 17, 1944, in New York City to Florence Spellman, an unwed Jewish mother. His biological father was an Italian-American United States Army Air Corps pilot. After Ellison contracted pneumonia at the age of nine months, his mother gave him to her aunt and uncle for adoption. He did not meet his biological mother again until he was 48.

Ellison moved to Chicago&#x27;s South Shore, then a primarily Jewish middle-class neighborhood. He remembers his adoptive mother, Lillian Spellman Ellison, as warm and loving, in contrast to his austere, unsupportive, and often distant adoptive father, who had chosen the name Ellison to honor his point of entry into the United States, Ellis Island. Louis Ellison was a government employee who had made a small fortune in Chicago real estate, only to lose it during the Great Depression.

Although Ellison was raised in a Reform Jewish home by his adoptive parents, who attended synagogue regularly, he remained a religious skeptic. At age 13, Ellison refused to have a bar mitzvah celebration. Ellison states: &quot;While I think I am religious in one sense, the particular dogmas of Judaism are not dogmas I subscribe to. I don&#x27;t believe that they are real. They&#x27;re interesting stories. They&#x27;re interesting mythology, and I certainly respect people who believe these are literally true, but I don&#x27;t. I see no evidence for this stuff.&quot; Ellison says that his fondness for Israel is not connected to religious sentiments but rather due to the innovative spirit of Israelis in the technology sector.

Ellison attended South Shore High School in Chicago and later was admitted to University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and was enrolled as a pre-med student. At the university, he was named science student of the year. He withdrew without taking final exams after his sophomore year because his adoptive mother had just died. After spending the summer of 1966 in California, he then attended the University of Chicago for one term, where he studied physics and mathematics and also first encountered computer design. He then moved to Berkeley, California, and began his career as a computer programmer for different companies.

==Early career and Oracle==
=== 1977–1994 ===
During the 1970s, after a brief stint at Amdahl Corporation, Ellison began working for Ampex Corporation. His first project included a database for the CIA, code-named &quot;Oracle&quot;. Ellison was inspired by a paper written by Edgar F. Codd on relational database systems called &quot;A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks&quot;. In 1977, he founded Software Development Laboratories (SDL) with two partners and an investment of $2,000; $1,200 of the money was his.

In 1979, the company renamed itself Relational Software, Inc. (RSI). Ellison had heard about the IBM System R database, also based on Codd&#x27;s theories, and wanted Oracle to achieve compatibility with it, but IBM made this impossible by refusing to share System R&#x27;s error codes. The initial release of the Oracle Database in 1979 was called Oracle version 2; there was no Oracle version 1. In 1983, the company officially became Oracle Systems Corporation after its flagship product. In 1990, Oracle laid off 10% of its workforce (about 400 people) because it was losing money. This crisis, which almost resulted in the company&#x27;s bankruptcy, came about because of Oracle&#x27;s &quot;up-front&quot; marketing strategy, in which sales people urged potential customers to buy the largest possible amount of software all at once. The sales people then booked the value of future license sales in the current quarter, thereby increasing their bonuses. This became a problem when the future sales subsequently failed to materialize. Oracle eventually had to restate its earnings twice, and had to settle class-action lawsuits arising from its having overstated its earnings. Ellison would later say that Oracle had made &quot;an incredible business mistake&quot;.

Although IBM dominated the mainframe relational database market with its DB2 and SQL/DS database products, it delayed entering the market for a relational database on Unix and Windows operating systems. This left the door open for Sybase, Oracle, Ingres, Informix, and eventually Microsoft to dominate mid-range systems and microcomputers. Around this time, Oracle fell behind Sybase. From 1990 to 1993, Sybase was the fastest-growing database company and the database industry&#x27;s darling vendor, but soon it fell victim to merger mania. Sybase&#x27;s 1996 merger with Powersoft resulted in a loss of focus on its core database technology. In 1993, Sybase sold the rights to its database software running under the Windows operating system to Microsoft Corporation, which now markets it under the name &quot;SQL Server&quot;.

In his early years at Oracle, Ellison was named an Award Recipient in the High Technology Category for the Ernst and Young Entrepreneur of the Year Program.

=== 1994–2010 ===

In 1994, Informix overtook Sybase and became Oracle&#x27;s most important rival. The intense war between Informix CEO Phil White and Ellison was front-page Silicon Valley news for three years. In April 1997, Informix announced a major revenue shortfall and earnings restatements. Phil White eventually landed in jail, and IBM absorbed Informix in 2001. Also in 1997, Ellison was made a director of Apple Computer after Steve Jobs returned to the company. Ellison resigned in 2002. With the defeat of Informix and of Sybase, Oracle enjoyed years of industry dominance until the rise of Microsoft SQL Server in the late 1990s and IBM&#x27;s acquisition of Informix Software in 2001 to complement their DB2 database. Oracle&#x27;s main competition for new database licenses on UNIX, Linux, and Windows operating systems comes from IBM&#x27;s DB2 and from Microsoft SQL Server. IBM&#x27;s DB2 still dominates the mainframe database market.

In 2005, Ellison agreed to settle a four-year-old insider-trading lawsuit by offering to pay $100 million to charity in Oracle&#x27;s name.

In 2005, Oracle Corporation paid Ellison a $975,000 salary, a $6,500,000 bonus, and other compensation of $955,100. In 2007, Ellison earned a total compensation of $61,180,524, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $8,369,000, and options granted of $50,087,100. In 2008, he earned a total compensation of $84,598,700, which included a base salary of $1,000,000, a cash bonus of $10,779,000, no stock grants, and options granted of $71,372,700. In the year ending May 31, 2009, he made $56.8 million. In 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him as the richest Californian. In April 2009, after a tug-of-war with IBM and Hewlett-Packard, Oracle announced its intent to buy Sun Microsystems. On July 2, 2009, for the fourth year in a row, Oracle&#x27;s board awarded Ellison another 7 million stock options. On August 22, 2009, it was reported that Ellison would be paid only $1 for his base salary for the fiscal year of 2010, down from the $1,000,000 he was paid in fiscal 2009.

=== 2010–present ===
The European Union approved Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 21, 2010, and agreed that Oracle&#x27;s acquisition of Sun &quot;has the potential to revitalize important assets and create new and innovative products&quot;. The Sun acquisition also gave Oracle control of the popular MySQL open source database, which Sun had acquired in 2008. On August 9, 2010, Ellison denounced Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s board for firing CEO Mark Hurd, writing that: &quot;The HP board just made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.&quot; (Ellison and Hurd were close personal friends.) Then on September 6, Oracle hired Mark Hurd as co-president alongside Safra Catz. Ellison remained in his current role at Oracle.

In March 2010, the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires ranked Ellison as the sixth-richest person in the world and as the third-richest American, with an estimated net worth of over $28 billion. On July 27, 2010, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Ellison was the highest-paid executive in the last decade, collecting a total compensation of US$1.84 billion. In September 2011, Ellison was listed on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires as the fifth richest man in the world and was still the third richest American, with a net worth of about $36.5 billion. In September 2012, Ellison was again listed on the &quot;Forbes&quot; list of billionaires as the third richest American citizen, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, with a net worth of $44 billion. In October 2012, he was listed just behind David Hamilton Koch as the eighth richest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison owns stakes in Salesforce.com, NetSuite, Quark Biotechnology Inc. and Astex Pharmaceuticals. In June 2012, Ellison agreed to buy 98 percent of the Hawaiian island of Lānaʻi from David Murdock&#x27;s company, Castle &amp; Cooke. The price was reported to be between $500 million and $600 million. In 2013, according to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Ellison earned $94.6 million. On September 18, 2014, Ellison appointed Mark Hurd to CEO of Oracle from his former position as president; Safra Catz was also made CEO, moving from her former role as CFO. Ellison assumed the positions of chief technology officer and executive chairman.

In November 2016, Oracle bought NetSuite for $9.3 billion. Ellison owned 35% of NetSuite at the time of the purchase making him $3.5 billion personally.

In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated that Ellison was the 4th richest person in tech.

In June 2018, Ellison&#x27;s net worth was about $54.5 billion, according to &quot;Forbes&quot;.

In December 2018, Ellison became a director on the board of Tesla, Inc., after purchasing 3 million shares earlier that year. Ellison left the Tesla Board in August 2022.

As of June 2020, Ellison is said to be the seventh wealthiest person in the world, with a net worth of $66.8 billion.

As of 2022, Ellison owns 42.9 percent of the shares of Oracle Corporation, and as of June 2023, 1.4 percent of the shares of Tesla.

Ellison&#x27;s software startup, Project Ronin, that he co-founded with David Agus and Dave Hodgson closed down in 2024. The company aimed at transforming cancer care whose products were intended to quickly analyze data within electronic medical records systems.

==Philanthropy and other endeavors==
In 1992 Ellison shattered his elbow in a high-speed bicycle crash. After receiving treatment at University of California, Davis, Ellison donated $5 million to seed the Lawrence J. Ellison Musculo-Skeletal Research Center. In 1998, the Lawrence J. Ellison Ambulatory Care Center opened on the Sacramento campus of the UC Davis Medical Center.

To settle an insider trading lawsuit arising from his selling nearly $1 billion of Oracle stock, a court allowed Ellison to donate $100 million to his own charitable foundation without admitting wrongdoing. A California judge refused to allow Oracle to pay Ellison&#x27;s legal fees of $24 million. Ellison&#x27;s lawyer had argued that if Ellison were to pay the fees, that could be construed as an admission of guilt. His charitable donations to Stanford University raised questions about the independence of two Stanford professors who evaluated the case&#x27;s merits for Oracle. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks of 2001, Ellison made a controversial offer to donate software to the federal government that would have enabled it to build and run a national identification database and to issue ID cards.

&quot;Forbes&quot;″ 2004 list of charitable donations made by the wealthiest 400 Americans stated that Ellison had donated $151,092,103, about 1% of his estimated personal wealth. In June 2006, Ellison announced he would not honor his earlier pledge of $115 million to Harvard University, claiming it was due to the departure of former president Lawrence Summers. Oracle spokesman Bob Wynne announced, &quot;It was really Larry Summers&#x27; brainchild and once it looked like Larry Summers was leaving, Larry Ellison reconsidered ... [I]t was Larry Ellison and Larry Summers that had initially come up with this notion.&quot; In 2007 Ellison pledged $500,000 to fortify a community centre in Sderot, Israel, after discovering that the building was not fortified against rocket attacks. Other charitable donations by Ellison include a $10 million donation to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces in 2014. In 2017 Ellison again donated to the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces, this time for $16.6 million. His donation was intended to support the construction of well-being facilities on a new campus for co-ed conscripts.

Ellison was an early investor in Theranos. In August 2010 a report listed Ellison as one of the 40 billionaires who had signed &quot;The Giving Pledge&quot;.

In May 2016 Ellison donated $200 million to the University of Southern California for establishing a cancer research center: the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC. It was renamed the Ellison Institute of Technology, and an additional campus was established in Oxford in 2023 with the intention of providing a scholarship program for twenty students each year.

===Aviation===
Ellison is a licensed pilot who has owned several aircraft. He was cited by the city of San Jose, California, for violating its limits on late-night takeoffs and landings from San Jose Mineta International Airport by planes weighing more than 75,000 pounds (34,019 kg). In January 2000, Ellison sued over the interpretation of the airport rule, contending that his Gulfstream V aircraft &quot;is certified by the manufacturer to fly at two weights: 75,000 pounds, and at 90,000 pounds for heavier loads or long flights requiring more fuel. But the pilot only lands the plane in San Jose when it weighs 75,000 pounds or less, and has the logs to prove it.&quot; US District Judge Jeremy Fogel ruled in Ellison&#x27;s favor in June 2001, calling for a waiver for Ellison&#x27;s jet, but did not invalidate the curfew.

Ellison also owns at least two military jets: the Italian training aircraft SIAI-Marchetti S.211, and a decommissioned Soviet fighter MiG-29, which the US government has refused him permission to import.

===Movie cameo===
Ellison made a brief cameo appearance in the 2010 movie &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;.

===Restaurant===
In July 2013, Ellison opened a restaurant in Malibu named Nikita, which closed in December 2014.

===Tennis===
In 2009, Ellison purchased the Indian Wells Tennis Garden tennis facility in California&#x27;s Coachella Valley and the Indian Wells Masters tournament for $100 million, and has subsequently invested another $100 million into the club.

In 2010, Ellison purchased a 50% share of the BNP Paribas Open tennis tournament.

===Yachting===
With the economic downturn of 2010, Ellison sold his share of &quot;Rising Sun&quot;, the 12th largest yacht in the world, making David Geffen the sole owner. The vessel is long, and reportedly cost over $200million to build. He downsized to &quot;Musashi&quot;, a yacht built by Feadship.

Ellison competes in yachting through Oracle Team USA. Following success racing Maxi yachts, Ellison founded BMW Oracle Racing to compete for the 2003 Louis Vuitton Cup.

In 2002, Ellison&#x27;s Oracle&#x27;s team introduced kite yachting into the America&#x27;s Cup environment. Kite sail flying lasting about thirty minutes was achieved during testing in New Zealand.

BMW Oracle Racing was the &quot;Challenger of Record&quot; on behalf of the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco for the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup in Valencia, Spain, until eliminated from the 2007 Louis Vuitton Cup challenger-selection series in the semi-finals. On February 14, 2010, Ellison&#x27;s yacht &quot;USA 17&quot; won the second race (in the best of three &quot;deed of gift&quot; series) of the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup, after winning the first race two days earlier. Securing a historic victory, Ellison and his BMW Oracle team became the first challengers to win a &quot;deed of gift&quot; match. The Cup returned to American shores for the first time since 1995. Ellison served as a crew member in the second race. Previously, Ellison had filed several legal challenges, through the Golden Gate Yacht Club, against the way that Ernesto Bertarelli (also one of the world&#x27;s richest men) proposed to organize the 33rd America&#x27;s Cup following the 2007 victory of Bertarelli&#x27;s team Alinghi. The races were finally held in February 2010 in Valencia.

On September 25, 2013, Ellison&#x27;s Oracle Team USA defeated Emirates Team New Zealand to win the 34th America&#x27;s Cup in San Francisco Bay, California. Oracle Team USA had been penalized two points in the final for cheating by some team members during the America&#x27;s Cup World Series warm-up events. The Oracle team came from a 1–8 deficit to win 9–8, in what has been called &quot;one of the greatest comebacks in sports history&quot;.

In 2019, Ellison, in conjunction with Russell Coutts, started the SailGP international racing series. The series used F50 foiling catamarans, the fastest class of boat in history with regattas held across the globe. Ellison committed to five years of funding to support the series until it could become self sustaining. The first season was successful with global audiences of over 1.8 billion.

==Political involvement==

Ellison was critical of NSA whistle-blower Edward Snowden, saying that &quot;Snowden had yet to identify a single person who had been &#x27;wrongly injured&#x27; by the NSA&#x27;s data collection&quot;. In 2012, he donated to both Democratic and Republican politicians, and in late 2014 hosted Republican senator Rand Paul at a fundraiser at his home.

Ellison was one of the top donors to Conservative Solutions PAC, a super PAC supporting Marco Rubio&#x27;s 2016 presidential bid. As of February 2016, Ellison had given $4 million overall to the PAC. In 2020, Ellison allowed president Donald Trump to have a fundraiser at his Rancho Mirage estate, but Ellison was not present. In January 2022, Ellison donated $15 million to the Opportunity Matters Fund super PAC associated with Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC), which is one of the most significant financial contributions of the 2022 election cycle.

&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported in May 2022 that Ellison participated in a conference call days after the 2020 presidential election that focused on strategies for challenging the legitimacy of the vote. Other participants on the call included Fox News host Sean Hannity, Senator Lindsey Graham, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow and James Bopp, an attorney for True the Vote. The &quot;Post&quot; cited court documents and a participant on the call.

In January 2025, Ellison joined Sam Altman of OpenAI and Masayoshi Son of Softbank at the White House to announce The Stargate Project.

==Support for archaeological operations in Jerusalem and links with Netanyahu==

According to reports in 2019, Larry Ellison has contributed to funding an archaeological excavation project in East Jerusalem that received criticism from Palestinians as well as Israeli peace activists and some archaeologists. Additionally, in 2019 a $1 billion lawsuit was filed against several Israel supporters, including Ellison. The lawsuit accused Ellison and others of conspiring to ethnically cleanse Palestinians from Israeli-occupied territories, committing war crimes, and funding genocide. The case was dismissed in February 2024.

Ellison reportedly lobbied Israeli mogul Arnon Milchan to drop his lawyer so that Netanyahu, implicated in one of his corruption cases, could hire him. It was also revealed in 2021 that Ellison offered Netanyahu a post at Oracle.

==Recognition==
In 1997, Ellison received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2013, Ellison was inducted into the Bay Area Business Hall of Fame.

In 2019, the Lawrence J. Ellison Institute for Transformative Medicine of USC honored Ellison with the first Rebels With A Cause Award in recognition of his generous support through the years.

Ellison was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2024.

==Personal life==
===Marriages===
Ellison has been married six times:

# Ellison married Adda Quinn in 1967. They divorced in 1974. 
# Ellison married Nancy Wheeler Jenkins shortly after meeting her in late 1976. In 1978, the couple divorced and Wheeler sold back her shares in SDL to Ellison for $500. 
# Ellison was married to Barbara Boothe from 1983 to 1986. Boothe was a former receptionist at RSI. They had two children, David and Megan, who are film producers at Skydance Media and Annapurna Pictures, respectively. 
# On December 18, 2003, Ellison married Melanie Craft, a romance novelist, at his Woodside estate. Ellison&#x27;s friend Steve Jobs, former CEO and co-founder of Apple Inc., was the official wedding photographer, and Representative Tom Lantos officiated. They divorced in 2010. 
# From 2010 until 2020, Ellison was in a relationship and then fifth marriage with Ukrainian-American model and actress Nikita Kahn. They divorced in 2020.
# As of 2024, Ellison is married to Jolin Ellison, an alumna of the University of Michigan.

===Health===
Ellison abstains from alcohol and drugs, stating that &quot;I can&#x27;t stand anything that clouds my mind.&quot;

===Cars===
Ellison owns many exotic cars, including an Audi R8 and a McLaren F1. His favorite is the Acura NSX, which he gave as gifts each year during its production. Ellison is also reportedly the owner of a Lexus LFA.

===Homes===
Ellison styled his estimated $110 million Woodside, California, estate after feudal Japanese architecture, complete with a man-made lake and an extensive seismic retrofit. In 2004 and 2005 he purchased more than twelve properties in Malibu, California, worth more than $180 million. The $65 million Ellison spent on five contiguous lots at Malibu&#x27;s Carbon Beach made this the most costly residential transaction in United States history until banker Ronald Perelman sold his Palm Beach, Florida, compound for $70 million later that same year. The entertainment system at his Pacific Heights home cost $1 million, and includes a rock concert-sized video projector at one end of a drained swimming pool, using the gaping hole as a giant subwoofer.

In early 2010, Ellison purchased the Astors&#x27; Beechwood Mansion – formerly the summer home of the Astor family – in Newport, Rhode Island, for $10.5 million.

In 2011 he purchased the 249-acre Porcupine Creek Estate and private golf course in Rancho Mirage, California, for $42.9 million. The property was formerly the home of Yellowstone Club founders Edra and Tim Blixseth, and was sold to Ellison by creditors following their divorce and bankruptcy.

In December 2020, he left California and moved to Lānaʻi, of which he owns 98%.

In 2022, Ellison bought a 22-acre property in Manalapan, Florida for $173 million. He purchased it from Jim Clark, who in turn had acquired it from the Ziff family. It is the most expensive residential property purchase in Florida history.

<text>A lichen ( , ) is a hybrid colony of algae or cyanobacteria living symbiotically among filaments of multiple fungi species, along with yeasts and bacteria embedded in the cortex or &quot;skin&quot;, in a mutualistic relationship. Lichens are the lifeform that first brought the term symbiosis (as &quot;Symbiotismus&quot;) into biological context.

Lichens have since been recognized as important actors in nutrient cycling and producers which many higher trophic feeders feed on, such as reindeer, gastropods, nematodes, mites, and springtails. Lichens have properties different from those of their component organisms. They come in many colors, sizes, and forms and are sometimes plant-like, but are not plants. They may have tiny, leafless branches (fruticose); flat leaf-like structures (foliose); grow crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint (crustose); have a powder-like appearance (leprose); or other growth forms.

A &quot;macrolichen&quot; is a lichen that is either bush-like or leafy; all other lichens are termed &quot;microlichens&quot;. Here, &quot;macro&quot; and &quot;micro&quot; do not refer to size, but to the growth form. Common names for lichens may contain the word &quot;moss&quot; (e.g., &quot;reindeer moss&quot;, &quot;Iceland moss&quot;), and lichens may superficially look like and grow with mosses, but they are not closely related to mosses or any plant. Lichens do not have roots that absorb water and nutrients as plants do, but like plants, they produce their own energy by photosynthesis. Instead, lichen absorb nutrients from rainwater and the air. When they grow on plants, they do not live as parasites, but instead use the plant&#x27;s surface as a substrate.

Lichens occur from sea level to high alpine elevations, in many environmental conditions, and can grow on almost any surface. They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, mosses, or other lichens and hanging from branches &quot;living on thin air&quot; (epiphytes) in rainforests and in temperate woodland. They grow on rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, exposed soil surfaces, rubber, bones, and in the soil as part of biological soil crusts. Various lichens have adapted to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. They can even live inside solid rock, growing between the grains (endolithic).

There are about 20,000 known species. Some lichens have lost the ability to reproduce sexually, yet continue to speciate. They can be seen as being relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems, where the fungi, algae, or cyanobacteria have the potential to engage with other microorganisms in a functioning system that may evolve as an even more complex composite organism. Lichens may be long-lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living things. They are among the first living things to grow on fresh rock exposed after an event such as a landslide. The long life-span and slow and regular growth rate of some species can be used to date events (lichenometry). Lichens are a keystone species in many ecosystems and benefit trees and birds.

==Etymology and pronunciation==
The English word &quot;lichen&quot; derives from the Greek (&quot;tree moss, lichen, lichen-like eruption on skin&quot;) via Latin . The Greek noun, which literally means &quot;licker&quot;, derives from the verb , &quot;to lick&quot;. In American English, &quot;lichen&quot; is pronounced the same as the verb &quot;liken&quot; (). In British English, both this pronunciation and one rhyming with &quot;kitchen&quot; () are used.

== Anatomy and morphology ==
=== Growth forms ===

Lichens grow in a wide range of shapes and forms; this external appearance is known as their morphology. The shape of a lichen is usually determined by the organization of the fungal filaments. The nonreproductive tissues, or vegetative body parts, are called the &quot;thallus&quot;. Lichens are grouped by thallus type, since the thallus is usually the most visually prominent part of the lichen. Thallus growth forms typically correspond to a few basic internal structure types. Common names for lichens often come from a growth form or color that is typical of a lichen genus.

Common groupings of lichen thallus growth forms are:
# fruticose – growing like a tuft or multiple-branched leafless mini-shrub, upright or hanging down, 3-dimensional branches with nearly round cross section (terete) or flattened
# foliose – growing in 2-dimensional, flat, leaf-like lobes
# crustose – crust-like, adhering tightly to a surface (substrate) like a thick coat of paint
# squamulose – formed of small leaf-like scales crustose below but free at the tips
# leprose – powdery
# gelatinous – jelly-like
# filamentous – stringy or like matted hair
# byssoid – wispy, like teased wool
# structureless

There are variations in growth types in a single lichen species, grey areas between the growth type descriptions, and overlapping between growth types, so some authors might describe lichens using different growth type descriptions.

When a crustose lichen gets old, the center may start to crack up like old-dried paint, old-broken asphalt paving, or like the polygonal &quot;islands&quot; of cracked-up mud in a dried lakebed. This is called being rimose or areolate, and the &quot;island&quot; pieces separated by the cracks are called areolas. The areolas appear separated, but are (or were) connected by an underlying prothallus or hypothallus. When a crustose lichen grows from a center and appears to radiate out, it is called crustose placodioid. When the edges of the areolas lift up from the substrate, it is called squamulose.

These growth form groups are not precisely defined. Foliose lichens may sometimes branch and appear to be fruticose. Fruticose lichens may have flattened branching parts and appear leafy. Squamulose lichens may appear where the edges lift up. Gelatinous lichens may appear leafy when dry.

The thallus is not always the part of the lichen that is most visually noticeable. Some lichens can grow &quot;inside&quot; solid rock between the grains (endolithic lichens), with only the sexual fruiting part visible growing outside the rock. These may be dramatic in color or appearance. Forms of these sexual parts are not in the above growth form categories. The most visually noticeable reproductive parts are often circular, raised, plate-like or disc-like outgrowths, with crinkly edges, and are described in sections below.

=== Color ===

Lichens come in many colors. Coloration is usually determined by the photosynthetic component. Special pigments, such as yellow usnic acid, give lichens a variety of colors, including reds, oranges, yellows, and browns, especially in exposed, dry habitats. In the absence of special pigments, lichens are usually bright green to olive gray when wet, gray or grayish-green to brown when dry. This is because moisture causes the surface skin (cortex) to become more transparent, exposing the green photobiont layer. Different colored lichens covering large areas of exposed rock surfaces, or lichens covering or hanging from bark can be a spectacular display when the patches of diverse colors &quot;come to life&quot; or &quot;glow&quot; in brilliant displays following rain.

Different colored lichens may inhabit different adjacent sections of a rock face, depending on the angle of exposure to light. Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating much of the surface of the visual landscape in forests and natural places, such as the vertical &quot;paint&quot; covering the vast rock faces of Yosemite National Park.

Color is used in identification. The color of a lichen changes depending on whether the lichen is wet or dry. Color descriptions used for identification are based on the color that shows when the lichen is dry. Dry lichens with a cyanobacterium as the photosynthetic partner tend to be dark grey, brown, or black.

The underside of the leaf-like lobes of foliose lichens is a different color from the top side (dorsiventral), often brown or black, sometimes white. A fruticose lichen may have flattened &quot;branches&quot;, appearing similar to a foliose lichen, but the underside of a leaf-like structure on a fruticose lichen is the &quot;same&quot; color as the top side. The leaf-like lobes of a foliose lichen may branch, giving the appearance of a fruticose lichen, but the underside will be a &quot;different&quot; color from the top side.

The sheen on some jelly-like gelatinous lichens is created by mucilaginous secretions.

=== Internal structure ===

A lichen consists of a simple photosynthesizing organism, usually a green alga or cyanobacterium, surrounded by filaments of a fungus. Generally, most of a lichen&#x27;s bulk is made of interwoven fungal filaments, but this is reversed in filamentous and gelatinous lichens. The fungus is called a &quot;mycobiont&quot;. The photosynthesizing organism is called a &quot;photobiont&quot;. Algal photobionts are called &quot;phycobionts&quot;. Cyanobacteria photobionts are called &quot;cyanobionts&quot;.

The part of a lichen that is not involved in reproduction, the &quot;body&quot; or &quot;vegetative tissue&quot; of a lichen, is called the &quot;thallus&quot;. The thallus form is very different from any form where the fungus or alga are growing separately. The thallus is made up of filaments of the fungus called &quot;hyphae&quot;. The filaments grow by branching then rejoining to create a mesh, which is called being &quot;anastomosed&quot;. The mesh of fungal filaments may be dense or loose.

Generally, the fungal mesh surrounds the algal or cyanobacterial cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues that are unique to lichen associations. The thallus may or may not have a protective &quot;skin&quot; of densely packed fungal filaments, often containing a second fungal species, which is called a &quot;cortex.&quot; Fruticose lichens have one cortex layer wrapping around the &quot;branches&quot;. Foliose lichens have an upper cortex on the top side of the &quot;leaf&quot;, and a separate lower cortex on the bottom side. Crustose and squamulose lichens have only an upper cortex, with the &quot;inside&quot; of the lichen in direct contact with the surface they grow on (the &quot;substrate&quot;). Even if the edges peel up from the substrate and appear flat and leaf-like, they lack a lower cortex, unlike foliose lichens. Filamentous, byssoid, leprose, gelatinous, and other lichens do not have a cortex; in other words, they are ecorticate.

Fruticose, foliose, crustose, and squamulose lichens generally have up to three different types of tissue, differentiated by having different densities of fungal filaments. The top layer, where the lichen contacts the environment, is called a &quot;cortex&quot;. The cortex is made of densely tightly woven, packed, and glued together (agglutinated) fungal filaments. The dense packing makes the cortex act like a protective &quot;skin&quot;, keeping other organisms out, and reducing the intensity of sunlight on the layers below. The cortex layer can be up to several hundred micrometers (μm) in thickness (less than a millimeter). The cortex may be further topped by an epicortex of secretions, not cells, 0.6–1 μm thick in some lichens. This secretion layer may or may not have pores.

Below the cortex layer is a layer called the &quot;photobiontic layer&quot; or &quot;symbiont layer&quot;. The symbiont layer has less densely packed fungal filaments, with the photosynthetic partner embedded in them. The less dense packing allows air circulation during photosynthesis, similar to the anatomy of a leaf. Each cell or group of cells of the photobiont is usually individually wrapped by hyphae, and in some cases penetrated by a haustorium. In crustose and foliose lichens, algae in the photobiontic layer are diffuse among the fungal filaments, decreasing in gradation into the layer below. In fruticose lichens, the photobiontic layer is sharply distinct from the layer below.

The layer beneath the symbiont layer is called the &quot;medulla&quot;. The medulla is less densely packed with fungal filaments than the layers above. In foliose lichens, as in &quot;Peltigera&quot;, there is usually another densely packed layer of fungal filaments called the lower cortex. Root-like fungal structures called &quot;rhizines&quot; (usually) grow from the lower cortex to attach or anchor the lichen to the substrate. Fruticose lichens have a single cortex wrapping all the way around the &quot;stems&quot; and &quot;branches&quot;. The medulla is the lowest layer, and may form a cottony white inner core for the branchlike thallus, or it may be hollow. Crustose and squamulose lichens lack a lower cortex, and the medulla is in direct contact with the substrate that the lichen grows on.

In crustose areolate lichens, the edges of the areolas peel up from the substrate and appear leafy. In squamulose lichens the part of the lichen thallus that is not attached to the substrate may also appear leafy. But these leafy parts lack a lower cortex, which distinguishes crustose and squamulose lichens from foliose lichens. Conversely, foliose lichens may appear flattened against the substrate like a crustose lichen, but most of the leaf-like lobes can be lifted up from the substrate because it is separated from it by a tightly packed lower cortex.

Gelatinous, byssoid, and leprose lichens lack a cortex (are ecorticate), and generally have only undifferentiated tissue, similar to only having a symbiont layer.

In lichens that include both green algal &quot;and&quot; cyanobacterial symbionts, the cyanobacteria may be held on the upper or lower surface in small pustules called &quot;cephalodia&quot;.

&quot;Pruinia&quot; is a whitish coating on top of an upper surface. An &quot;epinecral layer&quot; is &quot;a layer of horny dead fungal hyphae with indistinct lumina in or near the cortex above the algal layer&quot;.

In August 2016, it was reported that some macrolichens have more than one species of fungus in their tissues.

==Physiology==

=== Symbiotic relation ===


A lichen is a composite organism that emerges from algae or cyanobacteria living among the filaments (hyphae) of the fungi in a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. The fungi benefit from the carbohydrates produced by the algae or cyanobacteria via photosynthesis. The algae or cyanobacteria benefit by being protected from the environment by the filaments of the fungi, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it. Although some photosynthetic partners in a lichen can survive outside the lichen, the lichen symbiotic association extends the ecological range of both partners, whereby most descriptions of lichen associations describe them as symbiotic. Both partners gain water and mineral nutrients mainly from the atmosphere, through rain and dust. The fungal partner protects the alga by retaining water, serving as a larger capture area for mineral nutrients and, in some cases, provides minerals obtained from the substrate. If a cyanobacterium is present, as a primary partner or another symbiont in addition to a green alga as in certain tripartite lichens, they can fix atmospheric nitrogen, complementing the activities of the green alga.

In three different lineages the fungal partner has independently lost the mitochondrial gene atp9, which has key functions in mitochondrial energy production. The loss makes the fungi completely dependent on their symbionts.

The algal or cyanobacterial cells are photosynthetic and, as in plants, they reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic carbon sugars to feed both symbionts. Phycobionts (algae) produce sugar alcohols (ribitol, sorbitol, and erythritol), which are absorbed by the mycobiont (fungus). Cyanobionts produce glucose. Lichenized fungal cells can make the photobiont &quot;leak&quot; out the products of photosynthesis, where they can then be absorbed by the fungus.

It appears many, probably the majority, of lichen also live in a symbiotic relationship with an order of basidiomycete yeasts called Cyphobasidiales. The absence of this third partner could explain why growing lichen in the laboratory is difficult. The yeast cells are responsible for the formation of the characteristic cortex of the lichen thallus, and could also be important for its shape. An example of this lichen-yeast symbiosis is the North American beard-like lichens.

The lichen combination of alga or cyanobacterium with a fungus has a very different form (morphology), physiology, and biochemistry than the component fungus, alga, or cyanobacterium growing by itself, naturally or in culture. The body (thallus) of most lichens is different from those of either the fungus or alga growing separately. When grown in the laboratory in the absence of its photobiont, a lichen fungus develops as a structureless, undifferentiated mass of fungal filaments (hyphae). If combined with its photobiont under appropriate conditions, its characteristic form associated with the photobiont emerges, in the process called morphogenesis. In a few remarkable cases, a single lichen fungus can develop into two very different lichen forms when associating with either a green algal or a cyanobacterial symbiont. Quite naturally, these alternative forms were at first considered to be different species, until they were found growing in a conjoined manner.

Evidence that lichens are examples of successful symbiosis is the fact that lichens can be found in almost every habitat and geographic area on the planet. Two species in two genera of green algae are found in over 35% of all lichens, but can only rarely be found living on their own outside of a lichen.

In a case where one fungal partner simultaneously had two green algae partners that outperform each other in different climates, this might indicate having more than one photosynthetic partner at the same time might enable the lichen to exist in a wider range of habitats and geographic locations.

Phycobionts can have a net output of sugars with only water vapor. The thallus must be saturated with liquid water for cyanobionts to photosynthesize.

Algae produce sugars that are absorbed by the fungus by diffusion into special fungal hyphae called appressoria or haustoria in contact with the wall of the algal cells. The appressoria or haustoria may produce a substance that increases permeability of the algal cell walls, and may penetrate the walls. The algae may contribute up to 80% of their sugar production to the fungus.

===Ecology===
Lichen associations may be examples of mutualism or commensalism, but the lichen relationship can be considered parasitic under circumstances where the photosynthetic partner can exist in nature independently of the fungal partner, but not vice versa. Photobiont cells are routinely destroyed in the course of nutrient exchange. The association continues because reproduction of the photobiont cells matches the rate at which they are destroyed. The fungus surrounds the algal cells, often enclosing them within complex fungal tissues unique to lichen associations. In many species the fungus penetrates the algal cell wall, forming penetration pegs (haustoria) similar to those produced by pathogenic fungi that feed on a host. Cyanobacteria in laboratory settings can grow faster when they are alone rather than when they are part of a lichen.

====Miniature ecosystem and holobiont theory====
Symbiosis in lichens is so well-balanced that lichens have been considered to be relatively self-contained miniature ecosystems in and of themselves. It is thought that lichens may be even more complex symbiotic systems that include non-photosynthetic bacterial communities performing other functions as partners in a holobiont.

Many lichens are very sensitive to environmental disturbances and can be used to cheaply assess air pollution, ozone depletion, and metal contamination. Lichens have been used in making dyes, perfumes (oakmoss), and in traditional medicines. A few lichen species are eaten by insects or larger animals, such as reindeer. Lichens are widely used as environmental indicators or bio-indicators. When air is very badly polluted with sulphur dioxide, there may be no lichens present; only some green algae can tolerate those conditions. If the air is clean, then shrubby, hairy and leafy lichens become abundant. A few lichen species can tolerate fairly high levels of pollution, and are commonly found in urban areas, on pavements, walls and tree bark. The most sensitive lichens are shrubby and leafy, while the most tolerant lichens are all crusty in appearance. Since industrialisation, many of the shrubby and leafy lichens such as &quot;Ramalina&quot;, &quot;Usnea&quot; and &quot;Lobaria&quot; species have very limited ranges, often being confined to the areas which have the cleanest air.

====Lichenicolous fungi====
Some fungi can only be found living &quot;on&quot; lichens as obligate parasites. These are referred to as lichenicolous fungi, and are a different species from the fungus living inside the lichen; thus they are not considered to be part of the lichen.

===Reaction to water===
Moisture makes the cortex become more transparent. This way, the algae can conduct photosynthesis when moisture is available, and is protected at other times. When the cortex is more transparent, the algae show more clearly and the lichen looks greener.

===Metabolites, metabolite structures and bioactivity===
Lichens can show intense antioxidant activity. Secondary metabolites are often deposited as crystals in the apoplast. Secondary metabolites are thought to play a role in preference for some substrates over others.

=== Growth rate ===
Lichens often have a regular but very slow growth rate of less than a millimeter per year.

In crustose lichens, the area along the margin is where the most active growth is taking place. Most crustose lichens grow only 1–2 mm in diameter per year.

=== Life span ===
Lichens may be long-lived, with some considered to be among the oldest living organisms. Lifespan is difficult to measure because what defines the &quot;same&quot; individual lichen is not precise. Lichens grow by vegetatively breaking off a piece, which may or may not be defined as the &quot;same&quot; lichen, and two lichens can merge, then becoming the &quot;same&quot; lichen. One specimen of &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; on East Baffin Island has an estimated age of 9500 years. Thalli of &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; and &quot;Rhizocarpon eupetraeoides&quot;/&quot;inarense&quot; in the central Brooks Range of northern Alaska have been given a maximum possible age of 10,000–11,500 years.

===Response to environmental stress===
Unlike simple dehydration in plants and animals, lichens may experience a &quot;complete&quot; loss of body water in dry periods. Lichens are capable of surviving extremely low levels of water content (poikilohydric). They quickly absorb water when it becomes available again, becoming soft and fleshy.

In tests, lichen survived and showed remarkable results on the adaptation capacity of photosynthetic activity within the simulation time of 34 days under Martian conditions in the Mars Simulation Laboratory (MSL) maintained by the German Aerospace Center (DLR).

The European Space Agency has discovered that lichens can survive unprotected in space. In an experiment led by Leopoldo Sancho from the Complutense University of Madrid, two species of lichen—&quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot; and &quot;Rusavskia elegans&quot;—were sealed in a capsule and launched on a Russian Soyuz rocket 31 May 2005. Once in orbit, the capsules were opened and the lichens were directly exposed to the vacuum of space with its widely fluctuating temperatures and cosmic radiation. After 15 days, the lichens were brought back to earth and were found to be unchanged in their ability to photosynthesize.

== Reproduction and dispersal ==

===Vegetative reproduction===

Many lichens reproduce asexually, either by a piece breaking off and growing on its own (vegetative reproduction) or through the dispersal of diaspores containing a few algal cells surrounded by fungal cells. Because of the relative lack of differentiation in the thallus, the line between diaspore formation and vegetative reproduction is often blurred. Fruticose lichens can fragment, and new lichens can grow from the fragment (vegetative reproduction). Many lichens break up into fragments when they dry, dispersing themselves by wind action, to resume growth when moisture returns. &quot;Soredia&quot; (singular: &quot;soredium&quot;) are small groups of algal cells surrounded by fungal filaments that form in structures called soralia, from which the soredia can be dispersed by wind. &quot;Isidia&quot; (singular: &quot;isidium&quot;) are branched, spiny, elongated, outgrowths from the thallus that break off for mechanical dispersal. Lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called &quot;fringe species&quot; rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the &quot;core species&quot;.

===Sexual reproduction===
Structures involved in reproduction often appear as discs, bumps, or squiggly lines on the surface of the thallus. Though it has been argued that sexual reproduction in photobionts is selected against, there is strong evidence that suggests meiotic activities (sexual reproduction) in &quot;Trebouxia&quot;. Many lichen fungi reproduce sexually like other fungi, producing spores formed by meiosis and fusion of gametes. Following dispersal, such fungal spores must meet with a compatible algal partner before a functional lichen can form.

Some lichen fungi belong to the phylum Basidiomycota (&quot;basidiolichens&quot;) and produce mushroom-like reproductive structures resembling those of their nonlichenized relatives.

Most lichen fungi belong to Ascomycetes (&quot;ascolichens&quot;). Among the ascolichens, spores are produced in spore-producing structures called &quot;ascomata&quot;. The most common types of ascomata are the &quot;apothecium&quot; (plural: apothecia) and &quot;perithecium&quot; (plural: perithecia). Apothecia are usually cups or plate-like discs located on the top surface of the lichen thallus. When apothecia are shaped like squiggly line segments instead of like discs, they are called &quot;lirellae&quot;. Perithecia are shaped like flasks that are immersed in the lichen thallus tissue, which has a small hole for the spores to escape the flask, and appear like black dots on the lichen surface.

The three most common spore body types are raised discs called &quot;apothecia&quot; (singular: apothecium), bottle-like cups with a small hole at the top called &quot;perithecia&quot; (singular: perithecium), and &quot;pycnidia&quot; (singular: pycnidium), shaped like perithecia but without asci (an ascus is the structure that contains and releases the sexual spores in fungi of the Ascomycota).

The apothecium has a layer of exposed spore-producing cells called &quot;asci&quot; (singular: ascus), and is usually a different color from the thallus tissue. When the apothecium has an outer margin, the margin is called the &quot;exciple&quot;. When the exciple has a color similar to colored thallus tissue the apothecium or lichen is called &quot;lecanorine&quot;, meaning similar to members of the genus &quot;Lecanora&quot;. When the exciple is blackened like carbon it is called &quot;lecideine&quot; meaning similar to members of the genus &quot;Lecidea&quot;. When the margin is pale or colorless it is called &quot;biatorine&quot;.
A &quot;podetium&quot; (plural: podetia) is a lichenized stalk-like structure of the fruiting body rising from the thallus, associated with some fungi that produce a fungal apothecium. Since it is part of the reproductive tissue, podetia are not considered part of the main body (thallus), but may be visually prominent. The podetium may be branched, and sometimes cup-like. They usually bear the fungal pycnidia or apothecia or both. Many lichens have apothecia that are visible to the naked eye.

Most lichens produce abundant sexual structures. Many species appear to disperse only by sexual spores. For example, the crustose lichens &quot;Graphis scripta&quot; and &quot;Ochrolechia parella&quot; produce no symbiotic vegetative propagules. Instead, the lichen-forming fungi of these species reproduce sexually by self-fertilization (i.e. they are homothallic). This breeding system may enable successful reproduction in harsh environments.

&quot;Mazaedia&quot; (singular: mazaedium) are apothecia shaped like a dressmaker&#x27;s pin in pin lichens, where the fruiting body is a brown or black mass of loose ascospores enclosed by a cup-shaped exciple, which sits on top of a tiny stalk.

== Taxonomy and classification ==
Lichens are classified by the fungal component. Lichen species are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus species in the lichen. Lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. The alga bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to that of the lichen or fungus. There are about 20,000 identified lichen species, and taxonomists have estimated that the total number of lichen species (including those yet undiscovered) might be as high as 28,000. Nearly 20% of known fungal species are associated with lichens.

&quot;Lichenized fungus&quot; may refer to the entire lichen, or to just the fungus. This may cause confusion without context. A particular fungus species may form lichens with different algae species, giving rise to what appear to be different lichen species, but which are still classified (as of 2014) as the same lichen species.

Formerly, some lichen taxonomists placed lichens in their own division, the &quot;Mycophycophyta&quot;, but this practice is no longer accepted because the components belong to separate lineages. Neither the ascolichens nor the basidiolichens form monophyletic lineages in their respective fungal phyla, but they do form several major solely or primarily lichen-forming groups within each phylum. Even more unusual than basidiolichens is the fungus &quot;Geosiphon pyriforme&quot;, a member of the Glomeromycota that is unique in that it encloses a cyanobacterial symbiont inside its cells. &quot;Geosiphon&quot; is not usually considered to be a lichen, and its peculiar symbiosis was not recognized for many years. The genus is more closely allied to endomycorrhizal genera. Fungi from Verrucariales also form marine lichens with the brown algae &quot;Petroderma maculiforme&quot;, and have a symbiotic relationship with seaweed (such as rockweed) and &quot;Blidingia minima&quot;, where the algae are the dominant components. The fungi is thought to help the rockweeds to resist desiccation when exposed to air. In addition, lichens can also use yellow-green algae (&quot;Heterococcus&quot;) as their symbiotic partner.

Lichens independently emerged from fungi associating with algae and cyanobacteria multiple times throughout history.
=== Fungi ===
The fungal component of a lichen is called the &quot;mycobiont&quot;. The mycobiont may be an Ascomycete or Basidiomycete. The associated lichens are called either ascolichens or basidiolichens, respectively. Living as a symbiont in a lichen appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients, since about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life.

Thalli produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners may be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. But the same mycobiont with different photobionts may also produce very different growth forms. Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species.

Although each lichen thallus generally appears homogeneous, some evidence seems to suggest that the fungal component may consist of more than one genetic individual of that species.

Two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.

The following table lists the orders and families of fungi that include lichen-forming species.
===Photobionts===

The photosynthetic partner in a lichen is called a &quot;photobiont&quot;. The photobionts in lichens come from a variety of simple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In the majority of lichens the photobiont is a green alga (Chlorophyta) or a cyanobacterium. In some lichens both types are present; in such cases, the alga is typically the primary partner, with the cyanobacteria being located in cryptic pockets. Algal photobionts are called &quot;phycobionts&quot;, while cyanobacterial photobionts are called &quot;cyanobionts&quot;. About 90% of all known lichens have phycobionts, and about 10% have cyanobionts. Approximately 100 species of photosynthetic partners from 40 genera and five distinct classes (prokaryotic: Cyanophyceae; eukaryotic: Trebouxiophyceae, Phaeophyceae, Chlorophyceae) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.

Common algal photobionts are from the genera &quot;Trebouxia&quot;, &quot;Trentepohlia&quot;, &quot;Pseudotrebouxia&quot;, or &quot;Myrmecia&quot;. &quot;Trebouxia&quot; is the most common genus of green algae in lichens, occurring in about 40% of all lichens. &quot;Trebouxioid&quot; means either a photobiont that is in the genus &quot;Trebouxia&quot;, or resembles a member of that genus, and is therefore presumably a member of the class Trebouxiophyceae. The second most commonly represented green alga genus is &quot;Trentepohlia&quot;. Overall, about 100 species of eukaryotes are known to occur as photobionts in lichens. All the algae are probably able to exist independently in nature as well as in the lichen.

A &quot;cyanolichen&quot; is a lichen with a cyanobacterium as its main photosynthetic component (photobiont). Most cyanolichen are also ascolichens, but a few basidiolichen like Dictyonema and Acantholichen have cyanobacteria as their partner.

The most commonly occurring cyanobacterium genus is &quot;Nostoc&quot;. Other common cyanobacterium photobionts are from &quot;Scytonema&quot;. Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have limestone as the substrate. Another cyanolichen group, the jelly lichens of the genera &quot;Collema&quot; or &quot;Leptogium&quot; are gelatinous and live on moist soils. Another group of large and foliose species including &quot;Peltigera&quot;, &quot;Lobaria&quot;, and &quot;Degelia&quot; are grey-blue, especially when dampened or wet. Many of these characterize the Lobarion communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the Celtic rain forest. Strains of cyanobacteria found in various cyanolichens are often closely related to one another. They differ from the most closely related free-living strains.

The lichen association is a close symbiosis. It extends the ecological range of both partners but is not always obligatory for their growth and reproduction in natural environments, since many of the algal symbionts can live independently. A prominent example is the alga &quot;Trentepohlia&quot;, which forms orange-coloured populations on tree trunks and suitable rock faces. Lichen propagules (diaspores) typically contain cells from both partners, although the fungal components of so-called &quot;fringe species&quot; rely instead on algal cells dispersed by the &quot;core species&quot;.

The same cyanobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners. The same phycobiont species can occur in association with different fungal species as lichen partners. More than one phycobiont may be present in a single thallus.

A single lichen may contain several algal genotypes. These multiple genotypes may better enable response to adaptation to environmental changes, and enable the lichen to inhabit a wider range of environments.

===Controversy over classification method and species names===
There are about 20,000 known lichen species. But what is meant by &quot;species&quot; is different from what is meant by biological species in plants, animals, or fungi, where being the same species implies that there is a common ancestral lineage. Because lichens are combinations of members of two or even three different biological kingdoms, these components &quot;must&quot; have a &quot;different&quot; ancestral lineage from each other. By convention, lichens are still called &quot;species&quot; anyway, and are classified according to the species of their fungus, not the species of the algae or cyanobacteria. Lichens are given the same scientific name (binomial name) as the fungus in them, which may cause some confusion. The alga bears its own scientific name, which has no relationship to the name of the lichen or fungus.

Depending on context, &quot;lichenized fungus&quot; may refer to the entire lichen, or to the fungus when it is in the lichen, which can be grown in culture in isolation from the algae or cyanobacteria. Some algae and cyanobacteria are found naturally living outside of the lichen. The fungal, algal, or cyanobacterial component of a lichen can be grown by itself in culture. When growing by themselves, the fungus, algae, or cyanobacteria have very different properties than those of the lichen. Lichen properties such as growth form, physiology, and biochemistry, are very different from the combination of the properties of the fungus and the algae or cyanobacteria.

The same fungus growing in combination with different algae or cyanobacteria, can produce lichens that are very different in most properties, meeting non-DNA criteria for being different &quot;species&quot;. Historically, these different combinations were classified as different species. When the fungus is identified as being the same using modern DNA methods, these apparently different species get reclassified as the &quot;same&quot; species under the current (2014) convention for classification by fungal component. This has led to debate about this classification convention. These apparently different &quot;species&quot; have their own independent evolutionary history.

There is also debate as to the appropriateness of giving the same binomial name to the fungus, and to the lichen that combines that fungus with an alga or cyanobacterium (synecdoche). This is especially the case when combining the same fungus with different algae or cyanobacteria produces dramatically different lichen organisms, which would be considered different species by any measure other than the DNA of the fungal component. If the whole lichen produced by the same fungus growing in association with different algae or cyanobacteria, were to be classified as different &quot;species&quot;, the number of &quot;lichen species&quot; would be greater.

===Diversity===
The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the Ascomycota, with about 40% of species forming such an association. Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as saprotrophs or plant parasites (for example, the Leotiales, Dothideales, and Pezizales). Other lichen fungi occur in only five orders in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders Graphidales, Gyalectales, Peltigerales, Pertusariales, and Teloschistales). Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont. Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned fungi imperfecti, a catch-all category for fungi whose sexual form of reproduction has never been observed. Comparatively few basidiomycetes are lichenized, but these include agarics, such as species of &quot;Lichenomphalia&quot;, clavarioid fungi, such as species of &quot;Multiclavula&quot;, and corticioid fungi, such as species of &quot;Dictyonema&quot;.

===Identification methods===
Lichen identification uses growth form, microscopy and reactions to chemical tests.

The outcome of the &quot;Pd test&quot; is called &quot;Pd&quot;, which is also used as an abbreviation for the chemical used in the test, para-phenylenediamine. If putting a drop on a lichen turns an area bright yellow to orange, this helps identify it as belonging to either the genus &quot;Cladonia&quot; or &quot;Lecanora&quot;.

=== Evolution and paleontology ===
The fossil record for lichens is poor. The extreme habitats that lichens dominate, such as tundra, mountains, and deserts, are not ordinarily conducive to producing fossils. There are fossilized lichens embedded in amber. The fossilized &quot;Anzia&quot; is found in pieces of amber in northern Europe and dates back approximately 40 million years. Lichen fragments are also found in fossil leaf beds, such as &quot;Lobaria&quot; from Trinity County in northern California, US, dating back to the early to middle Miocene.

The oldest fossil lichen in which both symbiotic partners have been recovered is &quot;Winfrenatia&quot;, an early zygomycetous (Glomeromycotan) lichen symbiosis that may have involved controlled parasitism, is permineralized in the Rhynie Chert of Scotland, dating from early Early Devonian, about 400 million years ago. The slightly older fossil &quot;Spongiophyton&quot; has also been interpreted as a lichen on morphological and isotopic grounds, although the isotopic basis is decidedly shaky. It has been demonstrated that Silurian-Devonian fossils &quot;Nematothallus&quot; and &quot;Prototaxites&quot; were lichenized. Thus lichenized Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were a component of Early Silurian-Devonian terrestrial ecosystems. Newer research suggests that lichen evolved after the evolution of land plants.

The ancestral ecological state of both Ascomycota and Basidiomycota was probably saprobism, and independent lichenization events may have occurred multiple times. In 1995, Gargas and colleagues proposed that there were at least five independent origins of lichenization; three in the basidiomycetes and at least two in the Ascomycetes. Lutzoni et al. (2001) suggest lichenization probably evolved earlier and was followed by multiple independent losses. Some non-lichen-forming fungi may have secondarily lost the ability to form a lichen association. As a result, lichenization has been viewed as a highly successful nutritional strategy.

Lichenized Glomeromycota may extend well back into the Precambrian. Lichen-like fossils consisting of coccoid cells (cyanobacteria?) and thin filaments (mucoromycotinan Glomeromycota?) are permineralized in marine phosphorite of the Doushantuo Formation in southern China. These fossils are thought to be 551 to 635 million years old or Ediacaran. Ediacaran acritarchs also have many similarities with Glomeromycotan vesicles and spores. It has also been claimed that Ediacaran fossils including &quot;Dickinsonia&quot;, were lichens, although this claim is controversial. Endosymbiotic Glomeromycota comparable with living &quot;Geosiphon&quot; may extend back into the Proterozoic in the form of 1500 million year old &quot;Horodyskia&quot; and 2200 million year old &quot;Diskagma&quot;. Discovery of these fossils suggest that fungi developed symbiotic partnerships with photoautotrophs long before the evolution of vascular plants, though the Ediacaran lichen hypothesis is largely rejected due to an inappropriate definition of lichens based on taphonomy and substrate ecology. However, a 2019 study by the same scientist who rejected the Ediacaran lichen hypothesis, Nelsen, used new time-calibrated phylogenies to conclude that there is no evidence of lichen before the existence of vascular plants.

Lecanoromycetes, one of the most common classes of lichen-forming fungi, diverged from its ancestor, which may have also been lichen forming, around 258 million years ago, during the late Paleozoic period. However, the closely related clade Euritiomycetes appears to have become lichen-forming only 52 million years ago, during the early Cenozoic period.

== Ecology and interactions with environment ==

===Substrates and habitats===

Lichens grow on and in a wide range of substrates and habitats, including some of the most extreme conditions on earth. They are abundant growing on bark, leaves, and hanging from epiphyte branches in rain forests and in temperate woodland. They grow on bare rock, walls, gravestones, roofs, and exposed soil surfaces. They can survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth: arctic tundra, hot dry deserts, rocky coasts, and toxic slag heaps. They can live inside solid rock, growing between the grains, and in the soil as part of a biological soil crust in arid habitats such as deserts. Some lichens do not grow on anything, living out their lives blowing about the environment.

When growing on mineral surfaces, some lichens slowly decompose their substrate by chemically degrading and physically disrupting the minerals, contributing to the process of weathering by which rocks are gradually turned into soil. While this contribution to weathering is usually benign, it can cause problems for artificial stone structures. For example, there is an ongoing lichen growth problem on Mount Rushmore National Memorial that requires the employment of mountain-climbing conservators to clean the monument.

Lichens are not parasites on the plants they grow on, but only use them as a substrate. The fungi of some lichen species may &quot;take over&quot; the algae of other lichen species. Lichens make their own food from their photosynthetic parts and by absorbing minerals from the environment. Lichens growing on leaves may have the appearance of being parasites on the leaves, but they are not. Some lichens in &quot;Diploschistes&quot; parasitise other lichens. &quot;Diploschistes muscorum&quot; starts its development in the tissue of a host &quot;Cladonia&quot; species.
In the arctic tundra, lichens, together with mosses and liverworts, make up the majority of the ground cover, which helps insulate the ground and may provide forage for grazing animals. An example is &quot;reindeer moss&quot;, which is a lichen, not a moss.

There are only two species of known permanently submerged lichens; &quot;Hydrothyria venosa&quot; is found in fresh water environments, and &quot;Verrucaria serpuloides&quot; is found in marine environments.

A crustose lichen that grows on rock is called a &quot;saxicolous lichen&quot;. Crustose lichens that grow on the rock are epilithic, and those that grow immersed inside rock, growing between the crystals with only their fruiting bodies exposed to the air, are called &quot;endolithic lichens&quot;. A crustose lichen that grows on bark is called a &quot;corticolous lichen&quot;. A lichen that grows on wood from which the bark has been stripped is called a &quot;lignicolous lichen&quot;. Lichens that grow immersed inside plant tissues are called &quot;endophloidic lichens&quot; or &quot;endophloidal lichens&quot;. Lichens that use leaves as substrates, whether the leaf is still on the tree or on the ground, are called &quot;epiphyllous&quot; or &quot;foliicolous&quot;. A &quot;terricolous lichen&quot; grows on the soil as a substrate. Many squamulose lichens are terricolous. &quot;Umbilicate lichens&quot; are foliose lichens that are attached to the substrate at only one point. A &quot;vagrant lichen&quot; is not attached to a substrate at all, and lives its life being blown around by the wind.

===Lichens and soils===
In addition to distinct physical mechanisms by which lichens break down raw stone, studies indicate lichens attack stone chemically, entering newly chelated minerals into the ecology. The substances exuded by lichens, known for their strong ability to bind and sequester metals, along with the common formation of new minerals, especially metal oxalates, and the traits of the substrates they alter, all highlight the important role lichens play in the process of chemical weathering. Over time, this activity creates new fertile soil from stone.

Lichens may be important in contributing nitrogen to soils in some deserts through being eaten, along with their rock substrate, by snails, which then defecate, putting the nitrogen into the soils. Lichens help bind and stabilize soil sand in dunes. In deserts and semi-arid areas, lichens are part of extensive, living biological soil crusts, essential for maintaining the soil structure.

===Ecological interactions===
Lichens are pioneer species, among the first living things to grow on bare rock or areas denuded of life by a disaster. Lichens may have to compete with plants for access to sunlight, but because of their small size and slow growth, they thrive in places where higher plants have difficulty growing. Lichens are often the first to settle in places lacking soil, constituting the sole vegetation in some extreme environments such as those found at high mountain elevations and at high latitudes. Some survive in the tough conditions of deserts, and others on frozen soil of the Arctic regions.

A major ecophysiological advantage of lichens is that they are poikilohydric (&quot;poikilo&quot;- variable, &quot;hydric&quot;- relating to water), meaning that though they have little control over the status of their hydration, they can tolerate irregular and extended periods of severe desiccation. Like some mosses, liverworts, ferns and a few resurrection plants, upon desiccation, lichens enter a metabolic suspension or stasis (known as cryptobiosis) in which the cells of the lichen symbionts are dehydrated to a degree that halts most biochemical activity. In this cryptobiotic state, lichens can survive wider extremes of temperature, radiation and drought in the harsh environments they often inhabit.

Lichens do not have roots and do not need to tap continuous reservoirs of water like most higher plants, thus they can grow in locations impossible for most plants, such as bare rock, sterile soil or sand, and various artificial structures such as walls, roofs, and monuments. Many lichens also grow as epiphytes (&quot;epi&quot;- on the surface, &quot;phyte&quot;- plant) on plants, particularly on the trunks and branches of trees. When growing on plants, lichens are not parasites; they do not consume any part of the plant nor poison it. Lichens produce allelopathic chemicals that inhibit the growth of mosses. Some ground-dwelling lichens, such as members of the subgenus &quot;Cladina&quot; (reindeer lichens), produce allelopathic chemicals that leach into the soil and inhibit the germination of seeds, spruce and other plants. Stability (that is, longevity) of their substrate is a major factor of lichen habitats. Most lichens grow on stable rock surfaces or the bark of old trees, but many others grow on soil and sand. In these latter cases, lichens are often an important part of soil stabilization; indeed, in some desert ecosystems, vascular (higher) plant seeds cannot become established except in places where lichen crusts stabilize the sand and help retain water.

Lichens may be eaten by some animals, such as reindeer, living in arctic regions. The larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species feed exclusively on lichens. These include common footman and marbled beauty. They are very low in protein and high in carbohydrates, making them unsuitable for some animals. The Northern flying squirrel uses it for nesting, food and winter water.

=== Effects of air pollution ===

If lichens are exposed to air pollutants at all times, without any deciduous parts, they are unable to avoid the accumulation of pollutants. Also lacking stomata and a cuticle, lichens may absorb aerosols and gases over the entire thallus surface from which they may readily diffuse to the photobiont layer. Because lichens do not possess roots, their primary source of most elements is the air, and therefore elemental levels in lichens often reflect the accumulated composition of ambient air. The processes by which atmospheric deposition occurs include fog and dew, gaseous absorption, and dry deposition. Consequently, environmental studies with lichens emphasize their feasibility as effective biomonitors of atmospheric quality.

Not all lichens are equally sensitive to air pollutants, so different lichen species show different levels of sensitivity to specific atmospheric pollutants. The sensitivity of a lichen to air pollution is directly related to the energy needs of the mycobiont, so that the stronger the dependency of the mycobiont on the photobiont, the more sensitive the lichen is to air pollution. Upon exposure to air pollution, the photobiont may use metabolic energy for repair of its cellular structures that would otherwise be used for maintenance of its photosynthetic activity, therefore leaving less metabolic energy available for the mycobiont. The alteration of the balance between the photobiont and mycobiont can lead to the breakdown of the symbiotic association. Therefore, lichen decline may result not only from the accumulation of toxic substances, but also from altered nutrient supplies that favor one symbiont over the other.

This interaction between lichens and air pollution has been used as a means of monitoring air quality since 1859, with more systematic methods developed by William Nylander in 1866.
== Human use ==


=== Food ===

Lichens are eaten by many different cultures across the world. Although some lichens are only eaten in times of famine, others are a staple food or even a delicacy. Two obstacles are often encountered when eating lichens: lichen polysaccharides are generally indigestible to humans, and lichens usually contain mildly toxic secondary compounds that should be removed before eating. Very few lichens are poisonous, but those high in vulpinic acid or usnic acid are toxic. Most poisonous lichens are yellow.

In the past, Iceland moss (&quot;Cetraria islandica&quot;) was an important source of food for humans in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. &quot;Bryoria fremontii&quot; (edible horsehair lichen) was an important food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested reindeer lichen (&quot;Cladina&quot; spp.) after they remove it from the rumen of caribou or reindeer that have been killed. Rock tripe (&quot;Umbilicaria&quot; spp. and &quot;Lasalia&quot; spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America, and one species, &quot;Umbilicaria esculenta&quot;, (&quot;iwatake&quot; in Japanese) is used in a variety of traditional Korean and Japanese foods.

=== Lichenometry ===

Lichenometry is a technique used to determine the age of exposed rock surfaces based on the size of lichen thalli. Introduced by Beschel in the 1950s, the technique has found many applications. it is used in archaeology, palaeontology, and geomorphology. It uses the presumed regular but slow rate of lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock. Measuring the diameter (or other size measurement) of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface indicates the length of time since the rock surface was first exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years. Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period. The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera &quot;Rhizocarpon&quot; (e.g. the species &quot;Rhizocarpon geographicum&quot;, map lichen) and &quot;Xanthoria&quot;.

===Biodegradation===
Lichens have been shown to degrade polyester resins, as can be seen in archaeological sites in the Roman city of Baelo Claudia in Spain. Lichens can accumulate several environmental pollutants such as lead, copper, and radionuclides. Some species of lichen, such as &quot;Parmelia sulcata&quot; (called a hammered shield lichen, among other names) and &quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot; (lung lichen), and many in the &quot;Cladonia&quot; genus, have been shown to produce serine proteases capable of the degradation of pathogenic forms of prion protein (PrP), which may be useful in treating contaminated environmental reservoirs.

=== Dyes ===
Many lichens produce secondary compounds, including pigments that reduce harmful amounts of sunlight and powerful toxins that deter herbivores or kill bacteria. These compounds are very useful for lichen identification, and have had economic importance as dyes such as cudbear or primitive antibiotics.

A pH indicator (which can indicate acidic or basic substances) called litmus is a dye extracted from the lichen &quot;Roccella tinctoria&quot; (&quot;dyer&#x27;s weed&quot;) by boiling. It gives its name to the well-known litmus test.

Traditional dyes of the Scottish Highlands for Harris tweed and other traditional cloths were made from lichens, including the orange &quot;Xanthoria parietina&quot; (&quot;common orange lichen&quot;) and the grey foliaceous &quot;Parmelia saxatilis&quot; common on rocks and known colloquially as &quot;crottle&quot;.

There are reports dating almost 2,000 years old of lichens being used to make purple and red dyes. Of great historical and commercial significance are lichens belonging to the family &quot;Roccellaceae&quot;, commonly called orchella weed or orchil. Orcein and other lichen dyes have largely been replaced by synthetic versions.

===Traditional medicine and research===
Historically, in traditional medicine of Europe, &quot;Lobaria pulmonaria&quot; was collected in large quantities as &quot;lungwort&quot;, due to its lung-like appearance (the &quot;doctrine of signatures&quot; suggesting that herbs can treat body parts that they physically resemble).Similarly, &quot;Peltigera leucophlebia&quot; (&quot;ruffled freckled pelt&quot;) was used as a supposed cure for thrush, due to the resemblance of its cephalodia to the appearance of the disease.

Lichens produce metabolites being researched for their potential therapeutic or diagnostic value. Some metabolites produced by lichens are structurally and functionally similar to broad-spectrum antibiotics while few are associated respectively to antiseptic similarities. Usnic acid is the most commonly studied metabolite produced by lichens. It is also under research as a bactericidal agent against &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; and &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

===Aesthetic appeal===

Colonies of lichens may be spectacular in appearance, dominating the surface of the visual landscape as part of the aesthetic appeal to visitors of Yosemite National Park, Sequoia National Park, and the Bay of Fires. Orange and yellow lichens add to the ambience of desert trees, tundras, and rocky seashores. Intricate webs of lichens hanging from tree branches add a mysterious aspect to forests. Fruticose lichens are used in model railroading and other modeling hobbies as a material for making miniature trees and shrubs.

===In literature===
In early Midrashic literature, the Hebrew word &quot;vayilafeth&quot; in Ruth 3:8 is explained as referring to Ruth entwining herself around Boaz like lichen. The 10th century Arab physician Al-Tamimi mentions lichens dissolved in vinegar and rose water being used in his day for the treatment of skin diseases and rashes.

The plot of John Wyndham&#x27;s science fiction novel &quot;Trouble with Lichen&quot; revolves around an anti-aging chemical extracted from a lichen.

==History==
Although lichens had been recognized as organisms for quite some time, it was not until 1867, when Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener proposed his dual theory of lichens, that lichens are a combination of fungi with algae or cyanobacteria, whereby the true nature of the lichen association began to emerge. Schwendener&#x27;s hypothesis, which at the time lacked experimental evidence, arose from his extensive analysis of the anatomy and development in lichens, algae, and fungi using a light microscope. Many of the leading lichenologists at the time, such as James Crombie and Nylander, rejected Schwendener&#x27;s hypothesis because the consensus was that all living organisms were autonomous.

Other prominent biologists, such as Heinrich Anton de Bary, Albert Bernhard Frank, Beatrix Potter, Melchior Treub and Hermann Hellriegel, were not so quick to reject Schwendener&#x27;s ideas and the concept soon spread into other areas of study, such as microbial, plant, animal and human pathogens. When the complex relationships between pathogenic microorganisms and their hosts were finally identified, Schwendener&#x27;s hypothesis began to gain popularity. Further experimental proof of the dual nature of lichens was obtained when Eugen Thomas published his results in 1939 on the first successful re-synthesis experiment.

In the 2010s, a new facet of the fungi–algae partnership was discovered. Toby Spribille and colleagues found that many types of lichen that were long thought to be ascomycete–algae pairs were actually ascomycete–basidiomycete–algae trios. The third symbiotic partner in many lichens is a basidiomycete yeast.
